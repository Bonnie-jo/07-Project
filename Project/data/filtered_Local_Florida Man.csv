4,8,Police: Florida man says he shot wife over 'disrespect',"PLANTATION, Fla. - A 73-year-old man shot his wife in the face this week inside their Plantation home, then walked to a neighbor's house and confessed that he'd killed her, authorities said.

Plantation police investigators said Fernando De Baere told them he shot Marisa Sherman, 47, because she wouldn't stop speaking disrespectfully.

Plantation police said De Baere shot her in the face, returned his .38-caliber handgun to a bedroom and then walked to a neighbor’s house to confess. The neighbor called 911.

Police said De Baere admitted to shooting his wife ""one or two times"" in the face while standing about 3 feet away from her.

De Baere was charged with murder and jailed without bond Saturday. Records did not show if he has an attorney.

Police say De Baere told them he shot his wife because he did not like the way she was talking to him during an argument. A police report says De Baere told officers exactly where to find the weapon.

14,27,Florida man who stood on sunroof while driving accused of felony domestic violence,"POLK COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA ) - A driver made a lot of people laugh this week when he stood up on his sunroof with his car on cruise control while driving on Interstate 4. But the story behind the story isn't funny at all.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office said 70-year-old Leonard Olsen was arrested not only for driving recklessly, but also for false imprisonment and domestic violence by strangulation.

RELATED: Florida man arrested for hanging out sunroof while driving on I-4

According to an arrest report, Olsen is accused of choking a 69-year-old woman on April 30 after she took too long to come to bed. The woman told deputies she had bruises on her throat and a hoarse voice.

Days later, after the woman came home from dinner, he allegedly ripped up the dress she had been wearing, accused her of having an affair and called her a vulgar name. Then he asked her for one of her bras and threatened to destroy every bra in her dresser. When she eventually gave him a bra, he tore it apart and demanded that she give him the pair of underwear she had been wearing. When she told him she was still wearing the underwear, he began ""pulling on the underwear causing the victim's body to shake back and forth until the underwear came loose from the victim's body,"" an arrest report states.

Once he was through destroying all of her clothing, Olsen began blaring music so she couldn't fall asleep. This lasted several hours, according to the victim.

The next day, the victim awoke to Olsen slamming dresser drawers, turning the lights on and off, and blaring music. Deputies said he pushed her onto their bed, straddled her and put his hand on her throat, then placed his thumb on her mouth, which she bit. Olsen got off of her and blocked the doorway to prevent her from leaving the room. After a few minutes, he let her pass through the doorway and she called 911.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office said detectives made contact with Olsen by phone on Tuesday and he agreed to turn himself in.

As deputies were on their way to meet him, they learned he had been pulled over by the Florida Highway Patrol for driving recklessly.

Olsen was arrested and booked into the South County Jail, where he faces three counts of felony domestic battery on a person 65 or older, one count of felony false imprisonment and one count of felony domestic battery by strangulation.",http://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/lakeland-man-who-stood-on-sunroof-while-driving-accused-of-felony-domestic-violence/1997065259,2019-05-12T03:59:05Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

23,42,No charges for Florida man with obscene sticker on car,"LAKE CITY, Fla. - Charges have been dropped against a Florida man who refused to remove what a deputy considered an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

The State Attorney's Office in Columbia County filed court documents Thursday saying it won't prosecute Dillon Shane Webb, 23, who had been charged with obscenity and resisting an officer without violence. The filing said a valid defense could be raised under the First Amendment, which protects free speech.

An arrest report said a deputy stopped Webb in Lake City on Sunday because of a sexually explicit sticker. The deputy cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court.

Officials said the deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused. The deputy then charged Webb with resisting.

34,66,Charges dropped against Florida man arrested for 'obscene' sticker,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Charges have been dropped against a Lake City man who was arrested for having a window sticker on the rear window of his truck that deputies with the Columbia County Sheriff's Office said violated Florida's obscenity law.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said. Webb was released on a $2,500 bond.

In a filing from the State Attorney's Office, prosecutors told the court the charges were being dropped against Webb.

The Bonderud Law Firm of Jacksonville, which is representing Webb, released the following statement on Facebook, which includes the the filing from the State Attorney's Office:

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court, the report said. The deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused.

Webb said he wasn't even of the state's obscenity law, but after reviewing it since his arrest, he said it needs to be changed.

The billboard along State Road 535 reads, “Dear Walt Disney World Executives and HR, experienced EA/PA Professional seeking position as a WDW Assistant.""

It also provides his phone number and an email address, not to mention a hashtag to stay on par with these social times.

So how much did the billboard résumé set Fox back? ""I don’t want to say that because I don’t want my wife to divorce me. It’s worth it,"" he told WKMG.

And it kind of worked. A spokesperson for Walt Disney World released the following statement: ""We appreciate the creativity and encourage anyone interested in a role with us to apply at disneycareers.com.”

Fox isn’t the only Florida man using a billboard to get his message across.

The wacky, weird and wild world of Florida Man is getting its own show.

Oxygen Media, which announced in 2017 a full-time shift to true crime-related television, revealed Tuesday that a series based on ""America's most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State,"" has been added to the channel's projects.

There is no start date for the show, however, the series will be developed by Blumhouse Productions and Man vs. Robot. Blumhouse, founded by Jason Blum, an Academy Award nominee and Emmy Award winner, is known for producing low-budget horror films ""Get Out,"" ""The Purge"" and ""Insidious.""

Officials at Oxygen say the series, with the working title of ""Florida Man,"" will focus on ""America’s most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State and will unravel the strange twists and turns and try in vain to reason how and why this breed of killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension.""

A description of the show reads: ""When the murder is so bizarre, the motive so far-fetched and the crime so outlandish that it sounds like something from a Hollywood screenplay, there’s a good chance it was actually committed by a ‘Florida Man.’ ""

Yep. Sounds about right.

Other true crime shows in development at Oxygen include “The DNA of Murder;” “The Lover’s Lane Murders;” “Exploited;” “Framed by the Killer;” and “The Jane Doe Murders.”

The true-crime channel in 2018 was the fastest growing network in basic cable for the second consecutive year, according to Oxygen.

In March, users on social media got a kick out of Googling ""Florida Man"" with their birthday, which generated a Florida Man story that occurred on or near that day.

For example, Googling ""Florida Man September 14,"" which is Gov. Ron DeSantis' birthday — by default he's Florida Man because he leads the Sunshine State — this wacky story is generated: ""Shirtless Florida man is back to take on Hurricane Florence because the internet made it so.""

39,74,A Florida Man television series will happen this year,"Oxygen will pick up a television series based on Florida Man crime.

Florida’s most notorious will make it to Oxygen, the crime-focused cable television network, The Hollywood Reporter stated.

Since rebranding in 2017, Oxygen has created original content focusing on true crime. When it comes to Florida Man, Blumhouse TV will produce a series that focuses on “the most outrageous, notorious and craftiest killers from the Sunshine State.”

The Hollywood Reporter adds: “When a crime sounds like it came straight from a Hollywood screenplay, there's a good chance it was committed by a Florida Man.”

Oxygen’s Executive Vice President of Original Programming and Development, Rod Aissa, told the Hollywood Reporter, ""This year we’ve increased our original hours by more than 30 percent, and we'll keep ramping up our programming efforts as more fans flock to the network to experience best-in-class content.""

So, which Florida Man stories might be featured on the true crime-themed doc series? We don’t know for sure, but based on reports, the series will focus on murders and not the silly antics many love.

42,79,Jury finds Florida man guilty in alleged sleepwalking homicide,"A 12-person jury found Randy Herman Jr., 26, guilty of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston in March 25, 2017.

After about five hours of deliberations, a 12-person jury found Randy Herman Jr. guilty of first-degree murder this week in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston in 2017, rejecting the defense that he was sleepwalking when he attacked her in suburban West Palm Beach.

After the verdict was read Wednesday, both Preston’s family and Herman’s family teared up silently on opposite sides of the courtroom as Circuit Judge John Kastrenakes thanked the jury for its service of more than a week in the case. Before the judge sentenced Herman, 26, to the mandatory term of life in prison, Preston’s sister, Jordan, spoke briefly before the court.

As she tried to stifle her tears, she explained nothing has been the same since her sister was killed. The sisters and Herman had know each other since they were teenagers and lived together for more than six months at the home where she was attacked. Jordan Preston was not in the residence at the time of the fatal stabbing.

“The last few years without her have been awful. Our lives are totally different,” she said.

Outside the courtroom, Preston’s father, John, walked surrounded by more than a dozen family members and friends who came down from Pennsylvania for the trial.

“There’s no winners in this whole situation. Everybody’s losers,” he said.

Herman and his lawyers had argued he was sleepwalking when he stabbed Preston more than 20 times on the morning of March 25, 2017, and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors told the jury Herman’s actions were deliberate and not the product of an alleged sleepwalking episode.

Investigators said Preston had finished packing up and was ready to move to New York when Herman sent her a text message, asking her to pick up a shirt before she left to give to a friend. When Herman testified last week, he said he thought Preston had come back to the house that morning, he had given her a shirt, then they had hugged goodbye, she left and he went back to sleep.

“The next thing (I know), I’m standing over top of her and I have a knife in my hand, covered in blood,” Herman said. “I was confused. Scared. Didn’t know what to do. Didn’t know what happened.”

Herman then drove to a nearby park, called 911 and told them that even though he didn’t remember what had happened, he said he must have been the one that killed Preston because no one else was home.

Over the course of the trial, which began with testimony April 30, the jury heard from Palm Beach County sheriff’s detectives; Herman; Jordan Preston; Kyle McGregor, the man who last saw Preston alive; as well as from experts who testified both for against the sleepwalking defense.

In his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant Public Defender Joseph Walsh said there was no logical answer to what happened. There was no motive, no history of violence and no issues between Herman and Preston.

“There is no other rational explanation for this killing other than this could have been sleepwalking,” Walsh said.

Dr. Charles Patrick Ewing, a forensic psychologist, testified Monday that he was “truly puzzled” by the case until he learned of Herman’s history of sleepwalking.

“That really made sense to me, because I really couldn’t make any other sense of the case,” Ewing said.

He said while sleepwalking is uncommon and sleepwalking homicides are even less likely, they do happen and Herman met the criteria: The person attacked was well-loved by the attacker, there appeared to be no motive in the case, Herman said he couldn’t remember anything from the attack and he had a history of sleepwalking.

Herman’s mother, Kathi Adams, testified that she had witnessed several episodes as Herman was a child, but Jordan Preston said in the years she had known him and lived with him, she never saw him sleepwalk.

On Tuesday, prosecutors had Dr. Wade C. Myers, a forensic psychiatrist, testify and say that there’s no way Herman could have slept through the 20-plus stabs he inflicted on Preston because it was too complex of an action.

Instead, he suggested the motive in the killing may be sexually based, drawing from an alleged incident the night before the stabbing where Herman reportedly hid in Brooke Preston’s closet naked after a day of drinking heavily. No one saw the alleged incident and it was only known because Preston reportedly told McGregor and asked to spend the night with him.

Preston’s sister testified that there was no sexual or romantic interested between herself, her sister or Herman.

Over the years, there have been several high-profile murder cases where those accused have claimed sleepwalking as a defense for their actions and have had their juries rule both for and against them.

In 2015, Joseph Mitchell was found not guilty of strangling his 4-year-old son to death after his attorneys argued he was sleepwalking at the time of the attack in North Carolina. In 1999, an Arizona man was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his wife after he claimed he was sleepwalking when he stabbed her and then dragged her to the pool and held her head under water.

During his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant State Attorney Reid Scott said Herman was not sleepwalking and that he knew what he was doing.

“This is skin, this is bone, this is muscle (he’s stabbing,)” he said. “You’re not going to sleepwalk through that.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/zz/news/20190510/jury-finds-florida-man-guilty-in-alleged-sleepwalking-homicide?rssfeed=true,2019-05-10T04:20:00Z,Sarasota Herald,Florida Man,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

President Donald Trump appeared before a raucous crowd of supporters for another one of his MAGA rallies in Panama City Beach, FL, on Wednesday. There, he joined the audience in laughing at an impromptu suggestion from the crowd: what if the U.S. just murdered undocumented immigrants?



“When you have 15,000 people marching up, and you have hundreds and hundreds of people, and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great,” Trump said. “And don’t forget, we don’t let them and we can’t let them use weapons. We can’t. Other countries do. We can’t. I would never do that. But how do you stop these people?”

At that point an as-of-yet unidentified member of the audience shouted “Shoot them!” Trump simply chuckled along with the crowd, noting, “That’s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement.” Good lord.",https://splinternews.com/here-is-trump-loving-a-florida-mans-joke-about-murderin-1834635814,2019-05-09T12:28:00Z,Splinter,Florida Man,"8551 NW 30th Terrace, Doral, FL 33122",FL,33122

50,93,"Florida man arrested, refused to remove bumper sticker from vehicle","LAKE CITY, Fla. - A Lake City man who was jailed after refusing to remove what authorities called an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window said Tuesday that he is fighting the charges and will defend his constitutional right to free speech.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said.

Webb told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit against the sheriff's office.

""I'm tired of police forces thinking they are above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,"" Webb said.

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

Wedd said the deputy seemed angry from the start of the traffic stop.

""Like the whole time, he was just really rude,"" Webb told the AP. ""It just felt to me like his goal was to get me in jail.""

The deputy said he asked Webb how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words, and Webb said that ""it would be up to the parent.""

Webb told the AP that he didn't imagine the sticker doing any serious damage to children.

""I've had parents drive by me with their kids taking pictures,"" Webb said. ""They point and laugh and giggle, and they go on about their day.""

Webb said he had the sticker on his truck for less than a week before his traffic stop. He said he and several friends had all decided to get similar stickers as a group joke.

""I guess this cop just didn't find it funny, and he just thought he has to put me in jail,"" Webb said.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court, the report said. The deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused.

""I said I'm not removing any letters on my sticker because that's in violation of my First Amendment rights as a tax-paying citizen,"" Webb said.

The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail. Webb was released an hour later on $2,500 bond.

Webb's vehicle had been towed when he was arrested. He said the sticker was still in place when he retrieved the vehicle.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida released a statement Tuesday questioning why the sheriff's office was wasting resources on such a traffic stop.

""Shouldn't police officers spend their time serving and protecting communities and not pulling Floridians over for speech that is already protected by the First Amendment?"" ACLU spokeswoman Casey Bruce-White said in a statement. ""Using the excuse that a child would see and ask questions about this particular bumper sticker is absurd.""

The sheriff's office told the AP that deputy had probable cause of a violation of criminal law and took action. ""If the law is faulty then the legislature can address that or if the law is unconstitutional then the judiciary will address it, Sgt. Murray Smith said, adding that the defendant will have his day in court.

Webb said he wasn't even aware of the state's obscenity law, but after reviewing it since his arrest, he said it needs to be changed. He acknowledged that his sticker could be considered vulgar by some, but the law doesn't really define what that is.

""What's vulgar to me might not be vulgar to somebody else,"" Webb said.

LAKE CITY, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a Florida man was jailed after refusing to remove an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

A Columbia County Sheriff's Office report says 23-year-old Dillon Shane Webb was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence.

It says a deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite. The sticker said ""I eat a--,"" according to the Lake City Reporter.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court.

Officials say the deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part but Webb refused, citing his First Amendment free speech rights. The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail.

52,98,Florida man arrested over vulgar sticker on truck,"After being given a notice to appear, the driver refused to remove part of the sticker, citing the First Amendment. That's when the deputy arrested him.

A Lake City man with a crude sticker on the back window of his Chevy truck ended up in the Columbia County jail Sunday after he refused to alter the offending words, citing his right to free speech.

A Columbia County sheriff's deputy pulled the pickup over on U.S. 90 around 5:50 p.m. after seeing the sticker — which stated ""I EAT A**"" in white letters, according to an arrest report. The deputy considered the statement a violation of Florida obscenity laws.

The driver and owner of the truck, Dillon Shane Webb, 23, became defensive when the deputy explained why he had been pulled over.

""They're just words,"" he said, according to the deputy's account.

""I then asked Dillon how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words,"" the report says. Webb responded that it would be up to the parent.

The deputy issued a notice to appear on the obscenity violation, a second-degree misdemeanor.

Then, the deputy wrote, ""I allowed him to remove one of the letters from the word 'A**' so the statement would no longer be derogatory."" But, he said, Webb refused to do so, citing the First Amendment.

That's when the deputy arrested him on a charge of resisting an officer without violence, a first-degree misdemeanor, and took him to jail. The truck was towed.

Bail was set at $2,500, and Webb was released at 8:50 that evening.

58,106,Florida man Randy Herman Jr. gets life for slaying he blamed on sleepwalking,"Randy Herman Jr., 26, received a life sentence in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston on March 25, 2017.

WEST PALM BEACH — After about five hours of deliberations, a 12-person jury found Randy Herman Jr. guilty of first-degree murder Wednesday in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston in 2017, rejecting the defense that he was sleepwalking when he attacked her in suburban West Palm Beach.

After the verdict was read, both Preston's family and Herman's family teared up silently on opposite sides of the courtroom as Circuit Judge John Kastrenakes thanked the jury for its service of more than a week in the case. Before the judge sentenced Herman, 26, to the mandatory term of life in prison, Preston's sister, Jordan, spoke briefly before the court.

As she tried to stifle her tears, she explained nothing has been the same since her sister was killed. The sisters and Herman had know each other since they were teenagers and lived together for more than six months at the home where she was attacked. Jordan Preston was not in the residence at the time of the fatal stabbing.

""The last few years without her have been awful. Our lives are totally different,"" she said.

Outside the courtroom, Preston's father, John, walked surrounded by more than a dozen family members and friends who came down from Pennsylvania for the trial.

""There's no winners in this whole situation. Everybody's losers,"" he said.

Herman and his lawyers had argued he was sleepwalking when he stabbed Preston more than 20 times on the morning of March 25, 2017, and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors told the jury Herman's actions were deliberate and not the product of an alleged sleepwalking episode.

Investigators said Preston had finished packing up and was ready to move to New York when Herman sent her a text message, asking her to pick up a shirt before she left to give to a friend. When Herman testified last week, he said he thought Preston had come back to the house that morning, he had given her a shirt, then they had hugged goodbye, she left and he went back to sleep.

“The next thing (I know), I’m standing over top of her and I have a knife in my hand, covered in blood,” Herman said. “I was confused. Scared. Didn’t know what to do. Didn’t know what happened.”

Herman then drove to a nearby park, called 911 and told them that even though he didn't remember what had happened, he said he must have been the one that killed Preston because no one else was home.

Over the course of the trial, which began with testimony April 30, the jury heard from Palm Beach County sheriff's detectives; Herman; Jordan Preston; Kyle McGregor, the man who last saw Preston alive; as well as from experts who testified both for against the sleepwalking defense.

In his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant Public Defender Joseph Walsh said there was no logical answer to what happened. There was no motive, no history of violence and no issues between Herman and Preston.

“There is no other rational explanation for this killing other than this could have been sleepwalking,"" Walsh said.

Dr. Charles Patrick Ewing, a forensic psychologist, testified Monday that he was ""truly puzzled"" by the case until he learned of Herman's history of sleepwalking.

“That really made sense to me, because I really couldn’t make any other sense of the case,” Ewing said.

He said while sleepwalking is uncommon and sleepwalking homicides are even less likely, they do happen and Herman met the criteria: The person attacked was well-loved by the attacker, there appeared to be no motive in the case, Herman said he couldn't remember anything from the attack and he had a history of sleepwalking.

Herman's mother, Kathi Adams, testified that she had witnessed several episodes as Herman was a child, but Jordan Preston said in the years she had known him and lived with him, she never saw him sleepwalk.

On Tuesday, prosecutors had Dr. Wade C. Myers, a forensic psychiatrist, testify and say that there's no way Herman could have slept through the 20-plus stabs he inflicted on Preston because it was too complex of an action.

Instead, he suggested the motive in the killing may be sexually based, drawing from an alleged incident the night before the stabbing where Herman reportedly hid in Brooke Preston's closet naked after a day of drinking heavily. No one saw the alleged incident and it was only known because Preston reportedly told McGregor and asked to spend the night with him.

Preston's sister testified that there was no sexual or romantic interest between herself, her sister or Herman.

Over the years, there have been several high-profile murder cases where those accused have claimed sleepwalking as a defense for their actions and have had their juries rule both for and against them.

In 2015, Joseph Mitchell was found not guilty of strangling his 4-year-old son to death after his attorneys argued he was sleepwalking at the time of the attack in North Carolina. In 1999, an Arizona man was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his wife after he claimed he was sleepwalking when he stabbed her and then dragged her to the pool and held her head under water.

During his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant State Attorney Reid Scott said Herman was not sleepwalking and that he knew what he was doing.

""This is skin, this is bone, this is muscle (he's stabbing,)"" he said. ""You're not going to sleepwalk through that.""",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190509/florida-man-randy-herman-jr-gets-life-for-slaying-he-blamed-on-sleepwalking?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T10:00:53Z,The Ledger,Florida Man,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815
59,109,"Dog recovering after Florida man drags him behind truck, deputies say","HERNANDO COUNTY, Fla. - A dog that was dragged behind behind a truck is recovering and in good spirits, but the search is still on for the man accused of abusing him.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office on Wednesday announced that they were seeking the dog's owner, 48-year-old Gregory Tousignant, on an animal cruelty charge.

Deputies said Tousignant tied a piece of rope that was attached to the 1-year-old pit bull's collar to the back bumper of a truck then drove down Northcliffe Boulevard in Spring Hill Friday morning. The dog was eventually able to get loose from his collar.

Jan Harwood of Nature Coast Animal Wellness & Surgical Center in Weeki Wachee told WFTS that she saw the incident happen and immediately rendered aid to the dog, now named Ollie.

""It’s the most horrific thing I honestly have ever seen and I can’t get it out of my head,"" Harwood told the TV station.

The dog is now recovering at the veterinary clinic. Photos posted on the clinic's Facebook page show road-rash type injuries to Ollie's left side, including on his paws and face.

Since then, more recent updates show Ollie cuddling with clinic staff, wagging his tail and wearing the cone of shame to stop him from licking.

Despite being sore, staff said Ollie appears to be in good spirits and loves attention.

""He is tolerating his treatment without hesitation and that tail is wagging like nothing ever happened,"" the clinic posted on its Facebook page. ""What a sweet baby we have here.""

WTSP reports that Ollie will be available for treatment once his wounds heal.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office is asking anyone with information concerning Tousignant's whereabouts to call 352-754-6830.

60,112,Florida man arrested after refusing to remove obscene sticker from vehicle,"MIAMI - A Florida man who was jailed after refusing to remove what authorities called an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window said Tuesday that he is fighting the charges and will defend his constitutional right to free speech.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said.

Webb told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit against the sheriff's office.

""I'm tired of police forces thinking they are above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,"" Webb said.

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

Wedd said the deputy seemed angry from the start of the traffic stop.

""Like the whole time, he was just really rude,"" Webb told the AP. ""It just felt to me like his goal was to get me in jail.""

The deputy said he asked Webb how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words, and Webb said that ""it would be up to the parent.""

Webb told the AP that he didn't imagine the sticker doing any serious damage to children.

Police arrested Gary Wayne Anderson, 68, Saturday after he crashed his lawn mower into a Haines City police vehicle.

An officer was inside a local business when he heard a loud crash from outside. After walking outside, the officer found Anderson sitting atop a lawn mower with a trailer.

Anderson admitted to hitting the vehicle while riding his lawn mower and was given a field sobriety test, which he failed.

While at the police department, Anderson claimed to have been poisoned by police and demanded to be taken to the hospital. At the hospital, Anderson's blood-alcohol content was registered at .241, more than three times the legal limit.

Cocaine was also found in Anderson's blood, but he said the police put the cocaine there.

According to police, Anderson's driver's license has been suspended since 1978 and he has two prior DUI convictions.

The Volusia County Sheriff's Office reported that 48-year-old Wade Leon McKeehan was arrested on a warrant after he turned himself in at the DeLand Police Department at 2 a.m. He is charged with possessing photos and video images portraying sexual performance by a child.

They said that detectives found 25,529 electronic images and videos in McKeehan's possession. The images portrayed children of both genders between ages 1 and 13 in sexually explicit situations.

The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office’s Child Exploitation Unit reportedly began investigating McKeehan in December 2018. A search warrant on his home was finally executed on March 20th. Electronic devices were seized for forensic examination and detectives interviewed him.

An arrest warrant for McKeehan was issued Friday, the Sheriff's Office said. He was taken into custody and transported to the Volusia County Branch Jail. He remains there on no bail allowed until his first appearance before a judge.

More charges are possible, the Sheriff's Office said. Detectives are still searching for any additional potential victims of sexual exploitation. Anyone who may have been a victim of this suspect or any similar case is urged to call the Child Exploitation Unit at (386) 323-3574.

74,144,"South Florida man stabs sleeping mother several times, deputies say","Ryan Guenot, 30, is accused of stabbing his mother several times while she was sleeping.

ROYAL PALM BEACH, Fla. - A South Florida man was arrested Friday after he attacked his sleeping mother, stabbing her several times, deputies said.

Ryan Guenot, 30, of Royal Palm Beach, faces a charge of attempted first-degree murder.

According to a Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office probable cause affidavit, Guenot's half-brother, Javier Gallardo, called 911 Friday morning and said his brother ""had cut his mother with a knife and left the residence.""

When deputies arrived, they found a large blood trail leading into the home and blood smears on a wall.

Gallardo told detectives he was sleeping in his room when he heard his mother screaming about 6 a.m. Gallardo said he pulled Guenot off her and put him in a headlock before Guenot broke free and ran out of the house.

Tina Guenot, 57, told detectives her son came home from SunFest about 3 a.m. She went back to sleep but woke up a few hours later ""to what felt like punches to her head.""

Detectives said Tina Guenot had a cut to the back of her head, three stab wounds to her face, two stab wounds to her chest and one cut across her neck.

""The tip of a knife was also discovered to be broken off inside Tina's head as a result of being stabbed,"" the affidavit said.

Ryan Guenot was later spotted along Okeechobee Boulevard and taken into custody. Detectives said he asked how his mother was doing.

During a recorded confession, Ryan Guenot said he came home and saw his mother sleeping in the living room. He said he went to sleep in his room but woke up at some point after falling asleep.

""Ryan initially said he did not recall any details but knew that he attacked his mother,"" the affidavit said. ""Ryan later added he woke up and vaguely remembered grabbing a knife from the kitchen drawer.""

According to the affidavit, Ryan Guenot went on to say that ""he proceeded to attack Tina with the goal of killing her. Ryan told me something in his head told him to kill his mom.""

Ryan Guenot was being held without bond at the main Palm Beach County jail.

Sheriff's spokeswoman Teri Barbera said Tina Guenot was in critical condition Friday at an area hospital.

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office said they arrested Robert Walls despite his attempt at disguise.

The sheriff's office says in a statement that when agents caught up with Walls last Thursday to arrest him, he admitted that he was using the wig as a disguise to elude them.

The sheriff's office says he was wanted by a fugitive task force seeking suspects from a major drug investigation that led to arrest warrants for more than 100 defendants.

Online court records show no attorney listed for Walls. He faces charges of solicitation to sell a controlled substance and criminal conspiracy.

85,162,Florida man receives toll violation for license plate he owned 25 years ago,"PORT ORANGE, Fla. - A Port Orange man is frustrated that the Florida Department of Transportation continues to send a bill to his Central Florida home for two toll violations that happened in South Florida last August.

""I wasn't even in the state of Florida at the time,"" said Thomas McMullen.

McMullen said he was on vacation in Canandaigua, New York, when the toll violation happened. The vehicle captured by the toll cameras is a tractor-trailer, something McMullen says he's never owned.

Not only that, he said he has not owned the license plate captured in the photo for almost 25 years.

""I may have thrown it in the garbage. I may have sold it. I don't know,"" said McMullen, who is an avid classic car collector.

He said he has bought and sold more than 100 cars in his lifetime and doesn't keep track of all of them or the tags that went with them.



He only collects special licesnse plates, including a Purple Heart plate that hangs on the wall in his garage.

""You know, I'm a soldier, and I fought for our country,"" McMullen said. ""This is a DAV tag of mine for Disabled (American) Veteran.""

McMullen said he has also bought old license plates on eBay as part of his classic car obsession. He had no idea that the license plates assigned to him would stay linked to him all these years later.

""I mean, this tag is 25 years old,"" McMullen said. ""Why am I responsible for this?""

McMullen said he kept calling the state to dispute the charges, but they kept sending him a bill. He said he just wants SunPass to stop sending him these bills and to find out what really happened.

""It's giving me a lot of aggravation,"" said McMullen. ""And I don't need any aggravation.""

That's why he called News 6 .

The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles confirms the license plate expired in 1995 and has not been renewed. The agency confirms unless the plate is reported lost or stolen, it will remain active and continue to be linked to the original owner.

But once we started digging deeper into McMullen's case, we discovered another mystery. The license plate on the 18-wheeler captured on camera may not even be McMullen's old plate after all.

If you zoom in on the picture, you can clearly see that the second zero on the plate is not like the first.

McMullen said the FDOT picked up the anomaly, and within an hour of our visit, the agency called him to say the plate in the picture whad been altered, and that the agency was waiving the toll charges.



News 6 checked McMullen’s account and discovered the charge for $47.25 has been officially erased.



What can you do with your old plates?

According to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, license plates are issued to the person, not the vehicle. So, when conducting a private sale of a vehicle, license plates stay with the seller, not the vehicle.



In addition, if you are not going to renew your license plate, you can return it to any tax collector's office, mail it to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, destroy it, or keep it in a safe place where no one can access it.



If you are going to sell a car privately, take off the license plate. You can then mail it back to The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles so the agency can take it out of circulation.

The department offers a sellers checklist to help consumers protect themselves in a private sale:

Apply for a demonstration-only temporary tag, if needed;

Conduct a vehicle identification number inspection, if necessary;

Record odometer reading on title;

Complete title transfer in a motor vehicle service center.

Remove license plate from the sold vehicle;

Surrender the license plate, if applicable;

File a Notice of Sale, form HSMV 82050.

Visit the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles website to learn more about buying and selling a vehicle.

What happens if your license plate is lost or stolen?

When the FLHSMV a customer completes the form and provides a copy of a police report or agency card containing the case number, the replacement will be issued at no charge.

Questions or discrepancies found on your SunPass bill can be addressed online here.

88,165,Sheriff's Office: Wanted Florida man hoped blonde wig would disguise him from deputies as he biked away,"Moral of the story from sheriff's office: Above all else DO NOT wear a hideous wig while trying to run from the Po/Po on a bicycle.

A Florida fugitive wanted on drug charges tried to elude deputies surrounding the home he was in Thursday by donning a long blonde wig and riding off on a bicycle, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office said.

The wig didn't work, and agents caught up with and arrested Robert “Bobby” Walls soon after watching him ride away, deputies said.

Walls later admitted he put the wig on in hopes that officers wouldn't recognize him and that he'd avoid arrest, deputies said.

Investigators had set up a perimeter around the residence after getting a tip he was there. Walls' warrant was one of over 100 in ""a significant drug investigation"" by the sheriff's office.

Walls was charged with conspiracy to possess controlled substance, solicitation to sell controlled substance, and unlawful use of a two-way device.

So here is the moral of the story,"" the sheriff's office posted on its Facebook page.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (WFLA) - A Florida man is behind bars after he allegedly beat a 3-year-old girl with a brick inside of a recycling bin and left her to die, The Miami Herald reported.

Tristin Tavares Bernard, 18, was arrested and charged early Friday morning with attempted second-degree murder, aggravated child abuse with great bodily harm and torture, and aggravated battery.

Police were called to a neighborhood in Miami Gardens at about 6 p.m. Thursday after a neighbor reported seeing Bernard beating the girl with a brick inside of a recycling bin.

Family members say Bernard is a relative who is mentally unstable.

The girl was being watched by her grandmother who told police she was babysitting the child when she lost track of her.

Sotomayor, who lives a block over, said he heard cries and saw Bernard hitting the girl in the head with the brick, then take off back to his mother's home, leaving the girl behind.

“She was in the bin and she was bleeding on the side of her head,” Jose Sotomayor, the witness, told CBS4. “Thank God I was able to save her life.”

The girl was rushed to Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood where she underwent surgery. She’s listed in critical condition.

116,214,Florida man accused of bilking clients seeking pregnancy surrogates,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. — A Florida man faces charges in Maryland that he defrauded clients of a company that offered to help locate and financially support pregnancy surrogates for people trying to become parents.

Gregory Ray Blosser, 37, was arrested Monday in Florida on a wire fraud charge and detained until a Friday hearing in Miami, according to federal prosecutors.

Blosser has operated The Surrogacy Group since 2012, with offices in Annapolis, Maryland, and Tampa, Florida. Clients paid Blosser tens of thousands of dollars to find surrogates and support them during pregnancies. Blosser failed to either locate suitable surrogates or pay for their fees or medical expenses after clients deposited money into escrow accounts, a criminal complaint says.

""The victims were not able to obtain refunds, despite numerous attempts by phone and e-mail,"" a Justice Department press release says. ""Victims whose surrogates were not paid by Blosser had to pay the surrogates directly, even though they had provided funds to Blosser for that purpose.""

An assistant federal public defender who represented Blosser at his initial court appearance Tuesday didn't immediately respond to a telephone call seeking comment Friday.

Blosser's victims include seven clients from Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Australia and Germany who collectively paid Blosser approximately $200,000, according to an FBI agent's affidavit.

""The allegations in this case are especially egregious because they involve someone taking advantage of individuals who are trying to become parents,"" U.S. Attorney Robert Hur, of the District of Maryland, said in a statement. ""Criminals who line their pockets through such heartless deceit will be held accountable.""

Blosser also faces civil lawsuits in Maryland and Florida, including complaints filed by the attorney general's offices in both states.

An investigation by Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody's office concluded that The Surrogacy Group and Blosser collected approximately $270,000 from clients for services they didn't render.

""The Surrogacy Group and (Blosser) portray themselves as trusted guides, but for many they have betrayed this trust by taking tens of thousands of dollars and then abruptly stopping services or providing no services at all,"" the Florida complaint says.

On April 22, a circuit court judge in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order barring Blosser from selling surrogacy-related services in the state, according to state Attorney General Brian Frosh's office.

The FBI has set up a webpage to identify and contact other clients who may have been defrauded by Blosser and The Surrogacy Group.

A federal magistrate judge ordered Blosser released on $100,000 bond after his detention hearing Friday, according to a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Miami.

Blosser, a resident of Tampa, is expected to make his initial court appearance in Maryland on May 17. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted of the wire fraud charge.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190503/florida-man-accused-of-bilking-clients-seeking-pregnancy-surrogates?rssfeed=true,2019-05-03T15:58:17Z,Daytona Beach News,Florida Man,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

Andrew Ross Celaius, 37, is charged with aggravated child abuse and tampering with evidence.

According to deputies, the victim's mother brought the 2-year-old girl to the hospital after she thought she had ringworm. It turns out, deputies say, that the ring marks were burn marks.

Deputies searched Celaius's home and found several disturbing videos that showed the abuse the girl had endured. Authorities say one video showed Celaius wearing a werewolf mask during the abuse. The most disturbing video, according to the sheriff's office, is a video showing the child wearing a dog shock collar and hearing the child scream when the collar was triggered.

Eric Furnans, 36, was also arrested and charged with tampering with evidence. Deputies say that Celaius called Furnans from jail and asked him to destroy potentially damaging evidence.

120,218,"Florida man accused of stealing cruiser, leads to chase on turnpike","OKEECHOBEE COUNTY, Fla. - A 22-year-old Largo man is accused of stealing a cruiser and leading Florida troopers on a chase.

The Florida Highway Patrol said Shane Jensen has been charged with stealing a patrol car and reckless driving.

Investigators said around 4 p.m. a trooper saw Jensen who appeared to be medically distressed, along the Florida Turnpike in Okeechobee County.

This was on the northbound shoulder at the 181st mile marker.

Troopers said Jensen was sitting on the grass shoulder next to the trooper's cruiser.

When the trooper went to get Jensen water, he got up and stole the cruiser, according to FHP.

Highway patrol said the suspect reversed the cruiser and accelerated toward three troopers in an attempt to run them over.

Investigators said Jensen drove into Osceola County.

Troopers responded by deploying stop sticks, according to investigators.

Jensen avoided the sticks and drove on the grass median and stopped against a guardrail, according to highway patrol.

Troopers said he exited the vehicle and ran into the woods.

He was arrested and transported to a local hospital for treatment.

No troopers or civilians were injured in the incident, according to highway patrol.

123,223,Florida man on death row for murdering cellmate indicted in death of another cellmate,"A man who has already been sentenced to death for killing an inmate in July 2012 was indicted Thursday on charges connected to the death of another inmate at the Santa Rosa County Jail in January 2017.

The State Attorney's Office announced Thursday that Rocky Ali Beamon, 41, was indicted by a Santa Rosa County grand jury on a charge of first-degree premeditated murder.

The charge stems from a Jan. 22, 2017, incident where Beamon allegedly killed his cellmate, 27-year-old Nicholas Anderson.

Prosecutors say shortly after the midnight inmate count, Beamon bound Anderson and strangled him in their cell. He also allegedly used a homemade weapon to cut the man's neck.

The charge carries a penalty of either death or life in prison. The State Attorney's Office will make a decision on whether to seek the death penalty in the case within the next 30 days, according to a news release. Prosecutors previously told the News Journal the state intended to seek the death sentence in the case if a grand jury indicted Beamon.

Beamon was sentenced to death in January for a separate incident where he killed his cellmate at Apalachee Correctional Institution in Sneads on July 5, 2012. In that incident, Beamon watched the victim, Bruce Hunsicker, for several days to learn his schedule, and then killed him by choking him and stabbing him 80 times in the shower area of the prison dormitory with a homemade shank.

Beamon then rinsed himself off and flushed the shank, a towel and a pair of boxers before proceeding to dinner.

Beamon had been serving, and is still serving, a life sentence for murder in a 2005 case in Hillsborough County.

129,237,Authorities: Florida man used shock collar to torture 2-year-old girl,"Pictures and videos were found of the man intentionally burning the young girl with a lighter, among other egregious acts.

An Escambia County man was arrested Wednesday under suspicion of using multiple methods of torture to abuse a 2-year-old girl, according to the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, faces multiple charges of aggravated child abuse, child abuse, tampering with evidence and several drug-related charges.

Authorities were alerted about possible abuse by doctors who identified burn marks around the girl’s neck. The toddler was taken to the hospital by her mother, who claimed her daughter had ringworm, the sheriff’s office said.

Investigators searched Celaius’ home and found videos and pictures of Celaius intentionally burning the young girl with a lighter, shooting her with an airsoft gun, hitting her with a bottle and scaring her with a werewolf mask.

However, it was a video displaying Celaius harming the girl with a shock collar — described as a tazing collar for dogs, that deputies found as most egregious, according to deputies.

Investigators also found videos of torture on cloud storage, and they are still looking into what the videos may have been used for.

The mother was also arrested for neglect, but was bonded out of jail. Deputies believe she was unaware of the extent of the abuse. She is fully cooperating with the investigation, according to deputies.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190503/authorities-florida-man-used-shock-collar-to-torture-2-year-old-girl?rssfeed=true,2019-05-03T08:15:40Z,The Ledger,Florida Man,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - A Florida man has been sentenced to a year in prison for his part in a reptile smuggling ring that stretched from South Carolina to Hong Kong.

The State reports Matthew Harrison Kail was sentenced Tuesday for the scheme that involved hiding rare turtles in candy wrappers or socks and shipping them overseas.

Prosecutors said Kail was a key part of the operation, which was led in South Carolina by Steven Verren Baker. Baker, of Georgia, was ordered in March to serve just over a year in prison. Authorities have said Baker's one of South Carolina's most well-known wildlife traders.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man has been convicted of leaving threatening voicemails for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Court records show that a federal jury in Orlando found 57-year-old Robert Francis Pratersch guilty Tuesday of threatening a federal official and interstate transmission of a threat to injure. He faces up to 15 years in prison at a July 16 sentencing.

Federal prosecutors say Pratersch left three profanity-laced, anti-Semitic voicemail messages last fall at Sanders’s office in Burlington, Vermont. Authorities say Pratersch threatened to behead Sanders, “ISIS-style,” and videotape the execution. The remark was a reference to the Islamic State militant group.

Pratersch was indicted by a federal grand jury in February and arrested later that month in St. Cloud, Florida.

ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA ) - A man who allegedly live-streamed a shootout between himself and Florida deputies, after having earlier dragged his wife from a car by her hair, asked a judge to drop all charges, saying the fracas was all part of a sexual adventure between he and his wife.

In a four-page letter to a judge in Orange County, 23-year-old Laforest Gray said he and his wife are adult entertainers with over 70,000 followers on Instagram.

ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA ) - A man who allegedly live-streamed a shootout between himself and Florida deputies, after having earlier dragged his wife from a car by her hair, asked a judge to drop all charges, saying the fracas was all part of a sexual adventure between he and his wife.

In a four-page letter to a judge in Orange County, 23-year-old Laforest Gray said he and his wife are adult entertainers with over 70,000 followers on Instagram.

The baby was born with the same disabilities as the teenager, according to the girl’s family. They said the teenager does not understand her relation to the baby.

Carlos Carrizales, 61, was sentenced Monday to life in prison. He was convicted last month of felonies including incest, Lakeland’s The Ledger reported. It was not immediately clear what Carrizales' relationship to the teen was.

The non-verbal teenager carried out the pregnancy and gave birth to her daughter in early 2017. Carrizales was arrested that November.

Investigators discovered the girl's pregnancy in 2016 and subsequent DNA testing led authorities to Carrizales. DNA tests showed he was 99.99 percent likely to be the baby's father. Assistant State Attorney Lauren Randall said two independent tests had the same result.

Jonathan William Chapman, 45, was under the influence of alcohol and refused to leave the library despite multiple requests from library staff that he go, according to the report.

When police arrived, Chapman gave them the name “Jason Bourne,” the titular character of Robert Ludlum’s best-selling book series, and a phony Social Security number, the report said.

Once police figured out Chapman’s actual identity, the 45-year-old man was taken into custody on a first-degree misdemeanor charge of resisting an officer without violence.

Kyle Rohrig is an avid hiker and his Shiba Inu named Katana usually accompanies him. She's easily logged 30 miles a day on their past trails, but when Japanese hunting dog lost both eyes to Glaucoma two months before the trek, he worried how she would fare on the trail.

Along with a friend, they headed north on the trail from Big Cypress near Miami in January and finished April 1 at Fort Pickens near Pensacola.

The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports Rohrig hoisted the 21-pound Katana onto his backpack when they approached deep swampy areas and treacherous spots. He estimates he carried her for more than 800 miles.

Last week, “in response to citizen requests, our deputies conducted a speed enforcement operation in Golden Gate Estates,” the Collier County Sheriff’s Office wrote on Facebook.

But after a steady stream of traffic, they were left confused. They’d only pulled over one driver for speeding.

When the deputies left the area, the community apparently not being the speed demons they’d been painted as, everything made sense.

A Florida Man tale: Florida man reported $18k income. Got almost $1 million refund. Now the IRS wants its money back

Another Florida Man tale: This Florida man is the greatest investor you've never heard of

Located about a quarter mile from the speed trap, sat a piece of plywood propped up against a 45 mph speed limit sign. “POLICE AHEAD” the sign warned in bright red paint.

What’s left for the Florida deputies to say but “Well played, Anonymous Sign Artist. Well played.” And that’s exactly what they did.

The Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) says that a Chrysler van was traveling westbound on Wickham Road, approaching two other vehicles who were stopped in the left lane for a family of sandhill cranes that were crossing the road.

The van is said to have swerved to the right to avoid the vehicles and then swerved back into the left lane when the driver noticed the sandhill cranes were in the road. The front of the van struck the rear of one vehicle, which was pushed into a third vehicle. The front of the van went on to also strike the front of the third vehicle.

A passenger in the van, a 100-year-old man, died at Holmes Regional hospital after this crash. We have not yet received his identity. Two others from the other two involved vehicles were injured as well. 63-year-old Brian Giantonio suffered serious injuries and 63-year-old Deliece White suffered minor injuries.

FHP is still investigating the crash.

He is also accused of locking the bedroom door and not letting his girlfriend leave. While he was moving the mattress around, deputies say the girlfriend was able to unlock the door, escape and call for help.

319,521,South Florida man arrested after fatally shooting neighbor during dog dispute,"Police say Ian Stefan fatally shot another man who confronted Stefan about walking his dog without a leash.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A South Florida man was arrested Thursday after fatally shooting his neighbor during a dispute about a dog, police said.

Ian Stefan, 26, of West Palm Beach, faces a charge of second-degree murder.

West Palm Beach police said Stefan shot and killed Slobodan Jakovljevic, 68, during a Feb. 5 argument at the Park Place Apartments.

According to a probable cause affidavit, Stefan was walking his dog through the complex without a leash when Jakovljevic confronted him about it.

""Stefan responded, but the response is unknown,"" which upset Jakovljevic, Detective Andrea Branch wrote in the affidavit.

Jakovljevic charged at Stefan with his fists clinched, at which time Stefan pulled out a gun and shot Jakovljevic in the chest, police said.

According to the affidavit, ""no words or physical altercation ensued as Jakovljevic was moving toward Stefan.""

Stefan then called 911.

""I was about to be attacked for not having my dog on a leash by a man I've had previous issues with,"" Stefan told the 911 dispatcher, police said.

Stefan went on to say that he was scared for his life when he pulled out his gun. Police said he had a permit to carry a concealed weapon.

When the 911 dispatcher asked Stefan if he shot somebody, Stefan replied, ""Yes, I did.""

But police said Stefan did not try to help Jakovljevic after the shooting, refusing to administer CPR.

""He's completely blooded out and he's not breathing anymore. I'm sorry,"" Stefan told the 911 dispatcher, police said.

Members of the homeowners association told police ""there were only a few issues"" between the men, involving Stefan's dog not being on a leash and Stefan not reporting guests to security.

""No board member interviewed during this investigation ever witnessed anything physical between Stefan and Jakovlevic,"" the affidavit said.

The investigation concluded that Stefan's actions were ""imminently dangerous and there is no reasonable explanation for him to have shot and killed Slobodan Jakovljevic over a strictly verbal dispute involving an unleashed dog,"" Branch wrote.

Mike Walton tells Tampa television station WFTS that he was stuck by a fish hook while fishing about 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast of Palm Harbor on Saturday. He later went to a hospital, where he received antibiotics for his hand, which had started swelling.

Walton says that by Easter Sunday, there were black bubbles growing on his injured hand. He was rushed to Tampa General Hospital where infectious disease doctors began treating him.

He says doctors considered amputating his arm, but were able to remove bacteria.

Walton said he's expected to be released from the hospital Thursday and will be on antibiotics for a month.

A Florida man said he is lucky to be alive after a minor prick from a fishing hook led to a life-threatening, flesh-eating bacterial infection.

Fisherman Mike Walton caught his hand in a fishing hook in the Gulf of Mexico days ago, and didn't think much of it, he told Tampa Bay's WFTS. It's an injury he said he's had hundreds of times while fishing.

But, his hand began to swell — with large black blisters. Usual antibiotics weren't working. So, Walton drove himself to an emergency room, where doctors told him he needed surgery or he might lose his arm or worse.

“They said in a few hours, this would have gone up my arm into my chest and I wouldn’t have been here. There was no saving me,” Walton told Florida's FOX 13.

Doctors considered amputating his arm, but were able to remove the bacteria from skin tissue between his elbow and the palm of his hand, he said.

""I got real lucky on this one,"" he told WFTS.

The flesh-eating infection, necrotizing fasciitis, is rare and can be deadly. Bacteria that causes it can enter the body through even small breaks in the skin and spreads quickly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Walton, who works in construction, said this injury won't stop him from fishing in the future.

""I want to go right now,"" he said. ""It ain't going to slow me down. It's one thing I enjoy.""

Doctors told Walton the infection is contained, he said, but he'll likely need to be on antibiotics for another month, and require additional weeks to heal.

392,623,South Florida man waits 2 years to receive title for purchased motorcycle,"<p>A South Florida man got the motor running on his new motorcycle and was all set to head out on the highway, but there's one big problem.</p>

<p>Ruben Mendez recently purchased a Honda Magna V-30 motorcycle that has just 14,000 miles on it.</p>

<p>""I've changed all the hoses on it, gave her a tune up, put a fairing, some extra spot lights and a couple of trunks in there,"" he said. ""All I need right now is some tires and a tag to get her on the road, and she's ready to go."" </p>

<p>Mendez told Local 10's Leave it to Layron team that he spotted the motorcycle at a neighbor's house and that neighbor eventually agreed to sell it to him.</p>

<p>Mendez said he began making monthly $50 payments on the motorcycle on Jan. 14, 2017, until the bike was paid for to the sum of $1,000, which was agreed upon by him and the seller.</p>

<p>""Every time I paid, I signed. He received, he signed,"" Mendez said. </p>

<p>Mendez took possession of the bike and said the seller moved out of the neighborhood, although he would still come by to receive payments.</p>

<p>Mendez said he took a motorcycle endorsement class and kept making his payments until last September when the final payment was due. </p>

<p>""My payment, my title, goodbye and we're done,"" he said. </p>

<p>But when it was time to hand over the title, Mendez said the seller ghosted him.</p>

<p>""No call, no show. The last address I went to, he doesn't live there,"" Mendez said. ""No emails, no voicemails, no texts -- no anything.""</p>

<p>Mendez said he has gone to numerous places to find out how he can aquire a tag for the motorcycle but has turned up empty-handed.</p>

<p>""Nobody could give me answers,"" he said. ""In fact, I went to a tag agency on Sheridan Street, and I explained to the man what was going on with me, and he just looked at me boldly and said, 'Well, I guess you have a bike you can't ride.' So that's when I got fed up and said, 'I got to make a phone call,' and you're the phone call.""</p>

<p>It's a good thing Mendez did keep his detailed ledger and contract.</p>

<p>The LITL team contacted the county tax collector's office, which said the ledger, the receipts, the signatures, the title and VIN could all be presented to a clerk of court.</p>

<p>A court order could then be issued, granting Mendez ownership of the bike. All he'd have to do from there is present that order to the DMV to get his title and tags.</p>

<p>""(I) just want to ride the bike, pop wheelies, cause all kinds of Hades and be free like a bird,"" Mendez said. ""That's all I want to do, is just ride.""</p>

Jimmy Dean Phillips, 42, was charged with possession of illegal narcotics Tuesday night.

At the time of the arrest, the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office Narcotics Unit was executing a search warrant at a residence in the 5400 block of Cherub Circle in Milton.

The home's resident, Jennifer Holly Campbell, 36, was arrested when deputies reportedly found meth, heroin, marijuana and Oxycodone pills in the house.

Deputies also reported finding drug paraphernalia such as multiple digital scales, plastic baggies and a notebook investigators believe contained prices for the narcotics.

While deputies were searching the home, Phillips reportedly walked up to two deputies in the yard — one with a badge around their neck and another in a Sheriff's Office vest.

Phillips told the deputies he was there to see Campbell, and the deputies searched him. According to the report, they found meth in his pocket and took him into custody.

According to jail records, Phillips is being held in Santa Rosa County Jail without bond. Campbell was released Wednesday on $7,500 bond.

454,698,Murderous Dino Bird Kills Florida Man,"Photo: Mark Baker (AP Photo)

Cassowaries are, in a few words, extremely fucked up. They are creatures that, like a great many that live either naturally or unnaturally in Florida, are categorically disinclined to coexist alongside both the past and current iterations of the human species, or any other species for that matter. They are a mix between emus, the cool-but-inaccurate velociraptors of Jurassic Park, and an extremely ornery Florida parent. They are also kings and queens that should be worshipped as the Cretaceous Period royal descendants they are.

A cassowary (it’s unclear what this particular one’s given name is) killed Marvin Hajos, a 75 year old Florida man who kept the enigmatic beast in a cage with another of the species, for “agricultural use.” The reported act of provocation and the violence that followed leading to an auction of the Murder Bird spurred a write-up in the New York Times on Wednesday. The Times did not provide the gory details of how, exactly, Murder Bird did the murder, save for the guilty party’s weapon of choice—a gotdang foot.

To be more specific, a foot like this:

You know what, I’m sorry. These feet are good and scary, yes. They are dinosaur-esque and unnerving and probably should not exist on the same space-time continuum as our big doughy, defenseless meat sacks of bodies haplessly waddling around the planet. Without context, these talons don’t seem much scarier than, say, an eagle’s, which are no doubt terrifying. But Murder Bird’s feet go far beyond anything the human mind can be prepared to comprehend.

Advertisement

Try this one on for scale, from a paleontologist, no less:

No, you are not looking at the foot of a velociraptor perfectly preserved in ice; this is the foot of a creature that is alive and breathing and thirsting for blood right now, at this very minute, somewhere in the world. It’s waiting, not-so-patiently, for an opportune moment to remind you, or whoever dares enters its consciousness, of the mistakes—and, more importantly, the lasting effects—of evolution. Marvin Hajos, god bless him, figuratively flew too close to this flightless beast on April 12 when he went into its cage to collect the dino eggs that this “bird” plops out. Murder Bird saw what Murder Bird sees. It saw a man. It saw its babies. It saw its claw. It saw 65 million years of instinct and training. In one fell swoop, the cassowary made a choice that had been made for it by Mother Nature eons earlier. On that day, a cassowary became Murder Bird, the protector of the realm, destroyer of men, heir to the earthly crown.

The razor-clawed cassowary is one of among 100 exotic animals from the departed owner's estate going up for auction.

Gulf Coast Livestock Auction said in a Facebook post the auction of the killer cassowary is in accordance with the last wishes of Marvin Hajos.

""One of Marvin’s wishes were his animals be sold at auction as soon as possible,"" the group said. ""This is an absolute auction and complete dispersal of his animal collection.""

The auction is to be held Saturday at noon and is billed as featuring ""rare, odd and unusual breeds."" Members of the news media, in addition to video recording devices, are banned from the event.

""Anyone seen video taping in any capacity will be deemed trespassing and will be escorted out by security,"" a post by the group reads. ""Your video equipment may or may not be confiscated until all video recordings are distroyed (sic). Please do not comprise (sic) our position.”

Gulf Coast Livestock Auction Manager Jammi Wilson told the Gainesville Sun the business has all the licenses to proceed with the auction.

“I don’t want to talk about it,” she reportedly told the paper before hanging up. “It’s really no one’s business.”

Alachua County Sheriff's officials said Hajos had fallen April 12 when the bird attacked him. First responders rushed Hajos to a hospital, but he died from his injuries.

“Initial information indicates that this was a tragic accident for Mr. Hajos and his family,” department spokesperson Lt. Brett Rhodenizer told the Gainesville Sun.

Cassowaries are similar to emus, standing up to 6 feet tall and weighing up to 130 pounds.

""The cassowary is rightfully considered the most dangerous bird in the world,"" according to the San Diego Zoo. ""Each 3-toed foot has a dagger-like claw on the inner toe that is up to 4 inches long! The cassowary can slice open any predator or potential threat with a single swift kick.""

The animals being auctioned include two double-wattled cassowaries and five ring-tailed and ruffled lemurs.

Fish and Wildlife spokesman Robert Klepper said buyers must be licensed to legally possess the animals.

648,974,Florida man is Best Buy's oldest employee,"Bob Kaufman, 89, said his favorite thing to do is to get to know his customers and build a relationship with them.

Fifteen years ago, Bob Kaufman was shopping at Best Buy on South Tamiami Trail in Sarasota with his wife when they noticed a kiosk promoting working for the company.

Kaufman, who was 74 at the time and retired, certainly had the relevant experience to get a job at the big-box electronics retailer. After all, he's been working on computers since 1958 — back when they were the size of tables and used punched cards for program creation and storage. Even still, Kaufman said he was unsure that Best Buy would hire an associate in their 70s.

""I said, 'Look, I'm 74 years old. They're not going to hire me, I'm too old.' And of course I was wrong,"" he said. His wife encouraged him to apply, and the rest is history.

Today, 15 years later, the Sarasota sales associate at the University Town Center store is the oldest employee in the entire company. On Sunday, April 7, he celebrated his 89th birthday.

Related: This Florida man is the greatest investor you've never heard of

Kaufman was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, and grew up in Newton, which is right outside of Boston. After serving stateside in the Air Force Reserves during the Korean War, he worked for a family business where he sold automotive accessories and other merchandise like toys, lawn and garden supplies and electronics in 35 stores across New England. He eventually went into data processing, where he did payrolls and installed computers.

Around the time he retired at age 62, he did work on the side with a data processing company he started with someone else. They processed surveys sent to companies in the printing industry. He's been in Sarasota for 25 years.

He thinks he probably wrote thousands of computer programs back in the day.

""Computers were the size of these desks,"" Kaufman said, gesturing to the rectangular folding table in the Best Buy break room where we were having our interview. ""I can still remember somebody telling me, 'You know, some day they're going to have a computer on a desk,' and I said, 'I'll believe it when I see it.' This was even before they had tape drives, before they had disk drives and all of that.""

At Best Buy, he originally worked in the appliance department at the store on South Tamiami Trail, selling things like refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers and microwaves. Back then, if you wanted to sell computers, you had to be able to lift them, which he wasn't able to do. But that has changed, and today, his colleagues are happy to help him with the physical tasks he can't do on his own.

He transferred to the University Town Center store seven years ago and went into the computing department. Theoretically, he said, he can sell anything in the store.

""Somebody will come in and I'll greet them, and they'll say, 'You sold me a refrigerator 12 years ago.' I'll say, 'How did you like it?' and they'll say, 'Oh, we love it,'"" he said.

Among his colleagues, Kaufman said he is just one of the guys.

""Employees love working with him. You would think some of these younger kids would not want to pick up the physical aspect of what he can't do, but they don't,"" General Manager Bobby Borges said. ""They really truly enjoy working with him because I think he sets the example for all the younger kids today.""

Kaufman generally works about 12 hours a week, but he's always looking to work more, Borges said. He's also curious about learning as much as he can about new products and other things — he knows how to say ""thank you"" in 26 languages.

""When you think of our line of work, it changes more than anybody else, in retail. Not only do we all have to stay on top of it, for a gentlemen who has other things going on in his life, he's still looking, he's still hungry,"" Borges said. ""He wants more info, he's always asking for anything he can get. That's a breath of fresh air for someone who is doing it because he wants to versus he has to.""

Kaufman said his greatest joy is getting to know the customers. Everybody who comes into the store has a story to tell. Whenever he meets someone new, he asks for their name and gets to know them. They're there to buy, and he's out to help them buy what fits their needs, rather than pushing them toward any specific product.

He said he's kind of amazed at the buzz his status as the company's oldest employee has generated. The day of our interview, a co-worker told him that a blog post from Best Buy about his status as the oldest employee was being shared around the internet.

The thing is, Kaufman said, he likes what he does. He could be sitting back at his house watching television, but he doesn't want to do that.

""When you're 89 years old, how many people are you going to meet and make friends with and learn about? This way I meet hundreds of people — I just enjoy it,"" he said. ""People come in and say 'What are you doing working at your age?' I say, 'This isn't work.' You get to talk to people, I get to share a bit of my knowledge. This is what I do for fun. The nice thing is getting paid. That doesn't hurt, but it's not my primary objective, obviously.""

752,1148,Florida man charged with attempted murder smiles in mugshot,"LAKE COUNTY, Fla. - A Florida man accused of opening fire on two men at a Lake County park smiled for his mugshot.

Tavares police said Channen Quashie, 29, of Eustis, was arrested Thursday night after an officer who was investigating a report of a stolen vehicle at the corner of Lake Avenue and Main Street heard what sounded like five gunshots coming from the area of Ingraham Park.

The officer went to where they thought the gun was fired and came across a white car with several bullet holes in the rear driver's side panel. The driver's side window was also shattered, according to a police report.

Police said the man who was sitting in the driver's seat when the shooting started told officers he saw Quashie pull up in a black SUV, roll down the front window and smile before firing the gun at the victim and his friends.

The victim said he exited the car and jumped on the ground to avoid getting hit, the report said.

A friend of the victim said he was standing outside the vehicle talking to the victim when Quashie pulled up and fired about three to four shots in his direction, police said. The friend said he was previously in the United States Army and felt as if he was ""still in Iraq"" when the shooting started, according to the report.

Police said they found a bullet casing in the middle of Ruby Street while processing the scene.

Lake County deputies and Eustis police officers, who had been given a description of the black SUV Quashie was believed to be in when the shooting happened, later found the vehicle in Eustis and took Quashie into custody on Glover Street, the report said.

Quashie was taken to the Lake County Jail and faces two felony counts of attempted murder and one count of discharging a firearm in public.

TAMARAC, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a Florida man left threatening rants about gun control, illegal immigration, homosexuals, black people and Muslims for three Democratic members of Congress.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office says 49-year-old John Kless was arrested Friday and charged with making threatening communications.

A federal criminal complaint says Kless called the Washington offices of Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey on Tuesday and left profanity-laden voicemails for each politician. The messages specifically mentioned the elected officials being killed. Swalwell and Booker are both running for president.

Investigators say they traced the phone number back to Kless, who lives in Tamarac, Florida. U.S. Capitol Police previously investigated Kless for a message left in February for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Jonathan Moist was arrested on a felony charge of video voyeurism of someone at least 19 years old.

According to the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, Moists' niece and her friend who were housesitting for Moist discovered the hidden camera in November.

""He had a hidden camera in his bathroom that videoed an adult female in the shower,"" said Brevard County sheriff's spokesman Tod Goodyear, who added that the victim is the friend of Moists' niece.

The niece and victim removed the device and took it to the girl's mother, who lives in Cocoa, according to the Sheriff's Office. A sheriff's report says they removed an SD card from the device, plugged it into a computer and observed several videos of people in Moists's bathroom, including some in the shower.

Officials said Moist provided conflicting information about when he placed the device in his bathroom and the purpose of putting it there. Authorities also said other videos were captured, viewed and deleted by Moist.

Moist was arrested and taken to the Brevard County Jail. He was released after posting bond.

815,1248,Florida man pretending to be cop pulls over undercover officer,"HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. - One Florida man learned the hard way that just because you want to be a cop doesn't mean you are a cop.

Matthew Joseph Erris of Dade City (not Miami-Dade County... whew!) was arrested Tuesday for impersonating a police officer, WFLA reports.

How he was caught is what makes this truly a #FloridaMan story.

On Tuesday evening, Erris turned on red and blue flashing lights on his SUV and pulled over a car. The car was being driven by an undercover detective.

Oops.

Knowing the traffic stop was odd, the detective called 911 and actual deputies showed up to take Erris into custody.

Police found a ""realistic looking"" airsoft pistol in Erris' SUV and had a law enforcement light bar installed in the vehicle.

Erris was arrested and released on bond while officials attempt to determine if he had committed similar moves with non-cops before.

830,1274,Florida man arrested for impersonating officer after pulling over undercover detective,"- A man was arrested for impersonating a law enforcement officer after he unknowingly pulled over an undercover detective.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office posted about the incident on Facebook.

They said that 26-year-old Matthew Joseph Erris decided to play cop, turning on his red and blue lights and pulling somebody over. However, he had no idea that the other driver was a real undercover Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office detective.

They went on to state that deputies then did a real traffic stop on Erris. They found an airsoft pistol under his passenger seat.

Erris is reportedly facing a charge for impersonating a law enforcement officer.

Deputies said that they are not sure how many times Erris has done this in the past. Anyone who recognizes his vehicle and believes they may have been a victim should contact the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office at 813-247-8200.

845,1299,Florida man busted for singing dirty song to neighbor,"WILDWOOD, Fla. - Perhaps next time one Florida man will stick to the classics when attempting to impress a woman with a song.

Robert Mirabella, 62, was arrested Saturday after he played guitar and sang an original song to a woman he was serenading.

What got him in trouble was that Mirabella was sitting on the woman's porch and the song contained words not normally found in friendlier tunes.

According to the arrest report, Mirabella's lyrics contained phrases such as ""There is a neighbor who was a bitch and I see her now, she’s just a witch.”

The Smoking Gun reports the woman claimed to have ongoing issues with her neighbors in The Villages, just north of Orlando.

For his part, Mirabella claimed that he may have sang the song in front of the woman, but it didn't mean it was about her.

Mirabella was arrested for disorderly conduct and plead not guilty.

The incident began around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday when someone reported that a motorcyclist had fired shots at a residence on Buick Avenue then fled the area, the report said.

Police said they saw Philip Spurlock, 23, speeding out of the area so they followed him at a safe distance.

Video from the Brevard County Sheriff's Office helicopter unit shows Spurlock driving in the area at speeds near 100 mph. Patrol units on the ground did not pursue Spurlock.

""He knows the helicopter's over him so let's just back off him and give him some room and see if he parks somewhere. There's no way we're gonna catch him and we have no option to stop him so let's give him as much room as we need to give him and let's see if he'll stop,"" a law enforcement officer says in the video.

At about 11:40 p.m., video shows Spurlock riding his motorcycle through the front yard of a home on Lillian Drive then hopping off the bike and running through the residential area.

Authorities said Spurlock jumped several fences before opting to hide behind an air conditioning unit. Officers surrounded him there and sicced K-9 Brutus on him, according to the affidavit.

Spurlock grabbed the dog by the neck and fought with it as an officer yelled, ""Let go of the dog,"" and ""Show me your hands,"" the report said.

Spurlock was arrested on charges of causing harm to a police animal, resisting arrest without violence and two counts of shooting a missile into a dwelling.

Jurors in Clearwater deliberated for about seven hours over two days before convicting 29-year-old John Jonchuck.

[PREVIOUS: Jurors weigh case of dad accused of tossing girl off Florida bridge | Florida man who dropped daughter off bridge claims insanity]

No one disputed that Jonchuck dropped his daughter Phoebe 62 feet into Tampa Bay in January 2015.

But prosecutors claimed Jonchuck's action was premeditated and that he acted out of anger against Phoebe's mother and his own mother. They said he knew what he was doing was wrong.

His defense attorney said during closing arguments that Jonchuck was insane, and delusions led him to believe Phoebe was possessed.
