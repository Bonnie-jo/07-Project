Palm Beach County sheriff's spokeswoman Therese Barbera said in a news release that Rafaelle Alessandra Carbalho Sousa was arrested late Thursday and will appear in court Friday. She's charged with attempted felony murder and child abuse.

Officials said two people heard the baby crying and found her in the trash bin Wednesday. She was taken to a hospital and is expected to be fine.

Investigators haven't said what led them to Sousa.

Under Florida law, newborns can be dropped off anonymously at a hospital or fire station with no questions asked.

A Florida woman was arrested after a second-grader in her care repeatedly showed up to school in clothes caked in filth and a backpack filled with ""hundreds"" of bugs, deputies in the Panhandle said.

The girl is one of five siblings ages 5 to 14 who lived in a ""filthy"" Milton home infested with roaches, soiled mattresses on the floor, piles of cat feces, no edible food, broken windows, and bags of trash throughout the home and yard, according to a Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office report.

Jessica Nicole Stevenson, 33, was arrested May 3 and charged with five felony counts of child neglect without great bodily harm.

Deputies said Stevenson's bedroom was ""abnormally"" clean compared with the condition of the rest of the home, with a flat-screen TV and bed linens. In contrast to the children's closets, hers was filled with clean clothes, according to the report.

The children's living conditions came to the attention of staff at Bagdad Elementary school, which three of the siblings attend, the probable cause affidavit said.

The second-grader told authorities she didn't know when her last bath or shower had been. School staffers said they'd repeatedly given the girl clean clothing to wear but that the child kept showing up dressed in the same outfits several days in a row as they became dirtier and dirtier.

A Florida Department of Children and Families report about the three siblings who attended the elementary school led to the sheriff’s office launching an investigation April 18, the Pensacola News Journal reported.

PUNTA GORDA — Sheriff's officials say a Florida woman pulled a small alligator from her yoga pants during a traffic stop.

The Charlotte County sheriff's deputy stopped a pickup truck Monday afternoon after it ran a stop sign and 22-year-old driver Michael Clemons told him he and his 25-year-old passenger Ariel Machan-Le Quire were collecting frogs and snakes under an overpass. He gave the deputy permission to search bags in the truck.

When the deputy found 41 3-stripe turtles in the woman's backpack, he asked if she had anything else. She pulled the 1-foot alligator from her yoga pants.

The Ocala Star-Banner reports school officials told officers Giddens' son had been suspended from the bus three days for an April 29 fight.

An officer went to Giddens' home and played her the recording of the message. An arrest report says Giddens told investigators she was frustrated with the school and the bus driver.

She was charged with making a threat to kill, do bodily injury or conduct a mass shooting.

She remains in jail. A lawyer isn't listed on records.

48,104,Florida woman's video captures rare 'positive' lightning bolt up to 10 times stronger,"Volleys of afternoon thunderstorms rocked South Florida the past several days, as punctual as the afternoon sea breeze and a harbinger of one of the state's most dangerous times of year.

The rainy season that doesn't officially begin until May 15 in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties, comes with the kind of life-threatening lightning, tornadoes and flooding that have highlighted the area's weather since Friday.

Underscoring the atmospheric mayhem was an unusual bolt of lightning up to 10 times stronger than a typical flash that was caught on video by Boynton Beach resident Erica Hite on Sunday.

>> RELATED: Why Florida's summer thunderstorms are unique, deadly

The so-called continuous current, or positive lighting, which was identified by the National Weather Service in Miami after seeing the video, hit outside Hite's apartment when she was taking video to show her family how bad the weather was.

The 12-second clip of the blinding strike that sounded like firecrackers going of was played on MSNBC's Morning Joe and repeatedly on The Weather Channel. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, positive lightning originates in the upper reaches of a cloud's anvil and make up less than 5 percent of all strikes.

""It was crazy. Very scary, very loud,"" Hite said. ""It was just the right place at the right time. I could probably never in my life get something like that again.""

Hite said the strike damaged a concrete dumpster enclosure.

Weather-related damage on Friday included the loss of half a horse stable roof in Loxahatchee when a weak tornado touched down. The EF-0 with 70-mph winds was confirmed by an NWS survey team. No people or animals were injured, according to the survey team.

And up to 300 lightning bolts as hot as the sun cracked the sky in West Palm Beach between 4 and 7 p.m. Sunday, leading to the cancellation of the Tears for Fears show at SunFest to the dismay and ire of fans. Country music star Keith Urban's flight was diverted from PBIA to Miami because of heavy rains, winds and lightning on Sunday, but somehow his band hit the stage just after 9 p.m.

>> BOOKMARK The Palm Beach Post's weather page for climate and environmental news

Meteorologist Larry Kelly said the Miami office of the NWS was in constant contact with SunFest or police officials to give them weather updates, but didn't make any decisions as far as far as asking people to seek shelter or canceling shows.

While Florida's unique sea breeze-initiated thunderstorms are the norm for summer as daytime heating lures in winds from both coasts, the recent storms also had an upper-level southwest flow that pushed them to pile up along the coast.

Rain totals Sunday were highest in Miami-Dade County, but areas in Boynton Beach and Jupiter received more than 2 inches, with Lake Worth getting 1.95 inches.

The official measure at Palm Beach International Airport was 0.91 inches.

>> RELATED: Date, not dew point, starts ""rainy season""

Miami's National Weather Service office decided last year to set standard rainy season dates beginning May 15 and ending Oct. 15. South Florida gets an average of 70 percent of its rain during the wet season.

""It's just like hurricane season starting June 1,"" Kelly said. ""Sometimes you get storms before.""

Before the dates became standard, the rainy season was determined by looking at dew point temperatures, sea surface temperatures and an established pattern of rainfall typical to the rainy season for at least three consecutive days.

The National Weather Service in Melbourne still does it the old fashioned way.

""We are getting to the point where everything switches to the afternoon thunderstorms and basically rain every day,"" said meteorologist Krizia Negron, who works in the Melbourne NWS office. ""We are getting close to it for sure.""

NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Pasco County woman is facing charges after deputies say she assaulted a man in an attempt to sober him up.

Pasco deputies were called a home on Hummingbird Lane in New Port Richey just before 1 a.m. Sunday and arrested 39-year-old Amber Lynnee Grace.

According to an arrest report, Grace slapped the victim in the face during an argument inside the home. The victim told deputies he then walked away from Grace and went to his bedroom.

Deputies say the victim later woke up and found Grace standing over him with a kitchen knife raised above her head. Grace then stabbed the bed with the knife, the arrest report says.

The victim told deputies he was scared he was going to be stabbed by Grace. A responding deputy noted in the arrest report that there was a slice in the bedsheets just inches away from the pillow where the victim's head was.

Donna Heiss tells one station that as she pulled into her garage on Thursday, her neighbors yelled for her to get inside. Once inside, she looked out the glass front door and saw a large alligator looking back at her.

The gator then stands up on its hind legs and peeks inside her home through the window like a Peeping Tom.

She says she was nervous that the gator ""was going to break the glass"" before the alligator trapper arrived. She took cellphone video of the gator pressing its nose against the glass and then walking around the house to find another way inside.

Alachua County Sheriff's officials say Kristy Lynn Phillips and her husband were arguing at home last week when he left in his truck. Authorities say she pulled into oncoming traffic to block his truck, pulled out a 9 mm handgun and fired several times. No one was injured.

According to an arrest report, Phillips was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and firing a weapon from a vehicle in the April 18 incident.

The Gainesville Sun reports Phillips told deputies she tried to see if the gun was loaded, and it jammed. She said she fired one or two shots before it jammed and she flung it out the window.

155,247,"Lab monkeys get second chance at life, thanks to Florida woman","- Kari Bagnall's Gainesville home has grown into a monkey paradise. The property has primates of all sorts, including marmosets, tamarins and capuchins.

""It's kind of like the rainforest out here, that they would live in naturally,"" she explained.

Kari's a mom of sorts to hundreds of rescued primates. Over half the monkeys at her Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary were brought in from research labs. They were involved in everything from nicotine and cocaine studies to research on vocal cords and cognitive functions.

She says some arrived in rough shape. ""A lot of time when they are in a lab or by themselves, they go mad, they go crazy and they start pulling out their hair.”

Now she gives them the retirement she believes they deserve, a life with all the creature comforts.

Continue reading below

""We want to give them a monkey life and introduce them to other monkeys and do monkey things,” she said.

Twenty-six young squirrel monkeys are her latest arrivals. Kari calls them the FDA Boys. They were part of a Food and Drug Administration nicotine study. It was abruptly cancelled after four monkeys died.

""I was happy that whole study was stopped,"" she offered.

They're adjusting to a far different life at the sanctuary, one where they're being groomed to roam on their own. ""They are still in their lab cages now because we are building for them. We roll them outside, so that they can get used to outside.""

Kari had an interior design career, but her goals shifted in 1992 after she adopted her first orphaned monkey, then another, then dozens more.

Now, her passion has grown to 20 employees and dozens of volunteers.

Some biomedical researchers argue ethically controlled studies on primates are still necessary. Still, primate labs at Harvard and the National Institutes of Health closed, either because of public uproar or alternatives to animal studies.

""Ultimately, I would like to see them out of research. I don't know that I'll see it in my lifetime, but that would be the best,” Kari continued.

Yet, the number of monkeys used in medical research jumped to an all-time high in 2018. ""Most are still being euthanized, but the trend is moving towards retirement, so we're really excited about that.”

197,298,Knock knock: Gator shows up on Florida woman's doorstep,"Living in Florida means making peace with a few realities – namely, hurricanes, election controversies and, of course, surprising encounters with the native wildlife. It comes with the territory.

But a Palm Coast woman’s recent run-in with an alligator was especially startling because she didn’t have to go far. The unwanted visitor just showed up at her door and wouldn’t take no for an answer.

According to ClickOrlando.com, the episode happened Thursday afternoon as Donna Heiss was getting home. She heard her neighbors warning her to get inside, and it didn’t take her long to figure out why.

Heiss posted two video clips of the encounter on Facebook, saying what all of us would be thinking if we found ourselves in a similar situation: ""Not cool.""

The gator, which measured about seven to eight feet long, can be seen in the video wandering around the porch, knocking on the glass door and even peering through a window at one point.

For Heiss, it was an encounter that was too close for comfort. She told ClickOrlando she was worried that the gator’s knocking might actually shatter the glass. ""It frightened me so much,"" she said.

An animal trapper was called to handle the reptile.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said gators that are four feet long and believed to pose a threat are considered nuisances. If you see a nuisance gator, call 866-392-4286.

This particular coral snake, known as the eastern coral snake, is among the six most dangerous snakes in Florida, which has 44 species. While its bite is serious and should receive immediate medical attention, fatalities are rare. Coral snakes generally do not bite and if they do, it is often a dry bite or they inject a very low volume of venom.

It's quite rare to see one in a housing area.

""We believe that with a lot of debris being cleared from the Hibiscus Road recently, this snake may have been forced out of its natural habitat. Live and let live.""

GAINESVILLE — When a Florida woman heard a noise and saw a man trying to break into her car early Sunday, she took matters into her own hands.

Clarese Gainey, 65, of Gainesville tells WGFL that she picked up her softball bat early Sunday, braced herself and eased open the door before hitting Antonio Mosley.

Mosely ran to a nearby mobile home park, leaving behind his pants, shirt, and a sock, police said. A K-9 unit tracked him down, and Gainey said she easily identified him because of the knot on his head.

Gainey says she played softball in high school and can still swing a bat.

The Alachua County Sheriff's Office said that they are offering a reward of $8,000 for any information that leads to the arrest of anyone responsible for the disappearance of 23-year-old Jasmine Robinson.

Jasmine was about six to seven months pregnant when she was last seen by family members on February 18th, 2019. She is still considered missing and endangered. The search for her remains active. She is also expected to give birth soon.

“Detectives have and continue to gather significant technical and forensic evidence,” said Lieutenant Brett Rhodenizer, Public Information Officer for the Sheriff’s Office. “We also know that there is key information that only certain people can provide, and this unique reward opportunity just may encourage them to do the right thing for Jasmine and her child. We know she left her home in Archer with someone, and there is someone who knows who that is.”

Tips received through CrimeStoppers are anonymous. Please contact 352-372-STOP, the CrimeStoppers website, or use the P3TIPS application to submit a tip.

This is the first time that the Alachua County Sheriff's Office, in partnership with the Florida Sheriff’s Association Criminal Apprehension Assistance Program and CrimeStoppers, has been able to offer a reward in a local missing person's case. Reward funding is authorized for payment when the information provided to law enforcement leads to an arrest. Criminal activity also must have kept Jasmine from returning home for the reward money to be available.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Video

A young Florida woman who traveled to Colorado and bought a shotgun for what authorities feared would be a Columbine-inspired attack just days ahead of the 20th anniversary was found dead Wednesday in an apparent suicide after a nearly 24-hour manhunt.

Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader said 18-year-old Sol Pais was discovered by the FBI with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The manhunt had led to the closing of Denver-area schools as a precaution.

During the manhunt, the FBI said Pais was “infatuated” with Columbine and made threats ahead of Saturday’s anniversary of the attack that killed 13 people at Columbine High School in 1999. The FBI described her “extremely dangerous.”

The Miami Beach high school student flew to Colorado on Monday night and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition, authorities said.

“We deal with a lot of threats at Columbine,” John McDonald, executive director of security for the Jefferson County school system, said when the manhunt was over. “This one felt different. It was different. It certainly got our attention.”

Agents had focused the search around the base of Mount Evans, a popular recreational area about 60 miles southwest of Denver.

All classes and extracurricular activities for about a half-million students were canceled as a precaution, though sheriff’s spokesman Mike Taplin said the young woman’s threats were general and not specific to any school.

Authorities said Pais was last seen not far from Columbine — in the Jefferson County foothills outside Denver — in a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots. Police were instructed to detain her for a mental health evaluation.

In Pais’ hometown of Surfside, Florida, Police Chief Julio Yero asked that the family be given “privacy and a little time to grieve.”

“This family contributed greatly to this investigation from the very onset. They provided valuable information that led us to Colorado and a lot of things that assisted in preventing maybe more loss of life,” he said.

Pais’ parents last saw her on Sunday and reported her missing to Florida authorities on Monday night, Surfside police said.

Because of the threats, Columbine and more than 20 other schools outside Denver locked their doors for nearly three hours Tuesday afternoon, and some canceled evening activities or moved them inside.

Adam Charni, a Miami Beach High School senior, said Pais dressed in black and kept mostly to herself. He said he was “baffled” to learn she was the person authorities in Colorado were searching for.

We didn't want to kill the coral snake because, being a native Florida resident, this was the first time having the opportunity to come up close and personal with such a beautiful creature.""

CLOSE The Sunshine State is home to 44 different types of snakes, but only six are considered dangerous. These have venomous bites that can harm humans, and should be avoided. Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

More: Bloodsucking worms in pythons are killing Florida snakes, study says

This particular coral snake, known as the eastern coral snake, is among the six most dangerous snakes in Florida, which has 44 species. While its bite is serious and should receive immediate medical attention, fatalities are rare. Coral snakes generally do not bite and if they do, it is often a dry bite or they inject a very low volume of venom.

It's quite rare to see one in a housing area.

""We believe that with a lot of debris being cleared from the Hibiscus Road recently, this snake may have been forced out of its natural habitat. Live and let live.""

396,619,Florida woman accused of pointing gun at victim after she wouldn't turn right at red light,"The suspect was charged with two counts of aggravated assault.

BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. - A 51-year-old Cocoa woman is accused of pointing a gun at another woman after the victim would not turn right at a red light, according to an arrest report from the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office.

Penny Herndon was charged with two counts of aggravated assault.

On March 2, the victim was driving west on Highway 50 in Titusville and stopped at a red light.

The victim was going to merge onto Interstate 95, according to the arrest report.

The woman told investigators she saw a black van stop behind her.

The driver of the van started to honk the horn despite the light still being red, according to the report.

The arrest report shows the victim was unable to merge onto Interstate 95.

The light eventually turned green and both drivers moved onto the on-ramp of the interstate.

The driver of the black van followed closely behind the victim, according to the report.

Investigators said the victim told the sheriff’s office she changed lanes to allow the black van to pass her.

The black van passed her and changed lanes to get in front of her, according to the report.

The report shows the victim had to hit the brakes so she would not hit the van.

The victim said the driver of the van changed lanes to be parallel with her.

The sheriff’s office said the victim told investigators the suspect held a gun and pointed it at the victim’s car.

This caused the victim to hit her brakes and the van drove away.

The victim told investigators the gun looked like a semiautomatic type pistol with a silver or gray barrel and black handle grip.

The man sitting in the passenger seat confirmed her story to investigators.

The victim was able to give the sheriff’s office the license plate description.

The car was registered to Jerry True.

True told investigators his stepdaughter Penny Herndon was driving the van earlier.

Investigators later met with Herndon about the victim’s accusation.

Deputies said Herndon told investigators she was involved in a road rage incident, but she denied having a handgun or owning any guns.

She did tell investigators she owns a couple of pellet guns, according to the arrest report.

True told investigators his stepdaughter keeps a silver pellet gun in the van and uses it to chase raccoons away from her cats, according to the arrest report.

The victim was able to identify Herndon as the person who pointed the gun at her during a photo lineup.

397,623,South Florida woman accused of threatening Columbine students,"SURFSIDE, Fla. - Authorities said Tuesday they are looking for an 18-year-old Surfside woman suspected of making threats against Columbine High School, just days before the 20th anniversary of a mass shooting that killed 13 people.

Clarese Gainey said she heard a noise outside her apartment and saw a man in his boxers tugging at her car door handle and knocking on the window, according to WGFL.

In response, Gainey hit the half-naked attacker in the head with her baseball bat, police said.

""I took that bat and hit him upside the head, like, 'Pi-yah!' he said, 'Ow!'"" Gainey said, describing the incident.

Mosely left behind his pants, shirt and a sock as he ran to a nearby mobile home park, and was later tracked down by a K-9 unit, according to police.

When police brought Mosely to Gainey for identification, she was able to identify him by his head injury.

Mosley is being charged with two counts of burglary and drug possession and is being held in the Alachua County Jail.

An arrest report from the Alachua County Sheriff's Office said that on Sunday morning, 36-year-old Antonio Mosley attempted a burglary at a home on NE 12th Avenue in Gainesville.

Mosley was described to be in his underwear and wearing no shirt while doing this. He reportedly weighs about 300 pounds. Gainey confronted Mosley, but he charged at her while she stood in the open doorway of her residence. She feared that he was trying to gain entry into her home and harm her.

So, according to the arrest report, Gainey used a baseball bat to strike Mosley on the left side of his head and told him to get away from her. Gainey fled into a neighboring mobile home park, leaving behind his jeans, shirt, and a sock.

A K-9 reportedly tracked Mosley down, but by this time, he was wearing pants. A baggie of cocaine was found in his pockets. Mosley told law enforcement that he does not remember what happened, but he did identify the clothing left at the scene as his.

570,899,Florida woman jumps off Daytona Beach Pier trying to save a drowning boy,"A mother on the beach screaming. A little boy bobbing in and out of rough waves, possibly drowning.

The sight terrified 19-year-old Hanna Pignato, so she jumped off the Daytona Beach Pier into the sea on Saturday evening to try to save the child.

""I was just thinking that could be my little sister I would hope someone would save,"" Pignato said with a deep sigh, lying in her hospital bed Sunday afternoon. ""So I jumped.""

Pignato, a surfer and swimmer, believed she could save the boy but as she fell into shallow waves she hit a sand bar.

""I wasn't thinking about the sand bar,"" she said. ""So I injured my back and broke my foot.""

The fall from the pier hurt Piganto's back and broke her right foot in three places, said her mother, Heather Pignato.

""She had surgery on her foot this morning,"" she said Sunday. ""I'm just glad she won't need surgery on her back.""

Hanna Pignato, a waitress who works on the rooftop of Joe's Crab Shack, told Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue officers that she jumped into the water to save the child shortly before 8 p.m., Ocean Rescue Capt. Tammy Malphurs said.

""An 8-year-old boy was caught in a rip north of the pier,"" Malphurs said, adding that the child was saved and taken to the hospital as a precaution.

""We also got a report of a woman, who appeared to be a Joe's Crab Shack employee, lying on the beach by the pier,"" she said. ""She advised us she jumped in to help save the boy.""

She said the agency discourages the public from attempting to rescue people and advised that it's better to call 9-1-1.

""We believe her heart is in the right place but we do not encourage people to try and rescue people drowning,"" Malphurs said.

Hanna Pignato said she just couldn't stand by as she watched the child's mother ""freaking out.""

""I didn't want the baby to die,"" she said, donning on the cap of her grandfather, a retired Volusia County sheriff's deputy who died last month. ""He wasn't a baby, he was 7 years old, 8 years old, but still I mean that's a human life you just can't look at that and walk away.""

Heather Pignato, who lives close to the beach, heard the sirens and headed out to see what was happening, not expecting to hear they were there for her daughter.

""I texted her and she didn't answer,"" the mother said. ""Then a friend from work called and said 'Don't worry Hanna is OK. A boy was drowning and she jumped in to save him.'""

Although her daughter was injured, she said she's proud of her because her intentions were good.

""She kept saying 'I'm sorry, don't be mad at me' and I said 'Hanna, you tried to save someone,'"" Heather Pignato said.

MELBOURNE, Fla. (WESH) - A Melbourne woman is accused of raping an elderly patient who lived in a care facility where she worked.

Officials with the Melbourne Police Department said Monday that they’ve arrested 39-year-old Guettie Belizaire.

Belizaire worked at the Brookshire Assisted Living Facility in Melbourne.

Last December, she was allegedly found naked in the room of a man who suffered from several medical conditions, including dementia.

Police said a sexual assault kit was lab tested and confirmed that a sexual assault had occurred.

Belizaire is charged with lewd and lascivious molestation of an elderly person and abuse of an elderly person.",http://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-woman-accused-of-raping-man-with-dementia-at-nursing-home/1917269557,2019-04-11T14:43:31Z,WFLA,Florida Woman,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
637,997,Florida woman rescues fawn after mother deer killed by car,"An Alachua County Fire Rescue employee on her way to work early Thursday found a fawn grieving next to its mother, which had been struck by a car and killed.

Kelly Dugger brought the days-old, less-than-5-pound fawn into ACFR headquarters in Gainesville, where there was ""no shortage of love"" for the little creature, Dugger said.

""(In the car), he just laid down in my lap. I wrapped him in the T-shirt and brought him in,"" Dugger told The Gainesville Sun on Friday. ""You could tell he was young because part of the umbilical cord was still there.

""And when he stood up, he was very wobbly, but whenever he got up, he could walk around. He was just a sweet little guy.""

Dugger found the fawn near County Road 225 about 8 a.m. But she noticed ""Momma"" first, she said.

""She was lying on the side of the road after being hit by a car. Looked like where she landed. There was car debris everywhere,"" she said, noting when she arrived the doe was still alive. ""I didn't even notice the fawn at first. He was in the grass about 15 feet away and bleating.""

Dugger said after the doe died, she picked up the fawn and hauled him to her office. Once they arrived, it didn't take long for the little guy to be named.

""Everyone was calling him 'Rescue' because of the fire rescue,"" Dugger said.

Dugger said she stopped to check on the doe because she has a passion for animals — and people.

She is an ambulance driver for ACFR and worked as a paramedic for 26 years.

Rescuing a fawn is an anomaly, she said, but she has previously picked up dogs injured by cars and taken them to the vet.

""If it was my dog or animal that was hit, I would want someone to pick it up,"" she said. ""I would not want it to lie on the side of the road and suffer. It's just not in me.""

Dugger's passion for helping animals — and getting the fawn fed — led to her not getting a goodbye from Rescue.

""I was going to get him some food, and when I was gone, (the office) called to say FWC was there to pick him up,"" she said.

She said she's just glad he's safe.

Karen Parker, a spokeswoman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said the fawn was picked up by FWC staff and taken to Gainesville-based Florida Wildlife Care, a private wildlife rehabilitation center where the fawn will be cared for and eventually let back into the wild.

Dugger said she would love to go visit Rescue in his new home before he gets released. She said it's important for rescuers like herself to verify lone fawns are abandoned before trying to rescue them.

""I knew the mom was deceased,"" she said. ""Many people just assume a fawn is abandoned if it's alone. The mom is usually around.""

On Facebook, ACFR praised Dugger's ""compassion for animals"" and said her actions are ""a direct reflection of Alachua County’s mission to enhance and care for the lives of those in our community.""

Alachua County spokesman Mark Sexton added: ""Kelly's action embodies our spirit of service. In this case, it was a four-legged member of the public.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190413/florida-woman-rescues-fawn-after-mother-deer-killed-by-car?rssfeed=true,2019-04-13T15:02:44Z,Daytona Beach News,Florida Woman,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
638,998,"Florida woman feels trapped in her own home, says hawk keeps attacking her","June Miller said she feels trapped inside her own home because a hawk won't stop attacking her and her dog.

Miller noticed the hawk's nest in December, on the second floor of her bay window and she believes there is possibly a family nestled in it.



""I can't go out my back door. I can't go out my front door. I can't even sit out (on) my driveway in my garage,"" she said. ""It is (a)huge nest. And he's being very aggressive. I can't run or move fast enough.""



Miller said the hawk swoops in to attack her dog and has nipped her three times in the head, leaving scars.

June's next door neighbor snapped pictures of the nest after News 6 was not allowed on the property of Pelican Bay Golf Community to see the hawk.



""I don't want to hurt the hawk but he attacked me. I mean, you know, can I use that? Stand your ground,"" she said.



Miller claimed the bird has also slammed into her windows while she's inside. She called the homeowners association, which said it can't do anything because hawks are federally protected. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission told her the same thing and to dress accordingly.

""Get a hard hat to protect my head, which is a little late now because I already got three scars,"" she quipped. ""I love animals. I just want the nest removed. If the babies are in it, take them with them. I just want help,"" she said.



The FWC told News 6 the homeowner needs to contact the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to get a permit approved in order to remove the nest.

News 6 alo called Pelican Bay Golf Community for comment, but was unable to contact the organization.

827,1299,"Florida woman, former candidate defends Joe Biden","- A Flagler County, Florida woman is defending former Vice President Joe Biden, after she says he hugged and kissed her at a campaign event in 2012.

Heather Beaven was running for Congress at the time and met Biden at a rally in St. Augustine.

“He gave me a great big bear hug,” she recalled. “After we spoke, he gave me another great big bear hug and gave me a kiss. I’ll never forget it.”

Beaven says she won’t forget it because it’s a good memory.

“I feel like I got a really special moment with the vice president. Two humans just connecting,” she explained.

In recent weeks, seven woman have come forward, saying they did not like Biden’s touchy-feely conduct.

Lucy Flores, a former candidate for Lt. Governor of Nevada, said she felt ‘invaded’ when Biden kissed the back of her head.

“I’m always trying to make a human connection,” Biden said in a video posted to his Twitter page Wednesday. “Social norms have begun to change. They’ve shifted and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. And I get it. I get it. I hear what they’re saying.”

845,1323,"Florida woman pulls gun on victim who asked her to stop feeding cats, police say","The suspect, Lisa Saunders, 55, of Orlando, has an arrest warrant for aggravated assault with a firearm.

ORLANDO, Fla. - An Orlando woman is accused of pulling a gun on a victim who asked her to stop feeding cats, according to an affidavit from the Orlando Police Department.

Police said officers were dispatched to the 2200 block of West South Street around 6:45 a.m. on March 30 for a report of a possible aggravated assault.

Investigators said when officers arrived at the scene, they made contact with the victim.

Authorities said the victim told police around 5:30 a.m. she noticed a silver Nissan Altima pulling over and watched a woman put cat food on the sidewalk of South Street.

The victim told police she told the woman to stop putting cat food out because it attracts sick cats.

Police said the victim told officers the woman opened the driver's door, pulled out a black handgun and said, ""Don't [expletive] with me.""

Investigators said the suspect got back in her car and drove away from the scene.

The victim told police she feared for her life.

The affidavit shows the victim informed officers the feeding of stray cats has been an issue for the past few months.

Orange County Animal Control has set up traps in the area to catch the sick cats.

Officers said the victim told police the suspect feeds the cats away from the traps.

Authorities said the victim recognized the suspect days later after she ordered a pizza from Domino's Pizza.

The victim told police the suspect delivered her the pizza she ordered.

Police said an officer asked a store manager if they have an employee who drives a silver Altima and puts cat food on the ground in the area.

The Domino's Pizza manager told police the suspect had been feeding stray cats in the city for the past two years, according to police.

The suspect, Lisa Saunders, 55, of Orlando, has an arrest warrant for aggravated assault with a firearm.

Gordon's house did not meet the standards to keep the monkey as a pet, according to investigators.

Investigators said the suspect got the animal from a wildlife dealer who did not have a permit to sell a rhesus macaque.

She was given a citation for illegal possession of class II wildlife.

887,1395,Florida woman makes 3 holes-in-one in 9 days,"BONITA SPRINGS, Fla. — Bonita Springs golfer Terry Wells had three of a kind in nine days.

The same kind.

She made three holes-in-one in that period in February on three of Bonita Bay Club's five golf courses.

""It was crazy,"" Wells, who turns 65 later this month, said Tuesday. ""This is nuts.""

That's exactly what some of Wells' family and friends thought, as the series of texts were sent out by the club announcing each of her holes-in-one, as well as her own personal texts.

""My kids were like, 'OK, Mom, we get it. Just stop it,'"" Wells said chuckling. ""Nobody would believe me.""

Her husband, Rodney, also a golfer, didn't have a choice. He was playing with her for two of the three aces, including the final one. And Terry surpassed him in the ace family record book. She'd had a hole-in-one at their home club in Canada, Mississauga Golf & Country Club, a few years earlier, giving her a total of four to his two.

""Now I'm ahead of him,"" she said with a laugh.

Wells, who plays three to four times a week during season, made her first ace on Saturday, Feb. 16 on the 107-yard No. 12 of the Bay Island Course. She made her second on No. 3 at the Sabal Course on Thursday, Feb. 21, and her third on Monday, Feb. 25 on No. 8 of the Marsh Course. The three came in a total of eight rounds.

""With 12,500-to-1 odds of making a single hole-in-one, getting three within nine days is truly an incredible feat,"" said E.J. McDonnell, Bonita Bay Club's director of golf, in a release.

A Bonita Bay Club member and Bonita Bay resident for 20 years, Wells said she's been taking lessons with teaching professional Justin Smith. Wells, who has a handicap index of 9.6, said she hasn't come close to a hole-in-one since then.

On the first one at Bay Island, Wells said she did not see the ball go in the hole.

""You have to fly it over the marsh and it's hard to hold that green there,"" she said. ""I hit my ball. I knew it was good. I got over there. I saw a ball just at the back (of the green). 'That must be my ball.' It wasn't my ball. 'Oh my gosh, I thought I hit a great shot, where's my ball?' Rod said 'Why don't you check the hole?' I did and there it was.""

Five days later, she was playing with a group of women, and they had a shotgun start, so her first hole of the day was the 103-yard No. 3. And her first swing. And her second hole-in-one. Again, Wells went to another ball on the green thinking it was hers and it wasn't.

""I couldn't believe it,"" she said. ""I was all excited. I pulled in the pro shop (to tell them) because they send out a text to all of the members.""

Wells' husband was playing somewhere else, but one of his playing partners got the text. He told Wells' husband that he wasn't going to like what it said.

""I started getting texts back,"" she said. ""People were telling me to get lost.""

Four days later, Wells was playing with her husband again in a group. The first three players came up short due to the wind on the 104-yard No. 8 on the Marsh Course, so Wells went back and got a 7-iron — she had used an 8-iron on the other two aces — and choked down on the club.

""That was my sweet shot,"" she said. ""It just felt so good. I did see that one go in. I was, like, nuts. I was in shock.""

The texts were sent out again.

""Fake news,"" Wells said was a popular response.

But it was real. As real as it gets.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190407/florida-woman-makes-3-holes-in-one-in-9-days?rssfeed=true,2019-04-07T08:12:01Z,Sarasota Herald,Florida Woman,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

Relatives say 84-year-old Lorene Virginia Collier of metro Tampa has been missing since March 5. That's when she left one brother's home in the Gadsden area to drive to the home of the other.

The family didn't initially realize she hadn't made it, so there was a delay of more than a day in reporting her missing. Glencoe Police Chief Alan Kelly says someone can cover a lot of ground in that amount of time.

The Gadsden Times reports relatives have looked for Collier and distributed fliers, and the state issued an alert.
