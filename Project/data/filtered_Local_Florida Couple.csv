10,24,Florida couple busted after posing as detectives to free 'partner' from jail,"DESOTO COUNTY, Fla. - A Florida duo was more Laurel & Hardy than Starsky & Hutch when they were caught posing as detectives to free their ""partner"" from jail.

Francine Olson and Brandon Reyes were arrested Tuesday after telling DeSoto County dispatchers that they were new detectives while the two attempted to gain access to the jail.

Olson and Reyes were trying to spring George Chanza from behind bars. Chanza had been arrested recently on an outstanding warrant.

Instead, the couple are now joining their ""partner"" in jail after they were arrested for False Personation of a Law Enforcement Officer.

437,723,Central Florida couple say solar panel did not save money on bill,"A Central Florida couple say they spent thousands on a solar water heater that was supposed to reduce the amount of electricity they use and lower their power bill, but that was not the case.

""It's been pretty frustrating,"" Ken Countess said.

Ken and Vicky Countess say they were promised they would save $90 a month on their power bill.

Instead, they say they got months of frustration and cold showers.

In July 2018, the couple bought a solar water heater with a 10-year warranty from Florida Energy Water and Air, according to a purchase agreement provided to News 6.

They paid more than $11,000 for a new panel, new tank and new controller.

""We had this solar system installed in July, with a promise of 30 percent or more savings per month on our power bill,"" Ken Countess said.

But as Ken Countess tracked his monthly bills, he found there was very little savings. In fact, in four of the past seven months his bill actually increased.

""We're averaging $1 a month savings,"" he said. ""At that rate, it'll take 900 years for it to break even.""

He said the system wasn't working.

""Every single morning the water is not hot enough for us to take a shower,"" Ken Countess said.

Most doctors agree the best temperature for showering is around 110 degrees, but pictures of the temperature gauge on numerous days show the water never got hot enough until they turned their electric water heater back on.

However, technicians came out on numerous occasions, and said the system was working properly, according to the couple.

""It's been frustrating and ridiculous that we spent so much money,"" Vicky Countess said.

""I'm at a loss to understand why we're not getting anywhere close to the savings we were promised,"" Ken Countess told News 6.

Attorney Steven Kramer said companies should stand behind their sales pitch.

""The idea should be under-promise and over-deliver,"" Kramer said. ""If you set expectations you can't follow through with, then you're going to have a lot of unhappy customers.""

Ken Countess put it this way.

""If your system is not working, just take it out. Give me our money back,"" he said.

Ken Countess says he tried for months to get his money back.

When News 6 got involved, the company agreed to refund the couple $11,682.42.

Jason Spinney is the director of operations for Florida Energy Water and Air.

""We make every effort to resolve all consumer concerns,"" Spinney wrote in an email to News 6. ""We have maintained an A-plus rating with the Better Business Bureau for over a decade with no unresolved complaints. I worked personally with the homeowner to come up with an amicable resolution and at this time the complaint is resolved to the homeowner’s satisfaction.""

If you are considering a solar system, as always, make sure the company is licensed and insured and ask beforehand what the resolution policy is if you were to have a problem.

TAMPA (WFLA) - A Florida couple said I do country style at Redneck Mud Park in what might be the most redneck wedding ever.

Jeremy Biddle and Ahrielle Biddle decided they did not want an ordinary wedding so they decided to have the ceremony during the Trucks Gone Wild event at the park.

Jeremy tells WFLA that they wanted the ceremony to be as fun as possible so they got married in the back of their friend's pickup truck and the bride even wore an all white bikini as opposed to your average wedding dress.

The backroad romance even included a dip in the mud after the couple said I do.

Jeremy tells us that their love is ""country boy love"" and he couldn't be happier.

Congratulations and yee-haw to the happy couple. If you would like to help donate to the couple's honeymoon you can do so on their GoFundMe page.",http://www.wfla.com/news/florida/punta-gorda-couple-shares-vows-at-redneck-mud-park/1894901026,2019-04-02T18:28:36Z,WFLA,Florida Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
483,799,Get away this summer in a floating house built by this Florida couple,"Florida real estate couple challenges traditional housing options by giving Florida homeowners oceanside views with their floating houses.

Tiny houses hit a wave of popularity with TV shows like Tiny House, Big Living, but for one Florida couple, they’re putting a Sunshine State twist on the trend by building petite houses that can float.



Warren and Cynthia Billings were recently featured on HGTV’s Tiny House Hunters and have built and sold four of their homes and have two more under construction.



The couple went viral with more than 47,000 hits on Facebook after sharing photos of the construction of their first bungalow -- and that’s how Floating Bungalows became a thing, Coastal Living reports.



Each of their homes is about 550 square feet with hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, flush toilets and an outdoor deck.





Interested in living the coastal life? You can purchase a tiny, floating home for around $225,000.



“We refused to compromise on style, luxury, and beauty,” the Billings recall on their website. “After some time, and lots of thought, it became clear what we were looking for -- the ability to live on the water; a small home with virtually no upkeep, and an affordable joyful lifestyle that could be sustained by working part-time.”

626,1049,Florida couple recounts cruise ship nightmare aboard Viking Sky,"Ken and Cindy Treadwell of Wellington had to be evacuated by helicopter from the crippled Viking Sky cruise ship in Norway Saturday after it experienced engine trouble.

WELLINGTON — When Ken and Cindy Treadwell booked their dream trip aboard the Viking Sky cruise ship, they never imagined they'd spend part of their vacation dangling in midair during a helicopter evacuation.

The Wellington residents were nearing the end of their scheduled 13-day vacation Saturday when the ship encountered engine trouble in an area known for rough, frigid waters.

The crew issued a mayday call, and more than half of the ship's 900 passengers later were airlifted by helicopter to safety, including the Treadwells.

""Everything was going smoothly for most of the trip, until Saturday,"" Ken Treadwell said.

They were in the ship's theater watching a movie when the lights began flickering, and then went out. When a nearby mini bar toppled over, throwing glass and china to the floor, they headed back to their rooms.

They got halfway there when the captain announced an emergency muster. The Treadwells reported to their muster station inside a restaurant on the second floor. Crews were handing out life jackets, Ken Treadwell said, when the ship listed violently and a wave of water blew out a door.

""The force of the North Sea, which was probably under 40 degrees at that point, blew into the restaurant and pushed everybody back — tables, chairs, people,"" he said. ""We were soaked above our ankles. I talked to people later who had gone under water. They thought they were going to drown from the distance to where the door was to where we were. That was when you could see the shock and panic on everybody's face at that point.""

The Treadwells and about 400 other passengers were moved to the theater. The captain updated them regularly while they were there, and they were told that helicopters would evacuate the passengers 20 at a time.

The Treadwells were selected for helicopter evacuation, and began a four-hour trip up the stairwell to get to the seventh deck.

As they waited to be hoisted up into the helicopter, the ship listed again and the Treadwells were thrown against a wall.

""A squall came up, and it was sleeting sideways in our faces,"" said Ken Treadwell, an attorney.

The Treadwells eventually were evacuated with about 15 other passengers. They were taken to a soccer practice facility in a remote town on the Norwegian coast, where they were met by members of the Norwegian military and the Red Cross.

""They were wonderful,"" Cindy Treadwell said.

The passengers were bused to a hotel in the town of Kristiansand — about an hour away — and spent part of Sunday at a shopping mall.

""Viking gave us 2,500 Norwegian Krone — about $300 — to spend to get some clothes, because when we got off the ship we had no passport, no ID and no money,"" Ken Treadwell said. ""Just the clothes on our backs.""

They returned to the hotel, and later Sunday were bused back to the ship, which had been towed to the nearby port of Molde along with the remaining passengers and crew. They packed their belongings, spent the night onboard and took a charter flight to Oslo the next day. They returned to Fort Lauderdale later Monday, and arrived home around 1 a.m. Tuesday.

Ken Treadwell said he and Cindy, who have three children and five grandchildren, woke up Tuesday a little shaky and stunned by what happened on the Viking Sky, but also grateful. The WiFi stayed up while they were in the theater waiting to be evacuated, and Ken Treadwell was able to connect with fellow volunteers at CROS Ministries' food pantry in Lake Worth.

""We know we had a few prayer chains going there with us,"" Ken Treadwell said. ""I think while we were going through the ordeal, that had an impact."" The Treadwells' church, St. Peter's United Methodist in Wellington, mentioned the couple during Sunday services.

The Treadwells credit the Viking Sky crew for remaining professional throughout the ordeal and keeping everyone calm. The chairman of Viking also visited passengers at their hotel in Norway to apologize for the ordeal and to offer a full refund for the cruise — which the Treadwells say cost about $18,000 — as well as a complimentary future cruise on Viking Sky.

Ken Treadwell said he and Cindy, a retired public health nurse, probably will go back on Viking Sky, but with a different itinerary.

""I will not go to the North Sea again,"" he said.

739,1224,"Florida couple leaves 1 of 8 children behind at park, don't report toddler missing until next day, deputies say","Passersby found the 2-year-old girl ""wandering alone"" at a park just before sunset Friday, deputies said. Her parents didn't report her missing until the following afternoon.

A Florida couple left one of their eight children behind at a park after a family outing Friday night and didn't report the toddler missing until nearly noon Saturday, deputies said.

Jolanda Larose Alexandre and Makenson Alexandre, 34, told the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office they didn't realize they'd left the 2-year-old girl behind.

Passersby found the child ""wandering alone"" at Haverhill Park on Friday evening just before sunset, deputies said.

When deputies were called, they spent about three hours trying to find the girl’s caregivers, including making loudspeaker announcements and bringing in search and rescue dogs, the sheriff's office said.

The department had no idea whom the girl belonged to until the Alexandres called authorities the next day, deputies said.

The Alexandres were arrested and charged with child neglect, and officials with the Florida Department of Children and Families also removed the remaining seven children from the home, deputies said.

The girl had been left behind at about 7 p.m. Friday and was missing for more than 14 hours, according to the sheriff's office.

At about 8 a.m. Saturday, the sheriff's office posted a photo of the girl, who turns 3 this Thursday, asking ""Does anyone know who this little beautiful baby girl belongs to?"" with a ""heartbroken"" emoji on Facebook.

""We were dumbfounded. We were so upset,"" PBSO Public Information Officer Teri Barbera said, adding that the girl was in ""great condition,"" dressed nicely in a pink “Adorable” T-shirt and white tutu, and otherwise seemed to be generally well cared-for.

Jolanda Alexandre told authorities she had taken all the kids to the park to let them play for about an hour after picking Makenson up from work, then told them to get back into the minivan before she drove home and let them continue playing outside their apartment, according to a probable cause affidavit released Monday morning.

Jolanda Alexandre said she thought the little girl was with all the other kids but that on Saturday morning after she woke up, she and Makenson realized at about 9 a.m. that the toddler was missing, according to the affidavit.

Frantically searching for the girl, the mother was ""crying and shaking"" as she asked authorites for help and said she couldn't believe this happened, the affidavit said. Both parents said they usually check on all the children before bed but had not on Friday night, the document states.",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190325/florida-couple-leaves-1-of-8-children-behind-at-park-dont-report-toddler-missing-until-next-day-deputies-say?rssfeed=true,2019-03-25T09:43:30Z,News Chief,Florida Couple,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881
