3,13,Judge orders 3-year-old Florida boy to undergo chemo,"TAMPA, Fla. - Court-ordered chemotherapy treatment will resume Thursday for a 3-year-old boy who is battling cancer, WTSP-TV reported.

A Hillsborough County judge on Wednesday ordered the parents of Noah McAdams to provide him with chemo treatment, which is expected to last 28 days.

According to Florida law, the state can mandate medical treatment for a child in a life-or-death situation.

Doctors diagnosed McAdams with leukemia last month. He has been through one round of chemotherapy at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital.

His parents believed the chemotherapy would do more harm than good, so they took him to Kentucky to look for alternative treatments. They wanted to use CBD oil, fresh foods, Alkaline water and other measures to treat him.

The Florida Department of Children and Families put Noah in the custody of his grandparents.

The judge heard from three doctors and decided chemotherapy was the best option.

546,897,"Florida boy, 12, fights for his life: 'It's a prayer. It's a wish.'","Noah McKnight of DeFuniak Springs awaits a new heart at UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville.

DEFUNIAK SPRINGS — A 12-year-old fights for his life at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital in Gainesville.

Born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a congenital defect to the left side of the heart that hinders blood circulation, Noah McKnight has spent more than 200 days at the hospital awaiting a heart transplant.

His father, Andrew McKnight, said although Noah has underwent three open-heart surgeries in the past, his heart can’t sufficiently support him as he continues to grow.

“It’s a waiting game,” Andrew said. “It’s God's choice when he’s going to fulfill that. It’s a prayer. It’s a wish. It’s hope. It’s faith. It’s very emotional.”

Andrew said he moved to DeFuniak Springs from Pennsylvania with his five children in 2015. His hope was to give them a life away from the big city.

Four years ago Noah was diagnosed with bronchial casts, large obstructions within the lungs, Andrew said. Things have continued to go downhill in the last two years, he added.

After being scheduled for surgery in Pennsylvania to have the casts removed, Andrew said they traveled to Gainesville last May to have a cardiac catheterization to see if Noah’s heart was healthy enough for surgery.

It wasn’t, and the two have been at the hospital’s pediatric center since.

“There’s no other options for Noah,” Andrew said. “Noah needs to have a heart. There’s no other surgeries, no nothing that can help him gain life more than what he has already.”

In the meantime, Andrew said his oldest son, 21-year-old Nathan, has stepped up and is looking after the rest of the McKnight crew in DeFuniak Springs.

Since Noah was admitted into the hospital, Andrew said a friend of the family started a GoFundMe account to help them stay on their feet.

“It’s been a hard ride as a single parent and just being separated from the kids,” said Andrew, who added those waiting for a transplant normally only have a few-hours notice before being admitted into surgery.

“He’s only got half a heart, but he’s got more heart than most people I know,” he said.

652,1047,"Best Buy employees turn into ‘Dino Doctors,' help Florida boy with broken toy","0 Best Buy employees turn into ‘Dino Doctors,' help Florida boy with broken toy

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Two Best Buy employees went above and beyond to help a little boy from Florida.

Jordan’s best friend is his dinosaur toy. His mom, Niah Negron, said that her 3-year-old son takes the dinosaur, which he got for Christmas, everywhere. He either is holding it in his hand or it is stuffed in his shirt, ABC News reported.

But the dino lost his head last month and Jordan was heartbroken.

TRENDING NOW:

Negron was able to get the identical toy online at Best Buy and picked it up the same day. But like most kids, Negron said Jordan wouldn’t accept a replacement, he would only accept his “baby.”

So when the mother and son went to the store, she told the employees what had happened.

“We are here for a very delicate matter,” Negron said she told the workers. “You see, we need a dinosaur doctor as the head has broken off of our baby dinosaur.”

Luckily the workers played along.

Tina and Stephanie rushed the baby dino to “surgery,” but in reality, were swapping out the broken toy with a new one, ABC News reported.

As they got the new toy out of the package, they told Jordan, “Just a few more stitches.”

“They pulled off this elaborate hoax with bright smiles and quick action,” Negron wrote on Facebook.

Tina said she didn’t know how big of a deal it was when the “surgery” happened. “But when he saw the dinosaur his whole demeanor changed -- his face lit up so much. We made that little boy’s day.”

If the dino gets broken again, the “dinosaur doctors” have a plan. Stephanie pulled and bought the only other matching dinosaur so they have an emergency backup.

News of the impromptu dinosaur doctors got back to the Best Buy home office, and they were officially promoted to “Dinosaur Doctor” and it’s now documented on their badges, ABC News reported.

The dedicated youth, from Winter Springs near Orlando, dashed his latest mile Wednesday with the help of a fully-geared local police officer and an officer trailing in a police cruiser. Supportive neighbors cheered him on as he completed the feat.

Zechariah’s father, Chad Cartledge, says his son has been running in honor of every officer lost in 2018 and 2019 since January 12.

Zechariah lives thousands of miles away from his latest honored fallen officer, Sgt. Steve Hinkle. Hinkle was slain after being struck by a bullet last weekend in East Tennessee.

The youngster, who starts off each run with a prayer, has recently captured the attention of Florida Gov. Rick DeSantis. Zechariah was awarded the state's first-ever ""Back the Blue Award"" Tuesday for his efforts.

Today, I announced the new Back the Blue campaign to highlight brave law enforcement officers and Floridians who back them. I am excited to present the first Back the Blue Award to 10-year-old Zechariah Cartledge!https://t.co/WjyaN68ztYpic.twitter.com/Fl8aLFgF5K

681,1099,Civil rights complaint filed after Florida boy arrested in Pledge dispute,"LAKELAND, Fla. - A civil rights complaint has been filed on behalf of a Florida sixth-grader who was arrested after his refusal to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance triggered a confrontation.

Tampa attorney Roderick Ford filed the complaint Monday with the U.S. Department of Education.

The Ledger reports the complaint says the 11-year-old's civil rights were violated by a ""reprisal"" for exercising his constitutional right not to say the pledge Feb. 4 at Lawton Chiles Middle Academy. It also says the school resource officer unlawfully arrested and committed battery on a child, and the school subjected him to racial discrimination.

Lakeland police said the student was disruptive and made threats after a substitute teacher ordered him to stand.

Polk County School District attorney Wes Bridges said he hadn't yet seen the complaint.

781,1273,11-year-old Florida boy arrested for confrontation after refusal to stand for Pledge,"The Lawton Chiles Middle Academy sixth-grader allegedly told a substitute teacher that “the flag is racist and the national anthem is offensive to black people.”

LAKELAND — An 11-year-old Lawton Chiles Middle Academy student was arrested Feb. 4 and charged with disrupting a school function and resisting arrest without violence following a confrontation with school officials and a law enforcement officer.

The incident happened after his refusal to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and his refusal to stand after ordered by the substitute teacher.

Polk County Public Schools spokesman Kyle Kennedy said the sixth-grader “was arrested after becoming disruptive and refusing to follow repeated instructions by school staff and law enforcement.”

Kennedy said he wanted to make it clear that the student was not arrested for refusing to participate in the pledge.

“Students are not required to participate in the Pledge of Allegiance,” Kennedy said.

Gary Gross, a spokesman for the Lakeland Police Department, said he could not legally comment because the case involved a minor charged with a misdemeanor.

According to a report on Bay News 9, the student allegedly told a substitute teacher that he didn't want to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, that “the flag is racist and the national anthem is offensive to black people.”

District officials said the teacher's name is Ana Alvarez. Kennedy said she was not aware of district policy regarding the pledge as voluntary.

She allegedly told the student, ""Why if it was so bad here he did not go to another place to live?""

Dhakira Talbot, the boy's mother, told Bay News 9 that the teacher's actions were inappropriate and that her son should not have been suspended.

""She was wrong. She was way out of place,"" Talbot said. ""If she felt like there was an issue with my son not standing for the flag, she should've resolved that in a way different manner than she did.""

Kennedy said he could not discuss the student's discipline. He said Alvarez will no longer serve as a substitute in Polk County Public Schools and that they will be reviewing their training policy with the outside agency that handles hiring substitute teachers.

“Our HR department will contact Kelly Services, which provides our substitutes, to further refine how our substitutes are trained,” Kennedy said.
