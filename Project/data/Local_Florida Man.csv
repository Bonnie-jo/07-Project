8,Police: Florida man says he shot wife over 'disrespect',"PLANTATION, Fla. - A 73-year-old man shot his wife in the face this week inside their Plantation home, then walked to a neighbor's house and confessed that he'd killed her, authorities said.

Plantation police investigators said Fernando De Baere told them he shot Marisa Sherman, 47, because she wouldn't stop speaking disrespectfully.

Plantation police said De Baere shot her in the face, returned his .38-caliber handgun to a bedroom and then walked to a neighbor’s house to confess. The neighbor called 911.

Police said De Baere admitted to shooting his wife ""one or two times"" in the face while standing about 3 feet away from her.

De Baere was charged with murder and jailed without bond Saturday. Records did not show if he has an attorney.

Police say De Baere told them he shot his wife because he did not like the way she was talking to him during an argument. A police report says De Baere told officers exactly where to find the weapon.

27,Florida man who stood on sunroof while driving accused of felony domestic violence,"POLK COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA ) - A driver made a lot of people laugh this week when he stood up on his sunroof with his car on cruise control while driving on Interstate 4. But the story behind the story isn't funny at all.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office said 70-year-old Leonard Olsen was arrested not only for driving recklessly, but also for false imprisonment and domestic violence by strangulation.

RELATED: Florida man arrested for hanging out sunroof while driving on I-4

According to an arrest report, Olsen is accused of choking a 69-year-old woman on April 30 after she took too long to come to bed. The woman told deputies she had bruises on her throat and a hoarse voice.

Days later, after the woman came home from dinner, he allegedly ripped up the dress she had been wearing, accused her of having an affair and called her a vulgar name. Then he asked her for one of her bras and threatened to destroy every bra in her dresser. When she eventually gave him a bra, he tore it apart and demanded that she give him the pair of underwear she had been wearing. When she told him she was still wearing the underwear, he began ""pulling on the underwear causing the victim's body to shake back and forth until the underwear came loose from the victim's body,"" an arrest report states.

Once he was through destroying all of her clothing, Olsen began blaring music so she couldn't fall asleep. This lasted several hours, according to the victim.

The next day, the victim awoke to Olsen slamming dresser drawers, turning the lights on and off, and blaring music. Deputies said he pushed her onto their bed, straddled her and put his hand on her throat, then placed his thumb on her mouth, which she bit. Olsen got off of her and blocked the doorway to prevent her from leaving the room. After a few minutes, he let her pass through the doorway and she called 911.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office said detectives made contact with Olsen by phone on Tuesday and he agreed to turn himself in.

As deputies were on their way to meet him, they learned he had been pulled over by the Florida Highway Patrol for driving recklessly.

Olsen was arrested and booked into the South County Jail, where he faces three counts of felony domestic battery on a person 65 or older, one count of felony false imprisonment and one count of felony domestic battery by strangulation.",http://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/lakeland-man-who-stood-on-sunroof-while-driving-accused-of-felony-domestic-violence/1997065259,2019-05-12T03:59:05Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

She said her middle school daughter was followed home from school on Thursday and approached by a man in a car with a camera.

That student and her family spoke exclusively with WESH 2's Kelsi Thorud about what they said was a situation that could have ended much differently.

""It's just shocking because if I didn't do (anything), if I didn't run or anything, he probably would have gotten out of the car and probably grabbed me,"" the young girl said.

The sixth-grade student, who does not wish to be identified by WESH 2 News, said she was walking home from Freedom Middle School Thursday afternoon when she noticed a man in a black car.

""He's like, old looking, and he has a camera in his hand and he's smiling at me and telling, with his finger, telling me to come here,"" she said.

The girl said she immediately felt uncomfortable, so she started running.

""I run and he's still following me, and when he's still following me, I'm about over there, and I'm running and crying and screaming, 'Help me,' so someone could come and stuff,"" the child said.

Part of it was caught on surveillance video from the apartment complex the girl lives in.

In the video, the child is seen running to the gate, and a black car is seen pulling in right behind her.

""I could sense my daughter was scared by the way she was running. I've never seen her run like that before,"" the girl's mother said.

The girl's mother said she truly believes the man in the car wanted to take her daughter.

""It's a parent's worst nightmare to see something like that, and to know that there's people out there watching children like that, to try to take them or do whatever they want to do with them,"" she said.

The family said they've filed a police report and now they just want to warn parents in the area.

""Talk to your kids. Let them know stuff like this can happen. You may not think it can or will, but it does happen,"" the child's mother said.

Investigators say Celauis filmed himself torturing the child. They say he placed a dog collar on the girl and shocked her awake at night. Then he stood over her wearing a werewolf mask.

Investigators say the mother didn't know about the abuse. It was discovered when she brought the girl to the hospital for treatment of ringworm, which turned out to be burns.

42,No charges for Florida man with obscene sticker on car,"LAKE CITY, Fla. - Charges have been dropped against a Florida man who refused to remove what a deputy considered an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

The State Attorney's Office in Columbia County filed court documents Thursday saying it won't prosecute Dillon Shane Webb, 23, who had been charged with obscenity and resisting an officer without violence. The filing said a valid defense could be raised under the First Amendment, which protects free speech.

An arrest report said a deputy stopped Webb in Lake City on Sunday because of a sexually explicit sticker. The deputy cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court.

Officials said the deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused. The deputy then charged Webb with resisting.

ORLANDO, Fla. (WESH) — A TV show about the Sunshine State’s most outrageous crimes is in the works.

Oxygen is developing a true crime series centered around the state’s “most outrageous, notorious and craftiest killers.”

“When the murder is so bizarre, the motive so far-fetched and the crime so outlandish that it sounds like something from a Hollywood screenplay—there’s a good chance it was actually committed by a “Florida Man,” a description of the series on Oxygen’s website reads.

The show, according to Oxygen, will unravel the strange twists and turns of Florida crimes and try to reason how and why Florida killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension.

The show will be called “Florida Man.” It will be produced by Blumhouse Television.

51,Florida Panhandle man runs voice-over business from home,"PACE — What does a retired naval flight officer and former Navy Choir director do after serving his country? Join a barbershop singing group? Check. Sit in his patio and enjoy a nice Irish whiskey in the evening? Check. How about voice-over recordings from a walk-in closet in his bedroom? Still doing that.

John Harnish, owner of Harnish Voice Overs LLC, has spent the past nine years recording his voice in his Pace home's closet studio.

He admits that his recording space — among his shirts, slacks and shoes — is a bit unusual.

""I like it in here,"" Harnish admits of his closet/recording studio. ""It has great acoustics and the clothes and pillows in here help with the sound quality.""

Harnish said his first experience making money with his voice was at the University of West Florida in the early 1970s. He would record radio announcements for WCOA-AM while he finished his degree in communication arts. After graduation Harnish began his military career.

After retiring from the Navy, Harnish returned to Milton with his wife Jan and settled down. One day after a church service, a member of the congregation asked him if he had ever done voice-over recordings. The parishioner who had asked also owned a casting service, paving the way to Harnish's next career.

""I don't know if it's a career or more of a hobby,"" Harnish says.

His first love is singing. He is a member of the Pensacola Bay Harmonizers, a barbershop harmony-singing group as described on their Facebook page.

Harnish has many voice-over credits. Most of them are ""short-form jobs,"" which are 16- to 30-second commercials or political ads that can pay anywhere from $200 to $400 an hour. Short-form jobs typically take Harnish about 30 minutes to complete but it depends on the project. The pay also depends on whether the project is a Screen Actor Guild (SAG) union job or a non-union job. A SAG job has standard rates for each type of job and pays more than non-union projects.

Long-form jobs can last for hours and pay less. Harnish has a one-hour documentary to his credit that he did for Iraqi television through a United Kingdom company called Whisper Audio. For this job, they wanted an English voice-over for the entire documentary so viewers could have their choice of languages. It took 12 hours of work to complete one hour of finished documentary work. That job paid $900 for the entire project.

The third market that Harnish concentrates on is audio books. He has six to his credit so far.

""It takes anywhere from four to eight hours for one hour of completed audio book recording,"" Harnish said. ""Then you have to figure out how you want to charge it.""

Harnish said he can take a lump sum hourly wage of a few hundred dollars or receive royalties that pay in perpetuity, meaning he receives a check as long as the recording continues to sell. Up to 50 percent of the purchase price is paid back in royalties, Harnish said.

Harnish says he could make a very good living from voice-overs if he put all his time into the work.

""I still love singing. When I give that up I may devote more time to the voice-overs,"" Harnish says with a grin.

Then he leans over and whispers in a different voice, ""He will never stop singing,"" and chuckles.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190511/florida-panhandle-man-runs-voice-over-business-from-home?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T16:20:22Z,Daytona Beach News,Florida Man,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
52,"Not-so-fantastic 4 of Florida men wore makeup, wigs for jewelry store robberies","MIAMI — Four felons from Broward County have been convicted in federal court of jewelry store robberies from South Florida to Georgia that sound like scenes out of a Tyler Perry movie.

Christopher Brinson, Adrian Hardy, Emmory Moore and Jerome Simmons chose attire for each robbery’s gunmen that was less “Going in Style” than “Madea Goes to Jail.” They didn’t wear dresses, but did don wigs, slapped on makeup and wore women’s clothes, such as pink jumpsuits.

Alas, the four veterans of the Florida Department of Corrections proved no more skilled than they were stylish.

When they left one robbery, Moore left behind his cellphone, which was not only connected to a phone number on his account, but had the jewelry store’s name and number listed among the contacts. Brinson’s phone contained a photo of three of them next to a silver minivan rented and used in one of the robberies — a silver minivan with a SunPass that made the vehicle easily trackable.

While skedaddling from the last heist, they dropped a bag with over $1 million of jewelry.

The Justice Department used the Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative, which led to an armed robber getting 92 years and a man getting 32 years for over 20 armed robberies, to make federal cases out of the interstate run of robberies.

According to the criminal complaints, on March 3, 2017, Brinson walked into Class Jewelers located at 3756 W. Hillsboro Blvd. in Deerfield Beach and asked about selling a ring. Not long after Brinson’s visit, at around 2 p.m., surveillance cameras spotted two men dressed as women with long, dark wigs come in and rob the store at gunpoint. Employees didn’t identify the robbers dressed as women, but did easily identify advance scout Brinson.

The same thing happened March 16, 2017, at Lilli’s Jewelry Store in Spring Hill, an area north of Tampa. But as the two men-dressed-as-women left with $10,000 of jewelry and hopped in a silver minivan, Moore left behind his cell phone.

That whoopsy allowed cops to see text messages to and from Moore discussing “licks,” current slang for money quickly acquired by robbery; an internet history that included searches for Lilli’s and “jewelry store robbery in Hillsboro” (criminals tend to like to see what the media has to say about their crimes).

On April 1, two men and a woman, “all three … wearing long, dark-colored wigs, long-sleeved dark-colored shirts and long, dark-colored pants” and “light makeup” hit Bishops Jewelers in Valdosta, Georgia. Before the robbery, a man called the store to ask if the male employee was there yet. He was told the male employee would be there in an hour. A similar call preceded the robbery at Lilli’s.

Moore was arrested on April 6, 2017, for being a felon in possession of a firearm while, an arrest report says, he drove around in an unregistered car with illegally dark tints on the windows while smoking marijuana.

Hardy, Simmons and Brinson showed up at LSO Jewelry and Repair in Port St. Lucie at 9:05 a.m. April 13, 2017, “wearing heavy facial makeup and women’s clothing.”

Hardy: “dark-colored pants, a dark, long-sleeved top with a bright multi-colored shirt underneath, sunglasses, and long, dark-haired wig.

Simmons: “a women’s pink jumpsuit with a dark-colored wig.”

Brinson: “green pants, a light blue, long-sleeved top and a dark-colored wig.”

Perhaps the most eye-catching part of their ensembles, at least to the LSO employees: “Each also wore black gloves and brandished a firearm.”

When an LSO employee identified as “L.O.” asked Simmons if she could help him, Simmons said in a masculine voice, “I’m looking for an engagement ring.”

Hardy and Brinson locked the front door, then Hardy and Simmons marched L.O. and co-worker “N.N.” to the backroom at gunpoint. While they lay on their stomachs with faces down, the three criminals took what they wanted from the safe and display cases. An outside man told them through a walkie-talkie they were “good on time.”

Simmons relieved L.O. of a silver diamond and ruby Rolex. Then, suddenly, the inside trio wasn’t good on time. An off-duty cop saw the three enter the store and seemingly lock the door behind them. That was enough to prompt a 911 call.

A front door departure was aborted upon sight of approaching police, so the threesome ran out the back, “dropping a large bag containing nearly a million dollars’ worth of jewelry. The only item of jewelry removed from the store was the Rolex watch.”

Simmons was arrested after crawling out of some bushes, wearing only “boxers, socks, makeup on his face, and carrying a walkie-talkie in his hand.”

Hardy ran toward Martin Health System Diagnostic Services emergency room and hopped into a nearby box truck. The truck’s owner approached Hardy to find out why a badly made up guy was treating his truck like a cab.

“The owner of the truck told law enforcement that Hardy immediately exited the truck and left behind a wig, gloves, and sunglasses,” the complaint said.

Police hadn’t found Hardy when a call came in around 12:06 p.m. from a man worried that his pal, J.K., hadn’t been home at the pickup time for their golf game. And, the friend said, J.K. didn’t miss pickup time for a golf game.

Law enforcement found nobody inside at J.K.’s home. A trip through the house found drops of blood on the floor, an unopened gallon of milk on the counter, cell phones and two women’s purses.

Cops were still there when J.K. returned with another chapter to the story.

J.K., from Toronto, Canada, said Hardy, still on the run from police, had two guns and forced J.K., J.K.’s wife, their son and their son’s girlfriend to drive him to Broward County. Hardy had them exit at Sunrise Boulevard and drop him off at Tony’s Market, 800 NW 22nd Rd.

Brinson eventually was arrested April 20 on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Hardy was taken into custody May 8, 2017 after a traffic stop in Orlando.

Each of the four went down on charges of Hobbs Act robbery (affecting interstate or foreign business), conspiracy to commit a Hobbs Act robbery and brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime. Hardy got an extra four counts of kidnapping.

They’re scheduled to be sentenced June 7.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190511/not-so-fantastic-4-of-florida-men-wore-makeup-wigs-for-jewelry-store-robberies?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T16:10:28Z,Daytona Beach News,Florida Man,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

66,Charges dropped against Florida man arrested for 'obscene' sticker,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Charges have been dropped against a Lake City man who was arrested for having a window sticker on the rear window of his truck that deputies with the Columbia County Sheriff's Office said violated Florida's obscenity law.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said. Webb was released on a $2,500 bond.

In a filing from the State Attorney's Office, prosecutors told the court the charges were being dropped against Webb.

The Bonderud Law Firm of Jacksonville, which is representing Webb, released the following statement on Facebook, which includes the the filing from the State Attorney's Office:

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court, the report said. The deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused.

Webb said he wasn't even of the state's obscenity law, but after reviewing it since his arrest, he said it needs to be changed.

The billboard along State Road 535 reads, “Dear Walt Disney World Executives and HR, experienced EA/PA Professional seeking position as a WDW Assistant.""

It also provides his phone number and an email address, not to mention a hashtag to stay on par with these social times.

So how much did the billboard résumé set Fox back? ""I don’t want to say that because I don’t want my wife to divorce me. It’s worth it,"" he told WKMG.

And it kind of worked. A spokesperson for Walt Disney World released the following statement: ""We appreciate the creativity and encourage anyone interested in a role with us to apply at disneycareers.com.”

Fox isn’t the only Florida man using a billboard to get his message across.

The wacky, weird and wild world of Florida Man is getting its own show.

Oxygen Media, which announced in 2017 a full-time shift to true crime-related television, revealed Tuesday that a series based on ""America's most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State,"" has been added to the channel's projects.

There is no start date for the show, however, the series will be developed by Blumhouse Productions and Man vs. Robot. Blumhouse, founded by Jason Blum, an Academy Award nominee and Emmy Award winner, is known for producing low-budget horror films ""Get Out,"" ""The Purge"" and ""Insidious.""

A description of the show reads: ""When the murder is so bizarre, the motive so far-fetched and the crime so outlandish that it sounds like something from a Hollywood screenplay, there’s a good chance it was actually committed by a ‘Florida Man.’ ""

Yep. Sounds about right.

Other true crime shows in development at Oxygen include “The DNA of Murder;” “The Lover’s Lane Murders;” “Exploited;” “Framed by the Killer;” and “The Jane Doe Murders.”

The true-crime channel in 2018 was the fastest growing network in basic cable for the second consecutive year, according to Oxygen.

In March, users on social media got a kick out of Googling ""Florida Man"" with their birthday, which generated a Florida Man story that occurred on or near that day.

For example, Googling ""Florida Man September 14,"" which is Gov. Ron DeSantis' birthday — by default he's Florida Man because he leads the Sunshine State — this wacky story is generated: ""Shirtless Florida man is back to take on Hurricane Florence because the internet made it so.""

74,A Florida Man television series will happen this year,"Oxygen will pick up a television series based on Florida Man crime.

Florida’s most notorious will make it to Oxygen, the crime-focused cable television network, The Hollywood Reporter stated.

Since rebranding in 2017, Oxygen has created original content focusing on true crime. When it comes to Florida Man, Blumhouse TV will produce a series that focuses on “the most outrageous, notorious and craftiest killers from the Sunshine State.”

The Hollywood Reporter adds: “When a crime sounds like it came straight from a Hollywood screenplay, there's a good chance it was committed by a Florida Man.”

Oxygen’s Executive Vice President of Original Programming and Development, Rod Aissa, told the Hollywood Reporter, ""This year we’ve increased our original hours by more than 30 percent, and we'll keep ramping up our programming efforts as more fans flock to the network to experience best-in-class content.""

So, which Florida Man stories might be featured on the true crime-themed doc series? We don’t know for sure, but based on reports, the series will focus on murders and not the silly antics many love.

A Florida radio station is in the news again thanks to a controversial contest.

For the second year in a row, Fort Myers's 103.9 is giving away a round of in vitro fertilization for a couple struggling with infertility.

The man behind the giveaway, host Jason “Big Mama” Jones told Fox 4 News last year that he and his wife came up with the idea after turning to IVF.

""I know the struggle so I know it was going to change someone's life,"" said Sara Jones, Big Mama's wife.

“And we realized one in eight people struggle with infertility and we said, ‘Hey, let’s make a miracle happen,'"" Big Mama added.

The radio station has partnered with IVFMD in Naples and S.M.P. pharmacies to make the contest happen.

Those who would like to enter the contest must submit a four-minute video on the station's website.

“Tell us your story, tell the world why you want to be a parents,” said Big Mama. “You have to go to B1039.com right now and get ready. Upload your video this Monday.""

76,"Drunken boater crashes into navigation light in Florida Keys, officials say","KEY WEST, Fla. - A Key West man was arrested Friday after authorities said he was drunk and crashed his boat into a navigation light off the coast of Fleming Key.

Two of his passengers were hurt in the collision and a third was thrown overboard and was later recovered, the U.S. Coast said.

Kevin Scott Lancaster, 50, faces charges of boating under the influence and causing property damage.

The Coast Guard said Lancaster’s 20-foot center console boat collided with the Garrison Bight Channel Light No. 3 around 8 p.m. Friday. Coast Guard personnel took Lancaster’s vessel to shore. His five other passengers were not hurt.

Lancaster was cited by the Coast Guard for boating under the influence, gross negligence and having an inadequate number of life jackets. Agents with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission took him into custody.

Paramedics airlifted the people who were hurt to a local hospital. Their conditions were not disclosed.

""Boating under the influence is just as deadly as driving under the influence,"" said Petty Officer 1st Class Ryan Andzelik, a Coast Guard Sector Key West watchstander.

79,Jury finds Florida man guilty in alleged sleepwalking homicide,"A 12-person jury found Randy Herman Jr., 26, guilty of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston in March 25, 2017.

After about five hours of deliberations, a 12-person jury found Randy Herman Jr. guilty of first-degree murder this week in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston in 2017, rejecting the defense that he was sleepwalking when he attacked her in suburban West Palm Beach.

After the verdict was read Wednesday, both Preston’s family and Herman’s family teared up silently on opposite sides of the courtroom as Circuit Judge John Kastrenakes thanked the jury for its service of more than a week in the case. Before the judge sentenced Herman, 26, to the mandatory term of life in prison, Preston’s sister, Jordan, spoke briefly before the court.

As she tried to stifle her tears, she explained nothing has been the same since her sister was killed. The sisters and Herman had know each other since they were teenagers and lived together for more than six months at the home where she was attacked. Jordan Preston was not in the residence at the time of the fatal stabbing.

“The last few years without her have been awful. Our lives are totally different,” she said.

Outside the courtroom, Preston’s father, John, walked surrounded by more than a dozen family members and friends who came down from Pennsylvania for the trial.

“There’s no winners in this whole situation. Everybody’s losers,” he said.

Herman and his lawyers had argued he was sleepwalking when he stabbed Preston more than 20 times on the morning of March 25, 2017, and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors told the jury Herman’s actions were deliberate and not the product of an alleged sleepwalking episode.

Investigators said Preston had finished packing up and was ready to move to New York when Herman sent her a text message, asking her to pick up a shirt before she left to give to a friend. When Herman testified last week, he said he thought Preston had come back to the house that morning, he had given her a shirt, then they had hugged goodbye, she left and he went back to sleep.

“The next thing (I know), I’m standing over top of her and I have a knife in my hand, covered in blood,” Herman said. “I was confused. Scared. Didn’t know what to do. Didn’t know what happened.”

Herman then drove to a nearby park, called 911 and told them that even though he didn’t remember what had happened, he said he must have been the one that killed Preston because no one else was home.

Over the course of the trial, which began with testimony April 30, the jury heard from Palm Beach County sheriff’s detectives; Herman; Jordan Preston; Kyle McGregor, the man who last saw Preston alive; as well as from experts who testified both for against the sleepwalking defense.

In his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant Public Defender Joseph Walsh said there was no logical answer to what happened. There was no motive, no history of violence and no issues between Herman and Preston.

“There is no other rational explanation for this killing other than this could have been sleepwalking,” Walsh said.

Dr. Charles Patrick Ewing, a forensic psychologist, testified Monday that he was “truly puzzled” by the case until he learned of Herman’s history of sleepwalking.

“That really made sense to me, because I really couldn’t make any other sense of the case,” Ewing said.

He said while sleepwalking is uncommon and sleepwalking homicides are even less likely, they do happen and Herman met the criteria: The person attacked was well-loved by the attacker, there appeared to be no motive in the case, Herman said he couldn’t remember anything from the attack and he had a history of sleepwalking.

Herman’s mother, Kathi Adams, testified that she had witnessed several episodes as Herman was a child, but Jordan Preston said in the years she had known him and lived with him, she never saw him sleepwalk.

On Tuesday, prosecutors had Dr. Wade C. Myers, a forensic psychiatrist, testify and say that there’s no way Herman could have slept through the 20-plus stabs he inflicted on Preston because it was too complex of an action.

Instead, he suggested the motive in the killing may be sexually based, drawing from an alleged incident the night before the stabbing where Herman reportedly hid in Brooke Preston’s closet naked after a day of drinking heavily. No one saw the alleged incident and it was only known because Preston reportedly told McGregor and asked to spend the night with him.

Preston’s sister testified that there was no sexual or romantic interested between herself, her sister or Herman.

Over the years, there have been several high-profile murder cases where those accused have claimed sleepwalking as a defense for their actions and have had their juries rule both for and against them.

In 2015, Joseph Mitchell was found not guilty of strangling his 4-year-old son to death after his attorneys argued he was sleepwalking at the time of the attack in North Carolina. In 1999, an Arizona man was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his wife after he claimed he was sleepwalking when he stabbed her and then dragged her to the pool and held her head under water.

During his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant State Attorney Reid Scott said Herman was not sleepwalking and that he knew what he was doing.

“This is skin, this is bone, this is muscle (he’s stabbing,)” he said. “You’re not going to sleepwalk through that.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/zz/news/20190510/jury-finds-florida-man-guilty-in-alleged-sleepwalking-homicide?rssfeed=true,2019-05-10T04:20:00Z,Sarasota Herald,Florida Man,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

84,Here Is Trump Loving a Florida Man's 'Joke' About Murdering Immigrants,"Screenshot: The Guardian

President Donald Trump appeared before a raucous crowd of supporters for another one of his MAGA rallies in Panama City Beach, FL, on Wednesday. There, he joined the audience in laughing at an impromptu suggestion from the crowd: what if the U.S. just murdered undocumented immigrants?



“When you have 15,000 people marching up, and you have hundreds and hundreds of people, and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great,” Trump said. “And don’t forget, we don’t let them and we can’t let them use weapons. We can’t. Other countries do. We can’t. I would never do that. But how do you stop these people?”

At that point an as-of-yet unidentified member of the audience shouted “Shoot them!” Trump simply chuckled along with the crowd, noting, “That’s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement.” Good lord.",https://splinternews.com/here-is-trump-loving-a-florida-mans-joke-about-murderin-1834635814,2019-05-09T12:28:00Z,Splinter,Florida Man,"8551 NW 30th Terrace, Doral, FL 33122",FL,33122

Investigators in South Florida are looking for a man who dumped a bag of kittens next to a restaurant dumpster in Palm Beach County last week.“Three little kittens all balled up, all wet and stuck together,” said Mel Pfirman, a cook.Mel Pfirman is the cook at the Cup and Saucer Café at the corner of Lantana and Jog roads.“I came out to dump the grease and thought I heard something, little mauling, crying sound,” said Pfirman.He didn’t think anything of it, until he noticed a brown paper bag between the two dumpsters. “It was folded over so I looked at it because it looked odd, when I was standing there I heard something again, looked like the bag kind of moved, so I walked over and grabbed it, and felt weight it in, so I opened it up,” said Pfirman.Inside, three scared kittens.“Animal abandonment is a crime in the state of Florida, and this is a situation that we would prosecute someone for, so we need to know who they are and put the rest of the pieces of the puzzle together. But there is no excuse for leaving animals in bag next to a dumpster, this was a brown paper bag balled up, they couldn’t escape, they couldn’t fend for themselves,"" said Capt. David Walesky, with Animal Care and Control.Officials say the suspect was driving a newer model, white Audi. He faces three counts of abandoning an animal if caught. ""We are treating them for parasites, they were a little dehydrated when they were first found so we are working through those issues, and in a matter of a few weeks, they will be able to be spayed and neutered and hopefully they will find them homes from there pretty quickly,” said Walesky.Once they are healthy enough, they will be given back to the pet store, next to the restaurant, which helped care for them.

88,Florida dog dragging suspect in custody,"- A man accused of dragging a pit bull behind his truck in Spring Hill is now in custody.

Gregory Tousignant, 58, was arrested on Wednesday night, according to jail records.

Deputies in Hernando County say Tousignant, a transient, is the man who dragged a 1-year-old dog behind his moving truck before the animal slipped out of his collar.

""He came loose and flew into the median at which point he was rescued,"" wrote Jan Harwood, owner of Nature Coast Animal Wellness & Surgical Center, who witnessed it.

The dog, now named Ollie, was rushed to the vet clinic where he has been recovering from severe road rashes on his body as well as bloody paws.

“He’s doing really well, he doesn’t have any broken bones or internal injuries,” Harwood said.

Michael Terry, a spokesman for the Hernando Sheriff’s Office, says this doesn’t appear to be intentional because the dog was standing in the bed of the truck before jumping. A rope was tied to his collar.

“[Witnesses] saw the dog jump out of the truck as he was traveling down the road, and they actually tried to stop him. [Tousignant] didn’t hear him,” Terry said.

It is illegal in Florida to carry a pet in the bed of a truck that is not properly secured.

Tousignant faces an animal cruelty charge which carries a $1,000 bond.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/florida-dog-dragging-suspect-in-custody,2019-05-09T09:38:08Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

93,"Florida man arrested, refused to remove bumper sticker from vehicle","LAKE CITY, Fla. - A Lake City man who was jailed after refusing to remove what authorities called an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window said Tuesday that he is fighting the charges and will defend his constitutional right to free speech.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said.

Webb told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit against the sheriff's office.

""I'm tired of police forces thinking they are above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,"" Webb said.

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

Wedd said the deputy seemed angry from the start of the traffic stop.

""Like the whole time, he was just really rude,"" Webb told the AP. ""It just felt to me like his goal was to get me in jail.""

The deputy said he asked Webb how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words, and Webb said that ""it would be up to the parent.""

Webb told the AP that he didn't imagine the sticker doing any serious damage to children.

""I've had parents drive by me with their kids taking pictures,"" Webb said. ""They point and laugh and giggle, and they go on about their day.""

Webb said he had the sticker on his truck for less than a week before his traffic stop. He said he and several friends had all decided to get similar stickers as a group joke.

""I guess this cop just didn't find it funny, and he just thought he has to put me in jail,"" Webb said.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court, the report said. The deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused.

""I said I'm not removing any letters on my sticker because that's in violation of my First Amendment rights as a tax-paying citizen,"" Webb said.

The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail. Webb was released an hour later on $2,500 bond.

Webb's vehicle had been towed when he was arrested. He said the sticker was still in place when he retrieved the vehicle.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida released a statement Tuesday questioning why the sheriff's office was wasting resources on such a traffic stop.

""Shouldn't police officers spend their time serving and protecting communities and not pulling Floridians over for speech that is already protected by the First Amendment?"" ACLU spokeswoman Casey Bruce-White said in a statement. ""Using the excuse that a child would see and ask questions about this particular bumper sticker is absurd.""

The sheriff's office told the AP that deputy had probable cause of a violation of criminal law and took action. ""If the law is faulty then the legislature can address that or if the law is unconstitutional then the judiciary will address it, Sgt. Murray Smith said, adding that the defendant will have his day in court.

Webb said he wasn't even aware of the state's obscenity law, but after reviewing it since his arrest, he said it needs to be changed. He acknowledged that his sticker could be considered vulgar by some, but the law doesn't really define what that is.

""What's vulgar to me might not be vulgar to somebody else,"" Webb said.

LAKE CITY, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a Florida man was jailed after refusing to remove an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

A Columbia County Sheriff's Office report says 23-year-old Dillon Shane Webb was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence.

It says a deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite. The sticker said ""I eat a--,"" according to the Lake City Reporter.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court.

98,Florida man arrested over vulgar sticker on truck,"After being given a notice to appear, the driver refused to remove part of the sticker, citing the First Amendment. That's when the deputy arrested him.

A Lake City man with a crude sticker on the back window of his Chevy truck ended up in the Columbia County jail Sunday after he refused to alter the offending words, citing his right to free speech.

A Columbia County sheriff's deputy pulled the pickup over on U.S. 90 around 5:50 p.m. after seeing the sticker — which stated ""I EAT A**"" in white letters, according to an arrest report. The deputy considered the statement a violation of Florida obscenity laws.

The driver and owner of the truck, Dillon Shane Webb, 23, became defensive when the deputy explained why he had been pulled over.

""They're just words,"" he said, according to the deputy's account.

""I then asked Dillon how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words,"" the report says. Webb responded that it would be up to the parent.

The deputy issued a notice to appear on the obscenity violation, a second-degree misdemeanor.

Then, the deputy wrote, ""I allowed him to remove one of the letters from the word 'A**' so the statement would no longer be derogatory."" But, he said, Webb refused to do so, citing the First Amendment.

That's when the deputy arrested him on a charge of resisting an officer without violence, a first-degree misdemeanor, and took him to jail. The truck was towed.

Bail was set at $2,500, and Webb was released at 8:50 that evening.

100,Report: Florida needs to bolster health preparedness,"TALLAHASSEE — As the 2019 hurricane season looms and as hepatitis A cases continue to soar in Florida, a report issued Wednesday shows that more work needs to be done to ensure the health and safety of residents against emerging infectious diseases, terrorism and extreme weather conditions.

Florida scored a 6.7 on the 2019 National Health Security Preparedness Index, putting it on par with the national average. The report, issued by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, analyzed 129 different measures for each state and the nation. The measures are spread across six broad categories and tallied for an overall score.

Glen Mays, a professor of health policy at the University of Kentucky who worked on the index, said the information is being shared to try to improve the nation’s ability to ensure the public health and safety of citizens during disasters.

“Given that as a country we are facing more of these emergency situations, natural disasters, man-made disasters and more disease outbreaks, so raising awareness about what each state can do and where the strengths are and also where the weaknesses are, we hope that can mobilize some people to take some action,” he said. “That’s the major purpose. Because when it comes to disaster preparedness, it’s largely a voluntary effort. You’re trying to get organizations willing to work together to do their part. And this provides a way of showing where we are.”

The assessment was originally developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2013. The goal is to attain a composite score of 9, which would indicate a “strong health security level.”

Florida earned a 9 in two categories: health security surveillance and incident and information management.

Health security surveillance encompasses the ability to monitor and detect health threats and to identify where hazards start and spread so that they can be contained rapidly. Incident and information management focuses on the ability to deploy people, supplies, money and information to locations where they are most effective in protecting health.

Mays said the state’s scores in those areas are buoyed by its experiences with hurricanes. “Practice makes perfect,” he said.

Florida lags the national average in half of the six categories and outperforms the nation in the other half. For example, Mays noted Florida’s lackluster performance in community planning and engagement, which involves developing and maintaining relationships among government agencies, community organizations and households.

Florida scored a 4.8 in the category, below the national average of 5.2.

“That’s foundational to everything else you do to be prepared for disasters,” Mays said. “In that domain, we are measuring how well organizations are communicating and coordinating their activities and if they are well-positioned to kind of share information and resources to better respond when disasters strike. So it’s really critical stuff.”

The state also lagged behind in two other categories: health-care delivery and countermeasure management.

Health-care delivery focuses on the ability to ensure access to high-quality medical services across the continuum of care during and after disasters and emergencies. Mays said the state’s overall performance in the category was hindered by worse-than-average nursing home performance and mental-health access.

Mays said Florida nursing homes in 2018 had a higher-than-average number of federal citations for failing to comply with emergency preparedness plans. Moreover, he said, “a larger share of the population in the state of Florida is underserved by mental-health professionals. They are very important in helping people, particularly in the aftermath of disasters.”

Countermeasure management evaluates the ability to store and deploy health-related products and supplies that protect people from diseases and injuries. The average score nationwide was 6.5 out of 10. Florida scored 6.1.

Mays said the performance on the measurement also was due to the state’s relatively low vaccination rates for seniors and young children. Though there is growing controversy about vaccines, they are one of the best countermeasures to keep people protected from disease.

“It’s a problem nationally, but it looks like Florida may have a little more of a problem in that area,” Mays told The News Service of Florida.

The score regarding vaccinations came amid an outbreak of hepatitis A. Florida has had a reported 1,037 cases of the liver disease this year, nearly double the amount reported for all of 2018, according to numbers posted on the state Department of Health website.

Hepatitis A can be spread through such things as food or drinks that have been contaminated with fecal matter from people with the disease. Health officials have urged people to get vaccinated against the disease.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190510/report-florida-needs-to-bolster-health-preparedness?rssfeed=true,2019-05-10T17:50:00Z,Daily Commercial,Florida Man,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748

106,Florida man Randy Herman Jr. gets life for slaying he blamed on sleepwalking,"Randy Herman Jr., 26, received a life sentence in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston on March 25, 2017.

WEST PALM BEACH — After about five hours of deliberations, a 12-person jury found Randy Herman Jr. guilty of first-degree murder Wednesday in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston in 2017, rejecting the defense that he was sleepwalking when he attacked her in suburban West Palm Beach.

After the verdict was read, both Preston's family and Herman's family teared up silently on opposite sides of the courtroom as Circuit Judge John Kastrenakes thanked the jury for its service of more than a week in the case. Before the judge sentenced Herman, 26, to the mandatory term of life in prison, Preston's sister, Jordan, spoke briefly before the court.

As she tried to stifle her tears, she explained nothing has been the same since her sister was killed. The sisters and Herman had know each other since they were teenagers and lived together for more than six months at the home where she was attacked. Jordan Preston was not in the residence at the time of the fatal stabbing.

""The last few years without her have been awful. Our lives are totally different,"" she said.

Outside the courtroom, Preston's father, John, walked surrounded by more than a dozen family members and friends who came down from Pennsylvania for the trial.

""There's no winners in this whole situation. Everybody's losers,"" he said.

Herman and his lawyers had argued he was sleepwalking when he stabbed Preston more than 20 times on the morning of March 25, 2017, and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors told the jury Herman's actions were deliberate and not the product of an alleged sleepwalking episode.

Investigators said Preston had finished packing up and was ready to move to New York when Herman sent her a text message, asking her to pick up a shirt before she left to give to a friend. When Herman testified last week, he said he thought Preston had come back to the house that morning, he had given her a shirt, then they had hugged goodbye, she left and he went back to sleep.

“The next thing (I know), I’m standing over top of her and I have a knife in my hand, covered in blood,” Herman said. “I was confused. Scared. Didn’t know what to do. Didn’t know what happened.”

Herman then drove to a nearby park, called 911 and told them that even though he didn't remember what had happened, he said he must have been the one that killed Preston because no one else was home.

Over the course of the trial, which began with testimony April 30, the jury heard from Palm Beach County sheriff's detectives; Herman; Jordan Preston; Kyle McGregor, the man who last saw Preston alive; as well as from experts who testified both for against the sleepwalking defense.

In his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant Public Defender Joseph Walsh said there was no logical answer to what happened. There was no motive, no history of violence and no issues between Herman and Preston.

“There is no other rational explanation for this killing other than this could have been sleepwalking,"" Walsh said.

Dr. Charles Patrick Ewing, a forensic psychologist, testified Monday that he was ""truly puzzled"" by the case until he learned of Herman's history of sleepwalking.

“That really made sense to me, because I really couldn’t make any other sense of the case,” Ewing said.

He said while sleepwalking is uncommon and sleepwalking homicides are even less likely, they do happen and Herman met the criteria: The person attacked was well-loved by the attacker, there appeared to be no motive in the case, Herman said he couldn't remember anything from the attack and he had a history of sleepwalking.

Herman's mother, Kathi Adams, testified that she had witnessed several episodes as Herman was a child, but Jordan Preston said in the years she had known him and lived with him, she never saw him sleepwalk.

On Tuesday, prosecutors had Dr. Wade C. Myers, a forensic psychiatrist, testify and say that there's no way Herman could have slept through the 20-plus stabs he inflicted on Preston because it was too complex of an action.

Instead, he suggested the motive in the killing may be sexually based, drawing from an alleged incident the night before the stabbing where Herman reportedly hid in Brooke Preston's closet naked after a day of drinking heavily. No one saw the alleged incident and it was only known because Preston reportedly told McGregor and asked to spend the night with him.

Preston's sister testified that there was no sexual or romantic interest between herself, her sister or Herman.

Over the years, there have been several high-profile murder cases where those accused have claimed sleepwalking as a defense for their actions and have had their juries rule both for and against them.

In 2015, Joseph Mitchell was found not guilty of strangling his 4-year-old son to death after his attorneys argued he was sleepwalking at the time of the attack in North Carolina. In 1999, an Arizona man was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his wife after he claimed he was sleepwalking when he stabbed her and then dragged her to the pool and held her head under water.

During his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant State Attorney Reid Scott said Herman was not sleepwalking and that he knew what he was doing.

""This is skin, this is bone, this is muscle (he's stabbing,)"" he said. ""You're not going to sleepwalk through that.""",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190509/florida-man-randy-herman-jr-gets-life-for-slaying-he-blamed-on-sleepwalking?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T10:00:53Z,The Ledger,Florida Man,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815
109,"Dog recovering after Florida man drags him behind truck, deputies say","HERNANDO COUNTY, Fla. - A dog that was dragged behind behind a truck is recovering and in good spirits, but the search is still on for the man accused of abusing him.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office on Wednesday announced that they were seeking the dog's owner, 48-year-old Gregory Tousignant, on an animal cruelty charge.

Deputies said Tousignant tied a piece of rope that was attached to the 1-year-old pit bull's collar to the back bumper of a truck then drove down Northcliffe Boulevard in Spring Hill Friday morning. The dog was eventually able to get loose from his collar.

Jan Harwood of Nature Coast Animal Wellness & Surgical Center in Weeki Wachee told WFTS that she saw the incident happen and immediately rendered aid to the dog, now named Ollie.

""It’s the most horrific thing I honestly have ever seen and I can’t get it out of my head,"" Harwood told the TV station.

The dog is now recovering at the veterinary clinic. Photos posted on the clinic's Facebook page show road-rash type injuries to Ollie's left side, including on his paws and face.

Since then, more recent updates show Ollie cuddling with clinic staff, wagging his tail and wearing the cone of shame to stop him from licking.

Despite being sore, staff said Ollie appears to be in good spirits and loves attention.

""He is tolerating his treatment without hesitation and that tail is wagging like nothing ever happened,"" the clinic posted on its Facebook page. ""What a sweet baby we have here.""

WTSP reports that Ollie will be available for treatment once his wounds heal.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office is asking anyone with information concerning Tousignant's whereabouts to call 352-754-6830.

112,Florida man arrested after refusing to remove obscene sticker from vehicle,"MIAMI - A Florida man who was jailed after refusing to remove what authorities called an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window said Tuesday that he is fighting the charges and will defend his constitutional right to free speech.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said.

Webb told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit against the sheriff's office.

""I'm tired of police forces thinking they are above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,"" Webb said.

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

Wedd said the deputy seemed angry from the start of the traffic stop.

""Like the whole time, he was just really rude,"" Webb told the AP. ""It just felt to me like his goal was to get me in jail.""

The deputy said he asked Webb how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words, and Webb said that ""it would be up to the parent.""

Webb told the AP that he didn't imagine the sticker doing any serious damage to children.

""I've had parents drive by me with their kids taking pictures,"" Web said. ""They point and laugh and giggle, and they go on about their day.""

Webb said he had the sticker on his truck for less than a week before his traffic stop. He said he and several friends had all decided to get similar stickers as a group joke.

""I guess this cop just didn't find it funny, and he just thought he has to put me in jail,"" Webb said.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court, the report said. The deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused.

""I said I'm not removing any letters on my sticker because that's in violation of my First Amendment rights as a tax-paying citizen,"" Webb said.

The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail. Webb was released several hours later on $2,500 bond.

Webb's vehicle had been towed when he was arrested. He said the sticker was still in place when he retrieved the vehicle.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida released a statement Tuesday questioning why the sheriff's office was wasting resources on such a traffic stop.

""Shouldn't police officers spend their time serving and protecting communities and not pulling Floridians over for speech that is already protected by the First Amendment?"" ACLU spokeswoman Casey Bruce-White said in a statement. ""Using the excuse that a child would see and ask questions about this particular bumper sticker is absurd.""

The sheriff's office told the AP that deputy had probable cause of a violation of criminal law and took action. ""If the law is faulty then the legislature can address that or if the law is unconstitutional then the judiciary will address it, Sgt. Murray Smith said, adding that the defendant will have his day in court.

Webb said he wasn't even aware of the state's obscenity law, but after reviewing it since his arrest, he said it needs to be changed. He acknowledged that his sticker could be considered vulgar by some, but the law doesn't really define what that is.

""What's vulgar to me might not be vulgar to somebody else,"" Webb said.

121,Florida man charged with DUI on his lawn mower,"HAINES CITY, Fla. - A Florida man arrested on DUI charges is nothing new, but when you add a lawn mower to the equation, it becomes a true #FloridaMan story.

Police arrested Gary Wayne Anderson, 68, Saturday after he crashed his lawn mower into a Haines City police vehicle.

An officer was inside a local business when he heard a loud crash from outside. After walking outside, the officer found Anderson sitting atop a lawn mower with a trailer.

Anderson admitted to hitting the vehicle while riding his lawn mower and was given a field sobriety test, which he failed.

While at the police department, Anderson claimed to have been poisoned by police and demanded to be taken to the hospital. At the hospital, Anderson's blood-alcohol content was registered at .241, more than three times the legal limit.

Cocaine was also found in Anderson's blood, but he said the police put the cocaine there.

According to police, Anderson's driver's license has been suspended since 1978 and he has two prior DUI convictions.

125,Florida State coach Willie Taggart discusses state of the program during Fort Myers trip,"CLOSE FSU football coach Willie Taggart visited Fort Myers during Seminoles Boosters 2019 Spring Tour on Thursday. Adam Regan, AREGAN@NEWS-PRESS.COM

Willie Taggart wasn’t hiding Thursday. The Florida State coach wasn’t ducking any questions from any Seminoles fans.

In fact, that’s what the Seminoles Boosters 2019 Spring Tour that kicked off in Fort Myers at the IMAG museum is all about.

Facetime with loyal supporters, discussing the state of the football program, answering questions and concerns they had about a team that missed out on a bowl game for the first time in 36 years in Taggart’s first season.

Taggart characterized 2018 as a teaching moment for his staff and players, but emphasized the focus was on 2019 while speaking to local alumni.

""We've moved on. We don't live there anymore,"" Taggart said of the 5-7 2018 campaign. ""We're in 2019. This is a totally different team and we understand the issues we have and we're working to correct those things. And we've made improvement in those things.

""Again, we're not going to be able to show everyone until the season starts. But we know within ourselves that we're doing the thing that it takes to be able to be the winning team that we all want. One thing we can't do is stay on '18. We have to move forward.""

After the Dunbar High band serenaded fans with the FSU fight song, Taggart faced questions about the program head on about the program’s status as the worst Power 5 program when it comes to APR (Academic Progress Rate), discussed his recent success on the recruiting trail as well as his staff’s dominance over Florida and Miami in recruiting Lee County.

The former USF and Oregon coach described FSU as his dream job when he was hired in December 2017 following the departure of national championship-winning coach Jimbo Fisher to Texas A&M. And with that job came high expectations.

“You don’t want to be at a place where they don’t care,” said Taggart, who added the job was everything he wanted it to be.

With Fisher’s departure, there were some issues the new staff understood it had to clean up.

FSU saw its multi-year APR fall to 936 after posting a single-year APR of 922 for 2017-18. Should it drop below 930 the Seminoles could be in danger of not being eligible to participate in championships according to NCAA rules.

""We're making sure our guys are going to class and we're recruiting the right guys who want to come there for both,"" Taggart said. ""I think, more importantly, it's holding our guys accountable. Our guys had a heck of a semester in the classroom. We had 29 guys get their personal best this semester. We had over 24 guys with over a 3.0 or better. That's just with 87 guys on the team.

""I think with the APR you don't get there in one year and you don't change it in one year. But you put a plan together and you work to get it done. We've always had a plan. Academics have always been first. No matter where we were we're going to work to get it better and it will be better. I think as that gets better you'll see better play as well.""

In terms of recruiting, Taggart and his staff jumped 10 spots to No. 4 in the 247Sports composite team rankings with five recent commitments of four-star wide receiver Malachi Wideman, four-star cornerback Jalen Harrell, four-star Jaylon McCluster, three-star defensive end Josh Griffis and three-star Derek Bermudez.

""Our recruits are showing they're enjoying this too and excited about Florida State and where we're going,"" said Taggart, who couldn’t comment on any specific recruit. ""I think you're seeing young men that want to be a part of the culture, want to be a part of the vision we have and get Florida State football back to where it belongs.""

Taggart, a Bradenton native, particularly has had success recruiting the Fort Myers area, bringing a number of recruits to USF and was instrumental in helping bring Fort Myers High running back Darrian Felix to Oregon.

""These young guys down here, they love football. Football is really important to them,"" Taggart said. ""They're coached well by some good coaches. I think those are the guys you want playing the game of football, the guys that love to compete. Tough guys, not just physically but mentally as well.""

He was thrilled four-star Lehigh defensive end Quashon Fuller stuck with the Seminoles over Alabama this past National Signing Day.

""Besides he's a good football player, I think he's a great young man who loves Florida State University,"" Taggart said. ""I think it's important as we continue to build our program and built the culture the way that we want to we get really good football players who love Florida State University. He's a young man who's been committed to us for a long time. He stayed true to us. To me, those kind of guys are going to give you everything you have and make sure we play like we're supposed to.""

So, what should Seminoles fans expect of FSU this year as they open with Boise State in Jacksonville on Aug. 31?

That was the question Taggart was waiting on.

""We should expect the football team we all wanted,"" Taggart said. ""That we've all wanted for a long time and that's a winning football team. A team that's playing with passion, playing Florida State football. The thing is you're not going to see that team unless you're there. Be there, support us like we know you will. And you'll see a football team every Seminole fan will be proud of.""

138,"Florida man had over 25K sexually explicit images and videos of children, deputies say","- A Florida man was arrested and charged with 57 counts of possessing child pornography on Monday.

The Volusia County Sheriff's Office reported that 48-year-old Wade Leon McKeehan was arrested on a warrant after he turned himself in at the DeLand Police Department at 2 a.m. He is charged with possessing photos and video images portraying sexual performance by a child.

They said that detectives found 25,529 electronic images and videos in McKeehan's possession. The images portrayed children of both genders between ages 1 and 13 in sexually explicit situations.

The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office’s Child Exploitation Unit reportedly began investigating McKeehan in December 2018. A search warrant on his home was finally executed on March 20th. Electronic devices were seized for forensic examination and detectives interviewed him.

An arrest warrant for McKeehan was issued Friday, the Sheriff's Office said. He was taken into custody and transported to the Volusia County Branch Jail. He remains there on no bail allowed until his first appearance before a judge.

More charges are possible, the Sheriff's Office said. Detectives are still searching for any additional potential victims of sexual exploitation. Anyone who may have been a victim of this suspect or any similar case is urged to call the Child Exploitation Unit at (386) 323-3574.

Gary Wayne Anderson, 68, was arrested on charges of driving under the influence after crashing his lawn mower into a Haines City Police Department vehicle around 7 p.m. Saturday

According to Haines City police, the cruiser was parked at Rodriguez Fashion at 1100 U.S. 17-92 while the officer was tending to another matter. The officer heard a loud noise and saw Anderson on a riding mower pulling an attached trailer, police said.

There was minor damage to the rear plastic portion of the police vehicle's bumper, officials said.

Anderson told police that he hit the vehicle, but didn't cause any damage and that he was drunk, according to authorities.

Anderson was unable to complete field sobriety tests and claimed that he had been poisoned by police and asked to be taken to a hospital, officials said. Anderson was taken to Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, police said.

Anderson's blood alcohol content was more than three times the legal limit of 0.08, said police, who added that there was also cocaine in his system.

""I'm proud of the professional demeanor our officers showed when dealing with this heavily intoxicated, belligerent offender,"" Police Chief Jim Elensky said. ""It's never a good idea to get behind the wheel drunk, even if that wheel is to a Craftsman, Massey Ferguson or John Deere.""

Police said Anderson's driver's license has been suspended since March 1978.

Officials said Anderson has two prior DUI convictions, with the most recent occurring in 1987 in Osceola County.

144,"South Florida man stabs sleeping mother several times, deputies say","Ryan Guenot, 30, is accused of stabbing his mother several times while she was sleeping.

ROYAL PALM BEACH, Fla. - A South Florida man was arrested Friday after he attacked his sleeping mother, stabbing her several times, deputies said.

Ryan Guenot, 30, of Royal Palm Beach, faces a charge of attempted first-degree murder.

According to a Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office probable cause affidavit, Guenot's half-brother, Javier Gallardo, called 911 Friday morning and said his brother ""had cut his mother with a knife and left the residence.""

When deputies arrived, they found a large blood trail leading into the home and blood smears on a wall.

Gallardo told detectives he was sleeping in his room when he heard his mother screaming about 6 a.m. Gallardo said he pulled Guenot off her and put him in a headlock before Guenot broke free and ran out of the house.

Tina Guenot, 57, told detectives her son came home from SunFest about 3 a.m. She went back to sleep but woke up a few hours later ""to what felt like punches to her head.""

Detectives said Tina Guenot had a cut to the back of her head, three stab wounds to her face, two stab wounds to her chest and one cut across her neck.

""The tip of a knife was also discovered to be broken off inside Tina's head as a result of being stabbed,"" the affidavit said.

Ryan Guenot was later spotted along Okeechobee Boulevard and taken into custody. Detectives said he asked how his mother was doing.

During a recorded confession, Ryan Guenot said he came home and saw his mother sleeping in the living room. He said he went to sleep in his room but woke up at some point after falling asleep.

""Ryan initially said he did not recall any details but knew that he attacked his mother,"" the affidavit said. ""Ryan later added he woke up and vaguely remembered grabbing a knife from the kitchen drawer.""

According to the affidavit, Ryan Guenot went on to say that ""he proceeded to attack Tina with the goal of killing her. Ryan told me something in his head told him to kill his mom.""

Ryan Guenot was being held without bond at the main Palm Beach County jail.

Sheriff's spokeswoman Teri Barbera said Tina Guenot was in critical condition Friday at an area hospital.

145,Texas man recovering after shark bite in Florida,"CLOSE Paul Kelly said the worst part of the day was losing the tarpon he was trying to reel in. Fort Myers News-Press

The worst part of a Texas man's trip to Florida wasn't when he got bit by a shark on a fishing trip.

It's when he lost the tarpon he was trying to reel in.

Speaking from the Lee Memorial Hospital on Saturday, Paul Kelly, 72, said it was still a good trip overall.

""We lost the fish of course,"" Kelly said. ""That was the worst part.""

Kelly said he was on a six-hour fishing trip with his good friend and a boat captain in Boca Grande Pass on Wednesday.

Near the end of the trip, both he and his friend had hooked sizable tarpon, he said.

Kelly said he was trying to work in a 150-pound tarpon when his shoe slipped and he was yanked into the water by the fish.

While he was underwater, Kelly said he felt something hit his leg. He didn't realize at the time it was a shark nibbling on it.

The captain pulled him to the boat with a fishing rod, and his buddy hoisted him into the boat by his belt.

Once he was in the boat, the captain told him a shark had bitten him, and that it appeared to be an eight to 10-foot bull shark, Kelly said.

That's when he noticed a gash around his left knee and calf, he said.

The men acted quickly, wrapping a belt around his left thigh to stop the bleeding as they raced to shore. Paramedics swarmed him, dressing his leg and securing a tourniquet. Kelly was airlifted to the trauma center.

Surgeons stitched him up, and he had surgery on a torn tendon in his knee the next day.

The Vietnam veteran said he barely felt pain through the whole incident or post surgery.

""You do the best with what you get,"" he said.

Doctors told him he should be able to leave the hospital in the next few days. He and his wife hope to return to Texas on Monday.

The trauma surgeon who treated Kelly, Robert L'Connor, said he's seen alligator bites, but never a shark bite.

""They aren't that frequent to be honest with you,"" L'Connor said. ""It's something everybody is concerned with when they get into the water, but it's the first one I've seen in 10 years.""

It demonstrates the necessity of the trauma center, which serves trauma patients from the surrounding five counties and just celebrated its 25th year in business, L'Connor said.

Though Florida annually tops the leader board for attacks in the United States, bites plummeted last year compared with previous years, according to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), a University of Florida database that tracks shark attacks worldwide.

There were 16 confirmed attacks in Florida last year, compared to 31 in 2017, according to ISAF data.

In Lee and Collier counties, 16 attacks have been confirmed by ISAF, which keeps records dating back to 1882.

In 2005, a young Austrian tourist was bitten on the right ankle in Lee County. Then in 2007, a shark bit a man off a Naples beach.

In 2001, a Lee County Sheriff's Office captain who was then a part-time fishing guide was bit by a blacktip shark.

They said that the suspect tried to hide in the woods, but he was no match for their K-9 Deputy Tag.

The suspect was reportedly wanted on drug charges. When deputies tried to pull him over, he took off, eventually crashing and running into the woods.

He is now behind bars and facing a long list of charges.

148,Florida man wore woman's wig to escape arrest,"- A drug suspect on Florida's Space Coast tried to elude deputies setting up a perimeter around his house for a bust by bicycling away disguised in a woman's blond wig.

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office said they arrested Robert Walls despite his attempt at disguise.

The sheriff's office says in a statement that when agents caught up with Walls last Thursday to arrest him, he admitted that he was using the wig as a disguise to elude them.

The sheriff's office says he was wanted by a fugitive task force seeking suspects from a major drug investigation that led to arrest warrants for more than 100 defendants.

Online court records show no attorney listed for Walls. He faces charges of solicitation to sell a controlled substance and criminal conspiracy.

Rob Thomas

Rob Thomas is known as the front-man for Matchbox 20, but perhaps his greatest claim to fame was singing on Santana's wildly successful song ""Smooth"" that he co-wrote.

It won three Grammys in 2000, including Song of the Year and as last year Billboard considered the second most successful song of all time after Chubby Checker's 1960 hit ""The Twist.""

Thomas and his ""Chip Tooth Tour"" into the Sunshine State this summer, with concerts set for July 2 at Mizner Park in Boca Raton; July 3 at Hard Rock Live Orlando; July 5 at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg; and July 6 at Daily's Place in Jacksonville.

His Matchbox 20 hits have remained pop music staples in recent years, including ""Real World,""""3AM"" and ""Push.""

Brian Regan

Jerry Seinfeld has called him one of his favorite comedians, and Brian Regan has earned his stature among standup legends.

The South Florida native tours it seems constantly, and returns to Florida with shows July 26 at Barbara B. Mann Hall in Fort Myers with tickets around $50 each.

The next night, Regan is at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg and tickets start around $40.

Regan is known for his clean comedy, with popular skits including ""Say Eight"" and ""Doughnut Lady.""

He still prides himself on being able to walk in public pretty much anonymously; a few years ago in an interview with the Naples Daily News, Regan discussed how he and his children had just spent a day at Disney World in Orlando and he went unrecognized.

A 911 call from a lonely 6-year-old boy could have ended with stern discipline instead of a stuffed animal and perhaps a budding friendship.

More: 'Hundreds of bugs' in child's backpack, poor hygiene, leads to Florida mom's arrest

The boy, who's name hasn't been released, said his mom was ""mean"" and made him cry, according to the 911 call. The dispatcher stayed on the line and asked him several questions, including his age, address and where were his parents, who were unaware their son called 911.

Tallahassee Police Officer Joe White was en route when the boy called a few more times to make sure an officer was coming. Once he arrived, the boy asked if he and White could be friends.

The Tallahassee Police Department posted on Facebook pictures of White and the boy holding a stuffed animal given by White. The officer informed the boy of when to use 911.

TPD spokesman Damon Miller told the Tallahassee Democrat the social media post was made by another public information officer so he couldn't confirm whether White made contact with the boy's parents before the post was made public.

Here’s Officer Joe White's his new friend, who called 911 because he was lonely. (Photo: Tallahassee Police Department)

Steve Harrelson, director of the Consolidated Dispatch Agency, said it's rare that a child calls 911 because they're lonely.

""Realizing he was a child, we put some extra attention to that,"" said Harrelson, who urged parents to teach their children about 911. ""It was a great conclusion to an incident that could have been a lot worse. (White) used that moment to educate the uses of 911 ... It worked all the way around for everyone.""

Miller said White did what most officers do every day, but most people don't know about. He said it's not unusual for officers to have similar encounters with children.

""He let the young man know that they can be his friend and how to use the 911,"" Miller said. ""This is a classic example that we are humans as well, and we are not robots.""

The offseason travel plans for Florida A&M football coach Willie Simmons includes various destinations throughout the state.

These multi-purpose trips serve as a platform to promote the program and for recruiting.

Currently, the second-year Rattler coach is in South Florida. He's scheduled to attend a speaking engagement on Thursday in Palm Beach County.

Simmons joins FAMU athletics director Dr. John Eason for a roundtable discussion. This event, which is hosted by Palm Beach FAMU National Alumni Association chapter, convenes at the Embassy Suites by Hilton West Palm Beach Central.

""Tommy Mitchell is the executive director of the Rattler Boosters. Every year, he tries to roll out a tour for me to solicit funds from our boosters,"" Simmons said.

""This gives us some face time with them, answer some questions and tell them the state of the program. I'm excited to be down there with them. It's during the recruiting season, so it kills two birds with one stone.""

During the session, Simmons will highlight the on and off-the-field progress of the program. He'll also encourage alumni to show their support by purchasing tickets and contributing to the Investing in Champions campaign.

Dr. Eason will address the overall status of FAMU Athletics for the 2018-19 school year.

""The roundtable is two-fold. We are inviting Rattlers from the area to have an open dialogue about football and the athletic department. We'll also have parents there whose kids are going to play sports,"" said Monica McCoy, first vice president of the FAMU NAA Palm County chapter.

""It's one thing to talk to someone on the phone in their office. It's another to have someone there to talk with you in person. It's a great thing to have the department head and football coach to answer our questions.""

Earlier in the week, Simmons visited high schools. He was joined on the recruiting trail by assistant coaches Billy Rolle (cornerbacks) and Jelani Berassa. Both men hail from Miami and have strong ties to the region.

They spoke with coaches, players and administrators from Miami Central, Miami Northwestern, Miami Jackson and Blanche Ely in Pompano Beach, Broward County.

""The head coaches at the high schools were excited we were here. They were especially excited to see coach Rolle,"" Berassa said.

They're not used to FAMU's coaches coming down to the schools. He's (Simmons) been wanting to get to Miami. We spoke with them for a good while. We also got a chance to look at some good players. With so many alumni in the area, it's good for us to be here. Coach Rolle and I are from here, so they were happy to see us.""

Simmons also encouraged players to attend the upcoming summer camps.

There will be four sessions between June and July.

The workouts for rising high school freshmen through seniors are the Elite Prospect Camp I, II, Big Man Camp and RAC Boyz 7 on 7 Team Camp. These events take place June 1, July 13 and 20 respectively.

FAMU will also host the Junior Rattlers Football Camp on June 3. This is for rising students from first to eighth grade.

""Talking to coaches, players and administrators are our main purposes to get on the road,"" Simmons said. ""We want to get to know them on a personal level. We also to drive our camps so we can have a huge turnout and coach them in person.""",http://rssfeeds.tallahassee.com/~/601752382/0/tallahassee/home~Simmons-visits-South-Florida-for-recruiting-FAMU-Palm-Beach-County-alumni/,2019-05-08T20:59:28Z,Tallahassee Democrat,Florida Man,"277 N Magnolia Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA",FL,32301

162,Florida man receives toll violation for license plate he owned 25 years ago,"PORT ORANGE, Fla. - A Port Orange man is frustrated that the Florida Department of Transportation continues to send a bill to his Central Florida home for two toll violations that happened in South Florida last August.

""I wasn't even in the state of Florida at the time,"" said Thomas McMullen.

McMullen said he was on vacation in Canandaigua, New York, when the toll violation happened. The vehicle captured by the toll cameras is a tractor-trailer, something McMullen says he's never owned.

Not only that, he said he has not owned the license plate captured in the photo for almost 25 years.

""I may have thrown it in the garbage. I may have sold it. I don't know,"" said McMullen, who is an avid classic car collector.

He said he has bought and sold more than 100 cars in his lifetime and doesn't keep track of all of them or the tags that went with them.



He only collects special licesnse plates, including a Purple Heart plate that hangs on the wall in his garage.

""You know, I'm a soldier, and I fought for our country,"" McMullen said. ""This is a DAV tag of mine for Disabled (American) Veteran.""

McMullen said he has also bought old license plates on eBay as part of his classic car obsession. He had no idea that the license plates assigned to him would stay linked to him all these years later.

""I mean, this tag is 25 years old,"" McMullen said. ""Why am I responsible for this?""

McMullen said he kept calling the state to dispute the charges, but they kept sending him a bill. He said he just wants SunPass to stop sending him these bills and to find out what really happened.

""It's giving me a lot of aggravation,"" said McMullen. ""And I don't need any aggravation.""

That's why he called News 6 .

The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles confirms the license plate expired in 1995 and has not been renewed. The agency confirms unless the plate is reported lost or stolen, it will remain active and continue to be linked to the original owner.

But once we started digging deeper into McMullen's case, we discovered another mystery. The license plate on the 18-wheeler captured on camera may not even be McMullen's old plate after all.

If you zoom in on the picture, you can clearly see that the second zero on the plate is not like the first.

McMullen said the FDOT picked up the anomaly, and within an hour of our visit, the agency called him to say the plate in the picture whad been altered, and that the agency was waiving the toll charges.



News 6 checked McMullen’s account and discovered the charge for $47.25 has been officially erased.



What can you do with your old plates?

According to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, license plates are issued to the person, not the vehicle. So, when conducting a private sale of a vehicle, license plates stay with the seller, not the vehicle.



In addition, if you are not going to renew your license plate, you can return it to any tax collector's office, mail it to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, destroy it, or keep it in a safe place where no one can access it.



If you are going to sell a car privately, take off the license plate. You can then mail it back to The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles so the agency can take it out of circulation.

The department offers a sellers checklist to help consumers protect themselves in a private sale:

Apply for a demonstration-only temporary tag, if needed;

Conduct a vehicle identification number inspection, if necessary;

Record odometer reading on title;

Complete title transfer in a motor vehicle service center.

Remove license plate from the sold vehicle;

Surrender the license plate, if applicable;

File a Notice of Sale, form HSMV 82050.

Visit the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles website to learn more about buying and selling a vehicle.

What happens if your license plate is lost or stolen?

When the FLHSMV a customer completes the form and provides a copy of a police report or agency card containing the case number, the replacement will be issued at no charge.

Questions or discrepancies found on your SunPass bill can be addressed online here.

165,Sheriff's Office: Wanted Florida man hoped blonde wig would disguise him from deputies as he biked away,"Moral of the story from sheriff's office: Above all else DO NOT wear a hideous wig while trying to run from the Po/Po on a bicycle.

A Florida fugitive wanted on drug charges tried to elude deputies surrounding the home he was in Thursday by donning a long blonde wig and riding off on a bicycle, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office said.

The wig didn't work, and agents caught up with and arrested Robert “Bobby” Walls soon after watching him ride away, deputies said.

Walls later admitted he put the wig on in hopes that officers wouldn't recognize him and that he'd avoid arrest, deputies said.

Investigators had set up a perimeter around the residence after getting a tip he was there. Walls' warrant was one of over 100 in ""a significant drug investigation"" by the sheriff's office.

Walls was charged with conspiracy to possess controlled substance, solicitation to sell controlled substance, and unlawful use of a two-way device.

So here is the moral of the story,"" the sheriff's office posted on its Facebook page.

171,Florida man accused of torturing girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter,"- A Florida man is accused of torturing his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter by burning her, shooting her with a BB gun and wearing a werewolf mask to scare her.

Andrew Ross Celaius was arrested April 9 but additional charges were announced Wednesday. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan described videos investigators found of the 37-year-old torturing the child as ""the thing nightmares are made of.""

Morgan says Celaius placed the dog collar on the girl and shocked her awake at night. Then he stood over her wearing a werewolf mask.

Investigators say the mother didn't know about the abuse. It was discovered when she brought the girl to the hospital for treatment of ringworm, which turned out to be burns.

Celaius faces multiple counts of child cruelty. A lawyer isn't listed on jail records.

177,Trump promises more relief for Florida Panhandle,"“We will never, ever leave your side,” Trump said following chants of “USA” and “four more years” from a crowd at the Aaron Bessant Park Amphitheater. “We’ve already given you billions of dollars, and there is a lot more coming.”

TALLAHASSEE — President Donald Trump on Wednesday vowed Tyndall Air Force Base will be rebuilt after sustaining massive damage in Hurricane Michael, and he will approve the state’s request to boost federal funding for storm recovery in Northwest Florida.

Trump, during a campaign rally in Panama City Beach, said the federal reimbursement levels for hurricane recovery in the region will be boosted from 75% to 90% “in many circumstances.”

“We will never, ever leave your side,” Trump said following chants of “USA” and “four more years” from a crowd at the Aaron Bessant Park Amphitheater. “We’ve already given you billions of dollars, and there is a lot more coming.”

He said $448 million has been approved by his administration for housing disaster recovery assistance.

Trump’s comments came as he and Senate Republicans are locked in a battle with Democrats over how much of a stalled federal disaster-relief package should go to Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017. Delays in the relief package have frustrated Panhandle officials and residents.

Hurricane Michael devastated parts of the region after it made landfall Oct. 10 in Mexico Beach, east of Panama City. Gov. Ron DeSantis requested increased federal assistance after the storm was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane on April 19.

Panama City Mayor Greg Brudnicki told WJHG Newschannel 7 it’s “encouraging” to get a promise of increased federal funding and the restoration of Tyndall.

“We know if they’re going to rebuild Tyndall, they have to rebuild Mexico Beach, they have to rebuild Panama City and all the rest of the municipalities around it because we support Tyndall,” Brudnicki said. “It’s 30% of our economy, and 90% of the people that work at Tyndall live in our cities. So we know if they’re going to rebuild Tyndall, we’re going to get the appropriations to rebuild all our cities and the county.”

Trump’s rally followed a tour of Tyndall. He was joined by DeSantis, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, both Florida Republicans.

“I really believe Northwest Florida is going to come back stronger than ever before,” DeSantis told the crowd.

The Air Force has already spent $450 million rebuilding Tyndall, where about 700 structures were damaged as it and nearby Mexico City Beach took a direct hit from Michael, which came ashore with winds of 160 mph. However, the recovery effort effectively halted on the base on May 1 as Congress has not provided needed supplemental funding.

Trump said he kept the base from closing and reiterated an Air Force recommendation to eventually locate three squadrons of F-35 fighters at Tyndall. The recommendation was made as F-22s formerly at Tyndall were moved after the storm to Alaska, Hawaii and Virginia.

The region has received about $1.1 billion in federal aid, but that amount remains far below what officials say is needed to complete infrastructure repairs, remove debris, reduce the risks of wildfires, rebuild schools and restore businesses areas and residential communities.

“Great conversation with @realDonaldTrump on the flight to #Florida about #DisasterRelief for #HurricaneMichaelincluding support for timber, @TeamTyndall & a 90-10 federal match. optimistic that good news is on the way,” Rubio tweeted after the base tour.

Attorney General Ashley Moody, Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez and state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis were among those making opening remarks Wednesday night.

Patronis, who is from Panama City, called it a “blessing to have this much attention” from the president.

“This man could be anywhere, literally, he could be anywhere in the world today, but he’s here,” Patronis said. “And you’re being here is showing him that Northwest Florida will come back stronger than ever.”

Northwest Florida is a Republican stronghold, and Trump will need heavy support in the region as he runs for re-election next year. Before Trump arrived Wednesday, Democrats were already criticizing the president and Republicans for delays in storm response.

A Republican-sponsored proposal includes $610 million to fund a gap in Puerto Rico’s nutritional assistance program, an amount Florida Democrats called too low during a media conference call. U.S. Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., said the Democratic-led House, which approved a $14 billion relief package in February, would be willing to compromise if the Republican-run Senate could approve its own relief proposal.

Soto added Trump has inflated Puerto Rico relief numbers for political reasons.

“He continues to be overly sensitive about the failures of the administration, and his bruised ego is one of the reasons we find ourselves here today,” Soto said.

Soto noted that out of $41 billion allocated for Puerto Rico relief, $11 billion has been delivered.

Trump contended Wednesday night that money for the Panhandle recovery, as well as money for Midwest farmers recovering from flooding, Hurricane Florence victims in Georgia and the Carolinas and wildfire victims in California, is being delayed because Democrats want more for Puerto Rico.

Before departing for the Panhandle, Trump tweeted, “Getting ready to leave for one of my favorite places, the Florida Panhandle, where we’ve given, and are giving, billions of $$$ for the devastation caused by Hurricane Michael. Even though the Dems are totally in our way (they don’t want money to go there) we’re getting it done!”

Florida has already put up $1.64 billion for removing debris and providing other emergency assistance, money the state hopes to mostly recoup from the federal government.

Additionally, more than $220 million for recovery efforts was included in the state’s $91.1 billion budget that lawmakers approved Saturday.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., said during Wednesday’s Democratic conference call that the U.S. House will take up a supplemental funding bill on Friday that includes $700 million for Tyndall.

“Tyndall Air Force Base was flattened, absolutely flattened,” Wasserman Schultz said. “They should not have had to wait this long for the necessary and vital rebuilding support that they need.”",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190508/trump-promises-more-relief-for-florida-panhandle?rssfeed=true,2019-05-08T20:27:26Z,News Chief,Florida Man,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881

The offseason travel plans for Florida A&M football coach Willie Simmons includes various destinations throughout the state.

These multi-purpose trips serve as a platform to promote the program and for recruiting.

Currently, the second-year Rattler coach is in South Florida. He's scheduled to attend a speaking engagement on Thursday in Palm Beach County.

Simmons joins FAMU athletics director Dr. John Eason for a roundtable discussion. This event, which is hosted by Palm Beach FAMU National Alumni Association chapter, convenes at the Embassy Suites by Hilton West Palm Beach Central.

""Tommy Mitchell is the executive director of the Rattler Boosters. Every year, he tries to roll out a tour for me to solicit funds from our boosters,"" Simmons said.

""This gives us some face time with them, answer some questions and tell them the state of the program. I'm excited to be down there with them. It's during the recruiting season, so it kills two birds with one stone.""

During the session, Simmons will highlight the on and off-the-field progress of the program. He'll also encourage alumni to show their support by purchasing tickets and contributing to the Investing in Champions campaign.

Dr. Eason will address the overall status of FAMU Athletics for the 2018-19 school year.

""The roundtable is two-fold. We are inviting Rattlers from the area to have an open dialogue about football and the athletic department. We'll also have parents there whose kids are going to play sports,"" said Monica McCoy, first vice president of the FAMU NAA Palm County chapter.

""It's one thing to talk to someone on the phone in their office. It's another to have someone there to talk with you in person. It's a great thing to have the department head and football coach to answer our questions.""

Earlier in the week, Simmons visited high schools. He was joined on the recruiting trail by assistant coaches Billy Rolle (cornerbacks) and Jelani Berassa. Both men hail from Miami and have strong ties to the region.

They spoke with coaches, players and administrators from Miami Central, Miami Northwestern, Miami Jackson and Blanche Ely in Pompano Beach, Broward County.

""The head coaches at the high schools were excited we were here. They were especially excited to see coach Rolle,"" Berassa said.

They're not used to FAMU's coaches coming down to the schools. He's (Simmons) been wanting to get to Miami. We spoke with them for a good while. We also got a chance to look at some good players. With so many alumni in the area, it's good for us to be here. Coach Rolle and I are from here, so they were happy to see us.""

The workouts for rising high school freshmen through seniors are the Elite Prospect Camp I, II, Big Man Camp and RAC Boyz 7 on 7 Team Camp. These events take place June 1, July 13 and 20 respectively.

FAMU will also host the Junior Rattlers Football Camp on June 3. This is for rising students from first to eighth grade.

181,Armed detention deputy accused in road rage incident in Florida Keys,"Jatavi Wendall Lee told deputies that he was running late for work at the Stock Island jail.

KEY LARGO, Fla. - A Monroe County detention deputy was arrested Tuesday after authorities said he drove erratically, nearly causing multiple collisions, and then berated one of the drivers while armed and in uniform.

Jatavi Wendall Lee, 35, of Miami, faces charges of reckless driving and obstructing a highway.

Adam Linhardt, a spokesman for the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, said the incident happened March 29 when Lee was driving along the Overseas Highway in Key Largo.

A motorist who witnessed Lee's reckless driving contacted the Monroe County Sheriff's Office and provided deputies with video of the incident from his dashboard camera, Linhardt said.

Witnesses told deputies that Lee was driving at high rate of speed and weaving in and out of lanes. Linhardt said Lee almost caused two collisions with his erratic maneuvers.

At one point, Lee, while driving an unmarked black car, illegally passed a white pickup truck, Linhardt said. After Lee passed the truck, he abruptly stopped, causing drivers behind him to slam on their brakes to avoid a crash, deputies said. Lee then got out of the car and shouted obscenities at the driver of the pickup truck, witnesses said.

Wearing a Sheriff's Office uniform and gun belt, Lee told the truck driver to “never do that again,” saying the truck driver didn't know where he was going, Lindhardt said.

The truck driver, a retired firefighter, said he did not report incident out of respect for law enforcement, but once he was contacted by deputies he corroborated the account of the man with the dashboard camera. The truck driver said Lee did not use any police lights during the stop. Linhardt added that as a detention deputy, Lee was not authorized to make traffic stops.

When questioned by deputies, Lee said he was running late for work at the Stock Island jail and admitted to driving erratically and stopping traffic.

At the time of the incident, Linhardt said Lee, who was hired as a detention deputy in 2017, was on probation in Miami-Dade County after he pleaded no contest to domestic battery and theft of a license plate tag in 2018.

According to Miami Gardens police, Lee slapped the mother of one of his children across the face when he ran into her and her new boyfriend at his child's day care center. He then followed the woman to a nearby gas station, where he stole the woman's license plate and threatened to shoot the couple, police said.

In 2009, Lee was accused of battery against the same woman.

The Monroe County Sheriff's Office has started the process to terminate Lee. He will have a hearing to determine whether he will be terminated on May 13. In the meantime, Lee has been placed on leave without pay and ordered to turn in his badge and uniform.

""I take these incidents very seriously,"" Sheriff Rick Ramsay said in a statement. ""I expect the highest level of professional conduct from Sheriff's Office staff. This type of behavior will never be tolerated under my leadership as reflected in the actions we have taken.""

184,Keith Urban takes a wild Uber ride to get to Florida music festival,"Apparently neither rain, nor lightning, nor the horrors of Interstate 95 could stop Keith Urban from performing at SunFest on Sunday.

The country music star from Australia was scheduled to perform on the Ford stage Sunday night around 7:30 p.m., but because of heavy rains, winds and lightning, his flight couldn’t land at Palm Beach International Airport. That flight was at first diverted to the Boca Raton airport, he explained to the crowd, but, when they couldn’t land in Boca, they eventually flew into Miami.

After a delay departing the plane because of lightning strikes, they grabbed an Uber and high-tailed it north. Urban and his band hit the stage just after 9 p.m. and played until about 10:30 p.m.

Urban told the crowd the Uber driver was going “like 150 miles an hour.” He said he didn’t speak English,” and just said “music?” which Urban said, “yes, turn it up.”

Urban told the crowd the driver at one point flashed his lights at a car in front of them because the driver was only doing 90.

Urban said he even downloaded an app so he could check the driver’s speed.

Urban tweeted during the ride north, with photos of the torrential downpour. ”...we are in an Uber and driving like the dude stole it ! (man I hope he didn’t ...) we may be a little late ... but WE WILL FREAKIN BE THERE - KU”

After the show, Urban sent two tweets thanking his fans and the Uber driver.

In a video posted to Twitter, Urban said they had just come offstage and mentioned SunFest and the “insane weather” and being rerouted to Miami. Urban, named the 2018 Country Music Awards’ Entertainer of the Year, apologized to his fans who had waited. “You guys were amazing, incredibly patient ... and completely gave us all the love in the world when we got here so thank you every much. ...”

A Florida fugitive wanted on drug charges tried to elude deputies surrounding the home he was in Thursday by donning a long blonde wig and riding off on a bicycle, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office said.

The wig didn't work, and agents caught up with and arrested Robert “Bobby” Walls soon after watching him ride away, deputies said.

Walls later admitted he put the wig on in hopes that officers wouldn't recognize him and that he'd avoid arrest, deputies said.

Investigators had set up a perimeter around the residence after getting a tip he was there. Walls' warrant was one of over 100 in ""a significant drug investigation"" by the sheriff's office.

Walls was charged with conspiracy to possess controlled substance, solicitation to sell controlled substance, and unlawful use of a two-way device.

Morgan said Celaius placed a dog collar on the girl and shocked her awake at night. Then, he stood over her wearing a werewolf mask, Morgan said.

Investigators said the mother didn't know about the abuse. It was discovered when she brought the girl to a hospital for treatment of ringworm, which turned out to be burns.

Celaius faces multiple counts of child cruelty. A lawyer isn't listed on jail records.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (WFLA) - A Florida man is behind bars after he allegedly beat a 3-year-old girl with a brick inside of a recycling bin and left her to die, The Miami Herald reported.

Tristin Tavares Bernard, 18, was arrested and charged early Friday morning with attempted second-degree murder, aggravated child abuse with great bodily harm and torture, and aggravated battery.

Police were called to a neighborhood in Miami Gardens at about 6 p.m. Thursday after a neighbor reported seeing Bernard beating the girl with a brick inside of a recycling bin.

Family members say Bernard is a relative who is mentally unstable.

The girl was being watched by her grandmother who told police she was babysitting the child when she lost track of her.

Sotomayor, who lives a block over, said he heard cries and saw Bernard hitting the girl in the head with the brick, then take off back to his mother's home, leaving the girl behind.

“She was in the bin and she was bleeding on the side of her head,” Jose Sotomayor, the witness, told CBS4. “Thank God I was able to save her life.”

The girl was rushed to Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood where she underwent surgery. She’s listed in critical condition.

Bernard was arrested and booked into jail, where he's being held on a total bond of $42,500 on the three charges.",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-man-accused-of-beating-child-with-brick-leaving-her-in-recycling-bin/1975849851,2019-05-03T14:11:23Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

201,"Florida cold case murder of Laralee Spear, 15, perplexes detectives 25 years later","The lone person ever indicted remains on death row in 2 other killings, but is not considered a suspect in this case.

Deerfoot Road had been insulated from violence before April 26, 1994.

It was known to be a tranquil place. The rural, narrow dirt road leads to a lakeside park where wildlife roam.

Twenty-five years ago, an abduction and a series of gunshots radically changed the complexion of that tucked-away location near DeLand.

Violence appeared at Deerfoot and no one knows who brought it there.

Laralee Spear, 15-year-old DeLand High School freshman, was shot to death moments after getting off her school bus. Her body was found on a concrete slab behind a burned-out house about 200 yards from her home and about a half-mile from her stop at the corner of Deerfoot and South Spring Garden Avenue. Her murder remains unsolved.

“This child got off the bus at 3:15 (p.m.) and at 5:30 (p.m.) we find her,” said Volusia County Sheriff’s Detective Steve White, the agency’s lead cold case detective. “It’s just unbelievable to me that could happen in that location so fast (to) a child who’s not involved in any activities that would put her in danger.”

The full chronology of that afternoon has Spear getting off her bus at 3:15 p.m. Her mother, Barbara Spear, reported her daughter missing at 4:05 p.m.

Eight minutes later, deputies were dispatched to the Spear home. They showed up eight minutes after that and started searching.

At 4:59 p.m., deputies in Air One, the Sheriff’s Office’s helicopter, joined the search party.

At 5:35 p.m., one of those deputies in the air saw a body lying behind the abandoned house. Those on the ground confirmed the girl’s identity.

White was working as a detective in the New Smyrna Beach office at the time. During the next few days, he and other detectives from the east side were ordered to assist in the Laralee Spear investigation. Everything else was put on hold.

“I came into work the next morning and it was, ‘Grab your stuff. You’re (temporary duty) in DeLand until they release you,’ ” he said. “My office, the Ormond (Beach) office all got together and we went over to DeLand and got our assignments. We did neighborhood canvassing for a week.”

More than 1,000 leads were called in during that first month after the murder. The case still wound up cold.

Detectives were told by the girl’s mother that it was out of character for her to wander off by herself. If she took any additional time to walk home, it was only to spend a few extra minutes to get a closer look at her neighbor’s horses. The Sheriff’s Office concluded early in the investigation that someone attacked Laralee Spear during her walk — when she was out of sight from the Spring Garden intersection.

It was estimated by one of the detectives working on the case that she had walked 200 yards before encountering her killer. He also concluded Spear was dead within 25 minutes from when she got off the bus.

Ralph Henshaw, who retired from the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office about a decade before the murder, is now a volunteer investigator with the agency’s Cold Case Unit. He was recruited by former sheriff Ben Johnson for the purpose of delving into the Spear case.

He has absorbed every detail.

“The bus driver (saw) her get off,” Henshaw said, recalling what witnesses told detectives. “She didn’t seem to have any problem. There was no on around the area (who looked) strange.”

A small group of people were selling plants near Spear’s stop. They watched Spear get off the bus and head toward her house. They noticed nothing suspicious.

A neighbor in one of the half-dozen or so houses along Deerfoot often would sit outside in his wheelchair in the afternoon. On this particular day, he wasn’t feeling well and didn’t come outside, Henshaw said.

There is no telling what he would have seen or heard had he been outside. Either way, there was one fewer set of eyes on that street.

“She walked by like she did every day, every school day, and nobody (saw) her after that,” Henshaw said.

Laralee Spear was an elite student. She was a cheerleader and a member of the Keyettes, a school service organization. She sang in her church choir and played piano. She was known to be a wholesome girl. She had a reputation for being punctual. Her principal called her a model student.

“She was an exceptional young lady,” Henshaw said.

Someone far below exceptional became the focus of the investigation in November 1994.

Bobby Allen Raleigh, a high school dropout, was charged in the double murder of two men in DeLeon Springs. The victims were slain six weeks after the Spear murder. The two men were asleep in a trailer when Raleigh and his accomplice, Domingo Figueroa, shot them in their sleep. They kept shooting the second victim until their guns jammed. After realizing the victim was still alive, Raleigh took his gun and beat the man until he stopped breathing.

While in jail awaiting trail for the double murder, Raleigh allegedly told an inmate he had killed Spear. That’s what the State Attorney’s Office disclosed to the media. Raleigh was indicted for first-degree murder in the Spear case.

For the DeLeon Springs double murder, Raleigh was convicted and sentenced to death row, where he remains to this day. His accomplice is serving a life sentence.

Raleigh, who was 20 at the time of his arrest and is now 44, seemed resigned to his fate in the double murder. By comparison, he was adamant he had nothing to do with the Spear killing. A special prosecutor who was later assigned to the case agreed. He dropped all charges against Raleigh in 1998.

Today, no one associated with the case seems to have any lingering suspicions about Raleigh.

“I don’t look at him as a suspect at all,” Henshaw said. He and Sheriff’s Sgt. A.J. Pagliari interviewed Raleigh face-to-face a few years ago and didn’t come away thinking he had anything to do with Spear’s murder.

“There was not enough then to pursue him criminally and there is nothing that has changed since that time to make us think he is at the top of any persons of interest list,” Pagliari said.

White and Pagliari said 66 people have been investigated since the start of the case. Pagliari indicated that nobody has emerged as a suspect.

“Has anything come to light that says this person is more of a suspect than somebody else? No,” he said.

Thirteen years after the murder, in April 2007, the Sheriff’s Office held a media conference with Virginia “Ginny” Spear, Laralee’s younger sister. She helped deputies distribute fliers to DeLand-area homes and businesses. It was a media blitz to get the case back in the news and on the minds of residents in the hopes it would induce someone to come forward with information. Those efforts came up empty.

Any forthcoming break in the case, according to the Sheriff’s Office, would likely come from the forensic side. Any future advances in forensic technology could be beneficial to the investigation. Pagliari declined to be more specific.

The girl’s parents, David and Barbara Spear, were out of town and unavailable for an interview. They have seldom spoken publicly about the case. Henshaw said he remains in contact with them.

When Henshaw was recruited to join the Cold Case Unit as a volunteer, Johnson drove him to the crime scene. Those who investigate old, unsolved cases often develop an attachment to the victims of those cases. Henshaw feels that connection with Spear. It started to form during that ride with Johnson years ago.

“He took me in his own car down to the crime scene and showed me where it was at,” Henshaw said. “We were hoping, and still are, that we will solve this case.”

Anyone with information about the Laralee Spear murder case is urged to call the Cold Case Unit at 386-254-1535.

202,Florida State sprinter Andre Ewers runs for history in title defense at ACC Championships,"CLOSE WATCH: Seminoles sprinter Andre Ewers discusses defending his title in the 100 and 200 at the ACC Outdoor Track & Field Championships. Rory Sharrock, Tallahassee Democrat

Florida State sprinter Andre Ewers is a household name within the track and field community.

His break-neck speed has propelled him to the top of the charts throughout his career.

Most recently, his top-rate honors include winning the 100, 200 and MVP at the 2018 ACC Outdoor Track & Field Championships.

All these attributes describe Ewers the athlete. However, it’s only part of the story.

The remaining portion which makes his half-glass full is his perseverance, strong work ethic and unshakable faith.

On Jan. 24, the Jamaican-born track star suffered a crippling hamstring injury. This ailment caused him to miss the ACC Indoor Track & Field Championships.

However, this pain was nothing compared to the emotions he felt on Feb. 9.

Two days before the ACC indoor meet in Blacksburg, Virginia, he received a phone call informing him his beloved grandfather, Noel ""Ta Ta"" Ewers, had died.

The bond between the two was more of a father-to-son relationship than a grandparent-grandchild connection. His grandfather raised him from a small child after his mother left Jamaica for the Virgin Islands.

The elder Ewers took his grandson everywhere he went throughout the parish of Saint Elizabeth. He instilled within him a can-do spirit and the intangibles of manhood.

""When I got the news, I didn't sleep for two days. Laying in my bed, I felt like I was on top of the ocean. I was cold and numb,"" Ewers said.

""He meant a lot to me. Watching him work hard and waking up at 6 a.m. showed me all about hard work. How a man should take care of his family. He cooked for me and took me to the doctor when I was sick. Everything a child wants, he did for me. I didn't have a father. I looked to him as that individual. He did everything completely from his heart.""

Time has since healed the sting from his physical and emotional wounds.

Now, Ewers is back to his elite form.

He's eager to successfully defend his titles this week at the ACC Outdoor Track & Field Championships at Lannigan Field in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Normally, the FSU senior races for school spirit and his son Aiden Ewers. However, this year, he's dedicating his races to his grandfather.

""I love my son and I'm always motivated by him to do great things. But I told myself I'm dedicating this season to my grandfather,"" Ewers said.

""I'm really excited and amped up because I didn't get to compete during the indoor meet. I had to renew my mind. A new mind gave me a new perspective on life. Me sitting out indoor was God transforming me into who I am. He was preparing me for what's to come. Now, it's up to me to go out and get that opportunity.""

Ewers' strong spiritual foundation helped him push through the adversity of his recovery period. While on the mend, he spent a lot of time in prayer and reading the Bible for positive reinforcement.

He frequently quotes Romans 8:28 which states: ""And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.""

With his mind, body and soul at full strength, Ewers lines up in the starter's block on a quest to make history.

In addition to helping FSU repeat as ACC men's champions, he's vying to become the first Seminole male sprinter to win the 100 and 200 two years in a row.

""Andre's chomping at the bit. It killed him to watch the team fight for the championship at indoor. He's healthy and he's gotten better every week,"" Florida State track and field head coach Bob Braman said.

""You've yet to see what you're going to see which is last year's Andre and then some. We've had some great sprinters like Walter Dix and Maurice Mitchell come through here. Nobody's won double-double twice. He' excited to etch his name on that one.""

As his time at FSU draws to a close, Ewers will prep for his pro career at the world championships. He also dreams of qualifying for the Summer Olympics in 2020.

His work ethic along with a strong-willed commitment is a driving force for his present and future endeavors.

""I remember when I came on my visit, on the cover of a book they gave me, it said 'leave your mark.' That is my whole mindset going into an ACC championship is to leave my mark,"" Ewers said.

203,Vietnam War mural pits residents vs. Florida community. Matter settled ... unhappily,"CLOSE The wreath placement and opening ceremony for the Vietnam and All Veterans Reunion at Wickham Park, Melbourne. Tim Shortt, FLORIDA TODAY

A skirmish between residents and management at a North Fort Myers development in Florida involving a memorial to the Vietnam War ended peacefully if not unhappily Tuesday.

The issue arose seemingly overnight when residents of the Del Tura Golf & Country Club began talking on social media sites about a mural on a garage door painted in black and depicting a Vietnam War-era soldier kneeling before a cross with a helicopter flying in the background.

Community officials sent Bob Masson, 71, a Vietnam War vet and the mural's owner, a letter asking him to remove the depiction. Apparently there also had been a complaint.

""It feels like I've been kicked in the head,"" Masson said. ""It feels like (his service in the war) meant nothing right now. It meant a lot to us when we were over there.""

Tuesday morning a group of residents gathered at the Del Tura clubhouse parking lot and started discussing the issue, which they said they thought was all about the military content of the mural.

Del Tura is a 55-and-over manufactured homes community on U.S. 41 in North Fort Myers.

""There's a lot of military veterans in here,"" Don Beavers, 60 and a veteran, said. ""It was on NextDoor and it just blew up yesterday. Everyone got involved last night.""

NextDoor is a social media site that developments such as Del Tura, gated communities and local communities can join to find out goings-on for their specific areas.

Richard Dzedzej, a resident at Del Tura, said the homeowner is a Vietnam veteran and was going to comply with the letter he received and paint over the picture.

""Other veterans told him that there is nothing wrong with it and to leave it intact,"" Dzedzej said.

Eventually Fred Taylor, the community manager, came out and addressed the residents.

""I'm happy to answer questions,"" Taylor told them. ""But not with the news present.""

Taylor told the group before moving inside the clubhouse that he was unaware they would be coming to meet with him with the news media present.

When questioned about the letter Taylor said Masson had not sought the proper approval despite community rules that disallow any mural on a garage door.

""I explained it is not the content of the graphic,"" Taylor said before asking the residents to meet with him in private. ""It is any graphic.""

Taylor pointed out that the community flies a POW flag on its main flagpole.

After the meeting the residents said they were satisfied but some were still a bit rankled that it was handled the way it was.

""I consider it unhappily settled,"" Dzedzej said. ""I understand the point but do think they could have let him keep it.""

Dzedzej's son Mike doesn't live at Del Tura but was visiting with his veteran dad and wasn't happy either.

""I think it's nonsense that he has to take it down,"" he said.

Masson, who has a flagpole with the POW and U.S. flags flying, and statues of military figures on his front lawn in basically the same configuration as the mural, said he put up the mural three months ago.

""I'm a military man all the way,"" Masson said. ""I'm just appalled that I have to take this off. It took them three months to send me the letter. But I see their point, they have a job to do.""

He said he was told he could keep the mural until Memorial Day and then replace it with a flag of the same topic or a plexiglass depiction and place it alongside the house. He said the brief battle won't prompt him to move.

""I have a lot of good friends, veterans, behind me 100 percent. I'm very disappointed,"" he said. ""But I'll get over it. ... I'll bite the bullet.""

""It's a beautiful thing,"" said Victor DiGrazia, 90, an Army veteran who saw action in the Korean War. ""I'll fight for this country till the day I die but the management is right. We have 1,300 residents here. What if someone wanted to put up a picture of a motorcycle?""

Take the time to listen: This World War II veteran has stories to share

After the meeting broke up Taylor declined to comment and referred questions to corporate offices of Hometown America Communities Corporation, owner of Del Tura and other communities in 12 states.

Attempts to reach company president and spokesman Stephen Braun were unsuccessful.

The 2019 Florida Historical Society Annual Meeting and Symposium is being held May 16-18 at the Radisson Resort at the Port in Cape Canaveral. The theme of the conference is “Countdown to History: Ice Age to the Space Age.”

Dozens of presenters from throughout the state and beyond will discuss a wide variety of topics related to Florida history and culture.

Glen Doran is a local hero to archaeology enthusiasts. In the mid-1980s, Doran was principal archaeologist for the Windover Dig, a world famous excavation that uncovered an ancient pond cemetery in north Brevard County.

Nearly 200 remarkably well preserved human burials were uncovered, that were between 7,000 and 8,000 years old. The bodies were wrapped in the oldest woven cloth found in North America, and 91 of the skulls contained intact brain matter.

Doran will open the FHS conference with the presentation “Windover and Beyond: 35 Years of Archaeology on the Space Coast.”

“I’m looking forward to being back in the area,” Doran said. “I’m sure that some of the people that worked on the Windover crew will be coming to the talk. One of the things that made this work particularly satisfying was the level of community involvement.”

Conference attendees will take a tour of the Brevard Museum of History and Natural Science in Cocoa, where artifacts from the Windover Dig are displayed.

They will also visit the Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore Cultural Complex in Mims, which includes a civil rights museum, a reflecting pool, and a replica of the Moore family home.

On Christmas night, 1951, a bomb exploded under the Moore’s home. The couple died from injuries sustained in the blast, making them the first martyrs of the contemporary civil rights movement. Harry T. Moore traveled throughout the state registering African Americans to vote.

“Harry Moore, of course, being an educated person, knew that power lay in the ballot box,” said Bill Gary, president of the Moore Cultural Complex. “If you cannot elect a person like yourself, then you try to use your voting power to vote for those persons who, at least, express some interest in your concerns.”

Gary’s work at the Moore Cultural Complex has earned him the Florida Historical Society’s Lifetime Achievement Award, which will be presented at the conference banquet dinner.

The 50th anniversary of the first manned mission to the moon is another focal point of the upcoming Florida Historical Society Annual Meeting and Symposium. Historian Lori Walters has spent decades documenting the impact of the space program on Brevard County. She will be moderating “A Conversation with Apollo-Era Space Workers” including Al Koller, Bill Heink, John Tribe, and Bill Waldren.

“Project Mercury is designed to get an American into space,” Walters said. “Then Project Gemini is there to provide all the links that we need to prove that a human being can survive fourteen days in a tin can orbiting the earth, we can rendezvous, we can do a spacewalk, and all these things that we have to prove to ultimately land a man on the moon. Running alongside that is Apollo.”

Much of the technology needed to complete a lunar mission did not exist when President John F. Kennedy declared in May 1961, that America would land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth before the end of the decade.

“Saturn 5 doesn’t exist yet,” Walters said. “The very craft that you need, the Apollo craft itself, and the booster, they don’t even exist yet.”

Local space workers would rise to the challenge, of course, and Kennedy’s vision was realized in July 1969, with five months to spare.

The FHS conference will include a tour of the Kennedy Space Center.

Former astronaut Winston Scott will help to commemorate the Apollo 11 moon landing with his keynote presentation “From the Cape into Space: The Adventures of a NASA Astronaut.”

“I remember sitting in front of my television watching those old grainy pictures, when Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon,” Scott recalled. “I was a freshman in college, and I can remember how exciting that was.”

The Florida State men's basketball team landed some much-needed big-man depth with the addition of Ole Miss graduate transfer center Dominik Olejniczak.

Olejniczak announced Sunday on his Instagram that he will be finishing his career with the Seminoles after he visited FSU earlier this week.

""Last college ride. Let's make it a good one,"" Olejniczak captioned the photo of him wearing an FSU jersey.

Stadium's Jeff Goodman ranked Olejniczak as the 39th-best available transfer this offseason in the Top 100 ranking he released in April.

The 7-foot-0, 260-pound center played the last two seasons for the Rebels after he began his career at Drake. In the 2018-19 season, he averaged 5.3 points and 3.0 rebounds over 18.3 points per game.

Olejniczak will make an instant impact for the Seminoles after they lost three big men -- center Christ Koumadje and forwards Phil Cofer and Mfiondu Kabengele -- off last year's team.

214,Florida man accused of bilking clients seeking pregnancy surrogates,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. — A Florida man faces charges in Maryland that he defrauded clients of a company that offered to help locate and financially support pregnancy surrogates for people trying to become parents.

Gregory Ray Blosser, 37, was arrested Monday in Florida on a wire fraud charge and detained until a Friday hearing in Miami, according to federal prosecutors.

Blosser has operated The Surrogacy Group since 2012, with offices in Annapolis, Maryland, and Tampa, Florida. Clients paid Blosser tens of thousands of dollars to find surrogates and support them during pregnancies. Blosser failed to either locate suitable surrogates or pay for their fees or medical expenses after clients deposited money into escrow accounts, a criminal complaint says.

""The victims were not able to obtain refunds, despite numerous attempts by phone and e-mail,"" a Justice Department press release says. ""Victims whose surrogates were not paid by Blosser had to pay the surrogates directly, even though they had provided funds to Blosser for that purpose.""

An assistant federal public defender who represented Blosser at his initial court appearance Tuesday didn't immediately respond to a telephone call seeking comment Friday.

Blosser's victims include seven clients from Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Australia and Germany who collectively paid Blosser approximately $200,000, according to an FBI agent's affidavit.

""The allegations in this case are especially egregious because they involve someone taking advantage of individuals who are trying to become parents,"" U.S. Attorney Robert Hur, of the District of Maryland, said in a statement. ""Criminals who line their pockets through such heartless deceit will be held accountable.""

Blosser also faces civil lawsuits in Maryland and Florida, including complaints filed by the attorney general's offices in both states.

An investigation by Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody's office concluded that The Surrogacy Group and Blosser collected approximately $270,000 from clients for services they didn't render.

""The Surrogacy Group and (Blosser) portray themselves as trusted guides, but for many they have betrayed this trust by taking tens of thousands of dollars and then abruptly stopping services or providing no services at all,"" the Florida complaint says.

On April 22, a circuit court judge in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order barring Blosser from selling surrogacy-related services in the state, according to state Attorney General Brian Frosh's office.

The FBI has set up a webpage to identify and contact other clients who may have been defrauded by Blosser and The Surrogacy Group.

A federal magistrate judge ordered Blosser released on $100,000 bond after his detention hearing Friday, according to a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Miami.

Blosser, a resident of Tampa, is expected to make his initial court appearance in Maryland on May 17. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted of the wire fraud charge.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190503/florida-man-accused-of-bilking-clients-seeking-pregnancy-surrogates?rssfeed=true,2019-05-03T15:58:17Z,Daytona Beach News,Florida Man,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

Andrew Ross Celaius, 37, is charged with aggravated child abuse and tampering with evidence.

According to deputies, the victim's mother brought the 2-year-old girl to the hospital after she thought she had ringworm. It turns out, deputies say, that the ring marks were burn marks.

Deputies searched Celaius's home and found several disturbing videos that showed the abuse the girl had endured. Authorities say one video showed Celaius wearing a werewolf mask during the abuse. The most disturbing video, according to the sheriff's office, is a video showing the child wearing a dog shock collar and hearing the child scream when the collar was triggered.

Eric Furnans, 36, was also arrested and charged with tampering with evidence. Deputies say that Celaius called Furnans from jail and asked him to destroy potentially damaging evidence.

218,"Florida man accused of stealing cruiser, leads to chase on turnpike","OKEECHOBEE COUNTY, Fla. - A 22-year-old Largo man is accused of stealing a cruiser and leading Florida troopers on a chase.

The Florida Highway Patrol said Shane Jensen has been charged with stealing a patrol car and reckless driving.

Investigators said around 4 p.m. a trooper saw Jensen who appeared to be medically distressed, along the Florida Turnpike in Okeechobee County.

This was on the northbound shoulder at the 181st mile marker.

Troopers said Jensen was sitting on the grass shoulder next to the trooper's cruiser.

When the trooper went to get Jensen water, he got up and stole the cruiser, according to FHP.

Highway patrol said the suspect reversed the cruiser and accelerated toward three troopers in an attempt to run them over.

Investigators said Jensen drove into Osceola County.

Troopers responded by deploying stop sticks, according to investigators.

Jensen avoided the sticks and drove on the grass median and stopped against a guardrail, according to highway patrol.

Troopers said he exited the vehicle and ran into the woods.

He was arrested and transported to a local hospital for treatment.

No troopers or civilians were injured in the incident, according to highway patrol.

223,Florida man on death row for murdering cellmate indicted in death of another cellmate,"A man who has already been sentenced to death for killing an inmate in July 2012 was indicted Thursday on charges connected to the death of another inmate at the Santa Rosa County Jail in January 2017.

The State Attorney's Office announced Thursday that Rocky Ali Beamon, 41, was indicted by a Santa Rosa County grand jury on a charge of first-degree premeditated murder.

The charge stems from a Jan. 22, 2017, incident where Beamon allegedly killed his cellmate, 27-year-old Nicholas Anderson.

Prosecutors say shortly after the midnight inmate count, Beamon bound Anderson and strangled him in their cell. He also allegedly used a homemade weapon to cut the man's neck.

The charge carries a penalty of either death or life in prison. The State Attorney's Office will make a decision on whether to seek the death penalty in the case within the next 30 days, according to a news release. Prosecutors previously told the News Journal the state intended to seek the death sentence in the case if a grand jury indicted Beamon.

Beamon was sentenced to death in January for a separate incident where he killed his cellmate at Apalachee Correctional Institution in Sneads on July 5, 2012. In that incident, Beamon watched the victim, Bruce Hunsicker, for several days to learn his schedule, and then killed him by choking him and stabbing him 80 times in the shower area of the prison dormitory with a homemade shank.

Beamon then rinsed himself off and flushed the shank, a towel and a pair of boxers before proceeding to dinner.

Beamon had been serving, and is still serving, a life sentence for murder in a 2005 case in Hillsborough County.

225,Skirmish at Florida community over a Vietnam War memorial mural settled ... unhappily,"A skirmish between residents and management at a North Fort Myers development in Florida involving a memorial to the Vietnam War ended peacefully if not unhappily Tuesday.

The issue arose seemingly overnight when residents of the Del Tura Golf & Country Club began talking on social media sites about a mural on a garage door painted in black and depicting a Vietnam War-era soldier kneeling before a cross with a helicopter flying in the background.

Community officials sent Bob Masson, 71, a Vietnam War vet and the mural's owner, a letter asking him to remove the depiction. Apparently there also had been a complaint.

""It feels like I've been kicked in the head,"" Masson said. ""It feels like (his service in the war) meant nothing right now. It meant a lot to us when we were over there.""

Tuesday morning a group of residents gathered at the Del Tura clubhouse parking lot and started discussing the issue, which they said they thought was all about the military content of the mural.

Del Tura is a 55-and-over manufactured homes community on U.S. 41 in North Fort Myers.

""There's a lot of military veterans in here,"" Don Beavers, 60 and a veteran, said. ""It was on NextDoor and it just blew up yesterday. Everyone got involved last night.""

NextDoor is a social media site that developments such as Del Tura, gated communities and local communities can join to find out goings-on for their specific areas.

Richard Dzedzej, a resident at Del Tura, said the homeowner is a Vietnam veteran and was going to comply with the letter he received and paint over the picture.

""Other veterans told him that there is nothing wrong with it and to leave it intact,"" Dzedzej said.

Eventually Fred Taylor, the community manager, came out and addressed the residents.

""I'm happy to answer questions,"" Taylor told them. ""But not with the news present.""

Taylor told the group before moving inside the clubhouse that he was unaware they would be coming to meet with him with the news media present.

When questioned about the letter Taylor said Masson had not sought the proper approval despite community rules that disallow any mural on a garage door.

""I explained it is not the content of the graphic,"" Taylor said before asking the residents to meet with him in private. ""It is any graphic.""

Taylor pointed out that the community flies a POW flag on its main flagpole.

After the meeting the residents said they were satisfied but some were still a bit rankled that it was handled the way it was.

""I consider it unhappily settled,"" Dzedzej said. ""I understand the point but do think they could have let him keep it.""

Dzedzej's son Mike doesn't live at Del Tura but was visiting with his veteran dad and wasn't happy either.

""I think it's nonsense that he has to take it down,"" he said.

Masson, who has a flagpole with the POW and U.S. flags flying, and statues of military figures on his front lawn in basically the same configuration as the mural, said he put up the mural three months ago.

""I'm a military man all the way,"" Masson said. ""I'm just appalled that I have to take this off. It took them three months to send me the letter. But I see their point, they have a job to do.""

He said he was told he could keep the mural until Memorial Day and then replace it with a flag of the same topic or a plexiglass depiction and place it alongside the house. He said the brief battle won't prompt him to move.

""I have a lot of good friends, veterans, behind me 100 percent. I'm very disappointed,"" he said. ""But I'll get over it. ... I'll bite the bullet.""

""It's a beautiful thing,"" said Victor DiGrazia, 90, an Army veteran who saw action in the Korean War. ""I'll fight for this country till the day I die but the management is right. We have 1,300 residents here. What if someone wanted to put up a picture of a motorcycle?""

After the meeting broke up Taylor declined to comment and referred questions to corporate offices of Hometown America Communities Corporation, owner of Del Tura and other communities in 12 states.

Attempts to reach company president and spokesman Stephen Braun were unsuccessful.

226,Inside South Florida: Steve’s New Comic Book Is Aoki-Dokie,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

DJ, music producer and now comic book creator Steve Aoki, stopped by Multiverse Corps Comics in Miami to greet fans and sign his new comic book, “Neon Future”

“Neon Future” is set 30 years from now, in response to a global crisis, the U.S government has made all advanced technology illegal.

Now, there’s a war between the augmented who have integrated technology into their bodies and the authentic who have not.

With a story so innovative and compelling about unchecked fear, I had to ask Steve about the inspiration behind ""Neon Future"".

""I'm obsessed with the idea of technology and our humanity coming together and augmenting ourselves with technology. Plus I mean I was a comic book kid so when I was a teenager, even before I got into music I was a comic book junkie. It all started with building out my concept in music and doing all of my album series called 'Neon Future' and then incorporating on there and teaming up with people that feel the same way that know how to put something like this together,"" said Aoki.

We asked him how ""Neon Future"" was different from other comic books today.

""In 'Neon Future' technology in this case isn't the bad guy, I think in the future as we progress, we are gonna use technology to benefit out lives and there's gonna be a point in time where someone won't want us to be superhuman and then that becomes a rebellion. The augmented are the saving grace of the human species when the government stops us from living our lives,"" said Aoki.

Steve’s story came to life thanks to Impact Theory. The studio is behind publishing ""Neon Future"". Steve partnered up with Co-Founder of impact theory Tom Bilyeu and writer Jim Krueger.

So we heard that talk came about after Tom found out that Steve was planning on getting cryogenically frozen.

""That is literally a true story, the man wants to be cryogenically frozen when he dies and I thought that's amazing, somebody that has that optimism for the future in general and for technology specifically so yes we hit it off on that. I'm a super techno optimist and I really believe that technology is going to be the thing that allows us to push society forward, but there is gonna be what we call trough of despair so we wanted to pick up a story that started in that trough of despair that typical dystopian future. We wanted to show people a path out of that so rather than being this sort of bleak story, Steve and I come in together and share that optimism and wanting to tell a story that ultimately is empowering about rising up out of that and what that would look like,"" said Bilyeu.

Since ""Neon Future"" is a story about survival in an advanced technological world, I had to ask Tom to give us his advice for us millennials surviving in this modern world.

""I would say that humans are the ultimate adaptation machine, the most important thing to understand is what humans are designed to do from the ground up is change, grow and get better. So no matter who you are today, don't worry about that, it's just a question on who you want to become and what's the price you're willing to pay to get there because standing between where you are today and what you want to accomplish in your life is a set of skills, that's it. You don't need school to acquire those skills, you're gonna need a lot of hard work and willingness to fail, willingness to grow and learn from so you need that mindset. So it really is possible,"" said Bilyeu.

237,Authorities: Florida man used shock collar to torture 2-year-old girl,"Pictures and videos were found of the man intentionally burning the young girl with a lighter, among other egregious acts.

An Escambia County man was arrested Wednesday under suspicion of using multiple methods of torture to abuse a 2-year-old girl, according to the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, faces multiple charges of aggravated child abuse, child abuse, tampering with evidence and several drug-related charges.

Authorities were alerted about possible abuse by doctors who identified burn marks around the girl’s neck. The toddler was taken to the hospital by her mother, who claimed her daughter had ringworm, the sheriff’s office said.

Investigators searched Celaius’ home and found videos and pictures of Celaius intentionally burning the young girl with a lighter, shooting her with an airsoft gun, hitting her with a bottle and scaring her with a werewolf mask.

However, it was a video displaying Celaius harming the girl with a shock collar — described as a tazing collar for dogs, that deputies found as most egregious, according to deputies.

Investigators also found videos of torture on cloud storage, and they are still looking into what the videos may have been used for.

The mother was also arrested for neglect, but was bonded out of jail. Deputies believe she was unaware of the extent of the abuse. She is fully cooperating with the investigation, according to deputies.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190503/authorities-florida-man-used-shock-collar-to-torture-2-year-old-girl?rssfeed=true,2019-05-03T08:15:40Z,The Ledger,Florida Man,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - A Florida man has been sentenced to a year in prison for his part in a reptile smuggling ring that stretched from South Carolina to Hong Kong.

The State reports Matthew Harrison Kail was sentenced Tuesday for the scheme that involved hiding rare turtles in candy wrappers or socks and shipping them overseas.

Prosecutors said Kail was a key part of the operation, which was led in South Carolina by Steven Verren Baker. Baker, of Georgia, was ordered in March to serve just over a year in prison. Authorities have said Baker's one of South Carolina's most well-known wildlife traders.

The newspaper says these are believed to be the state's first prison sentences for illegal wildlife trading. Several other people in the scheme have been sentenced to probation and fines.",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-man-gets-prison-for-smuggling-turtles-in-candy-wrappers/1972890989,2019-05-02T12:08:16Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

251,Judge: Public defender must represent Florida school shooting suspect,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A judge ruled that the public defender must continue representing the man charged in last year's Florida high school massacre because he is unlikely to obtain a large inheritance left by his mother.

Judge Elizabeth Scherer ruled Friday that Broward County public defenders must represent 20-year-old Nikolas Cruz.

The office recently asked to be removed from the case because the former Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student could receive $432,000 before taxes from his late mother's annuity. Under state law, the office can only represent indigent defendants.

Scherer ruled Cruz hasn't applied for the money and if he did, it would likely be claimed through lawsuits filed by his victims' families.

Cruz's attorneys say he would plead guilty to killing 17 for a life sentence. Prosecutors want the death penalty.

252,eBay-DirecTV discount scheme hits Central Florida,"Impostors claiming to represent DirecTV have launched a premium channel discount scam in exchange for eBAY gift cards.



Glen and Barbara Boschen of Lake County, told News 6 they received a text that announced an eBay-DirecTV promotion that offered a 50 percent discount on the premium channel package.



Boschen, who has been a DirecTV customer since October 2018, was told to get $600 in EBAY gift cards and call the man, who gave her the name of Brian, with the card codes.



“He convinced me he was an agent of AT&T,” Boschen said. “He said, 'You’re going to get all the movie channels.'”



After three days of service, Boschen discovered a glitch in his new discount deal: These was no signal.



When he called what he thought was the AT&T DirecTV service center, Boschen was told his eBAY gift cards did not go through and he would have to get another $600 to activate the service and the 50 percent discount.



News 6 called the number: 855- 257-2188.



We were surprised to hear a recorded greeting by a professional announcer: “Thank you for calling AT&T DirecTV.”



Once we talked to the manager handling Boschen’s account, it was clear it was a deception.



The so-called agent claimed to be operating for AT&T in a Baltimore, Maryland, call center. Dozens of people could be heard speaking in the background.



News 6 asked to speak to an eBay representative because there was no evidence of a joint promotion between the two companies.



Officicials with eBAY never called.



Both AT&T and Boschen’s local provider, CenturyLink, confirmed there is no special promotion involving gift cards.



CenturyLink’s issues manager, Mark Molzen, said in part, “We do not currently have any promotions with eBay and we do not ask for payment via gift cards; what you’ve described is a scam. Our promotional offerings are available on our website and we encourage customers with any questions or concerns about promotions to call CenturyLink. “



In the past, similar schemes have used Amazon as the bogus promotion partner with DirecTV and AT&T.



AT&T is aware of the scam and has provided information online to avoid any issues.



The Federal Trade Commission has information on its website regarding scammers requesting to be paid with gift cards, click here for more information.

253,Horror film 'Crawl' depicts fictional Florida Cat. 5 hurricane — plus gators,"""Crawl,"" directed by Alexandre Aha, will be in theaters on July 12.

PANAMA CITY — A little less than a year after an actual Category 5 hurricane hit Florida, a horror movie is coming to theaters this summer about a fictional Cat 5 hitting Florida and unleashing man-eating alligators on those that didn't evacuate.

""Crawl,"" directed by Alexandre Aha, will be in theaters on July 12. The trailer for the film was released Thursday.

In the trailer, the governor is seen warning residents to leave because rescue workers won't be able to help them. Haley (Kaya Scoledario) ignores the orders to search for her father (Barry Pepper), whom she finds injured and trapped in the family crawl space. The pair become trapped by rising waters, and then by man-eating alligators.

First responders are seen trying to reach them, only to be attacked by the alligators themselves.

In October, Hurricane Michael hit the Panhandle of Florida as a Category 5 storm, the first to hit the U.S. since 1992. Forty-nine people died as a result of the storm, and thousands were rendered homeless. Many residents feel forgotten by the rest of the country.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man has been convicted of leaving threatening voicemails for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Court records show that a federal jury in Orlando found 57-year-old Robert Francis Pratersch guilty Tuesday of threatening a federal official and interstate transmission of a threat to injure. He faces up to 15 years in prison at a July 16 sentencing.

Federal prosecutors say Pratersch left three profanity-laced, anti-Semitic voicemail messages last fall at Sanders’s office in Burlington, Vermont. Authorities say Pratersch threatened to behead Sanders, “ISIS-style,” and videotape the execution. The remark was a reference to the Islamic State militant group.

Pratersch was indicted by a federal grand jury in February and arrested later that month in St. Cloud, Florida.

ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA ) - A man who allegedly live-streamed a shootout between himself and Florida deputies, after having earlier dragged his wife from a car by her hair, asked a judge to drop all charges, saying the fracas was all part of a sexual adventure between he and his wife.

270,Florida deputy fired after off-duty fight at Jacksonville hotel,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Brevard County Sheriff's Office deputy was fired after being involved in an altercation while off duty in February at a Jacksonville hotel.

According to an internal affairs report from the Sheriff's Office that was obtained by News4Jax on Tuesday, then-Deputy Jason Allen Roberts and his fiancée were staying at the Lexington Hotel on Jacksonville's Southbank. The report said they met an unnamed man who was also staying there and all three drank into the night before returning to their rooms about 4:30 a.m. March 17. The report said Roberts got mad when his fiancée went into the other man's bathroom and he started banging and kicking the door, breaking it. The other man tried to defuse the situation, according to the report, but Roberts punched him in the face, knocking out a tooth. The fiancée came out of the bathroom, Roberts pinned her to the floor, the other man again tried to intervene and Roberts knocked him down to the floor and pinned him, the report said. That’s when the other man pulled a gun from his pocket and shot Roberts, according to the report. The Sheriff's Office said he was injured in the shooting.

The state attorney’s office called it self-defense. The state attorney's office considered charging Roberts with battery, but did not. He was fired.

The man who shot him was questioned and released. He was not charged.

According to the Sheriff's Office, Roberts had been disciplined a number of times, dating back to 2011, including for an unsafe pursuit, failing to respond to a text alert about a shooting, being intoxicated and unprofessional toward first responders while off duty, missing a deposition in a case that led to charges being dropped and not filing a response-to-resistance report after he injured a woman while making a prostitution arrest.

That name matches what public records show about who lived at this home. Bender worked as a realtor for Remax. She lives one street over and she was supposed to host an open house at this home yesterday morning from 11 to 2 and when she didn't show up, that's when people started making calls.

The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office responded Saturday afternoon to investigate the suspicious deaths of a man and woman at 203 Southern Oak Drive in Nocatee.

Neighbor said their neighbor called her boss who called her family member who then came to check on her and found her and a man dead inside.

The St Johns County Sheriff's office has not released the details involving how the two died or the relationship. But the Clerk of Courts website shows Bender had filed a petition for an injunction against a man named Simon Hanley in December 2018. The injunction was filed against stalking violence.

Neighbors say they saw an odd man in the past at her home.

""She had taken out a restraining order against someone and the particular person was the one that I know now was odd and we should've cautioned her against spending time with him but she had a big heart and she couldn't help but want to help others,"" said neighbor Jane Amorim.

Neighbors say it was a rough night for them and people are torn up about this.

People are posting on facebook that she was a really sweet person and sending prayers to her loved ones.

Ramerio Main is facing numerous charges, from allegedly assaulting a police officer to fleeing and eluding.It all started with a search for a ""serial shoplifter"" that had police in more than a half-dozen local cities trying to track down the thief targeting one store brand.Police said Main has been ""running"" from them for two weeks, so it's no surprise his many arrest affidavits show he's allegedly been targeting high-end Nike and other brand shoes at Bealls retail clothing stores across the region. In fact, New Smyrna Beach police say he targeted a store on 3rd Avenue three times.Last week, an officer spotted Main and attempted to pull his car over.He was charged with aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer.When he showed up at a Bealls in Orange City on Monday, store employees called police, who arrested him.Detectives said they have surveillance video from the stores that shows that every time Main would come outside with boxes in his arms, he would walk to a vehicle in which the trunk was popped open, and a woman was behind the wheel. He'd allegedly throw the boxes in, jump in the passenger seat and the pair would take off.Jamie Lynn Robert is the registered owner of what police call the getaway car, and was arrested on outstanding warrants unrelated to the case.The sedan, they say, shows up in multiple thefts.But with detectives reviewing evidence from stores in New Smyrna Beach, Orange City, Port Orange, Daytona Beach, Edgewater, Palm Coast and Leesburg, they said they expect to connect Main and Robert to some of the same crimes.Main is being held under no bond on an outstanding warrant from Missouri. Main will have a first appearance at the Volusia County Jail on Wednesday in connection with the Daytona Beach thefts.",https://www.wesh.com/article/man-arrested-accused-of-shoplifting-from-places-all-over-central-florida/27327234,2019-05-01T00:13:00Z,WESH-TV,Florida Man,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789

The baby was born with the same disabilities as the teenager, according to the girl’s family. They said the teenager does not understand her relation to the baby.

Carlos Carrizales, 61, was sentenced Monday to life in prison. He was convicted last month of felonies including incest, Lakeland’s The Ledger reported. It was not immediately clear what Carrizales' relationship to the teen was.

The non-verbal teenager carried out the pregnancy and gave birth to her daughter in early 2017. Carrizales was arrested that November.

Investigators discovered the girl's pregnancy in 2016 and subsequent DNA testing led authorities to Carrizales. DNA tests showed he was 99.99 percent likely to be the baby's father. Assistant State Attorney Lauren Randall said two independent tests had the same result.

Jonathan William Chapman, 45, was under the influence of alcohol and refused to leave the library despite multiple requests from library staff that he go, according to the report.

When police arrived, Chapman gave them the name “Jason Bourne,” the titular character of Robert Ludlum’s best-selling book series, and a phony Social Security number, the report said.

Once police figured out Chapman’s actual identity, the 45-year-old man was taken into custody on a first-degree misdemeanor charge of resisting an officer without violence.

Kyle Rohrig is an avid hiker and his Shiba Inu named Katana usually accompanies him. She's easily logged 30 miles a day on their past trails, but when Japanese hunting dog lost both eyes to Glaucoma two months before the trek, he worried how she would fare on the trail.

Along with a friend, they headed north on the trail from Big Cypress near Miami in January and finished April 1 at Fort Pickens near Pensacola.

The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports Rohrig hoisted the 21-pound Katana onto his backpack when they approached deep swampy areas and treacherous spots. He estimates he carried her for more than 800 miles.

Last week, “in response to citizen requests, our deputies conducted a speed enforcement operation in Golden Gate Estates,” the Collier County Sheriff’s Office wrote on Facebook.

But after a steady stream of traffic, they were left confused. They’d only pulled over one driver for speeding.

When the deputies left the area, the community apparently not being the speed demons they’d been painted as, everything made sense.

Another Florida Man tale: This Florida man is the greatest investor you've never heard of

Located about a quarter mile from the speed trap, sat a piece of plywood propped up against a 45 mph speed limit sign. “POLICE AHEAD” the sign warned in bright red paint.

What’s left for the Florida deputies to say but “Well played, Anonymous Sign Artist. Well played.” And that’s exactly what they did.

302,Orange County man back behind bars after peeking inside teen's bedroom,"An Orange County man previously accused of peeking inside of a teenager's bedroom window is now back behind bars on new voyeurism charges.

Deputies arrested Thai Williams, 18, Friday after investigators said a neighbor's home surveillance camera caught him on video looking into a girl's bedroom while using a flashlight last Thursday and Friday morning.

The latest alleged victim did not want to be identified, but she told News 6 that Williams is her former classmate from school and his allegations are concerning.

""Not knowing exactly when or what time he was looking at me, if it was while I was getting ready, or while I didn’t have any clothes on,"" the victim said. ""I wouldn’t wish this upon anyone.""

The alleged victim told us she's still trying to recover from the scare.

""I feel uncomfortable now, myself to get ready in my room, to get ready anywhere, and I’m just very cautious about what I do now,"" she said. ""I never thought this would happen to me now, but it did, and it can happen to anyone.""

Williams faced a jail judge over the weekend in Orange County. She granted him no bond and revoked his bond based on his previous voyeurism charges earlier this year.

Court records show Williams was arrested back in February on similar allegations.

Deputies said video cameras caught Williams on at least six different occasions, from August of 2018 to February 2019, peeking inside of a different former classmate’s bedroom window in a separate Orange County neighborhood. In one case, a neighbor told deputies he saw Williams using a ladder to peek inside of the girl's bedroom, records show.

The latest alleged victim said she hopes Williams remains in jail on no bond.

""All around I hope that he gets the help that he needs because I don’t want any of this to happen again to any other girl.""

Williams remains locked up in the Orange County Jail on a new charge of voyeurism among other charges.

307,Worried about plastic bag and straw waste? Florida lawmakers aren't | Rangel,"Straw man (Photo: by Nathan Archer)

We've all seen the images of discarded plastic mucking up our beaches and endangering sea life — animals caught up in plastic bags, or the disturbing video of researchers extracting a plastic straw from a turtle's nostril. You'd think that would drive our coastal state to action.

Well, it did. Just not the action you might expect.

This week, the Legislature passed a bill that prohibits counties and municipalities from banning plastic straws for five years while the state studies “each ordinance or regulation adopted” by some 10 cities across the state. The bill is headed to Gov. Ron DeSantis' desk.

A decade ago, convinced by large retailers, lawmakers prohibited local regulations on the use of retail plastic bags. The law mandated the Department of Environmental Protection study the need for such regulations and give its recommendations to lawmakers by February 2010. Nine years have passed and lawmakers never revisited the issue. Several bills to repeal the law have failed, including one filed this year.

More: Lawmakers block plastic straw bans in Florida

Why are plastic bags and straws so dear to our lawmakers?

Of course, there's the understandable concern about how bans impact businesses. But the cynic in me says perhaps the answer is in the political influence of the Florida Retail Federation and the Associated Industries of Florida, the largest organizations that oppose plastic bans. It's a lot easier for lobbyists who who often organize fundraisers for lawmakers to push for a statewide preemption than to try to stop every local ban.

It seems special interests have seen the writing on the wall as several municipalities have passed straw bans since last year — including Fort Myers Beach, Sanibel Island, Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale — so they are getting ahead of the game before other local governments get on board. No Space Coast communities have passed such ordinances, but Satellite Beach passed a resolution to encourage businesses and residents to stop using straws last year.

Plastic bags can last more than 1,000 years and be mistaken for food by marine animals. They were the fifth most frequently found item during coastal cleanups worldwide and straws were the seventh, accounting for more than 2 million pieces collected in 2017, according to the International Coastal Cleanup Report by the Ocean Conservancy.

Leave it up to local communities

Barista Natalie Duffield (right), of Port St. Lucie, hands a glass of fresh-brewed iced tea — served with a glass straw — to Karen Knott, of Jensen Beach, at Gilbert's Coffee Bar overlooking the south fork of the St. Lucie River on Thursday, April 18, 2019, in Stuart. Gilbert's was designated as ""ocean friendly"" by the Surfrider Foundation for their commitment to reducing plastic waste and eliminating use of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam. Business owner Abigail Rogan said, ""For me, starting my first small business in our town and being a waterfront town, every little choice I make for Gilbert's and our brand is intentional."" (Photo: XAVIER MASCAREÑAS/TCPALM)

I'm not arguing for a total ban on plastic straws and plastic bags. We shouldn't go cold-turkey as we transition into a world of less plastic waste. But the Legislature's move follows a pattern of bills that take local governments' ability to shape their communities and make decision for themselves away. By tying their hands, Tallahassee has stifled any creative, middle-ground approach to this issue. Who knows best what the 10 cities that passed bans need? A lawmaker who's never visited that community or officials who live in it?

Lawmakers also did not take into consideration the public input that went into crafting local ordinances already in place. Sanibel Island, for example, passed a ban last year after more than 10 businesses were on board with not using plastic straws.

Of course, we can't deny that telling businesses they can't use certain products can increase costs.

Open Mike's in Melbourne has used paper straws since 2012. Owner Mike Della Cioppa said he pays $80 for 4,000 paper straws versus $15 for 3,000 plastic ones. He said although the cost is ""ridiculous,"" most customers refuse straws anyway.

But other businesses have found ways to lower that cost, and there are many environmental organizations willing to help. Nomad Cafe in downtown Melbourne has only used compostable paper straws and containers upon request since it opened in 2011. Owner Megan Gonzalez said she gets them at an affordable cost from a paper company through her affiliation with Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit that works to protect oceans and beaches and a big proponent of straw bans.

Gonzalez said she's not fully on board with bans because she fears businesses would stop offering even paper straws to avoid extra costs. That means seniors and people with disabilities who can't hold their beverage would have no options. Some people with disabilities also say paper straws disintegrate too quickly.

Better solutions would be to phase out straw use and have exceptions. That's exactly what some Florida cities have already done. Sanibel Island's ordinance exempts people with disabilities. St. Petersburg has a phase-out approach: straws are allowed by customer request this year and next year will be completely banned.

Luckily, despite the Legislature's action, many restaurants are already forgoing plastic straws on their own. Virtually all Satellite Beach restaurants, with the exception of chains, are doing so, according to City Manager Courtney Barker.

It's too bad our lawmakers lack the same vision and trust in our local governments' ability to make decisions for themselves.

310,From Denzel Washington to Joe Pesci: What movies were filmed in Southwest Florida?,"Denzel Washington spent time here. So did Ernest Borgnine and Sean Connery and Jane Mansfield, to name a few.

From the Everglades to Boca Grande, Southwest Florida has served as a scenic and steamy backdrop for movies for more than a half century.

Here's a rundown of movies that include the Paradise Coast in their backdrop, from an entire film to glimpses in a scene or two.

""Adaptation"" (2006) — Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park figured prominently in the movie based on Susan Orlean's non-fiction book ""The Orchid Thief"" and a screenwriter's experience trying to adapt the book into a screenplay while suffering from writer's block.

Kyle Rohrig is an avid hiker and his Shiba Inu named Katana usually accompanies him. She's easily logged 30 miles a day on their past trails, but when the Japanese hunting dog lost both eyes to glaucoma two months before the trek, he worried how she would fare on the trail.

Along with a friend, they headed north on the trail from Big Cypress near Miami in January and finished April 1 at Fort Pickens near Pensacola.

The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports Rohrig hoisted the 21-pound Katana onto his backpack when they approached deep swampy areas and treacherous spots. He estimates he carried her for more than 800 miles.

Ficken filed a lawsuit against the city seeking a nominal $1 in damages, relief from fines and an end to the city’s practice of fining people without considering ability to pay.

Last summer, Ficken says he was away for lengthy periods managing the estate of his deceased mother in South Carolina. Ficken says the man paid to mow his lawn then died unexpectedly.

333,Man charged in fatal shooting outside nightclub extradited to Orlando,"ORLANDO, Fla. - The extradition of a man charged with the death of a 22-year-old man at a downtown Orlando nightclub in January has brought a sense of relief for the family of the victim.

Notier Misael Gomez, 27, is charged with first-degree murder with a firearm and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm in connection with the death of Keveon Smith.

Surveillance video from the morning of Jan. 26 showed Smith in the parking lot of Club Lit with a group of people.

The video showed a man walking up to Smith and hitting him on the head and then three men shooting toward him as he tried to run away.

Smith died at an area hospital. Two other people suffered injuries as a result of the shooting, according to Orlando police.

The Rev. James Morris is the pastor for the family and a friend. He continues to check in with Smith's parents since his death.

""When I talked to Keveon's mom, she says, 'Isn't this something? It's the day before Mother's Day,' and I said, 'It is something,'"" Morris said.

After months of investigation, federal agents tracked down Gomez in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in April. He was extradited to Orlando on Friday.

""That arrest and that extradition says we are not going to let this die. This will not be another cold case file,"" Morris said.

Morris said the fight isn't over. Three people were seen shooting in the surveillance video, but there's only been one arrest.

""This should say to people, time out for it, because we're going to get you,"" Smith said.

Gomez went before a judge Saturday morning and was given no bond.

Officials have not said what role Gomez allegedly played in the shooting or if additional suspects are being sought.

Amid a crowd of nearly 10,000 people at a Southwest Florida university's spring commencement ceremony, two parents hoisted a Venezuelan flag above their heads as their daughter waved and fist-pumped across the stage.

It was a reminder of the country they'd left behind so Fabiana Solano and her siblings could have a better life.

The 21-year-old became the first person in her family to graduate from a university Saturday morning. She was one of 1,717 students graduating from Florida Gulf Coast University, the largest commencement in the university's history.

""I am grateful to have the life I do have now, because I wouldn't have had it if my parents hadn't decided to leave everything behind,"" Solano said the day before the ceremony. ""That's why I love school so much. There are a lot of college students fighting for their rights to study and learn in Venezuela.""

Fabiana Solano graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University Saturday after just three years of school. She moved from Venezuela when she was seven and didn't speak a word of English. She'll graduate from the Honor's College with a 3.8 GPA. She is part of the marketing team at the university and has a life size cutout at the welcome center that promotes the university. (Photo: Andrew West/The News-Press USA Today Network-Florida, The News-Press)

Solano was 7 years old when her mom and dad moved the family to the United States.

She said she can remember at least two times they were held up at gunpoint in Venezuela: once with her mom at a bank, the other when a driver hit her dad's car while he was taking her to school. She said she had to hide under the seat so the man with the gun wouldn't see her.

No one intervened because they were afraid for their own lives, she said.

And when she was 5, her dad taught her not to look assailants in the face if they ever pointed a gun at her.

""If you haven't seen their face, they might let you go,"" Solano explained. ""Learning that at 5 years old is pretty scary.""

The family's voyage to the U.S. was perilous, even with her dad having U.S. citizenship. At times, they had to wait for more than a day inside a building with no bathrooms just to get a passport, she said.

Once they got to Fort Lauderdale, life got better. They had great Christmases, Solano said. They visited Disney each year for her birthday.

But it wasn't without adversity. Just before she turned 16, her father fell two stories from a ladder onto a marble floor and injured his back. Her mom was cleaning houses at the time, and struggled to sustain the family on that income alone, Solano said.

She started taking her classes seriously in high school, receiving the highest scores on Advanced Placement exams and entering FGCU with 17 college credits. She's managed to put herself through school on scholarships alone in only three years.

Solano, an Honor's College Student, is graduating with a 3.8 overall grade point average and a 4.0 GPA in her major. She is a Florida Public Relations Association member and an Award of Distinction winner.

She started out as a nursing student, but quickly realized it wasn't the right fit. She found her way into the college of communications organically, by posting videos of her college experience on social media that got her noticed by marketing and communications staff.

From there, her experience in public relations and marketing soared. She started managing a university Instagram account. She became a student photographer, a brand ambassador for the college, and appeared in promotional videos that would encourage prospective students to apply and enroll at FGCU.

She also served as an FGCU spokesperson, a role she said is the first of its kind.

She became a tremendous asset to the university's marketing team, said Deborah Wiltrout, FGCU's associate vice president of marketing and communications.

""We realized we were thinking along the same lines,"" Wiltrout said. ""She had a lot of confidence in front of the camera and a real passion for the institution, and she was able to get involved in a lot of different aspects of things we do around the department.""

And she helped with grassroots marketing to launch an augmented reality program that uses an app on a smartphone to scan images in a brochure and make them come to life in a video on the phone's screen.

""She added a lot of value to that in the way she asked the questions, and her comfort with the students,"" Wiltrout said. ""She's a student we turn to pretty often. She's really good, she's smart, she relates to the camera and she really gets what we're trying to do and the institution.""

Wiltrout said Solano was headed in the marketing direction before the team developed a relationship with her. She thinks the partnership helped seal the deal that this is what Solano really wants to do, she said.

""We have seen her grow in the role and get even better at what she does,"" Wiltrout said.

And her plan after she graduates?

More school, Solano said.

Solano will pursue a master's degree in public administration at FGCU for the next two years, and hopes to go into local government in the future.

""I love working with people, talking to people and I love helping people,"" Solano said. ""FGCU has definitely helped me envision what my future is going to look like.""

And it's helped her to see the importance of taking advantage of every opportunity that comes her way, she said.

""People take a lot of things for granted, like being able to get an education,"" she said. ""I don't take anything for granted. I can't.""

341,"Florida mom credits flight crew, passengers with saving baby's life during seizure","Instagram photo courtesy: Janay Flowers Instagram photo courtesy: Janay Flowers

- High up in the clouds, a mother had a terrifying experience when her baby had seizure during their flight from Tampa to Dallas.

On April 25, Janay Flowers departed from Tampa International Airport on American Airlines Flight 607 with her 11-month-old daughter, Nevaeh. Ten minutes before landing in Dallas, Nevaeh spiked a fever and had a febrile seizure. Flowers told FOX 13 she didn’t know if her daughter would survive.

“I started to freak out,” she recalled. “I can’t believe this is happening – not my baby. This can’t be happening.”

Flowers started screaming out for help. That’s when several passengers – including a nurse – and flight attendant rushed to help. The nurse, named Tiffany, turned Naveah on her side and pulled her tongue out of her mouth to clear her airway. A second passenger, Alvin, assisted.

""All of these people worked diligently to cool my baby down while she was having a seizure,"" she wrote in an Instagram post. ""One man went to the front of the plane to ensure that the EMS was at the gate as soon as we landed. Another man got an oxygen tank and administered it to Nevaeh. Another man was taking her pulse. As soon as our plane landed, we all rushed to the front of the plane while they grabbed all of my belongings. One man carried my baby, one man kept thumping her foot to make her cry.""

Flowers said she felt helpless as she watched but tried to comfort her daughter by singing, “You Are My Sunshine,” until they finally landed and paramedics took over. Later, Flowers said she learned Naveah had stopped breathing and had a temperature of 104 degrees. Prior to the incident, she said her baby never had a seizure.

Doctors said Naveah appears to be healthy and there were no underlying issues, Flowers explained.

“I literally don’t have the words for all the emotions I was feeling…all of the emotions I am feeling now,” she said. “I’m so grateful she is still here. I know it’s God that she is still here. He put everybody into place to help me save this baby.”

Flowers managed to make contact with Tiffany and Alvin through Facetime, and invited them to attend Naveah’s first birthday party next month.",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/florida-mom-credits-flight-crew-passengers-in-saving-baby-s-life-during-seizure,2019-04-30T15:22:09Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Florida Man,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609

NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Pasco County woman is facing charges after deputies say she assaulted a man in an attempt to sober him up.

Pasco deputies were called a home on Hummingbird Lane in New Port Richey just before 1 a.m. Sunday and arrested 39-year-old Amber Lynnee Grace.

According to an arrest report, Grace slapped the victim in the face during an argument inside the home. The victim told deputies he then walked away from Grace and went to his bedroom.

Deputies say the victim later woke up and found Grace standing over him with a kitchen knife raised above her head. Grace then stabbed the bed with the knife, the arrest report says.

The victim told deputies he was scared he was going to be stabbed by Grace. A responding deputy noted in the arrest report that there was a slice in the bedsheets just inches away from the pillow where the victim's head was.

The arrest report says Grace admitted to slapping the man in the face and said she did it because he was drunk and thought it would help his intoxication level. Deputies say she also admitted to stabbing the bed to ""shock"" the victim.

Grace was arrested and charged with domestic aggravated assault and domestic battery.",https://www.wfla.com/news/pasco-county/deputies-florida-woman-slapped-man-stabbed-mattress-to-try-and-sober-him-up/1963528137,2019-04-29T15:58:12Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
346,100-year-old Florida man dies in crash after drivers stop for sandhill cranes crossing the street,"- A 100-year-old Florida man is dead after the vehicle he was in crashed while sandhill cranes were crossing the road.

The Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) says that a Chrysler van was traveling westbound on Wickham Road, approaching two other vehicles who were stopped in the left lane for a family of sandhill cranes that were crossing the road.

The van is said to have swerved to the right to avoid the vehicles and then swerved back into the left lane when the driver noticed the sandhill cranes were in the road. The front of the van struck the rear of one vehicle, which was pushed into a third vehicle. The front of the van went on to also strike the front of the third vehicle.

A passenger in the van, a 100-year-old man, died at Holmes Regional hospital after this crash. We have not yet received his identity. Two others from the other two involved vehicles were injured as well. 63-year-old Brian Giantonio suffered serious injuries and 63-year-old Deliece White suffered minor injuries.

FHP is still investigating the crash.

353,Man o' war sightings reported on St. Johns County beaches,"0 Man o' war sightings reported on St. Johns County beaches

A trip to the beach on Mothers Day is a tradition for many families in Jacksonville.

Atlantic Beach mom Tracy Fout came out with her three children.

“They’re all little mermaids,” she said. “This is our go-to spot on Mothers Day.”

Some moms kept a close eye on their kids Sunday as more people reported seeing Man o’ war jellyfish in St. Johns County.

The blue creatures with long tentacles were reported from Vilano Beach down to Marineland.

“I’ve been stung by one before and it hurts pretty bad,” Jacksonville dad John Dinkins said. “It’s basically like you’re being electrocuted.”

No Man o' war sightings were reported in Duval, but families sent Action News Jax photos of another blue organism spotted at Jacksonville and Atlantic beaches.

I've spent my whole life on Florida's east coast but I've never seen these guys before. Can you name them? Families spotted them at Atlantic Beach and Jax Beach. @ActionNewsJax @WOKVNews pic.twitter.com/0641qq6tQq — Brittney Donovan (@brittneyANjax) May 12, 2019

We showed Max Ervanian with Jacksonville Beach Ocean Rescue. He said they appeared to be Porpita porpita. Known as “blue buttons,” they are small creatures similar to jellyfish.

He said Jax Beach hasn’t seen many jellyfish stings this week, and he doesn’t expect a spike in Man o' war sightings right now.

“The winds and the current are pushing the Man o’ war and the jellyfish away from the shore,” he said.

Ervanian says if you do see jellyfish, don’t touch them and see a lifeguard immediately if you're stung.

""It's just part of going to the beach, you know?"" Fout said. ""My kids know to avoid the jellyfish at all costs. ""If we see them in the water, we just don’t go in.""

355,AOC says she was ‘astonished' when man left sign outside her office in support of both her and Trump,"- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said a man left a sign outside her office on Friday that expressed support for both her and President Trump, a concept she said left her feeling “pretty astonished.”

The freshman lawmaker detailed the experience on Twitter, explaining that upon leaving work for the day, she discovered a man and a person she presumed to be his teenage son putting up a handmade sign outside her office.

It read: “Trump supporters for Ocasio-Cortez.”

About an hour ago, I was walking out of my office for the day.



There was a man what I believe was his teenage son hanging a small sign they made outside my office (we let people leave well wishes on our wall).



Astonishingly, his sign read: “Trump supporters for Ocasio-Cortez.” pic.twitter.com/IjVKbvetEI — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 10, 2019





The pair exchanged introductions and the man told her that “he wanted to show his support,” Ocasio-Cortez said. She was left struggling on how to ask him for an explanation, she said.

“I somehow got it out: ‘With all respect sir, how do you... manage to support both of us at the same time?’” Ocasio-Cortez said she asked. “This is what he said: ‘I’ve been saying for years that climate change is our most important crisis. You’re one of the only ones who‘s been willing to be decisive on it.’”

I was pretty astonished.



We shook hands, he introduced himself, and told me he wanted to show his support.



I could barely get my question out - I wanted to honor his positivity, yet respectfully find a way to ask, “How?” — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 10, 2019





“Then he said, ‘I like you. I can tell that you are genuine and fighting for us. You’re real and you get it.’ I thanked him and his family from the bottom of my heart,” she continued.

Since entering the political sphere, Ocasio-Cortez has been a champion for the Green New Deal, an economic stimulus concept designed to tackle income inequality and climate change.

Ocasio-Cortez chose to share her experience Friday as a means to spread a message of perseverance, she said, before accusing politicians and lobbyists of thwarting efforts to fix “our climate crisis.”

Then he said, “I like you. I can tell that you are genuine and fighting for us. You’re real and you get it.”



I thanked him and his family from the bottom of my heart. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 10, 2019





“All of this is to say don’t let any politician, no matter the party, lecture you about what is ‘possible’ or ‘electable,’” she tweeted. “Don’t ever let a politician imply that working people are ‘less-than’ or ‘uneducated’ - aka that they are the ones in the way of solving the climate crisis.”

The forces getting in the way of solving our climate crisis are politicians themselves + lobbyists. It is the willingness to bend to corporate power - the same ones that use coal miners’ plights for a tax break, yet refuse to pay for those same miners’ healthcare for black lung. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 10, 2019





She went on to encourage her followers to vote in line with their personal “values.”

“If you don’t understand this man’s sign - or don’t approach it with a desire to - then you do not understand this political moment,” she tweeted. “The same folks who said Trump was impossible in 2016 are the same ones lecturing on what’s ‘electable’ in 2020. Don’t buy it. Vote your values.”

Bill Gaston Sr., 71, of Marco Island, died Saturday when the airplane he was piloting crashed in East Naples. (Photo: Submitted)

Bill Gaston Sr., 71, died piloting a twin-engine plane from Key West. He was on his way to the Naples Airport. The scheduled hourlong flight ended just 5 miles from the airport, when the airplane crashed near a home in the 4900 block of Hawthorn Woods Way.

The plane was following the planned flight path until the final runway approach, according to flight-tracking website flightaware.com.

His son, Bill Gaston Jr., said his father had plenty of flight experience.

“He’s been a pilot since he was 16,” Gaston Jr. said. “He’s got plenty of flight hours.”

The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the crash investigation and had not released any information from it by mid-afternoon Sunday. However, Gaston Jr. said a medical crisis could have caused the crash.

“As another pilot, I would say it was health-related, based on how it crashed,” he said.

Gaston Jr. said his father was in good health and had regular checkups.

The plane, a 1964 Piper Twin Comanche, passed its yearly inspection, Gaston Jr. said.

Gaston Jr. said his father was in communication with air traffic controllers throughout the flight. No distress call was made, Gaston Jr. said. The airplane went down in a wooded area just east of Santa Barbara Boulevard and just south of Pine Ridge Road.

The plane was severely damaged in the crash, said Jamie Mosbach, a spokeswoman for the Collier County Sheriff’s Office.

No agency has stated whether another passenger was aboard, but Gaston Jr. does not think anyone else was on the flight.

His father regularly took friends and relatives on trips to Key West and the Bahamas.

After selling his business, Marco Island Cable, to Summit Broadband in 2013, Gaston Sr. spent much of his time boating and flying. He flew for 45 years.

“He was doing what he loved,” Gaston Jr. said.

Gaston Sr. had lived on Marco Island since 1984.

Guell, who was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and making false report of a crime in November 2018, had posted $21,000 bond and was released within a day of his arrest. Since then, prosecutors have dropped the local charges against Guell because he was indicted federally.

The 37-year-old Spring Hill man was picked up late last week and is being held by the United States Marshal at the Marion County Jail on a federal charge of possession of a firearm affecting commerce by a convicted felon.

In November, police officers went to Florida Hospital, now Adventheath Ocala, to investigate an incident involving a man at the facility with a gunshot wound. Guell had been shot in the stomach.

Guell told police he was in town for a job and was at an unknown hotel drinking when he decided to get pizza, according to an arrest report. He said he went out and while returning to the hotel, he stopped at a gas station and someone tried to rob him.

Guell said the robber fired two shots at him when he told the assailant he did not have anything. Guell said he called an Uber to take him to the hospital.

Police say Guell’s story changed significantly when they asked him more questions. According to the report, Guell eventually told officers he was drinking in his vehicle, pulled out a handgun, and accidentally fired two shots, one of which hit his stomach.

Guell gave several reasons for lying, one of them being that he is a convicted felon. He was later transferred to Ocala Regional Medical Center for further treatment and, upon his release, was arrested.

Federal officials in their charging document said Guell has five felony convictions, to include drugs, all from New Jersey.

A search warrant was served on the vehicle and law enforcement officials recovered 26 rounds of .40-caliber ammunition, seven .40-caliber casings, a black Ruger semi-automatic handgun, two bottles of Hoppes gun oil, a gun cleaning kit with brushes and a package of shooting targets. The gun, according to ATF Special Agent Dewane Krueger, was manufactured in Arizona and therefore crossed state lines prior to it being discovered in Florida.

366,Man who reported girl missing arrested in her disappearance,"HOUSTON - The man who reported a 4-year-old Texas girl had been abducted from him last weekend was arrested near Houston Saturday and police say they have found blood in his apartment linked to the girl.



Darion Vence was arrested without incident at his brother's home in Sugar Land, Texas, about 22 miles (35 kilometers) southwest of Houston, a statement from Houston police said. He was charged with tampering with evidence.



Vence told police last Saturday that men in a pickup truck abducted him, 4-year-old Maleah Davis and his 2-year-old son before freeing him and the boy. But Sugar Land police, who initially interviewed him, said his story kept changing and didn't add up.



Houston police said Saturday that some details of his story turned out to be false. Vence reported his silver Nissan Altima was taken in the abduction but surveillance video showed that vehicle was used to drop Vence off later at a hospital, where he reported the abduction, police said.



""Blood evidence obtained from Vence's apartment has been linked to Maleah,"" the Houston police statement said.



Vence also was observed carrying a full laundry basket from the apartment, police said. That basket was later found in the trunk of the Nissan along with a gas can.



Maleah's mother Brittany Bowens, said Vence is her former fiance. Bowens appeared outside her apartment Friday as Quanell X, a local civil rights activist, addressed reporters on her behalf.



Quanell X said that Vence had abused Maleah and that Bowens believes Vence harmed the girl.



Vence and Bowens were recently in a fight and she broke off their engagement, Quanell X said.



Child Protective Services removed Maleah and her brothers from the home Vence and Bowens shared in August after the girl suffered a head wound, but the children were returned in February, according to an agency spokeswoman.

393,Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission extends harvest prohibition in red tide areas; holds off on new trout regulations,"CLOSE Recreational anglers are about to receive reduced bag limits on trout, which they welcome, but commercial fishing data may indicate a larger problem. Ed Killer, ed.killer@tcpalm.com

The 7-member, governor-appointed Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission made two important decisions Wednesday morning during its regularly-scheduled meeting in Havana, near Tallahassee. Both will have future impacts on recreational fishing in Florida.

The commission approved an FWC staff recommendation to continue catch and release measures currently in place for red drum (redfish) and snook from the Pasco-Hernando county line through Gordon Pass in Collier County for one year. An executive order from August 2018 prohibited harvest of snook and redfish in red tide affected waters where massive fish kills took place last summer. In September, the order was extended to cover the waters of Tampa Bay north to Pasco County, and to be in place through May 10, 2019. In February 2019, additional catch and release measures were put in place to prohibit harvest of spotted seatrout larger than 20 inches.

Wednesday, the FWC voted to continue to keep snook and redfish catch and release only through next year, re-evaluating snook prior to the March 1, 2020 spring season opener for state waters of the Gulf of Mexico. It also voted to expand the prohibition on harvest of all sizes of seatrout for one year from Pasco-Hernando county line through Gordon Pass in Collier County. The measures will be in effect until May 31, 2020.

The FWC also decided to prohibit commercial harvest of spotted seatrout in this same area for the next year.

""We support FWC’s response to address red tide impacts on our iconic southwest Florida fisheries,"" said Kellie Ralston, Southeast Fisheries Policy Director for the American Sportfishing Association. ""Extending and expanding catch and release requirements for an additional year will allow redfish, snook and spotted seatrout stocks to recover from the devastating bloom last year. We look forward to revisiting the status of these stocks after they’ve had this important time to rebuild.""

This is the zone affected in 2018 by red tide fish kills and will now have a prohibition on recreational harvest of snook, redfish and trout until May 31, 2020. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED MAP BY FWC)

In another measure which addressed spotted seatrout stocks statewide, the FWC directed staff to further examine the economically important species and account for some of the issues brought up during the public comment period Wednesday. Staff had made recommendations to reduce recreational trout fishing bag limits in each of the four management zones in state waters, but will now delay that move until later in the year.

Grouper season open

May 1 is the opening of the recreational fishing season for grouper and hogfish in South Atlantic waters, including those off the coast of Florida.

The following species may now be harvested in state and federal waters: hogfish; gag grouper, black grouper, red grouper, yellowmouth grouper and yellowfin grouper; scamp; red hind; rock hind; coney; and graysby.

Hogfish will remain open through Oct. 31, 2019, on the east coast of Florida as well as south and east of Cape Sable on the Gulf coast. The other species will remain open through Dec. 31, 2019, on the east coast of Florida and all state waters off Monroe County.

Unfortunately, because of an early season tropical disturbance in the Atlantic Ocean just off the Florida coast, easterly winds and rough seas will likely prevent offshore anglers from being able to successfully target grouper until Friday or Saturday, at the earliest. Grouper are typically caught on deep reefs in 90-160 feet of water. Hogfish are most commonly caught by divers who are spearfishing. They rarely take a baited hook.

The Florida record hogfish, 19 pounds, 8 ounces, was landed in 1962 by Robert Batson off Daytona Beach. The state record gag grouper was 80 pounds, 6 ounces caught off Destin by Bill Smith in 1993. The state record black grouper weighed 113 pounds, 6 ounces and was caught off the Dry Tortugas in 1990 by Donald Bone.

For more information about hogfish and grouper bag and size limits, gear restrictions and fishing seasons, including a map of the Atlantic and Gulf grouper fishing boundaries, go to MyFWC.com/Marine and select “Recreational Regulations.”

FORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (WFLA) - A Florida man was arrested early Friday morning after deputies say he attacked a mattress because he thought there was a man hiding inside.

Okaloosa County deputies were called to a home in the Fort Walton Beach area just after 1 a.m. and arrested 37-year-old Felipe Oquendo. An arrest report says Oquendo admitted he had smoked methamphetamine earlier in the day.

According to deputies, Oquendo's girlfriend called for help when he started acting erratically. She told deputies Oquendo thought she was cheating on him with a man inside the mattress. Oquendo stabbed the mattress with a bedpost then ripped it apart with his bare hands, the arrest report says.

He is also accused of locking the bedroom door and not letting his girlfriend leave. While he was moving the mattress around, deputies say the girlfriend was able to unlock the door, escape and call for help.

When deputies got to the scene, Oquendo told them he was fighting the man in the mattress and holding him down but said the man slipped out and left.

401,"Despite rhetoric, guns won't be in many classrooms | Bill Cotterell","Now that Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed the new “guns in classrooms” legislation that state legislators so hotly debated this year, you know what’s going to change?

Not much.

There’s something about guns that triggers hyperbole on both sides. Judging from debate by opponents, and several social-media posts in the past week, you’d think Dirty Harry is going to be calling the roll in homeroom while Rambo patrols the playground of your local school.

Conservatives seem to think having more weaponry will make students safer, that the next evil, insane misfit with an AR-15 will be deterred by knowing the English Lit teacher just might have a pistol in her purse. Liberals, meanwhile, seem to believe counselling and mental health services can somehow paper over the damage inflicted by broken families and – well, by whatever else makes angry, armed lunatics behave like angry, armed lunatics.

Perhaps the hysteria is understandable, when guns are involved.

We saw it 30 years ago, when Florida passed its “concealed carry” legislation, allowing law-abiding citizens to get licenses and have guns holstered under a coat, or perhaps in a pocket. During prolonged, emotional debate in the House and Senate, opponents warned that Florida would turn into the wild west, with minor traffic accidents or barroom quarrels turning into street-corner shootouts.

The conservatives, who prevailed in that debate and most since then, contended that what matters is who carries a gun — not how they carry it. And pro-gun legislators also predicted we might all be a bit safer, if aggressors suspected that a potential victim might be armed.

Another reasonable explanation for the heated hyperbole is, this is Florida. Other states passed “concealed carry” laws and hardly anyone noticed. But, as our tourism slogan said at the time, “The rules are different here.” When Florida started issuing concealed weapon-permits, late-night comics did jokes about it. Sports Illustrated even headlined a cover story on the FSU-Miami football game, “Shootout in the Gunshine State.”

Well, that’s Florida for you — that’s why “Florida Man” is a whole separate category for quirky news stories.

In 2005, there were the same kind of disaster predictions and national news alarm when the Legislature enacted the “stand your ground” law. That’s the one saying you don’t have to seek safety or try to escape a dangerous confrontation, but can use force — up to and including lethal force – in self-defense.

The law has been abused. State attorneys have complained that shooters can get off with highly questionable claims of self-defense, maybe a mistaken perception of danger in a panicked instant. But repeated attempts at repealing “stand your ground” have gone nowhere in the Legislature.

The political results have borne out the pro-gun stance. Few, if any, legislators lose their seats in the House or Senate for aggressively proclaiming eternal fealty to the Second Amendment. Rather, accusing your opponent of being soft on gun control is a safe strategy in most districts.

But, really, have you changed your behavior because of any new firearms laws in Florida? Are you afraid to go out because your once tranquil neighborhood is turning into the O.K. Corral?

The legislation allowing some teachers to be armed was a shock to the senses. Nobody likes the idea. It is horribly sad to think that, on top of everything else we expect of them, some of your kid’s teachers might be asked to take on the truly awesome responsibility of a life-or-death decision in an emergency.

But they don’t have to. In fact, some who might be willing will be rejected from the “guardian” designation.

The authorization is voluntary. No teacher will be issued a gun and ordered to start taking marksmanship training.

Whole school districts can opt out, as some counties have already indicated they will do when the law takes effect Oct. 1. Teacher volunteers who are chosen for guardian status will be screened and required to take firearms-safety training.

Is that enough? No, of course not — certainly not when children are concerned. But neither is looking at only the mental-health side of the situation and hoping the unthinkable won’t happen.

Nobody will be celebrating guns in the classroom next fall. But, despite all the alarming arguments heard in the legislative session, and the week since it adjourned, the new law is not really going to change much.

HOUSTON (AP) — Houston police say they found “blood evidence” in the apartment of Darion Vence that matches that of the missing 4-year-old girl, Maleah Davis.

In a statement on the arrest of Vence, Houston police say that he has been charged with tampering with evidence.

They also say that Vence was observed carrying a full laundry basket from the apartment.

The laundry basket was found in the trunk of Vence’s silver Nisson Altima, which was recovered in Missouri City, Texas, Thursday.

Vence reported last Saturday that Maleah had been abducted from him.

417,Man o' Wars washing up on St. Augustine Beach,"ST. AUGUSTINE BEACH, Fla. - Some people heading to St. Augustine Beach have seen some Man o' Wars on the sand. Members of the St. Augustine Lifesaving Association said they have a couple Man o' Wars but nothing too much out of the ordinary.

They said they get pushed onto shore by winds and tides every so often.

The Portuguese man o' war is a predatory species. It uses its feeding tentacles to sting and paralyze small fishes, pelagic crustaceans, and other invertebrates. The feeding tentacles may be up to 160 feet long in some individuals! These tentacles deliver a powerful sting and are also used for defense against predation.

Each individual Portuguese man o' war is either a male or a female, and they reproduce sexually via a method known as broadcast spawning. Large groups of individuals come together, where females release their eggs and males release their sperm into the water column, all at the same time. This method increases the likelihood that eggs will be fertilized.

The Portuguese man o' war is not valuable, commercially, and is common throughout the tropics. In some places, it is increasing in numbers, likely a result of changing open ocean food webs. This species’ sting can be very painful if encountered by people. When there are large numbers of individuals in an area, it is best to avoid swimming.

They are covered in venom-filled nematocysts used to paralyze and kill fish and other small creatures. For humans, a man-of-war sting is excruciatingly painful but rarely deadly.

On Wednesday, a girl said she was walking to Blankner School around 9:15 a.m. when she was approached by a man on a dark colored BMX-style bicycle who touched her inappropriately, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

Orlando police officers said a girl walking to Boone High School around 6:45 a.m. Tuesday reported a similar incident.

Officials with Orange County Public Schools sent alerts to parents on Thursday, reminding them to warn their children to stay safe.

""Parents, please take this time to talk with your student about stranger danger. Remind them to always be aware of their surroundings and encourage your student to walk in pairs or in groups,"" said Dr. Junella Kreil, Blankner School principal.

419,Man arrested in connection with attempted kidnapping of 12-year-old girl in Miami,"Terry Rivers, 50, of Miami, is accused of groping and trying to kidnap a 12-year-old girl in Miami.

MIAMI - A 50-year-old man was arrested Thursday in connection with the attempted kidnapping of a 12-year-old girl in Miami, authorities said.

Terry Rivers, of Miami, faces charges of kidnapping and lewd and lascivious molestation of a child.

According to an arrest report, the victim was walking to her bus stop the morning of April 12 in the area of Northwest First Avenue and 57th Street when she was approached by Rivers.

""Hey. Where are you going?"" Rivers asked her, according to the report.

""I'm going over there,"" the girl responded.

""But where are you going?"" Rivers asked again, according to the report.

Police said the girl ignored Rivers' question and continued walking east.

She told police she turned around a short time later to find Rivers running toward her.

Police said Rivers grabbed the victim by the hair and waist, pulled her toward him and began to grope her breast.

Authorities said the victim pushed Rivers away and ran back toward her house.

Police said Rivers ran away in an unknown direction.

Authorities later released a sketch of the suspect, which led to police receiving an anonymous tip identifying Rivers as the victim's attacker.

According to the arrest report, the victim then identified Rivers in a six-person photo lineup.

Police said Rivers denied having any involvement in the incident and claimed he has never been in the area where the incident occurred or came into contact with any children.

Police say 21-year-old Jeffery Morrow Jr. and a friend had agreed to meet Manns in a Lakeland parking lot in September 2016. They had met through the online marketplace Letgo.

The friend showed Manns the iPhone, and Manns snatched it and ran away. Morrow grabbed a shotgun from his truck and he and the friend then chased Manns. Investigators say Manns was also armed and fatally shot Morrow.

A defense lawyer argued that Manns had given a false confession to deputies shortly after his arrest.

427,"Century after historic transatlantic flight, NC-4 still captures spirit of exploration","CLOSE The National Naval Aviation Museum’s latest exhibit allows guests to experience the Apollo 11 moon landing in VR. Melissa Nelson Gabriel, mnelsongab@pnj.com

A century after the landmark days in May 1919 when it captured headlines as the first aircraft to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, the NC-4 (NC stands for Navy-Curtiss, the latter the primary manufacturer) flying boat immediately attracted the attention of visitors to the National Naval Aviation Museum.

Early photographs of the airplane being assembled in 1974 after arrival on loan from the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., show finishing work being performed on the interior of the building in which it has been housed for nearly 50 years. Once the sole structure on the museum’s current campus, it is now the south wing. The museum has literally grown up around the NC-4.

Aviation is a fast-paced technological field and the history of the NC-4 reflects that. Consider that the airplane had a top speed of 85 mph and just 50 years after its flight across the Atlantic, man ventured to the moon. In the arena of transatlantic flight, it took just days after the NC-4’s crossing for a British airplane to fly non-stop from Newfoundland to Ireland. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh accomplished the feat alone and he has been synonymous with transatlantic flight ever since.

Following his flight, Lindbergh crossed the country and visited Latin America in his airplane The Spirit of St. Louis. The NC-4 made a similar splash when it returned to the United States, where it was displayed in Central Park and seen by nearly one million people in just two weeks. One reporter wrote at the time that the airplane ""has not been repainted or decorated since her record-making trip, but presents practically the same appearance she did at the end of her flight. ... All this is just as it should be and the crowds who saw the ship yesterday appeared to be especially pleased.""

That did not last long. The Navy repaired the airplane so that it could fly on a 44-stop recruiting tour down the eastern seaboard, around the tip of Florida (it stopped at NAS Pensacola twice), and into the Midwest that covered 6,690 miles. One can only imagine what it was like for everyday Americans, most of whom had never seen an airplane fly, behold the NC-4 with its 126-foot wingspan descending to a water landing near their town.

However, as years passed, the NC-4 was largely forgotten. For a time, the Smithsonian owned the hull and the Navy retained the other components. Not until 1961 did the former acquire all of the aircraft and it was just in time to start a multi-year restoration process resulting the airplane being displayed on the National Mall in the nation’s capital in 1969 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its transatlantic flight.

At the time, the Smithsonian was planning a new building that would open in July 1976. Budgetary restrictions resulted in a smaller structure than originally planned and there was no room for the NC-4. Fortuitously, what was then called the Naval Aviation Museum was in the midst of its own expansion and the rest is history. The museum is fortunate to have the airplane on display on this, the 100th anniversary of its historic feat, which captured the spirit of exploration as did those who participate in another historic event we commemorate this year, the Apollo 11 moon landing. Believe it or not there is a personal link between the two events. The signature approving the loan of the NC-4 was that of Michael Collins, the Command Module pilot of Apollo 11 who after retiring from NASA became the director of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

428,Blocked sidewalks irk former Shalimar mayor,"SHALIMAR — Longtime former Mayor Gary Combs has been on a self-described “crusade.”

He served as the town’s mayor for 20 years before passing the gavel to Mark Franks last month.

But judging by recent emails he’s sent to Franks and other Shalimar officials, Combs hasn’t lost any of his activist spirit for the town, which covers about a quarter square mile and has a little more than 800 residents.

An email Combs sent to officials on Wednesday contained photos of two vehicles blocking driveway sidewalks and of an apparently illegally-parked boat on a trailer.

“Today, at least three times, I witnessed a SPD (Shalimar Police Department) cruiser pass by my house -- so much for enforcement of ROW parking as this boat on a trailer and extra trailer have been parked on Town ROW for the past two days – (it) is still there now and it’s definitely not behind the signs which say no parking beyond this point,” wrote Combs, who owns five rental properties in Shalimar.

That email also contained his concern about the sidewalk-blocking autos.

“Even with only one vehicle in the drive (been this way all day), the resident still chooses to block the sidewalk,” Combs said about one of the vehicles.

He followed up that email with another one to town officials on Thursday.

“I understand from emails and meeting minutes, the Town of Shalimar attorney has told the Town Commission and Shalimar Police Department that they do not need to enforce the Florida Statues on blocking sidewalks in driveways,” Combs wrote.

According to statute 316.1945: Except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic, or in compliance with law or the directions of a police officer or official traffic control device, no person shall stop, stand, or park a vehicle on a sidewalk.

Combs said pedestrians can legally walk down the town’s streets when residents block the sidewalk.

“So, if the Town of Shalimar wants to legally allow pedestrians to walk in the streets, then the Town needs to remove all existing sidewalks!” he said in his email. “Why is it that only a few have to ruin it for the many? The answer is politicians allow it!”

Combs also said that when he moved to Shalimar more than two decades ago, town police “never allowed a resident to block the sidewalk with a permanently parked vehicle.

“As you can tell I am on a crusade! Just for the record, I am not in favor of removing sidewalks. I just want them to be available for safe pedestrian traffic where they exist!”

On Friday, Franks said the Town Commission conducted a workshop on parking issues on April 23. It took place two weeks after Combs passed the gavel to Franks.

“I was hoping he would have showed up but he didn’t,” Franks said of the former mayor.

According to the workshop minutes, town Police Chief John Cash said enforcing the rule against parking on driveway sidewalks would take quite a bit of time and would take away from other police duties.

The police department consists of Cash, a captain and two officers.

At the workshop, Franks asked if any residents wanted to speak on the issue of parking on sidewalks.

According to the meeting minutes, “Resident Frank Kane said that they have lived in the Town of Shalimar for many years and never have seen where a vehicle blocking the sidewalk was a safety issue.”

Kane is the man who Combs singled out in his email on Wednesday for two incidents of a vehicle blocking a driveway sidewalk. One photo showed the driveway at Kane's house and the other showed the driveway at Kane’s rental unit, according to Combs.

At the workshop, the commission agreed to leave it up to the police department to enforce any specific safety issue on a case-by-case basis.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190512/blocked-sidewalks-irk-former-shalimar-mayor?rssfeed=true,2019-05-12T07:59:03Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Florida Man,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

GENEVA (AP) — Almost every country in the world has agreed on a legally binding framework for reducing polluting plastic waste, with the United States a notable exception, United Nations environmental officials said Friday.

An agreement on tracking thousands of types of plastic waste emerged at the end of a two-week meeting of U.N.-backed conventions on plastic waste and toxic, hazardous chemicals. Discarded plastic clutters pristine land, floats in huge masses in oceans and entangles wildlife, sometimes with deadly results.

Rolph Payet of the United Nations Environment Program said the “historic” agreement linked to the 186-country, U.N.-supported Basel Convention means countries will have to monitor and track movements of plastic waste outside their borders.

“It’s sending a very strong political signal to the rest of the world — to the private sector, to the consumer market — that we need to do something,” Payet said. “Countries have decided to do something which will translate into real action on the ground.”

The deal affects products used in a broad array of industries, such as health care, technology, aerospace, fashion, and food and beverages.

Countries will have to figure out their own ways of adhering to the accord, Payet said. Even the few non-signatory countries, like the United States, could be impacted when they ship plastic waste to countries that are on board.

Payet credited Norway for leading the initiative, which first was presented in September. The time from then to approval was a blistering pace of change by traditional U.N. standards.

The framework “is historic in the sense that it is legally binding,” Payet said. “They (the countries) have managed to use an existing international instrument to put in place those measures.”

The agreement is likely to lead to customs agents being on the lookout for electronic or other types of potentially hazardous waste more than before.

“There is going to be a transparent and traceable system for export and import of plastic waste,” Payet said.",https://www.wfla.com/national/almost-every-country-in-the-world-signs-plastic-waste-agreement-except-us/1996720142,2019-05-11T21:54:13Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

WALTON COUNTY, Fla.- A Panama City man is arrested in Walton County after soliciting who he thought was a 14-year-old girl, for sex.

26 year-old Christopher Jackson Jr. engaged with an undercover officer through a social media account depicting a 14-year-old female.

Reports said during the exchange, Jackson got increasingly sexual in nature and asked for nude pictures.

He also indicated through his chats that he wanted to have sex with the juvenile. Jackson is charged with two counts of using a computer to solicit a child for sex and traveling to meet a minor for sex, both felonies in the state of Florida.

He's been booked into the Walton County jail.

433,Man extricated from pickup that overturned Saturday on I-75,"Marion County Fire Rescue officials extricated a Titusville man from a pickup that slammed into an Interstate 75 guardrail and then entered a highway where it overturned onto its roof early Saturday morning.

Brandon Ceon, the 33-year-old driver and sole occupant in an older model Chevy Silverado, was transported to Ocala Regional Medical Center where he’s expected to recover from his injuries, according to a Florida Highway Patrol trooper on scene. Ceon was wearing a seat belt, according to the trooper.

FHP officials were notified about the single-vehicle wreck shortly after 12:30 a.m.

The crash, located less than five miles from the County Road 484 exit, blocked the middle and left lanes on I-75 southbound for several hours.

It was the second single vehicle crash that shut down two lanes of I-75 within the last several days. On Monday night, the driver of a semi-truck hauling 41,000 pounds of bananas crashed into the guardrail and overturned onto its side roughly eight miles south of the County Road 318 interchange. The driver was not seriously injured, troopers said.

Officials said the Chevy was traveling southbound in the outside lane. A female witness told authorities she was in the center lane and the pickup drove by her. The woman said that while was passing her, the driver veered for an unknown reason oto the west grassy shoulder. He tried to return to the roadway and in doing so over-corrected, which caused the vehicle to cross all three lanes. The vehicle drove onto the shoulder where the passenger side struck the guardrail.

The vehicle then made its way back onto I-75 and flipped on its roof, pinning the driver inside. Rescue officials arrived and removed the man from the vehicle.

Two South Carolina inmates are charged in a sextortion blackmail scheme that led to the death of a 24-year-old Army veteran, authorities announced Friday.Greenville Police Chief Ken Miller said a months-long investigation led to blackmail charges against Lee Correctional inmates John William Dobbins Jr., 59, of North Charleston, and Carl Richard Smith Jr., 43, of Simpsonville.Miller said Dobbins and Smith used a contraband cellphone to operate a dating app scam in which they pretended to be a young woman and eventually exchanged nude pictures. They then pretended to be the parents of the young woman, who they claimed was underage, and threatened criminal charges and demanded money, Miller said. The victims, even innocent, would often pay, the chief said.An investigation called Operation Surprise Party uncovered a sextortion ring in the Carolinas in which inmates used contraband cellphones to target 442 service members from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. Authorities said the schemes cost service members more than $560,000.One victim of the scam was Jared Johns, Miller said. He served in the Army and was injured in Afghanistan. The father of two came home to battle post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.The scammers demanded nearly $1,200 from Johns. On Sept. 11, 2018, less than 24 hours after receiving the texts, Johns committed suicide. His twin brother found him.Johns left messages behind, including one on a dry erase board that said: “I’m sorry I’ve messed up. I love you all. This is not what I wanted. Tell my sons I was a good man.”“It was the thought of being arrested,” Johns’ mother, Kathy Bowling. said. “They convinced him he did something wrong.”After some investigating and law enforcement confirmation, Johns' parents later learned at least one inmate from Lee Correctional Facility scammed their son, sending texts from prison.“They never should have been able to reach him,” Bowling said. “I’m angry and you can’t put into words how you feel as a parent.”Johns' father said he wanted people to know his son was a great man, soldier and father.“These prisoners were put in there to protect us from them doing any more crime,” Kevin Johns said. “They are in there still doing crimes and people are still getting hurt.”The Johns pushed for legislation that would encourage state prisons to jam cellphone service.“These jammers are needed now more than ever, because I don’t want another family to have to go through what we went through,” Bowling said.Brian Sterling, with the South Carolina Department of Corrections, was at Friday’s news conference with Miller. He said he wants to see inmates cellphone signals banned. He said the solution is simple: jam signals and use geo-fencing.He said without taking those actions, prisons are “virtually out here, among us.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/tell-my-sons-i-was-a-good-man-sextortion-scam-led-to-young-army-vets-death-police-say/27440777,2019-05-11T09:34:00Z,WPBF-TV,Florida Man,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

438,Plantation man tells police he shot 'disrespectful' wife in face,"Fernando De Baere, 73, is accused of shooting his wife in the face at their Plantation home.

PLANTATION, Fla. - A 73-year-old man shot his wife in the face this week inside their Plantation home, then walked to a neighbor's house and confessed that he'd killed her, authorities said.

Plantation police investigators said Fernando De Baere told them he shot Marisa Sherman, 47, because she wouldn't stop speaking disrespectfully.

According to an arrest report, De Baere went to a neighbor's home Tuesday night and told them he had just killed his wife.

The neighbor called 911 and a responding officer found De Baere's wife sitting upright on the living room couch with an apparent gunshot wound to the face, the report stated.

The officer pronounced Sherman dead at 10:36 p.m.

No one else was inside the home, authorities said.

Police said De Baere had blood splatters on his legs and boxer shorts. He told police he and his wife were arguing over her interactions with a former co-worker.

According to the police report, De Baere said he took issue with ""the way that she was talking to him."" When she wouldn't stop talking, he got his .38-caliber handgun and shot her, authorities said.

Police said De Baere admitted to shooting his wife ""one or two times"" in the face while standing about 3 feet away from her.

Authorities said De Baere put his gun back in his closet after the shooting before going to his neighbor's home.

De Baere told police his home is equipped with surveillance cameras inside and outside the home, the report stated.

De Baere was arrested on a premeditated murder charge. A lawyer for him isn't listed on jail records.

There's no question Michael Jackson was the king of pop in the 1980s, and Madonna wasn't far behind. But if there's a Mount Rushmore of rockers from that era, Bryan Adams certainly deserves consideration.

The Canadian songwriter and musician — with his first major hit ""Cuts Like A Knife"" — performs May 6 in Jacksonville, May 7 in St. Petersburg and May 10 at the Wharf Amphitheater in Orange Beach, Alabama, near Pensacola with tickets for as little as about $20.

Adams charted other mega-hits, including ""Summer of '69,"" ""This Time"" from his debut 1983 album, ""Cuts Like A Knife"" and ""Run To You"" from the 1984 album ""Reckless.""

Plan ahead

Rob Thomas

Rob Thomas is known as the front-man for Matchbox 20, but perhaps his greatest claim to fame was singing on Santana's wildly successful song ""Smooth"" that he co-wrote.

It won three Grammys in 2000, including Song of the Year and as last year Billboard considered the second most successful song of all time after Chubby Checker's 1960 hit ""The Twist.""

Thomas and his ""Chip Tooth Tour"" into the Sunshine State this summer, with concerts set for July 2 at Mizner Park in Boca Raton; July 3 at Hard Rock Live Orlando; July 5 at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg; and July 6 at Daily's Place in Jacksonville.

His Matchbox 20 hits have remained pop music staples in recent years, including ""Real World,""""3AM"" and ""Push.""

Brian Regan (Photo: Brian Friedman)

Brian Regan

Jerry Seinfeld has called him one of his favorite comedians, and Brian Regan has earned his stature among standup legends.

The South Florida native tours it seems constantly, and returns to Florida with shows July 26 at Barbara B. Mann Hall in Fort Myers with tickets around $50 each.

The next night, Regan is at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg and tickets start around $40.

Regan is known for his clean comedy, with popular skits including ""Say Eight"" and ""Doughnut Lady.""

He still prides himself on being able to walk in public pretty much anonymously; a few years ago in an interview with the Naples Daily News, Regan discussed how he and his children had just spent a day at Disney World in Orlando and he went unrecognized.

Felipe Oquendo, 37, is charged with false imprisonment and possession of drug

paraphernalia in connection with an incident early Friday morning.

Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office deputies were called to the home on Willow Bend

Boulevard around 1:10 a.m. Friday. The caller said Oquendo had started acting erratically and accused her of cheating on him with a man in the mattress.

She claimed Oquendo had stabbed the mattress with a bedpost, then ripped it apart

with his hands. He then locked the bedroom door and refused to let the woman leave, but she was able to escape while he was preoccupied with the mattress, according to an arrest report.

When deputies arrived, Oquendo reportedly told them he had felt the mattress moving. He said had asked his girlfriend to help him figure out what was happening, but had not prevented her from leaving, according to the report.

Oquendo told OCSO deputies he was fighting the man in the mattress, holding him

down when they arrived, but the man then slipped out and left.

He admitted to smoking methamphetamine earlier in the day, and deputies found a glass pipe in his possession they believed was used for narcotics.

Oquendo was taken into custody and booked into Okaloosa County Jail.

452,Does cancer lobby want to cure cancer to make money?: your say,"0512 CARTOON (Photo: Rick McKee, The Augusta Chronicle, GA)

Tough question

A few years ago, we launched a recording object into space and hit a comet traveling about 35,000 miles per hour.

Our scientists knew the time of impact, the direction, its depth in space, and all surrounding bodies that might have an effect on the trajectory of this historic event. The science, mathematics, and knowledge going into this project was perfect and enormously effective.

A radio engineer, John Kanzius with a limited scientific education by that standard, invented a radio wave treatment heating nano-particles to kill cancerous tumors without damaging surrounding tissue. Thrust onto the scene, it got funding. Now its in needless litigation about money, who gets to spend it, and who gets paid the most if it succeeds.

Does the cancer research lobby care about curing cancer or living off its continuance? Tough question?

What do you think?

Target polluters

We keep hearing we need to get rid of plastic bags, straws and cups because of plastic ocean pollution, but the U.S. is very low at number 20 of nations that plastic pollute, with 0.9 percent of mismanaged plastic waste compared with China’s 27.7 percent (USA TODAY).

The U.S.’s excellent record is due to our garbage collection and recycling programs. Here in Fort Myers, most ocean plastic pollution is caused by boaters, fishermen and beachgoers. Land-based folks who dispose of garbage and plastic in suitable containers contribute a minuscule amount of plastic to our waterways.

Warm person

I met Joe Biden, in his home, when I interviewed him as a senator. I met Donald Trump, when I interviewed him at his office in Trump Tower, at one of his failed casinos in Atlantic City, and aboard his ship-yacht, The Princess, before he lost that to creditors. I’d take Joe Biden over the crooked Trump, any day. Biden is a very warm and caring person. Trump is a cold and self-serving.



It’s a shame that partisans call Biden creepy. He’s a genuinely, warm person. The day I interviewed him, he put his hand on my shoulder (gasp), looked me straight in the eye, and thanked me for my work. Trump just talked about himself. But I won’t vote for either man. Trump lacks integrity, values and never accepts personal responsibility. Biden represents the establishment. And like Republicans, Biden sees no problem with the money in our politics today.



I’d rather see a much younger person, who is interested in all people, rather than in corporations, the wealthy, and dark money. Corporations aren’t even mentioned in our Constitution, but people are. And, corporations are not people, they’re fictitious entities.

Doing job

As in Newton's Law of Motion, so it is in the Mailbag: to every action (idea) there is always an equal and opposite reaction, so it seems. Here is my reaction to the writer who called President Trump ""an incompetent, destructive fool with a mental problem.""

In two years, this ""fool"" has produced an economy that has translated into real jobs and real income.

The unemployment rate is 3.6% and wages for low income workers are rising at nearly twice that of higher-paid workers, all reported by Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council. Trump has done this by being more aggressive and pro-growth than past administrations and by cutting red tape, deregulating, selling our products overseas, being tougher on trade regulations and by cutting taxes. He could also stop the border invasion if the House Democrats would help.

One may not like this or that about Trump but an incompetent fool he is not. He has succeeded – and done so despite a hostile media, fake news and a dishonest investigation intended to take him down. He is doing the job.

And it is said our economy is the envy of the world.

453,Man who stood through sunroof on I-4 faces domestic violence charges,"- A man who was the subject of a bizarre and dangerous video depicting him standing through his sunroof driving down I-4 is now facing multiple charges stemming from domestic violence incidents involving his wife.

Leonard Olsen, 70, has been behind bars since the release of a video recorded by an off-duty Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputy. It showed Olsen with his arms spread wide driving down I-4 Tuesday using cruise control and reaching speeds of up to 100 miles per hour.

The Florida Highway Patrol later pulled him over and arrested him for reckless driving.

A short time later, The Polk County Sheriff's Office tacked on additional charges of false imprisonment, violent battery by strangulation and two counts of violent aggravated battery on a person older than 65. The sheriff's office said all the charges stem from incidents involving his wife.

The probable cause statement lists two incidents over the course of about a week.

Continue reading below

On April 30, Olsen was upset with his wife for taking too long to come to bed. Once she did, the statement said he ""reached over and began choking the victim.""

Days later on May 5, after the victim came home from dinner, Olsen ""began calling the victim vulgar names and accusing her of having an affair,"" according to the sheriff's office. That same day, the statement says he destroyed her clothes and forced her to remove her underwear.

His wife called authorities the next morning after Olsen left the home.

FOX 13 News knocked on Olsen's door Saturday, but no one answered.

Neighbors didn't want to go on camera, but said they've had multiple issues with Olsen, including one back in 2017, when they said Olsen fired off his gun multiple times in his backyard. SWAT responded to the incident.

He was later charged with discharging a firearm in public.

“We aren’t sure what was going on with Olsen the last few days but it’s never OK to put your hands on someone else, or endanger others while driving,"" Sheriff Grady Judd said in a statement released Saturday. ""We hope he’s learned a few lessons and gets the help he needs to avoid future jail time.”

On Friday, the Rays announced that catcher, Mike Zunino, was been placed on the 10 day injured list. As a result, a major trade happened during the game against the New York Yankees on Friday night.

Catcher Travis d'Arnaud is headed to Tampa from the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for cash. This comes less than a week after he signed with Dodgers following his release from the New York Mets.

Matt Duffy has been moved to the 60-day injured list to make room on 40-man roster.

HUDSON, Fla(WFLA) -

Robert Rodriguez says he feels pretty good for his age. At 88-years old, he's still mobile and driving and active. On Thursday, he was making a trip to the Beall's store on U.S. 19 in Hudson, just north of State Road 52, when a man approached his car in the parking lot.

It was 3:19 p.m. on Thursday, in broad daylight.

""Open the door, he pulled the door,"" said Rodriguez, who had no idea he was about to become the victim of a crime. ""And put the gun down here.""

The gunman pointed the gun at Rodriguez and began to bark out orders.

""He said, get out of the car. I got out of the car. And then, give me the keys. I gave him the keys,"" said Rodriguez. ""He pushed me and that's when I fall down to the floor and got this here (points at bruise) and this down here and he just drove away.""

Pasco Deputies rushed to the scene and located Rodriguez's car less than a mile away. But there was no sign of the carjacker.

The suspect is described as either a light skinned Black male or possibly a Hispanic male, approximately 40-50 years old, around 5'6"" - 5'7"" and 160 pounds. He is clean shaven with black hair. He may possibly be known as ""Allen"" (unknown spelling).

Rodriguez is pleased he wasn't hurt worse. He still has no idea why the man picked him.

"" Why this guy picked me out, you know, I don't know. It's probably because of where I was parked,"" Rodriguez said. ""Or probably, he said this is easy prey. He's an old man. Easy prey. ""

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed a bill that would have prevented Florida’s local governments from banning plastic straws.

DeSantis rejected the environmental regulation bill Friday, his first veto since taking office earlier this year.

The legislation originally addressed issues with contaminated recyclable materials but was amended to include a moratorium on local regulations of single-use plastic straws until 2024. A legislative analysis of the bill lists 10 Florida cities with straw bans, including Miami Beach, St. Petersburg and Fort Lauderdale.

DeSantis wrote in the veto that the bans hadn’t frustrated any state policy or harmed state interests. He says the Florida Department of Environmental Protection is encouraging residents to reduce plastic straw use. He added that residents who oppose the local bans should elect new city commissioners.

460,Deputies: 2 in custody after pursuit of stolen car,"Photo of car provided by Baker County Sheriff's Office on aerial from Sky 4

BALDWIN, Fla. - Two people were taken into custody Friday afternoon after a pursuit of stolen car in Northeast Florida, authorities said.

It started about 1:30 p.m. in Baker County and ended in Baldwin.

According to the Baker County Sheriff's Office, deputies were alerted to a vehicle in which the man driving assaulted a woman who was a passenger. Deputies said a witness reported the tag number of the vehicle and they learned the vehicle had been stolen from Jacksonville.

Deputies said they tried to stop the stolen vehicle, but it took off east on Interstate 10 toward Jacksonville.

During the pursuit, according to deputies, the vehicle, which appears to be a Mercedes, crashed in Baldwin and one person was taken into custody while another ran off.

The other person was eventually taken into custody with the help of a Jacksonville Sheriff's Office K-9 unit, deputies said.

The Florida Highway Patrol and CSX police were also involved in the pursuit of that person.

461,Romance playbook reveals social media pickup lines used in schemes are scripted,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Pages of pickup lines from what is purported to be a Nigerian “romance playbook” offers insight into

the scripted conversation young Nigerian men use to fool unsuspecting women on social media dating sites.

Diane Standish, a Central Florida widow, lost $270,000 to a man who used the photo of a foreign ambassador in a lie of love crafted with many of the same lines found in the playbook.

Standish, who filed for bankruptcy a few months ago, gave her alleged love interest her life savings. Today, she rents a room from a relative in Orlando.

The man, who claimed to be a contractor, asked her for various amounts of cash to help pay for a bogus construction project.

“Four months into it and he asked me to marry him,” she said. “ It makes me sick to my stomach.”

News 6 showed her the playbook that includes lines ranging from “Hi how was your weekend,"" to “Do you like to re-marry again?""

“I think every woman should see this, I would highly recommend it,” Standish said.

News 6 obtained the playbook from California-based Social Catfish, a high-energy group of cyberdetectives who track down the true identities of women and men claiming to want relationships on the online dating circuit.

Social Catfish CEO David McClellan said a 62-year-old woman’s poor health inspired an alleged Nigerian Romeo who goes by the name of Luke, to send the playbook to them via text.

“They’re screwing with your head,"" McClellan said. “They're pushing you to whatever it takes to give them money.”

In a Facetime interview with Social Catfish, Luke explained how he throws out a net in hopes of getting responses.

“We just send 1,000 messages, you get 100 replies,” he said.

In an email to News 6, Luke, who said his real name is Ogbama Godfrey, said he wanted to help expose the scammers but was afraid he would face arrest by U.S. authorities.

Godfrey wrote in part: “Know I’m going to be arrested after the interview, I might be used as bait for many successful scammers, it’s indeed a nice thing to see how much you want to investigate and know more about romance scam.”

According to the Federal Trade Commission, romance scams “rank number one” on total reported losses with a staggering $143 million last year.

The FTC reports the average loss per victim is about $2,600.

The catfish-style impostors use photographs lifted from legitimate social media sites such as Facebook.

Godfrey has used about a dozen different photos and admits stealing thousands of dollars from unsuspecting women.

The 22-year-old said the women are actually considered “clients” with a typical profile of: widow, divorced or depressed.

462,"Woman says boyfriend choked and punched her, so she stabbed him, according to ECSO","A Pensacola man was arrested after his girlfriend told investigators that he abused her throughout the day until she ultimately stabbed him in self-defense.

Calvin Williams, 50, was arrested Monday while he was still a patient at Baptist Hospital, where he was receiving treatment for a puncture wound.

He was charged with two counts of battery, false imprisonment and violation of a domestic violence injunction. His bond was set at $45,000.

According to an arrest report, the woman told deputies that Williams, her boyfriend of eight years, had physically abused her May 5. She said that despite an active domestic violence injunction stipulating that Williams have no contact with her, she allowed him to live with her to help pay rent.

The woman told deputies that around 8 p.m., she was sitting in the driver’s seat of Williams' car while he sat in the backseat directly behind her and Williams reached for her neck from behind and began choking her, the report stated.

The woman told deputies she could not talk nor breath because of his grasp, the report stated. Before he let go, Williams also punched her multiple times in the face, the woman told authorities.

Later in the evening at around 10 p.m., the woman told investigators Williams again starting punching her face while they were at home, the report stated.

The woman told deputies that she retreated to the kitchen, picked up a knife and told her boyfriend to let her leave. She said Williams blocked a doorway and her exit out of the home and refused to move.

In fear for her life, the woman said she stepped toward Williams, asked him to allow her to leave one more time and, when he refused, she stabbed the knife into his chest, according to the report.

The woman told investigators that before Williams drove away from the home, he said to her, ""B----, I can’t believe you stabbed me,"" according to the report.

Williams drove himself to West Florida Hospital’s Perdido Emergency Room on U.S. 98 before medical personnel later transported him to Baptist Hospital’s trauma unit.

Investigators observed “excessive” redness and swelling around the woman's left eye socket, bruises on her legs, a bruise on her chin and three large purplish bruises on her arm, the report stated.

476,Prosecutor: Dogs detected decomposition in Houston missing girl case,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Photos: Houston Police)

HOUSTON (AP) — Trained dogs detected the scent of human decomposition in the vehicle of a man arrested in connection with the disappearance of a 4-year-old Texas girl, according to a prosecutor.

Derion Vence, 26, remained jailed Sunday on a $1 million bond after being arrested a day earlier on a charge of tampering evidence, specifically a human corpse. His next court appearance is set for Monday.

Houston police said investigators have not found Maleah Davis and the investigation is continuing. Authorities have declined to say whether they believe Vence killed Maleah. But prosecutors said in court documents filed Saturday that Vence could face additional charges, including murder.

The investigation began after Vence told police that men in a truck on May 4 had abducted him, Maleah and his 2-year-old son a day earlier, but had freed him and the boy. Vence told investigators he was left in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land and walked to a hospital, where he reported the girl's abduction.

Sugar Land police, who initially interviewed him, said his story kept changing and didn't add up.

Vence, who had lived with Maleah and her mother, reported that his silver Nissan Altima was taken in the abduction, but surveillance video showed that vehicle was used to drop Vence off at the hospital. Police found the car Thursday.

Dogs trained to find cadavers reacted to the trunk of the car, Pat Stayton, a prosecutor with the Harris County District Attorney's Office, said at Vence's probable cause court hearing Saturday night.

Surveillance video from a neighbor showed Vence carrying a large, blue laundry basket with a large trash bag from his apartment on May 3, Stayton said. Vence returned three minutes later without the basket and later he was seen leaving the apartment with cleaning supplies, including bleach.

In the silver Nissan, police found a laundry basket that looked like the one Vence took out of his apartment, Stayton said.

""Both of the dogs reacted to the trunk of the silver Nissan that the defendant had driven and that the blue laundry basket was recovered from, indicating that the dogs were responding to the scent of human decomposition in the vehicle,"" Stayton said.

Investigators also found blood at the apartment, both in the hallway leading to the bathroom and on surfaces inside the bathroom, Stayton said.

At Saturday night's hearing, Vence said he planned to hire a defense attorney.

Rodney Brown, an attorney appointed to represent Vence only for Saturday's hearing, had asked a magistrate judge to set bond at $5,000, saying Vence was a low flight risk and had lived in Houston most of his life.

Stayton argued that Vence was a flight risk and there was ""evidence of deception on the part of the defendant with regard to information he gave to police.""

Police have described Vence as Maleah's stepfather, but Maleah's mother, Brittany Bowens, said through a spokesman that Vence is her former fiance. Quanell X, a local civil rights activist who spoke to reporters on Bowens' behalf on Friday, also said that Vence had abused Maleah.

Child Protective Services removed Maleah and her brothers from the home Vence and Bowens shared in August after the girl suffered a head wound, but the children were returned in February, according to an agency spokeswoman.",https://www.wfla.com/national/prosecutor-dogs-detected-decomposition-in-houston-missing-girl-case/1997828304,2019-05-12T18:21:16Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

KANSAS CITY, Kan. – Alva native Ross Chastain raced to his first NASCAR Trucks victory Friday night after leader Stewart Friesen ran out of gas with three laps to go at the Digital Ally 250 NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series race at the Kansas Speedway.

“This is what sports is all about – comebacks man,” Chastain said after leading just five laps.

Friesen took the first two stages for the first time this season, but a costly mistake of leaving the pit box early with 42 laps to go left him without enough gas. He held the lead after a restart with 16 laps to go and led a race-high 87 laps on the 1 1/2-mile oval, but ended up 15th.

“We just can’t close it,” said Friesen, who was seeking his first Trucks win after five runner-up finishes. “I didn’t know we were taking four (tires). I thought for sure we were taking two. Just a lot of silence on the radio. That’s it.”

The winner of a NASCAR Xfinity Series race last year in Las Vegas, Chastain topped Ben Rhodes by 0.483 seconds. Chastain had earned a full-time ride in Ganassi’s No. 42 Xfinity Series Chevrolet for 2019, but that ride went away following an FBI raid on the program’s primary sponsor, DC Solar.

It's the Riverdale High graduate's first Trucks series victory in his 66th start and the first for Niece Motorsports. He's also the only driver to start the Trucks season with seven straight Top-10 finishes.

“Aw, man, this is what sports is all about,” Chastain told nascar.com, barely able to contain his emotions. “We had the world by the tail last fall, and everything got taken away from us. We didn’t quit, though … I’m going to celebrate this one a lot more than I did the last one.

“I thought, after the last one (in Las Vegas), they were going to come a lot more easy. But it’s not easy … I hate to see Stewie lose one like that. I know he’s been trying to win, but, yes — we got it!”

484,JACKSONVILLE MAN HIT BY VAN: Friend witnesses incident after traffic stop,"0 Woman sees friend hit by car as he ran from police

NEPTUNE BEACH, Fla. - A Jacksonville man is being treated for critical injuries after he was hit by a van in Neptune Beach, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. His friend says she witnessed him get hit.

This incident began after Genevieve Myatt was stopped by Neptune Beach Police for speeding Thursday evening. She was pulled over on the side of Atlantic Boulevard and Florida Boulevard.

Myatt said her friend, 50-year-old Thomas Bennett, got out of her car and became upset with the officer. She told Action News Jax exclusively that watched the confrontation transpire from the driver’s seat.

“When the police officer asked him to get down, he just didn’t comply,” Myatt said. “He wasn’t listening to what they were asking him to do.”

Police said Bennett became aggressive toward the officer and ripped his own shirt off. An officer shocked him with a stun gun, but they said it did not have much effect on Bennett.

The officer then pulled out his baton but didn’t use it because Bennett darted across Atlantic Boulevard. Myatt then watched her friend get hit by an oncoming minivan.

“Once I saw that he got hit, I immediately froze. I was terrified, I was upset,” Myatt said.

FHP began investigating the crash. They said Bennett suffered critical injuries and was taken to Memorial Hospital.

Action News Jax talked to the hospital Friday morning and learned that he was still being treated in the trauma center.

“I’m praying my friend is okay,” Myatt said. “I’m hoping he’s okay.”

Action News Jax asked Myatt why she believes Bennett became upset with police. She said her friend is “protective” over her and has been “going through a lot.”

Action News Jax reached out to police to learn if Bennett could face charges, and if the officer followed protocol during this traffic stop.

A man charged with bludgeoning and strangling to death a Hollywood television director more than three decades ago was arrested Thursday in North Carolina after police said DNA and a confession linked him to the crime.Edwin Hiatt was arrested in Burke County for the 1985 death of Barry Crane in Los Angeles. He has been charged with murder in California and will be returned there, Los Angeles police announced.A housekeeper found Crane, 57, dead in his garage in his Studio City townhouse on July 5, 1985. He was naked and had been wrapped in bedsheets. He had been beaten with a large ceramic statue and strangled with a telephone cord, the News Herald of Morgantown, North Carolina reported, citing court documents.Crane directed dozens of episodes of such hit 1970s and ’80s TV shows as “The Incredible Hulk, “Hawaii 5-O” and “The Six Million Dollar Man.” He also produced the show “The Magician” and was associate producer for “Mannix” and “Mission: Impossible.”He also was a world-class bridge player.There was no word on a motive for the killing.Crane’s death went unsolved until police said they matched a fingerprint from Crane’s stolen car to Hiatt last year. FBI investigators then obtained discarded cigarette butts and a coffee cup from the parking lot of the auto repair shop in Burke County where Hiatt worked.DNA from some items matched that from cigarette butts found in Crane’s stolen car, which was discovered shortly after his death on a mountain road, investigators said.On March 8, homicide detectives went to North Carolina to interview Hiatt.“During the interview, Hiatt admitted to killing Barry Crane,” an LAPD statement said.It wasn’t known whether Hiatt had a lawyer.Video from WSOC-TV showed Hiatt, 52, of Connelly Springs, being arrested. Hiatt, with long white hair and beard, held his handcuffed hands in front of him as he was taken to a car.Hiatt told the station that he didn’t remember Crane’s name until it was told to him and had no memory of what occurred so long ago except for “bits and pieces that were brought back to me just by suggestion.”Asked if he could have killed Crane, he replied: “Anything’s possible back then ... I was big into drugs.”“I just don’t want to remember the past,” he said, adding later: “It’s a different life today.”Co-workers told the News Herald that Hiatt was a generous and peaceful man.“He wouldn’t hurt a flea,” Dee Hall said.“This is something that supposedly happened 30 years ago, the man’s changed,” Hall said. “Christ has come in and he’s become a new creature.

The State Attorney's Office in Columbia County filed court documents Thursday saying it won't prosecute 23-year-old Dillon Shane Webb, who had been charged with obscenity and resisting an officer without violence. The filing said a valid defense could be raised under the First Amendment, which protects free speech.

Officials say the deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused. The deputy then charged Webb with resisting.

499,"Teen, man attacked by pack of bulldogs in Florida community","- Authorities say a pack of dogs attacked two people in a Florida neighborhood.

Pasco County Sheriff's officials tell news outlets that the pack which included three bulldogs bit a 15-year-old boy on the leg as he was on his way to school Thursday morning.

A short time later, the dogs attacked a man.

A sheriff's deputy fired shots at a dog after it tried to attack him. Officials say the deputy wasn't injured and the dog was euthanized at its owners' request.

Pasco County Animal Control took custody of the other two dogs. Two puppies that were with the dogs but not involved in the attack were returned to the owners.

500,"A Cape Coral mother will spend Mother's Day by newborn's bedside in hospital, hoping for good news","This year, Mother's Day won't mean as much to Kathryn Zarrillo as Tuesday will.

For most others, the 14th will be just like any other regular day of the week. But for Zarrillo, it means finding out whether she can take her newborn son home after an extended hospital stay that kept them from their family in Cape Coral for nearly a month.

Zarrillo hasn't been able to return to her teaching job since her son's birth, and her husband has been working overtime for the city of Cape Coral to support their family while she stays with the baby at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. Their daughter, Liliana, has been at home with her father.

""Hopefully, we'll be getting some answers on Tuesday,"" Zarrillo said over the phone from the hospital room, where she spends every day and night by her baby's bedside.

Canio Zarrillo was born six weeks premature on Jan. 19. He had been diagnosed with a genetic disorder called Noonan syndrome prior to his birth, so Zarrillo knew he might come early.

""But it was still a complete surprise,"" Zarrillo said. ""One minute I'm laying my daughter down to bed. The next minute, I'm like 'oh, my water broke'.""

Since then, the mom and son have been in and out of hospitals, sometimes for extended stays and other times for follow-up treatments.

They had their first fun outing about a month ago, when they went to their friend's home for a pre-Easter egg hunt.

""Everything was fun. Everyone looked cute,"" Zarrillo said. ""We took some cute pictures.""

The next day, after feeding from a bottle in the morning – ""a big deal for Canio to have a bottle,"" Zarillo said – his breathing started to grow labored.

Then it stopped. His heart soon would follow suit.

The family rushed the baby to Golisano Children's Hospital of Southwest Florida, a 20-minute drive from their Cape Coral home.

""By the time we got there, he was already turning blue,"" Zarrillo said. ""That's where our journey really started. His first few months of life have just been crazy. It's been a lot for my little man.""

Noonan syndrome is a condition that affects many areas of the body. It is characterized by mildly unusual facial features, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

For Canio, the disorder has caused heart problems and unusual facial features.

When he went into cardiac arrest in mid-April, his heart's left ventricle collapsed. Doctors had to pump him full of fluid to get his heart beating the way it should, Zarrillo said.

Then Canio's body started retaining fluid, and tests indicated lymphatic problems.

""My little 9-pound son turned into at least double his size, if not triple within a matter of a day,"" she said.

They spent 10 days at the Southwest Florida hospital. On April 24, patches of Canio's skin started turning purple, Zarrillo said.

Doctors transferred him to the children's hospital on the east coast via a med flight. He's improved since then, achieving more normal fluid levels.

But the distance has been tough on the family, and especially on Zarrillo's daughter Liliana, who turns 3 next month, she said. The little girl wanted to hold her baby brother all the time when Zarrillo first brought him home, she said.

Liliana Zarrillo holds her baby brother, Canio. (Photo: Special to the New-Press)

""What do you tell an almost 3-year-old that her little brother isn't home because there's something wrong with him?"" Zarrillo asked. ""We tell her he's at the hospital getting strong, but she can't go see him because she's too little.""

Zarrillo hasn't seen Liliana since April 24, she said.

""Not being able to see my little girl for so long has really pulled on my heart so much,"" Zarrillo said. ""This has been a big wait-and-see game. The waiting and the seeing is very, very, very, very draining. I can’t do anything except for hope the doctors are doing the best thing for my son.""

There is some light at the tunnel, she said.

She'll return home and back to work for the last day of school, where she'll see her fifth graders off as they prepare to transition into middle school, she said. And she'll plan a small birthday party for Liliana, with Minnie Mouse cupcakes.

A friend has set up a GoFundMe page to help the family with the mounting expenses as her husband works overtime to support the family on one salary.

And she keeps her favorite picture of Canio, taken the day before they went to the emergency room, hanging in his hospital room so everyone can see what he looked like before all the feeding tubes, fluid retention and skin discoloration. Zarrillo said the picture shows what ""normal"" looks like for him.

""We take each day as it comes. Some days we take each hour as it comes,"" Zarrillo said. ""Sometimes you've just got to take what you can when you can take it and be grateful for every little minute, because they count.""

502,Ride along with Miami Gardens Police Department's bike unit,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - On a steamy night in late April, Miami Gardens police officers on bicycle patrol were heading to reports of a shooting, when they heard a house alarm blaring.

At Northwest 196th Lane and 33rd Court, officers dismounted, drew their weapons, and surrounded the house.

A neighbor told officers he saw a man trying to break into his house, so they suspected a criminal could be inside this adjacent one, too.

After a police K-9 was called to clear the home, it was determined the suspected burglar was gone. The homeowners arrived, relieved that officers had responded to the house so quickly.

That was just another night for the bike unit, which some Miami Gardens residents said they never even knew about.

It’s a team of cops on two wheels that saturates areas after crimes are committed, and patrols areas during the day to get to know the neighbors.

According to Capt. Joseph Nargiso, there are 64 bike-certified officers in the department. Their goal is very different than of those who work road patrol or undercover details.

“It's totally opposite. What we do here is we're very visible with the community,” Nargiso said.

Occasionally Chief Delma Noel-Pratt gears up to ride, too.

“When we're on our bikes, it's open air. We get to see people closer. Face to face,” she said.

Miami Gardens crime has made headlines in the last several weeks.

There have been two fatal shootings this week alone. A toddler was reported attacked and beaten inside a recycling bin the week before.

And there have been two high-profile homicides, including that of well-known grandmother Danette Simmons. A suspect who lives nearby was recently arrested.

FDLE records show overall crime has increased in the city from 2016 to 2017, and again in 2018. More recent numbers for the last half of 2018 and 2019 were not yet available from the state.

Byron Johnson, who normally rides with the motorcycle unit but is also bicycle-certified, said he prefers to be on two wheels to be more visible. He thinks he can make a better connection with people in the community in order to fight crime.

He likes that people can see his face.

""If the people in the community don't know who you are, how can you expect them to come tell you anything?"" he said.

506,Two people surrender to police after standoff on West Lloyd Street,"CLOSE A SWAT team begins to move toward a home on West Lloyd Street where a man allegedly fired shots. Colin Warren-Hicks, Pensacola

Two people surrendered to authorities Friday after a more than two-hour standoff with law enforcement at a home on West Lloyd Street where a person had barricaded themselves inside.

One man and one woman were taken into police custody. As of 5 p.m. Friday, authorities had not released their names or announced charges against them.

The two people surrendered shortly before noon after the SWAT team, carrying AR-15 assault rifles and at least one shotgun, approached the home.

Shots were fired at 9:31 a.m. in the backyard of the house at 1101 W. Lloyd St. and law enforcement was notified a minute later, according to Pensacola Police Department spokesman Mike Wood.

Officers arrived at the house at 9:34 a.m., at which time, the person who had fired the shots had retreated inside and barricaded themselves inside the home, Wood said.

By 9:50 a.m., officers had encircled the house near the corner of Lloyd and G streets and closed streets within a one-block radius of the intersection to both car and pedestrian traffic. All neighbors were advised to take shelter.

Officers attempted to contact the person inside the home via megaphone, a house phone line and cellphones to no avail, Wood said. A warning over the megaphone stated that a SWAT team was en route, but no one inside the home responded, according to authorities.

Isaiah Henry, 40, of Pensacola, was riding his bike north on H Street around 9:45 a.m. when he encountered one of the roadblocks around West Lloyd Street.

""I've lived here all my life and seen a lot of crazy stuff, but this really tops it all,"" he said. ""This is a quiet neighborhood.""

Henry said he has a child who lives several blocks away with their mother.

""It’s really shocking, really. Other than the regular traffic stop, you really don’t see this type of thing around here,” Henry said, gesturing toward a scene of law enforcement cruisers, trucks, crime scene tape and busy investigators.

Nearby, one school had been placed on lockdown.

All teachers and children at the A.A. Dixon Early Head Start Center at 1201 North H St. were forced to remain in their classrooms until the standoff ended, according to the school’s social services advocate.

The school is approximately two blocks from 1101 W. Lloyd St. and was less than 200 yards from the police’s mobile command center. Escambia County School District Superintendent Malcolm Thomas confirmed no other schools went on lockdown due to Friday’s incident.

Emergency response vehicles continued to arrive throughout the morning as police parked SUVs with flashing lights in the center of streets, further fortifying their roadblocks.

By 11 a.m., the SWAT team arrived and began to assemble a block away from the barricaded home. Shortly after 11:45 a.m., SWAT members wearing body armor moved as a unit down the street.

By 11:56 a.m., police announced two suspects had surrendered to authorities. Following standard protocol, SWAT cleared the house. The team checked for additional suspects but found none.

""The house has been cleared. It is all over,"" Wood said at 12:02 p.m.

507,Police capture Alabama murder suspect in Jacksonville Beach,"JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla. - A man wanted in connection with an Alabama murder case was taken into custody Thursday afternoon in Jacksonville Beach, authorities said.

Lucas Ray Kemp, 18, of Huntsville, Alabama, was among three people detained about 12:45 p.m. at the beach near 1st Street South, according to the Jacksonville Beach Police Department.

Of the three, Kemp was the only individual arrested as there was an active warrant out for his arrest stemming from an unspecified murder and burglary in Madison, Alabama, a suburb of Huntsville.

The two others detained by police were questioned and released once local investigators learned that they were viewed as witnesses in the Alabama case, the police department stated in a news release.

Officers were alerted to Kemp’s presence after a pickup truck sought by investigators in Madison was found parked in the area, the release said. Shortly afterward, Kemp was taken into custody nearby.

Sgt. Larry Smith said Thursday's arrest was a great example of how technology can help police.

""The license plate readers in our surrounding jurisdictions alerted us to the vehicle being in our area. Subsequently, leading to the arrest of an out of state murder suspect,"" Smith said.

Kemp was taken to the Duval County jail, where he remains in custody on a warrant as a fugitive from justice, jail logs show. It’s unclear when he’ll be extradited back to Alabama.

512,Police search for man on bicycle inappropriately touching students,"- Law enforcement officials are looking for a man who reportedly touched two students at two Orlando schools.

The incidents were reported on Monday morning. Parents told The News Station both Boone High School and Blankner Elementary went on brief lockdowns.



According to Orlando Police, around 6:30 in the morning, a Boone High School student was on Ferncreek Avenue walking to school when a man touched her inappropriately.

About two and a half hours later, Orange County Sheriffs Deputies said a student was walking to Blankner Elementary next door, when a man came up behind her and also touched her inappropriately.

During both incidents, the victims said the man was on a bicycle.

The schools sent a message to parents, Monday, advising students to walk in groups. “I’m picking them up, and right now she had an activity she wanted to go by herself walking around the neighborhood, and that’s a no-no for now,” said one parent.

Detectives plan to release a suspect sketch tomorrow. The suspect was described as a black male, 19-20 years of age, 5'6""-5'7"", short curly hair, clean-shaven, medium build, red t-shirt, Khakhi long pants, and dark tennis shoes.

516,Man faces attempted murder charge in Nassau County shooting,"FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. - A North Carolina man wanted in connection with a March shooting in Amelia Island has been taken into custody, according to the Nassau County Sheriff’s Office.

Christian Edwards, 21, was arrested last week in St. Pauls, North Carolina, on a warrant charging him with attempted murder and armed robbery and returned to Nassau County on Wednesday.

Edwards is suspected in the March 31 shooting of a 20-year-old man who showed up at Baptist Medical Center Nassau about 3 p.m. that day with a gunshot wound to the leg.

The unnamed victim was later airlifted to UF Health Jacksonville with serious injuries. His condition wasn’t immediately known Thursday morning.

A warrant was issued for Edwards’ arrest after investigators received information about the shooting, which unfolded near a home on Friendly Road off State Road 200 in Fernandina Beach, deputies said.

Deputies said a witness saw two men then heard gunfire near the home where the shooting happened March 31. Shortly after, the same witness recalled seeing two vehicles drive away from the scene.

521,South Florida man arrested after fatally shooting neighbor during dog dispute,"Police say Ian Stefan fatally shot another man who confronted Stefan about walking his dog without a leash.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A South Florida man was arrested Thursday after fatally shooting his neighbor during a dispute about a dog, police said.

Ian Stefan, 26, of West Palm Beach, faces a charge of second-degree murder.

West Palm Beach police said Stefan shot and killed Slobodan Jakovljevic, 68, during a Feb. 5 argument at the Park Place Apartments.

According to a probable cause affidavit, Stefan was walking his dog through the complex without a leash when Jakovljevic confronted him about it.

""Stefan responded, but the response is unknown,"" which upset Jakovljevic, Detective Andrea Branch wrote in the affidavit.

Jakovljevic charged at Stefan with his fists clinched, at which time Stefan pulled out a gun and shot Jakovljevic in the chest, police said.

According to the affidavit, ""no words or physical altercation ensued as Jakovljevic was moving toward Stefan.""

Stefan then called 911.

""I was about to be attacked for not having my dog on a leash by a man I've had previous issues with,"" Stefan told the 911 dispatcher, police said.

Stefan went on to say that he was scared for his life when he pulled out his gun. Police said he had a permit to carry a concealed weapon.

When the 911 dispatcher asked Stefan if he shot somebody, Stefan replied, ""Yes, I did.""

But police said Stefan did not try to help Jakovljevic after the shooting, refusing to administer CPR.

""He's completely blooded out and he's not breathing anymore. I'm sorry,"" Stefan told the 911 dispatcher, police said.

Members of the homeowners association told police ""there were only a few issues"" between the men, involving Stefan's dog not being on a leash and Stefan not reporting guests to security.

""No board member interviewed during this investigation ever witnessed anything physical between Stefan and Jakovlevic,"" the affidavit said.

The investigation concluded that Stefan's actions were ""imminently dangerous and there is no reasonable explanation for him to have shot and killed Slobodan Jakovljevic over a strictly verbal dispute involving an unleashed dog,"" Branch wrote.

The test launch was part of the U.S. Navy Strategic Systems Programs' demonstration. (Photo: John Kowalski, U.S. Navy)

The U.S. Navy successfully tested an unarmed Trident II D5 missile off the coast of Cape Canaveral last week, even as North Korea carried out its own short-range missile launches the same day.

The Trident II D5 – an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of just over 1,200 miles – was launched Thursday from the USS Rhode Island with coordination with the U.S. Navy's Strategic Systems Programs.

The launch came the same day the U.S. conducted another ICBM test in California. An unarmed Minuteman III missile was launched as part of an operational test north of Vandenberg Air Force Base, according to U.S. Strategic Command in Nebraska.

The launch off Cape Canaveral was the 172nd successful test flight of the solid-fuel, three-stage Trident II D5 missile, which can carry up to 12 warheads. The purpose of the offshore test on May 9 was to test the readiness of the weapon system, which can be used to deliver nuclear-tipped warheads as part of the U.S.’ strike capability.

“I’m incredibly proud of Team King’s Bay and the Rhode Island crew. They’ve spent the last nine months preparing for this test and the patrols that will follow. Because of their hard work and dedication, our sea-based deterrent remains the most survivable and reliable in the world,” said Rear Adm. Michael Bernacchi, Commander, Submarine Group 10, in a statement issued Thursday.

The launch off Cape Canaveral – one of a number that have taken place in the area over the years – came shortly after North Korea was reported to have launched two short-range missiles of its own, alarming its regional neighbors just weeks after failed talks between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in March, according to media reports.

“While we’ve demonstrated today that our efforts to extend the life of our existing D5 missiles and SSBNs are successful, it is imperative that we remain focused on the Navy’s number one priority: on-time delivery of the first Colombia-class submarine,” said Behning in the statement.

The USS Rhode Island Rhode Island, an Ohio-class submarine is one of five ballistic-missile submarines homeported at Kings Bay, Georgia.

529,Man claims self-defense after allegedly stabbing man who spit on his car,"- Hillsborough County Assistant State Attorney Jay Pruner says Teddy Baltimore Smith killed a man for no reason.

""If you believe the evidence, a person who stabs another person for spitting on a car window presents a danger to the community. [The victim] lost his life over nothing,“ Pruner told a courtroom Friday.

Smith, however, says the stabbing death of Gilbert Serna was self-defense. He's using Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' law to try and win immunity from prosecution.

Smith claims the day of the incident, Serna spat through the passenger's side window of a Dodge Ram pickup onto Smiths car.

An angry Smith got out of his car to confront Serna, but Smith claims Serna was the aggressor.

Continue reading below

""He believed [Serna] was reaching for what he believed was a machete in the bed of the truck,"" explained attorney Anthony Rickman, who is not involved in the case.

During Smith's bond hearing, detective Neal Smith described what happened next.

""He reached over with his right hand and stabs the passenger in the chest area,"" said the detective.

Serna died of his injuries and Smith took off in his black BMW.

Jeffery Hunter, who was the driving the pickup, confirmed his passenger, Gilbert Serna, was aggressive.

Now the question is: Was Smith justified in using deadly force?

Rickman says prosecutors have plenty to work with, ""if the defendant was in fear for hs life if he felt it was necessary that he was defending himself then why did he flee, why did he leave the scene, why did he run?"" questioned Rickman.

Tiffany Bannworth looks into the faces of her seven children and sees her husband.

They are all she has left of the man who'd been her life partner for nearly 20 years. Stephen Bannworth died in August in a Fort Myers motorcycle crash.

This Mother's Day, the Cape Coral mother will celebrate each of the boys they created and the miracle daughter born nine months after his death with a nice dinner and family outing.

""We're replacing a bad memory with remembrance of happiness and celebration,"" she said of the holidays and anniversaries since their lives upended.

The six boys look like their dad Stephen Bannworth at different stages of his life, she said, as she cradles his final gift in her arms.

Amunet Corencia Pearl Bannworth arrived on Good Friday. The 35-year-old mother gave her the moniker they'd decided upon if it was girl during a 2007 pregnancy, their third.

""He would recognize it anywhere,"" she said of their daughter's name. Amunet is the Egyptian goddess of mystery. She joins siblings Dante, Cairo, Jasper, Roman, Quinton and Kipling Bannworth. A seventh son, Gatsby Bannworth, died six years ago at 3 months old.

Oldest son Dante, 16, said last year started out ""great at first,"" the six boys and their parents taking weekend outings and enjoying their time with one another.

Then, his father's death abruptly changed their trajectory.

""Now it sucks because my dad wanted a girl,"" Dante Bannworth said, his father's prayers answered in death, only never to see her.

Stephen Bannworth was a stay-at-home dad. He and Tiffany met and courted, having Dante when Tiffany was 19. Stephen supported her dreams, saw her through college and her doctorate.

She is now executive director at Nicaea Academy of Southwest Florida, a birth through college education facility in Cape Coral. Amunet sleeps in her mother's office, all six boys always nearby, attending classes.

The family's closeness is no surprise. It's what Stephen Bannworth cultivated, Tiffany Bannworth said.

Tiffany and Stephen Bannworth were with each other every day — a streak of 3,992 of them — since Sept. 1, 2007, she said. If she went on a quick archaeology trip — one of her many interests and qualifications — she left Saturday morning and returned Sunday night, making sure they kissed good-bye and hello.

Tiffany, an only child, had always known Stephen wanted a big family.

The Bannworth family is nearly three times the size of the average family. The U.S. Census Bureau counted about 83.09 million families with an average of 3.14 persons in 2018, down from 3.7 in the 1960s.

Dante was the first baby Tiffany Bannworth ever held. Within weeks, she told Stephen she wanted more. Lots more.

Four years after Dante, the Bannworths had five more sons within six years.

Their sixth, Gatsby, died in his sleep three months after his birth.

""We thought that was the unthinkable,"" she said. But Stephen held the family together.

""He was so strong and cultivated a tight-knit family,"" she said. ""A part of our hearts were missing. He carried us through the grief.""

Within the year, son Kipling was born, and Stephen understood Tiffany's fears of losing another child.

""I was scared it could happen again,"" Tiffany Bannworth said. ""He said he would quit his job and watch Kipling until he went to school.""

He kept that promise: Kipling started kindergarten days after Stephen's death.

In the years between, Stephen Bannworth washed their clothes, cooked and cleaned and did all the home repairs himself.

""Some people thought he was just some schlub,"" she said. ""He was so incredible. He was more of a man than I could ever imagine meeting.""

Their passion lasted their entire marriage.

Over the summer, the family car needed replacing.

While waiting on a new vehicle to arrive last August, Stephen Bannworth would take Tiffany to work on the back of his motorcycle. He did so the Saturday before his death.

He would park across from the main building on campus and rev the engine as she walked across the lot.

""He'd blow kisses and wink,"" she said. ""I still got flustered. We were really love struck.""

She drove the new vehicle to school for the first time the morning he died. He had fixed the locks on the vehicle to prepare it for use the day before. He'd also repaired the curio cabinet glass, cleaned the house and washed every bit of laundry, not knowing he wouldn't return from his motorcycle ride.

She remembers the acute feeling of loss in the days after his death — she didn't have a single stitch of clothing remaining that carried his scent.

""The glaring absence of him was noticed by me,"" she said, adding she was in her bed, crying to God: ""Let me be pregnant with his last child.'""

Then, when her pregnancy was confirmed six weeks later, ""How blessed I felt. What a miracle it was.""

Friends, family and even strangers stepped up to help fill the void. A GoFundMe campaign raised more than $12,000; a woman linked to the Nicaea school paid for the entire funeral. Christmas came and people showered the family with gift cards.

People told her stories about how Stephen had helped them, without her ever knowing.

On the weekend that would have been their wedding anniversary, friends gathered to celebrate the couple. The next day, Tiffany Bannworth said, 50 people came to her baby shower.

On her birthday Tuesday, the school's students gathered around a store-bought birthday cake with the bright yellow icing, macaroons and doughnuts. Her sons surrounded her, Amunet on her lap, as everyone sang 'Happy Birthday.""

It's a new memory, to complement the other birthdays where Stephen would make any kind of cake she asked.

""It's difficult to be away from him,"" she said. ""There's never going to be another man like Steve.""

As Mother's Day loomed, she reflected on what she learned from the man she knew she could spend several lifetimes with and follow the example he set.

""He was very loving and doting and protective and very pure,"" she said. "" ... Co-parenting with him was a piece of cake.""

That they are a strong family and going through life together shows in how the brothers have welcomed Amunet.

""They are very protective of her,"" Tiffany Bannworth said, ""especially (Kipling). They don't want anybody to touch her.""

She will spend her Mother's Day, the first having a daughter, thinking about the man who helped her become a mom and making memories with the six versions of himself he left behind.

""This was a day that Stevie lavished me with gifts and attention,"" she said. He'd take the boys to a thrift store to look for antique glass.

""I have a big collection, but I refuse to spend a lot of money on it,"" she said. ""That used to bug Steve. He liked to buy me expensive things, but I liked the novelty of finding it for next to nothing.

""This year there will be none of that.""

She planned to cook a nice dinner on Saturday, inviting her mother to join them.

She cherishes the memories Stephen left her with, their last morning together and their final embrace.

""Boy, would I kill for another kiss from my husband,"" she said.

560,Clearwater man has warning for pet owners after Yorkie killed by coyotes,"CLEARWATER, Fla. (WFLA) - A Clearwater man is warning neighbors to keep their pets protected and yards secure after he says coyotes snatched and killed his small dog.

James Devito has lived on Sharkey Road for four years and says he's never seen as many coyotes running around as he has in the last six months. When he can, he tries to grab photos or videos of coyotes in his yard on his cell phone.

It's been a week and a half since Devito says coyotes carried off his tiny Yorkie named “Gucci.”

Devito said he let Gucci out to go to the bathroom in his screen-in pool area like he did every night. But suddenly, he heard a loud yelp.

He went outside and the dog was nowhere to be found.

“I mean, they're huge. One is like 40-50 lbs,” Devito said.

By law, Devito can hire a trapper to take care of the coyotes.

But he said he hates the idea of paying hundreds of dollars to have them killed.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission doesn’t offer a relocation program.

“What they should do is they should trap them and maybe neuter them. People say, ‘oh we're taking over their land.’ That's not true there’s been no new building here, they're just reproducing,” Devito said.

The day after Gucci disappeared, Devito installed motion sensor lights all around his property.

He’s also vowed to watch his other dogs like a hawk, never letting them out without having something to keep the coyotes at bay.

“If you've got a little dog 10 pounds and under, even if you have them on a leash, I'd be very hesitant about walking without having some type of a pole or bat or something. To just beat them off because they're hungry,” he said.

HOLIDAY, Fla. (WFLA) - Authorities in Pasco County are searching for a man who approached two young girls before school Thursday and asked them for sex acts.

The sheriff's office says it happened just before 8 a.m. while the two girls were waiting for their bus. The girls were at the intersection of Ironware Drive and Pleasure Drive when they say the man approached them.

According to deputies, the man asked both girls if they would perform sexual acts on him. When the girls' bus started to approach the intersection, the man drove off.

""The brazenness of someone to pull up to juvenile females just waiting to go to school - it's getting toward the end of the school year - and just ask them outright for sexual things, that's absolutely disgusting,"" said Amanda Hunter, the public information officer for the sheriff's office.

The suspect is described as a white man with a brown goatee who is about 25 to 35 years old. He was seen in a silver four-door sedan.

It's game over for a Cape Coral man found guilty of stealing a Nintendo Switch gaming system in December.

Kyle Sullivan's Mario, Final Fantasy and Zelda games are on pause for the next five-and-a-half years — the time he'll spend behind bars, according to a news release issued Thursday from the Office of the State's Attorney, 20th Judicial Circuit.

Sullivan, 36, was sentenced in prison followed by a year of probation after he was earlier found guilty of one count of burglary of a dwelling and one count of grand theft, according to a release from the Office of the State's Attorney, 20th Judicial Circuit.

He was sentenced as a habitual felony offender on both counts which led to increased prison time, the release indicated.

The theft happened on Dec. 4 when the defendant entered the victim’s open garage at a Cape Coral home and removed a Nintendo Switch game system.

The theft was captured on home surveillance and Sullivan was identified based on a work shirt he had been wearing. The defendant’s employer confirmed his identity on the video.

After being arrested Sullivan showed where he had put the stolen item.

571,Man sentenced to 90 days in jail for jumping on pelican in Florida Keys,"MONROE COUNTY, Fla. - A Maryland man who was found guilty of two counts of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and two counts of animal cruelty was sentenced to 90 days in the Monroe County Detention Center.

William Hardesty, 31, who posted a video on Facebook of himself jumping on a pelican March 5 in the Florida Keys, will receive a 40-day credit for time served. He was also fined $1,000 and will serve a year of probation upon his release from jail.

The video that was posted to Facebook the first week of March shows Hardesty, of Riva, Maryland, luring a pelican toward a dock with a fish. As the pelican approached, Hardesty jumped from the dock and grabbed the pelican in the water. The pelican struggled with Hardesty to get free and at one point the bird bit him.

""Yeah, they bite hard!!!"" Hardesty wrote on Facebook.

The posting was met with widespread criticism and was followed by Hardesty posting that he might want to eat a pelican and was considering getting a pelican tattoo.

Hardesty's attorney asked Judge Mark Wilson for a sentence of jail time served, but Assistant State Attorney Ryan Maher requested Hardesty be sentenced to six months in jail followed by a year of probation because of the lack of remorse for his actions, as well as his lack of respect for nature and respect for Florida laws.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Monroe County Sheriff's Office are also investigating another post that showed Hardesty posing with what appears to be a Key deer inside a home, authorities said.

Mike Walton tells Tampa television station WFTS that he was stuck by a fish hook while fishing about 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast of Palm Harbor on Saturday. He later went to a hospital, where he received antibiotics for his hand, which had started swelling.

Walton says that by Easter Sunday, there were black bubbles growing on his injured hand. He was rushed to Tampa General Hospital where infectious disease doctors began treating him.

He says doctors considered amputating his arm, but were able to remove bacteria.

Walton said he's expected to be released from the hospital Thursday and will be on antibiotics for a month.

577,"North Fort Myers, Dunbar and Riverdale knock the rust off in spring football scrimmage","CLOSE North Fort Myers hosted Dunbar, Riverdale and perennial power Venice as part of a controlled scrimmage in spring football workouts leading up to spring games the next 2 weeks. Bryan Cooney, bcooney@news-press.com

After a play that resulted in a North Fort Myers defensive lineman jumping offside and a Red Knights assistant coach throwing his hands up in disbelief, Red Knights head coach Dwayne Mack flashed a big smile.

""It's just the spring man!"", Mack bellowed out. ""We're going to be fine!""

Saturday morning was not your ordinary spring practice session for three of Lee County's top programs as North Fort Myers hosted Dunbar, Riverdale and perennial power Venice in a structured scrimmage setting. With teams getting a total of 20 practice days including their official spring game to work with before the summer, Mack touted the session as a success for all.

""I think today was a huge success for everybody because you're getting reps on a Saturday and usually you are at home,"" Mack said. ""You only get 20 days and your 20th day is your spring game so we wanted to get a competitive edge going inviting these teams. We tried to bring some of the best teams from the area from last year together.""

In 2018, the four programs went a combined 37-12 and all made state playoff appearances. While the scrimmage was just an opportunity for the teams to get to practice against a different colored jersey, the three Lee County programs will see each other in the regular season.

Dunbar head coach Sammy Brown and his Tigers will meet the Riverdale in their season opener at home on Aug. 23 and will travel to play Mack's Red Knights on Oct. 11. Entering his fourth year at the helm for Dunbar, Brown has been very pleased with the work his team has put in throughout the spring.

""So far, we've been doing pretty well as the spring is a good evaluation period of where your team is at,"" Brown said. ""Today, everyone got a lot of reps and the kids got to knock some of the rust off. It was a big deal to have four very good programs together, see everybody. We've been practicing well, we've been pretty fortunate with the weather.""

The Tigers will have to replace a number of key seniors from a season ago as Derick Hunter Jr., Seneca Milledge and Major Williams all will be college freshmen. Brown pointed to a few standouts in the spring that fans will need to pay attention to as the next wave of Dunbar standouts.

""Jarques Riggins at quarterback, Greg Thomas at receiver and Bobby Dennis also at receiver has been a bright spot for us,"" Brown said. ""We're happy with what we've got. We'll finish up spring with our game at Port Charlotte next Friday, get into our summer lifting and then head into 7-on-7's. We'll be at UCF (June) the first, Miami on the eighth and Florida State on the 15th.""

Riverdale will also need to rely on newcomers to step into the place of multiple contributors that graduated including running back Quantavious Brown. Raiders defensive coordinator Steve Howard said that Saturday was an important day to get a gauge of where the team is at.

""To see our guys going up against quality opponents like North, Dunbar and having Venice come down here was really good,"" Howard said. ""It was a really good atmosphere and a good way to test the mettle of our kids.""

Riverdale's spring will conclude with their game next Friday against Hardee, another team that had an undefeated regular season in 2018 but fell in their opening round game in the state playoffs. The challenge of replacing not only playmakers such as Brown but having depth in key areas in the trenches and in the secondary will be a challenge for Raiders head coach James Delgado and company.

""We don't have a big group of seniors, but they are taking the younger guys under their wing,"" Howard said. ""I think overall we're moving in the right direction, we lost a lot to graduation and we've got a lot of young kids year-wise but also experience-wise. Today was a live test to not say that you're a young pup anymore and Hardee will be another test for them moving forward as a team.""

North Fort Myers will be another program needing to fill in holes left behind by a talented senior class that included Shomari Mason, Jesse Charles, Clayton Savinsky, Hunter Kobylanski and James Buchanan. Experience at the quarterback position will be there in 2019 as Parker O'Dell transferred in from Cape Coral, and he will have a veteran offensive line headlined by Blaise Sparks to protect him.

For Mack, building off a strong first year at North Fort Myers will be a challenge that he looks for the Red Knights to meet as they will finish their spring with their game against Cypress Lake May 23.

""It's been a positive spring, but there's a lot for us to work on,"" Mack said. ""Today I saw some good things that were exciting, the kids were physical, getting to the ball. I hope we can carry this energy with us to Cypress Lake on the 23rd.""

579,Former Palm Bay deputy manager Dave Isnardi arrested,"PALM BAY, Fla. - An arrest warrant has been issued for former Palm Bay Deputy City Manager Dave Isnardi on charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit extortion and conspiracy to possess controlled substances including oxycodone, News 6 partner Florida Today reported.

Isnardi is the husband of Brevard County Commissioner Kristine Isnardi.

It is unclear whether or not Isnardi has actually been arrested.

A second man, Jose Aguiar, a former candidate for the Palm Bay City Council, was arrested Friday morning and charged with racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering. Aguiar was convicted of conspiracy to sell cocaine in Massachusetts in 1997 and was sentenced to three years and one month in federal prison. It is not clear when he moved to Palm Bay.

The arrest warrants for the two show that the FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement have been investigating allegations of corruption and undue influence on city officials in Palm Bay since at least 2015. The warrants draw heavily from secret recordings made by a confidential source working with investigators.

The arrest warrants for the two paint a picture of Palm Bay’s city government embroiled in scandal. Though not arrested or charged, the warrants allege that City Councilman Jeff Bailey had an addiction to oxycodone and that former Councilman Tres Holton regularly had sex with prostitutes and used cocaine. It also alleges that Holton had obtained prostitutes for Mayor William Capote while the men were in Tallahassee.

The arrest warrants allege Isnardi and Aguiar were plotting to record Holton and Bailey having sex with prostitutes at “the Clubhouse,” a Canova Street home then owned by Aguiar, where Holton, Bailey and other Palm Bay officials hung out. They then planned to use those recordings to blackmail Holton and Bailey into voting the way Aguiar wanted on various issues including rezoning a property that Aguiar owned to allow him to open a scrap metal business that Isnardi would be a partner in.

“Is this a joke?” Holton said, when contacted by Florida Today and told the allegations against him in the arrest warrants. “You’re going to have to call me back,” Holton said, not responding further to questions.

The warrants also say that Isnardi and Aguiar plotted to plant drugs in Bailey’s car and arrange for a Brevard County sheriff’s deputy to perform a traffic stop on Bailey and to discover the drugs. The warrants also state that former City Manager Gregg Lynk was aware of the plot to set up Bailey, but didn’t want to know the details or participate in the effort.

Capote said he was surprised to learn from Florida Today that his name was mentioned in the arrest warrant as being connected with prostitutes.

He said those allegations are untrue.

“I don’t know who would tell someone that,” Capote said. “That’s profound. This is all new to me. That accusation has no validity.”

Capote said he has been in Tallahassee in the past on city business, meeting with state legislators and other state officials, but he did not hang out with Holton while he was there.

Capote says people may have been trying to taint him for political reasons.

Capote said he was never interviewed by investigators, and that he has no reason to secure a lawyer in this matter.

It also alleges that Holton had obtained prostitutes for Mayor William Capote while the men were in Tallahassee.

The arrest warrants allege Isnardi and Aguiar were plotting to record Holton and Bailey having sex with prostitutes at “the Clubhouse,” a Canova Street home then owned by Aguiar, where Holton, Bailey and other Palm Bay officials hung out. They then planned to use those recordings to blackmail the Holton and Bailey into voting the way Aguiar wanted on various issues including rezoning a property that Aguiar owned to allow him to open a scrap metal business that Isnardi would be a partner in.

“Is this a joke?” Holton said, when contacted by FLORIDA TODAY and told the allegations against him in the arrest warrants. “You’re going to have to call me back,” Holton said, not responding further to questions.

The warrants also say that Isnardi and Aguiar plotted to plant drugs in Bailey’s car and arrange for a Brevard County sheriff’s deputy to perform a traffic stop on Bailey and to discover the drugs. The warrants also state that former City Manager Gregg Lynk was aware of the plot to set up Bailey, but didn’t want to know the details or participate in the effort.

The warrants also indicate that Aguiar had previously supplied Bailey with drugs.

In a subsequent interview with the FBI, set up by Isnardi's attorney John Murphy, Isnardi admitted to participating in discussions about trying to record Holton and Bailey in compromising positions, according to the arrest documents.

But he denied there was an actual plot plant drugs in Bailey's car. He did admit, though, that contacted Brevard County Sheriff's Office Agent Jason West about the possibility that there were drugs in Bailey's car and noted that Bailey ""was doing drugs anyway.

Ultimately, Isnardi claimed the plot was only ""guys talking s---, drinking beers and smoking cigars,"" according to the arrest documents.

Capote said he was surprised to learn from FLORIDA TODAY that his name was mentioned in the arrest warrant as being connected with prostitutes.

He said those allegations are untrue.

“I don’t know who would tell someone that,” Capote said. “That’s profound. This is all new to me. That accusation has no validity.”

Capote said he has been in Tallahassee in the past on city business, meeting with state legislators and other state officials, but he did not hang out with Holton while he was there.

Capote says people may have been trying to taint him for political reasons.

Capote said he was never interviewed by investigators, and that he has no reason to secure a lawyer in this matter.

585,"Dog walker, 5 dogs killed when man fleeing police slams into car","Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Pet owners and others gathered at a Southern California intersection to mourn a popular dog walker killed along with five of six dogs she was transporting when a motorist fleeing police crashed into her car.

Dog owners and friends of Jessica Bingaman held candles and sang at a Wednesday night vigil in Long Beach, south of Los Angeles.

“She was a beloved human being that cared for dogs; that cared for everybody,” an emotional Ann Hovatter told KABC-TV .

Hovatter’s dog Scout was among the pets killed.

“She loved Jessie so much,” Hovatter told KTLA-TV as she showed a photo of her German shepherd.

Bingaman’s mother arrived from Frackville, Pennsylvania, and was amazed by the turnout. “I know she was loved,” said Donann Lawson.

Lawson told KCBS-TV in an interview before the vigil that seeing video of the suspect sitting handcuffed on the curb while her daughter had to be cut out of the wreck “did no justice for me.” She also said she understands police have a job to do, but questioned what warrants a pursuit.

Police Chief Robert Luna came to the vigil and spoke to the mother, the station reported.

“On behalf of the men and women of the Long Beach Police Department — our condolences. We’re hurt, and to mom, I’m so sorry. On behalf of our city, so sorry,” he said.

Alisha Blanchard, a friend of the victim, said she created a GoFundMe page to raise funds for Bingaman’s 10-year-old daughter as well as the families’ whose dogs died.

The crash happened Tuesday morning as officers were pursuing a stolen van whose driver refused to stop, police said.

Bingaman, 41, was pronounced dead at a hospital. Four dogs died at the scene and a fifth died at a pet hospital.

A police statement said the sixth dog was released from the hospital to its owners.

After treatment for minor injuries, Javier Olivarez, 43, of Los Angeles was booked into jail for investigation of evading a police officer, felony DUI, vehicular manslaughter, and grand theft auto. Police said he also had an outstanding no-bail warrant for violation of a supervision order following release from a case involving a robbery. No details of that matter were provided.

The police statement said detectives were expected to present their case to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office. Olivarez remained jailed with no bail. It was unclear if he had retained legal representation.",http://www.wfla.com/national/dog-walker-5-dogs-killed-when-man-fleeing-police-slams-into-car/1994040557,2019-05-10T08:37:08Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

595,Man accused of breaking into Wilton Manors thrift store,"WILTON MANORS, Fla. - A man has been arrested after detectives said he broke into a popular Wilton Manors thrift shift shop that funds a nonprofit organization last month.

According to police spokesperson Jennifer Bickhardt, Devante Allen was arrested early Wednesday morning and taken to the Broward County Jail.

Allen faces a charge of burglary.

Surveillance video from April 14 shows a man in a T-shirt and shorts breaking into the front door of the Hidden Treasures Thrift Store in the 2200 block of Northwest Ninth Avenue, then taking the cash register once he makes his way inside.

Executive Director Sue Martino said she received a phone call from her alarm company and directed them to call police.

Martino said proceeds from the thrift store fund the Pet Project, a nonprofit organization that helps people who can't take care of their pets because of illness or financial hardship.

596,Minor cut leads to flesh-eating infection on Florida man's hand. Black blisters were sign something was very wrong.,"CLOSE Learn the signs and treatment of the rare disease ""necrotizing fasciitis."" USA TODAY

A Florida man said he is lucky to be alive after a minor prick from a fishing hook led to a life-threatening, flesh-eating bacterial infection.

Fisherman Mike Walton caught his hand in a fishing hook in the Gulf of Mexico days ago, and didn't think much of it, he told Tampa Bay's WFTS. It's an injury he said he's had hundreds of times while fishing.

But, his hand began to swell — with large black blisters. Usual antibiotics weren't working. So, Walton drove himself to an emergency room, where doctors told him he needed surgery or he might lose his arm or worse.

“They said in a few hours, this would have gone up my arm into my chest and I wouldn’t have been here. There was no saving me,” Walton told Florida's FOX 13.

Doctors considered amputating his arm, but were able to remove the bacteria from skin tissue between his elbow and the palm of his hand, he said.

""I got real lucky on this one,"" he told WFTS.

The flesh-eating infection, necrotizing fasciitis, is rare and can be deadly. Bacteria that causes it can enter the body through even small breaks in the skin and spreads quickly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Walton, who works in construction, said this injury won't stop him from fishing in the future.

""I want to go right now,"" he said. ""It ain't going to slow me down. It's one thing I enjoy.""

Doctors told Walton the infection is contained, he said, but he'll likely need to be on antibiotics for another month, and require additional weeks to heal.

601,Mayfaire by-the-Lake art fest draws thousands,"LAKELAND — Alexis Rayelle has driven from Tampa every year for about the past six years for one thing: to shop at the annual Mayfaire by-the-Lake art festival, a juried show that features $17,000 in cash prizes.

""I love all the artists,"" said Rayelle, sporting a colorful lace scarf and straw hat with a red ribbon.

She also loves to have conversations with the artists. ""The artists are so friendly,"" she said.

Rayelle said she likes to create things as well, and does a lot of sewing.

""I bought a scarf from Foxxy Chic six or seven years ago, and I plan to look for another one,"" she said.

The banks of Lake Morton draw thousands for the two-day, Mother's Day weekend show with some 165 artists, including 46 who were new to Mayfaire by-the-Lake.

Gillian Fazio, who grew up in Lakeland, attending Rochelle School of the Arts, Lois Cowles Harrison Center for the Visual and Performing Arts, and Lakeland High School, she eventually made her way to the University of Florida.

This was Fazio's first year displaying her art at the show, she said, and she admits she was a little nervous.

""I didn't have pro-panels to display my art,"" she said, noting she took a six-hour drive Thursday night to pick up her panels.

While at UF, she said, she had always dabbled in art, drawing, and painting, but as a college student, she said, ""I can do this,"" and went for a bachelor's degree in fine art.

She works at Painting with A Twist, and does art on the side. Classifying herself as a ""studio artist and muralist,"" she said she took part in Lakeland's Tapestries program recently.

Then there is Andre La Salle of New Orleans, Louisiana, who said this is only his fourth show ""on the road.""

His metal works of art could be thought of as simiiar to Steampunk, but he describes his art as more like taking ""modern"" pieces of the world we live in"" to create his works.

Skulls, butterflies, gears, and other symbols are part of his art. He said he prefers to sell art face to face.

A serious artist, he said he considers his works his children, and said he likes to know where they are going.

Can he tell a serious buyer from an onlooker?

""I can read people's body language,"" he said. ""and their relationship to my work. They may love it, but it has no place for them.""

But there are others who immediately connect with a piece. ""Their eyes lock on a piece and they are unable to separate themselves from it,"" he said.

Art buyers were out in number Saturday, as many carried a canvas, or a sculpture. One man carried his large and quite heavy metal spider he just purchased, with a smile on his face and no time to talk.

Not every artist was a newcomer to Mayfaire-by-the-Lake. Lorrie Mason, a metal crafter of gold, silver, and copper, has been to Mayfaire numerous times, and said she used to be a vocational rehabilitation counselor. She also has a degree in psychology, but she left all that to become a stay-at-home mom. It was then she took her hobby to a new level for income, she said.

Mason said she is the kind of person who sees trash on the side of the road and wants to rescue it and fix it. Her findings, and things her friends give her like old skeleton keys, became the media for her work.

""I am astounded to call myself a jeweler and an artist,"" she said. Three years ago, she opened her boutique, ""On the Fringe,"" in Tampa to sell her jewelry, ""groovy clothing,"" and local products.

Andrew Clever, a youth worker with Lake Morton Community Church, was busy providing free parking and bottled water to the community, and said the event is always well attended. The church sought to be a help, as many either would avoid parking in the church's lot because they did not know they could, or they would park here and there, and it would be a mess. Clever said the church had assigned someone to help people park.

A family- and pet-friendly event, dogs here and there could be seen munching on ice cubes provided by their owners.

A 3-year-old yellow lab named ""Chuck"" wore a royal blue scarf that said ""Don't just stand there, pet me,"" and toured the show with his owner, Cynthia Grimes of Lakeland. ""Almost every weekend, I take him to an event,"" she said. Chuck made his way to other well behaved art show dogs, on leashes beside their owners, as Grimes chatted with various people she met and children who wanted to give Chuck a hug. ""He loves the attention,"" she said.

With temperatures in the low 90s, one person said the show is often called the ""bake by the lake"" by some artists because of the heat. But organizers of the show did much to cool things down with numerous ""Power Breezers"" that misted cool air and water for anyone who wanted to stand in front of them. The line at one Breezer increased as the noon hour approached, as some made their way to various tents and chairs with cold drinks and food they purchased from vendors. Proceeds from the sale of the food and beverages help support the programs of the Polk Museum of Art at Florida Southern College. Shade trees along some of the sidewalks beside Lake Morton provided comfort and scenery as well.

Shuttle service was provided free from Florida Southern College.

The event, presented by Polk Musuem of Art, was sponsored by Citizens Bank & Trust. For more information on Mayfaire-by-the-Lake, visit www.mayfairebythelake.org. Mayfaire-by-the-Lake will run on Sunday as well, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

602,Man claims Deltona wastewater plant noise keeps him from sleeping,"DELTONA —Keith Lawhun envisioned a quiet, semi-rural lifestyle when he purchased several acres of property near the city's border with unincorporated Osteen in 2007.

He had dreams of developing a residential community for people with physical disabilities. Lawhun hasn't had use of his arms since he was in his early 20s. He had Hodgkin's disease at 13, and the amount of radiation he received caused significant damage. While he didn't let it slow him down, he's seen how disabilities can make the people who have them feel out of place.

But Lawhun's idyllic plans have not developed. Shortly after he moved onto his property on Keelhaul Road, the city of Deltona purchased 52 acres of land next door, the future site of a wastewater treatment plant.

The wastewater plant went into operation in the spring of 2016. Lawhun claims it's so noisy it interferes with his sleep. And when the wind blows the wrong way, the stench is unavoidable.

""I'm supposed to be able to enjoy the outdoors and indoors of life here after they built the plant as I did before,"" Lawhun said while standing in his yard on a recent night, the wastewater plant humming loudly in the background. ""The crickets that you hear? That's what I should be hearing.""

The 60-year-old unsuccessfully sued the city in 2017 — the third legal action he's taken against Deltona related to the property. Lawhun's attorneys, George Trovato and Tanner Andrews, are working on an appeal, which they expect to file this month, court records show. Lawhun and his lawyers assert the city is violating its own noise ordinance with the plant, as well as the Florida Administrative Code's chapter on domestic wastewater facilities.

But Lawhun has nearly given up on finding the peace and quiet that once existed when he traveled down Keelhaul Road — a pine tree- and palmetto-lined dirt road where lightning bugs make appearances. He his wife, Emma, hope to find eventual solitude on a rural property they purchased in Kentucky.

With years gone by and about $30,000 he estimates he's spent fighting the city, Lawhun hopes to win his appeal, sell his property, write a book, and move to a place where development is harder to find.

Sound expectations

Lawhun's property is zoned agricultural, but it's also where he and his wife live. According to Deltona's city code, ""all premises containing habitually occupied sleeping quarters shall be considered residential use.""

The couple's bedroom is on the end of the house closest to the wastewater plant. Before going to bed, they turn on the exhaust fan in their nearby bathroom in an effort to drown out the plant's sharp humming.

Deltona spokesman Lee Lopez said city officials wouldn't comment for this story, citing the ongoing litigation.

But according to Deltona ordinances, sound level limits for residential property are set at 60 decibels from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. and 55 decibels from 10:01 p.m. to 6:59 a.m. That's about the sound level of a normal conversation from 3 feet away, according to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Agency.

In contrast, the wastewater plant resides on a parcel that also is zoned agricultural. There, the city sound limit can be 75 decibels at all times. That's somewhere between classroom chatter and a freight train at 100 feet, according to OSHA.

Lawhun hired sound expert Dave Parzych as part of his most recent legal effort. According to Parzych, noise from the plant often exceeds 55 decibels on Lawhun's property, and levels inside of the couple's bedroom are typically 40-plus decibels. That's about the sound of a soft whisper from 5 feet away, according to OSHA.

Parzych, founder, president and principal acoustic consultant of Power Acoustics, Inc., monitored Lawhun's property for 24 hours on June 5, 2018. Lawhun left the property for that period so as to not contribute to any sound readings.

""What we found was the sound exceeded the city of Deltona noise ordinance for residential properties relatively frequently, and inside his home the sound was well exceeding what would typically be thought of as an annoying sound by the World Health Organization,"" said Parzych, who has testified in several dozen cases related to sound.

Levels in a bedroom should be less than 30 decibels for a person to get good quality sleep, according to the World Health Organization.

During one of a reporter's visits, noise on Lawhun's property standing outside at 9 p.m. from the wastewater plant ranged from 56 to 62 decibels, according to Lawhun's digital sound meter.

Human perception of sound is such that every time there's an increase of 10 decibels, the noise seems twice as loud, Parzych said.

In Lawhun's lawsuit, he requested the city operate the wastewater plant in a manner that would not produce noise greater than 55 decibels at any time; that it not emit sounds from motors, generators and alarms between the hours of 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.; that it not make noise louder than the average volume of conversation at the property boundary; and that it not emit sound that violates the Florida Administrative Code.

The Florida Administrative Code's chapter on domestic wastewater facilities was included in the permit the city received from the state Department of Environmental Protection. In part, it states, ""new treatment plants and modifications to existing plants shall be designed and located on the site so as to minimize adverse effects resulting from odors, noise, aerosol drift and lighting."" Also, treatment plants ""shall not cause odor, noise, aerosol drift or lighting in such amounts or at such levels that they adversely affect neighboring residents, in commercial or residential areas, so as to be potentially harmful or injurious to human health or welfare or unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or property.""

In October 2016, the Department of Environmental Protection noted in an inspection report summary that Deltona's wastewater plant had a minor out-of-compliance issue because of a ""rising intermittent cycling noise"" that could be deemed offensive.

In February 2017, Matt Doan, the city's public works director at the time, emailed an environmental specialist with the Department of Environmental Protection about the various efforts the city made to reduce or manage noise at the wastewater plant after it was designed. Those efforts included rotating the generator 180 degrees so the exhaust would face away from Lawhun's home, changing the generator exercise start time and changing how often the air release valve blows.

Lawhun and his attorneys contend those efforts didn't improve things.

Parzych also said that while the wastewater treatment plant doesn't exceed the city's sound limits every second of the day, it does exceed them some of the time, and even when it's not louder than the limits, often it's barely under them.

""The problem that I see with this is that noise ordinances are put in place to be protective of the people, and what they (the city of Deltona) have done is interpret the ordinance to be protective of the noise maker,"" Parzych said.

B. Scott George, an attorney with Fowler, O'Quinn, Feeney and Sneed, P.A., the Orlando-based law firm representing the city, argued in a January 2019 memorandum that Lawhun's claims ""are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.""

Res judicata, according to Cornell Law School, is ""a matter that has been adjudicated by a competent court and may not be pursued further by the same parties.""

Lawhun's attorney Tanner Andrews said the city is arguing that Lawhun should've raised his noise issue with the wastewater plant in an earlier lawsuit he filed in January 2016 against Deltona regarding access to an easement that connects both the plant and Lawhun's property to 11th Avenue, which in turn connects with State Road 415. The issue with that argument, Andrews said, is the plant wasn't fully operating at that time, so Lawhun had no idea the level of noise that wastewater plant would emit at that time.

The final judgment in the 2016 easement case, which was filed in November 2018, was that the city couldn't block Lawhun's access to 11th Avenue at any time, court records show.

George also argues in the memorandum defending the city that the wastewater plant's noise is reasonable under common law nuisance doctrine, and Lawhun hasn't properly pleaded his case for relief or proved that it's necessary the court issue a permanent mandatory injunction against the city. Additionally, George argued that the court hearing the case was lacking in subject matter jurisdiction regarding the Florida Administrative Code's chapter on domestic wastewater facilities.

But Andrews said the plant's noise is a textbook example of a nuisance.

""It's hard to live in a house where there's so much racket you can't sleep,"" Andrews said. ""The zoning doesn't change the fact that it's producing way too much noise and thereby interfering with Mr. Lawhun's use of his property.""

In February, Volusia County Court Judge Christopher Kelly denied one of the three counts in the lawsuit and granted the city's motion for involuntary dismissal of the other two. Kelly said he wasn't sure res judicata applied in the nuisance case and was basing his ruling on Lawhun carrying the burden of persuasion, which Kelly didn't feel was met, according to court transcripts.

""I have no doubts whatsoever that Mr. Lawhun's use of the property has been disturbed by the building of the water treatment plant there,"" Kelly said, according to court transcripts. ""The question is, does it rise to the level of inducements and such that the law would support this court issuing a mandatory injunction directing the city to take certain steps?""

He said, they said

Lawhun said he knew when he purchased his property in April 2007 that the city was considering purchasing an adjacent parcel for a wastewater plant. He also said the city told him if the plant was constructed, it would be some distance from Lawhun's property, with plenty of trees in between.

While the agricultural zoning of the city's property allows for water treatment plants, the structure should ""in the absence of an appropriate natural vegetation screen, be visually screened from adjoining properties ... with an appropriate fence, decorative masonry or plant material,"" according to Detona's city code.

The small amount of vegetation the city planted between the wastewater plant and Lawhun's property does nothing to mitigate the treatment plant's noise, Parzych said.

""You have to have several hundred feet of trees that are mature, dense trees before you get any substantial noise reduction from buffering and vegetation,"" Parzych testified, according to court transcripts.

Parzych said the layout of the treatment facility was ""poorly designed,"" and ""there's things that could've been done to mitigate the noise."" But ""any time you put in mitigation, there's a cost associated with it.""

George, the city's attorney in the case, said if the city made efforts to lessen the sound just so Lawhun can enjoy his property, it could potentially open the city up to regulatory issues, court records show.

Trovato, who previously worked for the city, said the frequency of the sound has increased with the elevated usage of the plant.

""Nobody really cares at this point about what's going on,"" Trovato said. ""And since it's only one neighbor out in the woods, it's like 'maybe he'll just get tired and go away.'""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190511/man-claims-deltona-wastewater-plant-noise-keeps-him-from-sleeping?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T11:11:35Z,Daytona Beach News,Florida Man,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

In surveillance video released by the sheriff's office, the man can be heard yelling at the woman to return his property, however, it's not clear to what property he is referring.

""Give me my [explitive!] Give me my [explitive]!"" the man yells at the woman after smashing the block into her vehicle.

The video, recorded Thursday, May 8, shows a tan vehicle parked sideways on San Miguel Drive in Port Richey, Florida. A black car is parked on the roadway in front of the tan car. The man, standing with his hand on the side of the tan vehicle, appears to yell at the person driving the black vehicle.

""Back up! Back up! Back up!"" he yells.

612,Man arrested for shooting girlfriend in back in Dade City,"DADE CITY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Hernando County man is facing several charges after deputies say he shot his girlfriend in the back and claimed it was an accident.

Hernando County deputies say a 911 hang-up call came in just after 6 a.m. Wednesday. When operators called the number back, 40-year-old Ronald Crisp answered.

Deputies say Crisp told 911 operators he was cleaning his gun when he accidentally shot his girlfriend. Operators say they heard a woman scream in the background and the call disconnected. Operators attempted to get back in touch with Crisp several times. When he finally answered, operators say a woman was heard screaming in the background asking for the phone. The call was then disconnected again.

Hernando County deputies who responded to the home on Reynolds Street in Dade City say they found a woman bleeding from her lower back. The woman was treated at the scene and was then taken to a local trauma center for advanced care.

When detectives spoke with Crisp at the scene, they say the man claimed he was ""clearing"" his gun when it accidentally went off, sending a round through the wall into the living room area. Crisp told them he then heard the woman screaming that she had been shot.

Once the victim was out of surgery, she spoke with detectives and told them the shooting was not accidental. Deputies say the woman told them she and Crisp had been arguing for a few days. According to a report from the sheriff's office, the woman said Crisp had a pocketknife in his hands during the argument.

The woman claims, at some point, Crisp got a handgun. She told deputies she exchanged words with Crisp and walked out of the bedroom, closing the door behind her.

Detectives say the woman told them she ""immediately heard a shot, then felt pain in her lower back."" When she screamed for Crisp to call 911, the victim told deputies he hesitated and then told her to go get his gun cleaning kit.

During a search of the home, detectives say they found a .380 caliber handgun with an altered serial number, a hidden short-barreled rifle with no identifiable serial number and a pocketknife. Deputies noted there was no hole in the wall where Crisp claimed there would be. A bullet hole was found in the bedroom door, deputies say.

Crisp was arrested and charged with aggravated battery with a firearm, shooting a deadly missile, tampering with a witness, possession of a firearm with an altered serial number and possession of a short-barreled rifle.

616,"Weston man sentenced to 5 ½ years in prison for bank robberies, attempted carjacking","The FBI says David L. Brasher robbed a Bank of America in Fort Lauderdale.

BROWARD COUNTY, Fla. - A Weston man was sentenced Wednesday to 5 ½ years in federal prison for two bank robberies and an attempted carjacking.

David Brasher, 36, pleaded guilty on Feb. 22 to two counts of bank robbery and one count of attempted carjacking.

U.S. District Judge William P. Dimitrouleas sentenced Brasher to a total of 66 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release. Dimitrouleas also ordered Brasher to pay a total of $18,826 in restitution.

According to prosecutors, Brasher robbed a teller at a Wells Fargo Bank in Sunrise on Oct. 30, 2018.

Prosecutors said he handed the teller a note demanding cash and stating that he had a bomb.

He also raised his shirt and displayed what the teller thought was a handgun, prosecutors said.

According to court record, Brasher fled the bank with $18,613.

Prosecutors said he robbed a Bank of American in Fort Lauderdale on Nov. 6 and once again handed a teller a note demanding cash and warning that he had a bomb.

Prosecutors said he got away with $2,815 during that robbery.

Brasher was also convicted of trying to carjack a woman and her daughter in a parking lot in Fort Lauderdale hours after the robbery at the Bank of America.

Prosecutors said he threatened her with a beer bottle and told her he would kill her if she didn't hand over her keys.

The woman screamed for help and her husband, who was a short distance away, ran over and punched Brasher in the head.

Brasher then ran away, authorities said.

617,Registered sex offender accused of publicly masturbating at UCF's campus,"Malik Gaither seen in a surveillance photo and in a mug shot, according to UCF police.

ORLANDO, Fla. - A registered sex offender is accused of publicly masturbating in front of students at the University of Central Florida on Tuesday, according to authorities.

The UCF Police Department said a woman reported that she was getting into her car, which was parked in a lot near Garage I, when she noticed a man, later identified as Malik Gaither, touching himself inappropriately while looking in her direction.

Police said they searched the campus and noticed a man who matched the description provided by the witness. Gaither, 25, abandoned a backpack and began walking faster when he noticed an officer approaching him, according to the report.

While investigating, police said they found surveillance video that showed Gaither masturbating near a woman who was on the phone and appeared to be unaware outside Trevor Colbourn Hall.

The backpack in Gaither's possession had been reported stolen by a student, according to the affidavit. It contained a laptop, headphones, $300 cash and a plane ticket with the victim's name on it, authorities said.

Police said Gaither has no ties to the university. He was trespassed from campus and arrested on charges of exposure of sexual organs, grand theft and loitering/prowling.

Records from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement show Gaither was adjudicated on a sexual battery charge in 2007, when he was a juvenile.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - A South Florida man on business in the Tampa Bay area claims he was harassed by Starbucks employees at the company's Brandon store.



Lorne Green says he's been to that location before, usually with his white colleague, and never had any problems.



At a news conference on Wednesday, Green explained that his trip to the Starbucks at 2350 W. Brandon Blvd. went horribly wrong on April 22.



Green claims he walked in to use the bathroom before placing his order, and heard an employee say ""the big black guy is headed for the bathroom.""



As Green used the restroom, he told reporters that employees kept banging on the door asking if he needed fire and rescue.



Green called Starbucks corporate to explain what was happening, and he recorded that phone call, playing part of it for reporters Wednesday afternoon.



He said he began to fear for his life when employees said they were calling the police.



""I felt humiliated,"" Green said. ""Completely defeated. They had wronged me, and now they were going to call the cops on me?""



Hillsborough County deputies arrived and issued him a citation for trespassing, according to Green's attorney, civil rights lawyer Jasmine Rand.



He was told not to return or he would be arrested.

620,"Navarre man and his blind dog complete 1,100-mile hike of Florida Trail","While Kyle Rohrig’s little canine hiking companion, Katana, recently lost her eyesight, she has kept her spirit of adventure.

The Navarre resident’s pooch is a Shiba Inu, a Japanese breed of hunting dog. Glaucoma caused her to lose one of her eyes at age 5 and her other eye shortly after she turned 8 late last year.

In earlier years Katana had joined her owner for long-distance treks on paths such as the Appalachian Trail, where she was able to walk more than 30 miles per day on her own.

Her total blindness came about two months before Rohrig’s planned hike on the Florida National Scenic Trail, which stretches more than 1,100 miles between Big Cypress National Preserve near Miami and Fort Pickens near Pensacola.

“On this hike, with her recently becoming completely blind, I was really nervous about how she would do,” said Rohrig, who is 29. “I was worried she would be miserable and I would be miserable, but she rose to the occasion and did a lot better than I thought she would.

""She was happy playing on the trail and she would take the lead sometimes. I don’t know how, but she would stay down the center of the trail. It was really emotional for me to see how well she did in her current circumstances.”

When the pair approached deep swampy areas and other places in poor condition, or when they faced dozens of miles of walking on roads around hurricane-damaged areas, Rohrig would hoist the 21-pound Katana onto his backpack.

He estimates he carried her for more than 800 miles of their journey.

The pair initially headed north on the trail from Big Cypress on Dec. 30. After more than 50 miles of hiking, they returned to the trailhead because a friend of Rohrig’s wanted to join him and hike the entire trail.

The trio departed on Jan. 8 and finished April 1.

Dealing with insects and not being able to cool down at night were tough, but the 30 miles of hiking in Big Cypress were the hardest part of the journey, Rohrig said.

“The mud and water were just ridiculous,” he said. “And during my first time there, it was around 80 or 90 degrees. They were having a heat wave.”

A few days after Rohrig and his hiking buddies finished their trek near Pensacola, hunters posted a photo and breaking news online of the largest female Burmese python ever captured in Big Cypress.

Rohrig said he didn’t see any pythons in South Florida, but he did see “tons” of other kinds of snakes, as well as hundreds of alligators.

The snakes he spotted included coral snakes, pygmy rattlers, corn snakes, coachwhips and an Eastern diamondback rattlesnake. None of the critters acted aggressively, Rohrig said.

He plans to hike Vermont’s 272-mile Long Trail in May and start hiking the 3,100-mile Continental Divide Trail between Canada and Mexico in June. Rohrig said Katana might join him on the Long Trail.

Rohrig has written several books, including “Lost on the Appalachian Trail,” about his various hiking adventures. He hiked the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail between Canada and Mexico three years ago.

“I write and I hike and I fish,” he said. “I’m living the dream.”",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190427/navarre-man-and-his-blind-dog-complete-1100-mile-hike-of-florida-trail?rssfeed=true,2019-04-27T19:52:50Z,Daytona Beach News,Florida Man,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
623,South Florida man waits 2 years to receive title for purchased motorcycle,"<p>A South Florida man got the motor running on his new motorcycle and was all set to head out on the highway, but there's one big problem.</p>

<p>Ruben Mendez recently purchased a Honda Magna V-30 motorcycle that has just 14,000 miles on it.</p>

<p>""I've changed all the hoses on it, gave her a tune up, put a fairing, some extra spot lights and a couple of trunks in there,"" he said. ""All I need right now is some tires and a tag to get her on the road, and she's ready to go."" </p>

<p>Mendez told Local 10's Leave it to Layron team that he spotted the motorcycle at a neighbor's house and that neighbor eventually agreed to sell it to him.</p>

<p>Mendez said he began making monthly $50 payments on the motorcycle on Jan. 14, 2017, until the bike was paid for to the sum of $1,000, which was agreed upon by him and the seller.</p>

<p>""Every time I paid, I signed. He received, he signed,"" Mendez said. </p>

<p>Mendez took possession of the bike and said the seller moved out of the neighborhood, although he would still come by to receive payments.</p>

<p>Mendez said he took a motorcycle endorsement class and kept making his payments until last September when the final payment was due. </p>

<p>""My payment, my title, goodbye and we're done,"" he said. </p>

<p>But when it was time to hand over the title, Mendez said the seller ghosted him.</p>

<p>""No call, no show. The last address I went to, he doesn't live there,"" Mendez said. ""No emails, no voicemails, no texts -- no anything.""</p>

<p>Mendez said he has gone to numerous places to find out how he can aquire a tag for the motorcycle but has turned up empty-handed.</p>

<p>""Nobody could give me answers,"" he said. ""In fact, I went to a tag agency on Sheridan Street, and I explained to the man what was going on with me, and he just looked at me boldly and said, 'Well, I guess you have a bike you can't ride.' So that's when I got fed up and said, 'I got to make a phone call,' and you're the phone call.""</p>

<p>It's a good thing Mendez did keep his detailed ledger and contract.</p>

<p>The LITL team contacted the county tax collector's office, which said the ledger, the receipts, the signatures, the title and VIN could all be presented to a clerk of court.</p>

<p>A court order could then be issued, granting Mendez ownership of the bike. All he'd have to do from there is present that order to the DMV to get his title and tags.</p>

<p>""(I) just want to ride the bike, pop wheelies, cause all kinds of Hades and be free like a bird,"" Mendez said. ""That's all I want to do, is just ride.""</p>

Sometimes you have to wait for what you really want. You may not have told everyone about your dream. You might have been hesitant to reveal the depth of your fantasy. But if you’re ready when the magical opportunity comes — you’ll jump at the chance and your dreams can come true.

Especially if you want to be a mermaid.

A mermaid? OK. An unusual obsession perhaps, but where is it written that a 67-year-old grandmother, wife of a prominent retired physician, a garden designer, former beekeeper and environmentalist can’t also have fantasized about living the good life under the waves, wriggling her tail in graceful arcs and fraternizing with benevolent turtles and fish?

For one Tallahassee woman who has actually worn the flippers — nowhere is it written!

Jo Ostrov sits on the edge of a hot tub beneath a garden gazebo. Above her is a sign indicating we have entered an outdoor sanctum she calls her Mermaid Lagoon. Though not a watery lagoon per se, it is where Ostrov repairs to soak up the ambiance she has created in the little garden grotto.

Surrounded with table-sized clam shells, and smaller exotic shells from the Phillippines, Hawaii, Costa Rica, and Japan, Ostrov has adorned herself with colorful, exotic mollusk jewelry at her wrists, neck and ears. Mermaid statuary is nearby and the entire “lagoon” palette is touched with aqua… including the color of Ostrov’s nails. “I am a “water person,” she says matter-of-factly. “My husband is a land-man, but he respects my need to be near and in the water every day.”

And she means it. Ostrov swims at Premier Health and Fitness pool four or five times a week. Her five garden venues include small ponds, bubbling fountains, and winding streams. And she is never happier than when on the yearly vacations the couple has made to Hawaii since the '80s, Ostrov finds herself swimming in the clear, warm waters of Kauai.

Other favorite venues to interact with dolphins, turtles, and commune with whales, will find her snorkeling, scuba-diving, or body surfing beside youths a third her age. Jo Ostrov was most definitely cut out to be a mermaid. Yet it might not have been so.

“I was born in Akron,” she says. “One of nine children, we didn’t go to fancy country clubs to learn to swim, but rather to one of Ohio’s muddy lakes where a Red Cross instructor would oversee our progress. My mother, sitting on the sand, never really learned.”

In high school, Ostrov was in the school pool every day of summer, later becoming a life guard at Ohio State. She added swimming with the synchronized team and got her scuba certification before heading off for her initial experience with the “real ocean,” her first visit to Hawaii. The underwater beauty of corals and animal life, the colors, the currents touched something in Ostrov that she has yet to still. Nor would she want to.

Fast forward nearly 50 years. Along with other trends like Princesses, Unicorns and Pet Rocks, Mermaids began to have their day. Everyone from little girls, to big girls and their mothers seemed to have awakened to Ariel and the allure of the deep. Mermaid toys, blankets, jewelry, even pet outfits came to market.

Even more unusual, adult women could pop for $300 “seamless, neoprene/Silicone, swimmable tails.” And three and half hours south of Tallahassee, though marginally operational, there existed a venerable Florida attraction that for all the ways time had passed it by, knew that at least it had something the public could still get excited about. Weeki Wachee Springs State Park had Mermaids!

In 1947, Newt Perry had built the roadside “pull-‘um’in” in the crystal clear waters of Weeki Watchee Springs. Within its craggy underwater geography, he contrived a giant shoot called the “Tunnel” through which 35 mostly local girls would drop themselves into the water and emerge from under a stony shelf to frolic and wave at visitors behind giant plate glass windows, awing Midwestern holiday crowds at seeing “real mermaids” cavorting in the deep. And then Disney Inc. brought the whole operation to a near sputtering stop.

Yet despite the competition to the south and the mermaid vogue’s slow wane, Weeki Wachee has carried on — and parlayed a certain nostalgia into good business. Today Junior Mermaid camps and Sirens of the Deep camps, for those over 30, are $450 Sold Out affairs. From April to October, two-day “camps” are organized by former Weeki Wachee mermaids who mentor and coach those whose fantasies might have only grown over the years. Jo Ostrov, one of eight in each class, says the oldest woman in her camp group was 80.

“It was wonderful,” enthuses Ostrov. “I had practiced my dolphin kicks in the pool for a month before I went so my stomach muscles were ready! The hardest part really, was getting into the mermaid tail and hopping backwards on the deck to get into the water.” But once in, she says she found her joy. With clear spring water rushing from beneath the earth from a vent the size of a car, the water is 72 degrees.

“It feels wonderful when you first enter, but for every 45 minutes you spend in the water, you loose three degrees of body temperature,” said Ostrov. The amateur mermaids, all in their confining tails, spent four such sessions in the water each day practicing their “underwater pinwheels, backward dolphins, and flower swimming.”

Ostrov says that though campers don’t learn to use the long oxygen tubes reserved for the professional mermaids who are putting on shows right beside the campers, they did master keeping their eyes open for long periods, wearing a constant beatific smile, and slowly letting air out of their mouths so as not to pop to the surface in an unmermaid-like eruption.

“It was so definitely a delight,” says Jo Ostrov, who in the future yearns to take a granddaughter or two back to Weeki Watchee to wiggle into a tail. “Swimming with the ancient white flounders that live at the bottom of the springs, being shadowed by the huge turtles who seem to love to spend time with the “mermaids” was wonderful.”

And for Jo Ostrov, committed water person, it seems a basic bucket-list item has been checked off. One can perhaps even hear her humming the signature song of the mermaids of Weeki Wachee, a tongue-in-cheek, but very heart-felt, “I’ve Got the World by the Tail… sittin’ on a rainbow…” And in her case, it would very definitely be true.

Duck decorum

The News-Press has published stories concerning the Muscovy duck and its designation as an “invasive pest”. The stories don't mention that these ducks are very gentle, trusting, and intelligent animals.

The Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission decided in 2010, that these ducks are a non-native, invasive species ignoring evidence that they have been in the area for hundreds of years. They eat bugs, plants, roaches, mosquitoes, all kind of creatures we really don't want. Their main offense is they are messy.

If we, as a society, start killing living things because they are messy, we are in trouble. The News-Press article gave the idea that it is acceptable to kill these gentle ducks with pellet guns. The ducks scare easily by yelling at the or using a water gun.

In a day where in our society mass murders seem to be frequent, maybe the idea that shooting these ducks is way off base. A culture can be judged by how it treats living animals. If you don't want them around, don't feed them, spray them with water to scare them, and yell at them. They are pretty smart and will get the idea quickly that you don't want them around.

Missed opportunity

My wife and I just came back from our first Lee-Collier County Honor Flight. I was a guardian for a five-tour Vietnam veteran. Spent the day in Washington, D.C., at all the memorials then came home to RSW to a true heroes welcome.

Between two thousand and three thousand men, women, children, infants, including other veterans in uniform greeted them with cheering, hugging and kissing our veterans, giving them candy and home made letters from the kids.



Finally, they were properly thanked for their sacrifice for all of us. The only thing missing was the media. No TV cameras etc. Is it only death and blood and guts violence that sells?



Missed opportunity for our community to share a very special moment.

Make priority

In politics, as in life, priorities matter. The 2017 tax law, which heavily favored large corporations and the wealthy, is a perfect example of putting the wrong things first.

But the new Working Families Tax Relief Act does it right. It would significantly boost income for working families by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, and give families an additional tax credit for raising young children. That's more money for basic necessities, home repairs, maintaining a car to get to work, and in some cases, education to get a higher-paying job. This bill would benefit 44 million families and lift 11 million children above the poverty line.

Priorities matter. It's time we fixed our tax laws to give working people and children a fair shot to get ahead. Congress should make expanding the EITC and CTC a priority in any upcoming tax legislation.

Truth test

We are a politically divided electorate, but one thing we ought to agree on is that the President of the United States should not be a serial liar. Yes, presidents lie; there are abundant examples, but Trump’s predecessors lied selectively, lied to cover up personal indiscretions or bad policy; they didn’t lie frequently and gratuitously.

When Eisenhower lied about U-2 flights over Russia, he lied to prevent covert CIA missions from becoming public. When Lyndon Johnson lied about military operations in the Gulf of Tonkin, he was trying to advance his war agenda in Vietnam. When Bill Clinton lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, he was trying to save his family and himself from embarrassment.

The Washington Post reports that, as president, Trump has told over 10,000 lies, averaging about two dozen a day. Unlike his predecessors, Trump latches onto conspiracy theories and lunatic fringe nonsense and presents the ideas to the American people as truth. Among his many lies at the Saturday rally in Wisconsin, Trump offered the vile assertion that Democrats support infanticide.

Maybe the difference between Trump and other presidents is that they knew they were lying; Trump, on the other hand, probably believes the falsehoods he spews. But is this the person we want as president, someone who doesn't know the difference between a lie and the truth, and doesn't care?

There's hope

Regarding the News from the North item from Virginia in The News-Press on April 29:

Let's get this straight. A former presidential statue park went belly up. So an individual moved them to a private park where there is a small fee for visitation. A visitor walked off with a bust of Obama. Why?

When word got out that the bust had been stolen an individual came forward and said he had it. The thief wanted to return it. He was praised for his honesty (wow).

Quote: There is hope for people in this country. It is amazing that the thief actually returned the object.

Amen.

Facts first

I have been thinking about this for the past few weeks. Several people have written to the Mailbag with opinions of what is and is not stated in the Muller report. In most cases views expressed were repeats of the political rhetoric from one side or the other.

When Muller was appointed both sides of the aisle proclaimed he was the right person for this assignment.

Before anyone offers their opinions of what is in the report or what if any followup action should be taken or not taken – I urge them to actually spend the time to read it. It is available on line and although dry reading it details what was investigated, what criteria was used to determine the impact of actions, what the impacts were. It is well written and detailed.

We should all be basing our opinions on facts and not just repeating others views. Spend the time to do your own investigation before trying to influence others and support your view with data not rhetoric of others.

By the way, I just finished reading all 448 pages.

Very unfair

Am I the only one who finds it jarring when a grown man uses the expression very unfair? That expression is something a 5-year-old uses when his sister got a bigger slice of cake. It sounds odd every time it is used by a candidate, let alone officeholders in our country.



It’s very unfair that hundreds of thousands of us survivors are repeatedly re-victimized every time we hear his voice after having heard him brag about how women “let him” sexually assault them. No, that’s not very unfair, it’s heartbreaking.



It’s very unfair that thousands of parents, siblings, children and others cry themselves to sleep every night because their loved ones were murdered on this presidents’ watch. No, that’s not very unfair, it’s contemptible. Its very unfair that people who come to America seeking sanctuary from violence are incarcerated, likely split from their family, and sleeping tonight on cold concrete with a foil blanket. No that’s not “very unfair.”. That’s despicable.



I have some news for you, Mr. President, and I am kind of surprised that you don’t already know this. Life is unfair. And America is not 5 years old.



Jennifer Smith, Fort Myers

Ominous threat

A recent letter offered assurances about the continued existence of the Electoral College. I share the writer’s support for the electoral process, but have some concerns.

The mostly Democrat opposition to the electoral process is making progress. The most prominent movement is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC). This initiative intends to guarantee the candidate winning the national popular vote is elected. NPVIC must get states to enact legislation whereby states pledge all their electors to the national popular vote winner. They need to sign on enough states to theoretically control 270 (50% plus one) of the 538 electors. They have 189 electors so far from approval by a mere 14 states. That’s threatening progress.

The Constitution seems to prohibit interstate agreements such as NPVIC unless Congress consents, but legal scholars aren’t in agreement about that. In order to eliminate the Electoral College by Constitutional Amendment, it would require three-fourths of the states, or 38. So NPVIC does seem easier.

Destruction of the Electoral College isn’t likely, but it does face an ominous threat. We must resist these efforts in order to preserve this “linchpin” of our “representative republic” form of government.

Drug dilemma

We understand that a large percentage of generic drugs are manufactured in Turkey and India. Are these prescription drugs going to be outlawed if this imported drug bill is passed?

My wife takes three different inhalers for her COPD. Even with insurance they are too expensive for us to buy in the U.S. However, we can get (namebrand inhalers) through mail order that originate in the UK, but are probably manufactured elsewhere, at almost half the price of the same brand in the U.S.

Is this new bill going to take these opportunities away from us? I would bet that it is the big pharmaceuticals that are promoting this movement.

Taxpayer folly

As I write these words, the Florida State budget is now on its way to the governor’s desk for signature. Inevitably, the crowing about “who-got-what” will start to pop up on editorial pages all across Florida. Politicians will brag to their constituents about how they brought home the bacon. Lobbyists will be hugged by their employers.

And the taxpayers will foot the bill.

This is as good a time as any to remember that the State budget is NOT a giant pinata, with goodies cascading down on the participants as the prodding ends. It is supposed to do the absolute necessary, and nothing more.

We have strayed badly from our original founding principles of limited government, individual initiative, and personal responsibility.

Next time, vote Libertarian. Thank you.

Good example

Thank you for the excellent article today about teen mental health and the mental health system. The article highlighted the scandalous and dangerous lack of mental health providers, facilities and resources in this area. We must be advocates for people that cannot advocate for themselves.

I would hope that readers would start demanding that our political leaders address funding for resources and treatment, and improve access to mental health professionals. Journalists are a pillar in maintaining our democracy, and this article was a good example of education and advocacy that we sorely need.

Linda Sebastian, fort Myers

Undermining future

Thank you for bringing attention to the extreme shortage of mental health services for children and adolescents in our area. As a social worker who specialized in children's services in Fort Myers prior to my retirement, I saw firsthand the devastation experienced by children and youth, as well as their siblings, parents, and the larger community, because there were no services available locally.

Families, no matter how motivated, can only do so much. Public schools, already stressed by inadequate resources, cannot cope with the unmet psychiatric needs of students and the education of other pupils is compromised. When we don't provide timely access to required care, we undermine our own future.

Amy Palmer Henry, Fort Myers

Sour deal

Why are we continuing to subsidize the sugar industry to the tune of $3 billion-$4 billion a year?

We consumers spend twice the amount for sugar as the rest of the world because of these subsidies. In return for this sweet deal, they send us polluted, nutrient laden water. This is insanity.

Drop the subsidies and trade protection thus letting free market forces fall where they may and import sugar. You do not need WaterTask Force for this, you need an economist.

This is nothing more than corporate welfare. My guess is until the state suffers greater than $3 billion-$4 billion in economic losses because of this insane policy, nothing will change.

627,Mom of Maleah Davis makes shocking allegations against ex-fiance,"- Four-year-old Maleah Davis has been missing for a week and now community activist Quanell X is speaking out with Maleah's mom, Brittany Bowens.

At a press conference Friday, they threw several allegations at Darion Vence, Maleah's stepfather and Bowen's ex-fiance.

Vence, who is a person of interest in Maleah's disappearance, told police that he, Maleah and his 1-year-old son were abducted by three men. Vence and the boy were released, but Maleah remains missing.

Quanell X and Bowens allege that they have security footage from a neighboring apartment that shows Vence walking in and out of their apartment with multiple bottles of bleach. Later, he's said to be seen walking out with a garbage bag stuffed into a laundy hamper.

Bowens said that he told her he was cleaning the apartment. This would have been during the time that Bowens was out of town.

The footage is said to be in the hands of law enforcment to aid in their investigation.

Quanell also claims Vence had a history of violence against Maleah, that included spankings and beatings.

Bowens thinks Vence may have snapped because they got into a fight after she says she caught him sending explicit pictures to another man. She confronted him about being gay and then broke things off with him.

This comes just a day after police discovered the car that was stolen from the family in a Missouri City parking lot.

Little Maleah has been missing for a week.

628,Ormond Beach man charged in Flagler hit-run death,"An Ormond Beach man suspected of being the driver in a hit-and-run accident last year that killed a Flagler County school bus driver was arrested Thursday and charged with leaving the scene of an accident with death.

BUNNELL — An Ormond Beach man suspected of being the driver in a hit-and-run crash in 2018 that killed a Flagler County school bus driver was being held in the Flagler County jail Friday charged with leaving the scene of an accident with death, booking records show.

Brian Brown, 59, of Sunny Shore Drive in Ormond Beach, was arrested Thursday. His bail was set at $25,000.

[READ ALSO: Flagler school bus driver killed in I-95 hit-run wreck]

Florida Highway Patrol investigators described Brown as ""remorseful"" when they tracked him down the day after the March 26, 2018, hit-and-run crash on Interstate 95 in Flagler County.

Troopers armed with a search warrant showed up at Brown's Sunny Shore Drive home and seized the 2010 Jeep Wrangler they suspected he was driving when it crashed into a Toyota Corolla that had struck a guard rail and veered into northbound traffic.

[READ ALSO: Suspect found in hit-run wreck that killed Flagler school bus driver]

Raymond Almodovar, 68, of Ormond Beach, a Flagler County school bus driver, was driving the Toyota and died at the scene.

Witnesses told troopers that the driver of the Wrangler got out to assess the damages before climbing back into his vehicle and leaving.



Brown told troopers who showed up at his house the next day that he left the scene of the accident because he had a suspended license and stated, ""it's me, I had my boss give you guys a call.""

Almodovar was a well-known bus driver who had worked for the Flagler County school district since July 2013. He drove three routes, ferrying students at Flagler Palm Coast High, Buddy Taylor Middle and Old Kings Elementary schools.

The crash occurred at mile marker 282, about a mile south of State Road 100 in Palm Coast, just before 6 a.m. March 26 and closed the interstate’s northbound lanes as far south as northern Volusia County for several hours.

629,NASA is using the same spacesuits astronauts wore 30 years ago. Experts say that needs to change.,"When astronauts Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson conducted the space shuttle program’s first spacewalk in 1983, they probably wouldn’t have imagined their spacesuits would still be in use on the International Space Station some 36 years later.

Not only are they still in use but the suits, intended to last 15 years, are currently the only ones available for astronauts whizzing around Earth at thousands of miles per hour.

Now, as NASA prepares to head back to the moon, the agency must scramble to develop a next-generation suit or the next American astronauts will be forced to don some hand-me-down, 1980s equipment.

Sure, the suits get updated after six years in orbit or 25 spacewalks, but with outdated technology and only a limited quantity available, the fact of the matter is the nearly 40-year-old suits NASA employs will not serve the needs of future moonwalkers.

The current spacesuits are expected to last until 2028 – four years after NASA hopes to land astronauts on the moon again.But a series of incidents and issues from the spacesuits suggests the need for change is more urgent. A recent example is the all-female spacewalk cancellation in March, which instead had a male and female astronaut perform the walk.

NASA has known for a while that it needs to update its spacesuits. The agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel reiterated the urgency to develop the next-generation suit during a meeting last month.

Astronaut Story Musgrave performs the first EVA of the space shuttle program on April 7, 1983, during STS-6. (Photo: NASA)

In 2017, a similar report by NASA's inspector general came to the same conclusion and stated ""the agency remains years away from having a flight-ready spacesuit capable of replacing the EMU or suitable for use on future exploration missions.""

EMUs, or Extravehicular Mobility Units, are the current suits used on the ISS.

Considered to be a “mini spacecraft” in itself, the spacesuit astronauts currently wear to survive the harsh environment of space is complex and requires major modifications based on the user.

""The EMU, of course, is very bulky. It's a big, bulky, awkward suit to work in,"" former NASA astronaut Winston Scott told FLORIDA TODAY. ""But your life depends on it. It is a totally self-contained life support system.""

Since the retirement of the shuttle program in 2011, ""NASA has had limited ability to return the EMUs from the ISS because only one of the commercial vehicles that ferry supplies to the station has the capability to return items to Earth,"" according to the inspector general's report.

""As a result, astronauts are using the EMUs for much longer periods of time between maintenance and refurbishment than originally intended,"" the report reads.

And only 11 of the 18 ""EMU Primary Life Support System units,"" backpack-like structures required to keep astronauts alive when conducting spacewalks, are still in use. Five were destroyed in the Challenger and Columbia disasters as well as the SpaceX cargo mission that broke apart in 2015. Another was lost during ground testing and the last was built for certification only and is not suitable for flight.

NASA has had years to develop a next-generation spacesuit, but a ""lack of a formal plan and specific destinations for future missions has complicated spacesuit development,"" the report noted.

Starting in 2005 with the establishment of the Constellation program, which called for the development of a suite of vehicles to take astronauts back to the moon and beyond, NASA has spent almost $200 million on three spacesuit development efforts.

On May 1, NASA said on Twitter there would be a ""transition suit"" for the first mission to return to the moon that would include modern designs for astronauts to explore the lunar surface. As to what those advancements will be or what the transition suit will entail, the agency is still unsure.

""We’re looking at internal and external options for a transition spacesuit for the Moon 2024 landing with American astronauts as well as options for modern spacesuits for sustainable surface missions,"" NASA spokeswoman Cheryl Warner said.

Possible future spacesuits

As part of 18 studies being funded by NASA, the SmartSuit project would be an intelligent suit that would increase human performance and allow astronauts to travel to other celestial bodies like the moon and Mars. (Photo: NASA)

On the local front, Florida Institute of Technology academics have their own ideas on how to upgrade NASA's spacesuits.

In 2016, Ondrej Doule, director and founder of the university's Human Spaceflight Laboratory, along with students and team members, won the grand prize for their design of the interior of a single-person spacecraft in the Genesis Engineering Solutions competition.

The ""Wholly Human Integrated Single Person Spacecraft"" could replace the current spacesuits, Doule said. Instead of modeling the single-person spacecraft to look like a suit, the device would essentially become a mini-spacecraft with robotic arms and would have enough room for one astronaut.

Not only could any astronaut perform spacewalks regardless of their body shape, the walks would also be safer to perform because the robotic arms, operated by the astronauts, would do all the repairs needed outside of the space station instead of actual people, Doule said.

Though NASA does not know what the next spacesuit will look like, the agency is casting a wide net in its search.

As part of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, the agency is funding 18 studies, one of which includes the development of a ""SmartSuit,"" an intelligent suit designed with self-healing skin and data collection for spacewalks in extreme environments, NASA said last month.

The SmartSuit could be used to travel to other celestial bodies like the moon and Mars, and will incorporate ""soft-robotics technology that allows astronauts to be highly mobile and better interact with their surroundings,"" according to the release.

The $125,000 project, however, is only in the first phase and can only receive additional funding after successful studies and a transition to the second phase.

Scott, who conducted three spacewalks in NASA's current spacesuit, has his own wishes for how future suits should operate.

""An ideal spacesuit would be one that you don't even think about while you're wearing it,"" Scott said. ""So that means the suit would be light. It would fit you, it wouldn't be big and bulky.""

Instead of inhibiting movement, vision or restricting the astronaut in any way, Scott hopes for a much lighter, tighter-fit suit that still protects the astronaut. He also wouldn't mind an ""Iron Man"" version of a spacesuit.

""Perhaps the suit will be smaller and lighter than what we have, but maybe with some human assist functions like some robotics inside the suit to help you move,"" Scott said. ""Like the suits we develop for our military, the super soldier suits. Like the real version of Iron Man.""

Current suits won't work for deep space missions

With the race back on to send humans to the moon again by 2024, why won't the current spacesuits work if they've already been approved to last until 2028?

According to the inspector general's report, spacesuit requirements vary for each mission. A spacesuit designed for the moon has different needs than one for Mars since ""each destination has different temperatures, radiation levels, pressures, mobility requirements, and exposure to dust and debris.""

Though the current spacesuits are sufficient for use aboard the space station, it won't suffice for deep space exploration missions.

""For example, the current EMU lacks the hip and flexibility needed to walk on and explore planetary surfaces,"" the report reads.

Typically, spacesuits are designed with the mission in mind.

Custom-fit suits were made specifically for astronauts of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions. But with the shuttle program, NASA took a different approach.

As the astronaut class grew larger, it became too expensive to custom-tailor each suit to each astronaut. Instead, NASA’s current suits are a combination of several detachable parts that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

This allows multiple astronauts to wear the same suit, something the agency has done since the 1980s. But that's not to say they haven't come with their own sets of issues.

In March, NASA was planning the first all-female spacewalk with astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch. But a lack of readily available spacesuits aboard the space station prevented a historic event from occurring.

With limited sizes available, sometimes astronauts — usually females — cannot perform spacewalks due to sizing issues with available spacesuits, NASA design engineer Elizabeth Benson said in a 2009 paper named ""Complexity of Sizing for Space Suit Applications.""

This was essentially the problem with the planned all-female spacewalk – both McClain and Koch required mediums, but there was only one on board that would be ready in time, NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz said. The spacewalk did happen, just not with two female astronauts. Instead, NASA astronaut Nick Hague took over McClain's spot and accompanied Koch on the walk.

A simple solution would have been making more sizes available, but due to high costs, NASA had to downgrade the options to only medium, large and extra large sizes, preventing smaller astronauts from wearing the suits and conducting spacewalks.

And if limited sizing and quantity weren't already issues, according to NASA, a spacesuit weighs approximately 280 pounds on the ground. In space, it may not weigh anything, but that still doesn't mean astronauts aren't carrying around all that mass, Scott said.

""Its bulk makes it difficult to work in and some of the smaller stature people or some of the weaker physical people can't manipulate the suit,"" Scott said. ""And of course, they may or may not be able to conduct a spacewalk.""

Kathryn Sullivan, the first American woman to perform a spacewalk in 1985, had her own issues with the suit. In an interview with Outside Magazine in April, Sullivan explained how the suit never fit her correctly.

""The suit's knee was a bit above mine,"" she told the magazine. ""Every time I needed to bend, I wasn't bending a natural joint.""

Astronaut Linda Godwin also told the magazine the shoulders of the spacesuit were the biggest issue.

The suits were initially designed to fit a wide variety of both women and men, but that changed after the agency cut back in sizes.

Astronaut Peggy Whitson, who holds the American record for time spent in space, said in a documentary interview: ""As a woman, doing spacewalks is more challenging, mostly because the suits are sized bigger than the average female.""

So why is this a big deal?

As men and women of different shapes and sizes join NASA's astronaut corps, a poorly fitted suit not only prevents certain astronauts from conducting spacewalks, but ""can also increase the effort that a wearer must exert to move in the suit, since their joints are not lined up with the suit joints,"" Benson said.

""Also, a poorly fit suit has the potential to actually impinge on the wearer during motion and lead to a reduction in mobility and risk of injury,"" she said.

In space, astronauts are essentially floating within their pressurized spacesuit, Scott said. Because the suit is pressurized, which basically means the suit is inflated like a balloon, a common problem astronauts find when wearing the suit is the ability to bend their joints.

""Imagine you're trying to reach for a tool in space and you're reaching to wrap your fingers around the tool. When you try to close and open your fingers, your suit is working against you because it's pressurized,"" Scott said.

In fact, since they were designed in the 1970s, there have been more than 3,400 anomalies with the current spacesuits, according to the inspector general's report. They range from a loose boot thread to glove damage, uncomfortable body temperatures and helmet water intrusions.

Such was the case in 2013 when European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano reported water, a little over a third of a gallon, in his helmet while conducting a spacewalk. A similar instance occurred again in 2016 with NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra. Both spacewalks were terminated early.

None of the incidents that occurred during spacewalks have resulted in deaths or serious injuries, and only five were terminated early. But that's not to say a new spacesuit isn't necessary for future space exploration.

""As we go forward in space, we need to figure out ways to build suits that provide the protection that you need,"" Scott said. ""But also that are lighter and more flexible and better able to allow a person to work in them.""

630,Now and Then: Leesburg's Getzel's had Holocaust survivor history,"LEESBURG — When Getzel’s Department Store in downtown Leesburg closed its doors in February, it was the end of an era.

Getzel Mularsky, a Holocaust survivor, moved to Florida in 1949 with the family of his wife’s uncle, which raised her. The move not only led to a business career of more than 50 years, it led to a religious vocation as well.

His wife’s uncle, Max Idelson, wanted to do something for Mularsky since he agreed to follow the family south, so Idelson bought a business for him to run.

Leesburg was a very busy town then. Wolf’s clothing store for men was for sale and Mularsky’s father-in-law bought it.

It opened Feb. 1, 1950 and was named Idelson's Dry Goods Store until 1959, when the uncle died. It was then renamed Getzel's Department Store.

But that wasn’t the only business Getzel Mularsky was in. The Lithuanian-born man soon entered God’s business and became a rabbi.

There were only 10 Jewish families in town in 1949 and they took turns holding services on Friday evenings at the homes of the different members.

""When I came here, they found out I could read Hebrew, and the people, they drafted me. That's how I got started as a rabbi,"" Mularsky said in an interview more than 15 years ago. ""I went to seminary in Baltimore. But most of my training was in the old country. In the old country, they start training when you are 5 or 6 years old. You go to Hebrew school.""

He was a teenager living in Lithuania when his family was sent to Concentration Camp Dacha.

Three years later, he was the only family member who left after the camp was liberated.

""I lost my father, my mother and my older sister;"" he said. ""They all perished. I'm the only survivor from my family.""

Mularsky came to the United States in 1947 and stayed with an uncle in Baltimore. His short stay in Baltimore led to his 50-plus-year marriage, his long career as a clothier and his spiritual vocation.

After they were married, they moved to Florida with Betty's father. Her family had lived in Florida, between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach. And her father had property there.

There had been some problem with the real estate office that was taking care of the rental property and Mularsky's father-in-law felt he needed to be close so he wouldn't lose the property.

While there, they visited an uncle in Leesburg and liked what they found. A few months later Mularsky's father-in-law opened up a department store in the old Larsen's Men Store.

In 1953, the fledgling congregation raised $4,000 and borrowed another $4,000 from First National Bank. They built their synagogue for $8,000. And they continue to meet there.

He remained the rabbi for more than 50 years. Mularsky died Dec. 22, 2004.

631,Pinellas County deputies conducting death investigation in Seminole,"SEMINOLE, Fla. (WFLA) – Pinellas County deputies are conducting a death investigation Thursday night.

According to the sheriff’s office, deputies responded to a call to assist fire crews around 5:30 p.m. at Oakhurst Road and 82nd Avenue North in Seminole.

The deceased is an adult man.

The investigation is still in a very preliminary stage and no further information was released.

632,Video shows K-9 chomping on grand theft suspect's leg after pursuit,"MARION COUNTY, Fla. - Video released from the Marion County Sheriff's Office on Thursday shows a K-9 chomping down on a grand theft suspect's calf then violently shaking its head back and forth as the man cries out in pain.

Deputies said the bite came after Daniel Eugene Bolden fled from a traffic stop in a stolen Ford F-150 on April 30.

Dashcam video shows deputies speeding after Bolden on Northwest 100th Street, chasing the suspect for about seven minutes before using stop sticks to puncture three of his tires, forcing him to pull over.

Deputies said they yelled for Bolden to surrender or else they would release K-9 Duder, but video shows Bolden hopping over a fence he crashed into and running to a wooded area.

About two minutes later, Duder caught up with the suspect.

""Get the dog off me, ahh,"" Bolden yelled while his leg was clenched between Duder's teeth, according to the video.

Deputies were able to get the K-9 to release its grip shortly thereafter.

""Moral of the story: Don’t run…Air-One will find you and the K-9s will catch you,"" the Marion County Sheriff's Office wrote in a Facebook post.

Bolden is facing charges of fleeing and eluding, resisting an officer without violence, criminal mischief, burglary, grand theft auto and petit theft.

633,UCF's Milton: 'I'll be playing at a high level again',"- University of Central Florida senior quarterback, McKenzie Milton, is back home in Hawaii for the first time since his leg injury. His rehabilitation started in Florida, and he says he is progressing nicely.

""I felt great, man. It's been a long time coming. Slow, grueling process, but I look at it just knocking it down, block by block, and just taking it one step at a time, literally,"" he said.

Milton says he is as far along as anyone would expect in the recovery process, adding that he doesn't like to stay too comfortable with the status quo.

""I thinking, being an athlete, you have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations and relish in those,"" he says. ""I'm working to get better every day. If it hurts, it's just pain leaving the body, so I'm working my butt off to get back on the field.""

When asked if the rehab has been as painful, if not more painful, than the actual injury, Milton says emphatically, ""one hundred percent"" yes.

""When they're ranking on the leg trying to get range of motion back it's much more painful than the initial injury, but...it's a good pain, because you know you're getting better.""



Milton wants to return to the field as soon as possible, but mostly wants to be functional and healthy at the end of the day.

""Obviously, I want to play football again, but I want to be able to run around one day when I have kids and play in the passes, play soccer....but I still dream about playing football again, and I'm confident I'll get there. I'll be playing at a high level again.""

We all hope so too.

635,Girl's father confronts ice cream truck driver. What happens next?,"JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla. - An ice cream truck driver was arrested Tuesday evening after Jacksonville Beach police said he pushed a girl's father, resisted arrest and had marijuana in his ice cream truck.

According to police, the driver of the ice cream truck, 43-year-old Murat Tastan, was trying to get a girl to come to his vehicle near Seawalk Pavilion.

The 13-year-old girl’s father, who wished to remain anonymous, told News4Jax that she was there with other girls, participating in a gymnastics class, and he was sitting up against a tree nearby when it happened.

""At one point, I heard him play something over his microphone that said, 'Hey, baby.' It was in a baby's voice -- very creepy -- and then he whistled, so my daughter says, 'Hey, Dad. I’m a little bit worried,'"" he said.

The father told police that when he told Tastan to leave, the ice cream truck driver jumped out of his vehicle and aggressively approached him. He said Tastan bumped into his chest, knocking him backward, and cursed at him.

Police said that, when the first officer arrived, the officer saw Tastan try to go after the father again. When the officer tried to calm Tastan down, he resisted, according to an arrest report.

""It took that officer a few minutes. He requested backup because the guy was fighting with him. Another officer came. Then another officer came,"" the girl's father said. ""They finally got him to roll over and comply.""

Cellphone video shows the struggle between the ice cream truck driver and the officers as he continued to yell and move as police tried to handcuff him. Officers said they finally got Tastan to cooperate and placed him in handcuffs.

Tastan was arrested on charges of battery, resisting arrest without violence and possession of marijuana. Police said 2.2 grams of the drug were found inside the ice cream truck.

According to police, a special license is needed to operate an ice cream truck in Jacksonville Beach and Tastan hadn’t renewed his license since 2011.

Fernando Sola, another ice cream truck driver in the area, said not only do ice cream truck drivers need to be licensed, but they need to have a good attitude for the job.

""Police stop me all the time, even if they know me already, but they want to make sure every year that I have the license for Jacksonville Beach and I have all the papers. I have the insurance,"" Sola said. ""If you can’t be good with kids and you can’t be friendly with people, then you have to do something else.""

The 13-year-old’s father, as well as another man who witnessed Tuesday's incident, said they both were already concerned about Tastan, as they had each had other run-ins with him in the past. They said they hope Tastan's arrest will keep him away from the area.

The father said he is relieved he was there when the incident happened, so he could protect his daughter. But he added she's still shaken up.

Tastan, of Jacksonville, was released from the Duval County jail Wednesday on $4,500 bond, online jail records show. He is scheduled to be in court for arraignment at 9:30 a.m. May 22.

On Thursday, News4Jax went by to the address listed on the report for Tastan and a man said he had kicked Tastan out over a year ago because he wasn’t paying rent and that he is likely living out of his truck, which was impounded Tuesday evening.

A closer look at the animal perched atop an electrical pole on Alligator Alley in Collier County confirms that it was a bobcat, and not a Florida panther.

Live traffic camera video footage from the Florida Department of Transportation showed the feline near mile marker 78 on eastbound I-75. The bobcat could be seen sitting atop the pole, scanning the area in.

A utility worker attempted to nudge the bobcat to move it down the pole. Eventually, the bobcat crawled down the pole and ran into the brush.

Florida Wildlife Commission officers are on the scene.

645,Starbucks' history of racial harassment makes its way to Hillsborough County,"MORE ABOUT THE LAWSUIT Man claims he was harassed by Starbucks employees in Brandon

TAMPA, Fla. - A South Florida man is claiming he was the subject of racially-driven harassment at a Brandon Starbucks but it's not the first time the coffee giant has been in hot water.

Last year, two African-American men were arrested for tresspassing while waiting for a friend at a Starbucks in downtown Philadelphia, after an employee refused to allow him to use the restroom, saying it was for paying customers only.

Days later, another viral video surfaced showing an African-American man in the Los Angeles area trying to show that he was denied use of a Starbucks restroom while a white customer was allowed access.

The series of incidents prompted Starbucks to show its 175,000 employees a film about racial bias to lead into a full curriculum on the topic.

In May of 2018, more than 8,000 Starbucks locations, including more than 20 in Hillsborough County, closed for training on the subject of racial bias.

Starbucks later update it's policies, saying anyone could sit in its cafes or use its restrooms, even if they didn't buy anything.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Florida law protects anyone from discrimination based on virtually any personal factors:

""All persons are entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, handicap, familial status, or religion.""

While most lawsuits pertaining to race discrimination stem from employment or racial bias in the workplace, Florida has had seven major lawsuits involving racial discrimnation in the laws ten years ranging from everything to stop-and-frisk situations in Miami to violating the rights of minority voters.

647,Deputies seek man who allegedly dragged a dog behind his truck,"- Deputies are searching for a Florida man who dragged a dog behind his truck.

Over the weekend, a pit bull was found covered in scrapes and cuts after being dragged by a truck down Northcliffe Boulevard in Spring Hill. While being dragged, the dog came loose and flew into the median.

Thankfully, Oliver was found and brought to Nature Coast Animal Wellness & Surgical Center for treatment. He is now healing and is expected to make a full recovery. He will be put up for adoption once healthy.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office says that although a suspect was not immediately identified, deputies have now identified Oliver's owner as 58-year-old Gregory Tousignant.

Witnesses reportedly said that it appeared that Tousignant was unaware that Oliver jumped out of the bed of his truck. However, it is illegal to carry any pet in the bed of a truck that is not properly secured and prevented from jumping out of the moving vehicle.

An arrest warrant has been issued for Tousignant on a misdemeanor charge of Cruelty to Animals, which carries a $1,000 bond.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact the Hernando County Sheriff's Office at 352-754-6830.

649,Second reported case of measles being investigated in Florida,"- The Florida Department of Health are investigating after a second case of measles was reported in Florida.

Officials in Pinellas County announced Wednesday that a 72-year-old man was showing symptoms after he recently took a trip to Asia.

There has been an uptick in measles outbreaks across the country in the past few months.

New York City health officials on Wednesday reported 61 new cases since late last week, pushing this year's nationwide tally past the 667 cases reported for all of 2014. That would make 2019 the worst year for measles since 1994.

Health officials in Florida reported the first case in the state last month involving a man from Broward County.

The number of cases is likely to rise. Measles is highly contagious and can spread through the air when someone coughs or sneezes. And in recent days, Jewish families have been gathering for Passover meals. It can take 10 to 12 days for symptoms to develop.

652,"1 arrested, 3 sought in Vero Beach on 'breach of peace' charge alleging sex in public area off 14th Avenue","Vero Beach Police Department (Photo: LAMAUR STANCIL/TCPALM)

VERO BEACH — One woman has been arrested and three other people have warrants out for their arrest, all accused of having sex in public view downtown one afternoon on 14th Avenue.

Police said they got two calls about two couples, about 10 feet apart, engaging in sexual intercourse in a grassy area of a parking lot in the 1900 block of 14th Avenue in full view of passersby and across the street from a restaurant at about 3:20 p.m. April 28.

Myra Olin, 56, who is homeless in Vero Beach, was arrested Thursday night on a charge of disorderly breach of peace.

Francis Rhinehart, 57; Peter Jankowski Jr., 47; and Lisa Goldenberg, 52, all homeless in Vero Beach, according to police, have open warrants for their arrest on the same charge. As of Friday afternoon, they had not been arrested.

A woman who called police said she was driving by the area when she saw the two couples and was shocked. The woman called police and sent pictures to them.

When officers arrived, they said they saw each couple together.

Jankowski Jr. and Olin told the officers ""we were just messing around.""

Officers said Rhinehart and Goldenberg told them they got ""caught up in the moment.""

Vero Beach police Lt. John Pedersen said the incident is ""unique"" for downtown Vero Beach in broad daylight.

""It's not a call that we typically get,"" he said. ""I mean we have had calls over the years of people on the beach or in a car or something where it was in a more private setting, but this was pretty appalling of these people to be engaged in this type of activity.""

Photos and a video of the two couples were circulated on a Vero Beach community Facebook page, prompting many comments from concerned residents. The images were taken down and reposted a few times before being removed for good.

Pedersen said from what he observed and understood from speaking to two witnesses, sexual organs were not plainly observed. He said one of the men's buttocks was clearly seen, but that isn't enough to charge someone with anything more than disorderly breach of peace.

""Do we normally have people having sex openly out in public, no, the answer to that is no,"" Pedersen said.

653,"Former Palm Bay deputy manager Dave Isnardi arrested, charged with racketeering, other felonies","CLOSE FLORIDA TODAY's Wayne Price talks about David Isnardi's resignation as deputy city manager of Palm Bay and how it will affect his wife, Brevard County Commissioner Kristine Isnardi. Video posted Aug. 29, 2017, by Jennifer Sangalang, FLORIDA TODAY. Wochit

Former Palm Bay Deputy City Manager Dave Isnardi has been arrested on charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit extortion and conspiracy to possess controlled substances including oxycodone.

Isnardi is the husband of Brevard County Commissioner Kristine Isnardi.

Dave Isnardi is being represented by Bryan Lober, an attorney who is also a county commissioner. Lober said he has told the Isnardis not to comment on the case to the media.

A second man, Jose Aguiar, a former candidate for the Palm Bay City Council, was also arrested Friday morning and charged with racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering. Aguiar was convicted of conspiracy to sell cocaine in Massachusetts in 1997 and was sentenced to three years and one month in federal prison. It is not clear when he moved to Palm Bay.

Archive Dave Isnardi story: Explosive allegations leveled by Palm Bay veterans chief

All told, Isnardi is charged with two first-degree felonies, which each carry potential penalties of 30 years in prison and three third-degree felonies, each of which carry a potential five-year prison sentence.

The two are being held without bail until they can appear before a judge.

The arrest warrants for the two show that the FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement have been investigating allegations of corruption and undue influence on city officials in Palm Bay since at least 2015. The warrants draw heavily from secret recordings made by a confidential source working with investigators.

The arrest warrants for the two paint a picture of Palm Bay’s city government embroiled in scandal, as Aguiar attempted to influence city officials. Though not arrested or charged, the warrants allege that City Councilman Jeff Bailey had an addiction to oxycodone and that former Councilman Tres Holton regularly had sex with prostitutes and used cocaine. It also alleges that Holton had obtained prostitutes for Mayor William Capote while the men were in Tallahassee.

The arrest warrants allege Isnardi and Aguiar were plotting to use a hidden camera to record Holton and Bailey having sex with prostitutes at “the Clubhouse,” a Canova Street home then owned by Aguiar, where Holton, Bailey and other Palm Bay officials hung out. They then planned to use those recordings to blackmail Holton and Bailey into voting the way Aguiar wanted on various issues including rezoning a property that Aguiar owned to allow him to open a scrap metal business that Isnardi would be a partner in.

It isn't clear from the arrest documents whether the two ever did set up a camera or make any recordings.

“Is this a joke?” Holton said, when contacted by FLORIDA TODAY and told the allegations against him in the arrest warrants. “You’re going to have to call me back,” Holton said, not responding further to questions.

Bailey could not be immediately reached for comment.

Archive Dave Isnardi story: ""Homes for Warriors"" program under state scrutiny

Archive Dave Isnardi story: Controversy ... Here's what happened to Space Coast Paratroopers Association

The warrants also say that Isnardi and Aguiar plotted to plant drugs in Bailey’s car and arrange for a Brevard County sheriff’s deputy to perform a traffic stop on Bailey and to discover the drugs. The warrants also state that former City Manager Gregg Lynk was aware of the plot to set up Bailey, but didn’t want to know the details or participate in the effort.

Lynk could not be reached immediately for comment. He was fired in November after the city council voted to remove him by a 3-2 vote. Bailey introduced that measure and Capote voted in favor of the firing along with newly elected Councilman Kenny Johnson.

The warrants also indicate that Aguiar had previously supplied Bailey with drugs and that he also offered Bailey money to make a down payment on a house, which Bailey declined.

During a subsequent interview with investigators, Bailey admitted that Aguiar offered him a house and that he received $300 in cash from Aguiar, according to arrest documents. Bailey didn’t report Aguiar’s donation, which he held onto until turning it over to the FBI during the interview.

In a subsequent interview with the FBI, set up by Isnardi's then attorney John Murphy, Isnardi admitted to participating in discussions about trying to record Holton and Bailey in compromising positions, according to the arrest documents.

But he denied there was an actual plot to plant drugs in Bailey's car. He did admit, though, that contacted Brevard County Sheriff's Office Agent Jason West about the possibility that there were drugs in Bailey's car and noted that Bailey ""was doing drugs anyway.""

Ultimately, Isnardi claimed the plot was only ""guys talking s---, drinking beers and smoking cigars,"" according to the arrest documents.

CLOSE On day of ex-Palm Bay deputy manager Dave Isnardi's arrest, Thomas Gaume, who ran for City Council in 2018, talked about problems with city leadership Tim Shortt, FLORIDA TODAY

The arrest documents show that Aguiar was angry about how Bailey was voting during council meetings and was determined to drive him from office.

""I’m going to kick his ass, he ain’t winning again.” Aguiar was quoted as saying during one recorded conversation. “I don’t know if I should just approach him and grab him by the throat and tell him how it is, or we should, or I should just avoid him…set this m-----f----- up or something?”

Capote said he was surprised to learn from FLORIDA TODAY that his name was mentioned in the arrest warrant as being connected with prostitutes.

He said those allegations are untrue.

“I don’t know who would tell someone that,” Capote said. “That’s profound. This is all new to me. That accusation has no validity.”

Capote said he has been in Tallahassee in the past on city business, meeting with state legislators and other state officials, but he did not hang out with Holton while he was there.

Capote says people may have been trying to taint him for political reasons.

Capote said he was never interviewed by investigators, and that he has no reason to secure a lawyer in this matter.

Lober, the county commissioner representing Isnardi, said that being accused of something is the same as being convicted.

""Dave hasn’t been convicted of anything in relation to these years-old hyper-political allegations. Given the number of individuals allegedly involved and the complexity of the allegations, this is not a case which is likely to be resolved quickly. I have no doubt that the facts will become increasingly clear in the coming months.”

Shows



Flashlight Cabaret image courtest of Orlando Fringe.

From comedy to musicals to spoken word and dance, there are endless performances to attend. The selection can be a bit overwhelming, but luckily, there's a tool to help. The masterminds behind the festival designed the Fringe-O-Matic website to help you plan your festival schedule. To use it, go to the list of shows and choose the options that interest you the most. You have the option to filter by genre and age rating to help you narrow the titles down. Once you've made your selections, you can generate a schedule based on your interests and availability.

Keep in mind that some shows do feature nudity, flashing lights, adult themes and more, so you'll want to chose shows that are most suited with your comfort level.

Among the standout titles are ""Florida Man,"" an interactive comedy based on the Sunshine State's anti-hero; ""Winnie’s Rock Cauldron Cabaret,"" featuring the Sanderson sisters from the Disney Halloween classic ""Hocus Pocus;"" and ""American Homelessness,"" an immersive experience designed to highlight the perils a homeless person faces all while educating the audience on how they can help solve the epidemic.

Featured events include local comedian Rauce Padgett, who you may recognize from his parody video about the I-4 eyesore and his spoof Orlando movie trailer, hosting a 90-minute ""Tonight at Midnight"" performance done in a late-night talk show format that promises to bring laughs and the Flashlight Cabaret, which bills itself as a ""variety show like no other"" where the sole lighting is provided by audience members clutching flashlights.

Tickets

There are two things you need to get into any Fringe show: a ticket and a button. Artists set the price for tickets, ranging anywhere from free to $12. A $1.25 fee added to the cost of the ticket is given to the ticketing company, while the base cost goes directly to the artist. Buttons are available for $10 each and can be used to get into multiple shows, meaning you don’t have to buy individual buttons the way you would tickets, so one button can last you the duration of the festival.

Tickets can be purchased at the venue, at any of the boxes and online in advance, which is recommended for popular showings. Children 12 and under don’t need a button but do need a ticket, while babies don’t need either. Ticket sales are final, so the only time a refund will be issued is if the performer cancels.

Even if you have a ticket, you won't be admitted into the venue if you're late and there's no re-entry if you decide to leave at any point during the performance, so make sure you get there on time.

657,Holiday creeper asks young girls for sex near bus stop,"Holiday creeper asks young girls for sex near bus stop Video

HOLIDAY, Fla. (WFLA) - An incident near a Pasco County school bus stop has an entire neighborhood frightened.

Two young girls told deputies a man in a car asked them to perform sexual acts.

It happened just before 8 a.m. Thursday morning.

Two girls walking along Ironware Drive near Pleasure Drive got the scare of their lives when a creeper stopped and asked for sex.

A neighbor's security camera recorded the girls, ages 12 and 14, walking to their bus stop.

A man driving a silver 4-door, possibly a Hyundai Genisis, slows, then stops.He takes off when he spots the school bus.

“They were scared. They were in shock. And they tell me they wish they would have done more. But they were scared,” said the girls' mother, Jill, who asked we not use her last name.

She said the incident traumatized them and it makes her wonder about safety in the neighborhood.

“It scares me to think that my daughters can't even walk down the street to get on the school bus, ya know? 7:40 in the morning, my children should be able to walk down the street,” said Jill.

Parents are convinced, this isn't the first time the same guy has struck.

Two months ago, another mother believes he approached her 14-year-old daughter as she checked the mailbox.

“By the time I heard her screaming, that I came out, I ran a little bit towards where the car was, he was too fast for me. I couldn't get his tag or anything,” said Natalie, who also asked not to use her last name.

This time, the creeper didn't mention sex.

“She says that what she heard him say was 'come here, come here.' And that's when she ran and started screaming,” said Natalie.

The school bus stop incident is prompting these parents to make changes in their routines.

“They're not leaving my sight. I'm [driving] them to the bus stop every day,” said Jill.

For the creeper, Natalie has this message.

“He really needs to stop doing this. He needs to turn himself in. I think this is very very very wrong, what he's doing. Especially to little girls.They're terrified,” said Natalie.

The sad thing is, their bus stop is only two streets away.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/holiday-creeper-asks-young-girls-for-sex-near-bus-stop/1993375277,2019-05-10T00:31:08Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

659,Police chase suspect on foot after vehicle pursuit,"- A man wanted out of Pennsylvania is behind bars, after a big takedown in Florida. It surprised many residents in the Town of Windermere, who were just getting ready to start their day.

It began as a traffic stop for a speeding violation. Officers say 41-year-old Jason Baldwin refused to stop, but when he did eventually pull over, he got out of his vehicle and fled on foot.

A chase in a usually quiet, residential neighborhood ensued, as children headed to school. Officers say Baldwin tried hiding outside Gracie Freeman’s home, in an effort to elude officers.

""He saw my dad was checking the sprinklers and he rolled out and went there and tried to go through this gate here,” explained Freeman. “We locked all the doors and just sat in the closet and waited.”

Freeman said she saw the suspect run away from the house, across the street, jumping over a fence into people’s yards.

“Everyone was freaking out.”

”He had gone into several back yards. We had school children waiting at the bus stops in the area. We had individuals walking through the side streets,”

said Deputy Chief Jennifer Treadwell of the Windermere Police Department.

During the chase, an officer suffered a cut to his leg, Treadwell said.

“When he was running after the suspect, he threw the trash cans in his path to toward his efforts to take him into custody, so fortunately his injuries are minor.”

A K-9 officer was able to track Baldwin and catch him nearby. He is wanted for an occupied burglary in Harrisburg, PA. Now, he faces additional charges of fleeing and eluding, aggravated battery, burglary, and resisting with violence.

2 young girls told deputies, a man in a car asked them to perform sexual acts.

It happened just before 8 on Thursday morning.

2 girls walking along Ironware Drive near Pleasure Drive, got the scare of their lives when a creeper stopped and asked for sex.

A neighbor's security camera recorded the girls, ages 12 and 14, walking to their bus stop.

A man driving a silver 4-door, possibly a Hyundai Genisis, slows, then stops.He takes off when he spots the school bus.

“They were scared. They were in shock. And they tell me they wish they would have done more. But they were scared” said the girl’s mother, Jill, who asked we not use her last name.

She said the incident traumatized them, and makes her wonder about safety in the neighborhood. “It scares me to think that my daughters can't even walk down the street to get on the school bus, ya know? 7:40 in the morning, my children should be able to walk down the street” said Jill.

Parents are convinced, this isn't the first time the same guy has struck. 2 months ago, another mother believes he approached her 14 year old daughter as she checked the mail box. “By the time I heard her screaming, that I came out, I ran a little bit towards where the car was, he was too fast for me. I couldn't get his tag or anything” said Natalie, who also asked not to use her last name.

This time, the creeper didn't mention sex. “She says that what she heard him say was ""come here, come here."" and that's when she ran and started screaming” said Natalie.

The school bus stop incident is prompting these parents to make changes in their routines. “They're not leaving my sight. I'm riding them to the bus stop every day” said Jill.

For the creeper, Natalie has this message: “He really needs to stop doing this. He needs to turn himself in. I think this is very very very wrong, what he's doing. Especially to little girls. They're terrified” said Natalie.

Sad thing is, their bus stop is only 2 streets away.

661,Pasco deputies searching for man who made in appropriate comments to young girls,"- The Pasco County Sheriff's Office hopes someone recognizes a driver who allegedly made inappropriate comments to two girls walking to school.

663,"Men accused of stealing cars, fleeing arrest face judge","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - A man accused of stealing two vehicles and speeding through multiple counties as authorities tracked his movements by air was ordered to be held without bond during a court appearance Thursday morning.

Orange County deputies said Wednesday's incident began when they saw a stolen truck in the area of East Colonial Drive and Avalon Park Boulevard. As authorities followed the vehicle without their lights activated, the occupants parked the truck and got into a white Dodge Charger.

Jacob Scott, 22, was driving the stolen Charger with passengers 19-year-old Roil Cambio and a 13-year-old boy inside on Wednesday, according to the affidavit.

Sky 6 video from the incident showed the Charger speeding on State Road 520 as authorities tracked it by air.

Records show Scott bailed out of the Charger on Wednesday and hopped onto a stolen motorcycle. The two other suspects fled on foot but were eventually caught, according to authorities.

Deputies said Scott was arrested at about 11:40 a.m. in the 16300 block of East Colonial Drive, where he abandoned the motorcycle.

Scott and Cambio are both facing multiple charges of grand theft. Cambio's bond was set at $11,450 on Thursday.

Court records show Scott has gone to jail at least three times since January.

The 13-year-old suspect is expected to face a judge at the Juvenile Justice Center on Thursday afternoon.

664,Jesse Watters Finds a Way to Jeer Ilhan Omar's Death Threats,"Screenshot: Fox News

Fox News host Jesse Waters—known for spewing racist, sexist putrid garbage all over the network—simply couldn’t help himself on Wednesday evening’s episode of The Five, shit-talking Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and shrugging off the arrests of people who have made threats on her life.



Speaking about Meghan McCain’s appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, where Meyers challenged McCain’s comments tying Omar to anti-Semitism, including the California synagogue shooting, Watters questioned why “the left” would stand up for Omar.



“I think the reason they do that, it’s not because they want to protect her personally, because she’s not that talented, she doesn’t raise a lot of money, she’s not that likable or empathetic,” Watters said. “The left wants to protect the ability of the left to traffic in anti-Semitism.”

Only on Fox News would a woman being “likable” and a “money maker” be a necessary excuse to defend her against threats on her life.

“I don’t think you want to be [to the left] when you’re in line for that late night show, and when everybody gets death threats. McCain gets them big time. We get them, we don’t whine about them,” Watters said, willfully minimizing the credible threats against Omar and the multiple arrests made in connection to them.



In New York, a man was arrested in April for calling Omar’s office and threatening to “put a bullet in her fucking skull,” later telling FBI agents “if our forefathers were still alive, they’d put a bullet in her head.” Two weeks later, a second man was arrested in Florida after making threats to Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib in a voicemail he left for Tlaib.

“...It was your Taliban, bitch, who fucking opened up her fucking towel head mouth about ‘some people did it,” the Florida man reportedly said. “You know what, she’s lucky she’s just getting death threats...So are you. All right?…‘Cuz the day when the bell tolls…and this country comes to a war, there will be no more threats.”

And a bomb threat was called into the California hotel where Omar made her speech against Islamophobia at the Council on American Islamic Relations of Greater Los Angeles banquet in March. That same month, the FBI opened an investigation into a threat written in a men’s bathroom in a Minnesota convenience store that read, “Assassinate Ilhan Omar.”

665,Man working on roof dead after construction worker's gun accidentally goes off in Hillsborough,"RIVERVIEW, Fla. (WFLA) - The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office is investigating a homicide that occurred Wednesday afternoon.

Officers responded to the area of to the 8900 block of Riverlachen Way in Riverview sometime around 1:45 p.m. The house deputies responded to is being remodeled and no one currently lives there.

According to officials, the shooter, who is part of the construction team, said that he had just gotten out of his vehicle and was moving his gun from his waist band to his pocket when he slipped on construction debris and his gun fired.

The victim, a 44 year old man who was working on the roof, was shot. Detectives explained that the victim was roughly ten feet from the shooter's own son working on the roof at the time.

The victim was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead.

The man who shot the gun is cooperating with deputies. He told deputies that he and the victim are longtime friends.

""I'm so sorry this happened, it's just such a freak accident,"" said Brenda Bingham who lives next door to the house being remodeled on Riverlachen. Bingham was home when the shooting happened but said she didn't notice the gunshot because loud construction noises had been coming from next door all day.

Bingham explained the house has been under construction for about six months. She didn't know the construction workers by name but they would often chat and exchange pleasantries.

In fact, Bingham says she had been in her driveway chatting with the shooter and victim about half an hour before the gun went off.

""It's sad, it really is sad to see that happened,"" she added. ""Very nice people.""

The remodeled home's owner told News Channel 8 over the phone that his prayers go out to the friends and families of those involved.

666,"Suspect in Miami Beach murder claims he's a serial killer, police say","MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - A convicted sex offender accused of killing an elderly Miami Beach man last month has confessed to the crime along with six other murders in Florida, Georgia and California, authorities said.

Ernesto Rodriguez, a spokesman for the Miami Beach Department, said officers could not corroborate the claims of 32-year-old Nicholas Brent Gibson.

Gibson was arrested in New York City on Sunday after a struggle in which at least one officer was injured. The U.S. Marshals Service was also searching for Gibson for a probation violation for failing to register as a sex offender.

Miami Beach detectives interviewed Gibson in New York, where he confessed to the additional killings. Officers are now working to determine whether the confessions are credible, Rodriguez said.

Police said he killed 77-year-old Erik Stocker. Officers found Stocker dead April 30 inside his unit at the Tribeca apartments in the 1500 block of Michigan Avenue after neighbors noticed a foul order coming from the apartment. Police said he had been dead for about 10 days.

Detectives have not said how Stocker was killed or released a motive for the killing. However, the Miami Herald has reported that sources said Gibson used ""some type of sword"" to kill Stocker.

Rodriguez said detectives have found additional physical evidence linking Gibson to the murder. He said Gibson will be charged once he is transported back to Miami Beach.

The home's resident, Jennifer Holly Campbell, 36, was arrested when deputies reportedly found meth, heroin, marijuana and Oxycodone pills in the house.

Deputies also reported finding drug paraphernalia such as multiple digital scales, plastic baggies and a notebook investigators believe contained prices for the narcotics.

While deputies were searching the home, Phillips reportedly walked up to two deputies in the yard — one with a badge around their neck and another in a Sheriff's Office vest.

Phillips told the deputies he was there to see Campbell, and the deputies searched him. According to the report, they found meth in his pocket and took him into custody.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - Domingo German became the majors' first seven-game winner, Gio Urshela got a key hit set up by a pair of odd bounces and the New York Yankees beat the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 on Friday night.

The injury-filled Yankees pulled within a half-game of the AL East-leading Rays in the first of 19 meetings between the teams this season.

German (7-1) was matched up against Tyler Glasnow (6-1), who left in the sixth inning with right forearm tightness.

Glasnow struck out nine in 5 1/3 innings. He signaled for a trainer after striking out Gleyber Torres and was pulled.

German allowed three runs and five hits over five innings. Aroldis Chapman, the fourth Yankees reliever, worked the ninth for his ninth save.

Home runs by Austin Meadows and Ji-Man Choi gave the Rays a 3-2 lead entering the sixth.

Gary Sanchez opened the Yankees sixth with an infield single on a popup that struck the highest of four overhanging catwalks - approximately 185 feet high - and fell in the infield as Tampa Bay players scrambled to catch the carom.

Clint Frazier followed with a single and Torres fanned, finishing Glasnow. Emilio Pagan relieved and Miguel Andujar hit a grounder that took a crooked hop off the mound and went for an infield single that loaded the bases. Urshela then delivered a two-run single for a 4-3 lead.

On Thursday night, Urshela entered in the seventh for defense and hit a two-run single in the eighth of a 3-1 victory over Seattle.

The Rays loaded the bases on two walks and a bunt single in the seventh, but Adam Ottavino worked out of the jam by striking out Tommy Pham and getting Choi to hit a grounder that second baseman DJ LeMahieu fielded, raced to second for an out and threw to first to complete a nifty double play.

Meadows, reinstated from the 10-day injured list after missing 15 games with a strained right thumb, hit a two-run homer and Choi added a solo shot two batters later off German as the Rays went up in the fifth. German had allowed just two homers overall in six previous starts.

New York took a 2-0 lead in the first when LeMahieu scored on rookie Nick Ciuffo's passed ball and Torres' RBI single.

The Yankees currently have 12 players on the injured list, including Aaron Judge, Aaron Hicks, Giancarlo Stanton, Didi Gregorius, Luis Severino and James Paxton.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Yankees: LHP Jordan Montgomery (Tommy John surgery) will increase from 30 to 35 pitches and start incorporating curveballs in his next bullpen session Tuesday. ""I'm starting to kind of see some light at the end of the tunnel in the bullpens when I'm throwing the ball and it's going where I want it to,"" Montgomery said. ... Paxton (left knee inflammation) is playing catch.

Rays: 3B Matt Duffy (left hamstring strain) is scheduled to resume a rehab assignment with Class A Charlotte Monday. ... C Mike Zunino (left quadriceps strain) joined backup C Michael Perez (strained right oblique) on the 10-day injured list.

681,"Puppy found badly burned, tossed in trash in Coachella","(CNN/WFLA) - Another horrific case of animal abuse surfaced over the weekend in Coachella, California.

NBC Palm Springs reports a woman found a 2-week-old puppy that had been badly burned and thrown in the trash.

“It was so horrible…sorry,"" Alexandra Zazueta recalled. “Her belly was stuck to a plastic bag and she cried a lot when I was trying to remove her from the plastic bag.”

Zazueta said the puppy smelled like it was rotting and its skin was falling off.

""I visibly saw lacerations down from her mid back all the way to her back legs. Her tail was cut, so her skin flap was just hanging off of her tail,"" she recalled. ""My mom was like you know what. Like maybe she'll pass away. And I was like no we can't give up. But if it happens she's not going to die in a box or in a bag like if she was trash. So (inaudible).""

""The puppy was tossed into this dumpster left to die rotting inside in over 100-degree temperatures. Now the question becomes why does this keep happening?"" said Luzdelia Caballero.

The incident comes weeks after Deborah Caldwell, 53, was seen tossing seven puppies in a dumpster in the same town. She was charged with seven felony counts of injuring the 3-day-old puppies and seven misdemeanor counts of abandoning them. She could face a maximum of seven years in prison.

""As much as we are shocked and then of course saddened to see the penalties not maybe as stiff as everyone would like to see, it's just that's the reality in California,"" said a man interviewed by the station. ""There are a lot of people harming humans and have been convicted and then released. So it's our world.""

The puppy is recovering at a clinic and is said to be on the up and up. It already has a new name and a home.

“Yes, Hope has a home and she has four other dogs waiting for her. And we are so happy and can’t wait to bring her home.”",https://www.wfla.com/national/puppy-found-badly-burned-tossed-in-trash/1994299047,2019-05-10T12:41:14Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

683,Autographs and action at 5 Flags Meet the Drivers Night,"CLOSE Chase Purdy wins weather plagued Allen Turner Snowflake 100 amid terrible weather at Five Flags Speedway Bill Vilona, bvilona@pnj.com

Bill Tutchtone figures he was a few laps away from heading back into retirement.

Tutchtone, 46, raced once in 2012 and hadn’t raced a full schedule at Five Flags Speedway since the late 2000s.

He wasn’t feeling like a comeback tour was a smart idea following a ninth-place finish in the Faith Chapel Outlaws season opener on March 9 during the ARCA Menards Series Pensacola 200.

“I’m very competitive. Around Valentine’s this year, I was so nauseated thinking about how bad I’d do,” Tutchtone said. “I was real apprehensive about it. Then, after the ARCA race, I was seriously thinking that if I did not perform well at the next practice, I was going to tell (car owner Ronnie Enfinger) to put somebody else in the car.”

Thankfully, it all clicked at the next Outlaws feature last month.

Tutchtone slid by defending Outlaws Snowball Derby champion Jeremy Pate 10 laps from the white flag and pulled away from the rest of the field to collect his first career Outlaws victory and his first checkered flag in a decade.

“Honest to God, it was the wildest thing I’ve ever been a part of,” Tutchtone said. “The emotions everybody else had, man People that have known me for years that you wouldn’t necessarily think would have those emotions. They were speechless and couldn’t get out what they wanted to say.

“A lotta things have changed. A lotta things have happened. But, it still felt like one big family.”

Tutchtone along with Five Flags’ most competitive division are back in action on tonight's Meet the Drivers Night at the famed half-mile asphalt oval.

The WCIparts.com Pro Trucks, The Dock on Pensacola Beach Sportsmen, and the Lloyd’s Glass Pure Stocks round out a blockbuster group of drivers, who will sign autographs, hand out hero cards and other souvenirs on the front straightaway.

Gates open at 5 p.m. today, qualifying is set for 6:45, and racing will begin approximately at 8. Admission is $15 for adults; $12 for seniors, military, and students (ages 12-17); and free for children 11-and-under.

Tutchtone has been coming to Pensacola’s high banks since he was a three-year-old toddler. To get a chance to interact with the fans rekindles his own nostalgia.

Bubba Winslow, another Outlaws driver, shared his memories of meeting drivers as a kid.

“(Meet the Drivers Night) was one of the biggest things I remember as kid,” Winslow said. “You couldn’t get into the pits back then. I remember watching guys like Okie Mason. He was always super nice. He never had a bad attitude, and was one of the guys I always looked up to.

“It’s something special when you see kids down there on the track. They recognize the car before the driver, but then they make the connection.”

Winslow, who leads the Outlaws points standings through two races, owns a pair of top-four finishes.

“This class, you go to the racetrack, and five people could win,” Tutchtone said. “You have to be on top of your game to beat ‘em. That’s the kinda stuff I like. I love seeing this class grow.”",http://rssfeeds.pnj.com/~/601820454/0/pensacola/home~Autographs-and-action-at-Flags-Meet-the-Drivers-Night/,2019-05-10T10:30:26Z,Pensacola News Journal,Florida Man,"101 E Romana St, Pensacola, FL 32502, USA",FL,32502
684,"Sanibel officer remembered as excellent officer, better person, chief says","CLOSE FHP Master Sgt. Daniel Hinton's funeral procession Michael Braun, MBRAUN@NEWS-PRESS.COM

The Sanibel police officer who died after a training exercise Monday was known as an excellent officer and an even better person.

Officer Anthony Neri, 63, began his career with the department in 2012 as a civilian police aide working traffic, and was promoted as a full-time patrol officer in 2015.

He always had a positive attitude, Sanibel Police Chief William Dalton said.

""The traffic job can be very trying, but he excelled at it,"" Dalton said. ""He always had a smile on his face. It's hard to believe you can do that kind of job and keep such a positive attitude.""

Neri was participating in a training exercise when he collapsed, according to a news release. He was taken to Health Park Hospital in Fort Myers, where he died.

More: Sanibel Police Officer dies after training exercise

Sanibel officials said Thursday that he was participating in a Physical Abilities Test proctored by Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno at the Lee County Sheriff's gun range.

The test simulates what an officer would experience on duty, and evaluates essential knowledge, skills and abilities required of an entry-level officer, according to city documents.

In six minutes and four seconds, officers sprint a few hundred yards, drag a 150-pound dummy and complete other tasks, including an obstacle course, that test physical skills they'd need in the field.

It's unclear which task Neri was completing when he collapsed.

Neri is the second officer in Southwest Florida to die in a training exercise this year. A member of the Florida Highway Patrol, Master Sgt. Daniel Hinton, 56, suffered a heart attack during a training exercise February 19 and died at Gulf Coast Medical Center.

Experts say deaths during training can happen for a number of reasons that can vary across agencies.

Seth Stoughton, an associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina, said either the training is appropriate and the death, while tragic, is coincidental — or that the training is in fact inappropriate.

""One possibility is that the training was entirely appropriate and these were really unfortunate and tragic events,"" Stoughton said. ""Or the officer might be in the middle of a dynamic defensive tactics training block where their heart rate is up, they're physically straining and they have a heart attack. Then their death may have been the result of training, but that training was still appropriate.""

Sometimes it boils down to inappropriate training, he said. That's training that doesn't simulate conditions the officer would experience on the job.

Once an agency meets state-mandated training requirements, it's free to add additional training. It's up to the agency to make sure the training is appropriate, and to make sure the officer is fit enough to participate, Stoughton said.

For instance, ""you can't expect a 60-year-old officer to do everything a 22-year-old officer could do,"" he said.

Stoughton spent five years as an officer with the Tallahassee Police Department, and has studied policing as an academic for the last seven years.

Neri was seen as a leader in the department, Chief Dalton said.

""He was an older officer, and served as a mentor to some of our newer and younger officers,"" Dalton said. ""He was what we needed as a community police officer. He was excellent at it.""

In 2017, Neri was elected by his peers to serve as their representative on the City of Sanibel Police Pension Board.

Because the department is so small, with fewer than 30 sworn officers, Dalton said he sees those who serve under him every day.

""It's like we've lost someone in our family,"" Dalton said. ""It's just very difficult and tragic.""

Neri had previously worked for three years as a police officer with the Union Township in the New Jersey Police Department, and then spent 30 years as a revenue officer with the United States Department of Treasury.

Neri's mother and wife, both reached Wednesday, declined to comment.

Linda Ruetsch, the officer's former wife of 24 years, said Neri was the nicest man she'd ever met.

""He was very quiet and would never hurt a soul. He really cared about his family, and loved and respected his parents and three sisters,"" Ruetsch said. ""Family was very important to Anthony.""

Neri and Ruetsch met in New Jersey when they were in their early 20s, she said. She was in nursing school, and he was studying to become an officer.

The pair dated for a while, and eventually married, she said. Although they wouldn't remain married for the rest of their lives, things were amicable during the split and they stayed in touch.

Neri spoke often of his plans to retire and move to Florida, Ruetsch said.

""He achieved his dreams,"" she said.

687,Man reunited with stolen motorcycle after recognizing it on the news during police pursuit,"- An Orange County is man is thrilled to be reunited with his motorcycle, just hours after it was stolen.

Chris Rodrigues says his $2,500 bike was stolen early Wednesday morning. but a few hours later, he was shocked to see it on his television. It was during news coverage of a police pursuit in East Orlando, when Rodrigues noticed the bike being chased look awfully similar to his.

“Seen the color bike and said that kind of looks like my bike, I look at it a little more, it’s definitely my bike,” said Rodrigues.

But as Rodrigues was watching the news coverage Wednesday morning, he remembered he left the bike’s gas tank nearly empty.

“That’s why he pulled over, he ran out of gas. I had one bar left and riding like that, you can’t get that far,” said Rodrigues. “It was pretty funny, I was laughing at him on TV.”

He says the lack of gas may be the reason the suspect dumped the bike, ultimately resulting in his capture.

Rodrigues says it is one of the craziest things that ever happened to him. He did not think he would ever see his bike again, so he is happy it is back in his possession.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/man-reunited-with-stolen-motorcycle-after-recognizing-it-on-the-news-during-police-pursuit,2019-05-08T22:53:20Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - A South Florida man on business in the Tampa Bay area claims he was harassed by Starbucks employees at the company's Brandon store.

Lorne Green says he's been to that location before, usually with his white colleague, and never had any problems.

At a news conference on Wednesday, Green explained that his trip to the Starbucks at 2350 West Brandon Boulevard went horribly wrong on April 22.

Green claims he walked in to use the bathroom before placing his order and heard an employee say ""the big black guy is headed for the bathroom.""

As Green used the restroom, he told reporters that employees kept banging on the door asking if he needed fire and rescue.

Green called Starbucks corporate to explain what was happening. He recorded that phone call, playing a part of it for reporters Wednesday afternoon.

He said he began to fear for his life when employees said they were calling the police.

""I felt humiliated,"" Green said. ""Completely defeated. They had wronged me, and now they were going to call the cops on me?""

Hillsborough County deputies arrived and issued him a citation for trespassing, according to Green's attorney, civil rights lawyer Jasmine Rand.

He was told not to return or he would be arrested.

692,Man dies after confrontation with deputies in Sorrento,"SORRENTO — A Leesburg man who injured a deputy during a chase Wednesday morning died hours later at the hospital following a “medical episode,” authorities say.

AdventHealth Waterman staff declared 27-year old Sean Christopher Bentley dead shortly before noon Wednesday. The Lake County Sheriff's Office said he was taken there after suffering an undisclosed medical emergency and passing out as he was being treated by EMS.

Deputies were pursuing Bentley on a warrant for failing to appear in court for previous charges of eluding law enforcement. When a deputy confronted him in the morning, Bentley ran to his car, the Sheriff's Office said. The deputy attempted to pull Bentley out of the car after using his taser, but Bentley reportedly put the car in drive and dragged the deputy some distance, injuring his leg.

Not long later, he crashed his car on County Road 437 while being pursued by another deputy. Florida Highway Patrol reported he rear-ended one vehicle and struck a trailer being pulled the opposite direction by a pickup truck. No one was reported injured in the crash. Bentley attempted to flee on foot right after the crash, but Lt. John Herrell, spokesman for the Lake County Sheriff's Office, said he surrendered to deputies' commands to stop in the area of the Eagle Dunes subdivision in Sorrento.

According to Herrell, Bentley began showing signs of a medical emergency a short while later, and EMS was called to the scene. Bentley was aggressive with EMS personnel, deputies reported, and eventually he passed out and was taken to the hospital.

693,Lehigh Acres man charged in 2018 crash that killed 5-year-old Fort Myers boy,"CLOSE It was a dangerous year on Lee and Collier roads in 2018. Megan Kearney, mkearney@news-press.com

A Lehigh Acres man is facing charges of causing a death while driving without a valid license in a fatal November 2018 crash on Gunnery Road.

Mitchell Buenrostro, 18, remains in Lee County Jail on no bond. He will be arraigned June 20.

A Florida Highway Patrol report said Connor Green, 5, of Fort Myers, was killed in the two-vehicle crash in Lehigh Acres.

The crash happened when Buenrostro, 17 at the time, was driving a 2003 Dodge 1500 pickup westbound on Sunset Road, near the intersection of Gunnery Road.

Buenrostro ran a stop sign at Gunnery, the FHP said, and hit the right side of a 2015 Nissan Quest being driven north on Gunnery by Ashley Green, 33, of Fort Myers.

The impact forced the truck that Buenrostro was driving off the road to the right and it overturned. Green's vehicle traveled off the roadway to the left and struck a ditch.

Connor Green was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash, the FHP said. Ashley Green and a passenger in the Nissan suffered minor injuries. Buenrostro and three teen passengers in the truck also suffered minor injuries.

The crash happened about 1:15 p.m. near Dunn Avenue.

According to the Highway Patrol, a Nissan Frontier was traveling in the inside lane and a Nissan Altima was traveling in the outside lane of northbound I-295 when, for unknown reasons, the Frontier drifted to the right, striking the rear of the Altima.

698,Murderous Dino Bird Kills Florida Man,"Photo: Mark Baker (AP Photo)

Cassowaries are, in a few words, extremely fucked up. They are creatures that, like a great many that live either naturally or unnaturally in Florida, are categorically disinclined to coexist alongside both the past and current iterations of the human species, or any other species for that matter. They are a mix between emus, the cool-but-inaccurate velociraptors of Jurassic Park, and an extremely ornery Florida parent. They are also kings and queens that should be worshipped as the Cretaceous Period royal descendants they are.

A cassowary (it’s unclear what this particular one’s given name is) killed Marvin Hajos, a 75 year old Florida man who kept the enigmatic beast in a cage with another of the species, for “agricultural use.” The reported act of provocation and the violence that followed leading to an auction of the Murder Bird spurred a write-up in the New York Times on Wednesday. The Times did not provide the gory details of how, exactly, Murder Bird did the murder, save for the guilty party’s weapon of choice—a gotdang foot.

Advertisement

To be more specific, a foot like this:

You know what, I’m sorry. These feet are good and scary, yes. They are dinosaur-esque and unnerving and probably should not exist on the same space-time continuum as our big doughy, defenseless meat sacks of bodies haplessly waddling around the planet. Without context, these talons don’t seem much scarier than, say, an eagle’s, which are no doubt terrifying. But Murder Bird’s feet go far beyond anything the human mind can be prepared to comprehend.

Advertisement

Try this one on for scale, from a paleontologist, no less:

No, you are not looking at the foot of a velociraptor perfectly preserved in ice; this is the foot of a creature that is alive and breathing and thirsting for blood right now, at this very minute, somewhere in the world. It’s waiting, not-so-patiently, for an opportune moment to remind you, or whoever dares enters its consciousness, of the mistakes—and, more importantly, the lasting effects—of evolution. Marvin Hajos, god bless him, figuratively flew too close to this flightless beast on April 12 when he went into its cage to collect the dino eggs that this “bird” plops out. Murder Bird saw what Murder Bird sees. It saw a man. It saw its babies. It saw its claw. It saw 65 million years of instinct and training. In one fell swoop, the cassowary made a choice that had been made for it by Mother Nature eons earlier. On that day, a cassowary became Murder Bird, the protector of the realm, destroyer of men, heir to the earthly crown.

704,Former Blue Wahoos manager Pat Kelly awaits flashback as Chattanooga skipper,"CLOSE Blue Wahoos honor manager Pat Kelly, celebrate 2017 championship season Bill Vilona/bvilona@pnj.com

In preparing for Thursday night’s game, Chattanooga Lookouts manager Pat Kelly took a quick glance ahead at the next opponent’s roster.

It was the one presenting an emotional connection. The franchise he spent three memorable seasons managing.

“This will be different, for sure,” Kelly said, laughing, the former Blue Wahoos manager.

While he has no relationship with any current Pensacola players or coaches, Kelly and his pitching coach Danny Darwin recognize how fate presents a unique dynamic.

After last year’s swap of affiliations, 13 former Lookouts players now in Pensacola will reconnect Saturday against Chattanooga to begin a five game road series. Kelly and Darwin will manage against the franchise they once celebrated success. The Lookouts will be in Pensacola on Aug. 13-17.

On Sept. 8, 2017, Kelly and Darwin were doused with champagne at Blue Wahoos Stadium, after the Cincinnati Reds’ former Double-A affiliate won a Southern League co-championship.

The team sharing the title in that hurricane-shortened postseason? The Lookouts, then the Minnesota Twins affiliate.

“I think for both Danny and myself, it will be a strange feeling,” said Kelly about the upcoming series at Chattanooga’s AT&T Stadium. “I think we’ve been in the game long enough, been traded and fired enough, that we’ve done this before. But it’s definitely different.

“We had a great seven-year run (as Reds affiliate) in Pensacola and enjoyed every minute of it. Especially the three years I was there. And now it’s the Twins turn to enjoy Pensacola and hopefully we can come into Chattanooga (this season) and have some fun.”

Adding to the scenario, Kelly managed the Chattanooga Lookouts 25 years ago (1993-94) when they were a Reds affiliate during a 21-year period.

After being named the Blue Wahoos’ third manager in franchise history in December 2014, Kelly steered the ball club to its greatest run of success. The Blue Wahoos reached the playoffs each year, culminating in 2017 with a trophy and championship rings.

During those three seasons, he developed lasting friendships and enjoyed a stadium providing proximity to connect with fans.

“It was just fun to come to the ballpark every day,” said Kelly, 63, a Santa Maria, Calif. native. “It was a great facility, a great city, and the fans who came to the ballpark made it all worthwhile.

“They were very supportive. I made a lot of friends.”

Entering the weekend series against the South division-leading Blue Wahoos, Kelly sees it as a gauge for his North Division team.

“Just glancing at (Blue Wahoos) roster, some of the names are familiar,” Kelly said. “I know just following baseball, they have a lot of the top prospects for the Twins.

“And obviously, looking at the standings, they are off to a great start. So I think it is going to be a really good challenge for us.

The Lookouts (17-14 before Thursday’s game) had a sluggish start, losing seven of eight games, beginning in mid-April. They have since won the past two series, taking four of five games each time.

“We got off to a really bad start with some young players. But we really hit our stride the last couple weeks. I am kinda looking forward to (facing Blue Wahoos), because I think it’s a great challenge for our young kids, just to see how far we have advanced in this first month and a half.

“We came into the year with a lot of questions with the pitching staff. So we felt like it was basically trying to get everyone’s feet wet and see how we did. We split our first two series, which I felt we were fortunate to do.

“Then Mississippi came in and knocked our socks off… they beat us four of five. I think it was eye opening for our players.”

The Lookouts were tied as of Thursday with the Tennessee Smokies for the best team batting average (.255) in the Southern League. Several of their batters among the league’s top 50 – Jose Siri, T.J. Friedl, Gavin LaValley – were in Pensacola last season.

“We are going to try to prove the opposite of what we did in Pensacola… that you can win with offense and give up a lot of runs,” said Kelly, jokingly. “But this is a much better park to hit in (Chattanooga) from an offensive standpoint.

“I think our pitching is starting to settle down. Having Danny working with those guys, they get better every start and the bullpen is starting to solidify a little bit.”

After seeing so many of the players he managed reach the major leagues in recent seasons, Kelly returned last year himself as a bench coach for the Reds. He was in the dugout with then-interim manager Jim Riggleman, the Blue Wahoos manager in their inaugural 2012 season.

Both were elevated after the Reds opted to fire Bryan Price just 18 games into the 2018 season. Riggleman is now bench coach for the New York Mets. After the Reds chose David Bell as new manager and he hired his staff, Kelly opted for a Double-A return in the Reds organization to help players advance.

“(Last year) was fantastic for me,” Kelly said. “It was a great experience to be exposed to the big leagues and get exposed with players who had played for me. You are seeing through their struggles. And to work for Jim Riggleman was fantastic.

“What a terrific man, I love the way he runs a ballgame. He is always two steps ahead of the other manager. It was very educational for me… being able to sit next to a guy who I felt like was one step ahead of me a lot of times.

“So I felt like I got a lot out of it.”

He’s hoping for the same in a new situation this year.

705,"Hunt charged with murder, attempted murder X3 in Cove quadruple shooting","PANAMA CITY — Michael Hunt, the man initially sought as a ""person of interest"" in the April 4 quadruple shooting on Allen Avenue that left one woman dead and three people critically injured is now charged with first-degree murder and three counts of attempted felony murder, Panama City police announced shortly after 3 p.m. today.

Panama City police Friday afternoon announced the arrest of Hunt on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Alexandra “Lexie” Elise Peck, 19. She was one of four people shot late April 4, with three surviving with critical injuries. Hunt is charged with attempted felony murder in each of those shootings. In addition, police have now also charged Hunt with armed burglary of a dwelling and two counts of failure to register as a sex offender.

Hunt has been in custody since April 5, one day after four people were shot in the 100 block of Allen Avenue. He was caught the day after the shooting but until today was charged with Human Trafficking and Sexual Assault from another case, as well as being held without bond for failure to appear on a charge of ""unlawful sex acts with certain minors"" and aggravated assault with a firearm. Hunt actually appeared for that hearing April 1, but disappeared after the prosecutor announced there was a new warrant out for him for sexual battery but a hard copy of it was not on hand.

Three days later the shootings occurred.

The Panama City Police Department has since been working with a bevy of agencies on the case - they maintained the crime scene for a week to gather evidence - which left many in the Cove area frightened and wondering what had actually happened, particularly after Hunt was picked up the day after the shootings but not charged with in connection with them until today.

Police have still released few details about the shootings and did not take any today after issuing the press release. They have said the case is of such a nature that public records laws do not apply to much of the information sought and prevents them from releasing certain details. They have also said the public has provided ""invaluable"" information to investigators.

Hunt, 53 is a registered sex offender, who was set for a hearing April 1 on a new sex charge from last fall. Hunt was at the hearing, but when confusion over a new sex charge brought the hearing to a temporary halt, Hunt was gone when court reconvened and the warrant for sexual battery had been found.

Courtroom video obtained by The News Herald shows Hunt and his appointed attorney at the time standing at one podium and the prosecutor at another.

As the hearing begins at 2:42 p.m., the prosecutor quickly tells the judge, “I believe Mr. Hunt has an active warrant. I was (unintelligible) this morning.”

“A what?” Hunt says, looking back toward the audience in the courtroom.

The judge can be heard a short time later saying, “Yeah, I’m not showing it in (unintelligible) but that doesn’t mean it’s not active.”

The prosecutor then is seen pulling up the information on her smartphone, saying, “A warrant for Michael Harrison Hunt, uh, for sexual battery on a victim under 18.”

Hunt at this point raises his left hand in what looks like a gesture of disbelief.

Hunt’s attorney tells the judge it’s likely just a continuation of the charge Hunt is in court for that day — for which his previously posted $65,000 bond was reduced to a release on his own recognizance bond in November by another judge. Hunt had made his court appearances since then.

“What’s your date of birth, Mr. Hunt?” the judge asks.

“6-1-65, your honor,” Hunt replies.

Using that as a comparison point, the prosecutor a short time later, again using her smartphone, says, “I have it right here” and says that the date of birth matches Hunt’s.

“Alright, well, I’m not going to take any action yet until I see an actual capias has been issued so I’ll wait and see what that is and maybe that will give a chance for Ms. Miron to get with (the prosecutor) to discuss that issue,” the judge says says.

Hunt remains standing by his attorney as the prosecutor asks if they can “just recall the case (when we’ve) sorted it out?”

“You can,” the judge replies. “Mr. Hunt, if you will take a seat and we’ll see if we can get to the bottom of this for you.”

“Yes sir,” Hunt replies, and he is seen walking out of camera range toward the audience, and the door, less than 2 minutes after the hearing started.

Forty-five minutes later the video picks back up with the court clerk calling, “The State recalls Michael Hunt.”

The judge asks Miron to get her client but less than a minute later her voice can be heard from beyond camera range, “It appears Mr. Hunt has vacated the courthouse.”

The judge immediately ruled that Hunt had failed to appear by leaving early and ordered him held without bond, making Hunt a wanted man. The search that ensued turned into an all-out manhunt three days later when four people were gunned down Thursday night in an Allen Avenue home.

Panama City police quickly declared Hunt a “person of interest” in the case and he was located the following evening and taken into custody for failure to appear, but he has not been charged in connection with the shootings.

Police have not said if they think the shootings are related to any of the previous or pending charges against Hunt or why he is a “person of interest” in the case. The scene of the crime remained roped off with crime scene tape Wednesday. In addition to the earlier charges, Hunt, now being held without bond, is facing new charges of human trafficking, living off the earnings of a prostitute and sexual battery no physical force by offender 18 or older, victim greater than 12 years of age/less than 18 years of age.

Hunt previously served prison time from April 3, 2013, until June 1, 2015, for three drug charges — including trafficking — as well as grand theft and living off the earnings of a prostitute, according to Florida Department of Corrections records. Those records also indicate Hunt “qualified” for sexual offender status for a 1990 conviction for “US MILITARY (RAPE) GCMO 16 Us Army, NJ.”

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Sexual Offenders and Predators Search website shows that on Jan. 3, Hunt registered his address as being 2119 E. Fifth St., which is the address for Polecats, a business that advertises on social media as a “Dance Studio & VIP Event Venue.” On social media it appears to have a warehouse-type interior that includes a small stage and dance pole.

According to the Florida Department of State, Division of Corporations, Hunt is listed as the registered agent and manager of POLECATS LLC.

And according to the Bay County Property Appraiser’s Office, that property is owned by 6316 E INDEPENDENCE BLVD, LLC., which, in turn, according to the Division of Corporations, lists its title manager as George Kingston, who owns a number of other properties downtown and in Panama City.

706,Man guilty of attempted murder in shooting outside Ocala bar,"Steven Caro, 32, will be sentenced on May 23

Jurors on Friday found a man guilty of attempted second-degree murder in the shooting of a former U.S. Coast Guard member.

The six-member jury, all women, began deliberating at 11:38 a.m. and by 12:51 p.m. had reached a verdict. Seven minutes later, Circuit Judge Steven Rogers, who presided over the two-day trial, reviewed the verdict before giving it to the clerk to read aloud.

At the conclusion, the defendant, Steven Caro, 32, removed the gold chain from around his neck and gave it to his lawyer, James Tarquin.

Rogers scheduled sentencing for 2:30 p.m. May 23.

Before leaving the courtroom in handcuffs, Caro wanted to make a statement. Rogers told him he will have time to say something, and cautioned him to talk with his attorney first before saying anything.

But Caro insisted. He asked if the verdict could be appealed. Rogers told him Tarquin will explain the procedures to him. Caro also asked for a phone call.

Tarquin told the Star-Banner: ""We all did our jobs.""

Prosecutors Shaw Ashley and Cindy Harper spoke to the family of the victim, Jarel Rhem, who was a member of the U.S. Coast Guard. The prosecutors declined comment to the Star-Banner.

Rhem's father, Frank, said: ""We thank God for saving our son and we're pleased that justice was served.""

Rhem's mother, Kathleen, said: ""I'm happy we have our son."" She said while she's sorry for Caro's family, she's glad for the verdict because Caro won't hurt anyone else.

Earlier Friday, jurors listened intently during closing arguments as Harper told them that Caro was the man who shot and almost killed Rhem, now 24.

Harper said Caro was at Tavern on the Square, 11 E. Silver Springs Blvd., one night in May 2017 and bumped into Rhem on the dance floor. She said Rhem's friend, Yuan Carlos Huertas, intervened and separated the men.

She said Caro, who was wearing a distinctive red hat, ""stared them (Rhem and Huertas) down."" From there, Harper said, there were complaints made about Caro and his attitude.

When the club closed, she said, Rhem and Caro were face to face outside and Caro whispered something. As Rhem leaned in, there was a shot and Caro ran, getting into his vehicle and driving away.

""He shot that bullet into Jarel Rhem's stomach,"" Harper said.

Harper played an interview Caro gave to Ocala police Detective Jeff Hurst. At the time, the men, along with other detectives, were in a car on their way to the police department. Caro had been arrested for attempted second-degree murder.

In the interview, Caro talks about being at the club and having a brief confrontation with Rhem. He said he went outside and pulled out his knife. When he heard a shot he ran away. After that interview, Harper told the jury, other witnesses, including Huertas, identified Caro as the shooter.

During his closing argument, Tarquin said witnesses presented by the state gave conflicting testimony. The statements, he said, were different from what they said during depositions. That, he argues, ""shows reasonable doubt.""

Tarquin said that while he understands the difficultly of police work, in his estimation, their investigation was poor. He said police lost a photo lineup that was shown to one of the witnesses. Also, they did not record some of the witness statements and failed to send some evidence to be tested by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

""They didn't do their jobs,"" Tarquin said.

Tarquin noted that Rhem picked someone other than Caro from a photo lineup. The lawyer was skeptical of his client's statements to Hurst, and told the jury to ""view it cautiously.""

In her counter-argument, Harper said Caro's statements to Hurst should prove he was at the scene and that he shot the victim. As for the photo lineup shown to Rhem: She said he was in the hospital at the time, under medication, and could not speak. She said Huertas did pick Caro from a photo lineup shown to him.

Each side was given an hour to make their closing arguments. The prosecution went first, followed by the defense and then the prosecutors' rebuttal.

Rogers read prepared jury instructions to the jurors and they left the courtroom for lunch and deliberations.

At the start of Friday's proceedings, Tarquin began the defense by calling several people to the witness stand. Caro chose not to testify.

707,Here they are: 4 Ocala-area grads never missed a day,"Perfect attendance for 13 years

Through it all, from flu season to family emergencies, four Marion County seniors had perfect attendance for all 13 years of school.

Three Forest High School students and one from North Marion High School were honored by the School District for attending all 2,340 days of school from kindergarten through 12th grade.

The only time the students missed school was when the district canceled school for all students for a few days during hurricane seasons.

All four students graduate May 18 with the highest attendance rate in the district for the Class of 2019. Forest’s graduation is at 9 a.m. and North Marion High School’s is at 7 p.m. Both ceremonies wil be held at the Southeastern Livestock Pavilion on Old Jacksonville Road.

“That is awesome,” said Eric Cummings, the School Board’s vice chairman. “That means these children have fantastic family support.”

Board member Nancy Thrower was in awe of the accomplishment.

“That’s some kind of dedication,” she noted. “If they continue with that kind of commitment they will not have any problems with their next steps in life.”

Last year, just one student in the district reached this milestone.

Some compare the accomplishment of these four students to Cal Ripken Jr. of Major League Baseball. Ripken broke Lou Gehrig’s record of consecutive games played. Ripken, known by the nickname the “Iron Man,” played 2,632 consecutive games. That is the equivalent of more than 16 seasons without missing a game.

Marion’s “Iron Women,” listed in alphabetical order, are:

Hannah Farrow

Hannah started kindergarten in 2006 at Maplewood Elementary and continued to Howard Middle School and Forest.

She plans to continue her education at the College of Central Florida. Hannah is the daughter of Wayne and Kim Farrow of Ocala.

Amber Hanegan

Amber enrolled as a kindergarten student in 2006 at Reddick-Collier Elementary and advanced to North Marion Middle School and North Marion High.

She is considering studying business administration at Santa Fe College. Amber is the daughter of Christina Hanegan of Reddick.

Wasanti Sharma

Wasanti started kindergarten in 2006 at Madison Street Academy and advanced to Howard Middle School and Forest.

She plans to attend the University of Florida with an undeclared major. Wasanti is the daughter of Prem and Tommie Sharma of Ocala.

Jaylin Tomlin

Jaylin entered kindergarten at Maplewood Elementary in 2006 and continued to Shady Hill Elementary, Liberty Middle School and Forest.

708,"After addiction and loss, Seminole mother finds strength in family, customs and herself","Every time Dakota Osceola hit rock bottom, she had the will to get back up and a mom who stood by her with outstretched hands — no judgment, no shaming, no ultimatums.

Through years of Dakota’s drug addiction, rehab treatments, depression, the overdose deaths of her friends, relapses and unhealthy relationships, Tina Marie Osceola was there — a stable, determined force of tough love and support for her daughter regardless of the circumstances and decisions that led her girl down an agonizing path.

“There was no playbook to go by, other than the way I was raised by my own parents,” Osceola said. “I wanted Dakota to know that I would always be there, regardless of what the problem was. If your kid feels like you’re judging them, they’re going to think you think they’re a bad person. And they’re not going to come to you. They’re going to shut you out.”

Dakota Osceola and her daughter, Mia, walk down the driveway of their home in Naples on May 3, 2019. Many members of their family, including Dakota's mother, brother, and grandparents, live on the same street as Dakota and Mia. ""We have everything we need, and that's each other,"" she said. ""We're trying to be financially independent, trying our best to work as hard as we can to accomplish our goals, and that's really what it's been about since the beginning of the Osceolas."" (Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Osceola said she had to check herself frequently when figuring out how to help her daughter and how involved to get in Dakota’s life during her difficult periods.

In Osceola’s experience, giving tough love sometimes meant letting Dakota sit in jail when she was arrested, taking her to rehab centers again and again, telling her daughter what she needed to hear and letting her make her own mistakes while remaining vigilant.

Osceola said she’s a problem solver and a fixer. But she knew she couldn’t fix her daughter’s problems for her no matter how much she wanted to.

“It’s letting them fall,” Osceola said. “It’s the hardest thing a parent can do. But if you don’t let them hit their own version of rock bottom and let them get back up themselves, they’re not going to find that road to recovery.”

She left an abusive relationship and is a single mom to her 2-year-old daughter, Mia. She has become actively involved in her family’s Seminole culture, including causes related to indigenous women’s issues. She raises awareness about violence against women and raises money for the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center.

Dakota started a business selling traditional Seminole jewelry. She spends hours every day buried in beads, creating necklaces, bracelets and earrings in intricate color patterns. Dakota and her mom, who also beads, sell their creations on Seminole and Miccosukee reservations in South Florida and beyond.

“I’m really proud. It saved my life,” Dakota said of beading.

History of drug use

Dakota said she started partying and skipping class in high school. She said she started smoking marijuana when she was 16 years old. She eventually moved on to hallucinogens. Then Xanax.

“That was my first time getting to the point where I wasn’t remembering giant blocks of time,” she said.

In 2012, when Dakota was 18, Collier County Sheriff’s deputies arrested her at her mom’s house on charges of possession of alcohol by a minor, marijuana and drug paraphernalia. She was arrested again soon after being released from the Collier jail on another marijuana possession charge.

Osceola was out of town a lot because of her job with the Seminole Tribe of Florida. She’s currently a tribal judge and worked at the Sheriff’s Office from 1995 to 2004.

Osceola said it felt like she blinked and things changed with her daughter. She can’t remember when the transition happened.

“I was on the road a lot, and so I think that’s why it seemed like it happened so fast…,” she said.

Dakota’s drug use became an emergency for Osceola, and she wanted it to be everybody else’s emergency, too. When Osceola needed help for herself and her daughter, she turned to her tribe and her former coworkers at the Sheriff’s Office. They became her extended support network. She reached out to whatever resources she could find.

“I didn’t care if they arrested her. That was fine,” Osceola said. “Jail, institutions or death, and I’ll choose jail. I’ll choose an institution for my daughter. Who wants to choose death?”

Dakota was always open about her struggles, her mom said. She’s unapologetically herself and was brutally honest about her addiction. It was never a secret, but it was still difficult for Osceola to accept.

“I’m the one who had to tell myself the truth about what was really going on most of the time,” Osceola said. “I had to be brave enough to start asking questions. And that’s not easy when you know your child will tell you the truth. That’s the ground floor of denial, not knowing and not being brave enough to even ask the questions.”

Dakota’s first rehab treatment began days after her 2012 arrest. She stayed at a treatment center for about 100 days, she said.

“It gave me a dose of independence and really showed me what life could be,” Dakota said.

Her sobriety didn’t last long when she got back home. She had more rehab stints between 2013 and 2015. A series of traumatic losses compounded her struggle.

One friend died in a motorcycle crash. Others died of overdoses. A guy she was dating died of an overdose in March 2015, one day after the pair went looking for apartments to move into together.

“ … My drug use went off the charts after that happened,” Dakota said. “I was self-medicating not to feel that pain.”

Dakota’s mom took her to a rehab center in Tampa three days later.

“After that I was like, you know what? This is the reality of it: You can either die, go to jail, or be institutionalized for the rest of your life because you did some pretty bad harm to yourself,” Dakota said. “I didn’t take it seriously before that.”

Beading, beading, beading

Dakota believes beautiful things can come from terrible situations.

Everything she has gone through, she said, was meant to happen to bring better things into her life. She feels that way about her beadwork and her daughter.

In 2015, during one of their weekly phone calls when she was at the Tampa center, Dakota asked her mom to bring her plastic bin full of beads.

Osceola visited a bead store in Naples and bought pliers and wire. She stuffed Dakota’s bead bin with everything she would need and delivered it to her.

Dakota grew up in a house full of beads. When she was little, she sat in her family’s booths at various reservations while they sold their art.

Her mom has had a massive collection since she was a kid, and when Dakota was about 5 years old, she started collecting her own.

Osceola grew up in Naples but lived within her tribal culture. Her life was all about her family and the traditional art they made and sold so they could pay the bills. Her aunts and cousins sew Seminole patchwork “like no one’s business,” and her dad makes jewelry. Osceola learned how to weave baskets, make dolls and sew, though she said she was a failure as a seamstress. Osceola and her dad also have a beading business together.

“Beading was my thing,” Osceola said.

(Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

And it’s become her daughter’s thing. Making traditional art for survival took on a different meaning for Dakota. She didn’t need to make jewelry to support a family, pay bills or put herself through school; she needed it to work through her struggles.

The day Dakota picked up her beads at the rehab facility became her first day of healing.

“I was like: Wow, I really love this. This is what’s gonna keep me sober,” Dakota said. “This is what’s gonna keep me clean. This is what’s gonna give me purpose.”

Dakota began thriving. She made jewelry for her friends in rehab and taught some of them how to bead. When she left the center, she got a booth at a market in Ybor City near downtown Tampa and sold countless pieces.

“You know, that independence and the ability to set goals for herself, and to know that she did it and it was 100 percent her effort … that did more than anything toward her sobriety,” Osceola said.

Finding peace

Dakota had another major obstacle to overcome before she found her peace.

She said she was in an abusive relationship with her daughter’s father. Dakota said he was physically abusive before she became pregnant and he didn’t stop after. The man was arrested on a domestic battery charge in late 2015 after hitting Dakota in the face, court records show.

Dakota said she was on the phone with her mom when her ex hit her, and she told her mom what happened.

Looking back on that day, Dakota’s mom said her daughter’s life sometimes felt like she was walking back through some of her own experiences.

“I had to get past an emotional reaction and wanting to be the mom that picks up a stick, goes out and beats the crap out of somebody to rational thought,” Osceola said.

She had to think to herself: What tools have I learned along the way?

Osceola said she experienced a years-long abusive relationship when she was in college. She said she thought the abuse was her fault at the time, that she must have done something to deserve it. She stayed for five years, and it was five years too long, she said.

Osceola knows her daughter. She knows telling Dakota what to do doesn’t work, because being told what to do didn’t work for Osceola, either. Osceola checked herself again.

She believed in allowing her daughter to make her own mistakes before. To reach rock bottom so she could get back up. But Dakota had only been in recovery for a few months. She wasn’t on solid ground just yet.

“I knew this was something that could push her over the edge,” Osceola said.

This was not a rock bottom she would let her daughter reach.

Osceola put her foot down in her own way. She told Dakota she couldn’t let the man do that to her and asked her daughter to let her call the Sheriff’s Office.

The man was arrested. He was adjudicated guilty in 2016 and sentenced to a year in the county jail with credit for time served, followed by three years of state probation.

Dakota said she tried to work things out with him when he was released from the jail. She knew immediately it wouldn’t work out. She said she thinks he would have become violent again.

“I didn’t want that around my child,” she said.

Dakota moved back to Naples after the incident. She had her family’s support throughout her pregnancy and in the two years since she had Mia.

Dakota said she now feels like she’s in a good place — in her home, her work and motherhood.

“My daughter’s happy,” Dakota said. “She loves this space, she loves our house, she loves coming home. And that’s where I wanna be. This is where I’m happy.”

It takes a tribe

Dakota said her mom and grandparents have given her everything she needs emotionally and mentally.

She and her mom get their strength from their family, their culture and their moments of darkness.

When Dakota was using drugs, and even when she wasn’t, her mom was always there to pick her up and come up with solutions to whatever she was going through. Her grandma was there to make her feel warm and loved. Her grandma made her feel like she was something special.

Dakota and her mom said they also derive their strength from what it means to be indigenous women: community-oriented, strong, loving, accepting. Warriors.

Since Dakota started selling her jewelry on reservations, she has opened herself up to people and made lasting friendships with other indigenous women. They support each other’s businesses and talk about their traditional arts and preserving culture.

“We all try to empower each other,” Dakota said. “We show up for each other and have our own economy.”

The strength, rich culture and power that Dakota’s family has passed on to her is something she wants to pass on to Mia.

Dakota’s mom was driven to work, be financially independent, support her family and be involved in tribal issues locally and nationally. Now Dakota is at a stage in which she values her business, financial independence, providing for her daughter and being involved in her community.

Everything the Osceolas do they do together, for each other, and with the help of their family.

She’s raising Mia with a secure, united family. Dakota likes to say her mom is a badass, and that she’s lucky to be a mom to a little girl she knows is going to turn out the same way.

“I want Mia to be unapologetically herself, no matter how weird or silly that may be,” Dakota said. “To treat people how she wants to be treated and never settle for anybody less than what her family can provide for her.”

Dakota has a lot of hope — for her daughter, herself, her business, her future.

That hope came from surviving her addictions and finding her power through family background. She said she has lost the desire to use drugs. While she feels like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders, she works on herself and her mental health regularly and makes sure she maintains a healthy, balanced lifestyle.

(Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Dakota’s mom said addiction runs in their family. And substance abuse issues affect indigenous populations in general. Osceola has worried about history repeating itself, but she believes in Dakota and her commitment to her sobriety.

“I think a lot of people in our society look at addiction as a weakness instead of a source of strength,” Osceola said. “That’s not our weakness. The battles native people have gone through, it’s not our weakness. It’s our strength that we survived.”

During that final stint in rehab, Dakota willed herself to get back up. Her survival is inextricably linked to the strength she gets from her family.

“We have everything we need, and that’s each other,” Dakota said.

INDIANTOWN — An Indiantown man is accused of sexually battering a 5-year-old girl multiple times and molesting a 13-year-old girl, sheriff's deputies said.

Hermenegildo Salvador-Lopez, 27, of the 14500 block of Southwest Martin Avenue in Indiantown, was charged Thursday with sexually battering the 5-year-old.

Salvador-Lopez was already in the Martin County Jail prior to Thursday's charge. He was arrested in April on a charge of lewd and lascivious molestation on a child younger than 16 from an incident that happened in October, deputies said.

Martin County sheriff's deputies said in April the girl, who is now 16, told deputies Salvador-Lopez had touched her inappropriately multiple times when she was younger.

""It's something that I have to live with,"" the girl told deputies when talking about what Salvador-Lopez had done.

The 16-year-old also told deputies the touching continued until she was 12. At that time, she kicked him and threatened to tell her mother.

The 16-year-old told deputies Salvador-Lopez told her no one would believe her and that God would blame her for letting this happen.

The other teen told deputies Salvador-Lopez touched her inappropriately and refused to stop when she asked him.

Salvador-Lopez remained in the Martin County Jail with a $550,500 bond.

711,Swan City showcases City Beautiful through T-shirts,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Swan City is letting the world know there is more to Orlando than just theme parks and tourism.

The online apparel store features Orlando-inspired designs, showcasing some of the local hidden gems the City Beautiful has to offer. A Central Florida man is using his T-shirts as a creative way to display what Orlando really has to offer.

""I love this place. I don't think I'll ever leave now,"" Andrew Chang, founder of Swan City said.

But the 30-year-old didn’t always feel this way.

""Coming here, I thought this wasn't a big city. I thought this wasn't big enough for me. I didn't think there was enough things to do,"" Chang said.

In 2008, he moved from his hometown, Titusville, to go to school at the University of Central Florida. A year later, he met his husband.

Together, they started to venture out into hot spots in Orlando and realized all the things it has to offer -- away from the tourism.

""We started getting things like the soccer stadium and the performing arts center and a lot more growth and development in the downtown area,"" Chang said.

The entrepreneur said those changes in the city started to give Orlando a different identity -- one he wanted everyone to experience -- so he created Swan City.

The online apparel store is where he honors the City Beautiful through T-shirts with a touch of his humor. Some of the shirts depict a well-known building that can be see from a popular highway, one locals call part of Orlando’s landscape.

""If anyone recognizes the building, we know it in Orlando as the I-4 eyesore,” he said. “It's taken, I think, 17 years to get to where it's at.”

Also showcased is a popular pizza restaurant, Lazy Moon. It’s a staple of the UCF community.

""Going to UCF, this is a very popular place back then -- and now since then, they've moved to downtown so it will workout for Lazy Moon,” Chang said. “If anyone knows about Lazy Moon, the slice is about the size of your face.”.

The company also pays tribute to the city's sports teams. Featuring designs on candles and posters, too.

It's places like the Milk District in east Orlando, Pom Pom's Teahouse and Sandwicheria or the Lake Eola and Thornton Park neighborhoods that Chang hopes outsiders will learn to love just as much as he does.

712,Clearwater police seek well-dressed wallet snatcher,"CLEARWATER, Fla. (WFLA) - Clearwater police are searching for a well-dressed crook who plucked a woman's wallet out of her purse while she was picking produce.

The department released video of the caper on its Facebook page.

It happened on April 28 at the Whole Foods store in the Westfield Countryside Mall in Clearwater.

Police spokesman Rob Shaw says the video shows the man walking around the produce section of the store. He then spots the woman.

""He's shopping around the produce area but he does seem to keep an eye on this woman, he probably notices she has a purse in the front part of the cart,"" said Shaw.

""And that she's occasionally picking out different items of produce there.""

The man swipes the wallet and quickly exits the store.

Police say he then made his way south to the Best Buy store on Drew Street and U.S. 19 where he attempted to purchase thousands of dollars in items.

It didn't work.

The victim didn't realize she's been ripped off until she went to check out at the Whole Foods and discovered her wallet was gone.

Police are hoping someone recognizes the man and turns him in.

In the meantime, they are warning women to keep an eye on their valuables, even in stores where they believe they won't be targeted.

""And I've talked to some of our female detectives asking what do you do? Some have talked about how they would loop their purse strap around the cart and maybe turn it upside down,"" said Shaw.

""Just, not make it easy for the criminal.""

713,Man's dying wish is to find forever homes for 11 rescue dogs,"A Texas man who doesn’t have long to live has one last wish before he dies: to find loving forever homes for nearly a dozen dogs he’s taken in over the years.

Richard Ewers, 71, is living out his remaining days in hospice care since he was given a week to live after being diagnosed with cancer, according to San Antonio’s KSAT-TV.

Two years ago, Ewers began rescuing strays and other dogs that had been discarded by their owners, and taking care of them at his home, the television station reports.

Even before his diagnosis, Ewers couldn’t do it alone. So volunteers have pitched in by getting the dogs vaccinated, spayed and neutered, and helping to find them new homes.

Now that the 71-year-old is in hospice, Save Our Strays San Antonio has been visiting his home to make sure the dogs are well fed, watered and looked after in Ewers’ absence.

“There’s no one to give them attention and love. There is no running water. There is no electricity. The conditions are just not ideal,” volunteer Mary Oyler told KSAT.

Oyler said Ewers’ dying wish is to make sure each of the remaining 11 dogs is placed into a new home where they can get all the love and care they need to thrive.

“There's a lot of work involved,” Oyler said. “All they've ever known is Mr. Richard, so it's going to require a family that has a lot of patience.”

Anyone interested in adopting one of the dogs – whose names include Billie Sue, Fuzzy, Lady, Lucky, Sugar and Skipper, to name a few – can visit the Facebook page Helping Mr. Richard and his dogs.

“We are very sad by this, of course, and we want to make that last wish come true for him,” Oyler said.

714,Starbucks' past incidents of racial discrimination makes its way to Brandon,"MORE ABOUT THE LAWSUIT Man claims he was harassed by Starbucks employees in Brandon

TAMPA, Fla. - A new lawsuit has been filed against a Brandon Starbucks, citing racial discrimination, but it's not the first time the coffee giant has been in hot water.

Last year, two African-American men were arrested for tresspassing while waiting for a friend at a Starbucks in downtown Philadelphia, after an employee refused to allow him to use the restroom, saying it was for paying customers only.

Days later, another viral video surfaced showing an African-American man in the Los Angeles area trying to show that he was denied use of a Starbucks restroom while a white customer was allowed access.

The series of incidents prompted Starbucks to show its 175,000 employees a film about racial bias to lead into a full curriculum on the topic.

In May of 2018, more than 8,000 Starbucks locations, including more than 20 in Hillsborough County, closed for training on the subject of racial bias.

Starbucks later update it's policies, saying anyone could sit in its cafes or use its restrooms, even if they didn't buy anything.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Florida law protects anyone from discrimination based on virtually any personal factors:

""All persons are entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, handicap, familial status, or religion.""

While most lawsuits pertaining to race discrimination stem from employment or racial bias in the workplace, Florida has had seven major lawsuits involving racial discrimnation in the laws ten years ranging from everything to stop-and-frisk situations in Miami to violating the rights of minority voters.

Section 2000a of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race by restaurants, hotels, theaters, gas stations, and in contracting.",https://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/starbucks-has-a-history-of-racial-discrimination-/1989140293,2019-05-08T17:48:24Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
715,"Pensacola suspect in toddler 'torture' case has died, officials say","A Pensacola man accused of inflicting ""systematic torture"" on a toddler is deceased, according to officials.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, passed away in the hospital Tuesday afternoon, according to an Escambia County spokesperson. He was hospitalized May 1, the same day the Escambia County Sheriff's Office announced Celaius was charged with committing ""heinous"" acts of abuse against his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter.

Celaius was in custody at Escambia County Jail at the time he was hospitalized. County officials, citing patient privacy laws, have declined to discuss what caused his hospitalization and his subsequent death.

Celaius was initially booked into Escambia County Jail April 9 on drug charges, but on May 1, the Escambia County Sheriff's Office announced Celaius was facing new charges related to child abuse.

His arrest report alleges that Celaius had routinely abused the child over a two months span by throwing objects at her as she slept, shooting her in the head repeatedly with a BB gun and jolting her with an electric dog collar. He allegedly recorded the device on home surveillance cameras and personal cell phones.

According to an arrest report, a forensic exam of the victim raised concerns that she may have been sexually abused as well.

Jail personnel moved Celaius into protective custody immediately after the press conference announcing his child abuse charges, but a few hours later he was transported to a local hospital. County officials said he remained in the hospital until his death Tuesday.

A county spokesperson said the incident was being investigated both internally by the county and externally by the Escambia County Sheriff's Office.

This is a developing story. More information will be provided as it becomes available.

AdventHealth Waterman staff declared 27-year old Sean Christopher Bentley dead shortly before noon Wednesday. The Lake County Sheriff's Office said he was taken there after suffering an undisclosed medical emergency and passing out as he was being treated by EMS.

Deputies were pursuing Bentley on a warrant for failing to appear in court for previous charges of eluding law enforcement.

The deputy attempted to pull Bentley out of the car after using his taser, but Bentley reportedly put the car in drive and dragged the deputy some distance, injuring his leg.

Not long later, he crashed his car on County Road 437 and allegedly attempted to flee on foot. Deputies apprehended him in the Eagle Dunes subdivision in Sorrento. After he was subdued, Bentley began experiencing medical problems and EMS was called. He was aggressive towards EMS personnel until passing out, authorities said.

717,WATCH: Snake bites Oklahoma man in face,"Photo credit: Mashawn Copeland Photo credit: Mashawn Copeland

- A doorbell camera captured the moment a snake lunged at a man, biting him in the face.

Mashawn Copeland tells Fox 35 he was at his father's house in Lawton, Oklahoma when the attack happened.

In the video, Copeland is seen walking up to the front door, not knowing that there was a creature waiting for him.

As he opens the door, a snake, which was wrapped around the porch light fixture, suddenly lashes out, biting Copeland on the side of his face, just missing his eye!

He immediately went to the hospital to be treated.

Copeland posted the video of the terrifying encounter to Facebook.

""When you think things arent going right... Just be thankful a snake didnt bite you in the face today 🙏🏾.""

Copeland believes it was a 5-foot bullsnake that bit him.

720,Man accused of making threatening anti-Semitic calls to bagel shop,"MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - A Miami man was arrested Tuesday after police said he made threatening phone calls to a Miami Beach bagel shop, targeting the business because its owners were Jewish.

Jorge Mateo Rucinque, 26, faces a charge of making threatening phone calls.

According to the arrest report, Rucinque made several calls on Monday to Bagel Time Cafe in the 3900 block of Alton Road. In one of the calls, Rucinque told the owner's wife that he would ""explode the Jewish community,"" the report said.

After his arrest by the Miami Beach Police Department's Intelligence Unit, Rucinque told officers that he sought out Jewish businesses by searching the internet for key words such ""Jews"" and ""kosher,"" the report said. Rucinque works as an Uber driver.

According to the police report, Rucinque did not posses any weapons when he was arrested at his home.

Yehoshua Nodel, the owner of the cafe, told Local 10's Andrew Perez that Rucinque basically told his wife that Jews were taking over the world.

""(He said,) 'We're going to make sure you can't overpopulate like you are now and we're going to get rid of you,' basically,"" Nodel said. ""'I'm here. That's my mission.'""

Nodel said he alerted police after the calls, especially in light of recent deadly attacks on synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, California.

""This thing could happen in any of our businesses all around Miami,"" Nodel said. ""Personally, I wouldn't get a gun permit until today, but now I'm rethinking it, you know? Maybe it's something I should have.""

725,"Naples Zoo celebrates 50th year as a zoo, 100th year as a garden","In Naples, 100th birthdays aren't necessarily uncommon, but they're none the less a cause for celebration, which is exactly what the Naples Zoo is doing as it marks its 100th year as a botanical garden and 50th year as a zoo.

The zoo is hosting a birthday party Saturday for Dr. Henry Nehrling, the man without whom the zoo might not exist today.

Two men with a vision (and green thumbs)

Nehrling, a botanist from Wisconsin, moved to Central Florida in the early 1900s to study and collect tropical plants. A freeze devastated his garden in 1917, so in 1919 he moved further south to Naples and purchased 13 acres along the Gordon River.

This year the Naples Zoo is celebrating 100 years as a botanical garden and 50 years as a zoo. (Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

His work thrived there and by 1925 Nehrling's collection had more than 3,000 species of tropical plants. He also helped introduce more than 300 new and beneficial plants to the United States.

Nehrling died in 1929 and for the next two decades his garden went unattended, said Tim Tetzlaff, the zoo's director of conservation.

""Basically nobody was keeping watch, nobody was paying attention, so there was a fair amount of botanical vandalism and stealing. Things that were either small enough or still in pots at the time kind of vanished,"" he said. ""That’s why we’ve got dozens of historic specimens, not thousands from that era.""

Julius Fleischmann, Jr., a philanthropist from Cincinnati, came to town in 1946 ""with his checkbook and a vision,"" Tetzlaff said. He bought Nehrling's property in 1951 and not only restored the garden to its former glory, but also expanded it.

""He added 30 more acres and also hundreds of species of birds,"" said Elaine Reed, president of Naples Historical Society. ""At one point he actually had 1,200 different species of birds.""

Fleischmann renamed the property ""Caribbean Gardens,"" a name it still bears today, and opened it to guests in 1954. Three years later he installed the famed toucan sign on U.S. 41 that welcomed visitors to the garden a few blocks away on Goodlette-Frank Road.

Fleischmann owned and operated the property until his death in 1968. A year later, the land fell into a new set of hands that would once again transform it forever.

Lawrence and Nancy Jane Tetzlaff, better known as Jungle Larry and Safari Jane, were well-known expedition leaders and zoo operators in the Midwest.

The couple visited Naples in 1967 and fell in love with Caribbean Gardens. They inquired about purchasing the property, but Fleischmann refused to sell.

Shortly after Fleischmann's death, his son, who had inherited the property, offered to lease it to the Tetzlaffs and they immediately agreed.

CLOSE Janet and Jean, two endangered clouded leopard kittens, were born at the Naples Zoo on Feb. 22, 2018. Lisa Conley, lisa.conley@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5308

Work began to incorporate the Tetzlaffs' animals into the garden while preserving as much of the botanical garden as possible.

""All the original animal exhibits were put in with the removal of just one tree,"" said Tim Tetzlaff, Larry and Jane's son. ""That way it maintained the nature of what was then a 50-year-old botanical garden.""

The Tetzlaffs owned and operated the zoo until 2002 when the Fleischmann family expressed an interest in selling the 43 acres of zoo property and the nearly 120 surrounding acres.

Knowing that a buyer would most likely bulldoze the area, the Tetzlaffs asked Collier County to buy the land. In a 2004 referendum, Collier County voters overwhelming agreed to tax themselves to buy the zoo from the Fleischmann family.

Preserving the past and looking to the future

Today the zoo's staff is working to preserve the property's history and ensure that it will be around for the next 100 years.

""The most unique thing about this property is this is as close as you could get to what Naples would have looked like a long time ago,"" said Danielle Green, the zoo's director of gardens and grounds.

""I think it’s very unique in this day and age, no matter where you are in the country, that you’re able to go and visit a place on a regular basis and see plants that your great-great-grandmother would have seen at the time. I think that’s really special.""

Making a Difference: Naples Zoo striving to be a conservation leader

Green and her team care for the hundreds of plants and trees on the property, including eight Nehrling and 11 Fleischmann historic tree specimens.

“Older specimens require a little additional care, no different than that of humans or animals, so we try to pay special attention to them versus some of the younger ones,"" Green said.

Sometimes that additional care means injecting pesticides directly into the tree, said Darryl Windham, the zoo's horticultural manager.

“Some of these trees are so large when you’re trying to do pest control or even fertilizer you can’t just spray the trees,"" he said. ""It’s just not feasible and very impractical to do that.""

In addition to preserving the property's history, the zoo is also working on expansion plans.

The Naples Zoo launched a $25 million fundraising campaign in 2016 to add a flamingo/roseate spoonbill exhibit, Alligator Bay feature, Komodo dragon exhibit, South American rain forest and grasslands trail, nature and water play area for children, and education center, which will be used to host camps and programs for students from Collier and Lee counties and night lectures for adults.

The zoo is also adding a new on-site animal hospital set to be complete in July, a welcome center and a revamped entrance that will remind visitors of the zoo's long history.

“The new entrance has an Old Florida theme, so it will recreate the entrance sign that was on U.S. 41 for all those years with the big toucan we have preserved,"" Tetzlaff said. ""So we’re connecting people with the past, but also with everything that’s new inside.""

726,Family sues Lake County sheriff after deadly crash,"LAKE COUNTY, Fla. - A local family is suing the Sheriff of Lake County after their son was killed during a high-speed chase.



Yadira Santiago and Carlos Sanchez filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Lake County Sheriff Peyton Grinnell after their son was killed in a deadly crash that followed a chase.

The chase violated the department's policy, and according to the lawsuit, a high ranking sheriff's office employee is to blame.

""Its been very hard."" Santiago said. ""It changed our lives.""

The lawsuit claims a sheriff's deputy's negligence led to the wrongful death of 19-year-old Carlos Sanchez-Santiago.

""Your kids are supposed to bury you, not the other way around,"" Santiago said.

In April 2017, Sanchez-Santiago was driving home from work at Universal Studios as Lake County deputies tried to pull over a driver who had run a red light.

A camera from a deputy's cruiser captured what happened next.

According to reports, the driver, 23-year-old Wilvenson Darius, didn't stop and deputies chased him.

The chase went for miles around Lake County and one deputy admitted traveling 130 mph, according to reports obtained by News 6.

Minutes later, as Darius crossed the county line leaving Lake County and entering Orange County, deputies say he lost control, and crashed head-on into Sanchez-Santiago's car.

""Why chase?"" Sanchez said. ""I'm not happy and the system is not good,"" he said.

The lawsuit alleges Deputy Joshua Creech violated the chase policy of the defendant in the lawsuit. Dashcam video and radio communications later revealed Creech lied about what happened.

Before the crash Creech followed the driver to a dead-end road. That's when Creech reports the driver tried to hit him.

""He just tried to hit me head on,"" Creech can be heard saying in radio transmissions.

But the dashcam video shows Darius' mustang driving past as Creech walks toward it.

""The dashcam video contradicts Creech's statement,"" according to an Internal Affairs Report obtained by News 6 .

But that statement kicked the chase into high gear, because Lake County policy does allow deputies to pursue suspects accused of forcible felonies.

""I blame the police,"" Sanchez told News 6.

""They don't have to do that for minor infractions,"" Santiago said.

""As a direct and proximate result of the negligence of Lake County Deputy Joshua Creech, and vicarious negligence of Defendant Peyton C. Grinnell, Carlos Sanchez Santiago suffered death,"" the lawsuit alleges.

""Nothing that happens in this world is going to bring him back, so I would like justice so it doesn't happen to anybody else,"" Santiago said.

The man who was running from deputies, Darius was convicted of vehicular homicide and sentenced in December to 20 years in prison, plus 10 years of probation.

Grinnell filed a response to the lawsuit saying he and his deputies are not liable for the crash that killed Sanchez-Santiago.

""Darius' actions of violating traffic laws and felony fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer were the sole cause of subject accident,"" according to the sheriff's response.

Creech is still employed at the Lake County Sheriff's Office. After the Internal Affairs investigation he lost 10 vacation days as punishment.

727,"Jabar Gaffney breaks his silence about vandalism case, other allegations","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Facing a felony charge in the vandalism of his former teammate's car and lingering accusations of bad behavior, Derrick ""Jabar"" Gaffney is going on the record -- saying he's been silent long enough and wants to set the record straight.

For the first time in years, the former football player says it's time to explain who he is and why he believes he is misunderstood.

Sitting in a conference room on the second floor of News4Jax studios, calm and focused, Gaffney told his side to the I-TEAM about accusations that have been made against him, his faith in God and family, and the game of football.

Jenese Harris: Do you remember the first time you picked up a football?

Jabar Gaffney: Yes, 2 years old. That was a gift that my mom and dad gave me, and I just ran with it.

Gaffney's talent is not just his own; it's embedded in his DNA. His father, Derrick, uncles Don, Warren and Johnny all played football, too.

His fans will say he was quick on his feet and with his hands as a football player for Raines High School in the 1997 state championship.

""I was a member of the '97 State team, got to catch the game winning touchdown in that game, and we were the first public school to win one,"" Gaffney said.

He got the attention of recruiters, but he stayed close to home and played as a wide receiver for the University of Florida before leaving after two years for a career in the NFL.

Accused of theft at UF

At times, his success on the field became a secondary headline. While at UF, Gaffney was accused of stealing $240 and a watch from Florida Field's locker room. He was dropped from the team.

Gaffney signed a deferred prosecution agreement for felony petty theft that included restitution, and the charges were dropped. He apologized and was allowed back on the team.

Accused of vandalism

Fast forward to the week of Father's Day in 2018, when the car of Gaffney's former teammate and friend Lito Sheppard is caught on surveillance camera being vandalized. According to the police report, Sheppard told investigators he believed the man seen in the video was Jabar Gaffney.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Allegations of vandalism

Sheppard posted a photo from the surveillance video of the incident on his Facebook page, and people began to post that the man had similar features to Gaffney, and they believed that he was the man with a mystery woman. Gaffney says he didn't do it and doesn't know why Sheppard is accusing him.

Sheppard and Jabar Gaffney were childhood friends, playing ball together in high school and college. But, their friendship turned sour.

Harris: When did it fall apart? Your relationship with Lito Sheppard?

Gaffney: I don't really know? Father's Day.

Harris: Of last year?

Gaffney: Yeah.

Harris: So everything between you and Lito Sheppard has been okay you had an okay relationship with him until last year when you were accused of vandalizing his vehicle?

Gaffney: Yes.

Gaffney insists he didn’t have a grudge against Sheppard and Gaffney insists he is not the man in the surveillance video damaging Sheppard's car.

Harris: So have you seen the video? The surveillance video or the photos at least of the surveillance video that people have alleged is you? Have you seen it?

Gaffney: Yes, I have seen it.

Harris: And people say that it's you?

Gaffney: I say that they are lying.

Harris: Where were you that day?

Gaffney: I was with my kids. I was at church, and then I spent the rest of that day with my kids at the house. We were watching movies and we left to go to Popeye's which is just a couple of miles down the street from my house and came back. That's where I was -- with my family.

Gaffney's arrest warrant obtained by the I-TEAM claims the night of the vandalism, another surveillance camera -- one from the Jacksonville neighborhood where Gaffney was living -- captured Gaffney and a woman leaving the neighborhood in the same Audi spotted a short time later pulling up to Sheppard's BMW in Jax Beach

Gaffney told us he was with his children that day, and he does not know who that woman is in the surveillance photos. He showed us a copy of a Popeye's transaction from his bank account from that same day that he said supports his claim of not being the person who vandalized Sheppard's car. However, the document does not show the time of the transaction made at the Neptune Beach restaurant.

""I have pictures of me on Father's Day showing what I look like. The guy in that picture, he looks like he had a haircut I have very long hair and again there's no tattoos and again the guy at the beach, it wasn't me,"" said Gaffney.

Gaffney told us despite the felony charge against him, and despite the fact that Sheppard filed a temporary restraining order that later expired, he still sees Sheppard as a brother.

Harris: If you could talk to Lito right now, what would you say?

Gaffney: Why? That's all I could say. Why? There is nothing else. He knows, he knows that I didn't do it. He knows that it was not me or else there would be all kinds of evidence.

Gaffney's next pre-trial hearing in the vandalism case is set for May 14 with jury selection in his trial set for May 20. However, his attorneys have filed a motion to delay the trial.

The I-TEAM reached out to Lito Sheppard for comment on Gaffney's interview and he said, ""I have nothing to comment about. I'll let him (Jabar Gaffney) proceed.""

Held under the Baker Act

Harris: There is the charge about the vandalism for the vehicle, then we hear information about you being suicidal or wanting to hurt yourself. What was that?

Gaffney: That was, I don't know. I don't know. That was girls being upset with me being brutally honest it was two girls that I was talking to and trying to make connections with and along the way things got turned ugly and we weren't going to see each other.

Gaffney: They made a call to police and said that I wanted to kill myself and that was totally false. I was on the way to Tampa that day. My son had a band recital. He was playing in the band and that was his first time he was going to be performing and I was going to see my son that day. I had never once tried to kill myself at all.

Harris: So then, how do you explain police being at that house and saying that you were taken and committed somewhere? Are you saying that never happened?

Gaffney: I just came out because I was getting phone calls and they were saying that the police were at my house. I said the police are not at my house, I'm in here. I got this call from my sister I told her no I'm fine. She was like are you sure? I was like, ain't nobody at my house because I didn't know that anything was going on. I had took a nap and I was getting ready to get on the road and I walked outside and it's like 50 guns pointed at me and I just I just dropped like I didn't know what to do I just froze up because that was terrifying. I didn't expect to see a whole bunch of guns drawn out on me in front of my house. They took me to the mental health place and locked me up there.

Gaffney said he was at the mental health facility for three days. Prior to arriving there, he said he got sick -- but it was not because he had ingested pills or was trying to kill himself.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Accusations of mental health issues, brain injury

""When I got to the place, they took a sample, drug tested me, didn't find anything. Didn't find no sleeping pills at all in my system. The police were at my house. They came in, they went through my house. There was no gun found in my house or anything,"" he said.

Gaffney said the women made a false claim to police.

Harris: So you are saying you were falsely committed in a mental facility for three days?

Gaffney: Yes.

Harris: What was it like being in there?

Gaffney: It was tough, but I mean I prayed about it and I was just like, God wouldn't have me here if it wasn't a reason behind it I guess. I mean it did good. I got to talk to a lot of people there about this and I talked to the doctor. He said that I was fine, that he just wanted me to stay because I could be a good influence on people that was the whole reason for keeping me there not because I was trying to commit suicide or because I had anything in my system. Got to meet with people, got to pray with people. Made friends with a skin head. I mean it was, I tried to make the best of it so that it wouldn't tear me down that I was in there for no reason.

Accused of having a brain injury from playing football

Shortly after Jabar Gaffney was held for three days, his uncle, Councilman Reggie Gaffney, spoke to the I-TEAM about Jabar. His uncle claimed Jabar's mood had changed. Jabar told us he didn't know his uncle was doing the interview until News4Jax called, asking Jabar for a statement about his uncle's comments.

Harris:​​​​​ What do you have to say about what your uncle said?

Gaffney: It was very disheartening to hear coming from him, when they don't even, me and my uncle, we don't even talk too much.

Harris: So as far as your uncle, do you feel like he even has the ability or the right to say what he is saying?

Gaffney: No, not at all, anybody in my family that should've answered that question should've been my dad or my mom or grandmother.

Gaffney told us his legal issues have reached the ears of his children. He said he comforts them, explaining their dad is fine.

Harris: How do you explain that to them?

Gaffney: Before they could say anything I said, ""You know I love you, right? You know your dad is not going anywhere?"" They said, ""We know."" They smile, (I) hug them and that's it. That's the end of the conversation.

Accused of domestic violence

Jabar Gaffney has also had protective orders filed against him, but he said he's never hit a woman. But, he said women have hit him.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Allegations of domestic violence

Harris: You've also been accused of domestic violence, what do you have to say to that?

Gaffney: That it was all false.

Harris: Why was it false?

Gaffney: Because it was, it was females that were upset and trying to take me down and one of their words was...one of their own words was I am going to take down your whole empire and they just got mad at me for whatever reason it may have been. And trying to take a shot at ruining my name.

Harris: So you never hit a woman in your life?

Gaffney: No.

Harris: Never hit a woman before?

Gaffney: No.

Harris: Never did anything against a woman?

Gaffney: No, never, never before. I have been hit a lot and I have called the police on women and nothing ever happened.

Harris: And why have they been assaulting you?

Gaffney: The same thing. Jealousy for whatever reason.

Accusations of being a ""troublemaker""

Harris: You have these incidents that keep happening and this person says to you, why you? Why do bad things keep happening to you and do you take an accountability for it?

Gaffney: I take accountability for everything that I have ever done in my life. I have always come clean on what I have done whether it was me by myself or other people with me. Like I have always just said my name and never told on anybody else.

For Gaffney, he believes the damage is already done. He told us his mistakes coupled with his name being tarnished has cost him honors at his alma mater.

Gaffney: It cost me part of my legacy with the University of Florida.

Harris: How so?

Gaffney: I am still not in the Athletic Hall of Fame right now. I am not in the Ring of Honor even though I meet the qualifications.

Gaffney: I was the best receiver that ever came through the University of Florida. There has never been a receiver that has two thousand-yard seasons back-to-back. Averaged 100 yards and a touchdown every game. Nobody has came through and done that at the university. Walter Camp, All-American everything, I was the team MVP, National Freshman of the Year, did everything to be in their Athletic Hall of Fame. But it seems like, after that Florida-Georgia thing and Hall of Fame induction, the hate started turning up a little more. The trouble came and from that point, I mean, it's 2019 and I still haven't been put in there, I mean, I know that has something to do with it.

For every accusation, Gaffney said he has been told to remain silent. He said he is tired of being silent. In breaking his silence, he recalls advice given to him from his former New England Patriots coach.

Gaffney: Coach Belichick always told us to speak for yourself so I am here to speak for myself I don't need anyone else to speaking for me anymore.

Harris: What is next for you in your life?

Gaffney: Just continuing what I have been doing, just trying to help the youth reach their potential work with Scott Park. Since we got Scott Park, we have kids going to college every year. It puts a smile on my face.

Gaffney said he has been working behind the scenes to help the youth football teams that practice and play there. As he helps the children with similar dreams of being an NFL star he is cutting people out of his personal life.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Accusations of being a ""troublemaker""

""I am going to continue to live my life, I cut, cut a lot of people out of my life that's how I have been able to stay out of the limelight without negative people around, without people that want to be in your business,"" said Gaffney.

He told us his faith in God keeps him centered.

""I am not saying that I lived a perfect life but I know I am not close to what I am being perceived as now and that's not fair,"" he explained.

Since this interview, Gaffney says he now has a medicinal marijuana card for Florida, which allows him to smoke cannabis for health reasons.

732,Police: Stepfather of missing girl changed story,"HOUSTON (AP) — The Latest on the search for a 4-year-old girl who was reported missing in Houston (all times local):

7:30 p.m.

Police in a suburb of Houston say a Texas man who reported his 4-year-old stepdaughter missing Saturday repeatedly changed his story during initial interviews.

Houston police say Darion Vence told investigators Maleah Davis was abducted more than 24-hours earlier by men in a pickup truck who knocked him out but then let him and his 2-year-old son go.

But Vence was first interviewed by Sugar Land police, and a spokesman for that city’s department says his account “changed several times.”

Houston police are leading the investigation. They say it is ongoing and that they don’t identify “persons of interest or suspects unless charges are filed.”

A phone message requesting comment left at a number listed for Vence was not immediately returned.

Sugar Land is about 22 miles (35.4 kilometers) southwest of Houston.

___

2:30 p.m.

A 4-year-old Houston girl who has been missing since her stepfather reported she was abducted had previously been removed from her home by state workers concerned about allegations of physical abuse.

Officials with state Child Protective Services in Houston say Maleah Davis was removed from her home in August after she suffered a head injury and was then returned to the home in February. Her two brothers also were removed over that period. All three were placed with relatives.

CPS caseworkers have been monitoring the home since the children were returned.

Searchers are looking for the girl after her stepfather reported he stopped their vehicle Friday night to check a tire when the men pulled up behind them.

Darion Vence told authorities he was knocked unconscious and when he awoke the next day, Maleah was gone.",http://www.wfla.com/national/police-stepfather-of-missing-girl-changed-story/1992269281,2019-05-09T16:03:04Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

SPRING HILL, Fla. (WFLA) - A man accused of dragging a pit bull behind a truck in Spring Hill is now in custody, according to online jail records.

Gregory Tousignant, 58, a transient, was arrested for animal cruelty and booked into the Hernando County Jail at about 9:20 p.m. Wednesday.

RELATED: Pit bull recovering after being dragged by truck in Spring Hill

According to deputies, witnesses reported seeing a dog tied to bumper of Tousignant's truck by a piece of rope that was attached to the animal's collar.

Deputies said Tousignant was unaware the dog had jumped out of the bed of his truck.

It is illegal to carry any pet in the bed of a truck that is not properly secured and prevented from jumping out of a moving vehicle.

Tousignant’s faces a misdemeanor charge of Cruelty to Animals, which carries a $1,000 bond. In the meantime, the pit bull is being fostered at a vet tech's house and might be available for adoption once he is healed.",https://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/hernando-county/hernando-county-deputies-seek-dog-dragging-suspect/1989307048,2019-05-09T09:17:56Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
734,Man fighting to save home after City of Dunedin moves to foreclose for grass not being cut,"DUNEDIN, Fla. (WFLA) - A man is fighting to save his house after the city he lives in has made moves to foreclose on his home for not cutting his grass.

Jim Fick doesn't argue that his yard should have been mowed when he was out of town, but he doesn't think he should lose his home over uncut grass.

When he left for North Carolina in May 2018 to sell his late mother's condo, he made arrangements for a friend to cut his grass.

""Apparently when you have the combination of the summer temperatures and it's raining every other day, it's just that growing season [for grass],"" says Fick.

But his friend suddenly died.

He didn't find out until he returned mid July.

A city of Dunedin code inspector found his grass to be more than 10 inches tall on July 5. Considering him a repeat offender, they started fining him $500 a day.

Fick says in the past when his grass has gotten too high, he's gotten notices in the mail, but when it came to the moment he's getting fined hundreds of dollars a day, he heard nothing from the city of Dunedin.

""In my case they didn't even mail the notice until August 22 or 23 to let me know that they were running the fines since July 5,"" said Fick.

He had to leave in August and was fined again for an additional 10 days of tall grass.

""Of course by then the fine had already run the $28,000 in recurring.""

The Dunedin code enforcement board has now moved to foreclose on Fick's home and he is hoping the 8th Amendment and lawyers at the Institute for Justice will save his home.

""We are arguing in our lawsuit that limitless fines are unconstitutional,"" said the Institute for Justice's lead attorney on the case, Ari Bargil.

According to Fick's attorneys, they say, depending on the outcome of the case, it could affect similar cases like his in the city of Dunedin.

The lawsuit against the city argues the fines are excessive.

739,"Pensacola suspect in toddler 'torture' case died by suicide, sheriff confirms","A Pensacola man accused of inflicting ""systematic torture"" on a toddler has died roughly one week after hanging himself in his jail cell, according to an Escambia County Sheriff's Office investigation.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, was found hanging in his jail cell around 11 p.m. May 1, a few hours after being charged with physically and emotionally abusing his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter.

Celaius was transported to a local hospital, and he remained there until family members made the decision to terminate his life support. Celaius was pronounced deceased at 1:13 p.m. Tuesday, Sheriff David Morgan said Wednesday.

The Sheriff's Office has been investigating the incident per standard procedure, and Morgan said preliminary findings indicate that Celaius' injuries were self-inflicted. Morgan said security camera footage and activity logs indicated that county corrections staff had been walking the pod and inspecting cells in accordance with jail policy at the time of the incident.

The Sheriff's Office declined to comment on what implement Celaius used to hang himself, other than to say it was available in the cell.

Allegations of torture: In wolf mask and Batman PJs, Pensacola man tortured child for cameras, report says

Hospitalized: Pensacola man accused of 'torturing' toddler transported from jail to hospital

Escambia County revamped its suicide prevention policy a few years ago after a rash of deaths in the jail, but there has been significant turnover in the county administration, including four corrections directors over roughly the past five years.

Morgan noted that even with Celaius' death, the Sheriff's Office would continue its investigation into the abuse occurring in Celaius' home.

""We're looking for any additional victims, and anyone who might have had knowledge of the crimes being committed and failed to report them,"" Morgan said.

Noting that everyone has a legal obligation to report child abuse in Florida, the sheriff said, ""We'll continue with this case, and if we find out there are those who failed to report the abuse of children, they may be facing charges, too.""

Celaius' arrest report alleges that he had routinely abused the toddler over a two-month span by throwing objects at her as she slept, shooting her in the head repeatedly with a BB gun and jolting her with an electric dog collar. He allegedly recorded the abuse on home surveillance cameras and personal cellphones.

Morgan said the Sheriff's Office is working with the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies to investigate whether any of the videos had made their way to the internet or into the hands of others.

""Right now we have no proof the videos were shared or sold or anything else, but there is a market for — just like there is for child pornography — films involving torture,"" Morgan said, before adding for emphasis, ""But we don't have any indication of that right now.""

Celaius was initially booked into Escambia County Jail on April 9 on drug charges, but on May 1, the Sheriff's Office announced Celaius was facing new charges related to child abuse.

Jail personnel moved Celaius into protective custody immediately after the press conference announcing the new charges, but a few hours later, he was transported to a local hospital. County officials said he remained in the hospital until his death Tuesday.

One of Celaius friends, Eric Everett Furnans, was arrested after allegedly honoring Celaius' request to destroy cellphones believed to contain video of the abuse.

Morgan said the case again Furnans would be unaffected by Celaius' death.

Richard Ewers has only one week to live.KSAT reports the 71-year-old has made it his life's mission to give homes to dumped or stray dogs. After people learned last year he was dying of cancer, they stepped up to try to help his 27 rescue dogs. Mary Oyler, with Save Our Strays San Antonio, said Ewers has been put in hospice and there isn't much time left to find a place for his remaining 11 dogs. It is his dying wish that they all go to good homes. “They can't be here much longer,” said Oyler. Oyler and volunteers with Save Our Strays San Antonio have been coming to Ewers’ home every day to feed the dogs, spend time with them and give them water.“We are very sad by this, of course, and we want to make that last wish come true for him,” Oyler said.If the remaining dogs aren't adopted, they will be picked up by the county. “It would add a lot more stress to what they are going through already,” Oyler said. “Not having Mr. Richard here, there's confusion, loneliness. There's depression.”Oyler said her biggest concern is that the dogs are alone, and the conditions at Ewers' home are not ideal.“There's no one to give them attention and love,” Oyler said. “There is no running water. There is no electricity. The conditions are just not ideal.”She said whoever adopts the dogs will need to be patient with them.“There's a lot of work involved,” Oyler said. “All they've ever known is Mr. Richard, so it's going to require a family that has a lot of patience.”A Facebook page is available for anyone who wants to help Ewers and his dogs.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/man-with-one-week-to-live-has-dying-wish-of-getting-his-11-rescue-dogs-adopted/27402190,2019-05-08T10:13:00Z,WPBF-TV,Florida Man,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
743,"St. Augustine man arrested on drug charges, then deputies found child porn","ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. - A 31-year-old man was arrested last week on drug charges later charged with 10 counts of possession of child pornography, according to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies were alerted by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that John Violano was uploading content possibly related to child pornography. After AT&T and Microsoft were subpoenaed to obtain the IP address and physical address connected to the screen name being used, a search warrant was served at a home on with Violano inside the residence.

Several electronic devices were seized from the residence. A forensic analysis of the thumb drive revealed an assortment of photographs and videos, including several male children from ages 8 to 16 engaging in sexually explicit acts, according to the arrest report.

Violano bail was set at $250,000.

Anyone with information about the case is asked to contact the St. John’s County Sheriff's Office.

744,Orange Park man charged with production of child porn,"An Orange Park man was indicted on four counts of child pornography, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida announced Tuesday.

Michael Glenn Chope, 55, was ordered detained pending trial.

According to court documents, on March 13, detectives from the Clay County Sheriff’s Office met with Chope regarding an investigation into a cybertip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children related to child pornography. Chope confirmed his email address and telephone number were the same ones identified during the investigation and stated he was the only one who used his electronics and computers, federal prosecutors said.

Chope also admitted to viewing and possessing child pornography, including on several devices in his home, according to prosecutors.

Detectives said they seized multiple electronic devices from Chope’s home and analyzed their contents. Detectives said they located numerous images produced by Chope depicting him sexually abusing and exploiting a child.

After the Sheriff’s Office contacted Chope, he fled the state, deputies said. He was captured April 3 in Texas, according to deputies.The Sheriff’s Office praised the U.S. Marshals Service, Department of Homeland Security and Texas law enforcement agencies, among others, for helping with the arrest.

Prosecutors said Chope was originally charged by federal complaint for a single count of production of child pornography and was later indicted on four counts of production of child pornography that had been created between May 2015 and February 2018.

Accusations of stolen cocaine escalated into kidnapping and torture over the weekend in Titusville, according to police reports.

Two men were arrested and charged with attempted murder and kidnapping. Police said the two beat and waterboarded a man after suspecting his friend had stolen cocaine from them Saturday.

Police were called about 12:30 a.m. Sunday when a battered man was admitted to the hospital, according to arrest reports. He had been pistol-whipped, waterboarded and force-fed dog food.



John Faulk, 27, of Titusville, and Steven Erickson, 24, of Cocoa, were charged with attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and inflicting harm on the person, robbery with a firearm and second-degree grand theft.

After a long day of drinking and using cocaine, the men believed their victim's friend had stolen cocaine from them before leaving to get food, police said. So they restrained the man's hands with tape and covered his nose and mouth with cloth before pouring water over his face, telling him to get his friend to return the cocaine or they would kill him.



They used table legs and a gun to beat him before uncovering his mouth to feed him dog food, police reported.

The torture lasted about 45 minutes before the man escaped to a nearby friend's house and then went to the hospital. Police said the suspects also stole the man's cell phone and over $800.

After police were called, officers responded to a Beverly Street home where gunshots from inside the residence prompted a SWAT response as well, Titusville police said.

“The SWAT team responded with tactical measures and two suspects were taken into custody,” according to a statement from Amy Matthews, spokeswoman for the Titusville Police Department.

Matthews did not say what tactical measures were used when arresting Faulk and Erickson at the home.

No further information was available about the incidents Monday afternoon. The case remains an ongoing investigation.



Faulk is being held at the Brevard County Jail Complex in lieu of $115,000 bond. Erickson is being held in lieu of $122,000 bond.

748,Man and his blind dog complete thru-hike of Florida Trail,"While Kyle Rohrig’s little canine hiking companion, Katana, recently lost her eyesight, she has kept her spirit of adventure.

The Navarre resident’s pooch is a Shiba Inu, a Japanese breed of hunting dog. Glaucoma caused her to lose one of her eyes at age 5 and her other eye shortly after she turned 8 late last year.

In earlier years, Katana had joined her owner for long-distance treks on paths such as the Appalachian Trail, on which she was able to walk more than 30 miles per day on her own.

Her total blindness came about two months before Rohrig’s planned hike on the Florida National Scenic Trail, which stretches more than 1,100 miles between Big Cypress National Preserve by Miami and Fort Pickens near Pensacola.

“On this hike, with her recently becoming completely blind, I was really nervous about how she would do,” said Rohrig, 29. “I was worried she would be miserable and I would be miserable, but she rose to the occasion and did a lot better than I thought she would.

""She was happy playing on the trail and she would take the lead sometimes. I don’t know how, but she would stay down the center of the trail. It was really emotional for me to see how well she did in her current circumstances.”

When the pair approached deep swampy areas and other places in poor condition, or when they faced dozens of miles of walking on roads around hurricane-damaged areas, Rohrig would hoist the 21-pound Katana onto his backpack.

He estimates he carried her for more than 800 miles of their journey.

The pair initially headed north on the trail from Big Cypress on Dec. 30. After more than 50 miles of hiking, they returned to the trailhead because a friend of Rohrig’s wanted to join him and hike the entire trail.

The trio departed on Jan. 8 and finished the Florida Trail on April 1.

Dealing with insects and not being able to cool down at night were tough, but the 30 miles of hiking in Big Cypress were the hardest part of the overall journey, Rohrig said.

“The mud and water were just ridiculous,” he said. “And during my first time there, it was around 80 or 90 degrees. They were having a heat wave.”

A few days after Rohrig and his hiking buddies finished their trek by Pensacola, hunters posted a photo and breaking news online of the largest female Burmese python ever captured in Big Cypress.

Rohrig said he didn’t see any pythons while in South Florida, but he did see “tons” of other kinds of snakes, as well as hundreds of alligators, during the thru-hike.

The snakes he spotted included coral snakes, pygmy rattlers, corn snakes, coachwhips and an eastern diamondback rattlesnake. None of the critters acted aggressively, Rohrig said.

He plans to hike Vermont’s 272-mile Long Trail in May and start hiking the 3,100-mile Continental Divide Trail between Canada and Mexico in June. Rohrig said Katana might join him on the Long Trail.

Rohrig has written several books, including “Lost on the Appalachian Trail,” about his various hiking adventures. He hiked the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail between Canada and Mexico three years ago.

“I write and I hike and I fish,” he said. “I’m living the dream.”",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190425/man-and-his-blind-dog-complete-thru-hike-of-florida-trail?rssfeed=true,2019-04-25T14:57:14Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Florida Man,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
749,"Large, flightless bird that killed Florida man set to be auctioned","Related Headlines Man killed by large, exotic bird in Alachua County

- A large, flightless exotic bird likened to a 'living dinosaur' and infamous for killing its 75-year-old owner in Florida this month is back on the market.

The razor-clawed cassowary is one of among 100 exotic animals from the departed owner's estate going up for auction.

READ MORE @FOXNEWS

Gulf Coast Livestock Auction said in a Facebook post the auction of the killer cassowary is in accordance with the last wishes of Marvin Hajos.

""One of Marvin’s wishes were his animals be sold at auction as soon as possible,"" the group said. ""This is an absolute auction and complete dispersal of his animal collection.""

The auction is to be held Saturday at noon and is billed as featuring ""rare, odd and unusual breeds."" Members of the news media, in addition to video recording devices, are banned from the event.

""Anyone seen video taping in any capacity will be deemed trespassing and will be escorted out by security,"" a post by the group reads. ""Your video equipment may or may not be confiscated until all video recordings are distroyed (sic). Please do not comprise (sic) our position.”

Gulf Coast Livestock Auction Manager Jammi Wilson told the Gainesville Sun the business has all the licenses to proceed with the auction.

“I don’t want to talk about it,” she reportedly told the paper before hanging up. “It’s really no one’s business.”

Alachua County Sheriff's officials said Hajos had fallen April 12 when the bird attacked him. First responders rushed Hajos to a hospital, but he died from his injuries.

“Initial information indicates that this was a tragic accident for Mr. Hajos and his family,” department spokesperson Lt. Brett Rhodenizer told the Gainesville Sun.

Cassowaries are similar to emus, standing up to 6 feet tall and weighing up to 130 pounds.

""The cassowary is rightfully considered the most dangerous bird in the world,"" according to the San Diego Zoo. ""Each 3-toed foot has a dagger-like claw on the inner toe that is up to 4 inches long! The cassowary can slice open any predator or potential threat with a single swift kick.""

The animals being auctioned include two double-wattled cassowaries and five ring-tailed and ruffled lemurs.

Fish and Wildlife spokesman Robert Klepper said buyers must be licensed to legally possess the animals.

Layne Chesney, a Florida teen who suffered burns over 95 percent of her body on New Year's Eve in 2017, died Friday.People running the Facebook page ""Pray for Layne Chesney"" posted the update on Layne, who was 16.""Layne was called home today by our creator. She fought a hard battle right until the end -- never wanting to quit -- because quitting was not in her nature.""Layne had been receiving care in the burn unit of Jackson Memorial Hospital and later in Texas. In June, Layne had been showing signs of progress, including being able to walk about 25 feet. ""We are heart broken, but remain always grateful that she was a part of our lives and world -- we just wish it had been for a lot longer with us here on Earth,"" the Facebook post said.""We ask that you give the family time to grieve. Leigh Ann has asked that contacts not be made as they all need time to grieve, process, and move through this terrible loss. Thank you all for your love, prayers and support that you have shown for Layne and our family. We are broken.""On Wednesday, a Facebook post said ""she's been having difficulty maintaining her oxygen saturation levels and her blood pressure has been less than stable. Her latest grafts really didn’t adhere as well as we had hoped. ... Her urine output has declined and her heart function isn’t quite as good as the last time she was evaluated.""Layne had poured gasoline on a bonfire on a fire pit at a friend's house when she was 14.She attended Lincoln Park Academy, where she played softball.Layne was the star of the Jensen Beach Wildcats when they won the World Series in the summer of 2017. Last June, girls from her Treasure Coast team were playing in the World Series in her honor at Pineapple Park in Jensen Beach, including wearing her initials and uniform number written on their arms. Even their opponents in the championship game, a team from Louisiana, had #LAYNESTRONG written on the back of their helmets.The first pitch was thrown out by Layne’s grandfather, Tony Wirz.“People from all over the world literally have contacted us saying, ‘We are playing for Layne. We know you guys will do this for Layne,’” teammate Emily MacMullen said at the time.MacMullen and several of her teammates wore special shirts made for Layne's 16th birthday, with the letters ""GIVING UP IS NOT AN OPTION"". ""She was very energetic, always had a smile on her face and she had a weird sense of humor that was just hilarious,"" MacMullen said. The St. Lucie Sheriff's Office posted a tribute.""Our hearts are heavy this afternoon as we hear of the passing of sweet Layne Chesney,"" the Sheriff's Office wrote. ""Layne brought this community together and we fought alongside her for the last 16 months. Today, we know she is at peace and we pray that peace will extend to her family and friends during this difficult time. #LayneStrong""",https://www.mor-tv.com/article/fort-pierce-teen-dies-1-5-years-after-burned-in-bonfire/27442399,2019-05-11T17:01:00Z,MOR-TV,Florida Man,"7201 E Hillsborough Ave, Tampa, FL 33610, USA",FL,33610
753,Sunroof rider accused of felony domestic violence,"LAKELAND — A Lakeland man who stood up in his sunroof with his car on cruise control while driving down I-4 was arrested by the Florida Highway Patrol on Tuesday, not only for his wreckless driving, but also for a Polk County Sheriff's Office warrant for domestic violence.

Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies had made contact with 70-year-old Leonard Olsen by phone on Tuesday, and he agreed to turn himself in to the PCSO Northwest District substation on Wedgewood Estates Boulevard in North Lakeland, according to reports. But while the deputies were on their way to meet him, they noticed the FHP had pulled him over.

After he was booked into the South County Jail, deputies served the PCSO warrant for felony domestic violence.

The domestic violence was reported to have started on April 30, when Olsen allegedly became upset with the victim for taking too long to come to bed. Once she was in bed, he began calling her names and blaring the music so she could not sleep, according to reports.

Olsen then reached over and choked the victim, according to his arrest affidavit. In pain and though her breathing was restricted, according to reports, she was eventually able to push Olsen away and they went to bed without further incident. The following day, she had a hoarse voice and had bruising on her neck.

On Sunday, May 5, during the evening hours, the victim returned from dinner with her daughter and grandchild. As she began changing into her pajamas to get ready for bed, she came out of the bathroom to see Olsen ripping apart the dress she had been wearing. Olsen then allegedly called her vulgar names and accused her of having an affair. Then Olsen asked where her bra was located, and when she did not initially give him the bra, he threatened to destroy every bra in her dresser if she did not give it to him, according to his arrest affidavit. Once she gave him the bra, he also tore that apart and then asked where her underwear was that she had been wearing and when she said she was still wearing it, he allegedly began pulling on them in a violent fashion.

According to his arrest affidavit, Olsen continued to yell vulgarities at her and played the music loudly so she could not fall asleep, for several hours.

On Monday, May 6, about 6 a.m., Olsen woke up and began slamming dresser drawers, turning the lights on and off, and turning on the music, waking up the victim, according to PCSO reports released to the media Saturday afternoon.

Since the victim could not fall back asleep, she went into the bathroom and began listening to a motivational verse on her cellphone, which was on the bathroom counter. Olsen allegedly walked into the bathroom, took her cellphone and put it in his pocket. The victim followed Olsen into the bedroom to try to get her cellphone back.

According to his arrest affidavit, Olsen reached out and pushed the victim, causing her to fall onto the bed, then straddled the victim by placing one hand on her upper arm and one hand on her throat.

The victim was able to push Olsen's hand off her throat, but then he allegedly placed his thumb in the victim's mouth, which she bit. Once the victim bit Olsen, he moved off of the victim, according to his arrest affidavit.

At this point, Olsen then allegedly blocked the bedroom door, and refused to move at first. Later, Olsen left the residence and the victim called law enforcement to report the incident.

Olsen and the victim have three children in common and have been together 47 years.

Olsen is being held on $21,000 bond at Polk County Jail, $5,000 per PCSO domestic violence charge, and $1,000 per the FHP charge.

754,"After regular Baker Act committals, program helps teen","NAPLES — Caleb Caldwell's delicate peace with himself wavered earlier this year when a violent outburst nearly led to a mental health evaluation under Florida's Baker Act — yet again.

The 19-year-old from Naples had skipped some of the medications he takes to treat symptoms of his bipolar disorder and got into an argument with his mother and brother.

""He was being very violent. And he did put his hands on me,"" said his mother, Mellisa Caldwell. ""He just gets really out of hand. He does. And he's a big guy.""

But given the troubles of Caleb's life, the fact this lapse was not worse is something of a victory.

Caleb, an otherwise soft-spoken young man who finally landed a paying job and hopes to work in sports medicine, spent most of his early and mid-adolescence in and out of mental health crisis units.

It was before his condition had been fully diagnosed, and his prescribed medication was wanting.

He was bullied. He had violent outbursts at home and at school. He regularly threatened suicide. And at one point, he was getting committed under the Baker Act nearly every other week.

The boy's troubling behavior, his later mood swings and propensity to violence — seemingly without remorse — even prompted one psychiatrist to tell the Naples family that the boy had ""sociopathic criminal potential.""

So much happened, and so much of it seems like a blur to Caleb.

""A lot of this has been going on for so long that I don't remember a lot,"" Caleb said.

Then, when he was 16, after one of his threats to kill himself and another Baker Act evaluation at the David Lawrence Center in East Naples, real progress: a new diagnosis and treatment plan that seemed to better address his behavior problems.

It turns out that Caleb, now 19, was on the autism spectrum, something multiple mental health professionals he encountered failed to notice, according to his family. He got different medications and found a mental health counselor who is helping him control his impulses.

He soon got an internship with the NCH Baker Downtown Hospital as part of the Project SEARCH program, which helps find jobs for teens and young adults with developmental disabilities.

Before his last behavioral lapse — the first serious one in years — Caleb said he hoped those days were behind him.

""There are times when I have some issues, but it doesn't get to that point anymore,"" he said.

But the family knows there will never be a treatment silver bullet. Caleb's problems will never just go away.

They consider themselves lucky because of the help from the David Lawrence Center and that they have the means to aggressively work to find him treatment. But they worry about Caleb's future.

He is transitioning into the working world. He still lives with his parents, but if he is committed under the Baker Act again, now as an adult, law enforcement officers would not be required to contact them.

Mellisa Caldwell is trying to establish legal guardianship of him into adulthood. Caleb isn't quite sure what he thinks about that.

""I feel like there are times that I need it,"" he said. ""But I think there are times when I need my own space and think I'm fine on my own. But I do think there are times — like when I get Baker Acted - what would I have done if she wasn't there?""",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190511/after-regular-baker-act-committals-program-helps-teen?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T16:26:25Z,News Chief,Florida Man,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881
756,Suzy Fleming Leonard: Scott's on Fifth chef invited to cook at James Beard House in NYC,"CLOSE Scott Earick, chef and owner at Scott's on Fifth in Indialantic, talks about his love for cooking -- and tacos. Suzy Fleming Leonard, FLORIDA TODAY

Being my friend comes with a cost.

Since chef Scott Earick and I met eight years ago, my causes have become his causes. He’s closed his restaurant on a potentially busy Friday night to cook for the Brevard Zoo. He’s scaled the side of a building and spent his one free night a week teaching a cooking class for Habitat for Humanity. He’s spent a Sunday morning stirring together lobster bisque for Daily Bread.

I’m not even counting the time he showed my book club how to make his signature Bang Bang Sauce or the video I shot while I talked him into trying durian fruit.

All I have to do is ask, and he puts on an apron, grabs a spatula and goes to work.

The owner of Scott’s on Fifth in Indialantic has a big personality, an even bigger heart, and I love him for both.

When your friends are good to you, you want great things for them, so I have to admit, I'm a little giddy over what's happening for Scott right now.

At 58, he’s been given an honor few in his chosen profession will achieve. He’ll be cooking at the venerable James Beard House in New York City.

It’s not an honor he sought, but it's one he's thrilled to accept.

The invitation came after James Beard Award-winning chef Deborah VanTrece of Twisted Soul Cookhouse & Pours in Atlanta dined at his restaurant. The soul food maven was easily won over by Scott's classic cooking style and easy charm.

Deborah will be cooking at the James Beard Foundation’s Cheers, Queers! cocktail party June 28 during New York’s World Pride Week. She asked Scott if he'd like to join the fun.

Jamesbeard.org describes the event as ""a talented roster of chefs and personalities at this walk-around cocktail soirée. We know James Beard would be tickled pink!""

Headlining the list of top chefs is Art Smith, former chef for Oprah Winfrey and Florida governors Bob Graham and Jeb Bush. He has restaurants across the country, including Chef Art Smith's Homecomin' in Disney Springs.

Scott said he didn’t believe it was real until he got an email confirmation from the James Beard Foundation, a culinary organization with a mission to ""celebrate, nurture and honor chefs and other leaders making America's food culture more delicious, diverse, and sustainable for everyone.""

Scott especially is excited about being in New York for Gay Pride Week. June 28 marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, which are credited with beginning the gay rights movement.

Sure, Scott has felt the sting of anti-gay bias.

""We all have at one time or another,"" he said.

But because of people like those who participated in Stonewall, he's never been afraid to be himself.

""I love who I am,"" he said. ""I never thought anything was wrong with me. I love someone who is in the same mindset that I am. That's the way I look at it.""

Of course, when Scott gets in front of the stove, none of that matters. He’s doing what he loves, and that’s the only validation he needs.

His father was a food broker, so he grew up around the business.

He’s not a classically trained chef. Born in Hollywood, California, he grew up in Wisconsin and Italy. He did some modeling and landed a recurring role on the Italian soap opera, “La Piovra.”

In the mid-1980s, he moved to Tampa and opened Giovanna’s, an Italian restaurant named after his mother. As the owner, he wanted to learn every aspect of the business. An unreliable chef meant he ended up in the kitchen.

Next came a few years in Tallahassee, where he hosted the television show “Capital Dish,” inviting politicians and local celebrities on camera to cook.

He opened Scott’s on Fifth in 2006. The restaurant celebrated its 13th anniversary on Valentine's Day.

He can't wait to take the Scott's on Fifth show to New York. He plans to make Key West Pink Shrimp Wontons.

""I thought Key West pinks were perfect for a Cheers, Queers! party,"" he said.

He'll tour the city with his husband, Hank Hutson, then he'll come back home to Indialantic. He'll do the daily shopping. He'll place the liquor orders, and do the dishes and clean the restrooms, all the less-than-glamorous things that go with owning a restaurant.

He'll continue to delight guests with angel hair Bolognese, crispy snapper, steak Diane, lobster bisque and his uninhibited joy for cooking.

And, if I'm lucky, he'll continue to be my friend, despite the cost.

757,"Known animal abuser back in business, undercover videos show","<p>Undercover video taken at a property in northwest Miami-Dade County depicts the brutal methods used to slaughter livestock. The video, taken by the Animal Recovery Mission on Dec. 30, 2018, shows a worker trying unsuccessfully to use a device to stun a pig. The man, seen smoking a cigarette during the slaughter, then appears to stab the pig several times as the animal kicks and struggles violently.</p>

<p>""The biggest rule of slaughter is that the animal is insensitive to pain or unconscious,"" explained veterinarian Heidi Thomas, who reviewed the ARM video. ""And these animals are clearly not unconscious. They're struggling.""</p>

<p>Thomas, a large animal veterinarian, has served as an expert witness in animal cruelty cases in South Florida. She noted several issues with the treatment of the animals captured on camera.</p>

<p>""I believe that that's not in accordance with the law at all,"" Thomas said.</p>

<p>The owner of the property in the 13200 block of Northwest 182nd Street, Manuel Coto-Martinez, is well known to both law enforcement and prosecutors in Miami-Dade County.</p>

<p>It was November 2016 when Local 10 News reported on Coto's arrest after investigators said he sold horse meat to undercover detectives with Miami-Dade police on two occasions.</p>

<p>Coto, 73, was facing up to 10 years in prison based on the evidence and charges against him, but he instead served just a few months of probation on a misdemeanor animal neglect charge.</p>

<p>""He sold officers horse meat and did no time,"" ARM founder Richard Couto said. ""It is discouraging, and it should be a serious concern to all residents in our community. What is going on in Miami-Dade County?""</p>

<p></p>

<p>Couto said his investigators went into the property just before New Year's Eve after seeing groups of people gathered waiting to buy meat. Inside, they also witnessed illegal alcohol sales and Coto himself counting money as someone marked a pig by repeatedly hitting it with a hammer, a technique Thomas said could be done more humanely.</p>

<p>Local 10 News investigative reporter Amy Viteri rode along with Couto and ARM investigators through the area surrounding Coto's home, known as the C-9 basin.</p>

<p>""This is really no man's land,"" Couto said. ""Anything and everything goes in this area.""</p>

<p>The isolated zone off Okeechobee Road on the western border of Miami-Dade and Broward counties has been a known dumping ground for illegally slaughtered animals for years. Couto has been coming here and helping expose the criminal activity for over a decade.</p>

<p>""This is ground zero (for) horse slaughter in this county,"" he added.</p>

<p>Within minutes of driving down the road, Couto pointed out bags covered in flies containing animal remains. The first one held parts of a calf that Couto suspected had been butchered illegally and the parts discarded along the road.</p>

<p>After that, he found the remains of about five horses just feet from the road. Each time, the animal parts were found in trash bags.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Miami-Dade police reviewed the most recent video from Coto's property and promptly launched an investigation based on what they believed was illegal activity. In a police report, they wrote after a meeting with the Miami-Dade County State Attorney's Office that an assistant state attorney told them he ""did not find any criminal wrongdoing in the animal slaughter process.""</p>

<p>In a subsequent meeting, representatives from the state attorney's office told Local 10 News it is possible the video does show illegal activity, but the edited clip from just one occasion did not give them enough evidence to prosecute.</p>

<p>In Palm Beach County, State Attorney Dave Aronberg has on occasion personally prosecuted cases dealing with animal cruelty in order to send a message that the behavior will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>""I've made it a priority to go after felony animal cruelty because the laws are notoriously weak in our state,"" Aronberg said.</p>

<p>He explained slaughterhouses are governed by the same animal cruelty laws as everyone else and are not exempt. His office has been able to successfully use ARM videos to get recent convictions, including a large illegal slaughter case in 2016.</p>

<p>""Judges have upheld the ability for prosecutors to use these types of videos even if they're not taken by law enforcement, because law enforcement can't be everywhere,"" Aronberg said.</p>

<p>He said the video needs to be authenticated and meet certain standards but can provide advantages to investigators and prosecutors who face a high burden of proof trying to make these cases. Despite that, he said he feels they are worth pursuing.</p>

<p>""I feel these are so worthwhile to prosecute that I will prosecute them myself,"" he said. ""Because you can judge a community by how it treats its most vulnerable, and that includes our animals.""</p>

<p>State Sen. Jason Pizzo, D-Miami, is a former Miami-Dade prosecutor who has handled cases using video from ARM.

The Lake County Sheriff's Office says a deputy conducting the traffic stop was also injured during the incident, after being dragged by the suspect's car.

The deputy was attempting to take Sean Christopher Bentley, 27, into custody on a felony warrant for failing to appear on previous fleeing and eluding charges.

The deputy spotted Bentley at a convenience store at State Road 44 and County Road 437, but before the deputy could take him into custody, Bentley got into his car.

""Bentley got into his vehicle at which time he began to struggle with the deputy,"" said Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. John Herrell. ""The deputy deployed his taser, but Bentley put his vehicle in drive with the deputy still partially inside the car, dragging the deputy and causing injuries to his leg.""

Bentley was able to flee onto CR 437 but soon crashed into another vehicle. He then fled on foot before being apprehended in the Eagle Dunes subdivision.

""Shortly after being secured, Bentley had a medical episode and EMS was called to the scene.As EMS treated him, he became combative and lost consciousness,"" Lt. Herrell added.

764,Man with week to live has dying wish of getting his 11 rescue dogs adopted,"BEXAR COUNTY, TX (KSAT/CNN) – A Texas man was recently given one week to live. His final wish is to get his 11 rescue dogs adopted.

For two years, 71-year-old Richard Ewers has been taking in dumped or stray dogs. Volunteers and donors also stepped in to help vaccinate, spay and neuter the dogs, repair his fence and adopt the dogs out.

But during that time, Ewers was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Recently, he was put into hospice and given about a week to live.

Mary Oyler and other volunteers with “Save Our Strays San Antonio” have been coming to Ewers’ home every day to feed the dogs, spend time with them and give them water.

""We are all very saddened by this, of course, and we want to make that last wish come true for him,"" Oyler said.

Eleven dogs out of 27 are left since KSAT started following Ewers’ story last year.

Oyler said she’s hoping the final 11 dogs can be adopted to prevent them from being picked up by the county.

""It would add a lot more stress to what they’re going through already,” she said. “Not having Mr. Richard here, there's confusion, there’s loneliness, there's depression.""

Oyler said the conditions the dogs are living in are not ideal.

""There's no one to give them attention and love,” she said. “There is no running water, there is no electricity.”

She said whoever adopts or fosters the dogs will need to be patient.

""All they've ever known is Mr. Richard. So, it's going to require a family that will have a lot of patience,"" Oyler said.

A Facebook page called “Helping Mr. Richard and His Dogs” was created for anyone interested in adopting or fostering the dogs.

All the dogs have been spayed or neutered, but they’ll need to be taken to the vet for checkups.",https://www.wfla.com/national/man-with-week-to-live-has-dying-wish-of-getting-his-11-rescue-dogs-adopted/1988553213,2019-05-08T12:09:02Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

767,Man concerned overflowing manhole could pose health hazard,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A News4Jax viewer is concerned after he noticed sewer water overflowing from a manhole cover at a Jacksonville apartment complex.

The viewer, who asked to remain anonymous, said he took video of the overflowing water at The Commons Apartments. He's concerned the water could lead to health problems for the people who live there, including his nephew.

City records show a sewage overflow complaint was filed on Aug. 27, 2013. Another was filed on Feb. 6, 2018.

A statement from a manager for The Commons reads in part:

""We did not own the property in 2013 and cannot provide comment. The sewage problem last year was resolved. The equipment has been repaired.""

The viewer said he recorded the video in the past 30 days. He believes management doesn't know about a new potential problem.

""It's not true that it's been fixed,"" the viewer said. ""It may have been worked on back then but this is very much ongoing and particularly on the weekend and late afternoon.""

LAKE CITY — Authorities say a Florida man was jailed after refusing to remove an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

A Columbia County Sheriff's Office report says 23-year-old Dillon Shane Webb was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence.

It says a deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite. The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court.

Officials say the deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part but Webb refused, citing his First Amendment free speech rights. The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail.

770,Cyberstalking of alleged battery victim lands Rockledge man back in jail,"CLOSE And it can happen to anyone Lamaur Stancil

ROCKLEDGE — A judge has revoked the bail of the Rockledge man accused of torturing a woman and keeping her trapped in a dog crate.

One year ago, the Rockledge Public Safety Department charged Robert Carilli, 38, of the 900 block of Cardon Drive, with five crimes based on the woman's recount of her time being trapped. He spent a few weeks at the Brevard County Jail, then posted $60,000 bail.

The bail revocation hearing happened April 23. Carilli remained at the jail Tuesday without bail.

Previous story: Rockledge man accused of sadistic acts against woman

One of the conditions of his release was Carilli could not contact the woman. But the State Attorney's Office said that happened several times last summer, despite the woman leaving Florida, getting a new phone number and making adjustments to her social media accounts.

She had unknowingly connected with Carilli on Facebook when he created a fake profile impersonating another woman she knew, according to the police report. She told police he likely got her new cell number from her Facebook profile as well and began sending text messages. Despite blocking his number, Carilli used other phone lines to continue texting her, police said.

One message sent to the woman included a map attachment featuring her new home.

In September, prosecutors filed a motion to revoke Carilli's bail. The 33-year-old woman who said she was Carilli's captive asked that she be able to testify remotely because she had moved out of state and wouldn't be able to leave work to travel. That request required its own motion and hearing separate from the bond revocation hearing.

""Due to the overall context of this case, to include the overall allegations of prior sadomasochistic sexual abuse perpetuated by the defendant, it would be unduly and extraordinarily traumatic for (her) to appear in the actual physical presence of the defendant at this time,"" Assistant State Attorney Michael Doyle wrote in the motion to allow her to testify via Skype.

The woman said she will testify in person at trial, Doyle said.

A judge granted the Skype request in December. A date for the bail hearing was set for March 1, then rescheduled for April 23.

Carilli is charged with two counts of aggravated battery and charges of false imprisonment, domestic violence and domestic battery by strangulation. Rockledge investigators said Carilli spent months torturing the woman and treating her as a slave.

Carilli's next court appearance is scheduled for June 19. He will remain at the jail until his case is resolved, according to a court order.

771,Family of slain motorist celebrates after Florida officer sentenced,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Corey Jones’s family sang the gospel song “Victory is Mine” as they walked out of a Florida courthouse, celebrating after a judge handed a 25-year sentence to a former police officer for killing the stranded black motorist in 2015.

Fired Palm Beach Gardens officer Nouman Raja on Thursday became the first Florida law enforcement agent in nearly 30 years to be convicted and sentenced for an on-duty killing — and one of only a few officers nationwide.

Raja, 41, had told investigators he fired after Jones pulled a gun on him, but an audiotape of their encounter led prosecutors and jurors to believe Raja instigated their altercation. And last month a jury convicted Raja of manslaughter and attempted murder in the death of the 31-year-old musician who was gunned down after his SUV stalled on the road home from a nightclub performance.

“We knew what the truth was and we stood by that,” his father, Clinton Jones Sr., told reporters after Thursday’s sentencing. He said he never doubted Raja was the aggressor. “Because of the son we had raised and the type of character he had, we knew ... it wasn’t our Corey.”

The families of both Raja and Jones had packed Circuit Judge Joseph Marx’s courtroom, but there was hushed silence as Marx pronounced sentence. He could have given Raja a life term, a sentence prosecutors sought.

“This has been a heartbreaking case,” Marx said. “I think it has had a profound effect on every single person who sat through this trial.”

Raja’s wife, Karine, had sought leniency so her husband could be a father to their two young children. She said the media and others had unfairly portrayed him as “a monster, the angel of death.” Raja, in blue jail jumpsuit, looked down often as she spoke.

“The wrong person was chosen to be a sacrificial lamb,” she said. “Raja is the man you wanted serving and protecting you.” His attorneys vow to appeal.

Prosecutors contended Raja escalated a seemingly routine interaction into a deadly confrontation with Jones, a housing inspector and part-time drummer. Raja’s attorneys argued his actions were in self-defense both for a police officer and under Florida’s controversial “stand your ground” law.

Raja, of Asian descent, was in plain clothes for an auto burglary investigation team when he spotted Jones’ SUV at 3:15 a.m. on Oct. 18, 2015. Jones was headed home from a nightclub performance by his reggae band when his vehicle stalled on a dark highway off-ramp. He had a concealed-weapons permit and carried a handgun, purchased days earlier to protect his $10,000 drum set, which was in the SUV.

Raja, wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a baseball cap, drove an unmarked van the wrong way up an off ramp within feet of the SUV.

Prosecutors said Raja never identified himself as an officer and acted so aggressively Jones must have thought he was about to be carjacked or killed. Raja’s supervisor testified the officer had been told to don a police vest if he approached a civilian. He didn’t, nor did he pull his badge.

What police didn’t know at first was that Jones had been talking to a tow-truck dispatcher on a recorded line. That recording shows Jones saying “Huh?” as his door opens. Raja yells, “You good?” Jones says he is. Raja replies twice, “Really?” with Jones replying “Yeah.”

Suddenly, Raja shouts at Jones to raise his hands, using an expletive. Jones replies, “Hold on!” and Raja repeats his demand.

Prosecutors believe Jones pulled his gun and tried to run. Raja fired three shots; Jones ran down an embankment. Prosecutors said he threw his gun, but Raja fired three more times, 10 seconds after the first volley. One of the bullets pierced the man’s heart. Jones was also hit in both arms.

Prosecutors said Raja, not knowing of the audio recording, sought to deceive investigators. He claimed he said “Police, can I help you?” as Jones jumped from the SUV. He also told them Jones leapt backward and pointed his gun, forcing him to fire. Raja said Jones ran but turned and again pointed his gun, forcing him to fire the second volley.

Prosecutors charged Raja with manslaughter, saying his actions created the confrontation and showed “culpable negligence.” They also charged him with attempted murder, saying no matter which of Raja’s six shots killed Jones, the second volley was a conscious effort to kill the fleeing man.

The last Florida officer sentenced for an on-duty killing was Miami’s William Lozano in 1989. The Hispanic officer fatally shot a black motorcyclist who he said tried to hit him. A passenger died when the motorcycle crashed. Three days of rioting followed.

Convicted of two manslaughter counts in a Miami trial and sentenced to seven years, Lozano never served time. State appellate court justices dismissed the verdict, saying the case should have been moved from Miami because of racial tensions. Lozano was acquitted at a 1993 retrial in Orlando.

780,Dericka Lindsay's adopted mom stands trial in her death,"Grace Smith suffered severe diabetes, and sometimes the 69-year-old's legs and feet got so swollen she couldn't wear shoes or walk around her own house.

In her condition, Smith was weaker than her 9-year-old adopted daughter, the woman's attorney said, and sometimes she asked for help keeping the ""unruly girl"" under control.

Smith never intended or imagined that her attempts at discipline would lead to the child's death, Smith's attorney argued in the first day of her trial Thursday.

Smith is charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child and aggravated child abuse in connection with the October 2017 death of Dericka Chavonne Lindsey, a young girl who suffocated when her 320-pound cousin, Veronica Posey, sat on her as a form of discipline.

Veronica Posey: Woman convicted of murder, sentenced to life for sitting on child

James Smith: Man sentenced in death of adopted 9-year-old who was sat on

In her opening statements to jurors Thursday, Assistant State Attorney Amy Shea said Posey was charged with murder for what she did to Dericka, but Smith was being charged because ""she failed to do her duty as a parent and protect her child from the abuse of another person.""

Shea said that before Dericka's death, the child had threatened Grace Smith and her husband, James, with a knife and a hammer. Smith called Posey over to her Navy Point home, and when she arrived both women spanked Dericka using a belt, a ruler and a small pipe.

When the girl resisted, she was made to kneel on the floor with her torso bent forward over the seat of an arm chair, and Posey put her weight on the girl's torso. A minute or two into the ""punishment,"" Dericka said she couldn't breathe, but Posey didn't move. A little while later Dericka repeated that she couldn't breathe, and Posey got up, but at that point Dericka had already lost her pulse.

A later autopsy revealed that Lindsey had severe bruising on her buttocks that appeared to be the result of severe, repeated beatings. The medical examiner said during Posey's trial that the bruising was the worst of its type she had ever seen.

Shea said the discipline meted out against Dericka ""goes far beyond what punishment is permitted by the law,"" and she noted that although Smith was frail, ""that doesn't stop her from beating that child, and it doesn't stop her from inviting (Posey's) abuse into her home.""

Case unfolds

Initial arrest: Pensacola child dies after 325-pound adult sat on her as punishment

Charges upgraded: State upgrades charges for 2 allegedly involved in child's punishment death

Autopsy: Lindsay had bruising, brain swelling after cousin allegedly sat on her

Additional charges: Three defendants face additional child abuse charge

Audio: 911 call released from Dericka Lindsay death

Smith's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Bradley Rowe, said that Smith and her husband had been caring for Dericka for most of the girl's life and they loved her dearly. But while the Smiths was getting older and weaker, Dericka was ""getting bigger, stronger and more defiant everyday,"" he said.

Rowe said the couple trusted Posey to help them discipline Dercika because she was an evangelical minister who had children of her own, and sometimes she was able to get the 9-year-old to behave just by using the right words.

► Dericka Lindsay death: Parents, friends say girl with troubled home life was happy, bubbly

When she did resort to corporal punishment, the Smiths never thought Dericka would come to any real harm, Rowe suggested. He said the incident involving Posey and the chair happened so quickly that the Smiths didn't understand the tragic consequences until it was already too late.

""(Posey did not sit on Dericka) at the direction, encouragement, recommendation or order of Grace (Smith),"" Rowe told jurors. ""... She loved her daughter. She didn't want her daughter to die.""

Smith's trial is expected to wrap up Friday.

James Smith, who was also charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child, plead no contest to his charges and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. A jury convicted Posey of first-degree murder, and she was issued the mandatory life sentence for her role in the death.

781,"ECSO: Nine malnourished dogs found living in squalor, owner arrested","A Century man was arrested this week after investigators allegedly found nine malnourished dogs at his home that were chained and caged in sordid conditions.

Melvin Manuel Jr., 34, was arrested on nine counts of animal abandonment and booked into the Escambia County Jail on Monday. His bond was set at $9,000.

According to his arrest report, an investigator was dispatched Jan. 2 to 280 Hilltop Road in Century. Manuel's father, the property owner, showed the investigator the backyard.

""I could see several malnourished dogs that were on chains as well as several dogs that were kept in pens that were filled with feces and urine,"" the investigator wrote in the arrest report. ""Dogs had fresh wounds as well as old scars on heads and backs.""

All of the bowls and drinking water were full of algae, the report stated. The dogs, which were unlicensed and not vaccinated, were on chains.

The father asked if the family needed to contact his son, and the investigator said yes, the report stated. Once Manuel arrived home, the investigator walked with him through the backyard and explained why each dog was going to be taken and moved to a shelter, according to the report.

According to the arrest report, the investigator found the following dogs at the property:

The first dog was a tan, female pit bull mix named Banana Peel. Like most of the other dogs, her pen was filled with feces and urine. Her water was non-potable, and her feet were covered in feces and urine.

The second dog, Angus, was a black, male pit bull mix with scars on his face and arms and he was trying to get through the wires that kept him caged.

Diva was a black, female pit bull mix with ""extremely"" long, unkempt nails.

The fourth dog, Molly, had a puppy with her. Molly weighed 40.41 pounds, but her puppy weighed 4.21 pounds. The investigator wrote in the arrest report, ""No potable water for momma and no water for puppy. Dogs have extremely long nails and feet are covered in feces and urine, because they cannot get out of pen away from it.""

The fifth dog did not have a name, but its living conditions mirrored those of the others.

Midnight Train was a black, female pit bull mix with a ""thick"" chain attached to her ""thick"" collar.

Heavy Metal, had hair loss on his head, neck and back.

Lucille was thin enough that her protruding ribs, spine and pelvic bones could be seen from a distance.

The ninth dog was named Judy. She was taken to the shelter with the rest of the animals.

All nine animals were seized Jan. 2, and as of Thursday afternoon, the dogs remained under the care of Escambia County Animal Services, according to Joy Tsubooka, spokeswoman for the county.

Manuel posted bond the day after he was booked into jail and was released from custody at 2:02 a.m. Tuesday.

782,NASA is using the same space suits astronauts wore 30 years ago. Experts say that needs to change.,"When astronauts Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson conducted the space shuttle program’s first spacewalk in 1983, they probably wouldn’t have imagined their spacesuits would still be in use on the International Space Station some 36 years later.

Not only are they still in use but the suits, intended to last 15 years, are currently the only ones available for astronauts whizzing around Earth at thousands of miles per hour.

Now, as NASA prepares to head back to the moon, the agency must scramble to develop a next-generation suit or the next American astronauts will be forced to don some hand-me-down, 1980s equipment.

Sure, the suits get updated after six years in orbit or 25 spacewalks, but with outdated technology and only a limited quantity available, the fact of the matter is the nearly 40-year-old suits NASA employs will not serve the needs of future moonwalkers.

The current spacesuits are expected to last until 2028 – four years after NASA hopes to land astronauts on the moon again.But a series of incidents and issues from the spacesuits, like the all-female spacewalk cancellation in March caused by a lack of available suits, suggests the need for change is more urgent.

NASA has known for a while that it needs to update its spacesuits. The agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel reiterated the urgency to develop the next-generation suit during a meeting last month.

In 2017, a similar report by NASA's inspector general came to the same conclusion and stated ""the agency remains years away from having a flight-ready spacesuit capable of replacing the EMU or suitable for use on future exploration missions.""

EMUs, or Extravehicular Mobility Units, are the current suits used on the ISS.

Considered to be a “mini spacecraft” in itself, the spacesuit astronauts currently wear to survive the harsh environment of space is complex and requires major modifications based on the user.

""The EMU, of course, is very bulky. It's a big, bulky, awkward suit to work in,"" former NASA astronaut Winston Scott told FLORIDA TODAY. ""But your life depends on it. It is a totally self-contained life support system.""

Since the retirement of the shuttle program in 2011, ""NASA has had limited ability to return the EMUs from the ISS because only one of the commercial vehicles that ferry supplies to the station has the capability to return items to Earth,"" according to the inspector general's report.

""As a result, astronauts are using the EMUs for much longer periods of time between maintenance and refurbishment than originally intended,"" the report reads.

And only 11 of the 18 ""EMU Primary Life Support System units,"" backpack-like structures required to keep astronauts alive when conducting spacewalks, are still in use. Five were destroyed in the Challenger and Columbia disasters as well as the SpaceX cargo mission that broke apart in 2015. Another was lost during ground testing and the last was built for certification only and is not suitable for flight.

NASA has had years to develop a next-generation spacesuit, but a ""lack of a formal plan and specific destinations for future missions has complicated spacesuit development,"" the report noted.

Starting in 2005 with the establishment of the Constellation program, which called for the development of a suite of vehicles to take astronauts back to the moon and beyond, NASA has spent almost $200 million on three spacesuit development efforts.

On May 1, NASA said on Twitter there would be a ""transition suit"" for the first mission to return to the moon that would include modern designs for astronauts to explore the lunar surface. As to what those advancements will be or what the transition suit will entail, the agency is still unsure.

""We’re looking at internal and external options for a transition spacesuit for the Moon 2024 landing with American astronauts as well as options for modern spacesuits for sustainable surface missions,"" NASA spokeswoman Cheryl Warner said.

Possible future spacesuits

As part of 18 studies being funded by NASA, the SmartSuit project would be an intelligent suit that would increase human performance and allow astronauts to travel to other celestial bodies like the moon and Mars. (Photo: NASA)

On the local front, Florida Institute of Technology academics has their own ideas on how to upgrade NASA's spacesuits.

In 2016, Ondrej Doule, director and founder of the university's Human Spaceflight Laboratory, along with students and team members, won the grand prize for their design of the interior of a single-person spacecraft in the Genesis Engineering Solutions competition.

The ""Wholly Human Integrated Single Person Spacecraft"" could replace the current spacesuits, Doule said. Instead of modeling the single-person spacecraft to look like a suit, the device would essentially become a mini-spacecraft with robotic arms and would have enough room for one astronaut.

Not only could any astronaut perform spacewalks regardless of their body shape, the walks would also be safer to perform because the robotic arms would do all the repairs needed outside of the space station instead of the actual astronauts, Doule said.

Though NASA does not know what the next spacesuit will look like, the agency is casting a wide net in its search.

As part of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, the agency is funding 18 studies, one of which includes the development of a ""SmartSuit,"" an intelligent suit designed with self-healing skin and data collection for spacewalks in extreme environments, NASA said last month.

The SmartSuit could be used to travel to other celestial bodies like the moon and Mars, and will incorporate ""soft-robotics technology that allows astronauts to be highly mobile and better interact with their surroundings,"" according to the release.

The $125,000 project, however, is only in the first phase and can only receive additional funding after successful studies and a transition to the second phase.

Scott, who conducted three spacewalks in NASA's current spacesuit, has his own wishes for how future suits should operate.

""An ideal spacesuit would be one that you don't even think about while you're wearing it,"" Scott said. ""So that means the suit would be light. It would fit you, it wouldn't be big and bulky.""

Instead of inhibiting movement, vision or restricting the astronaut in any way, Scott hopes for a much lighter, tighter-fit suit that still protects the astronaut. He also wouldn't mind an ""Iron Man"" version of a spacesuit.

""Perhaps the suit will be smaller and lighter than what we have, but maybe with some human assist functions like some robotics inside the suit to help you move,"" Scott said. ""Like the suits we develop for our military, the super soldier suits. Like the real version of Iron Man.""

Current suits won't work for deep space missions

With the race back on to send humans to the moon again by 2024, why won't the current spacesuits work if they've already been approved to last until 2028?

According to the inspector general's report, spacesuit requirements vary for each mission. A spacesuit designed for the moon has different needs than one for Mars since ""each destination has different temperatures, radiation levels, pressures, mobility requirements, and exposure to dust and debris.""

Though the current spacesuits are sufficient for use aboard the space station, it won't suffice for deep space exploration missions.

""For example, the current EMU lacks the hip and flexibility needed to walk on and explore planetary surfaces,"" the report reads.

Typically, spacesuits are designed with the mission in mind.

Custom-fit suits were made specifically for astronauts of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions. But with the shuttle program, NASA took a different approach.

As the astronaut class grew larger, it became too expensive to custom-tailor each suit to each astronaut. Instead, NASA’s current suits are a combination of several detachable parts that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

This allows multiple astronauts to wear the same suit, something the agency has done since the 1980s. But that's not to say they haven't come with their own sets of issues.

Past incidents and current issues

CLOSE Astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch were to make landmark history, but NASA canceled it keeping their safety in mind before anything else. USA TODAY

In March, NASA was planning the first all-female spacewalkwith astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch. But a lack of readily available spacesuits aboard the space station prevented a historic event from occurring.

With limited sizes available, sometimes astronauts — usually females — cannot perform spacewalks due to sizing issues with available spacesuits, NASA design engineer Elizabeth Benson said in a 2009 paper named ""Complexity of Sizing for Space Suit Applications.""

This was essentially the problem with the planned all-female spacewalk – both McClain and Koch required mediums, but there was only one on board that would be ready in time, NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz said.

A simple solution would have been making more sizes available, but due to high costs, NASA had to downgrade the options to only medium, large and extra large sizes, preventing smaller astronauts from wearing the suits and conducting spacewalks.

And if limited sizing and quantity weren't already issues, according to NASA, a spacesuit weighs approximately 280 pounds on the ground. In space, it may not weigh anything, but that still doesn't mean astronauts aren't carrying around all that mass, Scott said.

""Its bulk makes it difficult to work in and some of the smaller stature people or some of the weaker physical people can't manipulate the suit,"" Scott said. ""And of course, they may or may not be able to conduct a spacewalk.""

Kathryn Sullivan, the first American woman to perform a spacewalk in 1985, had her own issues with the suit. In an interview with Outside Magazine in April, Sullivan explained how the suit never fit her correctly.

""The suit's knee was a bit above mine,"" she told the magazine. ""Every time I needed to bend, I wasn't bending a natural joint.""

Astronaut Linda Godwin also told the magazine the shoulders of the spacesuit were the biggest issue.

The suits were initially designed to fit a wide variety of both women and men, but that changed after the agency cut back in sizes.

Astronaut Peggy Whitson, who holds the American record for time spent in space, said in a documentary interview: ""As a woman, doing spacewalks is more challenging, mostly because the suits are sized bigger than the average female.""

So why is this a big deal?

As men and women of different shapes and sizes join NASA's astronaut corps, a poorly fitted suit not only prevents certain astronauts from conducting spacewalks, but ""can also increase the effort that a wearer must exert to move in the suit, since their joints are not lined up with the suit joints,"" Benson said.

""Also, a poorly fit suit has the potential to actually impinge on the wearer during motion and lead to a reduction in mobility and risk of injury,"" she said.

In space, astronauts are essentially floating within their pressurized spacesuit, Scott said. Because the suit is pressurized, which basically means the suit is inflated like a balloon, a common problem astronauts find when wearing the suit is the ability to bend their joints.

""Imagine you're trying to reach for a tool in space and you're reaching to wrap your fingers around the tool. When you try to close and open your fingers, your suit is working against you because it's pressurized,"" Scott said.

In fact, since they were designed in the 1970s, there have been more than 3,400 anomalies with the current spacesuits, according to the inspector general's report. They range from a loose boot thread to glove damage, uncomfortable body temperatures and helmet water intrusions.

Such was the case in 2013 when European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano reported water, a little over a third of a gallon, in his helmet while conducting a spacewalk. A similar instance occurred again in 2016 with NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra. Both spacewalks were terminated early.

None of the incidents that occurred during spacewalks have resulted in deaths or serious injuries, and only five were terminated early. But that's not to say a new spacesuit isn't necessary for future space exploration.

""As we go forward in space, we need to figure out ways to build suits that provide the protection that you need,"" Scott said. ""But also that are lighter and more flexible and better able to allow a person to work in them.""

785,"Drug bust: Estero couple face drug trafficking charges, meth, fentanyl found during traffic stop","CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Lee County on news-press.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

A couple from Estero are facing multiple charges involving trafficking and possession of drugs including methamphetamine, Fentanyl and Xanax.

786,"Marco Island police chief search down to 12, includes local candidates","The recruitment process has begun to find the next Marco Island police chief. (Photo: Submitted)

The first cut in the Marco Island police chief search has dwindled the candidate list from 81 to 12.

Eight of the 12 remaining candidates looking to replace outgoing Police Chief Al Schettino reside in Florida, including a few local candidates.

The 12 candidates are:

Asst. Chief John Barkley, Naples Police Department

Deputy Chief Jerry Connolly, Haines City Police Department

Captain John Crane-Baker, Delray Beach Police Department

Deputy Chief Tracy Frazzano, Montclair (N.J.) Police Department

Chief Anthony Giaimo, Florida Southwestern College Police Department

Captain Tina Heysler, Village of Palm Springs Police Department

Deputy Chief Michael Kreher, Atlanta Police Department

Deputy Chief Stephen McCosker, Ocoee Police Department

Deputy Chief Joseph Penze, Village of Niles (Ill.) Police Department

Assistant Chief Terrence Pierce, Gainesville Police Department

Retired Chief Tomas Sanchez, Hollywood Police Department

Chief Timothy Sheehan, Tewksbury (Ma.) Police Department

The candidates that survived the first cut will now complete a questionnaire before the next round of cuts names 4-8 finalists for the position.

During Monday's City Council meeting, City Manager David Harden said he hoped to have that short list by the council's May 20 meeting, which Florida Police Chiefs Association Executive Director Amy Mercer said was a possibility.

More: Marco Island police chief intends to retire June 15

The vacancy in the department was created in February after Schettino issued a letter on Feb. 21 announcing his retirement.

As more details came to light, it was revealed that his retirement was not of his choosing as Harden had originally requested his resignation after another embarrassing incident hit the police department.

In 2018, three members of the department were found to have had sex on duty, resulting in two of them tendering their resignations and another being terminated from the force. A fourth officer that knew about one of the officer's actions but didn't report it was reprimanded only to be promoted months later.

The woman involved with all of the officers has also announced her intention to sue the city for damages resulting from the negligence in hiring, retaining and supervising the offending officers.

The last straw, however, came when a high profile incident in which a man barricaded himself in his home with a cache of weapons, drawing a response from SWAT, could not be prosecuted due to the involvement of a Marco Island officer.

Despite the State Attorney's Office refusing for years to use Officer Tige Thompson as a witness in any criminal trials due to his tarnished credibility, he had remained on patrol during Schettino's watch.

In lieu of resigning, Schettino proposed retiring from the department on June 15, which was accepted by Harden.

Although Harden had originally believed the department could have a new police chief in place by that date, Mercer said Wednesday that she was not sure whether that would be feasible.

""I do believe they can possibly name their new chief by then but I am not sure if someone can begin that early due to backgrounds and having to give notice for their current position,"" Mercer said.

Once finalists are named, they will be invited to Marco Island for interviews and to participate in assessment exercises.

What that will look like has yet to be determined, Mercer said.

""We will work with the City Manager on determining the onsite process,"" Mercer said. ""Nothing has been finalized or discussed at this point in the process. However, those talks will begin shortly.""

Mollie Tibbetts’ mother, in her first television interview since authorities made an arrest in her daughter’s kidnapping and murder, asked the public to donate to a cause incredibly important to the Iowa college student.Tibbetts would have turned 21 years old Wednesday. In her honor, family members said they hope individuals will donate $21 to Mollie’s Movement, a fundraiser set up for the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital’s pediatric and adolescent psychiatric unit. Authorities said Tibbetts, a Brooklyn native attending the University of Iowa, vanished while out for a run in her hometown July 18, 2018. Her body was found about a month later in a rural Poweshiek County cornfield not far from where she was last seen jogging. About two months later, a former Iowa State star golfer, Celia Barquin Arozamena, was stabbed to death while playing a round near campus, police said. “We know about the tragic event in Ames right after,” said Laura Calderwood, Tibbetts’ mother. “Part of what I learned from that is this man had been suffering from mental illness … since he was a child. My thought was, ‘What if someone would have helped him as a child to work with his issues, and could that have been prevented?’” Those wishing to donate may do so online or at participating businesses in Iowa City or Des Moines. Calderwood said her family hopes individuals will donate $21 to the Mollie Tibbetts Memorial Fund, which benefits the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital’s pediatric and adolescent psychiatric unit.In KCCI’s interview with Calderwood, she reacted to the suspected killer’s arrest and explained what gave her the most peace when she learned what happened to her daughter.

789,"DCPS officer, his stepfather face child sex charges involving same girl","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A police lieutenant with Duval County Public Schools who was arrested Tuesday is facing child sex charges for an incident involving a young girl, News4Jax has learned.

As if that wasn't disturbing enough, the Michigan Attorney General's Office said the man's stepfather is facing the same charges -- involving the same child.

Authorities did not release the child's exact age or her relationship to the two men.

Lt. Sean MacMaster, 45, is charged with two counts of criminal conduct with a child, which is a first-degree felony. He was taken into custody on the out-of-state arrest warrant at the Duval County School Police Department. He was set to go before a judge Wednesday afternoon.

MacMaster's stepfather, Larry Orr, who is a registered sex offender in Michigan, is facing the same charges. He was arraigned in Oakland County Superior Court on Thursday and is being held without bond.

A statement from a Duval County Public Schools spokesperson reads in part:

We have received notification that an employee with the Duval County School Police Department, Lt. Sean MacMaster, was arrested (Tuesday) morning on an out of state warrant. The charges are not related to the school district or any student in the district. However, the district is closely monitoring this situation. The individual is currently in custody. Should he be released from custody, he will not have any contact with students pending the outcome of an internal investigation.

It wasn't immediately clear which school MacMaster worked at.

A woman who was at the home of MacMaster's listed address told News4Jax, ""We don't have any comment.""

791,"Seminole burglary suspect crashes into patrol vehicle, deputies say","SEMINOLE COUNTY, Fla. - A man wanted in connection with a home burglary on Friday crashed into a patrol vehicle and several others while attempting to avoid arrest on Tuesday, according to the Seminole County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies announced Friday that they were searching for Daquon Atkins after a homeowner reported returning to the residence on Virginia Avenue around 1:15 p.m. to find two people inside the home.

A search was conducted in the area but Atkins was not found, according to authorities.

On Tuesday morning, deputies were on Windtree Court in Sanford when they said they saw Atkins enter a Kia Optima. Authorities activated the lights on their patrol vehicles to get Atkins to stop, but he sped off, hitting his tire on the curb and three other vehicles, according to the affidavit.

Atkins struck a patrol vehicle that was attempting to block him on Windchase Boulevard and continued until he was blocked by a second vehicle at the front entrance of the housing complex, the report said.

He was arrested on an armed burglary warrant as well as another open warrant and fleeing and eluding and leaving the scene of a crash charges.

793,Boating accident victim reunites with those who saved his life,"<p>A South Florida man went to Jackson Memorial Hospital on Wednesday morning to reunite with the people who saved his life last year after a boating accident on Father's Day.</p>

<p>""This one really hit home for me on a personal level because I am a boater and I was out there with my kids,"" Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Lt. Terrance Dolan said. </p>

<p>The accident is a Father's Day connection that Dolan and Jonathan Cruz will share forever. </p>

<p>Cruz was out on the water with his twins and his wife at Elliot Key last June when a nearby boater asked for help getting off a sandbar. As Cruz got close to the boat, someone accidentally turned it on and put it in gear.</p>

<p>""I wasn't behind the boat yet. I was still a couple feet away -- probably like 2 or 3 feet away -- and then I just remember getting sucked in,"" Cruz said. </p>

<p>Dolan was nearby on a boat with his family. He heard the screams, grabbed an emergency bag and headed out to help.</p>

<p>""We took a bunch of dry beach towels, packed it up and then tied it as tight as we could to stop the bleeding as much as possible,"" Dolan said. ""And then, at that time, luckily I had an IV, and I started an IV on him.""</p>

<p>By starting an IV and reducing blood loss, Dolan kept Cruz alive until he could be airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.</p>

<p>""This injury took place in the water, and so there is a high risk for infection that adds to the insult from the initial traumatic injury,"" Dr. Joyce Kaufman said. </p>

<p>Kaufman led the team that kept Cruz in a coma for three weeks and performed 30 surgeries followed by intense therapy. Though his leg and pelvis were severely injured, the medical team that worked on him see him as a miracle.</p>

<p>""It was very traumatic, even for me, because it was just a lot. I felt very emotional afterward,"" Dolan said.   </p>

<p>""I was blessed,"" Cruz said. ""You know, I was blessed to be here.""</p>

<p>Cruz still has multiple surgeries ahead of him. A <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/swaw6-jonathan-cruz"">GoFundMe page</a> has been created to help him and his family during their time of need. </p>

794,Thief caught on camera burglarizing cupcake shop in Miramar,"MIRAMAR, Fla. - A cupcake shop owner has only been in business for a little over a year, but she told Local 10 News she is now out close to $1,000 after a thief broke into her shop over the weekend after she had closed for the day.

Surveillance video outside Sweetgem Cupcakes in Miramar shows the moments a crook is seen popping the lock on the front door before making his way inside the business.

The owner, Jessica Castro, said she closed her doors just after 6 p.m. Saturday.

""I looked at my phone and I saw the person on my cameras -- a guy inside here,"" Castro said.

The video shows the thief making his way behind the counter, breaking into a petty cash box and then making away with two tablets, disregarding surveillance cameras watching his every move.

""My door is locked. Everyone's been knocking today,"" Castro said. ""Yeah, it's scary.""

Castro said the man had come in to her shop just an hour before the break-in. She said he never made a purchase, but was just looking around, almost as if to see what he could come back for and steal when she left.

""He says, 'Oh, I just wanted to see what you sold,'"" Castro said.

Miramar police are seen in the video responding to Castro's security alarm, but the thief had already made his getaway.

Anyone with information about the thief's identity is asked to call Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477.

795,Osceola deputy ticketed in crash that killed man,"OSCEOLA COUNTY, Fla. - Citations will be issued to an Osceola County Sheriff's Office deputy who caused a chain-reaction crash that killed a 34-year-old man in October, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

Deputy Gloria Boccio will be ticketed for careless driving and failure to wear a seat belt, troopers said.

Troopers said Boccio was driving a marked Dodge Charger patrol car around 8 a.m. Oct. 5 eastbound on U.S. 192 when, for an unknown reason, she failed to slow down to accommodate for traffic stopped at a red light.

Boccio's car slammed into the back of a Ford pickup truck driven by Robert Johnston, the report said. The force of the crash pushed Johnston's truck into a Dodge Van, which then hit a Ford Focus, according to authorities.

Johnston died at an area hospital. His family received $200,000 from the county in January as part of a settlement.

Boccio was not injured. She claimed in a call to the Sheriff's Office after the crash that her brakes malfunctioned, but data retrieved from her patrol car indicated she might have sped up before the impact.

After the crash, Boccio was placed on paid administrative leave.

In November, she was reassigned to a role that does not require her to drive a patrol vehicle after authorities said she caused a second crash. In that instance, troopers said Boccio was driving on State Road 417 on Nov. 6 when she failed to slow down and had to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle in front of her, which then caused a crash between the patrol vehicle and a truck in another lane.

A Mini Cooper and a Volkswagen were also involved.

No one was injured. Boccio was ticketed for an improper lane change.

Troopers said Tuesday that the investigation into the fatal crash has concluded and they do not expect any charges to be filed.

ACCORDING TO THE RUTGERS CENTER FOR AMERICAN WOMEN IN POLITICS, VOTER TURN OUT FOR WOMEN HAS OUT PACED MEN IN EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE 1980, AND THEY VOTED AT HIGHER RATES IN THE 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS AS WELL. ALL AGE GROUPS SAW A BOOST IN NUMBERS, BUT TURN OUT INCREASED THE MOST AMONG WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18-24. SHE IS A SENIOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, AND ALLISON IS A JUNIOR AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. NICE TO HAVE YOU. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF POLITICALLY? >> SURE. SO I AM A REGISTERED REPRESENT, BUT I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO DEFINE MYSELF AS MORE OF A MILLENNIAL DEFINITION OF THAT. I REMEMBER -- SOLEDAD: WHAT IS A MILLENNIAL DEFINITION OF A REGISTERED REPUBLICAN? >> THANK YOU FOR ASKING. I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SIGNED UP AS A REPRESENT, AND IT WAS ME AND MY FAMILY WHO WERE SITTING THERE IN OUR AUDITORIUM IN FLORIDA. WE WERE THINKING WE DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE DIRECTION THE REPRESENT PARTY IS GOING IN. BUT IF THERE IS ONE PERSON THAT CAN PUSH THE PARTY TO THE RIGHT, THEN THERE IS ONE THAT CAN PUSH IT MORE TOWARD THE LEFT, AS WE WANT TO SEE. SOLEDAD: ALLISON, YOU ARE A JUNIOR, YOU HAVE FOCUSED A LOT ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN. WHERE ARE YOU? >> I AM A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT. FEMALE DOMINATED HOME BY MY MOTHER, WHO IS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT WOMEN'S ADVOCACY, WOMEN'S WORK, IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT SHAPED MY IDEA OF WHAT IS FAIR, WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT WOMEN DESERVE. SOLEDAD: AND WHAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND? WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? >> I AM FROM STANFORD, CONNECTICUT. MY MOTHER IS FROM EAST COAST TEX. MY FATHER IS COLOMBIAN.

BUT IT IS ABOUT GETTING THE WOMEN IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RUN. ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS PEOPLE DON'T RUN, THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE THEM UP THERE. FOR ME IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO SEE A WOMAN BE AT THE TOP OF A CONTINGENT JUST BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION TO HAVE THAT CHANCE AND SAY I COULD DO THAT TOO ONE DAY. SOLEDAD: WHEN YOU THINK THAT WE ABOUT THIS HISTORY? HOW DO YOU VIEW IT? >> IT SPEAKS TO WHAT OUR NATION IS. WOMEN WHO IS SUCCESSED IN WHAT THEY EP INTENDED TO DO.

805,A mother's greatest gift: passing down the embarrassment,"Mary Carr (from left), with her daughter, Cynthia Carr Falardeau, and niece Susan Cobb McGowen, at a family gathering in 1979. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO FROM CYNTHIA FALARDEAU)

My 16-year-old son, Wyatt, has a constant complaint: “Mom! You are so embarrassing!”

To which I always reply, “You have no idea! I learned from the best!”

Which begs the question: Is being embarrassing hereditary?

Twenty-years ago, my mother came for a visit. During that week we laughed, cried and finally resolved many conflicts. The last night, she thanked my husband, Jim, and I, for “The best week ever!”

The next day she died of a massive stroke.

Heaven gained God’s best party girl, children’s advocate, community volunteer and mother to anyone who showed up for Sunday dinner. Finding a way to heal, I vowed to carry on her legacy and begin anew. I quit my job and began my own quest to become a mother.

It is less about what she taught me and more about the mother I have become.

This story begins with semantics.

For example, I believe I am my son’s best advocate. He calls it, “Yelling at my teachers!” Like any typical teenager, he exaggerates. Maintaining communication with his teachers equates to being loud in a juvenile mind.

In the eighth grade, my Home Economics teacher, Mrs. Uzzle, gave us the assignment to create a piece of clothing. I followed a Butterfield pattern to make a plaid wrap skirt. My mother was infuriated that my seams were not straight.

To avoid the teacher’s review, I wore the skirt to school and earned an A-plus. Upon hearing this, my mother hauled over to Hadley E. Watt’s Middle School and asked for my teacher to reconsider the grade she gave me. To which I say, “Who does that?”

Learning to network was a close second to advocacy. Mom was always the Girl Scout leader. My friends thought she was “cool.” Somewhere between her wild clothes, big sunglasses and platform shoes, they knew that she was all about “girl power.”

One summer, our troupe planned a bike ride through a nearby town. It was a very hot day. The girls asked my mom if we could stop for ice cream. I knew my mom did not have any money. However, she brightly replied, “Yes, I think we can make that happen!”

The next thing I know, we are all walking into a bank. My mother confidently asks to speak to the branch manager. I am mortified by what I think is going to happen. She meets the man, extends a firm handshake and asks for a short-term loan. The man looks over my 10 friends and me, pauses for a moment, and says, “I think we can make that happen!”

Who goes to a town where they don’t live, to a bank they don’t use, and gets ice cream for kids? Later she would quip, “I was just trying to teach you that anything is possible.”

Growing up, especially as a teenager, I would beg my mother to dress “normal.” Somewhere between her belly-dancing phase and mid-life crisis came the influence of J.R. Ewing, played by actor Larry Hagman. Mind you, we lived in a conservative suburb of Centerville, Ohio. This was a long way from the home of her favorite TV show, “Dallas.”

I remember wanting desperately to be invisible when I was in pubic with her. Years later, she traded this look for wearing Birkenstocks with a fur coat. This was only seconded by her exercising in a Mickey Mouse sports bra. Her reply was always, “Life is too short to not express yourself.”

My mother’s colorful influence remains a constant presence in my life. Wyatt recently summed it up best, “A mom is the spirit of your heart.”

Despite my smother tendencies, perhaps he, too, knows my love is true.”

Cynthia Falardeau is chief executive officer of the Education Foundation of Indian River County. She lives in Vero Beach, Florida with her husband, Jim, and their son, Wyatt.

807,"Trump pledges help for Panhandle, Tyndall AFB","- President Donald Trump on Wednesday vowed Tyndall Air Force Base will be rebuilt after sustaining massive damage in Hurricane Michael, and he will approve the state’s request to boost federal funding for storm recovery in Northwest Florida.

Trump, during a campaign rally in Panama City Beach, said the federal reimbursement levels for hurricane recovery in the region will be boosted from 75 percent to 90 percent “in many circumstances.”

“We will never, ever leave your side,” Trump said following chants of “USA” and “four more years” from a crowd at the Aaron Bessant Park Amphitheater. “We’ve already given you billions of dollars, and there is a lot more coming.”

He said $448 million has been approved by his administration for housing disaster recovery assistance.

Trump’s comments came as he and Senate Republicans are locked in a battle with Democrats over how much of a stalled federal disaster-relief package should go to Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017. Delays in the relief package have frustrated Panhandle officials and residents.

Hurricane Michael devastated parts of the region after it made landfall Oct. 10 in Mexico Beach, east of Panama City. Gov. Ron DeSantis requested increased federal assistance after the storm was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane on April 19.

Panama City Mayor Greg Brudnicki told WJHG Newschannel 7 it’s “encouraging” to get a promise of increased federal funding and the restoration of Tyndall.

“We know if they’re going to rebuild Tyndall, they have to rebuild Mexico Beach, they have to rebuild Panama City and all the rest of the municipalities around it because we support Tyndall,” Brudnicki said. “It’s 30 percent of our economy, and 90 percent of the people that work at Tyndall live in our cities. So we know if they’re going to rebuild Tyndall, we’re going to get the appropriations to rebuild all our cities and the county.”

Trump’s rally followed a tour of Tyndall. He was joined by DeSantis, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, both Florida Republicans.

“I really believe Northwest Florida is going to come back stronger than ever before,” DeSantis told the crowd.

The Air Force has already spent $450 million rebuilding Tyndall, where about 700 structures were damaged as it and nearby Mexico City Beach took a direct hit from Michael, which came ashore with winds of 160 mph. However, the recovery effort effectively halted on the base on May 1 as Congress has not provided needed supplemental funding.

Trump said he kept the base from closing and reiterated an Air Force recommendation to eventually locate three squadrons of F-35 fighters at Tyndall. The recommendation was made as F-22s formerly at Tyndall were moved after the storm to Alaska, Hawaii and Virginia.

The region has received about $1.1 billion in federal aid, but that amount remains far below what officials say is needed to complete infrastructure repairs, remove debris, reduce the risks of wildfires, rebuild schools and restore businesses areas and residential communities.

“Great conversation with @realDonaldTrump on the flight to #Florida about #DisasterRelief for #HurricaneMichaelincluding support for timber, @TeamTyndall & a 90-10 federal match. optimistic that good news is on the way,” Rubio tweeted after the base tour.

Attorney General Ashley Moody, Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez and state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis were among those making opening remarks Wednesday night.

Patronis, who is from Panama City, called it a “blessing to have this much attention” from the president.

“This man could be anywhere, literally, he could be anywhere in the world today, but he’s here,” Patronis said. “And you’re being here is showing him that Northwest Florida will come back stronger than ever.”

Northwest Florida is a Republican stronghold, and Trump will need heavy support in the region as he runs for re-election next year. Before Trump arrived Wednesday, Democrats were already criticizing the president and Republicans for delays in storm response.

A Republican-sponsored proposal includes $610 million to fund a gap in Puerto Rico’s nutritional assistance program, an amount Florida Democrats called too low during a media conference call. U.S. Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., said the Democratic-led House, which approved a $14 billion relief package in February, would be willing to compromise if the Republican-run Senate could approve its own relief proposal.

Soto added Trump has inflated Puerto Rico relief numbers for political reasons.

“He continues to be overly sensitive about the failures of the administration, and his bruised ego is one of the reasons we find ourselves here today,” Soto said.

Soto noted that out of $41 billion allocated for Puerto Rico relief, $11 billion has been delivered.

Trump contended Wednesday night that money for the Panhandle recovery, as well as money for Midwest farmers recovering from flooding, Hurricane Florence victims in Georgia and the Carolinas and wildfire victims in California, is being delayed because Democrats want more for Puerto Rico.

Before departing for the Panhandle, Trump tweeted, “Getting ready to leave for one of my favorite places, the Florida Panhandle, where we’ve given, and are giving, billions of $$$ for the devastation caused by Hurricane Michael. Even though the Dems are totally in our way (they don’t want money to go there) we’re getting it done!”

Florida has already put up $1.64 billion for removing debris and providing other emergency assistance, money the state hopes to mostly recoup from the federal government.

Additionally, more than $220 million for recovery efforts was included in the state’s $91.1 billion budget that lawmakers approved Saturday.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., said during Wednesday’s Democratic conference call that the U.S. House will take up a supplemental funding bill on Friday that includes $700 million for Tyndall.

“Tyndall Air Force Base was flattened, absolutely flattened,” Wasserman Schultz said. “They should not have had to wait this long for the necessary and vital rebuilding support that they need.”",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/trump-pledges-help-for-panhandle-tyndall-afb,2019-05-09T02:06:43Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

812,Report points to need to bolster health preparedness,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - As the 2019 hurricane season looms and as hepatitis A cases continue to soar in Florida, a report issued Wednesday shows that more work needs to be done to ensure the health and safety of residents against emerging infectious diseases, terrorism and extreme weather conditions.

Florida scored a 6.7 on the 2019 National Health Security Preparedness Index, putting it on par with the national average. The report, issued by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, analyzed 129 different measures for each state and the nation. The measures are spread across six broad categories and tallied for an overall score.

Glen Mays, a professor of health policy at the University of Kentucky who worked on the index, said the information is being shared to try to improve the nation’s ability to ensure the public health and safety of citizens during disasters.

“Given that as a country we are facing more of these emergency situations, natural disasters, man-made disasters and more disease outbreaks, so raising awareness about what each state can do and where the strengths are and also where the weaknesses are, we hope that can mobilize some people to take some action,” he said. “That’s the major purpose. Because when it comes to disaster preparedness, it’s largely a voluntary effort. You’re trying to get organizations willing to work together to do their part. And this provides a way of showing where we are.”

The assessment was originally developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2013. The goal is to attain a composite score of 9, which would indicate a “strong health security level.”

Florida earned a 9 in two categories: health security surveillance and incident and information management.

Health security surveillance encompasses the ability to monitor and detect health threats and to identify where hazards start and spread so that they can be contained rapidly. Incident and information management focuses on the ability to deploy people, supplies, money and information to locations where they are most effective in protecting health.

Mays said the state’s scores in those areas are buoyed by its experiences with hurricanes. “Practice makes perfect,” he said.

Florida lags the national average in half of the six categories and outperforms the nation in the other half. For example, Mays noted Florida’s lackluster performance in community planning and engagement, which involves developing and maintaining relationships among government agencies, community organizations and households.

Florida scored a 4.8 in the category, below the national average of 5.2.

“That’s foundational to everything else you do to be prepared for disasters,” Mays said. “In that domain, we are measuring how well organizations are communicating and coordinating their activities and if they are well-positioned to kind of share information and resources to better respond when disasters strike. So it’s really critical stuff.”

The state also lagged behind in two other categories: health-care delivery and countermeasure management.

Health-care delivery focuses on the ability to ensure access to high-quality medical services across the continuum of care during and after disasters and emergencies. Mays said the state’s overall performance in the category was hindered by worse-than-average nursing home performance and mental-health access.

Mays said Florida nursing homes in 2018 had a higher-than-average number of federal citations for failing to comply with emergency preparedness plans. Moreover, he said, “a larger share of the population in the state of Florida is underserved by mental-health professionals. They are very important in helping people, particularly in the aftermath of disasters.”

Countermeasure management evaluates the ability to store and deploy health-related products and supplies that protect people from diseases and injuries. The average score nationwide was 6.5 out of 10. Florida scored 6.1.

Mays said the performance on the measurement also was due to the state’s relatively low vaccination rates for seniors and young children. Though there is growing controversy about vaccines, they are one of the best countermeasures to keep people protected from disease.

“It’s a problem nationally, but it looks like Florida may have a little more of a problem in that area,” Mays told The News Service of Florida.

The score regarding vaccinations came amid an outbreak of hepatitis A. Florida has had a reported 1,037 cases of the liver disease this year, nearly double the amount reported for all of 2018, according to numbers posted on the state Department of Health website.

Hepatitis A can be spread through such things as food or drinks that have been contaminated with fecal matter from people with the disease. Health officials have urged people to get vaccinated against the disease.

814,Circumstances of abuse involving werewolf mask not unique in Escambia County,"Videos allegedly depicted a 37-year-old man sending bursts of electricity into the 2-year-old body of a little girl, filming himself chasing her with his face hidden behind a werewolf mask as she screamed.

The extremity of the abuses that Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius is accused of committing against his live-in girlfriend’s daughter can make the details of the allegations appear unprecedented in their depravity.

But Gulf Coast Kid’s House Executive Director Stacey Kostevicki does not view the abuse allegations as being exceptionally unique.

“The bottom line is all abuse is the exertion of power and control,” Kostevicki said. “What better way to exert power and control, than to do it when a child is sleeping.”

New details: In wolf mask and Batman PJs, Pensacola man tortured child for cameras, report says

According to Kostevicki, one of the most common perpetrators of child abuse is the boyfriend of a single mother.

The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office announced last week that deputies had arrested and charged Celaius with abusing his live-in girlfriend’s 2-year-old daughter.

Sheriff David Morgan referred to Celaius' alleged abuses — which included shocking the child with an electric dog collar, shooting her with a BB gun, throwing milk bottles at her head as she nodded off to sleep and throwing a house cat on her face once she had fallen asleep — as “systematic torture.”

The specific factors, like wearing a werewolf mask, are, to say the least, uncommon. However, the case against Celaius fits a pattern of circumstances all too common in Escambia County.

Arrest: Pensacola man accused of 'systematic torture' and 'indescribable' abuse of 2-year-old

“When you move in with a person, the move provides 24-hour access to the child,” Kostevicki said.

Where the number of child abuse cases have fallen at the national level in recent years, they have risen in Escambia County, she noted.

Kostevicki speculated highly publicized abuse cases, like those involving R. Kelly and Larry Nassar, have turned into engrossing scandals that brought new awareness to child abuse. That awareness, she believes, has led to more abuse cases being reported across the country.

In Escambia County in 2018, one out of 11 children were involved in an allegation of abuse, Kostevicki said. These numbers have risen in recent years.

In 2014, one out of 14 children were involved in an allegation of abuse, according to the Department of Children and Families.

“With us, I do think poverty plays a role,” she said. “Families are more likely to move in with each other — single moms are more willing to move in with their boyfriends — if they can’t afford to live separately.”

Boyfriends of single mothers are definitely not the only perpetrators of child abuse in Escambia County. But Kostevicki said mothers moving in with significant others should be vigilant about protecting their child from any potential harm.

In 97% of child abuse cases seen by the Gulf Coast Kid's House, the abuser is a family member or a trusted family friend.

“We would advise parents, particularly moms who are considering moving in with a boyfriend, to be particularly vigilant about making sure they know that person is safe,” Kostevicki said. “If there are multiple kids in the household, be aware if the boyfriend is wanting to hang out with one of the children more than the rest or give only one of the children gifts.”

The Gulf Coast Kid’s House, along with its partners, provided services to over 3,015 children in the 2017-2018 fiscal year. Out of its 643 interviews with kids and 660 medical assessments of children, the Gulf Coast Kid’s House found indications of child abuse in 78% of its assessments.

815,Body cam released in takedown of man accused of trying to drown his son,"- Body cam video from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office shows the moments they took down and arrested Wilkens Ordena in March.

The footage shows a late-night chase ending in Orange County.

Inside the car is Wilkens Ordena, the man Orange County deputies say tried to drown his own son in a pool in March.

Fox 35 spoke with the toddler’s mother Tuesday.

The boy, Kameron, is doing just fine now.

“That’s what hurts me the most is that he had to go through it. My son is much happier. That’s what I can notice from him, that he is way happier,” said Shantia Warren, the boy's mother.

Deputies say Ordena tried to drown his nearly 2-year-old son because he was angry his father was babysitting him that night.

After family members rescued the boy from the pool, Ordena drove off, crashed into deputies’ vehicles and kept going until the moments shown in the body cam footage.

Deputies work hard to get Ordena out of the car, but he won’t budge.

They’re forced to smash open his windows just to open the door and drag him out of the car.

“Karma don’t show up when you want her to, but she do show up that’s what I can say,” Warren said. “I can’t believe it. I can’t. But every day that I wake up, my son is still with me. That’s what makes my tears go away, but it still hurts.”

Ordena is still locked up in Orange County. He’s due back in court in July.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/body-cam-released-in-takedown-of-man-accused-of-trying-to-drown-his-son,2019-05-08T02:24:28Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

819,Florida Southern College business student David Balandi launches self-named sports apparel company,"David Balandi's self-named apparel company combines business with philanthropy. It's mission: Believe, Achieve, Lead, Accomplish, Nourish, Dedicate, Inspire.

LAKELAND — Perhaps someday the name Balandi will be as recognizable in the sportswear realm as Nike, Adidas and Puma.

For now, David Balandi is a Florida Southern College student who has already realized an aspiration formed in eighth grade to create his own business.

Balandi, a native of the African nation of Chad, launched a self-named apparel company two years ago, drawing upon advice from professors in FSC’s Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise. His youth is not the only element that makes the company unusual.

Balandi, 20, also made philanthropy part of his business model. The company includes a separate line, and all proceeds from those sales are devoted to a program that supports orphans in Africa.

Among the 70 products available from Balandi’s online store are a blue T-shirt emblazoned with the word “BELIEVE” below a stylized “B” and women’s tights in black with white letters spelling out “PERSEVERE” on the lower leg.

Using the letters of his last name, Balandi created an acronym that projects his company’s principles: Believe, Achieve, Lead, Accomplish, Nourish, Dedicate, Inspire.

“Our mission is a vision of achieving,” Balandi said, sitting in a conference room at the Becker Business Building on campus. “That’s something I feel very familiar with, and that’s the energy and the motivation that I wanted my company to give off.”

Balandi, who stands 6 feet 3 inches tall, played basketball during his high school days in the West African nation of Burkina Faso. The impetus for his sportswear line arose in the summer of 2017 when he was playing basketball with his older brother, Antonio Balandi, who played last season for Syracuse University.

The brothers noticed that the shorts they wore caused friction on their legs after becoming wet with sweat. David Balandi decided to design a pair of athletic shorts with hemmed bottoms that wouldn’t slide as much during movement.

After having the shorts produced, he asked some Florida Southern basketball players to try them out and got positive reactions. Balandi launched his company and has since expanded into shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts, caps and socks, including products for women.

Every sportswear company needs a distinctive logo, such as Nike’s “swoosh,” and Balandi set out to create an image based on the first letter of his surname. He used various fonts to produce 50 “B’s,” and then he and his brother narrowed their preferences down to a top choice.

The resulting logo is a lower-case “b” with a rounded bottom and a severely shortened ascender, suggesting a stick figure of a cat’s head with only a right ear.

Some of the products bear just the name “Balandi” and/or the logo. Others are printed with such words as “Achieve,” and a purple tank top proclaims “Woman Up.”

Balandi created and operates his company’s website (www.balandi.co), which includes photos of Florida Southern students wearing his products. Balandi said the items are made in Florida, Africa and Asia.

Typical prices are $15 for socks, $20 for caps, $25 for T-shirts and $40 for hoodies.

Balandi, a business administration major scheduled to graduate next fall, said he benefited from concepts he learned in a principals of management course taught by Silviana Falcon, an assistant professor of business administration and health care management.

“Obviously, I’m very proud of him,” Falcon said. “He understands now what a business owner is. It takes a lot of resilience and a lot of work. It’s not for the faint of heart. Running a business in itself is difficult, and then you add the layer of social entrepreneurship and now you’ve made the business endeavor 100 times more complicated.”

Balandi said other FSC professors have provided valuable guidance on accounting and the legal elements of business.

“It’s been really amazing,” he said. “I’m very lucky to be part of a great business school with great faculty members and great students. They have really helped me out in terms of really shaped my vision and shaped what this company means to me.”

After his graduation in December, Balandi plans to run his business out of Catapult, a co-working space in Lakeland geared toward promoting startup ventures.

Balandi has marketed the company through social media, and he enlisted a well-known African comedian, Dulo, to record a commercial. In the spot, the man at first struggles to maintain his balance on inline skates, but after putting on Balandi sportswear he rolls gracefully down the street.

“My balance went from zero to 100 real quick,” Dulo tells the camera.

Though he’ll happily use humor to promote his products, Balandi has a serious purpose for his brand. He spoke of visiting an orphanage in Burkina Faso before starting his company and being shocked to see the children’s lessons were conducted on benches outside.

The company includes the Balandi Kids Program, a nonprofit segment devoted to supporting children in Africa and the United States. Balandi established the $15K Impact program, which aims to raise $15,000 by December for the building of a classroom and library at the Burkina Faso orphanage.

Balandi has a For The Kids line of apparel bearing that phrase and his logo, and he said all receipts from those items go toward the children’s initiative.

Balandi has become active in the Florida Southern chapter of Enactus, a worldwide, college-based nonprofit organization. Along with other Enactus members, he volunteers twice a week at Florida Baptist Children’s Homes in Lakeland.

The students tutor foster children and lead them in social activities. Enactus members have also taken the kids to a Lakeland Magic game and a Florida Southern basketball game, Balandi said.

Falcon serves as faculty advisor to FSC’s Enactus chapter.

“I see in David what I see in a lot of different students, and that is the true desire to help other people through entrepreneurship,” she said. “So that is exciting to see, that this generation is seeing beyond themselves and actually wanting to be part of the solution, and I think Enactus provides that platform.”

821,Winter Park bank robbery suspect arrested in South Florida,"WINTER PARK, Fla. - More than two weeks after a bank robbery in Winter Park, a suspect has been found in South Florida and taken into custody, according to police.

[PREVIOUS: Search underway for bank robbery suspect in Winter Park]

Officers with the Winter Park Police Department said Steven Robert Calt, 40, used a note to rob employees at the TD Bank at 810 North Orlando Avenue earlier this month and fled.

A search began immediately after the robbery, prompting a heavy law enforcement presence in the area of Webster Avenue and Lee Road.

The search ended without Calt being located, and a warrant was issued for his arrest one week later.

With the help of the Orange County Sheriff's Office Felony Squad and the U.S. Marshals Fort Lauderdale Office, authorities found Calt Friday in the Fort Lauderdale area, police said.

Calt was taken to the Broward County Jail and was charged with robbery and grand theft over $300 but less than $5,000, officials said.

828,Gem of the Harlem Renaissance on view at Anderson Brickler Gallery,"Once again, the Anderson Brickler Gallery, in collaboration with the Riley House Museum, is at the forefront of introducing Tallahassee to history lessons that might have been missed along the way.

Combining art and literature and an historical backstory that touches both African-American life as well as the broader scope of the American-experience, the Anderson Brickler Gallery presents God’s Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse, as part of its Floridians in the Harlem Renaissance exhibition and the Riley’s Virtual Harlem show. Featured through May 13, Anderson Brickler will present an illustrated volume of “poetic sermons” by one of the stars of the Harlem Renaissance, James Weldon Johnson.

But first, a moment. What was the Harlem Renaissance?

Following the Civil War in 1865 and Reconstruction, African Americans began to take their place in politics and other civic and economic activities. By 1875, they held numerous public offices throughout the South. But a backlash soon began. The rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the passing of onerous “Jim Crow” laws starting in the 1890s disenfranchised and disempowered Southern African Americans.

Unable to live under ever more oppressive conditions, the Great Migration began. Heading North to the Midwest and Northeast, thousands of African Americans relocated to states where their enterprise and intellect could flourish. And thus was born in New York City a cultural movement known as the Harlem Renaissance.

Painters, writers, actors, dancers, and musicians began to produce works that would influence the rest of American culture for generations to come. And James Weldon Johnson and his illustrator, Aaron Douglas were at the forefront.

James Weldon Johnson was a Renaissance Man in any sense. Well-educated, he became a lawyer first, then a Broadway songwriter, then a diplomat serving the United States in Venezuela, a novelist, an important officer in the NAACP, and finally, a professor at Fisk University. One of his most influential works was a collection called, God’s Trombones, Seven Negro Sermons in Verse.

In the 1927 work, Johnson calls on his own memories of black preachers, their cadence, their passion, their ability to articulate emotionally the message of the sacred texts. Written not in dialect, which at the time was a subject of comical derision, but in simple language that goes directly to the heart, Johnson’s allusion to “trombones” is an homage to those preachers whose booming voices could modulate to lullabies, but whose verbal musicality could move a congregation to tears.

To illustrate the sermon/poems, The Creation, The Prodigal Son, Go Down Death, Noah Built the Ark, The Crucifixion, Let My People Go, and The Judgment Day, another Harlem Renaissance giant was chosen, Aaron Douglas.

Douglas was an illustrator and muralist whose large works hang in the New York City Library and at Fisk University where he founded the Art Department. Influenced by the Art Deco and Art Nouveau movements as well as African and Egyptian silhouettes, Douglas was in demand for the contemporary style in which he rendered African American figures.

The collaboration between Weldon Johnson and Douglas resulted in the modernistic prints for God’s Trombone’s that combine geometrical circles in soft shadows, stronger ""beams"" of light, forest and city locales, and African or African American figures who are variously joyous, industrious, as well as exploited. Rendered in softly muted tones that fade into shadow and mist, or layered again and again to form large groups, Douglas approaches the illustrations as he might a mural, monumentally conceived, yet exquisitely detailed.

It is these pieces of art that give God’s Trombones, Seven Negro Sermons in Verse much of its power, and which provide an intimate look at the creativity born of suffering that was the Harlem Renaissance.

The graphics, as well as the poems, are on display at the Anderson Brickler Gallery through May 13 at 1705 S. Adams St. Wednesdays 11 a.m.-3 p.m. and Saturday 2-5 p.m.. To schedule gallery visits and group tours: andersonbricklergallery@mail.com

SPRING HILL, Fla. (WFLA) - The Hernando County Sheriff's Office is asking for the public's help in locating a man accused of dragging a pit bull behind a truck in Spring Hill.

Deputies have identified the suspect as Gregory Tousignant, 58, witnesses told Hernando deputies the dog was tied to the truck’s back bumper by a piece of rope that was attached to the dog’s collar.

Tousignant was unaware the dog had jumped out of the bed of his truck.

It is illegal to carry any pet in the bed of a truck that is not properly secured and prevented from jumping out of a moving vehicle.

A warrant has been issued for Tousignant’s arrest on a misdemeanor charge of Cruelty to Animals, which carries a $1,000 bond. In the meantime, the pit bull is being fostered at a vet tech's house and might be available for adoption once he is healed.

Anyone with information regarding Tousignant's whereabouts is asked to contact the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office at 352-754-6830.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/hernando-county/hernando-county-deputies-seek-dog-dragging-suspect/1989307048,2019-05-08T16:53:23Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
831,Appeals court rules it has no 'jurisdiction' over confession in Segura murder case,"CLOSE Henry Segura takes the stand in his own defense during the quadruple murder trial on Aug. 11, 2017.

An appeals court ruled it doesn’t have the authority to require a gang members' claim he is responsible for a 2010 quadruple murder to be allowed at the trial of the man accused of the crime.

In an opinion released Tuesday, the First District Court of Appeal wrote it did not have the jurisdiction over what evidence could and couldn’t be used in Henry Segura's upcoming trial.

The DCA dismissed the petition by Segura's attorneys to force the Second Judicial Circuit to allow the odd testimony of James Carlos Santos that he, from federal prison, ordered the murders Segura is charged with committing.

Segura, 40, has sat through 12 trial delays and one mistrial on charges he was responsible for the brutal November 2010 killing of his girlfriend Brandi Peters, her twin daughters, Tamiyah and Taniyah Peters, and their 3-year-old son JaVonte Segura.

He has remained in the Leon County Detention Facility for 2,765 days since his arrest in 2011. He was set to stand trial last month but the case was continued.

On the eve of Segura’s first trial in August, Santos claimed Peters was killed in a drug cartel hit that he orchestrated.

A series of threatening emails exchanged between Peters and Santos in the days before she was killed show she was concerned about her involvement with Santos, the Chicago-based gang, the Vice Lords, and the Los Zetas cartel, according to Segura’s attorney Nathan Prince and Santos’ testimony. Peters is purported to have been running Colombian cocaine for the Mexican cartel and skimmed close to $90,000 of her loads.

With Santos’ testimony, Segura could be acquitted. Without it, he likely faces another mistrial, one of his attorneys Michael Ufferman contended.

The DCA judges agreed the particulars of the case warranted a closer look, but could not rule on the potential impact of the evidence.

“Segura’s circumstances are indeed unusual,” the judges found. “But none grants us jurisdiction for the pre-trial review of disputed evidentiary issues. Neither pretrial detention nor the possibility of another mistrial constitutes the type of irreparable harm necessary (to support allowing the evidence.)”

Related: Leon High’s Henry Segura III blazes own trail amid father’s murder trial

Prosecutors allege Segura killed Peters and the children to avoid paying more than $20,000 in back child support.

Santos invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at Segura’s first trial and did not take the stand. His testimony that he is responsible for the murders has been refuted by Prosecutor Jon Fuchs and has been previously ruled inadmissible in trial.

Santos falsely claimed the murder of a man in Kentucky and an Atlanta police officer.

In letters sent to Leon Circuit Judge James C. Hankinson that have been filed in court records, Santos has expressed interest in testifying at Segura’s next trial.

832,Dericka Lindsey case: 9-year-old's adopted mom to stand trial for her death,"CLOSE A memorial was held for 9-year-old Dericka Lindsay Thursday, Nov. 16, 2017. She died after her cousin sat on her as punishment Oct. 14.

A Pensacola woman will stand trial Thursday and Friday for her alleged role in a bizarre form of discipline that killed her adopted daughter.

Grace Joan Smith, 71, is the last of three people to face a jury in the death of 9-year-old Dericka Lindsey. Both Smith's husband, James Smith, and niece, Veronica Green Posey, have already been convicted and sentenced to prison for their roles in the child's death.

In October 2017, the Smiths reportedly called Posey to help them stop Dericka from misbehaving. Prosecutors say Grace Smith and Posey both spanked the girl, then Posey — who weighed approximately 320 pounds — sat on Dericka's torso for several minutes, suffocating her.

James Smith ultimately pleaded no contest to charges of aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. Posey was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Court records indicate both co-defendants could be called as witnesses in the Grace Smith's trial.

Grace Smith's trial was briefly delayed in February when a judge ruled she was not competent for trial. February. At the time, physicians testified that she suffered from dementia and refused to eat food or take medication.

Smith was involuntarily committed to a state hospital where staff worked to restore her ""competency"" and get her to a state where she could follow court proceedings and help her attorneys craft her defense.

Medical staff made quick progress, and in April the court determined that Smith was fit for trial.

833,BLOTTER: What's a knife or five between friends?,"PANAMA CITY BEACH — An intoxicated man demonstrated over the weekend exactly why deputies pat people down for their safety before taking them to jail.

A Bay County Sheriff's deputy responded to a Sunset Avenue address, where they found a man hopping fences through people's backyards. The ""obviously intoxicated"" man was identified and told deputies he was just looking for his own place and apparently decided the way to do that was to fence hop in people's backyards until he found his home or the cops were called, whichever came first.

When backup arrived, a deputy asked the man to remove the knife that was visible on his hip while they sorted everything out. The deputy then asked the man if he had any other weapons before patting him down.

During the pat down, the deputy found not one, not two, not even three, but four additional knives on the man.

And a loaded gun.

The man did not have a concealed carry permit for the .22 revolver, and the man was detained in a patrol vehicle.

About that time, the mystery of the fence-hopper deepened as deputies located a silver Harley-Davidson motorcycle laying in the roadway nearby next to a damaged mailbox. The fence-hopping man was wearing a biker club ""cut"" so, putting two-and-two together, the deputies asked if the bike belonged to the man, which he denied.

""(The man) denied that the bike was his, despite the fact that he had the key for it on his waist and his foot prints were all over the ground next to the bike,"" the deputy wrote.

Despite his ""deny deny deny"" tact, the man was arrested by Florida Highway Patrol for DUI.

LAKELAND, Fla. (WFLA) - Police are searching for a hit-and-run driver after a 59-year-old man was struck in Lakeland Monday.

The incident occurred on East Main Street at about 9:23 p.m.

Police say the man was walking when he was struck by an unknown make or model SUV. The vehicle fled the scene in an eastbound direction.

Life-saving measures were to save the man and he was transported to Lakeland Regional Health, he is currently listed in critical condition.

A witness described the driver of the vehicle as a light-skinned male, wearing an orange shirt and dark pants. The vehicle was described as a black or dark blue SUV. The vehicle should have damage to the passenger headlight and grill.

If you have any information in this accident, please call the Lakeland Police Department at 863-834-2553.",https://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/hit-and-run-injures-man-in-lakeland-driver-sought/1985542976,2019-05-07T08:43:48Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
838,Suspect caught in fatal shooting of Mississippi officer at police station,"JACKSON, Miss. – The manhunt for the suspected killer of a Mississippi police officer ended Monday night with the suspect's arrest.

Darian Tawan Atkinson, 19, who was wanted on capital murder charges, was led handcuffed through the same parking lot where he allegedly opened fire on Biloxi Police Officer Robert McKeithen on Sunday.

Atkinson, in a video streamed on social media by WLOX-TV, appeared to be smiling as he passed dozens of uniformed officers on his walk from a cruiser to the front doors of the police station. Some bystanders could be seen clapping and cheering.

Biloxi Police Chief John Miller said a Biloxi officer was on his way home when he spotted a man resembling Atkinson in Wiggins, about 35 miles northwest of Biloxi. He said the officer called the Wiggins Police Department, which sent officers to make the arrest.

""We feel vindicated. He’s been treated properly and fairly. And now we will grieve for the (officer's) family,"" Miller said. ""They’ll know shortly he’s been arrested. Maybe that will give them some relief.""

McKeithen, a nearly 24-year veteran of the Biloxi Police Department, was shot and killed outside a police station Sunday night.

It was unclear what prompted the killing. Miller said he didn't know of a motive.

Feb. 7: Matthew Rittner, Milwaukee police officer shot and killed, served two tours of duty in Iraq

Authorities said a man approached McKeithen in the station's parking lot after coming inside the station and shot the 58-year-old officer multiple times.

Miller said there will be another charge for accessory to a crime, and declined to elaborate further.

Miller wouldn't say whether Atkinson had told police anything. He said Atkinson would be questioned and then transported to the Harrison County jail in Gulfport. It's unclear when Atkinson will go before a judge or if he has a lawyer.

Miller said investigators want to make sure they have a ""solid case.""

""We want the district attorney to be pleased with the case we present. We want this guy to pay for what he’s done,"" he said.

Miller expressed thanks for the officers who worked the case, some of whom haven't rested in 40 hours, he said. He also thanked the community for their support.

Nov. 19: Police officer among 4 dead in 'horrific' Chicago hospital shooting

Asked about the expression on the suspect's face as he was led through the police station doors, Miller replied: ""I'm not bothered by his smile.""

Monday began with law enforcement circulating video footage and photos of the then-unidentified suspected killer in hopes of pinning down his name. They showed a man in a black T-shirt, blue shorts and a red hat sauntering through a pair of sliding glass doors.

During a morning news conference, Miller described McKeithen as an ""unbelievably fine policeman.""

He had served on the force for nearly 24 years, he said, and was planning to retire this year.

""(McKeithen) was a fine and decent man, a great policeman and he served the citizens of Biloxi well,"" Miller said.

McKeithen leaves behind a wife, daughter, two stepsons and a stepdaughter, Miller said.

It's unclear how Atkinson got to Wiggins after a day when police searched locations in Biloxi, sometimes carrying assault rifles, looking for the man. Miller said he expected at least one person would be charged as an accessory for illegally aiding Atkinson.

When authorities announced they identified the suspect as Atkinson, they urged anyone who knew where he was to turn him in.

McKeithen's relatives said Monday through Biloxi city spokesman Vincent Creel that they weren't prepared to talk. A memorial service is planned Tuesday night at Biloxi police headquarters. The officer's funeral and burial are planned for May 13.

839,Video shows takedown of Orange County man accused of trying to drown his child,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - Body camera footage from Orange County sheriff's deputies show how they apprehended a man wanted for trying to drown his own child in an apartment complex swimming pool.

Family members called deputies after they said Wilkens Ordena, 29, held his one-year-old son under water between his thighs in an attempt to kill him on March 4.

Deputies said Ordena hit two of their patrol cars as he fled from them, crashing through the front gates of the apartment complex.

They said he led them on a short pursuit up Apopka Vineland Road, where they were able to pull him over.

840,"Brevard duo accused of waterboarding man, force-feeding him dog food","Left to right: John Faulk, 27, and Steven Erickson, 24, charged with attempted first-degree murder and kidnapping.

TITUSVILLE, Fla. - Accusations of stolen cocaine escalated into kidnapping and torture over the weekend in Titusville, according to police reports.

Two men were arrested and charged with attempted murder and kidnapping. Police said the two beat and waterboarded a man after suspecting his friend had stolen cocaine from them Saturday, according to News 6 partner Florida Today.

Police were called about 12:30 a.m. Sunday when a battered man was admitted to the hospital, according to arrest reports. He had been pistol-whipped, waterboarded and force-fed dog food.

John Faulk, 27, of Titusville, and Steven Erickson, 24, of Cocoa, were charged with attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and inflicting harm on the person, robbery with a firearm and second-degree grand theft.

After a long day of drinking and using cocaine, the men believed their victim's friend had stolen cocaine from them before leaving to get food, police said. So they restrained the man's hands with tape and covered his nose and mouth with cloth before pouring water over his face, telling him to get his friend to return the cocaine or they would kill him.

They used table legs and a gun to beat him before uncovering his mouth to feed him dog food, police reported.

The torture lasted about 45 minutes before the man escaped to a nearby friend's house and then went to the hospital. Police said the suspects also stole the man's cell phone and over $800, Florida Today reported.

After police were called, officers responded to a Beverly Street home where gunshots from inside the residence prompted a SWAT response as well, Titusville police said.

“The SWAT team responded with tactical measures and two suspects were taken into custody,” according to a statement from Amy Matthews, spokeswoman for the Titusville Police Department.

Matthews did not say what tactical measures were used when arresting Faulk and Erickson at the home.

No further information was available about the incidents Monday afternoon. The case remains an ongoing investigation.

Faulk is being held at the Brevard County Jail Complex in lieu of $115,000 bond. Erickson is being held in lieu of $122,000 bond.

852,"UF student, 22, charged with sexual battery","A Gainesville man accused of sexually battering a woman on March 22 after spending time in a bar was arrested by the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office.

Maxim Emilio Portillo, 22, of 6418 SW 90th St., was charged with one count of sexual battery, according to an arrest report.

The woman told authorities she has known Portillo for about five years and they went to school together. They were at a bar with two of Portillo’s friends.

She told deputies she had two drinks, well within her tolerance level. However, she became ill and disoriented. She vomited in the bathroom. The group left in an Uber, but she became sick again so the Uber driver let her and Portillo out.

Portillo hailed a Lyft. The driver told deputies the woman was extremely intoxicated and that he had to stop so she could vomit. Portillo also seemed drunk but was steady on his feet, the driver said. They were eventually dropped off at Portillo’s home.

The woman told authorities he sexually battered her there, first on his sister’s bed and then on a couch in the room, where he reportedly put a pillow over her face. She said she repeatedly told him to stop.

""The victim was so impaired she was unable to resist the defendant's attack and unable to give consent to sexual activity,"" the report said.

853,Clermont man guilty of hit-and-run fatality,"TAVARES — David Sheets is guilty of leaving the scene of an accident that claimed the life of pedestrian Aaron Zacharias in 2015, a jury decided after one hour Thursday.

The state argued that it proved four elements necessary for a conviction: that the driver was involved in a crash leaving the scene of an accident; knew he was involved in a crash; knew or should have known that the accident caused injury or death; and that he willfully failed to stop at or near the scene.

Much of the week-long testimony was highly technical, including Highway Patrol investigators talking about the complex mathematical equations used in their crime scene calculations, and a state crime lab analyst who testified that the odds of another person’s blood other than Zacharias’ being on the pickup truck’s broken windshield was 700-billion-to-1, or 100 times greater than the world’s population.

What the jurors did not hear was that Zacharias was a “mama’s boy,” in the words of his mother, Neena Zacharias.

“He was single … humble, loving, kind, a man anyone would like to talk to,” she said. “There was no judgment. He was a greater listener.”

He was the kind of person who would support his friends, no matter what. Unemployed at the time of the accident, he once worked at the Circle K he had walked to that night.

For someone with a gentle spirit, he had an unusual dream: He wanted to be an MMA fighter.

He walked the route down Lakeshore, not even a mile, every night, to lose weight, Neena laughed. He would always buy a bag of spicy potato chips, then walk home to his mother’s house on Priebe Road to play video games.

Defense attorney Kelly Johnson blasted what she called “weak links in the chain,” including a 911 caller’s testimony that he saw a light in the road and stopped to check it out. It was a cell phone with a flashlight app, he said, and he picked it up and used it to survey the scene. However, a later crime scene photo showed the phone lying face down, and it is unclear how the phone ended up in the hands of investigators.

There was also no proof that a flashlight found in the “on” position belonged to Zacharias, she said.

She also suggested that witnesses, including a woman who lived near the crash site, had “perfect times” in their timeline testimony because they had reviewed crash reports.

Assistant State Attorney Jason Nimeth, however, pointed out inconsistencies in Sheets'original statement to Florida Highway Patrol and a recorded report he made to his insurance company a month later.

Sheets claimed he thought he hit a deer, like the time he hit one on a country road in Georgia in 2008 or 2009. He said he stopped, went down Lake Shore, turned around and came back and still did not see anything.

Nimeth showed jurors a map and said the time, distance and cross streets Sheet cited made no sense.

Sheets self-reported the accident on Dec. 8, 2015 but did so because one of the clues at the accident site were pieces of Bondo, an auto body repair paste. His 1968 Chevy truck had chunks of the substance on the front from a prior accident, and he knew it would be difficult to get repairs with that information published in news reports, Nimeth said.

Circuit Judge Heidi Davis ordered a pre-sentence investigation. The maximum sentence is 30 years, with a four-year-minimum mandatory, although technically the judge could waive that requirement.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190509/clermont-man-guilty-of-hit-and-run-fatality?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T13:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,Florida Man,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — A Vero Beach man was arrested Tuesday after biting into a deputy's arm during a traffic stop, according to an arrest report.

Edward Lejon Thompson, 23, faces three counts of battery on a law enforcement officer and depriving an officer of means of communication, resisting arrest with violence and two counts of corruption by threat, among other charges.

He was being held Wednesday at the Indian River County Jail on $45,000 bail.

The incident happened about 8 p.m., during a traffic stop for a busted headlight on 45th Street near U.S. 1.

When they went to detain him, he sunk his teeth into a deputy's arm, causing ""open wound lacerations...(from) multiple bites,"" the report said.

Deputies said Thompson kicked and scratched as he was taken to the ground, knocking away their radios.

He continued to kick, threaten and throw things during a medical clearance at Cleveland Clinic Indian River Hospital before going to jail, the report said.

Indian River County Sheriff's officials did not return a request for an update on the injured deputy's condition Wednesday.

856,Documents detail 'severe injuries' in abuse of toddler; two face charges,"Clayton Pafford is one of two people charged in connection with the abuse of a toddler who suffered ""severe injuries."" The girl's mother, Heather Reid was also arrested. (Photo: Leon County Detention Facility)

The mother of a 2-year-old girl noticed injuries to her child every time she left her alone with her live-in boyfriend.

Leon County Sheriff’s Office investigators were made aware Monday of a possible child abuse incident when the girl was transported to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare with severe injuries.

Her brain was bleeding in two places. She had liver lacerations. Both her ears were bruised. She had cuts and abrasions on her hip, face and arms.

The girl’s mother, 26-year-old Heather Reid, was arrested after being questioned by detectives. She faces charges of child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm.

She told detectives she heard a thud come from the other room and believed the girl had fallen out of bed. After answering that only she and another man were at the house, she backtracked and said that her boyfriend, Clayton Pafford, was also home.

Heather Reid, 26, was arrested on charges of child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm. (Photo: Leon County Detention Facility)

She said Monday was not the first time she noticed the child with injuries.

“She noticed every time she leaves (her) alone with Clayton, she would return home and discover more injuries,” according to court records.

Reid said she didn't report previous injuries she believed were connected with Pafford because she was worried the toddler would be taken by the Florida Department of Children and Families.

The friend told LCSO he heard the same thud but that Reid wasn’t at the Crossway Court house when it happened. He saw Pafford, 23, come out of a bedroom with the toddler’s, bloody limp body. Pafford began calling Reid instead of for medical help.

The friend called 911 as Pafford left the home saying, “Don’t tell anyone I was here.”

Pafford, 23, was arrested Tuesday after leading law enforcement officials on a chase through Woodville. He faces charges of child neglect, aggravated battery on a child, kidnapping, hitting a police dog, aggravated assault of a police officer and multiple other charges stemming from fleeing officers.

LCSO deputies, along with members of the U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force and the Florida Highway Patrol, searched for Pafford all night. He was finally located at about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday driving on Back Forest Road by a member of LCSO’s Special Projects Investigations Detection Enforcement Response Unit and members of the Florida Highway Patrol. When they tried to stop him, Pafford refused to stop and fled.

Persuing deputies and troopers used stop sticks in the southbound travel lane of Old Woodville Highway, but Pafford swerved toward the deputy onto the St. Marks bike trail, narrowly missing him. Pafford turned back onto Old Woodville Highway and crossed over Bob Miller Road before troopers were able to stop his vehicle, LCSO reported.

Pafford, who had a passenger in his vehicle, refused to surrender. A LCSO K9 was used to take him into custody and after being treated at a local hospital was taken to the Leon County Detention Facility.

The couple was investigated by DCF last month when hospital staff noticed the toddler’s injuries.

In mid-April, staff at Capital Regional Medical Center noticed the girl was dirty, was covered in bug bites, had a bruise under her left eye and a bald spot on her head. The girl had a burn on her right hand and lesions on her body.

Staff members overheard Reid making alarming statements about not being able to take care of the girl and not caring if she was eating.

The Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office K-9 who was seriously injured in a robbery attempt in April is smiling wide these days.

Not only is Orkon giddy to be back catching bad guys with the SRSO, but the dog is grinning because he received get-well gift baskets from his fellow K-9 pals at the Pensacola Police Department.

""It was really awesome, man,"" said SRSO Sgt. Rich Aloy, who was present Monday when several PPD officers and K-9s personally presented Orkon with baskets full of toys and treats. ""To just show the inter-agency partnership, it's just gestures like that that mean a lot to our agency, and to the K-9 agency.""

Chew toys, Frisbees and tennis balls were stuffed into a small basket with Orkon's name written across the front.

A note attached to the basket that was ""signed"" by seven PPD K-9's playfully read:

""Wer happ to hear ur back at work. We had the hoomans box up some of our farrit toys and treets. Hope you like dem. We destroyed our Frisbee in 43 seconds — see if you can beat dat. — Janus, Kojo, Nashoba, Mia, Foster, Meeko, and Cross.""

""That's just what you do to support one another,"" PPD spokesman Mike Wood said. ""More than anything, we were just glad that the dog is OK.""

While responding to a reported burglary in Milton, Orkon was repeatedly punched by a suspect on April 9. The dog was rushed to an emergency animal treatment facility to undergo surgery after suffering a contusion to his eye and lacerations to his leg.

859,How to keep your cooling bill down when the summer heats up,"- As high temperatures move in for the summer Floridians are looking for ways to stay cool.

New homeowner and owner of Central Florida Home Pros Residential Real Estate John MacFarlane is keeping the heat out of his Volusia County home by installing window films.

“The afternoon sun was extremely blazing and bright and you could just feel the heat pouring in through the windows,” MacFarlane said.

He hired Tint Man Incorporated to install the tint on his home windows.

“Basically from time change to time change [we’re] completely slammed,” said the company’s president, Shawn Mangrum.

Mangrum said his team installs window films on 5-10 residential and commercial properties every week and they stay busy installing tint on car windows every day.

“[The tint is] going to get rid of your radiant heat. The radiant heat is the heat around your windows. So window films can reject over 80 percent of that radiant heat,” Mangrum said. “Then you have infrared heat. That’s when the sun is coming directly through the windows, like if you’re eating dinner and you’re just uncomfortable, well you can get rid of the infrared heat by up to 98 percent.”

Mangrum said many people do not think about tinting home windows because of a common misconception.

“People think of tint and you have to go really dark. The darker you go, the more heat you cut out. That’s actually very untrue for both your home and vehicle.”

He said tinting can keep cars and homes cooler and lower power bills.

Duke Energy Florida Spokesperson Ana Gibbs said homeowners can make minor adjustments in their homes to keep it cool during the summer.

“We recommend during the summer you keep your AC at around 78 degrees.”

Gibbs said homeowners can lower their power bill by making the difference between the inside and outside temperatures as small as possible. She also recommends maintaining HVAC units and regularly changing the air filters.

Gibbs said only use ceiling fans when you are in a room. Using them could allow people to raise the thermostat by as much as four degrees. She recommends turning off the fan if you leave a room.

Duke Energy also recommends the following tips to stay cool during the summer:

● Close blinds and curtains on sunny days.

● If you have a whole-house fan, use it to pull cool air into your home at night or in the early morning through open windows. Turn the fan off and shut the windows during the day.

● Use bathroom and kitchen fans to remove heat and humidity caused by showering and cooking. (And take short showers instead of baths to save even more year-round.)

● Run your dishwasher, washing machine and dryer at night when it’s cooler. Run full loads. Consider air drying dishes and clothes to save even more.

● If you’re going on vacation, the Duke Energy energy slayer calculator can show you how much you’ll save (duke-energy.com/EnergyVampire) by unplugging appliances you’re not using while you’re away.

863,Rent in Titusville and Melbourne,"Every year at this time – the end of the theatrical season – Steven J Heron, artistic director of the Titusville Playhouse (TPI), and now the Henegar Center, engages in a bit of self-indulgence. It comes in the form of plays that give audiences the chance to see what local actors can do with drama.

They are plays Heron loves, and no play does he love better than “Rent.” It will be presented May 10 through June 7 at the Emma Parrish Theatre, and June 7 through 16 at the Henegar. This year, having spent the last several months commuting between downtown Titusville and downtown Melbourne, said self-indulgence is more than warranted.

The pop culture favorite musical ""Rent"" begins tonight at Titusville Playhouse. (Photo: Photo by Niko Stamos)

“It’s been hectic because we’re spread so thin,” he said, referring to TPI staffers who have joined him in going from one theater to the other. “Once we get this season finished, things should be better.”

Still, for Heron, things cannot be better than “Rent.” The Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning musical based on “La Boheme” in this case the story of young Bohemians living in New York City that addresses poverty, art, love and AIDS.

‘“Rent’ was the first show I ever became obsessed with,” Heron said. “I saw it 15 times with the original cast and I saw it Off-Broadway before it moved uptown.”

It “changed the face of Broadway,” he added. “I don’t think we’d have ‘Hamilton’ if we did not have ‘Rent.”

It also is personal.

“When I moved to New York in 1992, being from the South, I was the one who was . . . different, and so it appealed to me, as it did to so many others,” he said. “It was my generation’s ‘Spring Awakening,’ my generation’s ‘South Pacific.’ But more important, it meant so much because, having had the experience of friends suffer and pass away from AIDS. When I lived in New York, gay society was dealing with it better than anyone else.”

Heron, who never has tested positive for HIV, dealt with it directly, as a volunteer at the famed David Geffen Center for HIV Prevention and Health Education.

""Rent"" moves from Titusville Playhouse to The Henegar Center in Melbourne on June 7. (Photo: Photo by Niko Stamos)

“We did whatever was necessary, and they would pair volunteers with patients. I learned a lot there,” he said.

Still, what a generation that cannot remember or fail to understand the significance of the AIDS crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s – people of the age to portray characters in “Rent” – bothers him.

“They really don’t realize how pervasive it was, how destructive,” he said softly. “An entire generation of artists was lost.”

“Rent” at TPI and Henegar elicits anything but sadness, though. Heron, always ebullient, is nothing short of elated about how it is working out.

“Are people excited about this?” he asked. “We had 96 people audition for the show, which has a cast of 15. It is incredible.”

The cast, he called, “freaking spectacular. They came in with a sense of the show because they’re so familiar with it.”

Little will change after the show moves to Henegar, either; it will have the same cast, the same set, the same almost everything, with a few technical exceptions because of the way Henegar is built. And after its run finishes, Henegar will be a bit different too.

Heron would love to paint the interior of the 99-year-old building, though that may have to wait in favor of other improvements. Orchestra seating will be stripped out and replaced with wider seats; the stage will have been extended.

865,Disney bus spotted covered in lovebugs,"- Lovebugs are in the air and not even Walt Disney World can escape them.

A Florida man snapped a picture of a Disney bus that was covered in love bugs.





The good news is that lovebugs are not harmful to humans. The species originated in Central America and got their name because they are known to fly around in mating pairs. They migrated through Texas and Louisana before coming to Florida. They continue to expand and can be found as far north as South Carolina.

Love bugs are especially common in Florida because of the heat and decomposing plant debris. University of Florida scientists believe that lovebugs confuse those odors with chemicals in exhaust fumes, explaining why we see so many of them around highways.

In fact, most people see lovebugs as splatters on windshields and hoods. They can damage your car’s paint if not cleaned off.

866,Orange County man said stranger yelled anti-Semitic insults at him while he was landscaping,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - An Orange County homeowner said a woman drove onto his private property causing damage to his landscaping while hurling anti-Semitic insults.

Jeff Gelman said the incident happened Saturday while he was having breakfast with his wife and believes the woman drove in through an unlocked gate.

“We looked out to window and we saw someone doing donuts in our backyard, right there,” Gelman said.

Gelman said he has never seen the woman before.

Orange County Sheriff's deputies identified the woman as Kristen Kelly. The 45-year-old Winter Garden woman is accused of verbally attacking the Gelmans at at one point trying to run them over with her Dodge SUV.

“She was yelling, go home Jew tell your neighbors that Jesus Christ is here and that I’m going to clean some dirty Jews,” Gelman said.

Gelman said he snapped pictures of the woman and her vehicle to help authorities catch her.

“We didn’t recognize her at all; never saw her in our lives.”

The Windermere father said things got worse when he and his wife tried approaching Kelly to ask her to get off their property.

“When she got out of the car she sprayed us with detergent and said ‘cleaning the dirty Jews,’” Gelman said.

Kelly is charged with aggravated assault and is being held at the Orange County jail.

John Montgomery called the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office to report the bogus bill only to find out that the statement was from Progressive Leasing, stating that Montgomery had bought a bridal ring set valued at nearly $1,900.

The statement went on to read the payments would begin on May 15 and continue bi-weekly for 27 payments. The total amount with all charges added up was more than $4,000. Montgomery did not make the purchase or authorize it at a Kay Jeweler in Alabama.

When he called the company and spoke with a customer service representative, his account was closed and the case was referred to the Progressive Leasing fraud department.

Deputies urged Montgomery to contact Social Security to inform them his number had been compromised so he could take the proper security measures.

Accusations of stolen cocaine escalated into kidnapping and torture over the weekend in Titusville, according to police reports.

Two men were arrested and charged with attempted murder and kidnapping. Police said the two beat and waterboarded a man after suspecting his friend had stolen cocaine from them Saturday.

Police were called about 12:30 a.m. Sunday when a battered man was admitted to the hospital, according to arrest reports. He had been pistol-whipped, waterboarded and force-fed dog food.



John Faulk, 27, of Titusville, and Steven Erickson, 24, of Cocoa, were charged with attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and inflicting harm on the person, robbery with a firearm and second-degree grand theft.

After a long day of drinking and using cocaine, the men believed their victim's friend had stolen cocaine from them before leaving to get food, police said. So they restrained the man's hands with tape and covered his nose and mouth with cloth before pouring water over his face, telling him to get his friend to return the cocaine or they would kill him.



They used table legs and a gun to beat him before uncovering his mouth to feed him dog food, police reported.

The torture lasted about 45 minutes before the man escaped to a nearby friend's house and then went to the hospital. Police said the suspects also stole the man's cell phone and over $800.

After police were called, officers responded to a Beverly Street home where gunshots from inside the residence prompted a SWAT response as well, Titusville police said.

“The SWAT team responded with tactical measures and two suspects were taken into custody,” according to a statement from Amy Matthews, spokeswoman for the Titusville Police Department.

Matthews did not say what tactical measures were used when arresting Faulk and Erickson at the home.

No further information was available about the incidents Monday afternoon. The case remains an ongoing investigation.



Faulk is being held at the Brevard County Jail Complex in lieu of $115,000 bond. Erickson is being held in lieu of $122,000 bond.

871,Man arrested in connection with stabbing behind Hialeah strip mall,"Juan Pablo Velasco, 24, is accused of stabbing a man May 4 in Hialeah.

HIALEAH, Fla. - A 24-year-old man was arrested Sunday in connection with a stabbing that occurred Saturday night behind a strip mall in Hialeah.

Hialeah Fire Rescue crews said they received calls for help at a strip mall along the 600 block of East Ninth Street shortly before 6 p.m. Saturday.

According to an arrest report, surveillance video shows Juan Pablo Velasco, who is homeless, stabbing the victim in the neck, chest and back.

Witnesses told Local 10 News reporter Sanela Sabovic that the victim somehow made his way out of the parking lot and through a gangway and reached a restaurant counter, where he asked for help. His shirt was covered in blood, and he was there for a few minutes, pacing. At one point, he was banging on the counter for help.

Hialeah police said the victim, who is in his 20s, was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he underwent surgery for his life-threatening injuries.

According to an arrest report, an officer recognized Velasco from the surveillance video. Police said the victim also identified Velasco as his attacker in a photo and said that he knows him from the area.

A motive for the stabbing is unclear.

Velasco was taken into custody early Sunday for a separate case in which he faces charges of resisting arrest without violence and burglary. He now also faces a charge of attempted second-degree murder.

873,Man wanted on child porn charges in California arrested in Keys,"Michael Manning, wanted by California authorities since 2016, was arrested Friday in the Florida Keys.

KEY WEST, Fla. - A 58-year-old man wanted by California authorities on child pornography charges has been arrested in the Florida Keys.

Michael Manning was arrested Friday on Stock Island. He has been wanted by police in Chico, California, since 2016 on charges of sexually soliciting a minor under the age of 14, engaging in sex acts with a minor and possession of child pornography.

Monroe County Sheriff's Office spokesman Adam Linhardt said deputies were called to an alarm on Shrimp Road and found a man in an unlocked trailer on the side of the property.

The man called himself ""William Wallace Littlejohn"" and said he didn't have any identification.

Federal authorities assisted in the investigation, and deputies were able to identify the man as Manning.

California authorities claim Manning didn't show up to a court hearing, and his vehicle was found parked on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

In addition to the California charges, Manning also faces charges of providing a false name to law enforcement. He was being held without bond at the Stock Island jail and will be returned to California to face charges there.

878,Prolific Tallahassee businessman J.T. Burnette indicted in FBI corruption investigation,"CLOSE Burnette's attorney, Tim Jansen, spoke from outside the federal courthouse. Tallahassee Democrat

John “J.T.” Burnette, a wealthy entrepreneur and the alleged middle man between City Commissioner Scott Maddox and undercover FBI agents, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in connection with the bureau’s long-running public corruption probe, sources close to the investigation said.

Burnette, known for major hotel, restaurant and office projects in Midtown and downtown, is the third person to be charged in the investigation, which began in 2015 with the arrival of the agents.

Who is J.T. Burnette?: Indicted real estate mogul a key player in Tallahassee redevelopment

In December, Maddox and former Downtown Improvement Authority Executive Director Paige Carter-Smith were indicted on federal charges they ran a bribery and extortion ring out of their Governance consulting firm and committed bank fraud in real-estate deals. Their trial is set for early November.

The indictment was not immediately available, but Burnette's Tallahassee defense lawyer Tim Jansen said he faces nine charges, including fraud, extortion and making false statements, all of which he “adamantly denies.”

“I’ve reviewed the indictment and we are going to categorically deny all charges and set the case for trial so he can exonerate himself,” Jansen said outside the U.S. District Courthouse on Adams Street.

Burnette turned himself in at about 11:30 a.m. today at FBI headquarters in Tallahassee. He will have his first appearance before a judgetoday in U.S. District Court in Tallahassee, where grand jurors have been meeting for many months in the corruption probe.

Burnette, 42, and some of his businesses were named in subpoenas served on City Hall in June 2017, when news of the undercover investigation broke. Later, a photograph taken in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2016 surfaced of Burnette posing with Maddox, several undercover agents and a little person entertainer.

The back story:

►44 COUNTS: FBI indicts Scott Maddox and associate Paige Carter-Smith on corruption charges

► A TANGLED WEB: A look at those under the microscope of federal investigators and their connections to the city, businesses and each other.

Federal prosecutors alluded to Burnette in the Maddox indictment, referring to him as a local real estate developer and entrepreneur called Person G, who interfaced with both the commissioner and undercover FBI agents posing as real estate and medical marijuana entrepreneurs.

According to the Maddox indictment, one of the agents spoke with Burnette in July 2016 about Company F, an FBI front company believed to be Southern Pines Development. The company’s purported projects needed sign-off from the City Commission and possible grants from the Community Redevelopment Agency. Burnette told the agents Maddox was the most powerful member of the CRA.

Two months after that meeting, Burnette again met with a representative from the FBI front and others. During the meeting, Burnette allegedly agreed to secure Maddox’s support for a potential project in exchange for a percentage of the deal.

“Person G said that Maddox would be able to support the project by committing official acts such as convincing other commissioners to support the project,” the indictment says. “Person G stated that the amount that Company F would need to pay Maddox through the lobbying firm would increase based on the difficulty of authorizing the project.”

Burnette told the undercover agent that as an example, Company F might need to pay Maddox’s firm $10,000 a month for perhaps as long as three years if the value of the benefit to the company was $3 million.

Not long after that, around Oct. 1, 2016, the Company F representative told Maddox that Burnette recommended he meet with the commissioner. During that conversation, Maddox referred to Burnette as “my guy.”

During subsequent meetings in October 2016, Burnette and an undercover FBI agent agreed that Company F would pay Maddox $10,000 a month. Burnette confirmed the payments were “definitely for Maddox” and that there was “nobody else” at Governance besides Carter-Smith, “which is Maddox, effectively,” Burnette said, according to the indictment.

Scott Maddox and J.T. Burnette are pictured with at least three undercover FBI agents. After internal discussions and conversation with the FBI, the Democrat decided to blur the faces of the undercover agents and three unidentified individuals. (Photo: Special to the Democrat)

Burnette went on to say that Maddox “wanted to keep his conversations narrowed to one person” and that he could talk to the commissioner about how he wanted to receive payments through Governance. He said Maddox wanted to limit his “inappropriate conversations” to only one person, Burnette.

Around Oct. 29, 2016, Maddox met with an undercover agent and agreed to perform official acts to benefit Company F. During the meeting, Maddox allegedly directed the agent to send a $10,000 payment to Governance.

In December 2016, Maddox accepted a chartered jet flight to Las Vegas, along with a hotel room and meals, all paid by Company F, according to the indictment. It's believed the hotel room photograph of Maddox, Burnette and the undercover FBI agents was taken during the trip.

That same month, Carter-Smith sent the company a contract in which Governance would provide marketing and government consulting in exchange for $10,000 a month for a year.

881,Real Holocaust victim's life 'relived' as millennial on Instagram,"Railway tracks leading to the main gates at Auschwitz II - Birkenau. (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images)

“It’s 1944, and Nazis have conquered most of Europe … They do terrible things to us Jews … I’m about to turn 13 — finally.”

If that wasn’t a common diary entry for every pre-teen Jewish girl during World War II, it was for Eva Heyman, and the creator of a new Instagram account is determined to show what Eva's life was really like, in a way that her peers now could relate to: through Instagram.

Many of us are familiar with Anne Frank, but Eva was also a real person who endured the tragic life of being a Jew in the 1940s.

She began journaling her life on her 13th birthday, Feb. 13, 1944. She died on Oct. 17, 1944, as one of six million Jews killed at the hands of Nazis in the Holocaust.

An Israeli tech executive, Mati Kochavi, created the Instagram account as an innovative way of getting millennials who are attached to their phones and social media to engage in Holocaust education as the last of the survivors are dying out, according to The New York Times.

Kochavi and his daughter, Maya, created the project that went live on Israel’s annual Holocaust Martyrs’ and Heroes’ Remembrance Day.

In 70 short episodes, Eva, played by a British actress, takes followers with her on her Holocaust journey. And these are based on real entries from a real diary by a real girl.

We witness Eva, through the Instagram posts, go from a happy, imaginative and fun-loving young woman to a scared, lost and hopeless girl.

She talks about her crush and wanting to be a news photographer when she grows up.

Then, as she and her best friend are playing one day, before things get really bad, a man walks past them, spits on the ground and mumbles, ""Dirty Jew.""

""I'm surrounded by war, but I'm always seeing the sun."" -- Eva

As we begin nearing the end of Eva's journey, once the Nazis begin to take over her community, her tone changes drastically.

“You are so lucky that you cannot feel what terrible things are happening to us ... I so much want to live,” she says as she cries.

In her last post, Eva is put on a train to Auschwitz.

The project then ends with a glimpse into the life and death of the real Eva Heyman.

Kochavi's project has received a ton of support, including an endorsement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and plenty of Instagram followers (there were 1.6 million followers of the page as of Tuesday).

""What a great idea. 👏 Thank you for this. I am a teacher in Germany and will bring that to my students,"" one Instagram user said.

And another responded to one of the posts, ""I think this is great idea to ensure also the younger generations remembers the holocaust!!!""

But the project has not come without criticism.

Some Israelis say the use of “selfie culture” and the use of hashtags and emojis to try to simulate life during the Holocaust is cheapening and trivializing that period of history.

Regardless, Kochavi said he spent several million dollars on the project because the Holocaust needs attention from today's youth.

“The memory of the Holocaust outside of Israel is disappearing,” Kochavi said in an interview with The New York Times. “We thought, 'Let’s do something really disruptive.' We found the journal and said, ‘Let’s assume that instead of pen and paper, Eva had a smartphone and documented what was happening to her.’ So we brought a smartphone to 1944.”

After searching through about 30 young people's journals from the Holocaust, Kochavi and his daughter chose to tell Eva's story because of something very ""modern and relatable"" to her.

""I have no doubt in my mind that young people around the world want to have serious content and be connected in the right way,” he said.

882,Documents detail 'severe injuries' in abuse of toddler,"The mother of a 2-year-old girl noticed injuries to her child every time she left her alone with her live-in boyfriend.

Leon County Sheriff’s Office investigators were made aware Monday of a possible child abuse incident when the girl was transported to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare with severe injuries.

Her brain was bleeding in two places. She had liver lacerations. Both her ears were bruised. She had cuts and abrasions on her hip, face and arms.

The girl’s mother, 26-year-old Heather Reid, was arrested after being questioned by detectives. She faces charges child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm.

She told detectives she heard a thud come from the other room and believed the girl had fallen out of bed. After answering that only she and another man were at the house, she backtracked and said that her boyfriend, Clayton Pafford, was also home.

She said Monday was not the first time she noticed the child with injuries.

“She noticed every time she leaves (her) alone with Clayton, she would return home and discover more injuries,” according to court records.

Reid said she didn't report previous injuries she believed were connected with Pafford because she was worried the toddler would be taken by the Florida Department of Children and Families.

The friend told LCSO he heard the same thud but that Reid wasn’t at the Crossway Court house when it happened. He saw Pafford, 23, come out of a bedroom with the toddler’s, bloody limp body. Pafford began calling Reid instead of for medical help.

The friend called 911 as Pafford left the home saying, “Don’t tell anyone I was here.”

Pafford, 23, was arrested Tuesday after leading law enforcement officials on a chase through Woodville. He faces charges of child neglect, aggravated battery on a child, kidnapping, hitting a police dog, kidnapping, aggravated assault of a police officer and multiple other charges stemming from fleeing officers.

LCSO deputies, along with members of the U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force and the Florida Highway Patrol, searched for Pafford all night. He was finally located at about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday driving on Back Forest Road by a member of LCSO’s Special Projects Investigations Detection Enforcement Response Unit and members of the Florida Highway Patrol. When they tried to stop him, Pafford refused to stop and fled.

Persuing deputies and troopers used stop sticks in the southbound travel lane of Old Woodville Highway, but Pafford swerved toward the deputy onto the St. Marks bike trail, narrowly missing him. Pafford turned back onto Old Woodville Highway and crossed over Bob Miller Road before troopers were able to stop his vehicle, LCSO reported.

Pafford, who had a passenger in his vehicle, refused to surrender. A LCSO K9 was used to take him into custody and after being treated at a local hospital was taken to the Leon County Detention Facility.

The couple was investigated by DCF last month when hospital staff noticed the toddler’s injuries.

In mid-April, staff at Capital Regional Medical Center noticed the girl was dirty, was covered in bug bites, had a bruise under her left eye and a bald spot on her head. The girl had a burn on her right hand and lesions on her body. Staff members overheard Reid making alarming statements about not being about to take care of the girl and not caring if she was eating.

884,"Lonely 6-year-old's 911 call becomes teachable moment, bond with Tallahassee police officer","A 911 call from a lonely 6-year-old boy could have ended with stern discipline instead of a stuffed animal and perhaps a budding friendship.

The boy, who's name hasn't been released, said his mom was ""mean"" and made him cry, according to the 911 call. The dispatcher stayed on the line and asked him several questions, including his age, address and where were his parents, who were unaware their son called 911.

Tallahassee Police Officer Joe White was en route when the boy called a few more times to make sure an officer was coming. Once he arrived, the boy asked if he and White could be friends.

The Tallahassee Police Department posted on Facebook pictures of White and the boy holding a stuffed animal given by White. The officer informed the boy of when to use 911.

TPD spokesman Damon Miller told the Tallahassee Democrat the social media post was made by another public information officer so he couldn't confirm whether White made contact with the boy's parents before the post was made public.

Steve Harrelson, director of the Consolidated Dispatch Agency, said it's rare that a child calls 911 because they're lonely.

Here’s Officer Joe White's his new friend, who called 911 because he was lonely. (Photo: Tallahassee Police Department)

""Realizing he was a child, we put some extra attention to that,"" said Harrelson, who urged parents to teach their children about 911. ""It was a great conclusion to an incident that could have been a lot worse. (White) used that moment to educate the uses of 911 ... It worked all the way around for everyone.""

Miller said White did what most officers do every day, but most people don't know about. He said it's not unusual for officers to have similar encounters with children.

""He let the young man know that they can be his friend and how to use the 911,"" Miller said. ""This is a classic example that we are humans as well, and we are not robots.""

885,Documents detail 'severe injuries' abuse of toddler,"The mother of a 2-year-old girl noticed injuries to her child every time she left her alone with her live-in boyfriend.

Leon County Sheriff’s Office investigators were made aware Monday of a possible child abuse incident when the girl was transported to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare with severe injuries.

Her brain was bleeding in two places. She had liver lacerations. Both her ears were bruised. She had cuts and abrasions on her hip, face and arms.

The girl’s mother, 26-year-old Heather Reid, was arrested after being questioned by detectives. She faces charges child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm.

She told detectives she heard a thud come from the other room and believed the girl had fallen out of bed. After answering that only she and another man were at the house, she backtracked and said that her boyfriend, Clayton Pafford, was also home.

She said Monday was not the first time she noticed the child with injuries.

“She noticed every time she leaves (her) alone with Clayton, she would return home and discover more injuries,” according to court records.

Reid said she didn't report previous injuries she believed were connected with Pafford because she was worried the toddler would be taken by the Florida Department of Children and Families.

The friend told LCSO he heard the same thud but that Reid wasn’t at the Crossway Court house when it happened. He saw Pafford, 23, come out of a bedroom with the toddler’s, bloody limp body. Pafford began calling Reid instead of for medical help.

The friend called 911 as Pafford left the home saying, “Don’t tell anyone I was here.”

Pafford, 23, was arrested Tuesday after leading law enforcement officials on a chase through Woodville. He faces charges of child neglect, aggravated battery on a child, kidnapping, hitting a police dog, kidnapping, aggravated assault of a police officer and multiple other charges stemming from fleeing officers.

LCSO deputies, along with members of the U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force and the Florida Highway Patrol, searched for Pafford all night. He was finally located at about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday driving on Back Forest Road by a member of LCSO’s Special Projects Investigations Detection Enforcement Response Unit and members of the Florida Highway Patrol. When they tried to stop him, Pafford refused to stop and fled.

Persuing deputies and troopers used stop sticks in the southbound travel lane of Old Woodville Highway, but Pafford swerved toward the deputy onto the St. Marks bike trail, narrowly missing him. Pafford turned back onto Old Woodville Highway and crossed over Bob Miller Road before troopers were able to stop his vehicle, LCSO reported.

886,"Gulfshore Playhouse in Naples ends season with play ""Skylight""","CLOSE Amy Blackman and Todd Weeks rehearse Skylight at Gulfshore Playhouse Morgan Hornsby, morgan.hornsby@naplesnews.com

Ever wonder what it would be like to run into your ex? That dream or nightmare, depending on how it all went down, is played out in ""Skylight"" as two former lovers rehash and recriminate three years after their torrid love affair.

All the while drinks are poured, a table is set and dinner is served in the more than two-hour Gulfshore Playhouse production, the last one of the 2018-19 season.

More about Gulfshore: In tight quarters, Gulfshore Playhouse’s plans for new downtown Naples theater advance

More: Review: Gulfshore Playhouse Holmes thriller full of twists, humor

The Tony Award–winning play, written by British dramatist David Hare, is playing at the local theater until May 19. ""Skylight,"" which first premiered more than 20 years ago, has been revived a handful of times, most recently in 2015 at the Golden Theater in New York City starring actors Bill Nighy and Carey Mulligan.

Todd Weeks and Amy Blackman rehearse Skylight at Gulfshore Playhouse in Naples on Tuesday, April 30, 2019. (Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

At first glance, ""Skylight"" seems like a simple play. There are only three characters, two of which are alone onstage for most of the play, which takes place in a modest London flat.

The complexity lies in the main characters and their history. Memories are all Kyra Hollis (played by Amy Blackman) and Tom Sergeant (Todd Weeks) seem to have left in ""Skylight."" They ruminate, debate and butt heads as they unpack their six-year affair when Tom pays Kyra a surprise visit one cold winter night three years after the fact.

Today, he's a self-made entrepreneur, who recently lost his wife and the business he spent decades building. She's a young schoolteacher, who said goodbye to her privileged past to join the working class. At first, it seems as though the two have nothing in common, except for their past, but, as cliché as it sounds, opposites attract.

She's around 30 years old and Tom is nearly 50. He wears a handsome, expensive suit, she a simple sweater and jeans. He has a driver and she takes the bus. Their differences are obvious, especially when Tom continuously interjects his disapproval of her humble flat with a heater that doesn't heat. But the attraction is still there — in their eyes, in their body language.

But this reunion isn't necessarily a happy one.

The former lovers debate everything from politics and economics to, of course, their past. All the while, Kyra is cooking spaghetti over a real stove — making things even saucier. Blackman is gifted in the art of multi-tasking. She chops onions and spills dry spaghetti into a boiling pot without missing a beat. Weeks is stellar at playing a seemingly self-assured man, who is really just a man with a broken heart.

Six years of their closeted, extramarital affair is unpacked onstage. How they met: Tom was a hotel and restaurant entrepreneur on the rise. Kyra answered a “waitress wanted” ad at one of his restaurants where they met and somehow she became a part of the family unit with Tom’s wife Alice and their young son Edward.

And how it ended: Alice discovered love letters Kyra wrote to Tom causing Kyra to flee. Alice subsequently died of cancer leaving both Tom and his teenage son (played by Evan Sibley) to fend for themselves.

""Skylight"" is all about language, not so much action, though there is some utensil-throwing. The tension between the two characters is palpable as they move about the kitchen and living area like two boxers sizing each other up before a fight.

Though they are essentially strangers to one another, you can't help but root for them and hope they can find some common ground.

888,Off The Beat: Fort Pierce man learns dangers of wearing sibling’s pants,"FORT PIERCE — There can be dangers associated with wearing your brother’s pants.

Jeffery Junior Davis (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY FORT PIERCE POLICE)

Jeffery Junior Davis, 59, of Fort Pierce appears to have learned that the hard way, according to an arrest affidavit.

The April 19 case began about 8:17 p.m. when Fort Pierce police say a Ford Explorer didn’t come to a complete stop at North 24th Street and Avenue E.

More: Beer ‘brewhaha’ doesn’t skunk investigators

Police stopped the Ford and spoke to the driver, identified as Davis.

Davis told investigators he didn’t have a license.

He further said the tag on the Ford didn’t belong to it, and that he put it on so he could drive to the store.

In light of the alleged license and tag infractions, it could be said Davis was caught with his pants down.

More:Man says he's 'too fat' for DUI test

Police searched Davis and reported finding a small amount of crack cocaine in a pocket of his pants, a garment that covers the body from the waist to the ankles.

“Man, these are my brother’s pants,” Davis is quoted as exclaiming.

Davis likely needed this encounter with police like a kick in the pants because he was arrested on charges of cocaine possession and driving while license suspended.

890,Teen suspect in deadly Palm Coast shooting to be tried as adult,"PALM COAST, Fla. - A 17-year-old indicted on a first-degree murder charge in the death of a Palm Coast high school senior will be tried as an adult, the State Attorney’s Office has decided.

“It is a somber reality of our job that sometimes requires the charging of juveniles in adult court -- but some acts are so violent and have such little regard for the value of human life that the perpetrator has to be held accountable with adult consequences,” State Attorney R.J. Larizza said.

Marion Lee Gavins Jr. was indicted Friday in the shooting death of 18-year-old Curtis Gray in April.

Gray was shot just after midnight April 13 in the parking lot of a strip mall on Belle Terre Parkway in Palm Coast, according to deputies. Gray died at a hospital, and deputies arrested Gavins the next day when he turned himself in.

Sheriff Rick Staly said he fully supports Larizza’s decision.

“Sadly, this is a young man who exhibited increasingly violent behavior that ultimately caused another teenager’s death,” Staly said. “Being tried as an adult is the most appropriate way to prosecute this crime.”

Flagler court records show Gavins was previously arrested on charges of:

Selling marijuana near a school at 13 years old, in 2014

Violation of probation and possession of a weapon -- an 8-inch kitchen knife -- in 2015

Domestic violence toward his mother, in 2016

Violation of home detention, in 2016

Gavins, who is currently being held by the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office at the Duval County Jail, will be returned to Flagler County when he turns 18 on May 16.

Tim Roush, 56, of Jacksonville, was in Kansas April 28 when a deer jumped out from the side of the road and hit the front wheel on the left side, Pratt Tribune reports.

A GoFundMe account set up for Roush said he underwent surgery after MRI results revealed he had three crushed vertebrae in his neck.

He also has a broken leg, broken ribs and has pain in his arms and issues lifting them.

Roush was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.

Roush and his wife are still in Kansas, with Tim in the ICU, but are trying to get back home to Jacksonville. Friends of the family reached out to News4Jax about the accident.

""The problem that is against them is that the insurance company is only going to pay for Tim to be transported to the nearest facility in Lincoln, NB and will not cover for Tim to come home to Jacksonville to our Spinal Rehab Facility where Tim and Sabrina would be surrounded by family and friends who could help support them.""

BIG COPPITT KEY, Fla. - A Big Coppitt Key man was arrested Sunday afternoon after he beat up a woman and threw her into a canal, authorities said.

According to Monroe County Sheriff's Office spokesman Adam Linhardt, a deputy arrived to 9 Riviera Drive around 1 p.m. to find the 44-year-old victim bleeding profusely from the head and with multiple bruises throughout her body.

Linhardt said the woman told the deputy that Calvin Joseph Teal, 38, beat her, threw her down onto the floor and then threw her into the canal.

A neighbor told the deputy that Teal was asleep inside the home.

The deputy went inside the home and saw blood on the floor, ""a large amount of bloody paper towels in the kitchen trash can and a blood trail leading down a hallway to a bedroom where Teal was sleeping,"" Linhardt said.

Authorities said the victim was taken to the Lower Keys Medical Center on Stock Island, where she told a second deputy that Teal had hit her in the head with a conch shell before he threw her into the canal.

Teal was arrested. Authorities said they found a bottle of 34 Xanax pills that he didn't have a prescription for while he was being booked into jail. Teal faces charges of aggravated battery, possession of Xanax without a prescription and smuggling contraband (Xanax) into a detention facility.

A motive for the attack is unclear.

PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Pasco County father is facing an aggravated assault charge after deputies explained that he pointed a gun at a person for allegedly driving dangerously around his daughter's school bus.

Deputies arrested 43-year-old Daniel Carroll on Tuesday in Port Richey.

According to an arrest report, Carroll followed the victim to his home Tuesday morning then got out of his car and started yelling at the man. Deputies say Carroll yelled that the victim was putting his daughter in danger.

""Apparently, he made a turn in front of the school bus while it was stopped and he thought that was maybe too dangerous,"" said sheriff's spokesman Kevin Doll.

The victim said Carroll told him he was not going to ""get away with this,"" the arrest report says. Carroll is accused of then pulling a gun out and pointing it at the victim before getting back in his car and driving away.

Deputies later met up with Carroll, who told them he was upset because several people had been speeding past his daughter's bus stop. The arrest report says Carroll admitted to following the victim to his home to tell him not to speed past the stop.

Carroll told deputies the victim balled his fists and charged at him aggressively, the arrest report says. Deputies say the dad told them he pulled his gun out and backed away as the victim yelled to shoot him.

The arrest report says Carroll admitted what he did was wrong. He was arrested for aggravated assault.

""I've seen people chase down people around school buses and yell at them and argue with them, but never follow them to their house to pull out a weapon and threaten them that way,"" Doll said Wednesday.

906,Woman creates bulletproof hoodies for all ages due to widespread shootings,"EAST PALO ALTO, Calif. - A woman whose neighbor was shot and killed in an attempted robbery has started a company that makes bulletproof hoodies to keep people of all ages safe.

The California company, Wonder Hoodie, produces the bulletproof protection in smaller sizes for young children and teens after the rash of school shootings in the U.S.

Vy Tran, 25, says she came up with the idea after her neighbor was killed in front of their home and she couldn't find protective gear for her mother or brother.

Wonder Hoodie products meet the requirements for body armor by the National Institute of Justice. The company also sells bulletproof jean jackets, vests and other accessories, reports KTRK.

All of the company's bulletproof products can protect people from weapons such as a .44 magnum.

""We only use dupont kevlar and a newer version of their kevlar, called kevlar xp,"" said Tran. ""They're rated as 3A, which is the highest level of protection you can get from soft body armor.""

Tran says one man bought a hoodie for his wife, who is a teacher. Another customer bought one to feel safe to go to the movies.

907,Murder suspect with ties to Naples Park representing himself as trial begins in Sarasota,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com. Wochit

The suspect accused of killing a man and dumping his carpet-wrapped body at a Naples Park home in October spoke calmly as he represented himself at a Sarasota County courthouse Tuesday morning.

Daniel Davenport, 31, of Sarasota, faces a second-degree murder charge related to the killing of Sergio Hostins, 55, of Sarasota.

He also faces charges of grand theft of a motor vehicle, 10 counts of fraudulent use of personal identification information and unlawful possession of four or fewer identities.

Davenport was arrested in Orlando in October 2018 after eluding authorities for more than a week. He was booked at the Orange County Jail in Orlando and extradited to Sarasota County, where he has been held without bond.

Davenport wore a gray suit with a red tie and was required to stay within the boundaries of black duct tape on the carpet of Courtroom 4A when talking to the jury or questioning witnesses during the trial.

In early April, a judge approved Davenport’s motion to represent himself.

Assistant Public Defender Gino Lombardi sat next to Davenport during the trial Tuesday as his stand-by counsel.

Davenport would be allowed to ask Lombardi questions only about court procedures if he wanted to continue representing himself, 12th Judicial Circuit Court Judge Stephen Walker told him before jurors entered the courtroom Tuesday.

Previously: Tracing a crime: Sarasota man slain; body found in Naples Park; suspect arrested in Orlando

Davenport’s opening statement was filled with objections from assistant state attorneys prosecuting the case. It started when Davenport asked jurors to take their duties serious because “a man's life depends on it.”

After Walker sided with the prosecutors, Davenport and asked the jurors to keep open minds during the trial. He referred to himself as the defendant and Hostins as the “alleged victim.”

""The defendant is being accused of taking a man's (Hostins’) life for his credit cards,” Davenport said.

He is a business man, a home owner and the idea that he would take a man’s life for his credit cards doesn’t make any sense, Davenport said.

Assistant State Attorney Kennedy Brandon Legler told the jurors he wouldn’t be able to tell them exactly why, where or when Hostins was murdered.

""What I will tell you and what will be crystal clear at the end of this trial is that (Hostins) died literally at the hands of the defendant Daniel Davenport,” Legler said.

Hostins was strangled, stripped, then wrapped in a comforter, trash bags, insulation, more carpet and which was duct-taped shut before he was stuffed in the back of his car and driven around for a few days. He was then dumped at a home in Naples to bake in the hot sun, Legler said.

“That is what this man, Daniel Davenport, did to Sergio Hostins in October of 2018 when he threw him away like a piece of trash,” Legler said during his statement.

The timeline of the days following and leading up to Hostins’ death would prove Davenport's guilt, Legler told the jurors.

In September of 2018, Hostins and Davenport first met and began chatting on a social media app for gay men, called Grindr.

They developed a casual dating relationship, Legler told the jurors.

Evidence would show a neighbor heard a verbal confrontation she thought was coming from Hostins’ apartment the day before Hostins failed to show up for work as a waiter at an Italian restaurant on Oct. 3, Legler said during his opening statement.

From around that date until Davenport’s arrest on Oct. 19, 2018, Davenport was spotted multiple times driving Hostins’ car and using Hostins’ debit and credit cards throughout Florida, Legler said.

Hostins loved his green Subaru Forester and everyone knew the distinct vehicle belonged to him, Legler said.

Davenport asked his brother-in-law, a commercial fisherman, how far he would need to go out to get rid of something and said he needed to dispose of a body on Oct. 7, Legler told the jurors.

A man, who hired Davenport for tree removal services at homes in Cape Coral and Naples, took notice of a rolled-up carpet in the back of the green Subaru Forester Davenport was driving later that same day, Legler said.

Evidence in the trial would show that Hostins’ body was found the morning of Oct. 9, by contractors who came to work on renovating a home, Legler said.

This home was in in the 700 block of 102nd Avenue North in Naples Park and was the same home from which Davenport was hired to remove trees, the prosecutor said.

Fingerprints on trash bags and pieces of insulation that wrapped Hostins’ body matched Davenport’s, Legler told the jury.

Davenport was connected to a home in the 200 block of Pelican Road in Venice. Evidence would show the same types of insulation, trash bags, duct tape and carpeting used to wrap Hostins’ body were found in the home, Legler said.

During his opening statement, Davenport admitted to having a romantic relationship with Hostins.

“The evidence will show you that like most romantic relationships the alleged victim would let the defendant use his credit cards as well as loan him his car periodically,” Davenport said.

Davenport said he also has evidence that he was not at Hostins’ apartment on Oct. 2 when the neighbor thought she heard a verbal confrontation.

Text message records prove that Davenport was with his wife at a poker tournament that night, Davenport said.

“I’m confident that the evidence will prove I’m innocent,” Davenport said. “There is no doubt in my mind everyone here will agree.""

The trial was at the Judge Lynn N. Silvertooth Judicial Center in Sarasota and began Monday with jury selection. It is expected to last six or seven business days, said Assistant State Attorney Karen Fraivillig.

The couple declined to reveal their identity in fear of retaliation but they showed News 6 pictures of what the man's throat looked like yesterday and where they found the line, tied from a fishing dock to a tree at the Joyce Ebbins Fishing Pier and Observation Deck.



""He literally could have been decapitated. If we were going faster like we normally do and it wasn't raining,"" said the woman. ""There's no way this could have been somebody's fishing line that got hung up on the dock and they just walked with it because it would be laying on the ground. It was strung up around neck height on purpose.""



The couple notified Ormond Beach police who are now investigating the incident.

The woman said it hasn't stopped them from riding their bikes on Monday, but said they'll be extra careful and warns others to be as well.

Police said Rodriguez rolled down the window and Nino attempted to hit her but missed.

Rodriguez warned Nino that she had pepper spray and that he need to get back, authorities said.

Police said he eventually retreated toward his car after she told him to get back numerous times.

According to the arrest report, Nino slapped Rodriguez's hand after she got out of her SUV to take a picture of his driver's license.

His wife then pulled him away from Rodriguez and the couple got back into their car and drove away, the report stated.

A police officer arrived at the scene a short time later and Nino eventually returned and spoke with the officer, authorities said.

Police said Nino claimed Rodriguez was the one who struck his car and that she tried to flee the scene of the crash.

Authorities said the two passengers in Rodriguez's SUV were interviewed and they both substantiated Rodriguez's series of events.

Nino was then arrested on charges of burglary, assault and battery. His vehicle was towed from the scene due to his wife not having a valid driver's license, authorities said.

918,Sentencing for drug dealer charged in overdose death,"<p>An Orange Park man convicted of selling the drugs that led to a woman's fatal overdose will be sentenced in federal court Monday.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a federal jury found Trumaine ""Lucky"" Muller guilty of selling heroin and fentanyl, among other charges. Investigators said Ariell Brundige, 18, her boyfriend and another man went to Muller's apartment and bought what they thought was heroin in 2016. But that heroin turned out to be fentanyl.</p>

<p>Brundige died of an overdose the next morning. Prosecutors said toxicology results showed Brundige had well over the lethal amount of fentanyl in her system.</p>

<p>Her boyfriend, Tyler Hamilton and that second man, Christopher Williams, were charged with manslaughter in the case and pleaded guilty last year.  </p>

<p>The State Attorney's Office had previously charged Muller with first-degree murder, but the case was moved to federal court and the murder charge was dropped.</p>

921,Florida inmate escapes custody after faking chest pains,"- First, he got the attention of police by breaking into businesses and cutting holes in roofs and walls. Now, he is in trouble for an attempted escape while playing sick.

On Wednesday, the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office said that an inmate, 28-year-old Teddy King, faked chest pains. He was taken to the Melbourne Regional hospital. After doctors said he was okay, King bolted for the trees and hopped out of a wheelchair with his hands still cuffed and nothing on his feet.

“Then on the way out, he said he was too weak to walk, he was being wheeled out in a wheelchair, with cuffs, and once they got outside the perimeter of the building, he took off,” said BSO Spokesman Tod Goodyear.

Brevard County Sheriff's Office got back up from the West Melbourne Police and their search dogs scoured the woods. He was eventually found and taken back into custody.

“I believe he went in, he kind of just laid down, he was probably hoping that we wouldn’t find him, that we would leave, and then he could walk out,” Goodyear recapped. “And now he has an escape charge on top of the charges he was facing before that.""

During the manhunt, a West Melbourne police officer was bitten by a Melbourne K-9. The department says that this is not a serious injury though.

King pulled off a string of high profile burglaries in late January and February. Police say he used 'Spider-man' tactics. For example, he scaled a wall, cut a hole in the roof, and made more holes in the walls to steal from storage units behind a cell phone repair shop in Melbourne.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/florida-inmate-escapes-custody-after-faking-chest-pains,2019-04-26T00:16:10Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
922,Florida deputy seen punching suspect who is handcuffed to a hospital bed,"- The Broward County Mayor is calling for a criminal investigation after surveillance video showed a Florida deputy punching a suspect who is handcuffed to a hospital bed.

The video shows a Broward County sheriff's deputy punching a man handcuffed to a hospital bed and unable to get away. The body camera was resting on a nearby surface and showed Deputy Jorge Sobrino punching 26-year-old David O'Connell and bending his arm backward. O'Connell screamed in pain.

The incident occurred back in January when O'Connell was arrested at a Pompano Beach Walmart for a domestic disturbance. He was also charged with resisting arrest without violence. The incident led Deputy Sobrino to bring him to Broward Health North for treatment, but O'Connell apparently refused.

""I don't want to be here, I don't want to be here, I don't want to be here, I want to sign off!"" O'Connell is heard saying in the body camera footage.

Deputy Sobrino wrote in his arrest report that the defendant ""intentionally placed his hand on my upper chest and against my will and pushed me, therefore committing a battery against my person.""

However, the video does not support that claim. At one point, the deputy is heard on the body camera recording and admitting to throwing to at least one punch.

O'Connell was originally facing three charges, but the most serious one has since been dropped.

923,"Florida Time: Racism, resentment and injustice against Black Floridians","We’ve said that Florida is now the most “northern” of the southern states. Its Jewish and Hispanic populations are among the largest in the nation and each boasts its own diversity.

The state has had Hispanic members of the U.S. House and Senate as well as regional and state elected officials from every ethnic group imaginable. A lieutenant governor and the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor were African-American.

But in the late 1800s and early 1900s, Florida was fiercely Southern. And like much of the South, to its shame, deeply embraced Jim Crow.

So what was the extent of Jim Crow in early 20th century Florida?

There were people who didn’t look like the Pilgrims and who hadn’t come voluntarily. The end of the Civil War was supposed to have made them full citizens. That ideal slammed head-on into the reality of racism and resentment.

It wasn’t just separate water fountains and restrooms, which this writer remembers seeing as a child in Miami in the 1960s. That was mild. From 1918 to 1927 alone, 416 blacks were lynched nationwide. Of those murders, 47 were in Florida.

And while lynchings are one thing, massacres are something else.

On New Year’s Day of 1923, a 22-year-old white woman named Fannie Taylor told the sheriff in Levy County, west of Ocala, that a black man had assaulted her. Soon a mob of between 400 and 500 people was searching the woods around Rosewood, a community of about 300 black families. After seven days of violence, six blacks and two whites had been killed and Rosewood had been burned to the ground.

A 1993 investigation commissioned by the state would call it “a tragedy of American democracy and the American legal system.”

As dramatic as that massacre was, another incident became nothing less than a sideshow of the Cold War.

In 1949, four black men were accused of raping a white woman outside Groveland, in Lake County, north of Orlando. One man was killed by a mob a few days later. The other three were tried and convicted. After the St. Petersburg Times published articles showing distances and timing that made the men’s guilt physically impossible, and when future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, then with the NAACP, stepped in, a retrial was ordered. The Lake County sheriff drove to the prison to get the boys and shot two of them while they “escaped” as he changed a flat. One died. The surviving two were convicted again. One served 19 years, one 12. The Soviet Union would gleefully make propaganda hay, arguing freedom-loving Americans were hypocrites.

Other individual miscarriages of justice against black Floridians are too numerous to mention. And that’s the ones we know about.

931,1 dead in STEM school shooting outside Denver,"HIGHLANDS RANCH, Colo. (WFLA/AP) - At least one person is dead after a shooting at a STEM school outside of Denver, according to KUSA.

That person's identity has not been released.

Initial reports said eight students were admitted to hospitals.

A shooting at a suburban Denver middle school injured seven people Tuesday, and two suspects were in custody, authorities said.

KUSA reports the suspects are one juvenile boy and an adult man. Officials said they believe both are students at the school.

According to KUSA, the shooters walked into the school and engaged students in two seperate locations.

Lines of firetrucks, ambulances and law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies were at the school and medical helicopters landed on a grassy field.

The shooting occurred at the middle school at STEM School Highlands Ranch, a public charter with more than 1,850 students in kindergarten through 12th grades.

The sheriff’s office said deputies responded around 1:50 p.m. to the school in the Highlands Ranch community about 15 miles south of Denver.

Nicholson-Kluth said police and deputies got there almost immediately and heard shots as they arrived. The school is near a sheriff’s department substation.

The driver of a semi was taken to a hospital in stable condition after the big rig he was driving crashed into a guard rail on Interstate 75 north of Ocala late Monday night.

A Florida Highway Patrol trooper on scene said the 54-year-old Citrus County man was taken to Ocala Regional Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries. His name was not initially released.

He had to be pulled from the truck by Marion County firefighters using the Jaws of Life device to rescue him.

The truck was northbound on I-75 in the left lane when, for unknown reasons, the driver veered onto the west shoulder and took out about 100 feet of guard rail. The semi tipped over on the driver's side, trapping the man.

He was hauling 41,000 pounds of bananas, troopers said. The cargo remained intact.

Two other vehicles were struck by debris. Those drivers were not injured.

The crash occurred near Mile Marker 360, roughly eight miles south of the County Road 318 interchange.

PARKER COUNTY, Texas -

A Texas man discovered a human femur bone that is believed to be nearly 800 years old, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.

>> Read more trending news

Parker County resident Scott Fuller was fishing along the Brazos River on March 22 when he saw the bone floating about a foot from shore, according to WFAA.

""I'm still wrapping my mind around it,"" Fuller told the television station. ""I thought this could be a drowning, this could be a murder mystery.”

It was neither. The bone was identified and tested by a forensic anthropologist, Bryan Wright, an investigator in Parker County, told the Weatherford Democrat.

“She realized that the bone was probably ancient and took a sample to a lab in Florida, and they did a carbon-14 dating on it and it came back to be about 800 years old,” Wright told the newspaper.

The bone belonged to someone who died between 1286 and 1398, the forensic anthropologist said.

“The carbon-14 date shows the bone to be from 1286 to 1398 A.D. with a 95.4 percent accuracy,” Wright told the Democrat. “So the Indian that that bone belonged to was here before (Christopher) Columbus discovered North America. It was 200 years before that, even.”

Parker County Sheriff Larry Fowler told the newspaper the bone likely belonged to a Caddo Indian.

Now, Fuller is wondering who the person was.

""Just every thought goes through my mind,"" Fuller told WFAA. ""I would just love to hear from them. I'd love to talk to them and learn more.”

938,Clermont man on trial in hit-and-run death,"TAVARES — When Aaron Zacharias was struck by a hit-and-run driver on Dec. 6, 2015, he suffered injuries as severe as if he had fallen from a four-story building, a pathologist testified Tuesday.

“It was significant force,” said Dr. Wendy Lavezzi, deputy chief medical examiner for the 5th Judicial Circuit, which includes Lake County.

Lavezzi said Zacharias' spinal column was “transected” and his brain stem was torn in two. He had a broken femur, hemorrhages to the head and abrasions, she said. The prosecutor also had her hold up the victim’s clothing so the jury could see what he had been wearing.

“He wouldn’t have been able to get up and walk around?” asked Assistant State Attorney Jason Nimeth.

“No,” she replied.

David J. Sheets, 52, of Clermont, faces charges of failing to stop for a crash involving death, a first-degree felony, and leaving the scene of an accident with property damage, a second-degree misdemeanor.

He told Florida Highway Patrol troopers that he thought he might have hit a deer or “zoned out” and hit a mailbox at 11 p.m. while traveling south on Lakeshore Drive. He said he stopped and went back to the area but could not see anything, according to the investigative report.

FHP investigators concluded that 26-year-old Zacharias was crossing Lakeshore near Preston Cove Road when he was struck by a vehicle. FHP found pieces of Bondo, a material used to repair dents in vehicles. They also found the pedestrian’s flashlight, which was turned on, a cellphone and other items.

Investigators concluded the collision vaulted Zacharias 55 feet from the point of collision and his right shoe more than 73 feet.

Two days after the crash, Lake County Sheriff’s Deputy Bret Rutzebeck called FHP and said his friend, Sheets, called him and told him he had read a news account of Zacharias’ death.

Sheets met the deputy and a trooper in his driveway and said, “I believe this is the vehicle the Florida Highway Patrol is looking for.”

The trooper noticed the dented area in the black 1968 pickup truck where the Bondo had been knocked loose, and other damage.

Sheets said he drank two or three beers that afternoon — about five hours before the crash. He said he had driven to a storage unit in the minutes leading up to the accident.

939,Men face felony murder charges in fatal shooting outside McDonald's,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - Two men have been arrested in connection with a shooting outside a McDonald's last month that left a man dead and a woman injured, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies announced Tuesday morning the arrests of Shaddrick Wright, 20, and Deon Justice, 19, on first-degree felony murder charges.

The shooting happened April 25 at 12:14 a.m.outside the fast-food restaurant on North Pine Hills Road.

The victim, 19-year-old Jamario Dixon, and his brother went to the McDonald's to sell a gun to Justice, documents show. Justice and Wright both shot at the vehicle Dixon was in, hitting him in the shoulder, according to the report.

Deputies said surveillance video showed Justice and Wright running away after the shooting. At least nine shots were fired, the report said.

Dixon's brother drove him to Orlando Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

Wright's 19-year-old girlfriend, who was driving the Volkswagen Jetta in which the two suspects arrived, was also shot in the back of the head during the shooting, records show.

Deputies said Wright moved her from the driver's seat to the passenger's seat then drove her to his mother's house and his mother drove her to ORMC. The story Wright provided deputies did not match with the surveillance video and forensic evidence recovered from the scene, the report said.

Both men are being held at the Orange County Jail without bond.

941,Record tiger shark caught near Marco Island,"Mark Stock landed what he said is a record class tiger shark on April 25 while fishing off Marco Island with charter Captain Ben Olsen. The creature measured 14 ½ feet.

The current state record is a 1,065-pound tiger shark measured at 12 ½ feet and caught out of Pensacola waters in 1981. Stock’s shark was estimated to weigh more than 1,100 pounds, but its exact weight will never be known as it was immediately released.

Olsen said he’s caught tiger sharks exceeding 12 feet but “this shark was truly special, and our number-one priority was to get her released in good shape, as quickly as possible.”

Beth Deacy, a biologist with NOAA Fisheries Panama City Lab and head of its shark-tagging program, told Stock that based on this shark’s length in comparison with similar sized tigers, she would most likely put its age between 15 and 20 years.

943,Emotional 911 calls released in shootout that killed 7-year-old girl,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The State Attorney's Office on Monday released audio of 911 calls made moments after a shootout that killed a 7-year-old girl in August.

Heidy Rivas Villanueva was caught in the crossfire that unfolded in the parking lot of a Westside strip mall after a botched robbery, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. Heidy was shot in the head and did not survive.

Editor's Note: This story contains graphic details that some may find upsetting.

People nearby called 911 for help. One caller said they saw her father carrying the girl's body and screaming.

""Lord have mercy. I'm on 103rd (Street). I just heard some gunshots in the parking lot. I don't know what happened. But I saw this man go in the car, it look like he grabbed his child. They're gonna have to send the police out here,"" one 911 caller can be heard saying.

Later in that call, a 911 operator asks, ""Do you know if that child was shot?""

""It seemed like it. He was just holding her. She seemed lifeless. He was holding her and just running and screaming, running and screaming,"" the caller replies.

Another person also called 911 to report the shooting on 103rd Street.

Operator: ""You said someone's been shot?""

Caller: ""Yeah. There's a kid that's been shot. There was a shooting.""

Police said Trevonte Phoenix and Abrion Price had arranged a gun sale near the strip mall, but had actually planned to rob the buyer. They ended up trading gunfire with Stanley Harris, a friend of the buyer, police said.

Investigators said a bullet from Harris' gun struck Heidy, killing her. Because police said Phoenix and Price were committing a crime when Heidy was killed, they were each charged with felony murder, under Florida law. Harris is charged with third-degree murder.

Phoenix pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last month. Before that, a fourth man, Edward Garcia, who was charged as a getaway driver, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to a first-degree felony. Both are awaiting sentencing.

Price and Harris have pleaded not guilty to their charges. They are awaiting trial.

TAMPA (WFLA) - In the world of fast food, there are a lot of players. But Chick-fil-A is a restaurant on a roll.

Gus Mir is a man who got in on the ground level. He opened his first Chick-fil-A restaurant at 22 years old in Pinellas County.

Mir would go on to open another restaurant years later. Little did he know that Chick-fil-A would explode in popularity.

""Well, we've experienced really unprecedented growth for our company,"" he said. ""The cornerstones are just a great restaurant experience, great quality, served by great people.""

Chick-fil-A could become the 3rd largest fast food chain in America in sales within the year, according to several reports.

So, as you can imagine, many want a piece of the action.

And while the cost to become a franchisee isn't too excessive, there is something that may stand in the way of someone opening one of the coveted locations.

""It's very competitive. Sometimes it's harder to get into the C.F.A (Chick-fil-A), than the C.I.A because of their selection standards,"" he said.

But once a new location goes up, look out. These restaurants operate at an intense level of speed to help meet the demand of hungry customers.

""We're serving about 140 guests in the drive-through in one of our peak hours,"" he told us. ""That's a car at the window every 24 seconds.""",https://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/bay-area-man-talks-about-secrets-to-running-a-successful-business/1984131808,2019-05-06T22:16:45Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
945,"Former Ormond Beach officer tried to hide drugs in pants after crash, deputies say","PALM COAST, Fla. - A Florida man who identified himself as a former police officer after being involved in a crash is facing charges of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies said they were called to the intersection of U.S. 1 South and Seminole Woods Boulevard in Palm Coast Sunday afternoon after a crash with injuries was reported.

When deputies arrived, they found Brenton Hodge, 55, in the driver's seat of a blue Nissan Altima, which had damage to its rear end, according to a report from the Sheriff's Office. A silver Mercedes was found nearby with damage to its front end, the report said.

A deputy at the scene approached Hodge and found him messing with a cooler in the floorboard of the car, according to the report. The deputy said Hodge smelled of alcohol and was slurring his words.

When the deputy asked Hodge what was in the cooler, Hodge replied, ""Nothing,"" according to body camera video from the crash scene.

“Where were you drinking at? “This car reeks of booze, man,” the deputy said.

When the deputy asked why, Hodge said it was because he was taking his trash out earlier and it had a lot of beer cans in it that leaked onto his seat, the video showed.

When the deputy continued asking about the crash and why Hodge's vehicle smelled like alcohol, Hodge told the deputy he was drinking earlier in the day but was just sitting at the intersection with his blinker, waiting to make a U-turn, when the driver of the Mercedes hit the back of his vehicle.

A witness at the scene said it appeared that Hodge had his left blinker on and was trying to make a U-turn but was in the middle or right turning lane.

A short time later, Hodge identified himself as a retired Ormond Beach police officer, deputies said.

“I know where you’re going. I’m a retired cop.” Hodge told the deputy as he flashed what the Sheriff's Office said was a badge.

When getting out of the Altima, Hodge grabbed a bag of what deputies believed was marijuana and tried to shove it down his pants in front of them, the report said.

“Trying to shove weed down your pants? Are you kidding me?” the deputy said.

Multiple beer cans, including some that had been opened, were found in his vehicle, deputies said.

Hodge, whose airbags were deployed, then told deputies he wanted to go to the hospital, after initially telling one deputy he did not need medical attention, the video showed.

He was taken to Advent Health to be treated for his injuries before being booked into jail on charges of marijuana possession over 20 grams and driving under the influence, deputies said.

The driver of the other vehicle was also taken to the hospital to be treated for injuries, deputies said.

Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly said regardless of Hodge's being a retired officer, he would still be held accountable for his actions.

""As a former law enforcement officer, he should be well aware of the dangers of drinking and driving. It is disappointing that he thought he could manipulate the situation by showing our deputies his retired badge and trying to [stuff] his drugs down his pants,"" Staly said. ""None of his tactics worked. If you drink and drive in Flagler County, you will go to jail. No exceptions, no excuses.""

(Photo: Dorothy Edwards/Naples Daily New)

Deliberations in the case of an East Naples man accused of impaired driving and killing a woman in a 2014 crash began at the Collier County Courthouse Monday.

Kiereek Seymour, 29, of East Naples, was charged with DUI manslaughter after an early morning crash at Lakewood and Davis boulevards in East Naples on May 19, 2014.

Sandra Marie Maddux, 54, of East Naples, died from injuries suffered in the crash.

Collier Circuit Judge Joseph Foster declared a mistrial in the case in February after a juror came out of the jury room during deliberations and indicated she was feeling uncomfortable.

Jurors began deliberations around 4:30 p.m. Monday after the new trial began on April 22.

The trial included conflicting assertions about whether Seymour was driving the Jaguar, who was at fault in the crash and whether Seymour's blood-alcohol content was above 0.08, the legal limit for driving.

Assistant State Attorney Mara Marzano began her closing argument by telling the jurors that Maddux lost her life because Seymour was driving impaired due to the alcohol and alprazolam he had in his system at the time of the crash.

While Defense Attorney Peter Adrien said the state had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Seymour was driving the vehicle, was actually impaired or was at fault in the crash that killed Maddux.

Witness testimony proved Seymour was driving the vehicle involved in the crash with Maddux, Marzano said.

""There was never anyone else there,” Marzano said. “There was never any possibility that anyone else got out of that car and ran away.”

Seymour was found by witnesses positioned on the passenger side of the vehicle after the crash and it’s not the defense’s burden to prove who, if it wasn’t Seymour, was driving the vehicle, Adrien said.

Evidence collected by officers from the Florida Highway Patrol showed that Seymour was speeding and driving at least 62 mph at the time of the crash, while Maddux was driving 18 mph, Marzano said.

Adrien told the jurors the investigation by Florida Highway Patrol officers was not done properly and the speeds of the vehicles involved in the crash changed in various versions of the crash report.

Witness testimony also showed that Seymour had a yellow traffic signal and Maddux a red traffic signal, Adrien said.

In addition, Adrien said Maddux’s car had no lights on after the crash. Maddux could have been driving the dark vehicle at night with no lights, which could have contributed to the crash, he said.

However, Seymour’s slurred speech and medical records from the hospital after the crash prove he was impaired, Marzano told the jurors.

“Nowhere here does it say we have to prove he was falling down drunk,” Marzano said.

Seymour admitted to an emergency responder that he had a consumed one and a half beers before the crash and hospital staff recorded Seymour as clinically intoxicated and high, Marzano said.

The additive effect of alprazolam and alcohol impaired Seymour, Marzano said.

“I told you this was a complicated matter,” Marzano said. “I would suggest to you when you pare it down to what is real and not real you will find the defendant guilty.""

Adrien said none of the testing or evidence presented by the state proved that Seymour was over the 0.08 blood-alcohol level limit.

""The defendant is not guilty and this was a horrible accident,” Adrien said. “How could he be? He was following all the traffic rules.”

Even before February’s mistrial, Seymour had been in court before to face charges related to the crash that killed Maddux.

The state attorney's office refiled the DUI manslaughter charge in 2016 after then-Collier Circuit Judge Fred Hardt vacated an earlier plea agreement.

The negotiated plea agreement related to charges stemming from a Marco Island crash and charges from the crash involving Maddux. Hardt wrote that he had to vacate all sentences in the two cases.

TAMPA (WFLA) - A Weeki Wachee man has been arrested after deputies say, Jose Morales, 35, carjacked and crashed a man's vehicle with him in the back seat killing him.

Deputies say Morales walked up to Levesque's vehicle and got into the driver's seat with Levesque ending up in the back of the vehicle.

953,"Window-sticker arrest: Is it offensive? Sure, but obscene? Maybe not","""I think this falls under offensive speech, which is protected by the First Amendment,"" said First Amendment expert Clay Calvert.

A North Central Florida arrest has gained national attention, with most headlines tagging a pickup driver with an unyielding belief in the First Amendment as a “Florida man,” a colloquial term placed on eccentrics in the news.

Lake City's Dillon Shane Webb, 23, objected when a Columbia County sheriff’s deputy Sunday found a sticker on the back window of the man’s Chevy truck to be obscene and wouldn't alter it, even to get off the hook.

Columbia County Sheriff’s Deputy Travis English would later arrest Webb for possession of obscene material and resisting an officer, after he refused to take an “S” off the sticker to make the message road-worthy.

One University of Florida expert believes prosecutors will have a hard time proving English’s belief the sticker was obscene.

In white, block-style letters, the slightly off-centered message reads, “I EAT A**.”

Webb insisted that he has a First Amendment right to make the declaration.

Clay Calvert, a First Amendment expert and director of the Brechner First Amendment Project in the UF College of Journalism and Communications, said the sticker’s words may be offensive to some people, but in the opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, there’s a difference between offensive and obscene speech.

“It’s a words-only case, which is extremely rare. I think this falls under offensive speech, which is protected by the First Amendment.”

In court, Calvert said prosecutors would have to prove the sticker obscene through the Miller test, a standard used by courts to define obscenity.

The three-part test comes from the 1973 Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling in Miller v. California in which the court ruled that obscene materials did not enjoy First Amendment protections.

The first step in the Miller test is to determine whether the average person, applying “contemporary community standards would find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interests.”

In layman's terms, the prosecutor would have to prove that an average Joe would find the words almost pornographic, to be hard-core sexual conduct and that it appealed to “shameful or morbid interests in sex,” Calvert said.

Calvert's skeptical that Webb's case would make it past the first test. He said prosecutors would have a hard time proving the average person wouldn’t understand the sticker was meant to be a joke.

“I don’t think anyone is going to find this appeals to shameful or morbid interest in sex. It’s a three-word statement that intends to be amusing,” he said. “It might be sophomoric and offensive but I don’t think it’s obscene … I think it’d be best to not prosecute it.”

Sgt. Murray Smith, spokesman for the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office, said the office stands behind the deputy’s decision to arrest Webb.

“Every deputy has discretion in certain areas,” Smith said. “Our deputy believed this was a violation of state statute.”

Webb was arrested under Florida Statute 847.011.2, which describes violators as someone “who knowingly has in his or her possession, custody, or control any obscene book, magazine, periodical, pamphlet, newspaper, comic book, story paper, written or printed story or article, writing, paper, card, picture, drawing, photograph, motion picture film, film, any stickers, decals, emblem or other device attached to a motor vehicle …”

Obscenity cases where there is no imagery attached are extremely rare, Calvert said. The sticker being just three words would make it an even tougher case to prove.

For historical context, Calvert reflected back to an early 1960s case in which comedian Lenny Bruce was convicted of giving obscene comedic performances and sentenced to four months in prison.

Things have changed since then, Calvert said.

Smith said he isn't sure if the case will make it through the judicial system but that’s not the Sheriff’s Office’s job.

“Our job is not to interpret the law,"" Smith said. ""It’s our job to establish whether there is probable cause to make an arrest and he did.”

English gave Webb the opportunity to appear in court on the obscenity charge in lieu of an arrest but he refused, according to Smith.

“If he refuses, then you really have no other option but to arrest him,” he said.

Webb's truck was turned over to his mother, though Smith said English wanted to have the truck towed. He didn't want the message on the road anymore.

“We called a tow truck because we did not want the sticker to corrupt the public morals again,"" Smith said.

The truck was put on the tow truck but eventually taken back down after Webb paid a fee, he wrote on his Facebook page.

A reporter asked Third Judicial Circuit prosecutor John Durrett if he was aware of the case and if State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister plans to prosecute the case.

Durett let out a laugh like he’d heard a good joke, before saying no decision has been made on that front.

“You hear me chuckling but everything has to go through the normal process,” he said, still chuckling. “I mean, it's making friggin’ national news. We have to look at everything.”

Webb told The Associated Press he plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit with the Sheriff's Office. Asked Wednesday afternoon if he still intends to, he replied: ""Maybe.""

His next court date is May 23. The sticker, he said, is still on his truck.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190508/window-sticker-arrest-is-it-offensive-sure-but-obscene-maybe-not?rssfeed=true,2019-05-08T16:17:13Z,Gainesville Sun,Florida Man,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
954,DCA: No 'jurisdiction' over admittance of confession in Segura murder case,"CLOSE Henry Segura takes the stand in his own defense during the quadruple murder trial on Aug. 11, 2017.

An appeals court ruled it doesn’t have the authority to require a gang members' claim he is responsible for a 2010 quadruple murder to be allowed at the trial of the man accused of the crime.

In an opinion released Tuesday, the First District Court of Appeal wrote it did not have the jurisdiction over what evidence could and couldn’t be used in Henry Segura's upcoming trial.

The DCA dismissed the petition by Segura's attorneys to force the Second Judicial Circuit to allow the odd testimony of James Carlos Santos that he, from federal prison, ordered the murders Segura is charged with committing.

Segura, 40, has sat through 12 trial delays and one mistrial on charges he was responsible for the brutal November 2010 killing of his girlfriend Brandi Peters, her twin daughters, Tamiyah and Taniyah Peters, and their 3-year-old son JaVonte Segura.

He has remained in the Leon County Detention Facility for 2,765 days since his arrest in 2011. He was set to stand trial last month but the case was continued.

On the eve of Segura’s first trial in August, Santos claimed Peters was killed in a drug cartel hit that he orchestrated.

A series of threatening emails exchanged between Peters and Santos in the days before she was killed show she was concerned about her involvement with Santos, the Chicago-based gang, the Vice Lords, and the Los Zetas cartel, according to Segura’s attorney Nathan Prince and Santos’ testimony. Peters is purported to have been running Colombian cocaine for the Mexican cartel and skimmed close to $90,000 of her loads.

With Santos’ testimony, Segura could be acquitted. Without it, he likely faces another mistrial, one of his attorneys Michael Ufferman contended.

The DCA judges agreed the particulars of the case warranted a closer look, but could not rule on the potential impact of the evidence.

“Segura’s circumstances are indeed unusual,” the judges found. “But none grants us jurisdiction for the pre-trial review of disputed evidentiary issues. Neither pretrial detention nor the possibility of another mistrial constitutes the type of irreparable harm necessary (to support allowing the evidence.)”

Prosecutors allege Segura killed Peters and the children to avoid paying more than $20,000 in back child support.

Santos invoked his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination at Segura’s first trial and did not take the stand. In letters sent to Leon Circuit Judge James C. Hankinson that have been filed in court records, Santos has expressed interest in testifying at Segura’s next trial.

961,Record Tiger Shark caught near Marco Island,"Mark Stock landed what he said is a record class tiger shark on April 25 while fishing off Marco Island with charter Captain Ben Olsen. The creature measured 14 ½ feet,.

The current state record is a 1,065-pound tiger shark measured at 12 ½ feet and caught out of Pensacola waters in 1981. Stock’s shark was estimated to weigh more than 1,100 pounds, but its exact weight will never be known as it was immediately released.

Olsen said he’s caught tiger sharks exceeding 12 feet but “this shark was truly special, and our number-one priority was to get her released in good shape, as quickly as possible.”

Beth Deacy, a biologist with NOAA Fisheries Panama City Lab and head of its shark-tagging program, told Stock that based on this shark’s length in comparison with similar sized tigers, she would most likely put its age between 15 and 20 years.

A Sunday bike ride through an Ormond Beach park was anything but pleasant for a woman and her boyfriend.He said he rode right into a fishing line, tied off between a dock and a tree, that was at neck height.The man said he had to fall off his bike to avoid a possible life-threatening injury.The couple alerted police, who took a report and suggested it might have been homeless people in the woods using fishing line to dry clothes, but the couple feels certain this was no accident.""I'm lucky to walk away. It's just scary to think that something like that is out here,"" the man said.The man and his girlfriend asked WESH 2 News not to show their faces since they ride bikes in Central Park almost daily, and fear reprisal for sounding the alarm. But the victim showed WESH 2 News his neck with an angry red mark along his throat where fishing line tied across a path near the Joyce Ebbets Pier caught him. He had to fall off his bike to save himself.""It was burning, like somebody was like, taking fishing wire or something like that trying to decapitate me the whole time,"" he said.""All of a sudden, he goes down to the ground and I see the line come up out of his neck,"" the man's girlfriend said.His girlfriend shared a picture on social media with an arrow showing where the fishing line was located -- fishing line with a hook attached. It had rained, so the pair weren't riding too fast. If they had been riding faster or if the test line had been thicker, she thinks the outcome could have been far more serious.""He could have gone right through it, and it could have taken his head off in all reality,"" she said.Both are sure the fishing line was placed along the path deliberately.It was intentional. There's no way that this could have been somebody's fishing line that got hung up on the dock and they just walked with it because it would have been laying on the ground. It was strung up at neck height on purpose.:Police did a search and didn't find any more possible booby traps.The couple just wants other people in the area to be aware. The couple said if a child ran down the road toward the pier and scenic outlook and encountered fishing line, they could really be put at risk.They rode the path on Monday and found no obstacles.",https://www.wesh.com/article/bicyclist-injured-by-fishing-line-ormond-beach/27383499,2019-05-07T12:20:00Z,WESH-TV,Florida Man,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789

964,"Deltona homeowner holds suspected burglar at gunpoint, deputies say","DELTONA, Fla. - A Deltona homeowner held a suspected burglar at gunpoint until authorities arrived, according to deputies.

The break-in was reported Saturday in the 600 block of Deltona Boulevard.

According to a Volusia County sheriff's incident report, the homeowner said he was awakened by the sound of breaking glass and discovered a man, later identified by officials as Michael Jiminez, in his home.

The homeowner said he got his 9mm handgun and told the man to leave and fired a warning shot into the ceiling because the man didn't immediately comply, according to deputies. The homeowner said he was in fear for his life, the incident report said.

Jiminez dropped to the ground when the gun was fired, and the homeowner called 911, deputies said.

Jiminez said he believed he heard a woman screaming for help inside the home, which used to be a business owned by someone he knew, according to authorities.

Jiminez said he broke a window with a pocketknife and entered the home, according to officials.

Deputies said Jiminez had a backpack containing hypodermic needles and cut straws, all of which tested positive for methamphetamine.

Jiminez was arrested on charges of armed burglary to an occupied structure, possession of amphetamine, possession of methamphetamine, possession of narcotics paraphernalia and criminal mischief.

No one was injured in the incident.

971,Sen. Marco Rubio reportedly confirms Florida elections office intrusion by Russians in 2016,"ORLANDO — Sen. Marco Rubio confirmed Friday there was an intrusion into Florida’s elections systems by hackers in 2016, according to The New York Times.

Rubio, R-Fla., would not say who was behind the hacking, saying he was constrained by his position on the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the redacted version of the Mueller report released April 18 stated the FBI believes “at least one Florida county” was infiltrated with malicious software sent out by Russian intelligence agents.

Rubio’s statement contradicts the Florida secretary of state’s office, which maintained last week that its elections systems weren’t hacked. Secretary Laurel Lee also said at the time that the FBI hadn’t told the state which county they believe was compromised.

Rubio said the information was discovered through an intelligence operation, not a criminal investigation,

“Everybody has been told what it is they need to do to protect themselves from the intrusion,” Rubio told the Times. “I don’t believe the specific victims of the intrusion have been notified. The concern was that in a number of counties across the country, there are a couple of people with the attitude of: ‘We’ve got this; we don’t need your help. We don’t think we need to do what you are telling us we need to do.’”

The hackers, were “in a position” to change voter roll information, he told the Times, but it didn’t appear they did.

Last year, then-Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., warned that Russians had gained access to Florida voter data but declined to identify which county or counties had been penetrated, saying the information was classified. No other officials backed up Nelson’s claim, including Rubio, and his opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, and national Republicans attacked Nelson for what GOP campaign emails called his “alarming claims” and “extremely reckless behavior.”

Rubio did warn repeatedly in 2016 that “state election systems are potentially vulnerable to Russian cyberattacks.”

Gov. Ron DeSantis had said at a press conference in Orlando last week that he didn’t believe any breach would have affected vote totals.

But in Miami on Thursday, according to Politico, he was critical of the FBI, telling reporters, “They won’t tell us which county it was, are you kidding me? Why would you have not said something immediately?”

DeSantis and now Sen. Scott, who defeated Nelson, will meet with the FBI in coming weeks to discuss the Russian hacking attempts on Florida counties in 2016.

Scott’s office said the FBI has reached out to him and is working on scheduling a briefing in the next few weeks. DeSantis’ office said no date has yet been set.

The report stated that in November 2016, Russian intelligence officials “sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election.”

The emails contained an attached Word document with malicious “Trojan” software that would have permitted Russian intelligence to access the infected computer. But none of the 52 Florida counties that had contracts with VR Systems, the Tallahassee company that was allegedly impersonated, has admitted to opening that document.

Volusia County elections supervisor Lisa Lewis said Thursday the office opened one of the infected emails in 2016, but not the infected attachment. Broward County Supervisor Peter Antonacci said this week the county received the email, but it was quarantined by anti-virus software and officials wouldn’t have had the opportunity to open the attachment.

No matter the offense he's facing, Drew Parrish has been on a tear lately.

The Florida State pitcher continued his recent success with another stellar outing in Friday's series opener against Wake Forest.

The junior held the Demon Deacons -- who entered the weekend 13th in the country averaging 8.1 runs per game -- to no runs on three hits over seven innings of work.

After a slow start, the FSU offense showed out and the Seminoles (27-14, 13-9 in ACC) cruised to a 13-2 win over the Demon Deacons (25-18, 11-11 in ACC) in front of a crowd of 3,840 fans at Dick Howser Stadium.

""Looking at their stats before the game yesterday, I was shocked. They had some good numbers up there and I knew they were going to be a great ball team to compete against,"" Parrish said.

""I knew I had to be on my 'A' game.""

The win is FSU's eighth in its last nine games. The Seminoles need just two wins in their final eight ACC games to clinch at least a .500 conference record.

On the Mound

After a rough start to his 2019 season, Parrish has looked as good as he has across his time at FSU over his last three starts.

With his seven scoreless innings against the Demon Deacons, Parrish hasn't allowed an earned run over his last three starts, a span of 21 innings. That shutout streak has lowered his earned run average from 6.21 to 3.99.

""It took a long time. I just had to believe in myself, believe in my process, just keep battling and working out there,"" Parrish said.

""It's starting to click.""

Parrish struck out 10 Wake batters and issued just one walk. He never let a baserunner reach third base.

""I see a guy that is showing great leadership as he continues to work to get better,"" FSU head coach Mike Martin said.

""Tonight was about as good as it gets...This young man, obviously, we all know he can pitch.""

Clayton Kwiatkowski was tagged for two unearned runs in the eighth inning before Chase Haney closed out the inning and pitched a scoreless ninth.

Around the Horn

After failing to score in the first two innings and scoring just once in the opening four frames, FSU broke it open from there.

The Seminoles plated eight runs across the fifth and sixth innings to turn a once-close game into a one-sided beatdown.

FSU took advantage of a Wake pitching staff that is not the strength of the team, amassing 13 hits and 10 walks.

Freshman outfielder Robby Martin hit a two-run homer in the fifth, his second of the season and his first since Feb. 23 against Youngstown State.

Cooper Swanson's seventh homer of the season -- a two-run shot off the scoreboard in the eighth -- padded the lead late.

Outfielders J.C. Flowers and Elijah Cabell had two-run singles of their own as well.

Through seven innings, FSU was error-free and on the verge of its first clean fielding game since April 12 against Clemson. Two eighth-inning errors and another in the ninth prevented the Seminoles from closing it out.

Up Next

After winning just two of its first five conference series, FSU is one win away from clinching its third consecutive ACC series.

The Seminoles will get their first chance at it Saturday at 2 p.m. C.J. Van Eyk (5-3, 4.14 ERA) will get the start for FSU against Wake Forest's Jared Shuster (4-2, 6.18 ERA).

974,Florida man is Best Buy's oldest employee,"Bob Kaufman, 89, said his favorite thing to do is to get to know his customers and build a relationship with them.

Fifteen years ago, Bob Kaufman was shopping at Best Buy on South Tamiami Trail in Sarasota with his wife when they noticed a kiosk promoting working for the company.

Kaufman, who was 74 at the time and retired, certainly had the relevant experience to get a job at the big-box electronics retailer. After all, he's been working on computers since 1958 — back when they were the size of tables and used punched cards for program creation and storage. Even still, Kaufman said he was unsure that Best Buy would hire an associate in their 70s.

""I said, 'Look, I'm 74 years old. They're not going to hire me, I'm too old.' And of course I was wrong,"" he said. His wife encouraged him to apply, and the rest is history.

Today, 15 years later, the Sarasota sales associate at the University Town Center store is the oldest employee in the entire company. On Sunday, April 7, he celebrated his 89th birthday.

Related: This Florida man is the greatest investor you've never heard of

Kaufman was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, and grew up in Newton, which is right outside of Boston. After serving stateside in the Air Force Reserves during the Korean War, he worked for a family business where he sold automotive accessories and other merchandise like toys, lawn and garden supplies and electronics in 35 stores across New England. He eventually went into data processing, where he did payrolls and installed computers.

Around the time he retired at age 62, he did work on the side with a data processing company he started with someone else. They processed surveys sent to companies in the printing industry. He's been in Sarasota for 25 years.

He thinks he probably wrote thousands of computer programs back in the day.

""Computers were the size of these desks,"" Kaufman said, gesturing to the rectangular folding table in the Best Buy break room where we were having our interview. ""I can still remember somebody telling me, 'You know, some day they're going to have a computer on a desk,' and I said, 'I'll believe it when I see it.' This was even before they had tape drives, before they had disk drives and all of that.""

At Best Buy, he originally worked in the appliance department at the store on South Tamiami Trail, selling things like refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers and microwaves. Back then, if you wanted to sell computers, you had to be able to lift them, which he wasn't able to do. But that has changed, and today, his colleagues are happy to help him with the physical tasks he can't do on his own.

He transferred to the University Town Center store seven years ago and went into the computing department. Theoretically, he said, he can sell anything in the store.

""Somebody will come in and I'll greet them, and they'll say, 'You sold me a refrigerator 12 years ago.' I'll say, 'How did you like it?' and they'll say, 'Oh, we love it,'"" he said.

Among his colleagues, Kaufman said he is just one of the guys.

""Employees love working with him. You would think some of these younger kids would not want to pick up the physical aspect of what he can't do, but they don't,"" General Manager Bobby Borges said. ""They really truly enjoy working with him because I think he sets the example for all the younger kids today.""

Kaufman generally works about 12 hours a week, but he's always looking to work more, Borges said. He's also curious about learning as much as he can about new products and other things — he knows how to say ""thank you"" in 26 languages.

""When you think of our line of work, it changes more than anybody else, in retail. Not only do we all have to stay on top of it, for a gentlemen who has other things going on in his life, he's still looking, he's still hungry,"" Borges said. ""He wants more info, he's always asking for anything he can get. That's a breath of fresh air for someone who is doing it because he wants to versus he has to.""

Kaufman said his greatest joy is getting to know the customers. Everybody who comes into the store has a story to tell. Whenever he meets someone new, he asks for their name and gets to know them. They're there to buy, and he's out to help them buy what fits their needs, rather than pushing them toward any specific product.

He said he's kind of amazed at the buzz his status as the company's oldest employee has generated. The day of our interview, a co-worker told him that a blog post from Best Buy about his status as the oldest employee was being shared around the internet.

The thing is, Kaufman said, he likes what he does. He could be sitting back at his house watching television, but he doesn't want to do that.

""When you're 89 years old, how many people are you going to meet and make friends with and learn about? This way I meet hundreds of people — I just enjoy it,"" he said. ""People come in and say 'What are you doing working at your age?' I say, 'This isn't work.' You get to talk to people, I get to share a bit of my knowledge. This is what I do for fun. The nice thing is getting paid. That doesn't hurt, but it's not my primary objective, obviously.""

Of course, if the mistake was obvious, I would not label what I knew to be a deer a hippopotamus, but the vast variety of wildlife; birds in particular, leave me flailing for identifying names.

Take a look at the guide to North American birds sometime; my, Lord, the difference species of buntings, sparrows and wrens would make one dizzy.

Anyway, last week, we, I, published a photo that was identified, by one of the top submitters for that page, as three snowy plovers on the beach.

I never thought another thing about it until a member of Barbara Eells’ army of turtle and shorebird volunteers zipping over a message noting that the birds were in fact sanderlings.

And, he added in so many words with a metaphorical elbow to the ribs, did I really want to disappoint Ms. Eells in such a way.

This, of course, for me ratcheted up the mistake by degrees.

Ms. Eells is, she would be horrified, I am sure, one of my local heroes.

One of those people who goes about her day with a deep well of faith and a passion beyond any passion I have known for the wildlife of this area.

She cares for her community, the one outside your doorway, like no one other and her dedication is something this community should get around to honoring one of these days.

She can spot and identify a bird and take personal ownership on the spot.

She is not just a league of her own, she is the major leagues.

And, to top that off, it was just a year ago that Ms. Eells allowed me on one of her morning nesting shorebird surveys and we were looking for the nests of a snowy plover.

I should know that Sanderlings are the little birds one sees feeding in the surf, not all that shy but not a bird you can get near.

If you have seen a snowy plover, far shyer, that is a treat.

As for today, there are four fledglings on a section of beach Eells likes to keep secret and I will honor that.

Last week, there were five new chicks from two nests.

She spotted two chicks swimming across a creek, photos of which are here.

But there are also quite a few birds missing since the storm, including “my old man and another male and female I usually have for nesting,” Eells said.

The hope is they show up in a data base somewhere in Florida.

My hope is she will accept my apology; plovers and sanderlings, I at least know the difference between those two.",https://www.starfl.com/news/20190509/plovers-sanderlings-and-knowing-difference?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T23:37:40Z,"The Star, Port St. Joe",Florida Man,"101 W Hwy 98, Port St Joe, FL 32456, USA",FL,32456
976,Triumph members urge county caution on golf course,"Count current Triumph Gulf Coast board member and former Florida Speaker of the House Allan Bense as no fan of Gulf County pursuing the purchase of a golf course.

His fellow Triumph board member Lewis Bear, Jr. has had some words of caution.

The board of Triumph Gulf Coast met last week and approved more than $5 million in grants to Gulf County.

The largest grant, for $4.27 million, came from a Triumph fund established to help the four counties most-impacted by Hurricane Michael with potential property tax losses.

In the final language of the grant proposal, the Triumph board included language that expressly barred the county from using any grant funds in the proposed purchase of a golf course.

And the board did so after some pointed criticism from Bense and later Bear.

Initially the Triumph board approved funding only 50 percent of any ad valorem or property tax shortfalls, but officials from Wakulla and Franklin counties would not be applying for hurricane relief funds from Triumph.

So, at last week’s meeting the Triumph board approved disbursing the remaining relief fund dollars to Gulf and Bay counties on a pro-rated basis based the original grant amounts.

Jason Shoaf, Gulf County’s representative on the Triumph board, asked when estimates of tax shortfalls would be certified and was informed they would be by July 1.

Assistant County Administrator Warren Yeager was asked to the podium to discuss how the county would disburse the additional dollars, Yeager noting the original application was for 50 percent so the additional funds would bring local governments closer to “being whole” from Hurricane Michael tax impacts.

Bense quickly turned the discussion to reports of the Board of County Commissioners pursuing the purchase of St. Joseph Bay Golf Club.

“I’m not sure what possessed them to do that,” Bense said.

At its last regular monthly meeting the last week of April, the BOCC heard from Administrator Michael Hammond on the proposed purchase.

Hammond said county staff “have been in negotiations” with the country club and urged board support to “conclude” the deal while providing an outline of the deal.

That outline included a purchase price of the club’s current debt or $390,000, whichever number was lower, that would include all equipment, grounds, the restaurant and meeting room.

The county would hire an operator but would subsidize operations for three years at up to $100,000 per year.

Bense said half-a-dozen Bay County golf courses had recently closed and he had recently passed on being paid to assume ownership of another course.

And there was a very good reason for both.

“They (golf courses) don’t make money,” Bense said, adding that the course which he owns, Holiday Golf Club, makes money only because of the 25,000 rental units and condos within a short distance.

Bear said he was an officer at Escambia County country club for years and every year membership had to be assessed additional fees to meet maintenance needs.

In addition, Bear said he had “lost a couple of million (dollars)” as an owner or investor in golf courses.

“Tell me the Board of County Commissioners is not getting into that business,” Bense asked of Yeager. “I hope you are looking at the numbers.”

And, he added, the county receiving Triumph grant funding for property tax shortfalls while pursuing the purchase of a golf course did not “look real smart” and the “optics are not positive.”

Yeager emphasized the county did not have “ad valorem” dollars for such a purchase and was only contemplating the buy because the county had been approached by the club’s membership.

The county hoped to support tourism by purchasing the club and had a fifth-cent of bed tax generating to apply to the purchase.

“No matter what, ad valorem taxes dollars will not go into that (purchase),” Yeager said.

Given that, Yeager was asked if the county would be okay with the Triumph board ensuring the funds were not used on the golf course in language for the motion approving the grant.

“Absolutely, our board would not have an issue with that,” Yeager said.

Yeager characterized the county as “early in negotiations” with the golf club leadership on the purchase price as well as exploring whether the purchase was a legal use of bed taxes.

Fifth-penny dollars were already set aside for a project at the 10th Street ball parks, but Yeager said that project was now stalled.

Bense said the fifth-penny and property taxes were part of a similar coin to most people.

“Fifth-penny, ad valorem, to the working man that’s taxes,” Bense said. “I sure would caution you about a golf course.”",https://www.starfl.com/news/20190509/triumph-members-urge-county-caution-on-golf-course?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T23:37:40Z,"The Star, Port St. Joe",Florida Man,"101 W Hwy 98, Port St Joe, FL 32456, USA",FL,32456

(Photo: JOHN MINCHILLO/AP)

Larry Kelly always bets on his horses.

As general manager of the Payson Park Training Facility in Indiantown, Kelly tried to keep up the tradition for this year's Kentucky Derby, but he lost service on his iPad before the race. When he got back on the internet, it was too late to place his bet.

Maybe Kelly was jinxing his horses all along.

More: Initial Kentucky Derby DQ led to failed 4-year legal odyssey

Country House, Code of Honor and Tacitus, who were being trained at Payson Park right before the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, took first, second and third place in the race.

If Kelly had made the $336 bet he planned, he would’ve won $3,000.

CLOSE SportsPulse: In a historic finish, Country House won the Kentucky Derby after Maximum Security was disqualified. USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken breaks down the chaos. USA TODAY

“The consolation was to be very proud of Payson Park,” Kelly said. “The odds of those three horses being one-two-three all coming out of here just literally weeks ago is pretty amazing.”

Tacitus left Payson Park a month before the Kentucky Derby to head to a New York race, but the top two winners, Country House and Code of Honor, were training in Indiantown up until a week before they shipped out for the derby.

More: Opinion: Stop the Kentucky Derby fighting and work for solutions to fix horse racing

Just to have them finish in second, third and fourth places was crazy enough, Kelly said.

The circumstances were even wilder because the original first place winner, Maximum Security, was disqualified after an interference objection.

“When they took it down (Maximum Security's win), that was in its own right basically history,” Kelly said. “But then for Payson Park to have the one, two, three finishers — you have as good of a shot at winning the lottery.”

It would be rare for any training facility to occupy all three top spots, he said.

California, which likely has between 4,000 and 5,000 horses stabled between two training centers, has maybe five to six of them run in the Kentucky Derby — and one of those might hit the board.

More: Life remains normal for Kentucky Derby winner Country House

He noted a big exception would be California-based trainer Bob Baffert, who won the Triple Crown with American Pharaoh in 2015 and Justify in 2018.

Bill Mott, who lives in Palm City, was the trainer for first place Country House and third place Tacitus. Claude R. McGaughey III, who won the Kentucky Derby in 2013 with Orb — also out of Payson Park — was the trainer for second place Code of Honor.

“All of Martin County should be extremely proud,” Kelly said. “There’s a little bit of a lack of knowledge (about Payson Park).”

The training facility gets about 30 calls each month, many asking to come ride, but it doesn’t have horses for riding.

However, Payson Park is open to the public, he said. The horses train from Oct. 15 to May 15 every year, but the facility still is open on weekdays for people to explore even when the horses aren’t training.

“We don’t have much other than you’re just welcome to come and watch some of the best thoroughbreds in the world train,” Kelly said.

More: Kentucky Derby winner Country House won't run in Preakness

Payson Park, which has been voted one of the top training centers in the world, is well-known nationally and internationally in the horse racing realm.

It’s important for 2-year-old horses turning 3 to get sunshine because that’s their bone-strengthening year, Kelly said. Even when he used to race horses in New York, he always would send them south for the sun.

The Indiantown training facility is different from others because it limits the number of horses to 500 and doesn’t train year-round.

More: Analysis: Horse racing under microscope again with Derby DQ

“It’s unique in a way that it’s not overcrowded or overused,” Kelly said.

That appeal has attracted five of the top trainers internationally, as well as horses from across the world, including South Africa, Germany and Australia.

Even sheikhs and the Queen of England, who’s a friend of owner Virginia Kraft Payson, keep their horses in Indiantown, he said.

“They’re all expensive horses,” Kelly said. “They come here to get ready for these derby races.”

The training facility has a 1-mile dirt course track that’s been rated one of the best in the nation, he said. It also has a 7/8-mile turf course, which is unusual for training centers, and several miles of galloping trails that go out through the woods.

“It’s a place where people take their horse to get ready for the coming year,” Kelly said. “It’s just a spring training camp for the best.”

Kelly, who’s father was the first trainer at what was then the St. Lucie Training Center when it opened in the 1950s, had his eye on several Payson Park horses that looked promising this year.

“As we were coming close a couple months ago, a couple of them were up there in the points,” Kelly said. “It was like, ‘holy God man, we might have a couple run in the derby,’ which is cool.”

By the time of the Kentucky Derby, he thought all three horses had legitimate chances. Still, Kelly didn’t get too excited because every year brings horses that have the points, but seem too young and haven’t won enough races to do what he described as the equivalent of crawling into the boxing ring with Mike Tyson.

But it wasn’t a total shock to have winners out of Payson Park, which typically puts out horses that are major players in racing, he said.

The training facility has had winners in the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes.

“Our next goal will have to be to have a Triple Crown winner,” Kelly said.

""The Crazy Water Day"" by Ella Rose Briones

Let me describe a daft water fun day!

The day’s temperature was hot and humid.

My sister said, “Do you want to go play?”

I hopped up and made a pyramid.

“Look out,” screamed my Jack Russell Terrier,

“Yikes, there’s a baby shark on the next street.”

“Oh who cares,” Sis said, “the more the merrier,

but be careful or you’ll be its sweet treat.”

“Run fast, “cried my Husky, “it will get you!”

“No way, I want the excitement,” I said.

But when I saw the shark it just sang pew.

Mom yelled, “You are insane! Go to bed!”

I know this all sounds incredibly crazy.

It really is very surprisingly hazy.

""Yesterday’s Sonnet"" by Abby Lunsford

With paper in hand, I watch the sun rise;

The sun has gone down on my yesterday,

Marking the hardships the past years comprise

As I brush the sadness and pain away.

Looking forth from the past to what’s ahead,

Thinking of all I did and all I’ll do;

Of the things I wanted to do instead,

And all I did despite knowing the truth.

Now at the dawn I begin life again,

So sparkling and fresh, a tender new day.

And all the more as I pick up a pen,

I consider my new sonnet today.

My burdens laid down, I know I can say

I’m glad I let go of my yesterday.

""Misery"" by Vanessa Yunussova

Everyone knows that feeling of despair,

How you feel that you'll be blue forever,

When all you wish to do, is just sit there,

The thought that feeling glee is a never.

This feeling and I have become quite close,

I know this too well to act unconcerned,

Some people have their daily dreary dose,

Feeling that all this pain, they simply earned.

No one enjoys these melancholic thoughts,

Where you feel all empty on the inside,

And you believe all your heart does, is rots,

That joy is lost, regardless if you tried.

The thought that dismal is where you belong,

Fills your heard, but you must be extra strong.

Untitled by Liz Garone

In our youth we do not anticipate

Bliss lost along with ignorance we’ll find

Comes with the end of spring it is innate

Can opened eyes retain an opened mind?

Yet youth is like a flower yet to bloom

Left closed how can it show what is inside?

Left sealed a bud will not know of the room

It had to grow if only it had tried

But as a bud has petals all along

So do our minds with knowledge to be found

Need to taste the fruit called life is not wrong,

But rather the only way we are unbound

So growing up is just a way to bide

The child that we all still have inside.

""Siren Song"" by Thelonious Linford

...and as I floated on the tranquil sea

I came across a strange, small, floating isle

And there one lone young woman sang to me

Her voice stretched out, all men near to beguile

Her skin was soft and fair like brightest snow

Around her head her golden braids did twist

None other did my red heart want to know

Than this fair maiden; salt air and sea kiss’d

But something made her seem more siren like

Perhaps the scaly glint upon her skin

Or yellow teeth each sharpened like a knife

Which shone as her voice tried to draw me in

Thus warned, we set out 'cross the stormy brine

But even now she preys upon my mind

""Sonnet of Beckett"" by Aidan Monroe

To stand before the tyrant of nine kings

Beneath the confines of hallowed comfort,

Thy lord enslaves me through locks without keys

Lest I appeal to his home winter court.

His words will cut through my skin as if swords,

His posture transforms abodes into cells;

And those among him patrol 'bout the ward

directing their demands till I've been felled.

But what grand honors my king provides me:

To groom his fur coat and polish his crown;

Dependence unheard, affections unseen

His love makes this heart dare not let him down.

For never a storm born summer compare

A monster so loyal, brutish and fair.

""Gloriana"" by Bob Ferdinand

(an acrostic sonnet)

England’s great queen, fairest jewel of our isle!

Lady most gracious, whose praises we sing —

Inspire fair-flourishing Nature, while

Zephyrs blow sweetly in earliest Spring.

Abounding in virtue, temp’rate and wise,

Benevolent justice flows from her hands

Ensnaring the wicked, dishonor and lies

To strengthen and prosper all she commands.

Her beauty shines warmly, pure as the sun!

Timeless and radiant, heaven’s true light.

Unrival’d in glory, God’s Chosen One!

Dauntless she rises to take up the fight.

Our love and devotion grow stronger each year,

Renown’d Gloriana — queen without peer.

""One Fair Morn’"" by John Ryan Hall

One fair morn I found me in a forest

Beside a birch I imagined I would form

An arrow from it’s faithful inmost breast

I fancied that I would face the storm

Of those fierce darts that cause me dread

I decided I too would be armed

To strike the little demon of love dead

Only then could I be free from harms

Yet Jove’s imp scorned the image in my mind

And swiftly assigned your eyes to reside

Instead of those arrows only orbs I find

Thus he did all my engines deride

For how can I that deathless boy overcome

When I looked in your eyes and knew you’re the one.

"" Ah, Time Itself doth help us ably age"" by Thomas Robert Moore

(The title is from Line 9, a frequent Shakespearean “transition"")

Whilst young, n’er did I fret ‘bout growing old.

Yet Time doth boldly bring its storms and rain.

So soon learned I, one’s health’s worth more than gold,

As Time deals deftly Aging’s aches and pain.

My eyes and ears do fail me all too fast.

How can I win Life’s fickle flirt with Fate?

Or hope to cope, breathe breaths that long will last?

And find loud laughs, sweet smiles? And not too late?

Ah, Time Itself doth help us ably age:

We find the means o’er time to learn what’s real.

The very limits Life makes us engage,

Do bring near, All we see, hear, smell and feel.

We can embrace whate’er we treasure most.

Then, daily live that love we each hold close.

980,Lakeland police look for person who spray-painted 16 buildings,"- Lakeland police are looking for the person who spray-painted graffiti throughout a busy street. They believe at least 16 businesses were hit within a two-hour period.

Saturday night, between 9 and 11, police say a man walked north for two miles on South Florida Avenue, spray painting the word ""SOLOE"" and some profanities along the way.

Debra Haskell, owner of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Olive Branch said her sign was sprayed on both sides.

""Of course my heart sank,"" Haskell said. ""It's very disheartening as an independent business owner. We put our heart and our soul into our businesses.""

""I'm working probably 12 hours a day, 6 days a week to make my business go,"" Haskell said, ""and, somebody comes in without regard or thought to the businesses or what we do for the community.""

Continue reading below

It appears the tagger was working solo. Otherwise, his lookout might've advised him not to spray the very well-surveilled downtown bus terminal. Police hope someone recognizes him from the video.

Fortunately, Haskell was able to get the paint cleaned off. But for other small businesses, it can be a pricey fix.

""The businesses around here generally, we have a $5,000-10,000 deductible on our insurance,"" Haskell said. ""It would have been a couple thousand dollars if I had to replace those signs.""

Sean Lee, who rides the bus through Lakeland daily, enjoys the mix of historic charm and modern vibe within the city. He's disappointed that someone would try to ruin it.

""I feel very upset about it,"" Lee said. ""It's not a good thing to do, especially, with the beautification of Lakeland you know? I hope they catch the person who did this to make him pay for what he's done.""

Those who live in, or just love visiting Lakeland can't understand how anyone could do something so low.

""I hope whatever is going in that person's life, they do find help and they do find peace in their life,"" Haskell said. ""It's just unfortunate that they have such angst the local businesses.""

Police say the suspect appears to be a white male wearing a camouflage jacket with the words Levi’s printed on the sleeve and red tennis shoe. Please take a look at the photographs and if you know the identity of the suspect, call Detective David Sharrett at 863-834-8967.

984,Lake City man arrested over vulgar sticker on truck,"After being given a notice to appear, the driver refused to remove part of the sticker, citing the First Amendment. That's when the deputy arrested him.

A Lake City man with a crude sticker on the back window of his Chevy truck ended up in the Columbia County jail Sunday after he refused to alter the offending words, citing his right to free speech.

A Columbia County sheriff's deputy pulled the pickup over on U.S. 90 around 5:50 p.m. after seeing the sticker — which stated ""I EAT A**"" in white letters, according to an arrest report. The deputy considered the statement a violation of Florida obscenity laws.

The driver and owner of the truck, Dillon Shane Webb, 23, became defensive when the deputy explained why he had been pulled over.

""They're just words,"" he said, according to the deputy's account.

""I then asked Dillon how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words,"" the report says. Webb responded that it would be up to the parent.

The deputy issued a notice to appear on the obscenity violation, a second-degree misdemeanor.

Then, the deputy wrote, ""I allowed him to remove one of the letters from the word 'A**' so the statement would no longer be derogatory."" But, he said, Webb refused to do so, citing the First Amendment.

That's when the deputy arrested him on a charge of resisting an officer without violence, a first-degree misdemeanor, and took him to jail. The truck was towed.

Bail was set at $2,500, and Webb was released at 8:50 that evening.

VENICE, Fla. (WFLA) - The Sarasota County Sheriff's Office needs the public's help catching a burglar.

Deputies say the man pictured broke into four homes in Venice from April 26 and April 29 and may have used a blue crowbar to pry open door frames before entering the homes to steal electronics, cash, and jewelry.

The suspect is described as a black male with brown eyes and is believed to have long dreadlocks. Detectives believe he is approximately 6 feet tall and weighs 170 lbs.

A 2018 dark grey or silver Nissan Altima was also seen in the area where the burglaries took place.

Cruz works at Holmes Regional Medical Center and is charged with sexual battery.

Melbourne police said a patient first reported that the nurse touched her inappropriately during an examination last Thursday.

Detectives said the woman identified Cruz as the nurse who met her in a patient room with a second female nurse to conduct a ""skin assessment.""

When the second female nurse left the room a few minutes into the exam, the patient told detectives Cruz began to touch her inappropriately.

Detectives interviewed Cruz the next day and they say Cruz corroborated much of what the patient said.

He was arrested Monday.

989,'Serial convenience-store robbery suspect' sought,"- The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office is hoping to identify a man described as a ""serial convenience-store robbery suspect.""

The same suspect is believed to be responsible for four robberies at 24-hour stores in the south end of Deltona since February, plus possibly two more in Seminole County. In each case, the suspect either brandished a weapon or implied he had one.

The latest incident occurred around 2 a.m. Monday morning at the 7-Eleven at 839 DeBary Ave., Deltona. It’s believed to be the second time the same suspect robbed that store.

The other robberies in Volusia County occurred at a Circle K store 1712 Doyle Road and a Cumberland Farms store at 1251 Providence Blvd. No injuries were reported in these cases.

After each robbery, it’s believed the suspect left the store on foot. It’s unknown at this time if he eventually entered a vehicle or if he remained on foot.

The suspect is described as a black man, between 17 to 25 years of age, with a thin build, 5 feet, 8 inches to 6 feet tall, weighing 140 to 170 pounds.

If you have any information or additional surveillance footage that might lead to an arrest in these cases, please contact the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office at 386-860-7030 or Detective J.

990,Trump pardons former US soldier who killed Iraqi prisoner,"- President Donald Trump has pardoned a former U.S. soldier convicted in 2009 of killing an Iraqi prisoner, the White House announced Monday.

Trump signed an executive grant of clemency, a full pardon, for former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, of Oklahoma, press secretary Sarah Sanders said.

Behenna was convicted of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone after killing a suspected al-Qaida terrorist in Iraq. He was paroled in 2014 and had been scheduled to remain on parole until 2024.

A military court had sentenced Behenna to 25 years in prison. However, the Army's highest appellate court noted concern about how the trial court had handled Behenna's claim of self-defense, Sanders said. The Army Clemency and Parole Board also reduced his sentence to 15 years and paroled him as soon as he was eligible.

Behenna's case attracted broad support from the military, Oklahoma elected officials and the public, Sanders said. She added that Behenna was a model prisoner while serving his sentence, and ""in light of these facts, Mr. Behenna is entirely deserving"" of the pardon.

Behenna acknowledged during his trial that instead of taking the prisoner home as he was ordered, he took the man to a railroad culvert, stripped him, and then questioned him at gunpoint about a roadside bombing that had killed two members of Behenna's platoon.

Behenna, a native of the Oklahoma City suburb of Edmond, said the man moved toward him and he shot him because Behenna thought he would try to take his gun.

Oklahoma's attorney general first requested a pardon for Behenna in February 2018 and renewed his request last month. Attorney General Mike Hunter said he believed Behenna's conviction was unjustified because of erroneous jury instructions and the failure of prosecutors to turn over evidence supporting a self-defense claim.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/u-s-and-world-news/trump-pardons-former-us-soldier-who-killed-iraqi-prisoner,2019-05-07T01:42:05Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

(Photo: Dorothy Edwards/Naples Daily New)

Jurors convicted an East Naples man accused of driving under the influence and killing a woman in a 2014 crash after deliberating for a little over an hour on Monday.

Kiereek Seymour, 29, of East Naples, was charged with DUI manslaughter after an early morning crash at Lakewood and Davis boulevards in East Naples on May 19, 2014.

Sandra Marie Maddux, 54, of East Naples, died from injuries suffered in the crash.

Jurors began deliberations around 4:30 p.m. Monday and returned with the guilty verdict at 5:45 p.m.

The two-week trial began April 22 and was the second related to the DUI manslaughter charge brought against Seymour.

The first trial ended in February when Collier Circuit Judge Joseph Foster declared a mistrial after a juror came out of the jury room during deliberations and indicated she was feeling uncomfortable.

Seymour is set to be sentenced in front of Foster on June 26 at 3:30 p.m.

Both trials included conflicting assertions about whether Seymour was driving the vehicle he was found in, who was at fault in the crash and whether Seymour's blood-alcohol content was above 0.08, the legal limit for driving.

Assistant State Attorney Mara Marzano began her closing argument on Monday by telling the jurors that Maddux lost her life because Seymour was driving impaired due to the alcohol and alprazolam he had in his system at the time of the crash.

While Defense Attorney Peter Adrien said the state had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Seymour was driving the vehicle, was actually impaired or was at fault in the crash that killed Maddux.

Witness testimony proved Seymour was driving the vehicle involved in the crash with Maddux, Marzano said.

""There was never anyone else there,” Marzano said. “There was never any possibility that anyone else got out of that car and ran away.”

Seymour was found by witnesses positioned on the passenger side of the vehicle after the crash and it’s not the defense’s burden to prove who, if it wasn’t Seymour, was driving the vehicle, Adrien said.

Evidence collected by officers from the Florida Highway Patrol showed that Seymour was speeding and driving at least 62 mph at the time of the crash, while Maddux was driving 18 mph, Marzano said.

Adrien told the jurors the investigation by Florida Highway Patrol officers was not done properly and the speeds of the vehicles involved in the crash changed in various versions of the crash report.

Witness testimony also showed that Seymour had a yellow traffic signal and Maddux a red traffic signal, Adrien said.

In addition, Adrien said Maddux’s car had no lights on after the crash. Maddux could have been driving the dark vehicle at night with no lights, which could have contributed to the crash, he said.

However, Seymour’s slurred speech and medical records from the hospital after the crash prove he was impaired, Marzano told the jurors.

“Nowhere here does it say we have to prove he was falling down drunk,” Marzano said.

Seymour admitted to an emergency responder that he had a consumed one and a half beers before the crash and hospital staff recorded Seymour as clinically intoxicated and high, Marzano said.

The additive effect of alprazolam and alcohol impaired Seymour, Marzano said.

“I told you this was a complicated matter,” Marzano said. “I would suggest to you when you pare it down to what is real and not real you will find the defendant guilty.""

Adrien said none of the testing or evidence presented by the state proved that Seymour was over the 0.08 blood-alcohol level limit.

""The defendant is not guilty and this was a horrible accident,” Adrien said. “How could he be? He was following all the traffic rules.”

Even before February’s mistrial, Seymour had been in court before to face charges related to the crash that killed Maddux.

The state attorney's office refiled the DUI manslaughter charge in 2016 after then-Collier Circuit Judge Fred Hardt vacated an earlier plea agreement.

The negotiated plea agreement related to charges stemming from a Marco Island crash and charges from the crash involving Maddux. Hardt wrote that he had to vacate all sentences in the two cases.

At a hearing in June 2016, Seymour’s attorneys argued that the officer’s sirens were not activated during the pursuit of Seymour in the Marco Island incident, court documents show.

In an August 2016 order to vacate the sentence, Hardt agreed with Seymour’s attorneys, writing that “the officer’s dash cam clearly demonstrates that his siren was not activated.”

Seymour was back at the Collier County Courthouse in April 2018 for a jury trial to face charges in the Marco Island incident.

After deliberating for four hours and returning for four more hours on a second day, six jurors found Seymour guilty on all charges related to the Marco Island incident on April 27, 2018.

However, in May 2018, Seymour was granted a new trial in that case after testimony revealed jurors found a law book left behind in the jury room and used it to deliberate.

The book had been left behind by a bailiff who was studying for the sergeant’s exam, the bailiff testified during the hearing in which Seymour was granted a new trial.

A new jury trial in the case related to the Marco Island incident is set to begin July 1 at 9 a.m. at the Collier County Courthouse.

993,Cape Coral police say brother of man's girlfriend beat him severely after confrontation,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Lee County on news-press.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

A man who told police he stomped on a Cape Coral man's head with the bottom of his foot rather than the heel because he ""didn't want to kill him"" is facing aggravated assault charges.

A confrontation between the two over access to a home resulted in the man being severely beaten.

Cape Coral police went to a home in the 1200 block of SE 21st Street shortly after 6 a.m. Saturday on a report of a disturbance and an unconscious man.

Officers said when they arrived the victim was standing in front of the residence with a large amount of blood on his face, body, and arms. His left eye was swollen nearly closed, police said.

A police report said that the victim’s live-in girlfriend has had her brother, Michael Lee Capobianco, 40, Cape Coral, stay with them after he was kicked out of a Southeast 21st home of their parents.

Because the parents were out of town she was having her boyfriend go to their house to feed the dog.

After the boyfriend entered the home, he found Capobianco already inside and confronted him at the front door, telling Capobianco that he is not allowed at the residence and had to leave.

Capobianco attacked his sister's boyfriend, punching him numerous times in the head and body. Police said he then placed the boyfriend in a choke hold causing the victim to lose consciousness. He then kicked him in the face and head several times.

Copabianco told police ""I didn't want to kill him so I used the bottom of my foot and not my heal,"" and ""I didn't use lethal force, so that's good, right?""

Police did not release the victim's name.

994,Deputies: Man claims demons made him batter pregnant woman in Hudson,"HUDSON, Fla. (WFLA) - A Pasco County man who was arrested for battering a pregnant woman claims demons took over his body and made him do it, deputies say.

Pasco deputies arrested 26-year-old Matthew Douglas Saturday night at his home in Hudson.

Deputies were called to the home around 10:30 to investigate a domestic battery call. When they got to the scene, deputies say Douglas refused to cooperate and wouldn't state his name.

Douglas was detained and put in the back of a patrol car. He later provided his name and admitted he didn't want to cooperate originally because he knew there was a warrant out for his arrest, deputies say.

According to the arrest report, Douglas told deputies demons took over his body and made him black out. He said that may have led him to become physical with his the pregnant woman, deputies noted in the report.

The victim, who is 18 weeks pregnant, told deputies she was playing Xbox Saturday night when Douglas told her to go to sleep. Douglas turned the game system off, but the victim turned it back on.

That's when the victim says Douglas grabbed her around the neck and started to choke her, the arrest report says. The victim told deputies she couldn't breathe and was scared. Deputies noted in the arrest report that the victim had a small area of bruising on her neck and three long scratch marks.

995,Court throws out restraining order against Cantonment man whose daily walks irked neighbor,"A Cantonment man accused of “stalking” his neighbor was actually just doing everyday activities like walking his dog, throwing away trash and trying not to get hit by traffic, according to a recent Florida appellate court decision.

On Thursday, the Florida First District Court of Appeal reversed an injunction against Billy Stone requiring him to stay at least 500 feet away from the residence of his neighbor, Teresa McMillian.

McMillian requested the injunction after telling the court she had received a threatening letter from Stone and had seen him walk past her property more than 10 times a day on multiple days.

But in a 2017 circuit court hearing, Stone’s attorney added some critical context for the court to consider.

More: Trains blocking roads in Cantonment have one commissioner demanding action

Stone had been taking routine walks around the circular street he and McMillian lived on since 2009, witnesses said. During one of Stone’s walks in December 2016, McMillian honked her horn and intentionally drove her car at Stone and his dog, prompting them to jump out of the way.

Stone admitted the incident made him angry, so he put a threatening letter in her mailbox warning her not to “pull another stunt like she did today.”

After receiving the letter, McMillian said she felt intimidated by Stone walking his dog in a vacant property adjacent to her home, so she installed motion-activated sprinklers at the property line. When a soaking didn’t deter Stone, she called law enforcement on him for trespassing.

McMillian’s petition for a stalking injunction was denied by the trial court in July 2017, which noted the neighbors were engaged in “tit for tat” behavior and encouraging them to “go (their) separate ways.

More: Pensacola attorney suspended for one year for 'failing to diligently represent client'

Still, McMillian filed another petition for injunction two months later, this time arguing she had began reviewing her security cameras daily and logging how many times Stone walked past her house. She also complained of seeing Stone place dog waste in her roadside garbage can on one occasion, and on another step onto her driveway “to avoid being hit by a bus” despite being previously told to stay away from her property.

Stone testified he walks to alleviate anxiety, to visit with neighbors, and to help with the neighborhood watch program he helped develop. Six neighbors testified that Stone is active in the community and routinely walks past their house every day, often stopping to talk. Stone testified that he always picks up after his dog and, if it is trash day, will put it in the nearest can before it gets picked up; he admitted using McMillian’s can once, but denied it was an attempt to intimidate her.

Nonetheless the trial court granted McMillian a one-year injunction requiring Stone to stay clear of McMillian, her property and her vehicle.

Stone appealed the injunction, and the court agreed, finding McMillian took every innocuous act of Stone as one of aggression and intimidation, even though there was no evidence any of it was malicious.

“We do not disagree with Stone’s argument that he walks around his neighborhood, put dog waste in a trash can, and avoided getting hit by a bus for legitimate purposes under (Florida statute),” the court wrote.

Stone’s attorney, Robert Powell of Clark Partington, said his client “feels exonerated that justice was properly meted out” and relieved that the stain on his neighborhood reputation had been removed.

McMillian did not fight the appeal and has no listed attorney, however she has 15 days from the date of the opinion to contest the appellate court findings.

1007,"Student killed in shooting at Colorado school identified, 3 students remain in hospital","Advertisement Student killed in shooting at Colorado school identified, 3 students remain in hospital Share Shares Copy Link Copy

The 18-year-old suspect in Tuesday’s shooting at STEM School Highlands Ranch is expected to make his first court appearance Wednesday afternoon, and the student killed days before his senior year was set to end was identified by his parents.Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock, 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler and Gov. Jared Polis hosted the news conference early Wednesday, flanked by their school and law enforcement partners, and told the northeast Colorado community reeling from another mass shooting to come together for the victims.“This does not define us. It won’t today and it won’t tomorrow,” Brauchler said, calling the latest shooting an “aberrant” act and urging the community to mourn, to support one another, and to continue to send their children to school.“Our hearts are hurting for them,” Polis said of the school community, adding that he felt “frankly sick” about the latest Colorado shooting.The authorities said that the adult suspect in the shooting, 18-year-old Devon Erickson, will likely make his first court appearance at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday.Erickson is expected to be booked on 30 counts after his first court appearance, according to Colorado court records. Those include one count of first-degree murder after deliberation and 29 counts of attempted first-degree murder.He will not face formal charges until later this week or next week should prosecutors bring them.On Wednesday morning, the parents of the 18-year-old who was killed in the shooting was identified by his parents in an interview with ABC News.Kendrick Castillo, 18, is the student killed in Tuesday's shooting, his parents said. John Castillo said his son was on the school's robotics team and shared photos of Kendrick attending prom with his friends in recent weeks. Castillo was one of nine people who were shot at the school.“I want people to know about him,” John Castillo said through tears.Spurlock said early Wednesday that he expected the county coroner to formally identify the victim killed in the shooting.Spurlock said Wednesday morning that of the eight students who were shot and injured, three remained hospitalized. All three were in intensive care at area hospitals, Spurlock said, but the other six victims had been released. Authorities said Tuesday all of the victims were age 15 or over.Spurlock adjusted what he said Tuesday and said the juvenile suspect in the shooting, whose name and age has not been released, was a female. He originally said the suspect was male on Tuesday, but said Wednesday that officials originally thought the suspect was male by their “appearance.”Sources told Denver7 late Tuesday that the juvenile suspect is in the process of transitioning from female to male.Brauchler said he was unsure if the juvenile would face their first advisement Wednesday and said it was too early to say whether his office would pursue adult charges.He also urged people to focus on the victims of the shooting rather than the alleged shooters and to remember that the suspects are presumed innocent until proven otherwise.Spurlock said that there were “very heroic things that took place” at the school Tuesday and said at least one student encountered the suspects and worked to stop them. He said he had also reviewed video from inside the school showing other heroic acts involving Douglas County deputies and staffers and students at the school.He described the incident between the student and the alleged shooters as an “encounter” but said he could not elaborate further.Spurlock said that there were no shots exchanged between officers who responded to the shooting and the alleged shooters and said both suspects were taken into custody. He said he believed one of the suspects had already been restrained by the school’s armed private security officer when deputies got to them. He said the two suspects were not taken into custody at the same location inside the school. The school does not have school resource officers but does employ private, armed security.Spurlock confirmed that at least two handguns were used in the shooting. High-ranking sources told Denver7 Tuesday night that three handguns and a rifle were recovered but said the rifle was not used in the shooting.Spurlock said officials were working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine how the suspects were able to obtain the guns. He said he could not comment on whether the suspects were talking with law enforcement.Sources told Denver7 Tuesday that the motive of the alleged shooters went beyond bullying and involved revenge and anger toward others at the school and that at least one of the suspects was involved in legal and illegal drug use and had been in therapy. But Spurlock said Wednesday the incident was “too new” to establish a motive. Tuesday's shooting is the first since Columbine in which two shooters were involved.Spurlock said he could not discuss a possible motive at Wednesday’s news conference but said authorities were “deep” in social media searches and analysis of the suspects’ phones and computers. They are also continuing to interview witnesses, which Spurlock said would still take some time because around 600 of the 1,800 students at the K-12 school were directly affected by the shooting.Spurlock confirmed that a car seen taken from the home of Erickson on Tuesday night, which had graffiti spray-painted onto it that read, “F--- society,” was being analyzed as evidence but said he had no specific information on the graffiti.Police were called to the school in Highlands Ranch just before 2 p.m. Tuesday . Spurlock said that deputies were at the school two minutes after the initial call, and praised the work of first responders to the scene.STEM School Highlands Ranch will be closed for at least the rest of the week, the district said Tuesday night. Other Douglas County schools are open Wednesday but have extra security on-site. There are grief counselors available for the STEM community at the school, and there will be a crisis support center available to all STEM School students and families at the St. Andrew United Methodist Church in Highlands Ranch starting at 8 a.m.The district is asking for new or gently used blankets to be donated for STEM students, staff and families to give out at the crisis support center. Anyone who wishes to donate can drop the blankets off at the school district's building, located at 620 Wilcox Street in Castle Rock, between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. Wednesday.Friday was set to be the last day of school for the STEM seniors, which included Castillo, who had his life taken Tuesday, as well as the 18-year-old man accused of forever disrupting the lives of so many others.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/colorado-school-shooting/27396854,2019-05-08T17:08:00Z,WPBF-TV,Florida Man,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

St. Petersburg, FLA - It's very likely you've never heard of ""toe tagging,"" but it's a potentially deadly game played out on the streets of St. Petersburg.

it almost cost a young man his life.

The young victim is going to have to learn how to walk again. The crash shattered his hip. His fiance blames a stupid game called ""toe tagging.""

Early Sunday morning at MLK and Jasmine Way in St. Petersburg, TWO cars hit head-on.

The impact crushed Leonard ""L.A.” Hills’ Camry and sent him to the emergency room at Bayfront Health.

“He's not doing too good. He's in a lot of pain. His hip, he can't really move the left side of his bottom too much without having guidance,” said his fiancé, T'angela Carbart.

She said this crash is the result of ""toe tagging.""

“They have a line full of cars where they go down the streets and they race through red lights. They'll try to swerve between traffic. It all depends on who can beat who,” she explained.

It's a big game of what used to be called ""chicken.""

“Who is the fasted car that can get in the front of the line. And who can dodge cars in and out of traffic,” said Carbart.

St. Petersburg police cited the other driver, a 17-year-old, for being on the wrong side of the road.

“Was two cars. They were racing. That's what he said. He believed the other car was going about 100 mph. 'Cause he was going about 40,” said Carbart.

At the crash scene, bits of glass, crime scene tape and scuffed pavement mark the spot where the cars collided.

While St. Petersburg police aren't pointing their fingers at toe tagging, Carbart is convinced, and she has a message to young people who participate.

“Toe tagging is not a good thing. It is not fun. It's not exciting. It doesn't give you a thrill. It can kill you. It can harm you and other people,” she said.

L.A. Hills has a long rehab ahead, plus a wedding and being a dad to his 2-year-old daughter.

A St. Petersburg police spokeswoman said the definition of ""toe tagging"" seems to depend on who you ask.

1010,Thompson sentenced to life for murder and robbery of Allen Johnson in 2014,"Thompson sentenced to life for murder and robbery of Allen Johnson in 2014 Video

PANAMA CITY, Fla. -- Derrick Ray Thompson, convicted of first-degree felony murder and robbery with a firearm on Friday and now sentenced to life in prison.

""Feel like we've been kicked in the stomach a little bit,"" said Kim Limmer, niece/ sister of Allen Johnson.

Allen Johnson's family sat in the courtroom as Thompson was given two life sentences for the murder and robbery of Johnson in 2014.

""We thought for sure it was going to be more towards the death penalty,"" said Johnson's sister Vicki Wood.

Limmer addressed the court and Thompson after the sentence was announced by the clerk.

""I have to live with what you have done for the rest of my life,"" said Limmer when asked if she had anything to say to Thompson.

Limmer's husband, Mark, said, ""without as much as an apology.""

Thompson was previously sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a couple in Milton, Florida and Wood says Thompson acted the same in both cases.

Wood said, ""He never stood up. Not even at Milton or stood up here to address the families, to say anything in reference to say anything to killing the friends of his.""

The state was seeking the death penalty in this case. Under state constitutional changes, the decision had to be unanimous to give that sentence.

The family says they even though they didn't get the decision they wanted, they're appreciative of the state for their hard work. They say, no matter what, they will continue to honor Allen Johnson.

Limmer says the way Johnson was killed is a tragedy but she wants him to be remembered as a kind, sweet and caring man who loved everyone.

Over the two cases, Thompson will serve four life sentences consecutively in the Florida Department of Corrections.",https://www.mypanhandle.com/don-t-miss/thompson-sentenced-to-life-for-murder-and-robbery-of-allen-johnson-in-2014/1987247207,2019-05-07T23:18:49Z,MYPANHANDLE,Florida Man,"613 Harrison Ave, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
1011,Carjacking victim says tougher procedures needed after attacker's mistaken release,"When Amy Rowe was carjacked in the driveway of her Apopka home in 2017 by Cedric Gant and his fully-loaded AK-47, she had never been more terrified. Until Gant was mistakenly released from jail in April.

For three days, over Easter weekend, Gant was a free man.

A Brevard County judge sentenced Gant to time served for a misdemeanor warrant and released him.

The judge didn't know Gant had a federal hold on his record.

""They never contacted me, so I found out about this the Saturday after he released, because the other victim came to me,"" Rowe said. ""I couldn't sleep. I was scared, I know my kids were scared. I was more anxious than I was this past year and a half because I didn't know if he was going to come after me.""

Gant had been convicted in federal court of Rowe's carjacking and another armed carjacking and was headed to federal prison to serve a 23-year sentence.

But the paperwork that the Brevard County judge saw did not show a hold.

Brevard County Sheriff's Office spokesman Tod Goodyear said the Brevard County judge did not make a mistake.

""He [the judge] only handled the Brevard case that he [Gant] appeared on,"" Goodyear said. ""The judge would have nothing to do with the Federal case. He is not at fault.""

Goodyear said the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail, is conducting a review.

The mistake was made by an employee at the Lake County Jail.

Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman John Herrell said the employee ""misread"" Gant's hold information and was suspended for one day without pay for the mistake.

The Lake County Jail employee received an email from a corrections release specialist at the Orange County Jail advising that Gant ""has satisfied local charges and does not need to be returned to our agency"" and to ""release our holds only.""

The specialist instructed Lake County that Gant ""still does have holds for Lake County [carjacking] case #17CF002594.""

Still, the Lake County Jail employee signed a hold order stating Gant was wanted by no other agencies.

""They could've emailed someone, they could have called someone, they could've called the marshal's office,"" Rowe said. ""It only took another two minutes for somebody to say, listen, there are holds on this guy let me make sure I'm taking the right holds off. Because we double, triple check at my job. I don't understand why one person would be in charge of removing holds.""



Rowe said there was no need for Gant to be transferred to Brevard County to answer for a misdemeanor warrant after he had been sentenced to federal prison for 23 years.

""There was an unneeded transition,"" Rowe said. ""If he didn't need to go to Lake County or Brevard maybe this wouldn't have happened. That's one thing I don't understand. Why he needed to get rid of those charges to start his sentence.""

Rowe said she's considering hiring a victims' rights attorney because she believes her rights as a victim were violated.

""I get it, I understand that it's a mistake, we all make mistakes and misread things,"" Rowe said. ""But the fact that I was never contacted to say this guy's getting out. The fact that no one's ever called me to say we are so sorry.""

Rowe wants jails to toughen their inmate transfer and release procedures.

""I want them to seriously look at what they're doing,"" Rowe said. ""This is holding a gun to somebody's face. Threatening their life. And taking their property. He was sentenced to 23 years at the beginning of February. At the end of February he was released because of a clerical error. That shouldn't have happened.""

Gant was convicted of a carjacking in Eustis, carjacking Rowe in Apopka, and then running into a home to try and hide from police as they were chasing him.

1012,Blue-green algae suffocating part of Sarasota County's Lemon Bay,"- Blue-green algae, moving in large clumps, is littering the offshore waterways of Sarasota County.

It's not the exact type of cyanobacteria algae that bloomed in Lake Okeechobee but this algae comes with its own bad side effects.

In Lake O, the blue-green sludge was caused by the microcystis cyanobacteria. At Indian Mound Park in Englewood, in the waters of Lemon Bay, it's a form of cyanobacteria called Lyngbya wollei.

Fisherman Terry Kennan says, regardless of the name difference, he is watching where he casts his line.

""I wouldn't let any kids or animals near that stuff. I don’t think it’s healthy to be around that particular bloom,"" he said.

Continue reading below

The Florida Department of Health agrees. Cyanobacteria causes cyanotoxins which can cause skin rashes, lesions, respiratory irritation, and if ingested, intestinal problems. it can even kill animals that drink contaminated water.

RELATED: Florida's toxic algae crisis: Toxins found in air concern researchers

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection said cyanobacteria like what's being seen at Indian Mound Park is common in Florida, but Kennan said he's never seen it this bad.

After a horrible bout of red tide and witnessing similar algae problems in Indiana, he's concerned.

""Man is not going to survive. We have to have clean water... We have to spend some of our tax dollars on resolving these blooms. It has to be done. The money has to spent,"" he said.

This is not what you want to see in the water. Signs have been posted in areas of Sarasota county warning about a form of blue green algae. The DEP says it’s NOT the type found in Lake Okeechobee @FOX13News #Sarasota pic.twitter.com/shyDwAdTgA — Kim Kuizon FOX 13 (@kkuizon) May 7, 2019

Further north, in Osprey, a small patch remains at Blackburn Point Park.

""It's really messy. It almost looks like sewage coming in. It’s ugly looking,"" said Don Nelson.

The algae form large, brownish floating mats. As it's exposed to air and sunlight, the algae decay and produces a rotten egg smell.

""Anytime there’s anything in the water with potential danger, you have to be very careful. Respiratory and otherwise,"" said Nelson.

As the warning signs continue to present themselves, the DEP said it will continue testing and warn people to stay away from the bloom.

""I'm worried about the well-being of the wildlife and what’s going on and what consequences that will have,"" said Annabelle Von Girsewald.

To respond as quickly and efficiently as possible, residents and visitors are encouraged to report algal blooms through the DEP's hotline at 1-855-305-3903 or through the online reporting system at https://floridadep.gov/dear/algal-bloom.

Residents and visitors are always advised to avoid coming into contact with algae and to stay out of the water where a visible bloom is present.",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/blue-green-algae-suffocating-part-of-sarasota-county-s-lemon-bay,2019-05-07T21:48:03Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Florida Man,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609
1013,Teen to be charged as adult in Flagler County murder,"- A 17-year-old will be charged as an adult for the murder of another teenager in Flagler County.

Marion Gavins Jr., of Palm Coast, has been indicted by a grand jury for first-degree murder and will be tried as an adult.

Flagler County deputies arrested Gavins in April for the murder of 18-year-old Curtis Israel Gray.

According to investigators, Gavins and Gray got into an altercation outside the Coin Laundry on Belle Terre near Palm Coast Parkway and at some point, deputies say he shot and killed Gray.

Witnesses at the scene were able to help authorities quickly identify a suspect.

“Our detectives worked swiftly and strategically to solve this murder investigation and were able to take Gavins Jr. into custody without anyone else getting hurt,” Sheriff Rick Staly said. ""This is a tragedy for two families, one who lost a son who was an aspiring athlete and the other whose son will likely spend the rest of his life in prison or face the death penalty. I hope this fast arrest will help the Gray family with their loss.""

Gavins is being held by the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office at the Duval County Jail in Jacksonville until he turns 18 years old on May16. Once Gavins turns 18, he will be transported back to the Sheriff Perry Hall Inmate Detention Facility in Flagler County, according to a press release.

“We fully support the state’s decision and applaud the Grand Jury and State Attorney Larizza,” Sheriff Staly said. “Sadly, this is a young man who exhibited increasingly violent behavior that ultimately caused another teenager’s death. Being tried as an adult is the most appropriate way to prosecute this crime.""

Gavins reportedly has a criminal arrest history dating back to 2014 that includes sale of marijuana, violation of probation, possession of a weapon on school campus, and domestic violence.

A Sunday bike ride through an Ormond Beach park was anything but pleasant for a woman and her boyfriend.He said he rode right into a fishing line, tied off between a dock and a tree, that was at neck height.The man said he had to fall off his bike to avoid a possible life-threatening injury.The couple alerted police, who took a report and suggested it might have been homeless people in the woods using fishing line to dry clothes, but the couple feels certain this was no accident.""I'm lucky to walk away. It's just scary to think that something like that is out here,"" the man said.The man and his girlfriend asked WESH 2 News not to show their faces since they ride bikes in Central Park almost daily, and fear reprisal for sounding the alarm. But the victim showed WESH 2 News his neck with an angry red mark along his throat where fishing line tied across a path near the Joyce Ebbets Pier caught him. He had to fall off his bike to save himself.""It was burning, like somebody was like, taking fishing wire or something like that trying to decapitate me the whole time,"" he said.""All of a sudden, he goes down to the ground and I see the line come up out of his neck,"" the man's girlfriend said.His girlfriend shared a picture on social media with an arrow showing where the fishing line was located -- fishing line with a hook attached. It had rained, so the pair weren't riding too fast. If they had been riding faster or if the test line had been thicker, she thinks the outcome could have been far more serious.""He could have gone right through it, and it could have taken his head off in all reality,"" she said.Both are sure the fishing line was placed along the path deliberately.It was intentional. There's no way that this could have been somebody's fishing line that got hung up on the dock and they just walked with it because it would have been laying on the ground. It was strung up at neck height on purpose.:Police did a search and didn't find any more possible booby traps.The couple just wants other people in the area to be aware.

1021,Bee crisis: Pollinators endure countless threats in Florida,"COCOA BEACH, Fla. — Tim Gould by now is well attuned to all the buzz beneath his roof.

""I don't know why they're picking on me,"" Gould says, as wildlife trapper Leo Cross climbs a ladder to vacuum out the beehive inside his roof. ""They've lit me up multiple times.""

No hard feelings: Gould wants to save his tormentors. He knows their importance as pollinators for a third of what we eat. He knows Cross won't kill them.

He knows they're in deep trouble. And if they don't make it, likely, neither will we.

Scientists call it a ""pollinator health crisis."" One in three mouthfuls of everything we eat directly or indirectly rely upon honeybee production, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Pollinators contribute more than $24 billion to the American economy, $15 billion from honey bees alone.

But domestic pollinators have plummeted for decades, especially native bees, recent research shows. Managed honey bees dropped from 6 million colonies in 1947 to 2.5 million now. A phenomenon called colony collapse disorder killed 23 percent of the honey bee population after the winter of 2006-2007. Meanwhile, monarch butterflies have dipped 84 percent.

Fewer pollinators pose a serious risk to domestic crops, ecological health and the economy in Florida and nationwide, scientists warn. Like canaries in a coal mine, bees also reflect the overall health of the environment. The rapid loss of bees over the past decade may signal a decline in the health of the planet, scientists warn, and a symptom of much larger environmental problems.

But Florida's bees, appear to be — for the moment — on the mend, beekeepers and state agricultural officials say. They continue to face a litany of threats from pests, pesticides and diseases, as well as hurricanes. But Florida has the advantage of yearly boosts from commercial beekeepers up north who bring their bees to winter here, providing a spillover effect for beekeepers like Clifton Best.

He sees first hand — without using gloves — a bee comeback in Brevard. It manifests in the daily calls he fields from fearful homeowners wanting to rid their property of unwanted bees without using pesticides to kill them.

""I'm doing so much bee removal, I don't have time to sit still,"" Best says from his 2-acre bee operation in Canaveral Groves.

Earlier this month, a Melbourne man was stung more than 100 times while trying to save his dog from a swarm of bees. He was hospitalized and recovered, but his dog died. Leo Cross, of Florida Wildlife Trappers, responded to the scene, vacuuming thousands of bees from inside the walls of the the Myrtlewood Road home.

Clifton Best's bee haven is nestled in a remote wooded area. Through a fenced-in narrow passageway, Best keeps 50 bee colonies in wooden boxes propped up on concrete blocks among towering trees. A constant roar of bees amplifies each time Best approaches the boxes.

Nationwide, bee colonies like his are not doing so well. A 2015 USDA national survey of beekeepers found mixed trends for bee colonies. But Florida's bee colonies grew from about 150,000 colonies in 2007 to almost 400,000 colonies in 2014. But those numbers can be misleading, scientists say, because beekeepers often split their colonies. So more colonies doesn't necessarily mean more bees. The surveys also don't take into account the health of the colonies.

Best credits the increase in bees he sees to state efforts to ease rules on allowing beekeepers to remove nuisance bees, mitigating others from excessive use of pesticides to rid homes of bees.

Other state actions could soon help as well. A bill is pending in the Florida Legislature to create a special ""Save the Bees"" license plate for the Florida State Beekeepers Association. A portion of the money would go toward raising awareness of the importance of beekeeping in Florida agriculture by funding honeybee research, education, outreach and husbandry.

State actions ""nascent and anemic""

But state laws and policies to protect bees and other pollinators are in their infancy, researchers who study pollinators say.

In a paper published this year in the journal Environmental Science and Policy, Missouri researchers called for global monitoring and conservation agreements. They found that since 2000, 36 states have passed 109 new laws addressing beekeeping, pesticides, habitat, awareness and research. Florida wasn't one of them.

They called state efforts, with few exceptions ""nascent and anemic steps in addressing a pollinator health crisis.""

A mere nine states — Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon and Vermont — have enacted legislation to protect pollinators from pesticides.

But the Missouri researchers pointed to some promising recent developments, including increased awareness and alarm about pollinator losses and the threats to food security and economic stability.

""They're beginning to see that not all insects are pests,"" said Damon Hall, an assistant professor at University of Missouri's School of Natural Resources and lead author on the study.

While market interest and investment will likely save the honey bees, which Europeans brought here, Hall says the much bigger worry is native bees, of which there are 4,500 species in North America. ""We don't know how important native bees are to our crops,"" Hall said.

In October, the National Conference of State Legislators brought attention to the issue in a report that also called on more state and federal protections for pollinators.

Several federal bills have been introduced in recent years to protect pollinators. The Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2015 directs the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to take actions related to pesticides, including suspending the registration of neonicotinoid pesticides, a class of nicotine-based insecticides. EPA prohibits use of certain neonicotinoid pesticides when bees are present.

""I think they need a more thorough review,"" Hall said.

Colony Collapse Disorder baffles

Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), which causes rapid and unexpected bee loss within a hive, continues to confuse scientists, who have proposed theories as to the cause, but nothing definitive. Scientists are studying multiple potential causes, with some suspecting it may not even be a new phenomenon. Inquiries have pointed to malnutrition, genetically modified crops, a mite that transmits viruses to bees, or some undiscovered pests or diseases.

In 2011, countless bees died for unknown reasons near Brevard's southern border, leading some to suspect it was a case of CCD.

State agricultural investigators determined the South Brevard bees were being killed via sabotage, according to University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension officials. The bee's food was spiked with a pesticide, though no charges were ever filed.

Bees can carry granular pesticides from residential landscapes back to hives, mistaking it for pollen, with deadly consequences.

So experts recommend getting a beekeeper to remove the bees.

County lightens up on bees, too

With emerging threats from Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses that thrives in Florda's extreme wet conditions, county mosquito control officials must weigh that risk with the potential harm pesticides pose to pollinators.

Brevard's pesticide applicators are licensed in public health by state agriculture, Joseph Faella, director of Brevard County Mosquito Control, said via email.

They follow product labels and account for wind, rain, time of day, habitats, and other site conditions to prevent any inadvertent environmental impacts, he added.

When chemical spraying is a must, the county sprays at least 30 minutes after sunset, when bees and other pollinators are generally inactive, he said.

Brevard's flooding from hurricanes and other storms resulted in an overall reduction in mosquito-control pesticide use over the past five years, Faella added.

The county captured floodwaters within 28,000 acres of lands surrounded with earthen dikes used to manage water levels in order to eliminate mosquito egg laying opportunities.

That's one method of reducing mosquito breeding, in what's called integrated pest management (IPM). The county also uses biological control and outreach education, first trying to get folks to eliminate water holding containers (and sometimes stock fish).

Horticulturists say maintaining diverse plant life in your backyard can help promote pollinators.

On Best's land, bees have their pick of a diverse array of plant and tree life. They swarm around Clifton Best as he stands in front of their hive box.

""It agitates them a little bit when we get in front of their entrance,"" Best says as he holds a metal can of smoking pine needles in front of the hive.

The smoke blocks the pheromones that signal them to sting an invader.

He cracks the lid open with a metal wedge. The static-like buzzing roar heightens in volume.

Best provides them with hive racks. The rest is up to them, as long as we stay out of the way.

1027,Skirmish at North Fort Myers community over veteran's Vietnam War memorial mural settled ... unhappily,"A skirmish between residents and management at a North Fort Myers development involving a memorial to the Vietnam War ended peacefully if not unhappily Tuesday.

The issue arose seemingly overnight when residents of the Del Tura Golf & Country Club began talking on social media sites about a mural on a garage door painted in black and depicting a Vietnam War-era soldier kneeling before a cross with a helicopter flying in the background.

Community officials sent Bob Masson, 71, a Vietnam War vet and the mural's owner, a letter asking him to remove the depiction. Apparently there also had been a complaint.

""It feels like I've been kicked in the head,"" Masson said. ""It feels like (his service in the war) meant nothing right now. It meant a lot to us when we were over there.""

Tuesday morning a group of residents gathered at the Del Tura clubhouse parking lot and started discussing the issue, which they said they thought was all about the military content of the mural.

Del Tura is a 55-and-over manufactured homes community on U.S. 41 in North Fort Myers.

""There's a lot of military veterans in here,"" Don Beavers, 60 and a veteran, said. ""It was on NextDoor and it just blew up yesterday. Everyone got involved last night.""

NextDoor is a social media site that developments such as Del Tura, gated communities and local communities can join to find out goings-on for their specific areas.

Richard Dzedzej, a resident at Del Tura, said the homeowner is a Vietnam veteran and was going to comply with the letter he received and paint over the picture.

""Other veterans told him that there is nothing wrong with it and to leave it intact,"" Dzedzej said.

Eventually Fred Taylor, the community manager, came out and addressed the residents.

""I'm happy to answer questions,"" Taylor told them. ""But not with the news present.""

Taylor told the group before moving inside the clubhouse that he was unaware they would be coming to meet with him with the news media present.

When questioned about the letter Taylor said Masson had not sought the proper approval despite community rules that disallow any mural on a garage door.

""I explained it is not the content of the graphic,"" Taylor said before asking the residents to meet with him in private. ""It is any graphic.""

Taylor pointed out that the community flies a POW flag on its main flagpole.

After the meeting the residents said they were satisfied but some were still a bit rankled that it was handled the way it was.

""I consider it unhappily settled,"" Dzedzej said. ""I understand the point but do think they could have let him keep it.""

Dzedzej's son Mike doesn't live at Del Tura but was visiting with his veteran dad and wasn't happy either.

""I think it's nonsense that he has to take it down,"" he said.

Masson, who has a flagpole with the POW and U.S. flags flying, and statues of military figures on his front lawn in basically the same configuration as the mural, said he put up the mural three months ago.

""I'm a military man all the way,"" Masson said. ""I'm just appalled that I have to take this off. It took them three months to send me the letter. But I see their point, they have a job to do.""

He said he was told he could keep the mural until Memorial Day and then replace it with a flag of the same topic or a plexiglass depiction and place it alongside the house. He said the brief battle won't prompt him to move.

""I have a lot of good friends, veterans, behind me 100 percent. I'm very disappointed,"" he said. ""But I'll get over it. ... I'll bite the bullet.""

1035,"After regular Baker Act committals, treatment program helps Naples teen","Caleb Caldwell’s delicate peace with himself wavered earlier this year when a violent outburst nearly led to a mental health evaluation under Florida’s Baker Act — yet again.

The 19-year-old from Naples had skipped some of the medications he takes to treat symptoms of his bipolar disorder and got into an argument with his mother and brother.

“He was being very violent. And he did put his hands on me,” said his mother, Mellisa Caldwell. “He just gets really out of hand. He does. And he’s a big guy.”

But given the troubles of Caleb’s life, the fact this lapse was not worse is something of a victory.

Caleb, an otherwise soft-spoken young man who finally landed a paying job and hopes to work in sports medicine, spent most of his early and mid-adolescence in and out of mental health crisis units.

It was before his condition had been fully diagnosed, and his prescribed medication was wanting.

He was bullied. He had violent outbursts at home and at school. He regularly threatened suicide. And at one point, he was getting committed under the Baker Act nearly every other week.

The boy’s troubling behavior, his later mood swings and propensity to violence — seemingly without remorse — even prompted one psychiatrist to tell the Naples family that the boy had “sociopathic criminal potential.”

So much happened, and so much of it seems like a blur to Caleb.

“A lot of this has been going on for so long that I don’t remember a lot,” Caleb said.

Then, when he was 16, after one of his threats to kill himself and another Baker Act evaluation at the David Lawrence Center in East Naples, real progress: a new diagnosis and treatment plan that seemed to better address his behavior problems.

It turns out that Caleb, now 19, was on the autism spectrum, something multiple mental health professionals he encountered failed to notice, according to his family. He got different medications and found a mental health counselor who is helping him control his impulses.

He soon got an internship with the NCH Baker Downtown Hospital as part of the Project SEARCH program, which helps find jobs for teens and young adults with developmental disabilities.

Before his last behavioral lapse — the first serious one in years — Caleb said he hoped those days were behind him.

“There are times when I have some issues, but it doesn’t get to that point anymore,” he said.

But the family knows there will never be a treatment silver bullet. Caleb's problems will never just go away.

They consider themselves lucky because of the help from the David Lawrence Center and that they have the means to aggressively work to find him treatment. But they worry about Caleb's future.

He is transitioning into the working world. He still lives with his parents, but if he is committed under the Baker Act again, now as an adult, law enforcement officers would not be required to contact them.

Mellisa Caldwell is trying to establish legal guardianship of him into adulthood. Caleb isn't quite sure what he thinks about that.

“I feel like there are times that I need it,"" he said. ""But I think there are times when I need my own space and think I’m fine on my own. But I do think there are times — like when I get Baker Acted – what would I have done if she wasn’t there?""

1039,Suspect arrested in New York in connection with Miami Beach homicide,"Nicholas Brent Gibson, 32, was arrested May 5 in New York City in connection with the killing of Erik B. Stocker, 77, in Miami Beach.

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - A suspect has been arrested in New York days after a 77-year-old man was found dead inside his apartment in Miami Beach, authorities confirmed Monday.

According to Miami Beach police spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez, Erik B. Stocker was killed at least 10 days before his body was found last Tuesday inside his unit at the Tribeca apartments at 1508 Michigan Ave.

Rodriguez said the suspect was quickly identified as Nicholas Brent Gibson, 32, who was also wanted by the U.S. Marshals Service for a probation violation for failing to register as a sex offender.

Miami Beach police detectives learned that Gibson had traveled to New York City and alerted the New York Police Department and the U.S. Marshals Service, Rodriguez said.

He said some Miami Beach detectives also traveled to New York Friday to search for Gibson.

Gibson was taken into custody Sunday in Manhattan by NYPD transit police officers.

Rodriguez said there was a struggle during his arrest and at least one officer was injured.

Gibson will eventually be extradited to Miami to face charges in the killing of Stocker.

Rodriguez said he may also face charges in New York City for assaulting police officers during his arrest and for resisting arrest.

""The MBPD is extremely grateful for the support and assistance provided to us by the U.S. Marshals' Miami and New York offices and the NYPD's Intelligence Bureau, Transit Bureau and Detective Bureau,"" Rodriguez said in an email. ""We are particularly thankful for the effort made by the transit police officers who struggled with this dangerous suspect and took him into custody.""

Detectives have not said how Stocker was killed or released a motive for the killing.

1047,Actor Robert De Niro spotted at Central Florida restaurant,"- Staff at a Titusville restaurant say it was nerve-wracking when Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro walked through the door and took a seat at a table.

Server Ashley Hughes was working at Pier 220 when he came in. “When we got the phone call saying he's coming, we were like really? Really?” Hughes said.

They say the star of cinema classics like The Godfather and Casino was at the restaurant with his son and another man. “Visiting the Space Center, he took his son, but could be other things too,” Hughes said.

Manager Danielle Van Wart said they wanted to make sure he had a good experience there. “We were standing around at the host station, walking around, making sure everything was nice and clean and the food was gonna be great for him, but we also wanted to give him his space so we didn't bother him,” she said.

Van Wart said that afterwards, De Niro was happy to take a few photos with the staff. “We waited until the very end when he signed and got up, and asked could we get a picture? He was very cool, like yeah, go ahead!”

Restaurant staff said De Niro was there for more than an hour and a half and he was a good tipper.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/entertainment/actor-robert-de-niro-spotted-at-central-florida-restaurant,2019-04-24T23:51:38Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
1049,"Central Florida Easter bunny brawler seen in viral video is fugitive with violent past, police say","Antoine McDonald has gained national notoriety for fighting in an Easter Bunny costume in Orlando. He's also wanted in New Jersey and has a history of armed robbery.

A bar hopping bunny who claimed he was defending a woman when cameras caught him in a downtown Orlando brawl Easter Sunday may not be so innocent.

Turns out, the man in the suit — 20-year-old Antoine McDonald — is wanted in New Jersey in connection with a vehicle burglary last fall. He was also recently a “person of interest” in a carjacking and two armed robberies in Pasco County, according to the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office.

McDonald could have relished in anonymity, his face and identity hidden by the pink nose and tall ears of the bunny costume. But after the video went viral, McDonald spoke to multiple media outlets, including TMZ and Orlando’s WKMG. He even created the Instagram profile, badbunnyof19.

He said he’s not a violent person.

A post shared by Underground Public House (@ugphorlando) on Apr 22, 2019 at 7:30am PDT

“I am the type of person to avoid fights by any means necessary, but in that situation, I would fight any day,” he told WKMG.

McDonald said he and a few friends were out for a Sunday Funday. It being Easter, they made the obvious choice to hit the bars while taking turns wearing a bunny costume. As they neared SAK Comedy Lab on South Orange Avenue, McDonald hopped to action.

“I saw him spit on her and then I saw, you know like a fight break out,” he told TMZ. “I just ran over there.”

McDonald said he ran over, not even thinking that he was still in the suit, with hopes of breaking up the fight. But when that led to the man getting on top of the woman, he started laying into the man with a few literal rabbit punches.

The fight was quickly broken up by Orlando Police, but no arrests were made.

Posts on the new Instagram page espouse messages of heroism and helping those in need. Criminal records from at least three states, however, tell a different story of the man beneath the ears.

According to police in Dover, Del., McDonald was arrested in early 2017 after he and two others were accused of committing two armed robberies in a span of 12 hours on New Year’s Day.

McDonald was charged with two counts of robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, second-degree conspiracy and tampering with physical evidence.

Police said he and his accomplices robbed three people by gunpoint, hitting one with the gun and punching another, then robbed two more people by gunpoint before fleeing in a red SUV police said McDonald owned.

In September 2018, police in South Brunswick, N.J., said McDonald and an accomplice were caught on surveillance cameras breaking into, and burglarizing, a car. The township’s police charged McDonald in the crime and issued a warrant for his arrest, but said they believed he fled the state. Police in New Jersey said McDonald burglarized two cars claiming the owners owed him money, but were unable to connect him to the owners.

South Brunswick Deputy Police Chief Jim Ryan said McDonald was also arrested in 2018 for harassing a man through social media and harassment for spitting at a 7-Eleven employee. He was also implicated in a basketball court assault that didn’t lead to an arrest.

“He’s got a lot of entries last year,” Ryan said.

A few months after the burglary warrant was issued, in January 2019, McDonald turned up in Pasco County jail after he was arrested on a charge of using a fake ID. According to deputies, McDonald used the ID to rent a U-Haul. At the time of the Pasco arrest, authorities were looking for McDonald in connection with a carjacking and two armed robberies, but he has yet to be charged.

Pasco jail records show him having a Zephyrhills address. He also told police in New Jersey he lived in Tampa and claims to have recently moved to Orlando.

One month later, in February, he was arrested on a charge of reckless driving by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office.

Two months after that arrest, he gained national attention for unleashing a flurry of furry fists to defend a stranger and, just a few months after fleeing to the state, reached peak Florida.

1053,Sex cult leader on trial says he just wanted to create a 'secret society of women',"Advertisement Sex cult leader on trial says he just wanted to create a 'secret society of women' Share Shares Copy Link Copy

The members of the upstate New York group called Nxivm looked up to Keith Raniere as a leader who spread his ideas on how to achieve success and happiness, but prosecutors say, he was actually a conman who took advantage of vulnerable people.""He targeted people who were looking to improve their lives,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Tanya Hajjar in her opening statement Tuesday at Raniere's trial in New York City. ""Once he gained their trust he took advantage of them. The defendant said that he was a mentor, but he was a predator.""Raniere, 58, has been charged with racketeering, sex trafficking, sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking, among other offenses. He has been held in federal custody in Brooklyn since his arrest in Mexico in March 2018. On Tuesday, he appeared in court wearing a gray sweater with a button down shirt, seated next to his attorney Marc Agnifilo.""I certainly agree with one thing,"" Agnifilo said in his own opening statement, in response to claims raised by the prosecution. ""You are going to hear the truth.""Agnifilo argued that the prosecution's own witnesses will testify that they loved being part of Nxivm -- an organization that prosecutors have deemed a pyramid scheme but others call a cult.Nearly 17,000 people took the self-help classes that Nxivm offered, Agnifilo said, and he urged the 12 jurors to look at the facts of the case through Raniere's perspective.Raniere's five other co-defendants have pleaded guilty and might testify against their former mentor. Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, ""Smallville"" actress Allison Mack, Kathy Russell, Lauren Salzman and Nancy Salzman have pleaded guilty to crimes ranging from visa fraud to racketeering.One former Nxivm member, identified only as Sylvie to protect her identity, began testifying Tuesday afternoon about coercion she said she experienced while part of the organization.Raniere has pleaded not guilty to all charges. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.Recruits provided 'collateral' information, prosecutors sayNxivm, created by Raniere in 2003, exploited recruits ""both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants' benefit,"" said U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue.An affidavit prepared by an FBI agent that was filed in support of the arrest warrant said Nxivm was based in upstate New York and operated like a multilevel marketing scheme, pushing members to take classes that cost as much as $5,000.It encouraged members to take more classes to move up the ranks and to recruit other members to help create more revenue, which left some members in debt to Nxivm itself, the affidavit said.The members in Nxivm called themselves ""Nxians,"" and wore different colored sashes that signified their ranks, the affidavit said. They signed nondisclosure agreements and promised not to reveal certain things about Nxivm's teachings, the affidavit said.Within the group was a secret society called DOS that prosecutors say consisted of dozens of women who were ""masters"" or ""slaves."" The affidavit said DOS masters went after recruits who were ""experiencing difficulties"" in their lives.While recruiting them, the masters would insist the recruits provide information about themselves as ""collateral,"" to encourage the recruits to keep information about DOS a secret, the affidavit said.The collateral included sexually explicit photos, videos in which the member tells damaging stories about themselves and letters making damaging statements against friends or family, the affidavit said.DOS had a pyramid structure, with Raniere at the top as the highest master and the only male, the affidavit said.Women who served as ""slaves"" were expected to complete tasks for their masters, and could be punished if they failed, the affidavit said. The affidavit said some slaves were expected to have sex with Raniere and stick to extremely low-calorie diets to stay thin -- because Rainere liked thin women.In one of the most bizarre allegations, some DOS members were branded with a cauterizing pen on their pubic regions in ceremonies that were recorded and could take half an hour, the affidavit said.""Some DOS victims were told that the brand stood for the four elements (the lines represented air, earth, and water and the cauterizing pen represented sealing with fire),"" the affidavit said. ""Based on information obtained during the course of the investigation, however, it is clear that the brand in fact consisted of Rainere's initials.""The man at the topRaniere's mission was teaching others about how to achieve true happiness, said his lawyer, Agnifilo.""Part of what I feel I have to prove is that Keith Raniere is not a monster,"" Agnifilo said. ""He's a well-intentioned person who spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how to help people be happier.""Raniere denies Nxivm is a cult, Agnifilo said.""He's nervous that the case has created a lot of what he views as sort of prejudice against him and his ideas,"" Angifilo said. ""He firmly believes his ideas are sound ideas, are good ideas, are humanitarian ideas.""He thinks DOS is a good idea and is a pro-woman group. He created it to have women have their own society ... where men would play no role.""Before starting Nxivm, Raniere had founded a company called Executive Success Programs which was supposed to ""actualize human potential,"" said the affidavit.Is Nxivm really a cult?Prosecutors don't go as far as to call the group a cult in court filings.But cult expert and former cult member Janja Lalich -- who was not a member of Nxivm and is not a witness in the trial -- says it ""absolutely"" is a cult, which she defines as a group or social movement with a shared devotion to a charismatic, authoritarian leader that's structured in such a way that it asserts influence and control over its members to keep them under their control. She believes this is the biggest trial of a purported cult leader in nearly a decade.""The Nxivm courses were used as a way to draw people into the more restricted and more perverse inner circles, including DOS,"" Lalich said. ""In a sense, Nxivm is a front to draw people in to be able to target certain people and pull them in further and further.""Lalich said that most people who become involved with cults were recruited as members by family or friends. And once inside, it became difficult to leave.Actress Catherine Oxenberg, a former star on the TV show ""Dynasty,"" also thinks Nxivm is a cult. Oxenberg was able to get her daughter, India, out of the group. She had no comment on if India was asked to testify in the trial.Mother and daughter started taking Nxivm classes in 2011, thinking they would learn about entrepreneurship, Catherine Oxenberg said in an email to CNN. India became more engrossed in the classes and moved from Los Angeles to Nxivm's upstate New York headquarters, her mother said.""One of the most deeply evil tricks of cults, Nxivm/DOS in particular, is that they hide behind the veneer of choice, even choices many rightly say are virtuous,"" Catherine Oxenberg said. ""But in cults such 'choices' only serve the perverted goals of the leader.""Testifying could be 'empowering but devastating'Bronfman, Mack, Russell, Lauren Salzman and Nancy Salzman were accused of serious crimes of their own, including prosecutors' allegation that they ""were aware of and facilitated Raniere's sexual relationship with two underage victims,"" including a 15-year-old girl. Dozens of child pornography images are part of the evidence.Mack, 36, pleaded guilty in April to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges and faces up to 40 years in prison. She was a DOS master and helped co-found DOS, which was targeted toward actors, prosecutors said.Bronfman, who served on Nxivm's executive board for nearly a decade, used her wealth to help finance Nxivm's activities, prosecutors said. She tearfully pleaded guilty in April to concealing and harboring undocumented immigrants for financial gain and fraudulent use of identification. She faces up to 27 months in prison and agreed to pay $6 million in forfeiture to the government.Lalich said she has spoken with about a dozen former Nxivm members, and believes it will be difficult for Raniere's former followers to face him in court, especially those who have recently pleaded guilty.""It'll feel empowering but it'll also be devastating,"" Lalich said. ""I'm hoping that the attorneys have a good support system set up for all of those women.""Agnifilo told CNN he believes that if any of the women who have pleaded guilty testify against Raniere, it would only help his case, and that Raniere has repeatedly told his attorney that he hopes his co-defendants don't have to serve prison time.""I think they're going to be important witnesses for both sides,"" Agnifilo said. ""I think they're going to give an accurate, balanced perspective.""",https://www.wpbf.com/article/sex-cult-leader-on-trial-says-he-just-wanted-to-create-a-secret-society-of-women/27407763,2019-05-08T17:11:00Z,WPBF-TV,Florida Man,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
1056,Bradenton police forcibly remove NAACP leader from meeting,"Chief denied accusations that officers had Rodney Jones' home under surveillance

BRADENTON — Police forcibly removed Rodney Jones, president of the Manatee County chapter of the NAACP, from a Bradenton City Council meeting Wednesday morning. Jones refused to surrender the podium when he exceeded a time limit for public comments and struggled with officers who escorted him out. Officers said they would charge him with disorderly conduct.

Jones appeared before the council to complain that undercover officers in unmarked cars had his home under surveillance for several hours on the night of April 22.

“I feel like my life is in danger,” Jones told council members. He said such police activities are being conducted against “civil rights” leaders across the nation.

His 15-year-old daughter is living elsewhere because he does not want her to be in jeopardy, Jones said. Jones told the council that his complaints to the Police Department had fallen “on deaf ears.” Jones appealed to Mayor Wayne Poston, the city’s police commissioner, to look into his allegations. Poston told Jones that Police Chief Bevan had investigated his complaint and determined that it was not valid.

Bevan offered to talk with Jones outside the chambers but he refused.

Jones remained at the podium and continued talking when told he exceeded the three-minute limit on public comment.

“I’m not stopping,” Jones said. An officer came to the podium to tell him that he had to leave the podium. “Man, don’t touch me,” Jones said as officers grabbed his arms to lead him out.

Bevan and two officers forcibly escorted Jones from the council chamber.

“Poston, you’re going to get yours,” Jones said as he was taken into the hallway.

Officers said afterward that they took Jones into the police department, which is in the same complex as City Hall, to book him on a disorderly conduct charge.

Later in the meeting, Bevan assured council members that she investigates “any and all allegations of wrongdoing” by officers.

Jones ran for a Manatee County School Board seat in 2014, losing to Charlie Kennedy. The Manatee Education Association endorsed him.

When a candidate, he reported that his background included being a clinical manager at Manatee Glens, a mental health clinic now known as Centerstone; running youth delinquency programs in Hardee and DeSoto Counties; working at State College of Florida as a project manager for a short-term grant; and serving on the school district's Citizen's Budget Advisory Committee.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190508/bradenton-police-forcibly-remove-naacp-leader-from-council-meeting?rssfeed=true,2019-05-08T10:48:30Z,Sarasota Herald,Florida Man,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236
1060,Derrick Thompson given life without parole for murder of Allen Johnson,"PANAMA CITY — Derrick Thompson on Tuesday was sentenced to life without parole for the 2014 murder of Allen Johnson, avoiding the death penalty.

A jury reached the verdict after almost four hours of deliberation. Jurors had the choice of life without parole or the death penalty. Family members and friends of Johnson, who were in the court audience, cried when hearing Thompson would get life instead of death.

“I have never seen remorse from (Thompson),” Kim Limmer, a relative of Johnson, said after the verdict was read. “I can’t sleep at night. I have to go to a grave to talk to him. He gets to see his mother. She still gets to see him.”

Thompson was found guilty Friday of first-degree murder and robbery with a firearm for the killing of Johnson, a friend. Thompson shot Johnson twice to get money to fund an addiction to prescription pills.

Prosecutor Larry Basford hugged Limmer and talked to the family and friends after the verdict. Johnson’s loved ones thanked Basford for his efforts and Basford said law enforcement investigators did a good job with the case.

“We appreciate y’all being patient. It’s not the verdict we wanted but the jury worked very hard. It wasn’t easy,” Basford said. “Allen was a good man. He was a good man to everyone who knew him.”

During the defense’s opening statement, attorney Kimberly Jewell said jurors were being asked to make one of the biggest decisions they ever will make.

“Will you agree with me a man’s life is worth more than his worst moments?” Jewell said to the jury.

The defense emphasized Thompson’s religious beliefs and how he could use that to help other inmates.

Thompson previously was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder in Santa Rosa County for the separate murders of Milton residents Steven Zackowski, 60, and Debra Zackowski, 59, shortly before Johnson was killed. Thompson also was sentenced to life without parole in that case.

The trial for Johnson’s murder is the first death penalty case to go to trial in Bay County since the revamping of capital punishment in Florida. The 12-person jury needed to unanimously return a verdict in favor of the death penalty for the sentence to be imposed.

The trial lasted seven days, not including the weekend. Jury selection lasted three days from April 29 to May 1. Opening statements were made May 1 after the jury was picked, and the penalty phase began Monday.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190507/derrick-thompson-given-life-without-parole-for-murder-of-allen-johnson?rssfeed=true,2019-05-07T18:37:38Z,Panama City News Herald,Florida Man,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
1061,Former Cape Coral resident now leading the ATF. She's the first woman to head the agency,"The new acting deputy director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — the first woman to head the federal agency — has her heart in Southwest Florida despite leading an agency based in Washington, D.C.

Regina Lombardo, 56 and known to everyone as ""Reggie"", looks fondly on her days in Fort Myers and Cape Coral when she worked in her parent's deli, was competitive in high school sports and modeled hairstyles for a top local stylist.

""It's been a ride,"" she said Tuesday, adding that the first female acting director aspect ""feels really profound.""

Lombardo said being the first female was never at the forefront of why she was at ATF.

Regina ""Reggie"" Lombardo, a former student in Cape Coral, is the first woman to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. (Photo: U.S. Department of Justice)

""It's an agency that regulates gun laws,"" she said, and not really a place a lot of women generally think of or naturally gravitate to.

""I hope to change that,"" she said. ""I feel humble and proud. I hope to be a role model. You can't be what you can't see.""

The ATF protects communities from violent criminals, criminal organizations, the illegal use and trafficking of firearms, the illegal use and storage of explosives, acts of arson and bombings, acts of terrorism, and the illegal diversion of alcohol and tobacco products

Attorney General William P. Barr announced Lombardo's appointment April 24 and she was sworn-in as head of the agency on Wednesday, replacing retiring Deputy Director Thomas Brandon.

In a statement, Barr said Lombardo has proven herself an outstanding leader.

""She is well qualified to continue ATF's successes of recent years, including helping the Department investigate and prosecute more firearms offenders than ever before,"" he said.

Lombardo, speaking from ATF headquarters in Washington, D.C., said her heart is usually split between Southwest Florida and New York, where her family originally settled.

Where the heart is

""I still fight with that,"" she said. ""I go back to where my family is, where my heart is. When I go back to Fort Myers, it makes me feel peaceful. It still feels like home.""

Still, she loves her New York travels.

She also considers her path to the ATF a bit unorthodox, going from a family that had a legitimate liquor business to an agency that targets illicit liquor activities.

The Lombardos have roots that go deep into New York's past — she said one part of the family has the second liquor license issued — and they operated a wine and liquor business in East Harlem in the 1920s.

""We took out what we knew and brought it to Fort Myers,"" she said.

No surprise to mom

Her promotion to the top came as no surprise to her mom, Milly Lombardo, 86, and older sister Rosemarie Lombardo, 63, both of whom still live in Southwest Florida.

""Mom is excited, and proud ... and worried,"" Rosemarie Lombardo said. She then added with a chuckle: ""She's not worried about the criminals, she's worried about Washington D.C.""

Rosemarie Lombardo, oldest of the four Lombardo children, said her little sister was no ballerina type.

""She was rough and tumble,"" she said. ""She was a very hard worker and determined. But she was friendly and sociable too.""

Rosemarie Lombardo said her sister worked at the family business in Cape Coral, Lombardo's Italian Deli and Bakery, started in New York by their grandparents.

Reggie Lombardo said the deli here first opened as an Italian food shop in Fort Myers on U.S. 41 and moved to the larger deli location in Cape Coral in 1979. Her parents closed it at the end of 2000.

""I don't think work (at the deli) was her first passion,"" Rosemarie Lombardo said.

That restaurant experience obviously stayed with her, Rosemarie Lombardo said. ""She is an avid cook,"" she said. ""She knows her food.""

Reggie Lombardo readily agreed.

""One of my passions is to cook,"" she said. ""That's where my creative side comes out.""

Her sister said Reggie Lombardo, along with her brother, Raphael, were also interested in dancing and would serve as hair style models when top local stylist Valentino did hair shows.

""We competed in disco and danced at the Edison pageant,"" Reggie Lombardo said.

Just a year apart in age from her brother, his death in 1996 devastated her.

""It was the greatest heartbreak of my life,"" she said.

Carolyn Rogers, of Fort Myers, said she and Lombardo went to school together, graduating from Bishop Verot High School in Fort Myers in 1981.

""My heart is full of pride for her today,"" Rogers said.

She remembers when the Lombardos moved to Cape Coral in the 1970s, the new ATF head was in fourth grade and the city was still fairly unpopulated.

""There was no more than 10,000 people living there,"" Rogers said.

Rogers remembered Lombardo working at the family business for a number of years.

""She’s beautiful, kind and amazing,"" she said. ""And quite an athlete in her day.""

Reggie Lombardo went to college assisted by a softball scholarship.

She figured out her future in college segueing from education to law and then to law enforcement.

""Not a lot of women wanted to work on bombs and explosives,"" she said. ""It was more of a challenge. That's what triggered me to focus.""

The new director is close to the mandatory retirement age for federal agency workers — 57 — but an extension isn't outside the realm of possibilities.

""Whatever role they want me to play,"" she said. ""I am willing, no discussions.""

""Mom is excited, and proud ... and worried,"" Rosemarie Lombardo said. She then added with a chuckle: ""She's not worried about the criminals, she's worried about Washington D.C.""

Rosemarie Lombardo, oldest of the four Lombardo children, said her little sister was no ballerina type growing up.

""She was rough and tumble,"" she said. ""She was a very hard worker and determined. But she was friendly and sociable too.""

Rosemarie Lombardo said her sister worked at the family business in Cape Coral, Lombardo's Italian Deli and Bakery, which was actually started in New York by their grandparents.

Actually, Reggie Lombardo said, the deli here first opened as an Italian food shop in Fort Myers on U.S. 41 and moved to the larger deli location in Cape Coral in 1979. Her parents closed it at the end of 2000.

""I don't think work (at the deli) was her first passion,"" Rosemarie said. ""It was always there, it wasn't punishment. It was very lighthearted.""

Rosemarie Lombardo said her sister did well working at the deli and was good with the customers and later helped her in a pasta-making enterprise.

That restaurant experience obviously stayed with her, her sister said. ""She is an avid cook,"" she said. ""She knows her food.""

Reggie Lombardo readily agreed.

""One of my passions is to cook,"" she said. ""That's where my creative side comes out.""

Her sister said Reggie Lombardo, along with her brother, Raphael, were also interested in dancing and would serve as hair style models when top local stylist Valentino did hair shows.

""We competed in disco and danced at the Edison pageant,"" Reggie Lombardo said.

Just a year apart in age from her brother, his death in 1996 devastated her.

""It was the greatest heartbreak of my life,"" she said.

Carolyn Rogers of Fort Myers said she and Lombardo went to school together, graduating from Bishop Verot High School in Fort Myers in 1981. She said that Reggie Lombardo was class president one year and was always a leader and a hard worker.

""My heart is full of pride for her today,"" Rogers said.

She remembers when the Lombardos moved to Cape Coral in the 1970s when the new ATF head was in fourth grade and the city was still fairly unpopulated.

""There was no more than 10,000 people living there ... in the early 70s,"" Rogers said.

She said growing up in New York gave Lombardo ""street smarts"" and likely helped her as she rose through the ATF ranks.

Rogers remembered Lombardo working at the family business for a number of years.

""She’s beautiful, kind and amazing,"" she said. ""And quite an athlete in her day.""

Rosemarie Lombardo agreed with Rogers' assessment.

""Sports was her passion,"" she said. ""She was an avid softball player. I think she even played on one of the boys' teams.""

That sports activity helped her as she went to college assisted by a softball scholarship.

She figured out her future in college segueing from education to law and then to law enforcement.

""Not a lot of women wanted to work on bombs and explosives,"" she said. ""It was more of a challenge. That's what triggered me to focus.""

The new director is close to the mandatory retirement age for federal agency workers, 57, but an extension isn't outside the realm of possibilities.

""Whatever role they want me to play,"" she said. ""I am willing, no discussions.""

1066,Texas firefighters finish pouring concrete for man who had medical emergency,"CARROLLTON, Texas – Off-duty firefighters went above and beyond their calling for a patient having a medical emergency when they went to his home on their day off to finish a project he had started.

According to a Facebook post, a man had a medical emergency while pouring concrete around his home. Rescue crews from the Carrollton Fire Department quickly responded and brought him to a hospital.

Concerned his concrete and hard work would go to waste if left unattended, the first responders called off-duty firefighters to finish the job for him. One even brought his own tools to help with the work.

1067,DUI charges for man who crashed into cruiser – on tractor,"- Police in Haines City say a 68-year-old man -- whose license has been suspended for 41 years -- was drunk when he drove his lawn tractor into a police cruiser Saturday evening.

According to police, the HCPD vehicle was parked at Rodriguez Fashion along U.S. Highway 17/92. Around 7 p.m., the officer heard a loud noise and walked outside to find Gary Wayne Anderson aboard a mower and noticed “minor damage” to the plastic portion of the police vehicle’s rear bumper.

Anderson, 68, allegedly admitted that he hit the vehicle and that he was drunk, though he denied causing any damage. Police say his demeanor ranged from laughing to aggressive as he failed to complete the field sobriety tests, so they took him into custody.

At the police station, he claimed that he had been poisoned by police and asked to be taken to a hospital. Officers complied and took him to Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, where his blood-alcohol content was measured at .241 – more than three times the legal limit.

Police say there was also cocaine in Anderson’s system. When they confronted him about it, he allegedly accused the officers of giving it to him and responded with foul language and racial slurs.

According to officers, Anderson’s driver’s license has been suspended since March of 1978. He has two prior DUI convictions and now faces new misdemeanor charges of DUI and refusal to submit to a DUI test.

Anderson’s lawn mower and its attached trailer were towed, police noted.

“I’m proud of the professional demeanor our officers showed when dealing with this heavily-intoxicated, belligerent offender,” Chief Jim Elensky said. “It’s never a good idea to get behind the wheel drunk, even if that wheel is to a Craftsman, Massey Ferguson or John Deere.”",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/dui-charges-for-man-who-crashed-into-cruiser-on-tractor,2019-05-06T15:01:55Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Florida Man,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609

The man, Larry Brock of Marianna, was standing near the truck as the driver dumped a load of dirt in his yard, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

The truck’s driver, Terry Wilson, 63, of Altha, pulled the truck forward to make sure all the dirt had emptied. When he did so, the raised dump bed snagged an overhead power line, which fell on Brock and electrocuted him.

Brock was pronounced dead at the scene by Jackson County fire rescue personnel.

1073,Florida nurse fights to change EMS policies after video of son's care at crash scene,"CLOSE Watch the video that may have inspired Dr. Rayme Edler to pursue reform of Escambia County EMS. Courtesy of Dawn Bybee, Pensacola News Journal

Story Highlights A 2017 video shows an EMS crew appearing to respond callously to a call of two people hit by an SUV.

Escambia County officials met in Jan. 2018 with the mother of one of the men.

Almost two years after the accident, Escambia County updated it's policy reviewing EMS performance

Other families are coming forward to share their story

Sean Harris, 28, was five days away from his wedding when he died in a hospital bed on May 16, 2017.

He was struck by an SUV the night before while out with his friends celebrating his bachelor party. The group was crossing Pine Forest Road from a Circle K gas station in Pensacola, Florida when, as his friends would describe to his mother later, a car came out of nowhere.

The response by Escambia County Emergency Medical Services to the crash was captured on video. The lack of care portrayed in the video propelled Dawn Bybee, a nurse and the mother of Harris, to work for nearly two years to get EMS to change how it handles patient care.

Her uphill battle is indicative of the lack of urgency surrounding the ongoing issues alleged in the county's EMS division. New Escambia County Medical Director Dr. Rayme Edler raised questions about how training was done in the county after taking over in May 2018, and the EMS Chief resigned in June 2018.

The investigation into EMS training has been turned over the state and the county has launched its own evaluation of the county's Public Safety Department.

While Edler's complaints weren’t official until she took over as medical director, her concerns with EMS care began at least as early as that 2017 video showing the lack of care received by Harris and friend Gary ""Chris"" Surgner, who also died from his injuries.

One of the first people Bybee shared the video with was Edler, months before she became the county's medical director.

The video

In the minutes after the crash, Escambia County EMS responded and the driver of the SUV, who at that point was standing on the side of the road, took out his phone and began to film the scene.

Bybee said she was at home putting together flowers and crafts for her son's wedding when she received the call that he had been struck by a vehicle.

Harris passed away the next day in a hospital surrounded by friends and family. His mother said she remembers many of the women there, including herself, still had their nails painted lavender, one of the colors for the wedding.

In the months after her son's death, Bybee gathered every record she could, including the video, which was part of the police record.

Sean Harris and his mother Dawn Bybee (Photo: Courtesy of Dawn Bybee)

She watched the video with her husband, Toby Bybee, who is also a nurse. They were both horrified at how the emergency medical technicians and paramedics handled the situation.

The video shows two members of the EMS crew who responded walk around Harris and Surgner, lift them up to check their pulse without care to protect their necks, then allow them to flop back on the ground, potentially cutting off their airways. They next dug around in their pockets before beginning treatment.

""What you see on the video is below sub-par care,"" Dawn Bybee said. ""I've said that it's no care.""

When she showed Edler — then a doctor at Baptist Hospital — the video, Bybee said Edler was outraged by what she saw. Edler began her career as an EMT and paramedic in New Orleans before getting her medical degree and moving to Pensacola as an emergency room doctor.

Edler declined to comment for this story, saying since she is a county employee, she must receive authorization from the county administrator before speaking with the media. The News Journal has requested an interview through the county.

""A paramedic digs through my son's pockets at one minute and 29 seconds into the video, but yet he's never secured an airway,"" Dawn Bybee said, describing the video. ""He's never secured his head, his neck, his spine, rolled him over. They are just walking around on scene.""

Neglected: Even when staffs cause patient deaths, Florida nursing homes face few penalties

Also: Most Florida nursing homes don't have generators despite new requirement after Irma deaths

And — Could review teams prevent deaths of elderly patients by Florida nursing homes?

Her husband pointed out that how EMS staff checked for a pulse, allowing both men to flop back on the ground, could have caused neck and head injuries.

""If they would've had the ability to live, and their injuries weren't substantial, they (the EMT and paramedic) would've caused more injury to that patient,"" he said.

Harris was placed on a stretcher with one medic grabbing his underarms, another man lifting him by his belt loops and a third person, one of Harris' friends, lifting his feet.

Surgner was given a backboard, provided by firefighters who by that point had arrived on scene, to be placed onto the stretcher.

Dawn Bybee said her first thought when she saw EMS checking for the pulse and allowing the men to flop back to the ground was that those actions could have cut off their airways.

""That's all I thought about when I saw that. If he had a broken neck, like Toby said, any chance of survival ... "" she said, unable to finish the last words of her sentence.

County spokeswoman Joy Tsubooka said both of the EMS crew members who responded to the call are no longer employed with the county's Public Safety Department. Tsubooka said one member of the crew was fired from the county, and the other resigned ""to go to a fire school.""

Opening Pandora's box

Dawn Bybee said she thought her son's case was an isolated incident. But after another experience her husband had with Escambia County EMS in which he allegedly witnessed lack of care for a patient, she decided to bring her son's case to the attention of EMS administration.

She dropped off the video of her son's incident in September 2017 for then-Deputy EMS Chief Leon Salter. She talked to Salter on the phone a few times asking for a meeting, but he never called back.

Salter is now interim EMS manager.

After getting no response from EMS staff, she went to her commissioner, who at the time was Grover Robinson, now mayor of Pensacola.

Robinson agreed to meet with her and set up the meeting for Jan. 30, 2018. His office sent out an email about the meeting telling her County Administrator Jack Brown, Assistant Administrator Matt Coughlin and Public Safety Director Mike Weaver would be at the meeting. EMS is part of the Public Safety Department.

""When I saw Mike Weaver's name, I got mad,"" Dawn Bybee said. ""I was like well, I've already tried to talk to them. This is so ridiculous. I was so mad, so I put it on social media.""

She posted her story on the Escambia Citizens Watch Facebook group, and invited other concerned citizens to come with her to the meeting.

She was joined by 13 other people who sat silently in support as she described her son’s injuries and presented to the county their own protocols on responding to trauma. One of the people who joined her was Edler.

Then she played the video, and she said there was silence in the room.

Another meeting was held Feb. 14, 2018, and officials promised change, as well as a patient advocacy program to hand out cards with contact information to patients.

""I will say Mike Weaver was the only one, that sat back and said, 'What you see in the video is awful, and I'm sorry,"" Dawn Bybee said. ""He's the only one ever that has apologized.""

Edler was named medical director on April 17, 2018.

New medical director: Escambia County names new medical director for public safety and jail

Once news started coming out in recent weeks that Edler had raised concerns about the department, a state investigation had been filed and officials were resigning, Bybee said she thought to herself ""Pandora's Box had been opened.""

She went back and looked at her email with Brown and the Public Safety leaders after the January 2018 meeting.

""The last sentence (of the email) says, 'Sean's case very well may be the foundation for change,'"" she said. ""And when I read that, I decided to go public because, why has it taken this long?""

When asked for comment Friday about Bybee's story, county spokeswoman Kaycee Lagarde said the county had created customer service cards ""as an effort to improve patient outreach and quality assurance."" She said the cards are given out by EMS staff to patients and have contact information for EMS staff, including the EMS shift commander and deputy chief, public safety director, assistant county administrator, county administrator and EMS billing.

""Escambia County EMS also participates in the District 1 EMS Council of Northwest Florida, which actively works to improve and promote patient care and patient outcomes,"" Lagarde said.

The county also has a public safety quality assurance and quality improvement policy that it follows, however, the policy was updated this year.

""When areas for improvement are discovered through the QA (quality assurance) process, they will be addressed with additional training and procedural improvements as necessary according to the QA policy,"" Lagarde said.

Lagarde provided the News Journal with a copy of the policy. It was adopted by the county on March 12, 2019, signed off by Edler, more than a year after the initial meetings.

The previous policy, also provided to the News Journal by the county, dates from 2011 and says it's meant to meant to comply with federal and state law.

The old policy didn't specify what issues need to be reviewed or who can raise an issue to QA besides field training officers and employees. It recommended employees fill out the form for ""At-a-boys,"" but made no mention of medical issues or errors. Rather, much of the old policy was more focused on the proper way to fill out the county's software form.

The new policy calls specifically for EMTs and paramedics to receive remedial training if an issue is raised. It also allows any family member, other county staff member, hospital staff or member of the public with direct knowledge of an incident to file complaints and begin the quality assurance process.

No accountability

Other parents have reached out to Bybee to share their stories and experiences with EMS. Jackie and Tony Nichols tried to raise questions with the county over their son's death nearly five years ago.

Aubrey Nichols was 28 in 2014 when he died after suffering from cardiac arrest from a heart defect. He was a musician in the popular local Pensacola band Timberhawk.

His father said Nichols was a self-taught musician who was well liked by everyone and had a great group of friends.

""His big thing for his birthday is they'd boil hot dogs,"" he said. ""It was like the big thing on his birthday. It was just so goofy.""

Aubrey Nichols (Photo: Courtesy of Jackie Nichols)

In 2014, Aubrey Nichols said he felt like he was having a heart attack, and EMS responded. His mother, who is also a nurse, remembers seeing her son in the hospital and noticing that first repsonders had performed a field intubation.

Months later when the family received the hospital bill, she noticed it read that an intubation had also been done at the hospital. The family later found out that the EMS intubation had been botched and another intubation was done at the hospital. During the ambulance ride, instead of air flowing into Nichols' lungs, it was being forced into his stomach.

""My son didn't have to die,"" Jackie Nichols said.

The crash: One killed, one critical after pedestrian crash

Because of a Florida law that prevents parents from suing for wrongful death on behalf of their children older than 25, and since both Bybee's and Nichols' sons were unmarried, they were left with no way to hold the county accountable through a court.

In 2010, the American Heart Association released new protocols that called for treatment of circulation issues before dealing with breathing. The Nichols argue if EMS was following that protocol, a field intubation should have never been attempted.

""The fact that they prevented him from getting oxygen by not following the guidelines, they took away any chance he had of surviving,"" TonyNichols said.

Not able to go to court, Jackie Nichols tried approaching EMS administration to tell her story and find out what could be done to stop it from happening in the future. She said they weren't interested in talking to her, telling her ""mistakes happen.""

""They really did not seem interested in a solution,"" she said. ""They asked me, what do you want us to do, do you want this paramedic to lose his job? No, I don't want anyone to lose their job. I want them to be able to function properly in their job.""

She said she takes away one positive from her son's death.

""My son was an organ donor and gave the gift of life to 82 people,"" she said, adding that even a part of his defective heart was used to save someone's life.

Both the Bybees and the Nichols said they are working to ensure this doesn't happen to other parents. And, they said, they believe that 99% of paramedics and EMTs correctly perform their jobs, which they say is one of the toughest jobs in medicine.

""I think the culture is willing to change now,"" Dawn Bybee said. ""Has it been exposed? Has it been? That's the question.""

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - Chick-fil-A is a restaurant on a roll.

It's a restaurant that has enjoyed unprecedented growth as well as huge revenues - and they're even closed on Sundays.

Gus Mir, a Tampa Bay area man who's been there from the beginning, goes On the Bench With Benson this week to discuss the quirks, secrets and controversy around one of the hottest fast food chains going.

You can watch their full interview above.

Josh: Hey Gus, thanks for being here.

Gus: My pleasure.

Josh: Have a seat.

Gus: Thank you.

Josh: Did you ever envision that you'd dedicate your life around the chicken?

Gus: I was attracted to Chick-fil-A because I was 15 years old and I wanted a job. So I started working for Doris Williams in 1981.

Josh: So she opened the very first Chick-fil-A?

Gus: She opened the very first mall restaurant in 1967.

Josh: So she knew what she was doing?

Gus: She sure did.

Josh: Tell us what you do for Chick-fil-A.

Gus: Well, I'm a restaurant operator, I have two individual franchises in Pinellas County.

Josh: Is Chick-fil-A downright owning the fast food industry right now?

Gus: Well, we've experienced really unprecedented growth for our company. The cornerstones are just a great restaurant experience, great quality, served by great people.

Josh: When you see people wrapped around the building and for someone who's never been there, they think, ""Naw, I'm not going to wait."" But you can get them through pretty quickly.

Gus: We do. And think about it, we're serving about 140 guests in the drive-thru in one of our peak hours. That's a car at the window every 24 seconds. Somewhere in there.

Josh: I read a stat that you use more lemons than the country of Japan.

Gus: Our freshly squeezed lemonade is one of our cornerstone menu items.

Josh: But that takes a lot of time.

Gus: It takes a lot of time, every lemon is freshly squeezed in the restaurant.

Josh: When I pull up, I see a really happy person, a very polite person. They have the food ready. It's rarely wrong, if ever. What's the secret there?

Gus: We select enthusiastic people. People that love other people and serving guests. And we see some of the faces literally three to five times per week.

Josh: The franchise, I heard, it's not that expensive - is that true?

Gus: It's not that expensive. It's a franchise fee upfront, it doesn't take a lot of working capital but it does take active involvement in the business.

Josh: But it's competitive.

Gus: It's very competitive. Sometimes it's harder to get into the C.F.A. (Chick-fil-A), then the C.I.A. because of their selection standards.

Josh: What has it done to allow you to tap into the community?

Gus: It's really given us a foundation where we are able to take good care of people in the community. We rallied 400 team members at the USF Sun Dome last fall and assembled 167,000 meals for Feeding Children Everywhere.

Josh: There has been a little bit of controversy I wanted to ask you about, alleged funding for anti-LGTBQ organizations. Surely you must be asked about that.

Gus: Josh, I would tell you that a simple question that you asked deserves a simple answer. And that is we're a restaurant company that's focused on great food, served by great people in a warm and welcoming environment for everyone. That's my simple answer.

Josh: What is the hardest party of running your franchises right now?

Gus: The hardest part is keeping and retaining great people.

Josh: Well thanks so much for being with us, Gus.

Gus: Thank you.

Josh: Appreciate it, have a great day.

1079,"It's part boat, part car and all fun. Meet the captain of Pensacola's boat car","Gerry Moore gets a lot of strange looks when he's out driving his Ford Expedition.

People roll down their windows, stick their phones out and take photos. Others slam on the brakes to do a double-take. Pedestrians walking by stand open-mouthed, then quickly reach into their bags to get their cameras.

Gerry is a good-looking guy, always wearing a white sailor's cap and he usually has a cigar dangling from his lips. His wife, Karen, is blonde and beautiful, and is usually sitting in the passenger's seat, waving at onlookers. Maybe that's why everyone wants to take photos.

Or perhaps it's because Gerry sawed off the top half of his Ford Expedition and replaced it with the top half of a 1986 Chris Craft Scorpion 210, an old boat he had sitting in his backyard for years.

""It definitely gets a reaction out of people,"" Gerry says with a laugh. ""Everybody smiles, they really do.""

""It's such a joy to see people's reactions,"" Karen says. ""They either have their camera out, or they're smiling and waving. Many of them just bust out laughing.""

Yes, it drives just like a car, and no, it doesn't float

Gerry first got the idea to build his ""boat car,"" as he calls it, at a car show in Mississippi late last year.

He saw a similar, smaller car/boat hybrid, and thought of the old Chris Craft he had sitting in his backyard off of Nine Mile Road in Pensacola. He'd been mulling refurbishing the boat for years, but never got around to spending the money to bring it back to life.

""So when I saw that boat car, I told my wife, 'That's what we're doing with our boat,'"" Gerry says. ""She said, 'I don't know how you are going to do that.'""

Gerry, who works as a poker dealer at the Pensacola Greyhound Track, grew up fixing cars with his dad in Little Rock, Arkansas. His dad owned several car service stations, and Gerry has always been comfortable tinkering with automobiles.

But his boat car project was one that he'd never done before. He measured his Cadillac Escalade and his boat and determined they'd be the perfect fit for one another, but Karen wouldn't let him chop the Escalade to pieces. So he found an old Ford Expedition that had front end damage and bought it for cheap.

""I didn't mind that it had front end damage,"" Gerry says. ""I cut the whole front end off anyways.""

Gerry worked for six weeks merging the boat and car together — ""That Chris Craft was built a little too good, I went through about 20 saws just to get the bottom off,"" he says — and eventually his masterpiece was complete. The boat car has the wheels, bottom frame, seats and steering wheel of the Expedition, but the body of the Chris Craft. It seats eight people and gets about 20 miles to the gallon.

And no, it doesn't float.

Gerry and Karen took the boat car, which they named ""Tsunami,"" for its first spin in Pensacola on Feb. 15, and the farthest he's driven since then is to Panama City and back. The boat car operates and drives just like an SUV and is licensed and insured as the Expedition. Gerry says he's been pulled over by the police ""around 10 times"" — but instead of writing him a ticket, they snap a picture.

""It's considered a Ford Expedition, with a slight body modification,"" he says with a laugh.

A lot of looks, laughs and smiles from perfect strangers

So, what's the point of spending six weeks creating a boat/car hybrid that Gerry and Karen just drive around for fun?

They both say it's the reactions they get from people that make it worthwhile.

Gerry survived thyroid cancer that metastasized to his lungs, and Karen is a two-time breast cancer survivor. They both still work, and are busy with three kids and nine grandkids. But they enjoy driving the boat car around in their free time, taking photos with people and giving rides to people to see the joy that it brings.

""I can have a rough day at work, and when I get home, he'll say, 'Let's go for a ride,'"" Karen says.

Gerry ordered several captains hats, like the one he wears, to give out to little kids who are fascinated by the boat car. One interaction with a little girl at a car show a few weeks ago still makes him tear up when he talks about it.

""There was a little girl who had leukemia, so I put her in the boat and gave her a captain's hat,"" Gerry says. ""Seeing a reaction like that in a child is no different than seeing these bums on the corner who have no food or anything else. Everybody's response is to wave and smile, and it just makes their day. And more importantly, it makes ours.""

""It tickles them to death to see the boat,"" Karen says of the little kids. ""And to have a hat like he has, that makes it so much more special.""

The Moores are open to the idea of letting people ""rent"" the boat car (with Gerry as its captain) for weddings or other events. It made its first big public debut at the Pensacola Grand Mardi Gras parade in March.

But for the most part, the Moores aren't looking to make a monetary profit off their ride. The reward they get from it is driving down Palafox Street and having people stop on the sidewalks to take photos, or pulling up next to people at stoplights and having the cars next to them roll down their windows to ask questions and laugh. The boat car makes people happy — and that's what makes Gerry and Karen happy, too.

""One time we pulled in by the beach ball (water tower) here on Pensacola Beach,"" Gerry says. ""And seven Marines came up to me and said, 'You just made our whole vacation.' You can't put a price on reactions like that.""

1080,In the Know: Self-storage businesses being built 'like Dollar Generals' in Lee County,"We sure have a lot of stuff.

Boxes of stuff in the garage. Boxes of stuff in storage sheds.

Up north, people have more places to store stuff than people down south: Basement space for boxes. Attic space for more.

In my den, I have drawers full of files, a closet full of newspaper clips and bookshelves laden with books I haven't read in years but do not dare throw or give away.

In Lee County, to where more than 16,000 people moved from 2017 to 2018, there are no below-ground basements. Few homes have attic storage space either. Some newer housing developments have codes that prevent storage sheds.

With our population inflating, first past 500,000, then toward 750,000 and onward to a million, many just don’t have room for stuff.

Why throw or give stuff away? We are Americans. Until death do we part with our stuff.

With that mantra in mind, more and more self-storage units are being constructed. And they are going up in prominent, visible real estate locations.

“The secret sauce in self-storage is to find locations where the average home is older than you would think,” said Gary Tasman, founder of the Fort Myers real estate firm, Cushman and Wakefield. His firm produced a 19-page report, all about self-storage.

It concluded: in addition to the area’s newcomers, we have young millennials renting apartments without enough storage space. And we have retiring Baby Boomers – about 10,000 turn 65 every day – who are downsizing but maybe can’t quite get rid of family heirlooms because their children and grandchildren don’t have the space for them. Another conclusion: self-storage facilities are recession proof.

“Downsizing, death, divorce and dislocation.” Those were four factors that play into the rise of self-storage businesses, Tasman’s report said.

There are 300,000 items in the average American home, and we spend $1.2 trillion per year on non-essential goods, the L.A. Times reported.

“In a world of excessive consumption and unnecessary accumulation, minimalism continues to contribute to the rapid growth of self-storage areas,” Tasman’s report concluded.

That’s irony, because there’s nothing minimalist about clearing your house of clutter, only to pay somebody $30-$120 or more a month to store it off U.S. 41, State Road 80, Skyline Boulevard or Colonial Boulevard. All four of those roads in Cape Coral and Fort Myers have new self-storage businesses in the works.

For this week’s “In the Know” column, here’s an extended update on new places to store old stuff:

FROM FEDEX TO SPACEBOX: Construction on one of the largest commercial real estate deals in Fort Myers from 2018 hopefully will not wreak havoc on traffic at one of Lee County’s busiest throughways.

That will be up to Cape Coral and Fort Myers commuters and whether they slow down for a look-see at 2670 Colonial Blvd., former home of a FedEx distribution facility and future home of SpaceBox, a climate-controlled storage facility, across the street from a Super 8 Motel.

On the south side of the road and located just west of where the railroad tracks cross Colonial Boulevard and the northern entrance of John Yarbrough Linear Park, the 92,164-square-foot former FedEx building’s facelift began last month.

The 10 acres of land sold last June for $6.4 million.

Almost 60,000 cars per day in both directions pass by that location, according to the Florida Department of Transportation. With the Colonial Boulevard corridor exploding in development, this will be yet another place to store some stuff.

MODERN-DAY CAVES: Kevin Cloutier, a real estate agent, has booked the first eight of 10 units of the Caves in Cape Coral, to be built at 4329 SW 9th Ave., off Skyline Boulevard. The final two units are available for about $227,000. Construction is set to begin any day now.

These will be glorified man caves, more like a second home for storing more stuff than a storage shed. Think classic cars, pickup trucks and boats, not lawn mowers and boxes.

“We finally got the permit to begin building the caves,” Cloutier said. “There are two projects that we’ve got going on there. The one on the right is self-storage. And the Caves have finally been approved. We changed it from steel exterior walls to concrete block walls. That allowed us to have a sturdier building from a hurricane or anything like that. We just had it approved and have the permits in hand. We’re moving dirt as soon as possible.”

SKYLINE SELF STORAGE: Adjacent to the Caves, John Ringland, a Cape Coral developer, is building the 53,000-square-foot Skyline Self Storage. That address is 824 SW 42nd Terrace, at the corner with Skyline.

There will be 450 storage units of varying sizes.

“We have seven buildings going up,” Ringland said. “We are really going high-tech with ours with motion detectors and solar power. There are no key locks at our facility. Everything will be Bluetooth from your phone.

“We will have the largest solar fields in LCEC territory. It will provide at least 100 percent of the power for our storage facility.”

Cloutier predicted more storage units to sprout throughout Lee County.

“These things fill up as soon as you build them,” he said. “The self-storage things really do quite well. They’re putting them up like Dollar Generals. It’s like there’s one on every corner.”

BOAT STORAGE COMING SOON: The Matanzas Pass Bridge won’t be looking different soon, but the view on the way to Fort Myers Beach already has changed.

Gulf Star Marina, billed as “the star of boat storage,” is being constructed at 708 Fisherman’s Wharf, adjacent to the Fort Myers Beach Doc Ford’s restaurant.

The web site, gulfstarmarina.com, said the facility will have “smart technology,” enabling boat owners to get back on the water in seven minutes flat. The building, scheduled to be completed later this year, will be able to withstand hurricane-force winds of up to 200 miles per hour, the site said.

THE BABCOCK EFFECT: As Babcock Ranch fills in with residents, they will need places to store their stuff. That’s why developer Jim Magnus is building a self-storage unit near the corner of State Road 80 and State Road 31. That corner also will be home to a future RaceTrac gas station and a commercial development at the hard corner there.

RACING FOR MORE RACETRACS: Some of you are wondering what is being built at the corner of Winkler Road and Summerlin Boulevard, just north of HealthPark Medical Center.

It's another RaceTrac gas station. But this won’t be just any RaceTrac.

It’s the newest model, a prototype for future locations. So yes, even more RaceTracs are on the way.

This will be the franchise’s 20th Lee County location at yet another strategic, corner location with high visibility. Construction crews have been clearing the land for the station, not far from a 7-Eleven across Summerlin and just south of a Shell Station that fell into disrepair after the construction of the flyover from Gladiolus to Summerlin.

RaceTrac paid $1.8 million for the land at 15820 Winkler Road on Nov. 6, 2018. Construction is slated to be done between late fall and the end of the year, said Megan Shannon of RaceTrac. The inside will have about 5,500 square feet, about the same as the other Lee County stores but with new and more amenities.

“This store will be our latest store model,” Shannon said. “It will feature a Swirl World frozen dessert station with up to 10 flavors and 41 toppings and a large coffee station with enough counter space to create the perfect cup of freshly ground, freshly brewed, on-demand coffee. Our newer stores have a more shoppable layout, free Wi-Fi and more lighting in the store and parking lot to deliver a better guest experience.”

1083,"FDA OKs smokeless cigarette sales, but can they help you quit?","Advertisement FDA OKs smokeless cigarette sales, but can they help you quit? New device approved by Food and Drug Administration Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Quitting smoking isn’t easy. Some doctors hoped vaping would transition people off cigarettes, but now there are questions about what vaping does to your health, too. Philip Morris International was recently approved to sell a pen-like device called IQOS that’s halfway between a vape pen and a cigarette. It’s been sold in other countries for about three years, and the FDA agreed to permit the sale of it in the U.S. last week. It’s considered a “heat not burn” device, and it’s kind of like a vape pen but uses tobacco instead of liquid nicotine. The FDA acknowledges that “the products produce fewer or lower levels of some toxins than combustible cigarettes.” That’s good, since when burned, cigarettes create more than 7,000 chemicals and the FDA agrees that IQOS delivers less carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and acrolein. It can’t yet be marketed as a “safer” cigarette, the FDA says, and there’s also no evidence it helps users quit actual cigarettes, points out Dr. Michael Roizen, chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic. So why would you use it? In The New York Times, André Calantzopoulos, the chief executive officer of Philip Morris International, says “the IQOS offers a smoke-free alternative to continued smoking.” Better ways to quitDon’t let that be good enough for you. “There are many proven ways to quit smoking,” Roizen said. Nicotine replacement patches and prescription medications like Chantix and Zyban have track records, he says, adding that peer support is essential, too. In the Cleveland Clinic Wellness smoking cessation program, they’ve seen a 63 percent success rate in quitting among 5,000 people using a combination of nicotine patches, prescription medications and coaching. What many people who want to quit overlook is that “you have to replace the habit of smoking with something else, like activity,” Roizen said. He recommends creating a quit plan, as does the National Cancer Institute, wherein you choose a date for quitting. Then, Roizen recommends racking up success by doing your smoking replacement every day until you quit. Suppose your smoking replacement is push-ups. Practice doing them every day before you give up cigarettes, so you go into the process with a track record of success. Research has found even Twitter and milk can help you out, too. If you don’t have a coach or buddy in the game with you, the National Cancer Institute has two free apps — quitSTART and QuitGuide — that promise support and motivation along your way to kicking the habit.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/smokeless-cigarette-iqos/27376063,2019-05-06T18:06:00Z,WPBF-TV,Florida Man,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

1086,"Myths about lovebugs are harder to kill than the pesky insect that plagues Floridians, visitors","CLOSE Lovebugs, those pesky poor fliers are a nuisance but thankfully they are short-lived. Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

No, they aren't some genetic experiment gone wrong, just the usual swarm that splatters its way across Florida twice a year.

They don't belong here, though, and are surely here to stay.

Lovebugs live just three or four days, packing plenty of annoyance into short lifespans. They madden motorists as they splatter their guts on windshields and hoods.

They gross out joggers and cyclists as they land in their mouths. And they stress out the chronically clean as they speckle otherwise immaculate white walls of beachside resorts and condos almost completely black. Someone's got to clean them up.

More: Cool front moving across state could bring torrential rain, strong wind gusts to Treasure Coast

There's nothing illusory about their gooey impacts. Those are as clear as day on our windshields. But many myths persist about the lowly lovebug: Do they bite or spread disease. How did they get here? Are the white splotches they leave behind acidic?

Norman Leppla, an entomologist at University of Florida, has spent years debunking the multitude of lovebug myths, in his presentations for UF's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS).

For starters, he says, lovebugs weren't genetically modified and then released by UF scientists as a way to rid the state of mosquitoes, Leppla assures. They don't even eat mosquitoes.

They are an invasive species, however. They emigrated into Texas and Louisiana from Central America in the 1920s, Leppla says. They didn't show up in Florida until the 1940s, and Brevard until the 1970s, when they were much worse than now. Their spread in Florida may have been helped along by prevailing winds, vehicle traffic, sod transport, expansion of pastures, and increased habitat along highways, UF researchers suspect.

More: Consistent rain increases mosquitoes, gator, love bug sightings on Treasure Coast

""They came to Florida just after World War II, we think pretty much by themselves, across the Yucatan,"" Leppla says in an IFAS educational video about the bug. ""And they radiated across to Florida, and we had a lot more of them then than we do now.""

They're always around, but the infamous lovebug ""swarms"" only happen for a few weeks a year, typically in May and September, entomologists say.

Lovebugs are attracted to irradiated exhaust fumes from cars, lawnmowers and other engines, and to heat.

Males swarm over places where they know females will soon emerge. The females fly into swarms of the hovering males, typically from 8 to 10 a.m. and from 4 to 5 p.m. That's rush hour for us. So the timing can plaster lovebug carcasses all over cars as rush-hour traffic passes bug-packed Brazilian pepper trees and other roadside vegetation where the bugs live along interstates and major thoroughfares.

Up to eight males compete for each female. The lovebug ""flights"" usually only happen during daylight and temperatures above 68 degrees Fahrenheit. At night, they rest on low-growing plants.

Lovebugs don't sting or bite. They feed on plant nectar, especially sweet clover, goldenrod and Brazilian pepper.

""Lovebugs have no risk to human health whatsoever,"" Leppla assures in the IFAS video. ""They don't transmit diseases ... They couldn't bite you if they wanted to.""

The white splatter they leave on the cars is their eggs, Leppla says. ""They aren't acid and they aren't basic. They're fairly neutral. So what causes the problem is leaving those on the car, until the sun and the heat, and perhaps microorganisms cause them to be damaging.""

Over several days, bacteria increases the acidity and etches the paint. So IFAS recommends soaking the surface with water for about five minutes, then scrubbing within 15 to 20 minutes to remove most of the lovebugs without harm to automobile paint.

There really isn't any way to control lovebugs, scientists warn. Pesticides don't help. The bugs fly up into the breeze to avoid it. Few predators eat them.

Biologists say that now that lovebugs are here, they do serve an important ecological role in Florida. Lovebug larvae convert plant material into organic components that growing plants recycle for food, according to a University of Florida report.

Lovebugs add to the litany of Florida creatures that herald what's to come, biologist say.

""They tell us when it's going to be summer,"" Leppla said. ""They tell us when it's going to be fall, when they come out in September. So they're kind of an organism that brings in the seasons.""

1087,"Man rammed patrol vehicle in bid to escape, Indian River deputies say","CLOSE If you see a crime being committed, leave anonymous tips with Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers. GINNY BEAGAN/TCPALM April 2019 Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — A Port St. Lucie man tried to escape arrest Sunday by striking a Sheriff's Office patrol cruiser and leading deputies on a chase in a stolen car, an arrest report said.

Dylan Lawson, 22, is charged with aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer, grand theft auto, fleeing and eluding after a crash involving property damage, misdemeanor domestic battery and resisting arrest without violence.

He was being held Monday at the Indian River County Jail on $19,000 bail.

Indian River County deputies were searching for Lawson about 3 p.m. after a caller reported he had punched her in the head while he was riding as a passenger in her 2011 Chevrolet Malibu, the report said.

Lawson drove off with her car after she fled to a nearby residence in the 9200 block of 86th Street, south of Sebastian, deputies said.

When they found and approached Lawson in the Publix parking lot on Sebastian Boulevard, he threw his car in reverse and rammed a deputy's patrol cruiser before fleeing the scene, the report said.

Lawson ""commenced to drive around Indian River County"" for nearly an hour, ""evading numerous deputies at various speeds,"" the report stated.

Deputies contacted Lawson by phone after disabling two of his tires with spike strips and convinced him to return to the home on 86th Street. He was detained about 4:45 p.m. after a brief standoff, the report said.

Sheriff's Office spokesman Maj. Eric Flowers said the deputy in the struck vehicle was ""a little sore"" Monday but was not otherwise injured.

1089,Former Perry plant worker files discrimination lawsuit,"A former employee of a Taylor County weapons manufacturing plant has made good on filing a civil lawsuit claiming discrimination and retaliation from a higher-up.

Jackie Hendry filed a complaint with the Florida Commission on Human Relations last year but since the organization has not completed its investigation, the civil lawsuit was filed April 16 in Third Circuit Court.

Hendry claims she was terminated in retaliation for objecting to repeated sexual harassment by her supervisor at AMTEC Less-Lethal Inc., where two people were killed in an explosion.

Hendry told AMTEC’s former president about the sexual advances and advised that the building was unsafe.

Hendry said her supervisor, Vernon Wakefield, the plant’s quality control manager and head of safety, started the harassment by asking if she would have sex with a black man. She asked him to stop, but she said Wakefield created a “sexually charged work environment” that led to her being ostracized among other employees.

She was fired Aug. 10, the same day Wakefield was promoted to director of operations.

Hendry reported that another employee, manager Dina Parton, was not using antistatic scoops used to insert explosive flash powder into devices manufactured by the company.

She also reported that the manager was storing too many pounds of flash powder inside the building, beyond what was allowed by regulation, and was placing grenades on trash bags that were not anti-static and slamming them against a table to see if powder would leak.

AMTEC faced sanctions and fines last month from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

The company was purchased by PACEM Defense in October, a month after the fatal explosion. Its president, Mike Quesenberry, said on Friday that his company is not responsible for the fines levied against AMTEC.

Hendry warned that an explosion like the one that killed Christina L. Patterson and Thomas Fowler Jr. was imminent.

1091,Haines City PD: Man charged with driving drunk on lawn mower after crashing into police cruiser,"HAINES CITY — County music star George Jones would have been proud.

On Saturday, a Haines City man was arrested on drunk driving charges after police said he crashed a lawn mower into a police cruiser.

Gary Wayne Anderson, 68, crashed into the cruiser outside Rodriguez Fashion, 1100 U.S. 17/92 N., about 7 p.m. while a Haines City police officer was away from the car, police reported.

Anderson acknowledged hitting the cruiser, but offered an excuse of being drunk and said there was no damage to the car, according to a release from the HCPD.

He failed the field sobriety test and was taken to the Haines City Police Department. At the department, Anderson told officers he had been poisoned by police and demanded to be taken to a hospital, the HCPD said.

At Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, his blood-alcohol level was .241 — more than three times the legal limit of 0.08%, according to Mike Ferguson, a spokesman for the HCPD. Cocaine was also found in Anderson's system, police reported.

Anderson's mood shifted from laughing to aggressive, and at one point he directed racial slurs at an officer, police reported.

Anderson's driver's license has been suspended since 1978. He has two prior drunk driving convictions.

The crash caused minor damage to the rear bumper of the cruiser. Anderson's lawn mower and a trailer hooked to the mower were towed. A cooler could be seen in the trailer from a picture provided by police.

The most famous alcohol-related lawn mower incident involved country music icon George Jones.

In country singer Tammy Wynette’s 1979 autobiography, she wrote that she awoke at 1 a.m. to find her husband, Jones, gone from their South Lakeland home.

Jones had driven a lawn mower 10 miles down a main highway to the nearest bar, she said.

SunFest is the biggest musical festival in town. Rain or shine, the festival goes on according to SunFest website. “SunFest does not refund or exchange tickets due to inclement weather.” Downtown on Clematis Street, live performances rocked out the four stages and the streets were filled with vendors and of course dancing. However, there was a surprise act—stormy weather. Not everyone was prepared, but Laurie Jones said the acts made it all worth it. “Look at me I am soaking wet. Still good it’s only once a year,” Jones said. Jones like most festival goers, came without an umbrella or poncho. Some acts were drier than others. “Thursday night with One Republic it rained. Friday Earth Wind and Fire was awesome and that was dry and yesterday it was totally dry,” Jones said. Keith Urban posted on Facebook that the Miami airport was closed and it was preventing him on getting to play at SunFest.He was scheduled to play at 7:30 pm. SunFest confirmed that due to the weather causing unsafe conditions on the JetBlue Stage the Tears For Fears show was canceled.On a less sweeter note Thomas the Ice Cream Man has been a vendor at Sunfest for the last decade. His mini ice cream parlor on wheels serves soft old fashioned ice cream “It’s a product that people want to have when they are having a good time.

1094,Jeb Bush's education plan comes full circle | Guestview,"It was appropriate that legislators invited former Gov. Jeb Bush to visit the House this week as the big tuition-voucher bill was given final approval.

It was Bush who, a little more than 20 years ago, began Florida’s education evolution – some would call it a revolution — culminating in the near party-line vote of 76-39 for the package that will allow state tax money to be used for families to send their kids to private schools. The first time he ran for governor, Bush visited public schools all over the state in 1994 and said he was going to work for major, fundamental change in education.

Whatever else you might think of Bush, he was an idea man. He seemed to have little patience with “but we’ve always done it this way.”



He lost that year but won four years later. Republicans controlled both chambers of the Legislature by then, and Bush won legislative approval of his initial voucher plan – dubbed the “opportunity scholarship program” – only to have it stricken by the Florida Supreme Court.

A few important things have changed since then, but the fundamentals remain the same. Republicans call it “choice” – an idea Democrats like in another context, but not regarding schools – and Democrats call it wholesale robbery of the public schools. A smattering of Democrats voted for the voucher bill in the House, but the idea of providing $130 million in tax money to help low- and moderate-income families pay tuition was too much for most of their party.

That’s hardly surprising. The Florida Education Association, the state’s big teacher union, has the most sought-after political endorsement in Democratic primaries. The National Rifle Association’s approach to gun control is a model of open-minded moderation and willingness to hear both sides, compared to the FEA’s attitude toward tuition vouchers.

Parents seem to like them, though. There’s a waiting list of more than 13,000 kids who’d like to switch schools under the existing voucher program, which is funded through corporate tax credits rather than direct support from the treasury. The “Family Empowerment Scholarship Program,” as the just-passed bill is titled, raises the eligibility ceiling from $66,950 to $77,250 for a family of four seeking tuition assistance.

The Florida Supreme Court will probably like it better, too. No justices who voted on the 5-2 ruling striking down Bush’s “opportunity scholarship plan” in 2006 are still on the bench. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who will undoubtedly sign the new bill (SB 7070), appointed three new justices early this year, replacing three who’d voted against the Bush plan (among other conservative causes over the years).

The political outcome has been inevitable since last November. If Democrat Andrew Gillum had beaten DeSantis, he’d have appointed different Supreme Court justices. He’d also veto the vouchers, if the GOP-run Legislature even bothered passing the bill.

There’s a good argument that competition always improves efficiency and outcomes, even in schools. That would be valid, if the competition was fair – if private schools were held to the same standards as public schools. If they were graded A through F like public schools. If they had to take everybody, even the most troubled kids, like the public schools.

Private schools can also do a lousy job. The Orlando Sentinel did a series in 2017, “Schools Without Rules,” documenting how some private academies hired teachers without college degrees – even with criminal records – and falsified health and safety inspections. The privateers exist primarily to make money, while the public schools exist to survive annual mandates and meddling from Tallahassee.

If the kids get an education in there somehow, that’s nice too.

Some time this month, DeSantis ought to invite Bush back to the Capitol for the formal signing of the new voucher law, or take the bill down to Miami and set up a ceremony somewhere historically significant to the governor who started it all. Then he could give him the pen.

1095,Employment decision on Marco Island 'Brady cop' may be coming soon,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

A discredited Marco Island police officer's employment status has remained in limbo for more than two months, but a decision on whether he loses or retains his job may be coming soon.

City Manager David Harden said Thursday that a decision on Officer Tige Thompson, who was placed on paid administrative leave Feb. 19, may be finalized this week after the city chose to evaluate whether he could fulfill his duties as an officer despite not being able to testify at criminal trials.

""I have been waiting on a draft letter from our attorneys,"" Harden said. ""Next week, I should be able to review a draft letter and hopefully get it finalized.""

Thompson has remained a Marco Island police officer for years despite the state attorney's office conferring the do-not-subpoena status. Sometimes known as a Brady List, it identifies officers with a history of dishonesty or who can be impeached as a witness.

More: Termination recommended for Marco Island 'Brady cop' due to inability to perform duties

More: Marco Island 'Brady cop' placed on administrative leave, job in jeopardy

More: State attorney's office declined to prosecute multiple Marco Island criminal charges last month due to 'Brady cop'

The Brady List moniker was created as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in the 1963 case Brady v. Maryland, which established that prosecutors were required to turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense, including any evidence that could impeach a witness.

The state attorney's office included Thompson on the do-not-subpoena list after he was found to have given inconsistent and untruthful testimony as part of a 2011 DUI case where it eventually had to drop the charges. The state attorney's office also cited Thompson's previous termination from the Collier County Sheriff's Office as part of its rationale.

Thompson remained with the department and was reassigned to investigations following the issuance of a letter in 2013 from the state attorney's office, which stated that Thompson would not be used as a witness for the prosecution in any criminal matters.

After a follow-up letter was sent to the police department in 2015, Police Chief Al Schettino returned Thompson to patrol due to the belief that Thompson would tarnish all cases he investigated.

In June 2015, an internal affairs investigation was launched into Thompson's previous actions and determined that he was violated multiple police policies. However, because the investigation spanned more than 180 days, the department could not impose any discipline due to state law.

A copy of the internal affairs report was forwarded to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which launched its own perjury investigation. Due to the age of the case and evidentiary issues, FDLE no caused the case.

Since he was returned to patrol in 2015, records show Thompson was involved in 12 felony, 30 misdemeanor and 67 criminal traffic cases, none of which have gone to trial.

Thompson's actions warranted further scrutiny recently when a few higher profile arrests he was involved with resulted in the state attorney's office choosing not to prosecute the cases. This included one case where a Marco Island man barricaded himself in his home with a cache of weapons, which prompted SWAT to respond to the scene.

After Thompson was placed on administrative leave, Harden instructed Schettino to assess whether Thompson was able to perform the duties of the job given his inclusion on the Brady List.

In a March 18 memo to Thompson, Schettino recommended his disqualification, citing the ability to testify as an integral part of his duties.

""The Department has no control over the SAO's Brady List, but the SAO's determination has nevertheless fatally undermined your ability to perform your job,"" Schettino wrote. ""The reason being, the SAO has stated that you cannot testify. By extension, an officer who cannot be counted on to testify also cannot be counted on to make arrests, investigate cases, or carry out any other police functions that might lead to being a witness.""

While a pre-determination hearing was held on March 26, the city has held off on making a final decision on Thompson until now.

As of May 3, it would mean Thompson has been on paid leave for 74 days and counting.

From the date he was placed on the leave until now, Thompson has earned more than $13,000 in pay, according to payroll records.

Records show Thompson has been employed with the Marco Island Police Department since Nov. 13, 2006.

1099,Texas man recovering after shark bite in Boca Grande Pass,"CLOSE Paul Kelly said the worst part of the day was losing the tarpon he was trying to reel in. Fort Myers News-Press

The worst part of a Texas man's trip to Florida wasn't when he got bit by a shark on a fishing trip.

It's when he lost the tarpon he was trying to reel in.

Speaking from the Lee Memorial Hospital on Saturday, Paul Kelly, 72, said it was still a good trip overall.

""We lost the fish of course,"" Kelly said. ""That was the worst part.""

Kelly said he was on a six-hour fishing trip with his good friend and a boat captain in Boca Grande Pass on Wednesday.

Near the end of the trip, both he and his friend had hooked sizable tarpon, he said.

Kelly said he was trying to work in a 150-pound tarpon when his shoe slipped and he was yanked into the water by the fish.

While he was underwater, Kelly said he felt something hit his leg. He didn't realize at the time it was a shark nibbling on it.

The captain pulled him to the boat with a fishing rod, and his buddy hoisted him into the boat by his belt.

Once he was in the boat, the captain told him a shark had bitten him, and that it appeared to be an eight to 10-foot bull shark, Kelly said.

That's when he noticed a gash around his left knee and calf, he said.

The men acted quickly, wrapping a belt around his left thigh to stop the bleeding as they raced to shore. Paramedics swarmed him, dressing his leg and securing a tourniquet. Kelly was airlifted to the trauma center.

Surgeons stitched him up, and he had surgery on a torn tendon in his knee the next day.

The Vietnam veteran said he barely felt pain through the whole incident or post surgery.

""You do the best with what you get,"" he said.

Doctors told him he should be able to leave the hospital in the next few days. He and his wife hope to return to Texas on Monday.

""They aren't that frequent to be honest with you,"" L'Connor said. ""It's something everybody is concerned with when they get into the water, but it's the first one I've seen in 10 years.""

It demonstrates the necessity of the trauma center, which serves trauma patients from the surrounding five counties and just celebrated its 25th year in business, L'Connor said.

There were 16 confirmed attacks in Florida last year, compared to 31 in 2017, according to ISAF data.

In Lee and Collier counties, 16 attacks have been confirmed by ISAF, which keeps records dating back to 1882.

In 2005, a young Austrian tourist was bitten on the right ankle in Lee County. Then in 2007, a shark bit a man off a Naples beach.

1100,"St. Lucie County sheriff's captain to be memorialized in Washington, D.C., before thousands of people","Almost 30 years ago, Charlie Scavuzzo was a Fort Pierce police officer when his best friend and fellow officer Danny Parrish got shot and killed in the line of duty.

Scavuzzo went to Washington, D.C., when Parrish’s name was added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, the country’s monument to officers who die in the line of duty.

“When they put Danny on the wall in Washington, Charlie went and he always talked about it and what a huge deal it was and how awesome and amazing it was,” said Scavuzzo’s widow, Tonya Scavuzzo.

Charlie Scavuzzo, 49, died in September 2017 when he was a captain with the St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office. His name is joining Parrish's on the wall.

He is one of 371 names added this year, and the only one from the Treasure Coast.

A candlelight vigil is scheduled Monday night on the National Mall. The names will be read. It's an event St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara expects 10,000 to 12,000 people will attend. A memorial at the U.S. Capitol is planned for Wednesday.

“It’s going to be hard. I think it’s going to be super emotional, but I can’t think of any better way than this for Charlie to be remembered on this kind of scale,” Tonya Scavuzzo said. “It’s a tremendous honor and he absolutely deserves it.”

Charlie Scavuzzo, who spent more than a decade as a narcotics investigator, died of a heart attack after a particularly difficult period on the job.

From 2009 through 2018, the top three causes of law enforcement officer deaths are gunshots, job-related illnesses and automobile crashes, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.

‘No matter what it took’

Sheriff’s Chief Deputy Garry Wilson said Scavuzzo worked around the clock in the days before his death, helping prepare for Hurricane Irma, and immersing himself in a homicide investigation.

Mascara and Tonya Scavuzzo, 49, said his work ethic was typical.

“He was going to finish the job no matter what it took,” Mascara said. “If it took working day and night for three or four days that’s what he always did. That’s just the kind of guy he was.”

Mascara remembered that on the day Scavuzzo died, he ran into him at a Dunkin’ Donuts. Mascara asked him how he was doing. He said Scavuzzo remarked he was exhausted, and Mascara encouraged him to sit down and relax. Scavuzzo wouldn’t have it, Mascara said, saying he had to get going because he thought he had a lead on the homicide case he was working.

Later that day he told some people in his unit he was going home because he felt exhausted and wanted to shower, freshen up and come back to work, Mascara said.

“He was coming back to work, but he never came back,” he said.

‘Poncho’

Mascara shared a story about Scavuzzo and his deep connections to the community.

Shortly after he was elected sheriff, he answered a call from a woman who wanted to remain anonymous, he said. She had important information for “Poncho.”

More: AK-47, drugs seized in St. Lucie County after deputies told about planned gang shooting, robbery

He said his secretary didn’t know Poncho, nor did Mascara. Mascara said he called the woman back and said he needed more information.

“She said, ‘You don’t know who Poncho is? Everybody in Fort Pierce knows who Poncho is. It’s Charlie Scavuzzo’,” Mascara said. “That was his street name.""

Everyone called him that and adored him and shared a tremendous amount of information with him because they knew they could trust him, Mascara said.

Charlie Scavuzzo was honored during the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office's Laying of the Wreath Service for National Law Enforcement Memorial Week on May 6 in Fort Pierce. That service honored the Sheriff's Office's eight heroes and one K9 that gave their lives while serving the community in St. Lucie County.

Mascara said he’s been to the ceremonies for three other deputies, including sheriff’s Sgt. Gary Morales, who was shot to death in a traffic stop in 2013 south of Edwards Road.

Charlie Scavuzzo was close with Morales, mentoring Morales while Morales was in the drug unit until he became a sergeant.

Tonya Scavuzzo said her husband didn’t attend the event in Washington when Morales’ name was added to the wall.

“He did CPR on Danny (Parrish) so when it happened to Gary I don’t think he could have went, honestly,” Tonya Scavuzzo said. “He was Gary’s boss and he thought of Gary as a son, so it was really tough on him.”

Mascara said he thought Scavuzzo may have been elected the next sheriff after Mascara retires. That, he said, is why he moved Scavuzzo to different areas in the agency so he could get experience.

Mascara said after he first was elected in 2000, he tried to speak to all sheriff’s employees to ask what was working and what needed to be changed or improved.

“One of the things that I heard quite often from the employees of the Sheriff’s Office was that Charlie Scavuzzo had to be returned back to the drug unit,” Mascara said.

Mascara said moving Scavuzzo from road patrol back to the drug unit was his first transfer.

'Deserves every bit of this’

Tonya Scavuzzo said several family members, including their three children, who range in age from 18 to 22, will be in Washington for the event.

“Being recognized locally is one thing and Charlie deserves it,"" Tonya Scavuzzo said. ""But nationally, where he’ll be there forever and everybody will know that he was a real hero, that’s what I want my kids to see.

“They already know that he was our superman, but he was more than that. He deserves every bit of this.”

National Memorial

1103,Teaching Scripture in public schools,"Florida's bill, which not only encourages but also requires public high schools to have an elective religion course, called for either ""objective study of religion"" or ""objective study of the Bible""; consideration of the bill was indefinitely postponed this month.

GLASGOW, Kentucky — Todd Steenbergen leads worship services in church sometimes, but today he was preaching in a different venue: the public-school classroom where he teaches.

""A lot of people will look at the Beatitudes and glean some wisdom from them,"" he told the roomful of students, pointing toward the famous blessings he had posted on the board, some of the best-known verses in the Bible. ""I want you to think about what kind of wisdom we can get from these today.""

While Steenbergen was urging students to draw lessons from the Bible here in southern Kentucky, students in Paducah - halfway across the state - were reading from the Gospels as well, in a classroom where they drew pictures of the cross and of Adam and Eve walking with dinosaurs, hanging them on the walls.

Scenes of Bible classes in public school could become increasingly common across the United States if other states follow Kentucky's lead in passing legislation that encourages high schools to teach the Bible.

Activists on the religious right, through their legislative effort Project Blitz, drafted a law that encourages Bible classes in public schools and persuaded at least 10 states legislatures to introduce versions of it this year. Georgia and Arkansas recently passed bills that are awaiting their governors' signatures.

Among the powerful fans of these public-school Bible classes: President Donald Trump.

""Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible,"" Trump tweeted in January. ""Starting to make a turn back? Great!""

Proponents of Bible instruction - such as Chuck Stetson, who publishes a textbook that he says is already in use in more than 600 public schools across the nation - are thrilled. ""We're not too far away from a tipping point. Instead of having to find a reason to teach the Bible in public schools academically, as part of a good education, you're going to have to find a reason not to do it,"" Stetson said. ""When the president of the United States gives us a shout-out, that's pretty crazy. . . . It's got the momentum now.""

Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a nonpartisan advocacy group organizing opposition to the state laws, takes a dark view of Project Blitz. The organization coordinated a statement signed by numerous religious groups that oppose Project Blitz's efforts - including the Union for Reform Judaism, the Hindu American Foundation, Muslim Advocates, the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the United Methodist Church.

""It's part of an effort to establish this sort of narrow Christian agenda as the norm for our country, the government-sanctioned and supported norm,"" said Rachel Laser, the president and chief executive of the Americans United group.

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled in School District of Abington Township v. Schempp that school-led Bible reading is an unconstitutional religious practice. But the court noted that teaching the Bible was allowed: ""Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment.""

Advocates of these classes view the Bible as a key component of a well-rounded education, key to understanding Western literature and American history. Such classes have long been offered by some public schools across the nation, sometimes taught by public-school employees with textbooks paid for by school budgets. Other times, schools have adopted ""released time"" rules that let students use part of their school day attending church-taught classes. West Virginia is now embroiled in a legal battle over such a policy.

Even those opposed to Bible classes in public schools often agree that religious literacy can be valuable if it is incorporated into world-religions or history classes.

But that is not what is called for in the state bills supported by Project Blitz, an effort of the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation, which describes its purpose as protecting ""the free exercise of traditional Judeo-Christian religious values and beliefs in the public square.""

Leaders of Project Blitz did not respond to inquiries from The Washington Post.

According to Americans United's analysis of the texts of state Bible-class bills, all but South Carolina's - which includes permission to teach alternatives to evolution, along with ""religions of the world"" - focus on the Christian Bible.

The Alabama, Georgia and West Virginia's bills say schools can teach the Old or New Testament, or both. Florida's bill, which not only encourages but also requires public high schools to have an elective religion course, called for either ""objective study of religion"" or ""objective study of the Bible""; consideration of the bill was indefinitely postponed this month.

Mississippi and North Dakota's bills failed this year. The rest are still up for consideration, according to state legislative trackers.

The model for many of these states is Kentucky, where state standards for elective Bible education became the law in 2017. The American Civil Liberties Union swiftly responded, issuing a letter that said it would closely monitor all school districts in the state. The organization flagged four school districts in Kentucky, warning that the materials used to teach the Bible in those schools suggested they were violating the Constitution and might lead to a future ACLU lawsuit.

Two of the four districts have since stopped offering a Bible class, saying student interest was low.

The remaining two are in Glasgow and Paducah. Both are in mostly rural counties where residents are vastly more likely to hold evangelical Christian beliefs than those of any other religious affiliation, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives. Very few residents of either county belong to a non-Christian religious group.

At Barren County High School in Glasgow, principal Brad Johnson refers to the school he graduated from and now leads as ""a prayerful school"" and ""a church-involved community."" On days when they are at school but students are not, teachers lead prayers over the loudspeaker. Johnson, also a Sunday-school teacher, says he sometimes drops in on Steenbergen's Bible class for ideas. He said parents are glad their children take the Bible class because they know Steenbergen is ""a Christian man"" who leads Baptist services outside school and Fellowship of Christian Athletes programs in school.

Students describe Steenbergen's Bible class as a chance to do something they enjoy during the school day - Cole Wilson, who took the class in a previous semester, likened reading the Bible in school to getting the chance to shoot hoops during gym class.

""I like studying the Bible anyway,"" agreed Mattie Coomer, who also took the class. ""As a Christian, I believe the Bible, it's a living book - if God is a living God, he's going to speak through his word every time you open up the Bible. It's more important than any other book I could be reading.""

Coomer said she just finished reading the Bible, from Genesis through Revelation, outside of school, and then started all over again. But that's not what happens in the classroom. In Steenbergen's Bible class, the students hardly read the Bible at all.

There is no classroom set of Bibles for every student, no encouragement to download a Bible app on their smartphones. He never assigns chapters or verses to read. Instead, he said, he summarizes biblical stories for them and focuses class time on highlighting connections between the Bible and modern life.

During one class this spring, he spent most of the hour-and-a-half period on a game in which students guessed which theme from the Gospel of Matthew or which blessing from the Beatitudes that Steenbergen meant to connect to when he played clips from country songs and Disney movies.

His consistent message throughout the game was that students should draw moral lessons from the Gospels.

"" 'Pure in spirit' is a good word to equate to humility, humble,"" he said. ""We see humility, a wise thing that could be applicable for us today. How many of us would like to be more humble about something?"" And later: ""Was there a time you helped provide some cheer for someone and it made you aware how good it was? . . . We can use wisdom and apply it in new ways today and help people be comforted.""

That was the sort of teaching that concerned ACLU lawyers, who flagged Steenbergen's class as a potential lawsuit waiting to happen.

""We urge you to put in place mechanisms for monitoring these courses as they are implemented to ensure that they do not run afoul of the students' and parents' constitutional rights,"" the ACLU wrote to the Kentucky Department of Education.

Steenbergen, one of four members of the committee that wrote the statewide standards for public-school Bible education, said he thinks he is toeing a constitutionally permissible line - in an unusual way. His solution is simply leaving out parts of the Bible.

In the Beatitudes, he omits phrases. "" 'For theirs is the kingdom of heaven,' for example - I don't want to go that deep,"" he said. ""It relates to some discussions that we don't want to get to in the classroom. I'm just saying the themes, how sometimes those themes still show up today and are influences for some people.""

He skips much of Paul's letters for the same reason: ""So much of it is doctrinal that I don't feel that I should cross the line to promote certain items.""

At McCracken County High in Paducah, Ellen Powless takes a different approach in teaching her Bible class.

All students have a Bible in print as well as a Bible app on their phones or school-issued laptops. Students read chapters for homework and spend much of their class time going line by line through the text together.

Powless paces the room, steering her students through question after question about the words of Scripture.

""Tell me about Isaac. What do we know about Isaac?"" she said one morning this semester.

Silence. ""That's OK,"" said Powless, who has taught English for 21 years in the school she also grew up in. ""Let's go to the text - Genesis 25.""

"" 'Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife, because she was barren,' "" she read. ""Hmm, what other character have we seen that's dealt with barrenness?""

In class, she calls biblical figures ""characters"" and always refers to ""their god,"" not to ""God.""

When she began the Exodus story, she briefly noted that historical evidence does not necessarily bear out that any mass exodus of Jewish slaves from Egypt ever happened, though she said she did not have time to teach about that evidence.

Her students are already familiar with the Bible - almost all of them participate in religious extracurriculars such as prayer groups and Fellowship of Christian Athletes. On the day that Powless talked about Exodus, 50 McCracken County students had just embarked on a school-sponsored trip to El Salvador, run in conjunction with a Christian group, Starfish Orphan Ministry. On a trip blog, students described writing ""Jesus loves you"" in the sand and telling people ""God bless you"" as they handed them ham sandwiches.

Maggie Dowdy said she picked this course because she thought it would be easy. After all, she already knew the Bible from church.

When the class started with the very first Bible story - the story of creation - she was glad she had chosen it. Here at last was the story of human origins that she believed in - not the facts of evolution that she had been taught in her high school science class.

""When I started learning about [evolution], I thought: 'That's not true. Here's what I believe,' "" Dowdy said. ""I just kind of push it aside now. I know what I believe in. It's just something the teachers have to teach us, but, no, I believe in creation.""

Other students echoed her. ""We've always in science learned that perspective, evolution and the big bang,"" Morgan Guess said. ""This is the class that allows us the other perspective.""

Only Katie King, 17, expressed doubts about the Bible in a discussion one morning. ""I took this class to see for myself if this is what I wanted to follow and believe,"" she told classmates. ""My parents are so religious. They push it a lot.""

""The Bible per se, some things I'm just like - I don't know,"" said King, who acknowledged that she is often an outlier among her peers because she supports abortion rights and likes reading New York Times articles about politics. ""Like one thing - I don't get that people who are good people, genuinely good, nice people, have good intentions, but because they don't believe in God, they're doomed to hell. I can't accept that. I cannot accept that.""

She hopes to find faith, or to understand her lack of it, she said. But she is no longer sure that her Bible class can offer her an answer.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190509/teaching-scripture-in-public-schools?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T09:50:00Z,Panama City News Herald,Florida Man,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401

“It is a very fair contract,” said Al Boettjer, union representative for Coastal Florida Police Benevolent Association, which serves the supervisors.

Additional terms of the contract include a housing allowance of $3,000 per year, about $250 per month, for all officers who live in the city and have up to 10 years of service and the monthly stipend for K-9 officers will increase from $320 to $450.

The housing allowance is needed to help the city recruit and retain officers and to help fight crime, Mayor Linda Hudson said.

“It helps with community policing because the officers are living in the city and the neighborhoods and people would get to know them outside of work,” Hudson said. “And if there is some sort of criminal activity occurring, the community would be more comfortable sharing that information with our police officers because they know them.”

The Police Department should not rely on higher salaries and housing allowances to fight crime but use more of its budget for technology equipment, such as improving forensics and purchasing surveillance cameras to help fight crime, City Commissioner Reggie Sessions said.

“I support paying our officers more but there is a lot of technology out there, like ShotSpotter and putting surveillance cameras in high crime areas to help find out who is responsible for these shootings, that the city can be doing.""

ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system used by police departments to help pinpoint the exact location of gunfire.

1110,"Boy, 11, charged with arson in connection with Sebastian boat, trailer fires","CLOSE Indian River County fire crews responded after an explosion was reported near U.S. 1 in Sebastian on Friday, March 15, 2019. A boat had caught fire. Eric Rogers, Florida Today

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — An 11-year-old boy faces two felony counts of arson after deputies said he and a friend set fire to a trailer and boat on a lot behind a Sebastian neighborhood.

The boat fire, reported at the end of Essex Lane off Schumman Drive, caused a small explosion March 15 when flames caught on 50 gallons of fuel left aboard, sending up thick plumes of smoke to the surrounding area.

No injuries were reported in that blaze, nor when a small metal trailer on the same lot burned to the ground a month earlier.

More: Cause of Sebastian boat fire, explosion may remain mystery

Investigators with the Bureau of Fire, Arson and Explosives Investigations determined the fires were intentionally set and interviewed the boy after he was named in an anonymous tip, the warrant said.

The boy denied starting the fires but was named by two friends, who told police he had caused the boat fire by torching the seat cushions with a lighter and used lantern fuel and matches to burn the trailer.

He was arrested Friday and taken to the Department of Juvenile Justice in Fort Pierce.

Investigators also implicated one of the friends, who was present for or participated in starting the fires, according to the warrant. Sebastian police Lt. Timothy Wood said the state attorney's office is determining whether charges will be filed.

The total value of the burned property was about $7,000, investigators said.

Indian River County Fire officials originally told reporters no actions would be taken after the boat fire, despite suspicions of arson, because the boat had little or no monetary value.

1111,Why did pilot request runway change before crash landing at NAS Jax?,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - As a Boeing 737 jet remains in shallow water at the end of a Naval Air Station Jacksonville's runway after crashing through the seawall and into the river Friday night, we're learning more about the events that led up to the crash landing.

The National Transportation Safety Administration Board had said pilots of the transport flight from Guantanamo Bay requested a last-minute change to the runway where they would be landing during heavy weather.

A recording of air traffic radio traffic captured the exchange with the pilot of the Air Florida International fight, designated Biscayne 293.

Controller: ""Biscayne 293, just talked to Navy JAX tower. He said both runways look pretty bad, pretty socked in, showing moderate to heavy precipitation east and west of the airport. Do you want to try RNAV 28?""

Pilot: ""Looks better. And when I get closer, I’ll check how it is.""

LISTEN: Air traffic control exchanges as Air Miami flight enters Jacksonville airspace

The 9,000-foot-long runway where the chartered jet eventually landed was essentially limited to 7,800 feet since there was a wire barrier set up to recover Navy aircraft in instances they couldn't land on a carrier during training, said Bruce Landsberg, vice chairman of the NTSB.

""We don't know what they were thinking or why they made that choice,"" Landsberg said at a news conference. ""That will be one of the things we look to find out.""

Landsberg said the plane's maintenance logs showed a left-hand thrust reverser that was inoperative. Thrust reversers are used to divert thrust from the engine, but they typically aren't used in calculating a plane's performance, Landsberg said.

Reverse thrust can be used to help an aircraft come to a stop.

Capt. Wayne Ziskal, a 50-year veteran pilot who teaches at Jacksonville University’s School of Aviation said the plane came in for a landing during moderate to heavy rain, poor visibility and a tailwind of nearly 20 mph. Planes try to land against the wind, not with the wind behind it.

Ziskal estimated the crew tried to land with a ground speed of more than 200 mph -- dangerous given the conditions.

""80% of accidents have a human factors component to them,"" Ziskal said. ""When we start talking about human factors, we start talking about decision-making, critical thinking -- all the things that go into why you made the decision and why you acted the way that you did.""

Ziskal said the pilots always have the option to “go around"" -- pull out of a landing and circle back. If conditions are still bad, they can choose to land at another airport.

Investigators have retrieved the flight data recorder, but the NTSB investigators said they hope a cockpit voice recorder helps them answer that question. They have been unable to recover it from the tail of the plane because it is still underwater.

Investigators also asked anyone who shot video of the plane landing to share it with the NTSB.

There were no serious injuries on the flight from a military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, although almost two dozen of the 143 passengers and crew members sought medical attention for minor injuries and three pets died when the cargo hold in the belly of the plane went under water.

Capt. Michael Connor, the base's commanding officer, said all passengers had left the base Sunday on their way to their scheduled destinations.

Some aircraft will be allowed to depart the base and be relocated so that pilots can continue with their training, but air traffic in and out of Naval Air Station Jacksonville is effectively closed until the plane is removed from the river, Connor said.

The NTSB investigators are still deciding when and how to relocate the plane off the base, which would require the use of a barge.

""How the aircraft is positioned now certainly gives you limitations on a good thorough assessment,"" said NTSB investigator John Lovell. ""We are not aware of the extent of the damage under the waterline because it can't be seen.""

All fuel needs to be removed before the plane can be moved, and that effort was complicated by the aircraft being partially submerged in the river, as well as stormy weather on Sunday, Landsberg said.

Officials said they didn't know how many gallons of fuel have spilled into the river, but engineers were using booms to contain the fuel and skimmers to vacuum up contaminants.

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection Agency is urging anyone who sees an oil slick or distressed wildlife to call its emergency hotline number: 800-320-0519.

Divers on Sunday were sent into the plane's cargo area to search and remove a handful of pets that had been unable to be rescued because of safety concerns. The investigators didn't say outright whether the animals were dead, but the pets would have been submerged for almost two days.

Cellphone video from passenger Darwing Silva captured the immediate, uncertain moments after the chartered jet landed.

A passenger shouted ""Watch out! Watch out!"" as other passengers and crew members cautiously walked out on a wing of the plane. Another passenger shouted, ""Baby coming through!"" and a man can be seen holding an infant in his arms as he walks along with the other passengers in yellow life jackets getting drenched by rain.

Silva said those passengers initially were told Friday the aircraft might not be fit for takeoff. Then the flight was cleared to leave Cuba, but with the warning there would be no air conditioning.

Even though the plane was hot, there were no other problems during the flight from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Silva said.

The landing at Naval Air Station Jacksonville seemed normal at first, but then the plane didn't stop on the runway. There was a loud bang, he hit his head on the ceiling, and the jet ended up in the water, Silva said.

He looked down and his ankles were in water, he said, and he heard someone yell, ""Fuel!""

Silva said he helped usher people out an emergency door onto a wing.

On Sunday, Miami Air International, which operated the aircraft, notified passengers that their overhead luggage from the plane was available for pickup. The airline said passengers would be contacted directly once their checked bags were retrieved.

Also Sunday, a small, one-propeller seaplane crashed into the St. Johns River in Jacksonville. The pilot, who was the only person on board and wasn't injured, was rescued by a kayaker, according to the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department.

1113,"Hills, hawks and animals on the path to the Tails & Trails half-marathon","Buy Photo Herb Wills, running column. (Photo: Democrat files)

On the east side of Tallahassee, Tom Brown Park, Lafayette Heritage Park, and the Alford Greenway are connected by dozens if not hundreds of miles of trails. Charlie Johnson covered 13.1 miles on those trails in 1:25:32 to win the half-marathon at the 18th annual Tails & Trails on Saturday morning, May 4. Amanda Sava was the first woman in the race, defending her 2018 title in the half marathon with a 1:38:43 and placing seventh overall.

The Animal Shelter Foundation has always hosted the event, starting in 2002 with a 5K race, adding a 10K in 2006 and the half marathon in 2015. Two days before the 2019 Tails & Trails, the longest run was in peril.

“I got a call from the city on Thursday at 4:30,” said Tom Perkins. “There was a hawk attacking people in Lafayette Heritage Park. We were going to have to cancel the race or re-route it.”

It turned out that a very minor change of course satisfied the hawk’s territorial instincts, and the half-marathon started from the Animal Shelter as scheduled at 7:45 a.m., with Jeff Nielsen guiding the runners on the lead bicycle. After the first minute of running, Charlie Johnson was already well ahead of the field. No one, athlete or irate bird, challenged Johnson for the rest of the race.

“I was hoping for a hawk attack,” said Johnson. “Anything to have some excitement out there. It helped to have Jeff Nielsen out there on the bicycle, telling me, ‘OK, there’s a big hill coming up.’”

There are numerous hills on the Tails & Trails half marathon course, which takes the runners in and out of the Lake Lafayette basin before finishing back at the Animal Shelter, atop the ridge that Easterwood Drive runs along. Amanda Sava also noticed those hills.

It was tough!” said Sava. “I ran a lot faster this year. I think I’m in better shape, but I ran a triathlon last week and my legs are still recovering. I’m happy with my race, though. I’ll probably take a little break after this.”

Behind Johnson’s winning 1:25:32, Brad Busboom took second in 1:32:31 and Andrew Theodore third in 1:36:47. Jack McDermott was the first master runner in the half marathon, placing fourth overall in 1:36:47.

Melissa Thompson finished runner-up to Sava in the women's standings, placing sixteenth overall in 1:52:26. Courtney Mason was the third woman and seventeenth overall in 1:53:19. Laura Reina was the first woman master and fifth female finisher, twentieth overall in 1:55:11.

The Tails & Trails 10K started at 8:30, when the fastest half marathon runners were still exploring the Alford Greenway. Pensacola, Florida master runner Jennifer McGranahan was not only the first woman in the race, she was also the overall winner. McGranahan grabbed the lead right after the start, shadowed by Sean Landeta of Thomasville, Georgia. Landeta hung on for the first half of the race, but McGranahan got away after the leaders had turned around for the return trip to the Animal Shelter. 50 meters ahead by the six-kilometer mark, McGranahan finished with a lead of nearly 200 meters and a winning time of 46:08.

“That was fun!” said McGranahan. “I’ll be out there next year. I liked everything that went into this race; the trails, the family discount, the animals. It’s a nice way to find good homes for some animals.”

McGranahan has deep running roots in Pensacola, having raced cross-country and track for Pensacola High before going on to compete for the University of Florida. Currently, she’s working on a degree in physical therapy at Florida A&M University.

“I usually run the Fiesta of Five Flags 10K in Pensacola, and I could have driven back for that,” said McGranahan. “But I thought, ‘No!’ I love Tom Brown Park and the trails.”

Sean Landeta was the first man in the race, coming in second overall in 46:57. Paul Guyas was the first male master, third overall in 47:12. Master runner Tim Unger was third on the men's side and fifth overall in 48:40.

Tim Unger is Lilli Unger’s father, and Lilli Unger was second in the women’s standings.The Leon High cross-country runner placed fourth overall in 47:54. Alyssa Terry finished third in the women's division and seventh overall in 50:04.

The Tails & Trails 5K started at the same time as the 10K. Kurt Dietrich took the early lead in the 3.1-mile race. Having won the 5K in 2017 and 2018, Dietrich was going for a third straight title, but Connor Edwards denied him that. Edwards, an eighth-grader at Swift Creek Middle School, overtook Dietrich then went on to win the race in 19:44. Dietrich was second in 20:00, and Daniel Wurgler third in 20:14. Aaron Guyer was the top master runner in the 5K, placing seventh overall in 21:06.

In the 2015 Tails & Trails 10K Brittney Barnes had been the first woman. In the 2016 Tails & Trails 5K Barnes had been the first woman. In the 2019 5K she was again the first woman, placing ninth overall in 21:38. Amelia Bryant was second to Barnes, placing thirteenth overall in 25:10. Twelve-year-old Liliana Lewis edged Paula O'Neill for the third spot in the women's standings, 25:47 to 25:49. The two were sixteenth and seventeenth overall. O'Neill was the first woman master in the race.

643 athletes crossed the finish line at the 2019 Tails & Trails, with 125 completing the half marathon, 148 the 10K, 302 the 5K, and 68 the one-mile fun run. Gulf Winds Track Club of Tallahassee chip-timed each of the four races.

1114,Woman found with alleged arcade-scamming device in St. Lucie County,"CLOSE If you see a crime being committed, leave anonymous tips with Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers. GINNY BEAGAN/TCPALM April 2019 Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

ST. LUCIE COUNTY — A woman was arrested after St. Lucie County Sheriff’s investigators said they found her with an electronic device that apparently helped her scam arcade machines out of money, according to an affidavit.

Karolyn Griffith, 30, of Sanford, was arrested May 3 on charges related to grand theft, fraud and giving false information to a law enforcement officer.

Deputies about 3:15 a.m. went to the Gold Rush arcade in the 6600 block of South U.S. 1 and spoke to Griffith, who investigators say tried to hide “a black electronic box with a red button and an antenna,” an affidavit states.

An employee said Griffith was winning too much money and it didn’t make sense.

The employee said Griffith and two others were there at the time, with “all acting like they did not know each other.” Griffith and a man occasionally changed between machines.

Investigators tested the device that Griffith had. A deputy switched on the device and was able to add credits to one of the machines.

The amount of money missing from the two machines totaled nearly $2,800.

Griffith was taken to the St. Lucie County jail, but it could not be determined Monday whether she had been released on bail.

1115,Jeb Bush's education plan comes full circle | Guestview,"It was appropriate that legislators invited former Gov. Jeb Bush to visit the House this week as the big tuition-voucher bill was given final approval.

It was Bush who, a little more than 20 years ago, began Florida’s education evolution – some would call it a revolution — culminating in the near party-line vote of 76-39 for the package that will allow state tax money to be used for families to send their kids to private schools. The first time he ran for governor, Bush visited public schools all over the state in 1994 and said he was going to work for major, fundamental change in education.

Whatever else you might think of Bush, he was an idea man. He seemed to have little patience with “but we’ve always done it this way.”



He lost that year but won four years later. Republicans controlled both chambers of the Legislature by then, and Bush won legislative approval of his initial voucher plan – dubbed the “opportunity scholarship program” – only to have it stricken by the Florida Supreme Court.

Former Governor Jeb Bush is introduced on the floor of the House of Representatives just before the body voted to approve a Senate bill to allow more students to use taxpayer-funded vouchers to attend private schools. (Photo: Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat)

A few important things have changed since then, but the fundamentals remain the same. Republicans call it “choice” – an idea Democrats like in another context, but not regarding schools – and Democrats call it wholesale robbery of the public schools. A smattering of Democrats voted for the voucher bill in the House, but the idea of providing $130 million in tax money to help low- and moderate-income families pay tuition was too much for most of their party.

That’s hardly surprising. The Florida Education Association, the state’s big teacher union, has the most sought-after political endorsement in Democratic primaries. The National Rifle Association’s approach to gun control is a model of open-minded moderation and willingness to hear both sides, compared to the FEA’s attitude toward tuition vouchers.

Parents seem to like them, though. There’s a waiting list of more than 13,000 kids who’d like to switch schools under the existing voucher program, which is funded through corporate tax credits rather than direct support from the treasury. The “Family Empowerment Scholarship Program,” as the just-passed bill is titled, raises the eligibility ceiling from $66,950 to $77,250 for a family of four seeking tuition assistance.

The Florida Supreme Court will probably like it better, too. No justices who voted on the 5-2 ruling striking down Bush’s “opportunity scholarship plan” in 2006 are still on the bench. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who will undoubtedly sign the new bill (SB 7070), appointed three new justices early this year, replacing three who’d voted against the Bush plan (among other conservative causes over the years).

The political outcome has been inevitable since last November. If Democrat Andrew Gillum had beaten DeSantis, he’d have appointed different Supreme Court justices. He’d also veto the vouchers, if the GOP-run Legislature even bothered passing the bill.

There’s a good argument that competition always improves efficiency and outcomes, even in schools. That would be valid, if the competition was fair – if private schools were held to the same standards as public schools. If they were graded A through F like public schools. If they had to take everybody, even the most troubled kids, like the public schools.

Private schools can also do a lousy job. The Orlando Sentinel did a series in 2017, “Schools Without Rules,” documenting how some private academies hired teachers without college degrees – even with criminal records – and falsified health and safety inspections. The privateers exist primarily to make money, while the public schools exist to survive annual mandates and meddling from Tallahassee.

If the kids get an education in there somehow, that’s nice too.

Some time this month, DeSantis ought to invite Bush back to the Capitol for the formal signing of the new voucher law, or take the bill down to Miami and set up a ceremony somewhere historically significant to the governor who started it all. Then he could give him the pen.

(WFLA) - Marvel fans, you might want to start looking for cheap flights to California.

Disney's California Adventure has revealed the first details of its brand new Marvel-themed expansion.

“The Guardians of the Galaxy will be joined by Spider-Man and the Avengers in what will become a completely immersive Super Hero universe, furthering the evolution of Disney California Adventure park,” the company said in its official parks' blog.

The new land will center around the existing Guardians of the Galaxy ride– Mission: BREAKOUT! and move into the adjacent space that is currently occupied by “a bug’s land.” “It’s Tough to Be a Bug,” which closed on March 19.

Expansion plans are also underway at Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. They will all be connected, the blog explained.

""These three new areas will champion the next generation of Super Heroes.""

1120,"April 2007, News-Press archive; Shark bites man near Naples hotel","A bull shark was blamed for an April 2007 attack on a man in Collier County. (Photo: News-Press archive)

This story was originally published in The News-Press May 7, 2007

In the first shark attack since April 2006, a man was bitten Tuesday off a Naples beach.

Hans Pruss was swimming about 100 yards offshore from the Edgewater Beach Hotel when he felt something bump him on the left leg.

He swam to shore and saw a circular bite beginning just above the left knee and extending to mid-thigh.

""He was not in critical condition,"" hotel spokeswoman Courtney Giammaria said. ""After the incident, he swam to shore, and we made a call to emergency services.""

Emergency personal said the bite was probably caused by a 6- to 8-foot shark.

Pruss was taken to Naples Community Hospital.

A single shark incident doesn't mean Southwest Florida will see a ""Jaws""-like spate of shark attacks, said Bob Hueter, director of Mote Marine Laboratory's Center for Shark Research.

""If you look at the statistics, you'll see that shark attacks are rare in Florida and exceedingly rare in Collier and Lee counties,"" he said. ""It's such a statistical fluke that there's no reason to expect it will happen again any time soon.""

Original reports said the animal was a bull shark.

""I'd caution everybody that we don't know that it was a bull shark -- it sounds like speculation,"" Hueter said. ""It could have been a bull, blacktip or lemon.""

Although the incident is technically a shark attack, it was not a case of a shark seeking humans to eat.

""This is starting to look like the kind of shark bite when a shark sees something in the water and checks it out to see if it's suitable prey,"" Hueter said. ""It takes one bite, realizes it's the wrong thing and is gone. Unfortunately, it's going to cause a nasty wound.""

This is the eighth confirmed unprovoked shark attack in Collier County since 1882, the most recent in April 2006.

There have been five unprovoked shark attacks in Lee County in that same time period, and no shark attack in either Lee or Collier county has been fatal.

The most recent shark attack in Lee County was July 1, 2005, when a young Austrian tourist was bitten on the right ankle.

Florida leads the nation in shark attacks with 544 -- 13 have been fatal.

In recent years, most shark incidents have involved surfers: Of the 167 people bitten by sharks during the 1990s in Florida, 113 were surfers.

Lee County can be a particularly sharky place at this time of year: Mote scientists have documented that at least 13 shark species, including bulls, blacktips, lemons and great hammerheads, use the Charlotte Harbor system as a nursery area during the summer.

At this time of year, blacktip, bull, hammerhead, blacknose and lemon sharks are migrating along the Southwest Florida coast.

Despite the numbers of sharks in the area, people shouldn't be afraid to go in the water, Hueter said.

""On a practical level: Be cautious,"" Hueter said. ""Follow the basic guidelines when swimming in the ocean. Swim where lifeguards are at the beaches. Don't panic and think something is going on out there.""

Reducing risk of shark attack

•Always stay in groups since sharks are more likely to attack a solitary individual.

•Do not wander too far from shore -- this isolates an individual and places one far away from assistance.

•Avoid being in the water during darkness or twilight hours when sharks are most active and have a competitive sensory advantage.

•Do not enter the water if bleeding from an open wound or if menstruating -- a shark's olfactory ability is acute.

•Wearing shiny jewelry is discouraged because the reflected light resembles the sheen of fish scales.

•Avoid waters with known effluents or sewage and those used by sport or commercial fisherman, especially if there are signs of bait fishes or feeding activity. Diving seabirds are good indicators of such action.

•Sightings of porpoises do not indicate the absence of sharks -- both often eat the same food items.

•Use extra caution when waters are murky and avoid uneven tanning and bright colored clothing -- sharks see contrast particularly well.

•Refrain from excess splashing and do not allow pets in the water because of their erratic movements.

•Exercise caution when occupying the area between sandbars or near steep dropoffs -- these are favorite hangouts for sharks.

•Do not enter the water if sharks are known to be present, and evacuate the water if sharks are seen while there. And, of course, do not harass a shark if you see one!

1133,Navy planes use NAS Jacksonville runway while recovery efforts continue,"<p>As a Boeing 737 jet remains in shallow water at the end of a Naval Air Station Jacksonville's runway after crashing through the seawall and into the river Friday night, Navy aircraft resumed taking off from runway 10-2-8.</p>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Administration Board said Sunday pilots of the transport flight from Guantanamo Bay requested a last-minute change to the runway where they would be anding during heavy weather.</p>

<p>The 9,000-foot-long runway where the chartered jet landed was essentially limited to 7,800 feet since there was a wire barrier set up to recover Navy aircraft in instances they couldn't land on a carrier during training, said Bruce Landsberg, vice chairman of the NTSB.</p>

<p>""We don't know what they were thinking or why they made that choice,"" Landsberg said at a news conference. ""That will be one of the things we look to find out.""</p>

<p>Landsberg didn't elaborate on the significance of the runway change but said it would be a focus of investigation.</p>

<p>NTSB investigators said they hope a cockpit voice recorder helps them answer that question, but they have been unable to recover it from the tail of the plane because it is still underwater. Investigators have retrieved the flight data recorder.</p>

<p>Landsberg said the plane recently had been in maintenance, and logs showed a left-hand thrust reverser that was inoperative. Thrust reversers are used to divert thrust from the engine, but they typically aren't used in calculating a plane's performance, Landsberg said.</p>

<p>According to a Purdue University College of Engineering description, reverse thrust can be used to help an aircraft come to a stop.</p>

<p>""We will be looking very carefully at the maintenance of the aircraft in the several weeks prior,"" Landsberg said.</p>

<p>Investigators are also asking anyone who shot video of the plane landing to share it with the NTSB.</p>

<p>There were no serious injuries on the flight from a military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, although almost two dozen of the 143 passengers and crew members sought medical attention for minor injuries.</p>

<p>Capt. Michael Connor, the base's commanding officer, said all passengers had left the base Sunday on their way to their scheduled destinations.</p>

<p>Some aircraft will be allowed to depart the base and be relocated so that pilots can continue with their training, but Naval Air Station Jacksonville will essentially be closed until the plane is removed from the river, Connor said.</p>

<p>The NTSB investigators are still deciding when and how to relocate the plane off the base, which would require the use of a barge.</p>

<p>""How the aircraft is positioned now certainly gives you limitations on a good thorough assessment,"" said NTSB investigator John Lovell. ""We are not aware of the extent of the damage under the waterline because it can't be seen.""</p>

<p>All fuel needs to be removed before the plane can be moved, and that effort was complicated by the aircraft being partially submerged in the river, as well as stormy weather on Sunday, Landsberg said.</p>

<p>Officials said they didn't know how many gallons of fuel have spilled into the river, but engineers were using booms to contain the fuel and skimmers to vacuum up contaminants.</p>

<p>The Florida Department of Environmental Protection Agency is urging anyone who sees an oil slick or distressed wildlife to call its emergency hotline number: 800-320-0519.  </p>

<p>Divers on Sunday were sent into the plane's cargo area to search and remove a handful of pets that had been unable to be rescued because of safety concerns. The investigators didn't say outright whether the animals were dead, but the pets would have been submerged for almost two days.</p>

<p>Cellphone video from passenger Darwing Silva captured the immediate, uncertain moments after the chartered jet landed.</p>

<p>A passenger shouted ""Watch out! Watch out!"" as other passengers and crew members cautiously walked out on a wing of the plane. Another passenger shouted, ""Baby coming through!"" and a man can be seen holding an infant in his arms as he walks along the other passengers in yellow life jackets getting drenched by rain.</p>

<p>Silva said that passengers initially were told Friday the aircraft might not be fit for takeoff. Then the flight was cleared to leave Cuba, but with the warning there would be no air conditioning.</p>

<p>Even though the plane was hot, there were no other problems during the flight from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Silva said.</p>

<p>The landing at Naval Air Station Jacksonville seemed normal at first, but then the plane didn't stop on the runway. There was a loud bang, he hit his head on the ceiling, and the jet ended up in the water, Silva said.</p>

<p>He looked down and his ankles were in water, he said, and he heard someone yell, ""Fuel!""</p>

<p>Silva said he helped usher people out an emergency door onto a wing.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Miami Air International, which operated the aircraft, notified passengers that their overhead luggage from the plane was available for pickup. The airline said passengers would be contacted directly once their checked bags were retrieved.</p>

<p>Also Sunday, a small, one-propeller seaplane crashed into the St. Johns River in Jacksonville. The pilot, who was the only person on board and wasn't injured, was rescued by a kayaker, according to the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department.</p>",https://www.news4jax.com/news/navy-planes-use-nas-jacksonville-runway-10-while-recovery-efforts-continue,2019-05-06T16:39:35Z,WJXT,Florida Man,"4 Broadcast Pl, Jacksonville, FL 32207, USA",FL,32207

Voters decide

Speaking as an independent, I have prepared a statement for the Democratic Party – We have reviewed the redacted Mueller report.

First and foremost, we are appalled at the extent to which the Russians interfered with the 2016 election and vow to not let this happen again. Although we take issue with much of the White House’s behavior on this (including ostensibly welcoming and encouraging Russian interference), we are relieved that the president has not been found guilty of conspiring with the Russians. We vehemently disagree with the summary of William Barr concerning obstruction of justice. Mueller has laid out multiple examples of Trump's attempts to obstruct.

Nonetheless, we have determined it is in the best interest of the citizens of our country for Congress not to pursue further investigation of this matter or impeachment. The divisive state of our nation has reached a critical point and further pursuit would push the polarization to the breaking point.

We are therefore focusing on any bipartisan legislation that can yet be accomplished during the current administration, along with building a positive platform for the 2020 election where we plan a resounding victory. We will ultimately let the voters decide about this matter.

About us

What subjects are you talking about at the kitchen table? I think we all have favorite subjects based on age, position in life, kids, grandkids, health, local issues, traffic, etc. When media talks about kitchen table subjects, they focus on what drives readership and viewership. White nationalism? Impeachment? Transgenders in the military? $15 minimum wage? Spoiled wealthy kids paying / bribing into prestigious schools?

We may laugh at Bernie and Joe, we may cringe at AOC and Adam Schiff and we do care about our country. What we do care about is a safe and secure country, we depend on our politicians to do their jobs and we most certainly want the best for our kids.

I support term limits and campaign finance but the corruption is just redefined. When we hold leaders responsible things will change. And that goes for all of our local politicians and civic leaders. it is not about you but about us.

How sad

When the abused women banded together to fight this epidemic of men taking advantage (sexually, etc.) of women, my first reaction was great.

Then, it dawned on me. Yes, it gave women their much-needed ""voice"" but,it also gave a weapon of unfairly accusing an innocent ""hug.""

The most obvious was a political advocate of Bernie Sanders, who came forward on national television to accuse Joe Biden of ""invading her space."" She admitted her Sanders affiliation and also did not accuse Mr. Biden of any sexual advances, but did succeed to dirty the water.

For shame to use Biden as a scapegoat for political lies.

I have lived a long time (87 years) and in my younger years I personally operated a restaurant in New York City; most of my patrons were attorneys and successful business men with politicians as well. I was hugged by the vast majority of my customers.

How sad that a warm loving man such as Joe Biden could even being chastised by a political worker. Shame on you, for not only Biden, but for the women who were abused against their will and now have a voice.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s health minister is proposing fines for parents of school-age children who haven’t been vaccinated for measles amid concern that the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease could make a comeback.

In an interview published Sunday with German weekly Bild am Sonntag, minister Jens Spahn said parents who can’t prove their children have been vaccinated for measles should have to pay up to 2,500 euros ($2,790).

The minister also proposed that children without measles vaccinations be banned from going to daycare facilities, to protect others who are too young or medically unable to receive a measles immunization.

Compulsory medical procedures, including vaccinations, are a politically sensitive issue in Germany and it’s unclear whether Spahn’s proposal, which has yet to be discussed by Cabinet, will be implemented.

But worries that a disease once thought under control could re-emerge as a major threat has experts calling for vaccinations to be stepped up. The head of the German Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, on Sunday welcomed Spahn’s proposal, telling Germany’s RND media group that it was “an important step at the right time.”

Germany had 203 reported cases of measles in the first 10 weeks of 2019, more than twice as many as in the same period last year but fewer than in 2017. Neighboring Switzerland last week reported two adult deaths from measles this year: one in an unvaccinated man of about 30 and another in a man of about 70 whose immune system had been compromised by cancer.

Experts generally say if more than 95% of the population is properly immunized, measles cannot spread easily and is effectively contained. But pockets of unvaccinated children or adults can cause flare-ups, as has recently been the case in the United States , which has over 700 cases this year in an outbreak that has not been halted.

According to the World Health Organization, Europe as a whole had 82,596 cases of measles last year and 72 measles deaths. Most of those infections — 53,218 — were recorded in Ukraine, where an armed conflict with separatists is hurting medical care in its eastern regions.

Popular European tourist destinations such as France and Italy had more than 2,400 measles cases each from March 2018 to February 2019, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, an EU agency. Greece had more than 1,400 measles cases and Britain reported over 900 during that time.",https://www.wfla.com/national/germany-threatens-to-fine-parents-who-don-t-get-their-children-vaccinated-against-measles/1981214583,2019-05-05T21:17:11Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1141,Passenger: 'I felt like we were probably not going to have good ending',"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Texas man and his father returning from a work trip to Guantanamo Bay shared a frightening experience when a chartered Miami Air 737 they were on made a hard landing at NAS Jacksonville and skidded into the St. Johns River.

Tyler Hall said he didn’t hear anything from the pilot but everyone could clearly tell something was wrong because the plane wasn’t slowing down on the runway. He braced himself.

""When we were coming in, it felt like we were coming a little fast and then hit the runway. It felt like we skipped, and it was like we never slowed down. We continued going and we were running out of runway,"" Hall said. ""When we got close to the end, I felt like we were probably not going to have a good ending.""

Once the plane landed in the St. Johns River, Hall said water came through the roof of the cabin and he was soaked.

Despite the chaos, he said everyone on the plane put their fears aside to make sure all got off safely.

Hall then noticed paramedics rushing through the aisle to help a man who was injured.

""There was a bunch of people in the aisle. They said, 'Hey there’s a medic coming through.' They obliged, let the medic and it turns out the (wounded) guy was actually my father.""

Once he got off the plane, Hall checked on his father.

""Once we got everybody out, I poked my head back in and just asked and said, 'Hey, there was an older gentleman that was sitting right there in 13F, and I was just checking to see if he was alright,'"" Hall said. ""Someone said, 'Yeah, he’s helping get people off.'""

Hall said his father had a laceration on his forehead but he is home and doing well. Hall made it back home to his pregnant wife and son in Texas one day late, but safe and full of appreciation for his fellow passengers.

He said a plane full of strangers instantly became a team with a mission: to make sure everyone got off safely.

“What could have been a tragedy turned out to be an absolute coming together of a bunch of fine folk,"" Hall said. He feels blessed to have been surrounded by a selfless group of people who helped him get back home to his family.

1142,"2014 archive: Plenty of sharks, but few attacks; There's been no local fatalities in 131 years","Bull shark

Editor's note: This story was originally published in The News-Press Aug 10, 2014

Shark attacks are rare in Southwest Florida: Not one person has died from a documented shark attack in the past 131 years.

Only 15 attacks have been recorded in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties, according to the International Shark Attack File, an arm of the University of Florida that keeps records back to 1882. While there are uncountable numbers of sharks plying local waters, Southwest Florida is not shark-bite central. Far from it.

""Nothing in your area,"" said George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File. ""We had one in Okaloosa County and that is the only Gulf of Mexico nip this year.""

While the east coast records dozens of attacks each year, with Florida leading the world in attacks in 2013 with 23, the Southwest coast experiences few attacks. The area is home, however, to one of the most threatening shark species on the planet — the strong-jawed bull.

""It doesn't mean there aren't plenty of sharks in Southwest Florida, and although fatalities are few and far between on both coasts, the fatality rate tends to be higher in the Gulf of Mexico,"" Burgess said. ""One of the big attackers in the Gulf of Mexico is the bull shark. It likes lower salinity levels, and there's a big nursery area in Ten Thousand Islands, the Caloosahatchee River and all along Southwest Florida.""

Bull sharks have more testosterone, per pound, than any animal on the planet. The high hormone levels combined with the strongest bite in the shark world, again pound-for-pound, makes for a particularly dangerous shark. And their teeth are similar to jagged saw blades, sharp enough for a human to use to fillet a fish.

""It's not because they do it more often, it's because they go after larger prey and have teeth that are designed for shearing,"" Burgess said. ""Most of the other sharks, such as the blacktip — which is often involved the most on the east coast, don't have serrations like a steak knife. (Bulls) are a very persistent shark. When they attack it's not unusual for them to come back for a second or third chance. They're persistent. They're No. 1 in Florida.""

Statewide, there have been 11 recorded shark-attack fatalities since 1882. Only four attacks have been fatal along the west coast, the latest coming in 2005 in Walton County in the Panhandle. The closest fatality to this region occurred in 2000 in the Tampa Bay area.

Phil Motta is a shark expert at the University of South Florida who studies how shark jaws function. He said a large bull shark is capable of producing 1,330 pounds of force, which is more, per pound, than great white or tiger sharks can generate.

""We do have quite a few sharks, and we've had sharks attack people spearfishing and a lady standing in shallow water in the Venice area,"" Motta said. ""Then we had the gentleman who was killed when he jumped into a school of fish. Then we had a man that was attacked after he and his family had been diving off a sailboat repeatedly. A bull shark singled him out and attacked repeatedly. But he survived.""

The fatality Motta mentioned was the Tampa Bay area death when a man dived from a dock into a school of baitfish — which was being followed by a large bull shark.

As far as the shark that always has everyone worried — the great white — there simply isn't enough food to sustain them near our shores, and experts say the chance of a white shark biting a person in our area of the Gulf is astronomical — like winning the lottery twice.

1144,Florida's human trafficking bills stir hope and fear,"In 2012 billboards like this from Shared Hope International started going up across the country to raise awareness about the problem of child sex trafficking. (AP Photo/Shared Hope International) (Photo: AP)

Savannah Parvu remembers her parents’ warning not to talk about what went on at home, or she would be taken to a bad place – as though accompanying her mother to score drugs was a good place for an 11-year-old to be.

“My mother’s dealer offered her a $10 dollar piece of crack for me,” said the Central Florida native who went to school by day and serviced johns by night.

“He sold me at a Days Inn. Sometimes it was three or four men, sometimes 10.” Savannah Parvu, sex trafficking viictim

“He sold me at a Days Inn,” Parvu said. “Sometimes it was three or four men, sometimes 10. That’s why this bill is so important to me.”

The bill she worked on with state Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen, R-Fort Myers, is one of several this session taking aim at an activity as old as time: the enslavement of people for labor or sex.

But while the political will is there to do something about it, Parvu has had to adjust her sights lower as efforts to regulate, or even define, trafficking stir controversy.

Holding hotels accountable

Fitzenhagen's bill originally funded a support organization for trafficking victims and mandated training for workers in law enforcement, health care and massage parlors and hotels.

But the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association has made immunity from prosecution a bargaining chip for its participation.

“They want something in the bill saying as long as their staff is trained, even if the staff knew or assisted in trafficking, they would be immune,” Parvu said.

“I believe human trafficking is still undefined in so many ways,”” Ramona Miller, A Voice In The Wilderness

Hotel industry jitters about liability killed last year’s efforts, too.

“We were working on human trafficking until the last night, the last hour, and it failed,""

Fitzenhagen said.

The reason was a cause of action that would have allowed survivors to sue hotels if they knowingly turned a blind eye,

Now that part’s gone, but Fitzenhagen and her Senate counterpart Lauren Book, D-Plantation, still have to negotiate whether or not to trade off victims’ rights for the industry's participation. And they have less than a week -- the legislative session ends May 3.

Conservatively, hotels are the venue for 20 percent of sex trafficking cases in Southwest Florida, according to the Human Trafficking Data Project.

But anecdotally, “Motels are huge,"" said Ramona Miller, an outreach worker on the streets of Lee County. “If human trafficking was to discontinue, in the area where I work, those people (motel owners) would be out of business.”

“It’s a little hard to tell if someone is forced.” Shailendra Patel, Golfview Motel owner

That’s because Miller sees trafficking not only in organized rings, but also in a pimp’s use of drugs or emotional manipulation to exploit a few sex workers.



“I believe human trafficking is still undefined in so many ways,” Miller said. “Because it is so broad and so hidden, you have two kinds of data: from those hitting the ground, and from hearsay, after the fact.”

While resisting legislation, the industry is taking voluntary steps to combat trafficking:

""We have a moral obligation to do all we can to prevent this atrocious crime,"" the Florida association wrote as a preface to its new, free online awareness course.

Marriott International recently announced 500,000 of its staff have taken human trafficking awareness training.

“It’s a little hard to tell if someone is forced, said Shailendra Patel, owner of Fort Myers' Golfview Motell, who took the online course offered by the Asian American Hotel Owners Association. ""We’re just trying to learn.”

Naming names

Legislators must also resolve their differences over what’s informally being called the ‘john’s registry': a database of people found guilty of “soliciting, inducing, enticing, or procuring” another to commit “prostitution, lewdness, or assignation.”

“Guess what, prostitution is illegal.” State Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen

The loose definition has sex workers alarmed they’ll be caught in the net, but that’s not why Fitzenhagen struck it from her version. She wants to make sure the registry doesn’t violate a right to privacy.

Four men who recently moved to Lehigh Acres have been arrested after an eight-month investigation into human trafficking involving teen victims. One other man and a woman were also arrested as part of the investigation which also involved the Lee County and Marion County sheriff's offices and the St. Petersburg Police Department. (Photo: Special to The News-Press)

“I think it’s a disgrace that sex workers are coming before the House and Senate, saying you are going to make me scared of the police, reduce my income and hurt my family if I get arrested,” she said. Well, guess what, prostitution is illegal.”

Not so fast, say others like Jennifer Murphy, a Fort Myers counselor whose clients are sex crime victims.

“If people are just talking about sex trafficking, that is not the entire conversation,” Jennfer Murphy, sex abuse counselor

“If people are just talking about sex trafficking, that is not the entire conversation,"" Murphy said. ""No one grows up healthy and says, 'I'm going to sell my body.' The problem is rampant sexual abuse.”

Instead of a ‘name and shame’ approach, the therapist, who also produces training programs, would like to see education aimed at reducing the demand for commercial sex, including pornography, and empowering people to recognize and avoid abusers.

Can we talk?

As a junior high student Christy Ivie wanted someone to ask the question that would allow her to spill the secret of her father’s sexual abuse.

Christy Ivie is the founder of Christy’s Cause. (Photo: Special to The News-Press)

“I knew my teachers knew,” said the founder of Christy’s Cause dedicated to helping victims of child trafficking. “I was begging internally for someone to say something, but no one did.”

That’s why she supports a bill that would teach trafficking awareness in public schools. Although she was never trafficked, Ivie sees abuse and trafficking as cousins.

“Statistics show trafficking victims are vulnerable because they’ve been abused as children,"" she said; and ""less than one percent are ever identified in part because no one’s talking.

In Ivie’s case, she said her father alternately beat her to enforce secrecy and assured her that father-daughter sex was normal.

“I was begging internally for someone to say something, but no one did.” Christy Ivie, Christy's Cause

The bill would help Florida students avoid dating violence and abuse and understand what makes a healthy relationship, as well as recognize signs of human trafficking.

Protection or victim blaming?

A minimum penalty bill for sex traffickers raised a concern by Brent Woody, the lead attorney for the Justice Restoration Center, that victims could be traumatized in the sentencing process, which relies on proving they weren’t acting voluntarily.

""I have sat through numerous human trafficking cases where a trafficker's defense attorney dragged a survivor through the dirt, called her a ‘whore,"" Woody wrote in an email. “It’s an awful and traumatizing experience that the State could, as far as we know, compel a victim to go through.

“Human trafficking is a buzz word with funding attached to it.” Ramona Miller, A Voice In The Wilderness

Ultimately, the questions of who is a victim and who a criminal will have to be defined in order to be legislated and funded.

Buy Photo Ramona Miller of A Voice in the Wilderness plans to head into the streets to work with her clients including lovers Lucy Tapia and Ana Novicki who ride with her in the back seat. (Photo: Andrew West/The News-Press)

For some like Miller and Murphy, who work in the trenches, the definitions are too simplistic and likely to create winners and losers.

""Human trafficking is a buzz word with funding attached to it,"" Miller said.

In the rush to count numbers of victims in order to qualify for grant funds, she urges caution when vetting survivor stories to make sure they can recount a clear narrative of events.

For other Tallahassee watchers, something is better than nothing.

Speaking of the Fitzenhagen bill, which dropped the training requirement for hotels, ""It's not what I want,"" Parvu said, ""but it's better than losing the whole bill.""

1146,Local golf: Bartow standout commits to Florida Southern,"While Bryce Walker is still only a junior in high school, the standout from Winter Haven’s Collegiate High School has already chosen a landing spot for college golf – Florida Southern.

In a win for local golf, Walker, a Bartow native who competes for Bartow High School, announced his commitment via social media last week. Bartow pro Chris Banks was thrilled about the news. Walker recently won the “Next 100 Junior Invitational” at Mission Hills.

“Bryce is not only a great aspiring golfer, but an even better young man,"" Banks said. ""He works very hard and will definitely flourish at Florida Southern. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for him.”

The early signing period for high school juniors begins in November, so Walker plans to sign a letter of intent this fall, making his plans official. In Walker’s final season of high school play next fall, he will look to improve upon an already impressive stroke average of 72 as a junior. After finishing FHSAA play, Walker has continued to impress with Florida Junior Tour results, including four top -0 finishes already in 2019.

Walker’s next event is a Florida Junior Tour stop at Black Diamond Ranch, beginning May 11th.

SEU women set program record

The 14th ranked Southeastern University women’s team picked an ideal time to set a new, one-day program record — the final round of The Sun Conference Championship.

Riding the hot play of sophomore Lakeland Christian graduate Ashlynn Joyner, the ladies recorded a 305, besting their previous record of 306, which they’d set just the day before. For the 54-hole event, the team was led by Ana Uribe, who hails from Bogota, Colombia. The junior shot three straight 76’s to finish eighth and was voted to the All-Sun All-Conference team. Joyner’s 80 -76-75 gave her an 11th place finish, followed by sophomore Valentina Espinosa, who was 16th.

The tournament was won by No. 1-ranked Keiser University by 11 strokes over No. 2-ranked Savannah College of Art and Design. SEU finished in third, ahead of South Carolina-Beufort, which is ranked seventh.

The Fire now wait until May 3 to see whether they receive an at-large bid to nationals, which will be in Oklahoma City.

FSC men ranked 7th

In the final poll before the NCAA Division II tournament begins May 9, the Florida Southern men's team slid three spots in a poll dominated by schools in the Sunshine State Conference.

On April 19, the Bushnell Golfweek Coaches Poll remained largely the same versus the prior rendition, with the top three teams remaining the same. Barry University earned it’s seventh consecutive top billing after winning the conference tournament by six shots over second-ranked Lynn. West Florida remained in third after taking the Gulf South Conference tournament by three shots over 25th ranked Valdosta State. The Sunshine State Conference occupies five of the top 10 spots and two more in the top 20.

The Mocs' bid for 14th national championship starts at the Super Regional hosted by Rollins College just outside Orlando.

1148,Florida man charged with attempted murder smiles in mugshot,"LAKE COUNTY, Fla. - A Florida man accused of opening fire on two men at a Lake County park smiled for his mugshot.

Tavares police said Channen Quashie, 29, of Eustis, was arrested Thursday night after an officer who was investigating a report of a stolen vehicle at the corner of Lake Avenue and Main Street heard what sounded like five gunshots coming from the area of Ingraham Park.

The officer went to where they thought the gun was fired and came across a white car with several bullet holes in the rear driver's side panel. The driver's side window was also shattered, according to a police report.

Police said the man who was sitting in the driver's seat when the shooting started told officers he saw Quashie pull up in a black SUV, roll down the front window and smile before firing the gun at the victim and his friends.

The victim said he exited the car and jumped on the ground to avoid getting hit, the report said.

A friend of the victim said he was standing outside the vehicle talking to the victim when Quashie pulled up and fired about three to four shots in his direction, police said. The friend said he was previously in the United States Army and felt as if he was ""still in Iraq"" when the shooting started, according to the report.

Police said they found a bullet casing in the middle of Ruby Street while processing the scene.

Lake County deputies and Eustis police officers, who had been given a description of the black SUV Quashie was believed to be in when the shooting happened, later found the vehicle in Eustis and took Quashie into custody on Glover Street, the report said.

Quashie was taken to the Lake County Jail and faces two felony counts of attempted murder and one count of discharging a firearm in public.

1157,"Elmer Tremont, Fort Myers and Cypress Lake High coaching icon, dies at 89","Fort Myers High School girls basketball coach Elmer Tremont watches intently from the sidelines as his team battles it out during a close game with Cypress Lake at Fort Myers in 2002. (Photo: news-press.com file photo)

Elmer Tremont, an area coaching icon, a man who coached and won more games of any kind than anyone in Lee County high school athletics history, reclined in a chair to watch an NBA playoff game Thursday night at his daughter’s home in Lithia. He fell asleep and never woke up.

Tremont, a record-setting punter at the University of Miami and a high school boys and girls basketball and football coach for more than 50 years in Fort Myers, died at the age of 89, sometime in the early hours of Friday morning. He would have turned 90 on Nov. 28.

“There were so many layers to his career,” said Sam Sirianni Jr., whose father’s iconic, 33-year varsity football coaching career overlapped with Tremont’s in basketball.

Tremont won 732 games in football, volleyball and boys and girls basketball over 54 years, all in Lee County. Many of those victories came at Cypress Lake in basketball, as he led the Panthers boys teams often to the state playoffs and even to the state’s final four in 1982.

In 1986, Dave LaRosa first met Tremont after arriving to Cypress Lake from West Virginia as a young teacher and future principal.

“One of the things you could always tell, without even knowing Coach Tremont, you knew from seeing him interacting with other people,” LaRosa said. “When he appeared somewhere, he turned people to him. You could always tell when somebody has a great amount of influence. He always had the ability to do that. Being young and new to the area and not knowing anything about him, I saw that right away. I knew that this guy was something. It didn’t take me long to understand the significance of him.”

Tremont began his coaching career in the 1950s at Fort Myers High after serving for two years as a medic for the U.S. Army in the Korean War.

Born Nov. 28, 1929, Tremont grew up in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. He and his wife Betty Jo, 88, had three children: Linda, Joanne and Teresa.

Linda died from cancer, and Teresa died in a drowning accident, in which her father found her in their home pool two years ago.

“He never really recovered from that,” Joanne Tremont said. The past four months especially have been rough on Elmer Tremont and his wife.

Family and friends are focusing on the joy and the discipline he gave to more than two generations of Lee County student-athletes.

“He was a great coach, and he was also a very good friend,” said Tim Lewis, 75, who played football and basketball for Tremont during the 1950s at Fort Myers High. “He was kind of like a father. I was very close to him. I’m going to miss him very much. He did more for Lee County than anybody, boys and girls, because he coached both.

“He had a lot to do with my life. He was a mean son of a gun. He kicked me off the basketball team in 1959. The whole season, my sophomore year. He did what was right, and I did what was wrong. I don’t remember nothing, but I can remember that.”

Tremont lorded over his 1970s teams as an authoritarian figure, albeit a beloved one.

""Ah, rule No. 1 is that Coach is always right,"" Cypress Lake basketball player Calvin Harrison told The News-Press in 1977, as Tremont glared at him to give the right answer. ""Rule No. 2 is to refer to No. 1 when in doubt what to do.""

The desire for warm weather led Tremont to Lee County by way of the University of Miami. He still holds the Gator Bowl record for punting, averaging 44.5 yards on nine punts, set in 1952 during a 14-0 victory against Clemson.

“He finished high school, and then he got recruited by many schools,” Joanne Tremont said. “A punter and a defensive back. But he chose Miami. He was from the north, and he wanted the warmth and the beaches and everything he never had before. He never traveled much.”

Joanne said she was the “boy of the family,” as she often tagged along with her dad to basketball practices.

“He was like a superhero to me,” she said. “I was proud of him. He was very, very serious about doing the best that he could for the youth of Lee County. When he was at Cypress Lake, he said he never worked a day in his life. He truly loved working with the kids and coaching. He had this drive. Believe me, I know. I don’t play games anymore with people. I’m too competitive. It was in our blood. If you don’t think you can win, then don’t play. That’s just his mentality.”

In the late 1980s, ‘90s and 2000s, Elmer Tremont often “retired” from coaching, only to unretire and resurface at other schools: Estero, where he helped establish the school’s athletic programs in 1987, Fort Myers during the 1990s and as an assistant girls coach at Bishop Verot and Fort Myers during the 2000s.

“Every time he retired, I’d get a new job, and I’d bring him back,” said James Browder, former Lee County superintendent and principal at Estero, Cypress Lake and Fort Myers high schools. “He’s the best basketball coach anywhere. He put every program that I’d put him into that was in disarray and get that program going again. He did it at Cypress. He did it at Fort Myers. He’ll do it in heaven now.”

Tremont leaves a legacy beyond coaching. Twenty-two years ago, he and his friend Monk Hillmyer established the Hillmyer-Tremont Foundation. It held its annual banquet Monday night and awarded three more scholarships, bringing the 22-year total to $1.8 million in scholarship money for local student-athletes.

“Monk Hillmyer was a big business leader, and coach Tremont was the coach,” said Sam Crimaldi, who helps run the foundation. Hillmyer died in 2008. “They were best friends. They went to the Final Four together. They focused not only on their jobs but the greater good of the community.”

Funeral services for Elmer Tremont are slated for 11 a.m. Tuesday, May 21, at Church of the Resurrection of our Lord, at 8121 Cypress Lake Drive, in Fort Myers.

“We had a lot of fun,” said pastor Ed McNamara, who will do the service and has known Elmer Tremont since 1972. “It was just a fun relationship with him. He was just an all-around guy, loved by everyone who ever met him.”

Cypress Lake High School named its gymnasium after Tremont in 1996 and rededicated it to him in 2006 when it was rebuilt following its 2004 destruction by Hurricane Charley.

The Lee County School Athletic Conference Hall of Fame inducted Tremont in 2013.

The Florida Athletic Coaches Association inducted Tremont into its Hall of Fame in 1984. The Florida High School Athletic Association so far has denied Tremont a spot in its hall of fame, an omission LaRosa hopes to someday change.

Sirianni and LaRosa each said Tremont’s career victory mark and long tenure never would be matched.

“Think about that,” Sirianni said. “Fifty years in one community. In today’s structure, the way high school sports and club sports and all the social media, it’s very hard to believe that somebody could coach for that long. You’re talking about just a handful of people who can leave that kind of legacy. He gave back with his foundation. Elmer Tremont, he’s got to go down as one of the legends.”

The Coast Guard's St. Petersburg station received a Marine Emergency Response Team alert reporting a 15' pontoon boat was taking on water near Bokeelia in the northern part of Pine Island.

A response boat crew from the Fort Myers Beach Coast Guard station arrived on scene and reported the vessel taking on water but could still travel. Charlotte County Fire and Rescue and Lake County Sheriff's Office assisted.

The boat crew safely escorted the pontoon boat to the Burnt Store Boat Ramp with no reported injuries.

1160,"Plenty of sharks, but few attacks; There's been no local fatalities in 131 years","Bull shark

Editor's note: This story was originally published in The News-Press Aug 10, 2014

Shark attacks are rare in Southwest Florida: Not one person has died from a documented shark attack in the past 131 years.

Only 15 attacks have been recorded in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties, according to the International Shark Attack File, an arm of the University of Florida that keeps records back to 1882. While there are uncountable numbers of sharks plying local waters, Southwest Florida is not shark-bite central. Far from it.

""Nothing in your area,"" said George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File. ""We had one in Okaloosa County and that is the only Gulf of Mexico nip this year.""

While the east coast records dozens of attacks each year, with Florida leading the world in attacks in 2013 with 23, the Southwest coast experiences few attacks. The area is home, however, to one of the most threatening shark species on the planet — the strong-jawed bull.

""It doesn't mean there aren't plenty of sharks in Southwest Florida, and although fatalities are few and far between on both coasts, the fatality rate tends to be higher in the Gulf of Mexico,"" Burgess said. ""One of the big attackers in the Gulf of Mexico is the bull shark. It likes lower salinity levels, and there's a big nursery area in Ten Thousand Islands, the Caloosahatchee River and all along Southwest Florida.""

Bull sharks have more testosterone, per pound, than any animal on the planet. The high hormone levels combined with the strongest bite in the shark world, again pound-for-pound, makes for a particularly dangerous shark. And their teeth are similar to jagged saw blades, sharp enough for a human to use to fillet a fish.

""It's not because they do it more often, it's because they go after larger prey and have teeth that are designed for shearing,"" Burgess said. ""Most of the other sharks, such as the blacktip — which is often involved the most on the east coast, don't have serrations like a steak knife. (Bulls) are a very persistent shark. When they attack it's not unusual for them to come back for a second or third chance. They're persistent. They're No. 1 in Florida.""

Statewide, there have been 11 recorded shark-attack fatalities since 1882. Only four attacks have been fatal along the west coast, the latest coming in 2005 in Walton County in the Panhandle. The closest fatality to this region occurred in 2000 in the Tampa Bay area.

Phil Motta is a shark expert at the University of South Florida who studies how shark jaws function. He said a large bull shark is capable of producing 1,330 pounds of force, which is more, per pound, than great white or tiger sharks can generate.

""We do have quite a few sharks, and we've had sharks attack people spearfishing and a lady standing in shallow water in the Venice area,"" Motta said. ""Then we had the gentleman who was killed when he jumped into a school of fish. Then we had a man that was attacked after he and his family had been diving off a sailboat repeatedly. A bull shark singled him out and attacked repeatedly. But he survived.""

The fatality Motta mentioned was the Tampa Bay area death when a man dived from a dock into a school of baitfish — which was being followed by a large bull shark.

As far as the shark that always has everyone worried — the great white — there simply isn't enough food to sustain them near our shores, and experts say the chance of a white shark biting a person in our area of the Gulf is astronomical — like winning the lottery twice.

1162,Man accused of killing Winter Park caretaker could be closer to trial date,"ORLANDO, Fla. - A man accused of kidnapping and killing a Winter Park caretaker was in court on Friday to discuss when his trial could start.

Scott Nelson was arrested in 2017 in connection with the death of Jennifer Fulford, who was found dead in west Orange County days after she was reported missing.

Now, nearly two years after her death, Nelson may be closer to a trial.

Lawyers on both sides argued over motions ahead of his trial, slated to begin June 10 if Nelson's defense team decides to waive a speedy trial.

This comes a little more than a week after a judge ruled him competent to stand trial.

Judge Keith White addressed Nelson about a speedy trial during Friday's status hearing.

""The speedy trial issue, it is my understanding that at this juncture, sir, you do not want to waive a speedy trial. Is that correct?"" White asked.

""That is correct,"" Nelson replied.

Nelson's defense team noted 22 motions Friday, more than half of which they requested to be dismissed.

One motion that was tabled until further information is available is the time in which Nelson would appear in court if his case went to trial.

Court documents state it's protocol for a person to be transported by 4 a.m. but Nelson's attorneys pushed to have that time moved to 8 a.m.

White advised the council at the jail make that decision.

Court will resume at 9 a.m. Monday morning.

1163,Deputies: Child porn found in Middleburg man's home,"MIDDLEBURG, Fla. - A man was arrested at his Middleburg home Friday after investigators determined he was in possession of child porn, according to the Clay County Sheriff's Office.

On April 3, a search warrant was served at Steven Windle Burnsed's home on Crazy Horse Avenue. According to his arrest report, Burnsed agreed to speak with the responding deputy. However, their conversation was heavily redacted.

The Sheriff's Office said Burnsed used the social media site Tumblr to upload child porn. While taking electronics from Burnsed's home into evidence, an investigator discovered child porn in the house.

Burnsed was charged with 10 counts of felony possession of child porn. A bond was not immediately set.

Burnsed's first court appearance was scheduled for Saturday.

1166,Man suspected of killing wife takes his life in standoff with authorities,"WESTON, Fla. - A man suspected of killing his wife in her Weston home this week killed himself late Thursday after a standoff with authorities in central Florida, deputies said.

Gina Carter, a spokeswoman for the Broward County Sheriff's Office, said the U.S. Marshal’s Task Force, Broward detectives and local authorities tracked 39-year-old Angel Garcia Sanchez to a home in Venus, a small town about 50 northeast of Fort Myers.

When deputies could not make contact with Sanchez, they entered the home and found Sanchez dead inside with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Carter said.

Investigators later determined that when a Highland County Sheriff's Office SWAT team vehicle approached the home, Sanchez fired several shots in their direction, but no one was struck, Carter said.

Sanchez is suspected of killing his wife, 34-year-old Carolyn Espinosa. She was found dead Wednesday inside her home in the 36000 block of San Simeon Circle. Carter said Espinosa and Sanchez had separated and were preparing to divorce.

Anyone with information about the case is asked to called Broward County Sheriff's Office homicide Detective Zach Scott at 954-3321-4162.

1167,"Florida bills on human trafficking stir hope, fear as efforts to regulate industry stir controversy","In 2012 billboards like this from Shared Hope International started going up across the country to raise awareness about the problem of child sex trafficking. (AP Photo/Shared Hope International) (Photo: AP)

Savannah Parvu remembers her parents’ warning not to talk about what went on at home, or she would be taken to a bad place — as though accompanying her mother to score drugs was a good place for an 11-year-old to be.

“My mother’s dealer offered her a $10 dollar piece of crack for me,” said the Central Florida native who went to school by day and serviced johns by night.

“He sold me at a Days Inn,” Parvu said. “Sometimes it was three or four men, sometimes 10. That’s why this bill is so important to me.”

“He sold me at a Days Inn. Sometimes it was three or four men, sometimes 10.” Savannah Parvu, sex trafficking viictim

The bill she worked on with state Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen, R-Fort Myers, is one of several this session taking aim at an activity as old as time: the enslavement of people for labor or sex.

But while the political will is there to do something about it, Parvu has had to adjust her sights lower as efforts to regulate, or even define, trafficking stir controversy.

And the full story: Florida human trafficking ring, prostitution in massage parlors

Holding hotels accountable

Fitzenhagen's bill originally funded a support organization for trafficking victims and mandated training for workers in law enforcement, health care and massage parlors and hotels.

But the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association has made immunity from prosecution a bargaining chip for its participation.

“They want something in the bill saying as long as their staff is trained, even if the staff knew or assisted in trafficking, they would be immune,” Parvu said.

Hotel industry jitters about liability killed last year’s efforts, too.

Column: When human trafficking victims live right under our noses, how can we stop it?

“We were working on human trafficking until the last night, the last hour, and it failed,""

Fitzenhagen said.

The reason was a cause of action that would have allowed survivors to sue hotels if they knowingly turned a blind eye,

More: Florida human trafficking ring had ties to New York, China: It started at massage parlor

Now that part’s gone, but Fitzenhagen and her Senate counterpart Lauren Book, D-Plantation, still have to negotiate whether or not to trade off victims’ rights for the industry's participation. And they have less than a week -- the legislative session ends May 3.

Conservatively, hotels are the venue for 20 percent of sex trafficking cases in Southwest Florida, according to the Human Trafficking Data Project.

But anecdotally, “Motels are huge,"" said Ramona Miller, an outreach worker on the streets of Lee County. “If human trafficking was to discontinue, in the area where I work, those people (motel owners) would be out of business.”

“I believe human trafficking is still undefined in so many ways,”” Ramona Miller, A Voice In The Wilderness

That’s because Miller sees trafficking not only in organized rings, but also in a pimp’s use of drugs or emotional manipulation to exploit a few sex workers.



“I believe human trafficking is still undefined in so many ways,” Miller said. “Because it is so broad and so hidden, you have two kinds of data: from those hitting the ground, and from hearsay, after the fact.”

While resisting legislation, the industry is taking voluntary steps to combat trafficking:

""We have a moral obligation to do all we can to prevent this atrocious crime,"" the Florida association wrote as a preface to its new, free online awareness course.

Marriott International recently announced 500,000 of its staff have taken human trafficking awareness training.

“It’s a little hard to tell if someone is forced, said Shailendra Patel, owner of Fort Myers' Golfview Motell, who took the online course offered by the Asian American Hotel Owners Association. ""We’re just trying to learn.”

Naming names

Legislators must also resolve their differences over what’s informally being called the ‘john’s registry': a database of people found guilty of “soliciting, inducing, enticing, or procuring” another to commit “prostitution, lewdness, or assignation.”

The loose definition has sex workers alarmed they’ll be caught in the net, but that’s not why Fitzenhagen struck it from her version. She wants to make sure the registry doesn’t violate a right to privacy.

“I think it’s a disgrace that sex workers are coming before the House and Senate, saying you are going to make me scared of the police, reduce my income and hurt my family if I get arrested,” she said. Well, guess what, prostitution is illegal.”

“Guess what, prostitution is illegal.” State Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen

Not so fast, say others like Jennifer Murphy, a Fort Myers counselor whose clients are sex crime victims.

“If people are just talking about sex trafficking, that is not the entire conversation,"" Murphy said. ""No one grows up healthy and says, 'I'm going to sell my body.' The problem is rampant sexual abuse.”

Instead of a ‘name and shame’ approach, the therapist, who also produces training programs, would like to see education aimed at reducing the demand for commercial sex, including pornography, and empowering people to recognize and avoid abusers.

Four men who recently moved to Lehigh Acres have been arrested after an eight-month investigation into human trafficking involving teen victims. One other man and a woman were also arrested as part of the investigation which also involved the Lee County and Marion County sheriff's offices and the St. Petersburg Police Department.

Can we talk?

As a junior high student Christy Ivie wanted someone to ask the question that would allow her to spill the secret of her father’s sexual abuse.

“I knew my teachers knew,” said the founder of Christy’s Cause dedicated to helping victims of child trafficking. “I was begging internally for someone to say something, but no one did.”

Christy Ivie is the founder and president of Christy’s Cause, a non-profit organization working to eradicate child sex trafficking. (Photo: Jack Hardman/The News-Press, Jack Hardman/The News-Press)

That’s why she supports a bill that would teach trafficking awareness in public schools. Although she was never trafficked, Ivie sees abuse and trafficking as cousins.

“Statistics show trafficking victims are vulnerable because they’ve been abused as children,"" she said; and ""less than one percent are ever identified in part because no one’s talking.

In Ivie’s case, she said her father alternately beat her to enforce secrecy and assured her that father-daughter sex was normal.

The bill would help Florida students avoid dating violence and abuse and understand what makes a healthy relationship, as well as recognize signs of human trafficking.

Protection or victim blaming?

A minimum penalty bill for sex traffickers raised a concern by Brent Woody, the lead attorney for the Justice Restoration Center, that victims could be traumatized in the sentencing process, which relies on proving they weren’t acting voluntarily.

""I have sat through numerous human trafficking cases where a trafficker's defense attorney dragged a survivor through the dirt, called her a ‘whore,"" Woody wrote in an email. “It’s an awful and traumatizing experience that the State could, as far as we know, compel a victim to go through.

Ultimately, the questions of who is a victim and who a criminal will have to be defined in order to be legislated and funded.

For some like Miller and Murphy, who work in the trenches, the definitions are too simplistic and likely to create winners and losers.

“Human trafficking is a buzz word with funding attached to it.” Ramona Miller, A Voice In The Wilderness

""Human trafficking is a buzz word with funding attached to it,"" Miller said.

In the rush to count numbers of victims in order to qualify for grant funds, she urges caution when vetting survivor stories to make sure they can recount a clear narrative of events.

For other Tallahassee watchers, something is better than nothing.

Speaking of the Fitzenhagen bill, which dropped the training requirement for hotels, ""It's not what I want,"" Parvu said, ""but it's better than losing the whole bill.""

1168,Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz to get inheritance; public defenders want off the case,"CLOSE In newly released video from after his arrest, Parkland school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz said he planned to shoot people at a park. USA TODAY

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The public defenders for the Parkland school massacre defendant unexpectedly asked to withdraw from the case Wednesday, saying the 20-year-old man will soon inherit nearly a half-million dollars and no longer qualify for free legal representation.

The Broward County Public Defender's Office filed the unexpected notice late Wednesday, saying Nikolas Cruz is set to receive more than $432,000 shortly from his late mother's life insurance policy. Under state law, the public defender can only represent defendants who cannot afford private attorneys.

Cruz is charged with 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted murder arising from the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The former Stoneman Douglas student faces a possible death sentence.

More: Nikolas Cruz's brother: ‘I'm stuck between loving him and hating him because of what he did’

Public Defender Howard Finkelstein and his chief assistant, Gordon Weekes, said their office learned about the insurance policy this week. At a court hearing last year, their office had said the amount was likely to be about $30,000, too little to hire a private attorney.

""By statute, we can only represent the poor and indigent,"" Weekes told The Associated Press by phone Wednesday. ""We are asking to withdraw from the case because the defendant is no longer poor.""

But Cruz may not get the money. It is likely that the victims' families who are suing Cruz will claim the money should go to them and judges will have to determine who ultimately receives it.

More: Nikolas Cruz, who is charged in the Parkland school massacre, is due for a court hearing

Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer, who is presiding over the criminal case, has not set a hearing on the public defenders' withdrawal motion and she might require them to stay on until that is settled.

David Brill, an attorney representing the father of victim Meadow Pollack in a lawsuit against Cruz and others, said Wednesday that he is exploring his options. Other attorneys representing families and victims did not immediately respond to emails seeking their comments.

Weekes said that his office cannot help Cruz hire a private criminal defense attorney nor can it advise him what to do with the money. It is also unclear how Cruz would access the money from jail.

Cruz has said that he would prefer any money he received from his mother's estate or insurance go to the victims and their families. Lynda Cruz died of pneumonia in November 2017, three months before the shooting, leaving behind Cruz and his younger brother, Zachary. Their father died when they were young, not long after they were adopted.

The mother had a tumultuous relationship with her sons, calling police dozens of times over the years to say they had been verbally abusive or had damaged her property. Zachary and other family members have said Nikolas Cruz sometimes hit his mother and once threatened her with a gun, but she never reported that. She went with him to buy a gun shortly after he turned 18, but with a caveat.

A gun store employee told investigators after the shooting that he had received a call from Linda Cruz the day after the 2017 purchase. She asked him not to release the gun to him after the three-day waiting period if she wasn't there. When he pressed her on why, she hesitated and then said he was young and she wanted him to be safe.

Cruz's trial is scheduled to begin early next year. Finkelstein said it is too early to say whether this new development would delay the trial, ""but it certainly won't speed it up."" His office has estimated that more than a million documents have been generated in the case, which would have to be transferred to a new attorney.

Cruz has pleaded not guilty though Finkelstein has said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. They declined comment Wednesday.

TAMARAC, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a Florida man left threatening rants about gun control, illegal immigration, homosexuals, black people and Muslims for three Democratic members of Congress.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office says 49-year-old John Kless was arrested Friday and charged with making threatening communications.

A federal criminal complaint says Kless called the Washington offices of Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey on Tuesday and left profanity-laden voicemails for each politician. The messages specifically mentioned the elected officials being killed. Swalwell and Booker are both running for president.

ST. LUCIE COUNTY — An incident in which a woman apparently used an electronic device to scam an arcade is the first time St. Lucie County sheriff’s investigators have encountered such a device, according to an official Tuesday and an affidavit.

Karolyn Griffith, 30, of Sanford, was arrested May 3 on charges related to grand theft, fraud and giving false information to a law enforcement officer.

Deputies about 3:15 a.m. went to the Gold Rush arcade in the 6600 block of South U.S. 1 and spoke to Griffith, who investigators said tried to hide “a black electronic box with a red button and an antenna,” an affidavit states.

An employee said Griffith was winning too much money and it didn’t make sense.

Representatives at other arcades said they know of such devices.

Michael Shine said he manages the Tropicana arcade, which opened recently a short drive south of Gold Rush on the west side of U.S. 1

“We know that these devices are out there,” Shine said. “We haven’t seen them as of yet in our place, but we’re very tight on our security.”

Shine said there are different devices, with some incorporated into cell phones or garage door opening-type objects.

He described them as electro-magnetic pulse devices that can manipulate the credit counter in machines.

Investigators tested the Griffith's device. A deputy switched on the device and was able to add credits to one of the machines.

Shine suggested other arcades remain vigilant.

“People are less likely to do things when they feel like they’re being watched,” Shine said.

Meg Pizano works at 777 arcade in a plaza south of Shine’s business.

Pizano said she's heard of such devices. She said they have installed alarms on machines that go off when someone tries to use them.

“There’s all kinds of tricks in this business,” Pizano said.

Pizano said 90 percent of her business is regulars, and when a new face comes in, ""you watch them.

“That’s your job. We don’t know this person,” she said. “Nobody else knows this person.”

She said she talks to people, and asks questions.

In the Gold Rush case, the amount of money missing from the two machines totaled nearly $2,800.

A sheriff’s official said the case is the first time the agency has encountered such a device.

They ""are placed in close proximity to the gaming machine and use a radio frequency to manipulate the programming of the machine to add ‘credits,’” according to the sheriff’s office.

Griffith was the only person arrested, but investigators say it did not appear she was alone.

1179,Skirmish at North Fort Myers community over a Vietnam War memorial mural settled ... unhappily,"A skirmish between residents and management at a North Fort Myers development involving a memorial to the Vietnam War ended peacefully if not unhappily Tuesday.

The issue arose seemingly overnight when residents of the Del Tura Golf & Country Club began talking on social media sites about a mural on a garage door painted in black and depicting a Vietnam War-era soldier kneeling before a cross with a helicopter flying in the background.

Community officials sent Bob Masson, 71, a Vietnam War vet and the mural's owner, a letter asking him to remove the depiction. Apparently there also had been a complaint.

""It feels like I've been kicked in the head,"" Masson said. ""It feels like (his service in the war) meant nothing right now. It meant a lot to us when we were over there.""

NextDoor is a social media site that developments such as Del Tura, gated communities and local communities can join to find out goings-on for their specific areas.

Richard Dzedzej, a resident at Del Tura, said the homeowner is a Vietnam veteran and was going to comply with the letter he received and paint over the picture.

""Other veterans told him that there is nothing wrong with it and to leave it intact,"" Dzedzej said.

Eventually Fred Taylor, the community manager, came out and addressed the residents.

""I'm happy to answer questions,"" Taylor told them. ""But not with the news present.""

Taylor told the group before moving inside the clubhouse that he was unaware they would be coming to meet with him with the news media present.

When questioned about the letter Taylor said Masson had not sought the proper approval despite community rules that disallow any mural on a garage door.

""I explained it is not the content of the graphic,"" Taylor said before asking the residents to meet with him in private. ""It is any graphic.""

Taylor pointed out that the community flies a POW flag on its main flagpole.

After the meeting the residents said they were satisfied but some were still a bit rankled that it was handled the way it was.

""I consider it unhappily settled,"" Dzedzej said. ""I understand the point but do think they could have let him keep it.""

Dzedzej's son Mike doesn't live at Del Tura but was visiting with his veteran dad and wasn't happy either.

""I think it's nonsense that he has to take it down,"" he said.

Masson, who has a flagpole with the POW and U.S. flags flying, and statues of military figures on his front lawn in basically the same configuration as the mural, said he put up the mural three months ago.

""I'm a military man all the way,"" Masson said. ""I'm just appalled that I have to take this off. It took them three months to send me the letter. But I see their point, they have a job to do.""

He said he was told he could keep the mural until Memorial Day and then replace it with a flag of the same topic or a plexiglass depiction and place it alongside the house. He said the brief battle won't prompt him to move.

""I have a lot of good friends, veterans, behind me 100 percent. I'm very disappointed,"" he said. ""But I'll get over it. ... I'll bite the bullet.""

1181,Outside firm may represent Sarasota deputy accused of shattering man's face,"The potential cost to taxpayers is unknown.

SARASOTA COUNTY — The county is looking to lawyer up with an outside firm to represent a Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office deputy in a civil suit alleging that he body slammed a homeless man in custody, leaving him with a partially shattered face that required surgery to fix.

The county attorney’s office at Tuesday’s Sarasota County Commission meeting plans to ask the board to allow the office to hire an outside law firm to represent Deputy Shaun Martin, who is accused of slamming Michael Basile head first onto the concrete floor of the Sarasota County jail's booking area in 2015. The county attorney’s office is going to represent Deputy Michael McMahan and Sheriff Tom Knight, who are also named as defendants in the case. County Attorney Frederick Elbrecht in an April 30 memo to the commission wrote it is appropriate for the law firm of Burgess, Harrell, Mancuso, Colton and La Porta to represent Martin to avoid a potential conflict with the county attorney’s office.

“Because of the nature of the allegations in the complaint, there would be a potential conflict if the office of the county attorney were to also represent Deputy Martin in addition to Sheriff Knight and Deputy McMahan,” the memo states.

It’s unclear how much the outside firm could cost and what kind of conflict could arise if the county attorney’s office represented all three defendants.

The county attorney’s office declined to comment Monday on the pending litigation.

Failure to reach a settlement could cost the county more than $100,000 in attorney’s fees and court costs through a trial if litigation is successful, Basile’s attorney Robert Watrous wrote in a letter to the county attorney’s office on March 8.

Basile, who filed the lawsuit on March 19, is seeking $200,000 in damages after he sustained severe facial injuries following the incident, which was captured by video surveillance cameras.

“Basile briefly lost consciousness after his head struck the ground and remained motionless on the floor, visibly bleeding, until medical care was rendered to him,” the suit states. “As a direct result of the excessive force, Basile was taken to Sarasota Memorial Hospital where surgery was performed to repair traumatic injury to the bone of the eye socket, the removal of several teeth, a bone graft and the installation of metal hardware placed inside the orbit and along the zygomatic arch of Basile’s left eye socket.”

Basile alleges Martin and McMahan also filed a false police report against Basile, initiating a criminal prosecution, which was later dropped.

The county this year offered Basile a $5,000 settlement that he declined, a representative of the law firm representing Basile told the Herald-Tribune in March.

Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Kaitlyn Perez in March said the agency is contesting the allegations and referred all inquiries to the former county attorney, who declined to comment.

Basile wasn’t cooperating with deputies as they processed his arrest on a disorderly intoxication misdemeanor on March 27, 2015, according to sheriff’s reports. Martin told internal affairs investigators that Basile was being verbally threatening to deputies during the booking process and that he held the prisoner from behind by his arms.

Martin claims Basile “horse stomped” on his foot and kicked him in his knee, which had just been surgically repaired. Then, in one swift move, the deputy slammed the man to the floor, face first.

A booking video showing the toss did not capture Basile’s alleged assault.

According to a sheriff’s report, Martin said he took Basile to the ground to “gain compliance.” He described the drunken man’s injuries as “a cut to his face.”

Basile was charged with battery on a police officer, a felony more serious than the intoxication charge for which he had been arrested by the Sarasota Police Department. He remained in jail for nearly five months, until Assistant State Attorney Rebekah Bragg reviewed the case.

During the internal investigation, Martin stated he did not mean to injure Basile during the takedown, but felt it was an appropriate response to being kicked by Basile. When questioned about other tactics that could have been used, which would not have caused injury, Martin said he did not consider other tactics.

Investigators determined there was sufficient information to sustain allegations of excessive force. Martin was suspended for 36 hours without pay, and retraining was ordered for the deputy.

Basile has been arrested 49 times since he moved to Florida in 1996. Some of the charges include marijuana possession, disorderly intoxication, drinking in public, weapons violations, battery, trespass and “lodging out of doors.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190506/outside-firm-may-represent-sarasota-deputy-accused-of-shattering-mans-face?rssfeed=true,2019-05-06T14:13:23Z,Sarasota Herald,Florida Man,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236
1183,A stroke averted: Innovative 3D model key in successful aneurysm surgery for William Golden Sr.,"William Jerome Golden Sr. tends to fill the room he enters. Well over 6 feet, finely-muscled, at 44 he looks like what he used to be, a basketball player at Godby High School. For the last 24 years he has worn the uniform of a manager at a Super Lube shop. Since 2005, when not running that store, he has managed to also develop what he calls his “entrepreneurial business,” Golden Touch Enterprises, doing home maintenance and landscaping.

No doubt about it, William Golden, a hard-worker and father of four, was a man going places, doing things, filling his future with plans. That is, until he almost had all of those plans cancelled by something deep inside his head.

Sitting in an office at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare on a recent Monday, Golden is holding something most people might find macabre. It is white, made of a kind of plastic, and is an exact replica of Golden’s lower skull, cervical vertebrae and curling blood vessels. He turns his “skull” over and over in his hands, quiet as he examines it, perhaps for a moment overcome with memories.

“That’s your head and that is the aneurysm that was repaired,” says Rob Fisher, RN, Neuroscience Service Line Administrator at TMH. Fisher has become a kind of ""lynchpin"" in TMH’s use of a dramatically new modality and how doctors and patients are able to visualize the body.

“This is exactly where the doctors were able to thread the stent,” says Fisher pointing to an enlarged section of a blood vessel lying near the base of Golden’s ‘skull.’ “And it’s all made through the use of 3D printing based on CT, MRIs, angiograms or PET scans of the patient.”

Buy Photo Rob Fisher, neuroscience service line administrator at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, explains the 3D model of William Golden Sr.'s skull, spine and brain aneurysm to him Tuesday, April 23, 2019. (Photo: Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat)

Severe headache symptoms

Prior to coming to Tallahassee, Rob Fisher had been doing international consulting, he says, working with Barts Hospital in London and an Irish company called, Axial. Axial was an innovative organization that had pioneered 3-D printed facsimiles of boney, vascular and soft tissue parts, as well as visualizing metallic appliances for use in complicated surgeries.

These ""real life"" models allow surgeons to turn their surgical sites any direction in their own hands, to know the anatomy from different angles before entering the body, and which are accurate, says Fisher, to 1/1000 millimeter. Fisher introduced the concept to the stroke team physicians at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare.

Back in 2017 William Golden had been having trouble with what he thought were sinus headaches. “I’d been to the Emergency Room several times,” he says. “The headaches were really bad… but sinus problems can hurt too.” An alert Emergency Room physician decided that there might be more to the repeat visits, and shortly, a CT scan revealed not an infected sinus cavity, but a dangerous cerebral aneurysm in Golden’s head.

Aneurysms come in a variety of types and are caused by a weakening of a blood vessel’s wall to make a bulge or distension. The most common aneurysm resembles “a berry” that hangs from a twig. Not all aneurysms require immediate intervention, but some do.

Buy Photo After suffering from headaches, William Golden Sr., 44, found out he had a brain aneurysm in August 2017. From then until January of this year, he worked with Dr. Lawson and others at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital for treatment.

Planning for surgery

Enter Dr. Matthew Lawson, a neurosurgeon and Stroke Medical Director at the Tallahassee Neurological Clinic and TMH. “Without intervention, Mr. Golden was at risk for two kinds of stroke — thrombotic and hemorrhagic. Based on the size and location of Golden’s aneurysm, it necessitated treatment.”



Using modern techniques that allow for intercranial repairs without externally entering the skull, Dr. Lawson threaded a catheter from William Golden’s groin into the vessels of his head. An angiogram was done, injecting dye to show on X-ray exactly the configuration of the vessels that would be treated.

But Dr. Lawson says the angiogram revealed something he hadn’t expected. This kind of aneurysm was different. Called a dissecting pseudoaneurysm, instead of the full thickness of the vessel bulging, here the inner wall had failed, and only thin connective tissue was keeping the entire vessel from hemorrhaging into the brain.

Dr. Lawson realized his plan for treating the problem with traditional aneurysm coiling was not going to be the best option.

For the moment, the surgery was halted and a new plan would be devised.

Rethinking the operation

Back in the TMH office, William Golden, still holding the 3D version of his skull, grows quiet, fighting back the emotions that overwhelm him as he remembers awakening to find he has not been made better; that he and his doctor would have to embark on a new and potentially more dangerous course of treatment.

Dr. Lawson too would pursue all the information he could gather. “I consulted with several surgeons around the country and though not usual, together it seemed that using a different kind of device called a ‘Pipeline’ stent would make sense.” Here, the stent would ‘by-pass’ and ‘wall-off’ the ruptured area allowing the aneurysm to clot and heal on its own.

For William Golden, the aborted surgery had given him pause and it took a while for him to conclude that he would undergo the second attempt at his aneurysm’s repair. “I had faith in Dr. Lawson,” he says now. “I appreciated that he took the time to do it the right way and not take risks.”

From Lawson’s point of view, he says that, “For surgeons, these 3D replicas are helpful in seeing the exact curvature of blood vessels, their proximity to other brain structures, and importantly, to explain clearly to patients what is involved.”

Faith and success

The second surgery was performed. Golden says he leaned on his faith — and his trust in his doctors. The second surgery was a success.

Today, as William Golden readies to get a bite of lunch and get back to Super Lube duties, he looks the picture of health. His doctor tells him that his risk for stroke is “close to zero.” Untreated, it would have remained “very high.”

He will stay on blood pressure medication and be monitored for the next four years. Promising to watch his diet and follow a healthy lifestyle, he smiles that he has gained back the 20 pounds he had lost during his ordeal. And that seems just fine.

Golden softly jokes that he just wasn’t “ready to go yet.” But watching him handle the 3-D version of his own head and how he buries his brow in his hands remembering his journey with Dr. Lawson and the TMH Stroke Team, the depth of his gratitude is quietly and powerfully revealed. And the Team says it is only glad to be there for patients like Golden — a man with things to do!

1184,Deion Sanders' long-awaited return to Fort Myers leads to reconciliation and apology,"CLOSE Deion Sanders, a North Fort Myers High School graduate, shares portions of his life story with the community on Saturday at Fort Myers High School. Kinfay Moroti, The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA

Deion Sanders' return to Fort Myers Saturday was an effort at reconciliation with his hometown.

The two-time Super Bowl winner and World Series player was awarded a key to the city during a community forum Saturday night at Fort Myers High School.

The relationship between Sanders, 51, and the city he grew up in has been a rocky one. It included failed business proposals like a 2005 attempt to build affordable housing where it's needed the most and an arrest for trespassing and fishing on a private lake near Southwest Florida International Airport.

But on Saturday night, all of that appeared to be forgotten as Sanders was welcomed on stage with a standing ovation with audience members cheering loudly for him.

""You are indeed a hometown hero,"" said Fort Myers Mayor Randy Henderson.

The event was attended by about 150 people and their recognition of Sanders prompted the NFL Hall of Famer, known as Prime Time, to apologize to his childhood city.

""This is long overdue. This is like a reconciliation for me,"" Sanders said. ""The reason it hurt so bad was because I don't give a damn what they say about me in Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York,"" Sanders said. ""I don't care because it was my job ... When you talk about me, some things I let slide, but you are all family. You only get one shot at calling the place home.""

""Thank you from the bottom of my heart,"" Sanders said. ""God was saying reconciliation. This has been reconciliation and a spirit of peace since I got here.""

""I apologize to you as well. You have no idea what you all did to me this particular weekend. The best is yet to come.""

For his return, Sanders brought with him Dallas-area Pastor Omar Jahwar to hold Prime's Community Correction, an intelligence gathering forum meant to understand the problems that the city of Fort Myers faces. On Sunday, Sanders was set to host his Prime Elite Underclassmen Camp for local athletes at Bishop Verot High School.

The Saturday night talk was a fact-finding mission but included little details on how to help the city. Sanders promised to return.

Violence, poverty, lack of opportunity are some of the factors that lead to violence in a community, Jahwar said.

""Social civility is available to young people even when they don't understand it,"" Jahwar said. ""Violence becomes the language of those who are underserved.""

Jahwar mentored Antong Lucky, founder and former leader of the Dallas 415 Bloods gang, and the two are now part of Urban Specialists, a group that looks to use the experience of former gang members as the best way to keep others from that life.

""The key thing for us to do, especially people who are trying to help, is to listen,"" Lucky said. ""You've got to hear what people want without judging them.""

Lucky said violence, drug dealing and gangs become part of the equation because of proximity. It's what they see in their community, Lucky said, and it's a cycle that continues.

Unless you are Sanders.

Sanders grew up in Dunbar, but at an early age said he would stay away from drugs and alcohol to remain focused on sports and school.

""I am only up here right now because I had a plan,"" Sanders said. ""I did not allow anyone out there to affect my plan.""

Sanders was almost brought to tears when he spoke about his mom, Connie Knight, and the long work hours she put in at Lee Memorial Hospital.

Sanders also thanked her for exposing him to life outside of his neighborhood. He said she would take the North Fort Myers High School graduate for drives down McGregor Boulevard and to Naples. The exposure to a different life showed him what was possible.

""I was exposed to so much that I had a choice so I didn’t fall prey,"" he said. ""I had seen another way. That influence changed my life.""

Henderson said Sanders' ""message quite frankly was one of the most powerful messages I have witnessed in my adult life.""

His apology was an ""outward demonstration"" of his character.

""I'm not sure that was necessary, but he felt that was necessary and that's what I respect and I honor that,"" Henderson said.

For Lehigh Senior High football coach James Chaney, it was good for his students to have the benefit of seeing Sanders talk about his accomplishments. Chaney also played with Sanders at North Fort Myers and at Florida State University.

Chaney said he was grateful for Sanders' return and the past should remain in the past.

But, he said, it's important to remember there are men in Dunbar and Fort Myers who are working to make change for others.

""I don't ever want to discount what the average man has done for our kids,"" Chaney said. ""You don't have to be a NFL player to give back and I feel (Sanders) feels that, too.""

Earnest Graham, football coach at Evangelical Christian School and former NFL player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said Sanders appears to be ""a man of purpose"" and will get things done.

Fort Myers councilwoman Terolyn Watson is hoping the city and Sanders can move forward and facilitate the changes that are needed.

""I think Deion's main message tonight is the choices you make in life can make a difference,"" Watson said. ""He's one of our most successful people. He has a great story. He's a great role model.""

Darrell Rowe, 14, was excited to see Sanders in person. He plays football and basketball and participates in track.

""He's someone I can look up to, someone who made it out,"" the Oak Hammock Middle School student said. ""I can do the same thing and I can make it out.""

SEFFNER, Fla. (WFLA) – A man was arrested after a two hour standoff with deputies and SWAT that ended peacefully in Seffner Friday night.

According to the sheriff’s office, a tip led deputies to the Wigwam RV Park, located at 9201 Williams Rod, around 6:30 p.m.

William Swint, 27, a man who had active felony warrants, was found hiding inside a small camper in the trailer park.

Swint barricaded himself in the camper when deputies made contact with him and he refused to surrender.

SWAT negotiators worked with Swint for nearly two hours to convince him to surrender.

Gas was deployed inside the camper.

Swint climbed onto the roof, refusing to surrender.

A less-lethal weapon was deployed and SWAT deputies seized and handcuffed Swint.

Swint is being checked out at Tampa General Hospital and will be taken to jail.

1188,Man killed during internet cafe robbery was US Marine,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The girlfriend of a man who was shot while trying to thwart a robbery at a Jacksonville internet cafe is praying for a quick arrest.

Lisa Fighter said her boyfriend, Douglas Cox, a U.S. Marine, did what he could to save a life, but lost his own life in the process. She said Cox was killed while trying to stop an armed robber Wednesday evening at the Dream Arcade on Edgewood Avenue.

""He's gone,"" Fighter said. ""He isn't going to make anybody laugh or smile or giggle anymore.""

Fighter relived the moment she learned what happened.

""We (were) going to McDonald's and we came across and saw the cops and our friends' SUV that they were in,"" Fighter said. ""He just looked at me and I could tell. I hit my knees and he said he was gone. There's nothing more that could be done.""

Cox, 47, was a regular at the Dream Arcade. Barry Jackson was there on the night of the shooting and called his friend's actions heroic.

""They were going to go in there and kill that woman, and he jumped in,"" Jackson said. ""Got the bullet before she did.""

According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, only one employee was inside the internet cafe at the time and no one else was injured.

""He died doing what he believed in,"" Fighter said.

The deadly shooting is one recent example in a string of violence at Jacksonville internet cafes. Early Friday morning, the Wilson Arcade on Wilson Boulevard was robbed by two masked gunmen.

As of Thursday night, no arrests were announced. Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 904-630-0500 or email JSOCrimeTips@jaxsheriff.org. To remain anonymous, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-866-845-TIPS (8477).

Last month, Aguirre's lawyers were back in court asking for state money after his murder conviction was set aside.

Aguirre was originally convicted of killing two Altamonte Springs women in 2004. The Florida Supreme Court set the conviction aside in 2016 and ordered a new trial.

The state first said it would retry the case, but then decided to drop it last November.

The state opposed the request for an estimated $700,000, saying the defense needed to file for the payment within 90 days of the court setting aside his original conviction.

The defense argued back, saying since the state planned a new trial for Aguirre, and he had to stay behind bars during that time, the 90 days shouldn't start until his actual release.

In his ruling, Judge John Galluzzo wrote, ""Mr. Aguirre had everything necessary to file the petition --"" once his conviction was set aside.

Galluzzo said, ""Mr. Aguirre's petition was filed well beyond the 90 days.""

The state attorney said in a written statement that the judge followed the law, and that only the legislature can extend the time for filing a claim, not a judge.

1193,Person of interest sought in drive-by after gunfire narrowly...,"ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. - The morning after drive-by bullets barely missed a child on a couch in a West Augustine home, a man was spotted walking through a nearby apartment complex openly carrying a gun, investigators said.

They need to know who that man is.

Surveillance video showed the man ""brazenly"" walking through the complex with the handgun and then putting the gun inside a vehicle parked at the complex, according to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office.

Investigators said the owner of the car refused to allow a voluntary search, but after they got a warrant, they found a 9mm Glock pistol with a 33-round extended magazine (pictured) hidden under the front seat.

They said the gun was reported stolen in Jacksonville earlier this year.

Deputies think the man seen in the surveillance video may be connected to an incident overnight Monday on Scheidel Way that sent bullets flying into a home.

Several bullet holes were found in the home and shell casings were found outside, deputies said.

Multiple rounds hit a couch inside the home, narrowly missing a 9-year-old. Multiple young children were inside the home, including a 1-year-old, deputies said.

""They found nine shots outside, six inside and two shots that hit the couch where my grandson was laying,"" homeowner Leslie Harden told News4Jax. ""For a grandmother, that's a lot.""

""You know, I just want to grab my grandson and hug him. Thank God he was all right,"" she added.

Harden had words for whoever pulled the trigger.

""Why would you do this?"" she said. ""You could have killed an innocent child.""

Anyone who might have been in the area between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m. Monday and saw anything suspicious, including vehicles or people, is asked to contact detectives at 1-888-277-TIPS (8477) or tips@sjso.org. You can remain anonymous and could be eligible for a $5,000 reward if the information provided leads to an arrest.

""If you know something or saw something, say something,"" said Sheriff's Office spokesperson Chuck Mulligan.

Detectives think the man in the surveillance video could be from Duval or St. Johns counties because the gun he was carrying was stolen from Duval County and the owner of the car he left the gun in currently lives in Duval County.

Anyone who might know the man's identity is asked to call Detective Jon Dees with the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office Major Crimes Unit at 904-209-2130 or if you would like to remain anonymous and be eligible for a reward, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-888-277-TIPS (8477) or TIPS@SJSO.ORG. Reward eligibility for information leading to an arrest is up to $5,000.

1194,Police: Woman stops to help jogger when suspicious stranger approaches,"LAKE CITY, Fla. - A Lake City woman is being praised for spotting what might have been a dangerous situation for a female jogger and stepping in to help.

The woman said she saw a man driving a pickup truck slow down next to the jogger, who was running on the sidewalk along Southwest McLane Avenue.

The woman said when the man pulled off to the side of the road, she slowed down to keep an eye on things. The man then got out of the truck and approached the jogger.

The man was described as an older white male in his mid-40s to early 50s, wearing a dark ball cap and blue jeans.

When the woman saw him approaching the jogger, she honked and called the jogger over to ask if she knew the man and make sure everything was OK. The jogger said she didn't know him and thanked the woman for stopping.

While they were talking, the man got back in his truck and drove away.

The woman stayed with the jogger until the truck had driven out of sight.

“It is of the utmost importance to be aware of our surroundings,” said Dr. Argatha Gilmore, chief of police for Lake City. “Assisting fellow citizens in this manner is how we keep our community safe. If you see something, say something.”

1202,Jury to decide life or death in murder case of Derrick Thompson,"PANAMA CITY - A jury will decide whether Derrick Thompson will get life without parole or the death penalty for the 2014 murder of Allen Johnson.

Thompson was found guilty Friday of 1st degree murder and robbery with a firearm for the killing of Johnson, a friend, to get money to finance an addiction to prescription pills. The penalty phase began Monday and continues Tuesday.

Witnesses were called by the prosecution and defense. Jordan Limmer, Johnson’s niece, cried when reading a statement about how her uncle was kind and generous, including helping with her horse riding hobby when she was young.

“It’s about what he still means to us and has done for all of us. Uncle Allen was present throughout all of my childhood,” said Limmer. “He made games for each kid because he knew we were all different but his to love. ... I won’t be able to call him anymore and tell him how thankful I am.”

Carolyn Thompson, Thompson’s mother, was called to the stand to talk about her son. Photos of Thompson from his childhood, service in the Army National Guard and with family were shown.

“It’s very close,” said Carolyn Thompson of her relationship with her son. “He had a normal childhood. ... He was president (of the FFA). He had a good relationship with his dad. They hunted and fished.”

Others who testified said Thompson is a religious man, didn’t have a disciplinary track record in prison. He took prescription medication after injuring his back, they said, and his personality changed in his addiction.

Monday's testimony also mentioned Thompson was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder in Santa Rosa County for the separate murders of Milton residents Steven Zackowski, 60, and Debra Zackowski, 59, shortly before Johnson was killed. Thompson was sentenced to life without parole in that case and those murders weren’t mentioned during the latest trial.

This is the first death penalty case to go to trial in Bay County since the revamping of capital punishment in Florida. The 12-person jury will now need to unanimously return a verdict in favor of the death penalty for the sentence to be imposed.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190506/jury-to-decide-life-or-death-in-murder-case-of-derrick-thompson?rssfeed=true,2019-05-06T18:20:00Z,Panama City News Herald,Florida Man,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
1205,"Like it or not, the Electoral College is here to stay: your say","0504 Cartoon (Photo: Rick McKee, The Augusta Chronicle, GA)

Here to stay

I see a lot lately about abolishing the Electoral College but this would require a massive rewrite of article II of the Constitution in an amendment and I doubt you would ever get enough small states to go along.

The reality is the ""popular vote"" has absolutely no significance in the constitutional process of choosing a president. Voting at the citizen level is not even mentioned. It is only state law that gives you any vote at all because the Constitution simply says electors will be appointed by the state legislatures ""in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct"". They could have a lottery if they wanted to. I bet that would surprise a lot of people.

It sometimes amazes me how many people have never actually read the Constitution. On top of that there is really no guarantee that the electors will actually vote the way the legislature told them to. Some elections have ""rogue"" electors.

Since all of this requires that two-thirds of Congress would vote yes and the legislatures of 38 states ratify. None of the small states would, simply because it would effectively take them out of the process of electing a president.

Love it or hate it, the Electoral College is here to stay. In fact, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see a circumstance when the left would want to have it if migration trends stay the way they are.

Since WWII, we’ve been the go-to country for support during crises. Our presence has prevented the wholesale takeover of countries by rogue nations and terror groups. We were the model to emulate.

Today, our reputation is at an all-time low. Dictators feel free to behave badly because Trump admires them. We no longer step in to help keep the world safer and saner. We haven’t always been right and some countries have a right to be angry with us, but we were still better than whatever was in second place.

Our president likes to be “unpredictable” and he behaves on impulse. Even when he stays with a position, it is destructive, such as his blind allegiance to a wall that will not solve the immigration issue.

When Donald Trump leaves, we will need a president who will help regain our credibility. Even if everything he or she does is welcome and healing, we will not be trusted for many years. The world will say, yes, they’re doing good things now, but that may only last until the next election. What is to stop them from again electing an incompetent, destructive fool with a mental problem? That is Trump’s legacy.

Lock thoughts

This morning, I am looking at 14 vessels waiting in line to go through the Chiquita lock. Why doesn't the lock master, or whomever has the keys to the kingdom, open the lock for 10 to 15 minutes and let the boaters pass through unimpeded?

I'm sure the canal system won't drain completely out in these short burst of common sense.

Education matters

In a recent Mailbag, a writer asked: Shouldn’t there be an age limit on paying school taxes? Shouldn’t there be a limit on what you are compelled to pay? Why aren’t the people who are causing the need for more schools be [sic] obliged to pay for them?

Well, John Adams wrote, “The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the expense of it.” Thomas Jefferson warned, “The tax which will be paid for this purpose is not more than the thousandth part of what will be paid to kings, priests and nobles who will rise up among us if we leave the people in ignorance.”

Certainly taxes collected and money paid out should fall under scrutiny, but careful scrutiny requires an educated electorate. If education is provided only to those who can afford it, we will create the very type of system from which we achieved our independence.

I wonder if people realize that each time they pick up a phone or goes somewhere for goods, services, medical attention, and virtually every other type of attention, they are interacting with products of our public education system.

Unnecessary encroachment

Yesterday evening, I had been looking forward to a repeat broadcast of Life, Liberty and Levin after missing it the first time. In fact, I had been waiting the whole week for that because so many people had told me how outstanding Mark Levin had been when it first aired. I was shocked to see that a second hour of coverage of the shooting in a California synagogue was underway.

Don't misunderstand me. The shooting, in which one person was killed, was horrible and could only have proceeded from a sick and evil mind. That is not the point, which is simply that all the facts about the shooting which were known or could have been known at that time could have been accurately stated in less than 10 minutes and Levin's fans, including myself, would not have been disappointed. Had additional important facts been uncovered that could have been reported at the bottom of the screen or during a quick short interruption.

This long, drawn-out, repetitive, uninformative and totally boring overcoverage was an unnecessary encroachment on viewers' time and patience.

Held accountable

As I watch TV and see all the immigrants trying to enter our country, men, women and children there are things they all have in common: most don't speak English, they are all very poor (the cartels got any money they may have had), most need medical attention, most are young and uneducated and the children are in bad shape.

Who do you think will pay for all the government services these illegal immigrants will require, billions and billions of our hard-earned taxes? Meanwhile, we have so many problems in this country where all that money could be spent.

I say let them make their application to enter and then return to Mexico until their case is heard. While all of this is going on, the socialist Democrats refuse to act, they are a disgrace and will be held accountable in the 2020 election.

See light

The best light by far is daylight. Sending our youngsters out before daylight is ludicrous. Folks can see much better driving in daylight than darkness. Even if we pay a fortune to light up the bus stops, the youngsters still have to get there alive.

If a politician or a school official tells you to send your youngster out before daylight, fire them. They are putting your youngster in harm's way so a few businesses can make an extra dollar serving patrons another hour in the evening.

A little artificial light or daylight, take your pick, its your choice.

1206,Putting the honor in Honor Flight: Veterans greeted and feted to D.C. and back,"As a hospice patient with lung cancer and a grim prognosis from doctors, Philip Keenly wasn’t an ideal candidate to make the Collier-Lee Honor Flight trip to Washington, D.C., on Saturday.

The group’s volunteer medical staff debated whether to allow him on the trip or assign him to the less taxing Honor at Home ceremonies planned on the same day at Southwest Florida International Airport.

CLOSE Southwest Florida veterans participated Saturday, May 4, 2019, in the Collier-Lee Honor Flight from Fort Myers to Washington, D.C. Brent Batten, brent.batten@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4776

In the end, they decided with some special accommodations, Keenly could go.

His determination to see the monuments to him and his fellow veterans played into the decision.

“I’m a patriot and I feel very strongly about this country. I went through quite a goddam lot to be here. I’ve never seen it (the Korean War Veterans Memorial). I want to see that our story was told,” said Keenly, one of 86 veterans — the largest contingent in group history — who made the daylong trip on a charter plane to view the war memorials in the nation’s capital.

Eighty-six veterans, 86 stories.

Buy Photo World War II veteran Edwin McQuiston surveys graves at Arlington National Cemetery on Saturday, May 4, 2019. (Photo: Brent Batten/Naples Daily News)

Keenly enlisted in the Marines while still in high school, right after the Korean War broke out.

A rifleman, he took part in the battle at the Chosin Reservoir, notorious for the bitter cold the Marines endured.

“I couldn’t tell you how many guys came back with black feet,” Keenly said, describing the effects of frostbite.

Wounded with shrapnel, he was out of action for 10 days.

“It could have been a helluva lot worse,” he said.

Stories like that of Bob Naum, a B-17 navigator based in England who flew 29 missions over western Europe during World War II. When not plotting a course with a sextant, pencil and paper, he manned a gun fending off German fighters. “I don’t think I ever knocked one down, but I shot a lot of shells at them,” Naum said.

He spent his 96th birthday Saturday in fine style, dancing to big band music and receiving kisses from Andrews Sisters lookalikes near the World War II Memorial.

All his squadron mates are gone, Naum said. “There must be something else someone wants me to do,” he said explaining his longevity.

“It was fantastic,” Naum said near the end of the 20-hour trip.

Or that of James Flanagan, 95. A Marine, Flanagan was learning to fly a dive bomber in preparation for the invasion of Japan when the war ended with the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “President Truman was nice enough to end the war,” Flanagan said.

He’s been to the World War II Memorial before, but never with a group of fellow veterans. “It brings it home now, more than then,” Flanagan said. “You realize what the service people did.”

There was Norma Jock, one of two female veterans on the trip and a Navy recruiter in New York City during the Vietnam War. She never served in Vietnam but being a recruiter in that era carried its own dangers, she recalled. “They blew up (a recruiting station) in the Bronx. They blew up one in Times Square,” she said.

And Joseph Lipps, who served with the Army’s 34th Engineers at the height of the Vietnam War.

Nearly blind, an impairment Lipps attributes to exposure to Agent Orange, although the government hasn’t acknowledged that, Lipps carried with him the names of 25 fallen comrades.

Honor Flight volunteers made pencil etchings of the names from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall and gave them to Lipps, so he can look at them up close under better light at home.

“I wasn’t expecting that,” Lipps said.

There were somber moments on the trip, to be sure. “It’s an emotional roller coaster,” said Rafael Lopez, one of the organizers.

“If you don’t well up with emotion on that sort of thing, you never will,” said Naples resident and Korean War era veteran Ray Nugent, leaving the changing of the guard ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.

But mostly, the mood was festive.

Arriving at Reagan National Airport the veterans and the volunteer guardians accompanying them were greeted by the 32-piece Falls Church, Va., concert band and well-wishers, some volunteers with Honor Flight in Washington, D.C., some simply travelers who walked over from their gates to shake a veteran’s hand and say, “Thank you.”

“That was a wonderful reception. I was in tears. It was just overwhelming, said Army veteran Theodore Cadieu. Although never in combat, some considered Cadieu the most important man in his unit. He was in charge of making sure everyone got paid.

He summed up what many feel about their military service.

“I got a life-changing experience from it. It instilled discipline in me, responsibility. It showed me I can be useful,” he said.

Throughout the day, spontaneous corridors of park visitors would form to thank the Honor Flight group as it made its way around the monuments.

Arriving back at Southwest Florida International, there was an even bigger welcome awaiting veterans.

Organizers estimate 3,000 people, the largest welcoming committee in the group’s six-year history, lined the terminal to shake hands and thank the veterans for their service. There were bands, JROTC units, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, veterans’ groups, costumed military personnel from different eras, flag-waving families and people with no affiliation other than to just thank a veteran.

“Don’t you dare write that I cried,” Nugent said making his way through the phalanx of greeters.

The number of World War II and Korean War veterans is dwindling. “History is leaving us quickly,” Honor Flight media coordinator Rick Wobbe said.

This trip, the local group’s 19th, included 15 veterans from World War II and 34 from Korea.

As the trend continues, the group will bring in Vietnam and Cold War era veterans take their place.

Chartering a plane costs about $130,000, gathered through donations. Storm Smart Shutters contributed $80,000 toward Mission 19.

The next trip is planned in September.

1207,Pit bull recovering after being dragged by truck in Spring Hill,"Pit bull recovering after being dragged by truck in Spring Hill Video

Spring Hill, FLA - HERNANDO COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - A young pit bull is recovering after he was allegedly dragged by a rope that was tied to the back of a pickup truck bumper, witnesses told News Channel 8.

It happened at the intersection of Northcliffe Boulevard and Franconia Avenue in Spring Hill on Friday morning.

Jan Harwood, the owner of Nature Coast Animal Wellness and Surgery Center in Weeki Wachee, said she watched as the dog was dragged by a truck that was going 30 to 40 miles per hour, and hurled onto the road.

Harwood and another man in a van pulled over as the driver of the truck drove away.

She said the pit bull, which she named ""Ollie,"" had severe road rash all over his body. The pads of his feet were worn off.

Harwood said the van owner brought the injured dog to her clinic, which is just up the highway and a veterinarian performed X-rays and ultrasounds. The vet said Ollie had no broken bones or internal injuries, which is amazing, considering the traumatic incident he had just been through.

1208,Retired NFL star Deion Sanders' long-awaited return to Fort Myers leads to reconciliation,"CLOSE Deion Sanders, a North Fort Myers High School graduate, shares portions of his life story with the community on Saturday at Fort Myers High School. Kinfay Moroti, The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA

Deion Sanders' return to Fort Myers on Saturday was an effort at reconciliation with his hometown.

The two-time Super Bowl winner and World Series player was awarded a key to the city during a community forum Saturday night at Fort Myers High School.

The relationship between Sanders, 51, and the city he grew up in has been a rocky one. It included failed business proposals such as a 2005 attempt to build affordable housing where it's needed the most and an arrest for trespassing and fishing on a private lake near Southwest Florida International Airport.

But on Saturday night, all of that appeared to be forgotten as Sanders was welcomed on stage with a standing ovation with audience members cheering loudly for him.

""You are indeed a hometown hero,"" said Fort Myers Mayor Randy Henderson.

The event was attended by about 150 people, and their recognition of Sanders prompted the Pro Football Hall of Fame member, known as ""Prime Time,"" to apologize to his childhood city.

""This is long overdue. This is like a reconciliation for me,"" Sanders said. ""The reason it hurt so bad was because I don't give a damn what they say about me in Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York,"" Sanders said. ""I don't care because it was my job. ... When you talk about me, some things I let slide, but you are all family. You only get one shot at calling the place home.""

""Thank you from the bottom of my heart,"" Sanders said. ""God was saying reconciliation. This has been reconciliation and a spirit of peace since I got here.""

""I apologize to you as well. You have no idea what you all did to me this particular weekend. The best is yet to come.""

For his return, Sanders brought with him Dallas-area Pastor Omar Jahwar to hold Prime's Community Correction, a forum meant to understand the problems that Fort Myers faces. On Sunday, Sanders was set to host his Prime Elite Underclassmen Camp for local athletes at Bishop Verot High School.

The Saturday night talk was a fact-finding mission but included few details on how to help the city. Sanders promised to return.

Violence, poverty and lack of opportunity are some of the factors that lead to violence in a community, Jahwar said.

""Social civility is available to young people even when they don't understand it,"" Jahwar said. ""Violence becomes the language of those who are underserved.""

Jahwar mentored Antong Lucky, founder and former leader of the Dallas 415 Bloods gang, and the two are now part of Urban Specialists, a group that looks to use the experience of former gang members as the best way to keep others from that life.

""The key thing for us to do, especially people who are trying to help, is to listen,"" Lucky said. ""You've got to hear what people want without judging them.""

Lucky said violence, drug dealing and gangs become part of the equation because of proximity. It's what they see in their community, Lucky said, and it's a cycle that continues.

However, Sanders didn't get caught up in it. Sanders grew up in Dunbar but at an early age said he would stay away from drugs and alcohol to remain focused on sports and school.

""I am only up here right now because I had a plan,"" Sanders said. ""I did not allow anyone out there to affect my plan.""

Sanders was almost brought to tears when he spoke about his mom, Connie Knight, and the long work hours she put in at Lee Memorial Hospital.

Sanders also thanked her for exposing him to life outside his neighborhood. He said she would take the North Fort Myers High School graduate for drives down McGregor Boulevard and to Naples. The exposure to a different life showed him what was possible.

""I was exposed to so much that I had a choice so I didn’t fall prey,"" he said. ""I had seen another way. That influence changed my life.""

Henderson said Sanders' ""message quite frankly was one of the most powerful messages I have witnessed in my adult life.""

His apology was an ""outward demonstration"" of his character.

""I'm not sure that was necessary, but he felt that was necessary and that's what I respect and I honor that,"" Henderson said.

Lehigh High School football coach James Chaney, who played with Sanders at North Fort Myers and Florida State University, said it was good for his team to hear Sanders talk about his accomplishments.

Chaney said he was grateful for Sanders' return and the past should remain in the past.

But he said it's important to remember there are men in Dunbar and Fort Myers who are working to make change for others.

""I don't ever want to discount what the average man has done for our kids,"" Chaney said. ""You don't have to be a NFL player to give back, and I feel (Sanders) feels that, too.""

Earnest Graham, football coach at Evangelical Christian School and a former NFL player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said Sanders appears to be ""a man of purpose"" and will get things done.

Fort Myers Councilwoman Terolyn Watson is hoping the city and Sanders can move forward and facilitate changes that are needed.

""I think Deion's main message tonight is the choices you make in life can make a difference,"" Watson said. ""He's one of our most successful people. He has a great story. He's a great role model.""

Darrell Rowe, 14, was excited to see Sanders in person. He plays football and basketball and participates in track.

""He's someone I can look up to, someone who made it out,"" the Oak Hammock Middle School student said. ""I can do the same thing and I can make it out.""

1210,"After 90 years, greyhound racing comes to an end in Sarasota","Florida voters decided to abolish live greyhound racing by the end of 2020. The Sarasota Kennel Club is stopping a year early.

SARASOTA — Airplanes will still rumble overhead as they take off at Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport. Cars and trucks will still whoosh by. The buses will still groan as they stop in front of the Sarasota Kennel Club.

But after this weekend, the sounds along Bradenton Road and University Parkway will never be the same.

That’s because the dogs are going away.

That means no more crescendo of barks as the lean greyhounds are led from the kennel to the track.

That means no more bugle call.

“Swifty,” the mechanical rabbit that leads the dogs to the finish line, will be gone, too. So will the sound of those guys leaning against the wire fence — the guys who yell, “Come on four, get back on it. Get in there four.”

Perhaps that’s what led Jean McCormick and thousands of others to the Sarasota Kennel Club on Saturday. It was a chance to place one last bet and take in the end of a Sarasota tradition since 1929.

Saturday was like the old days, McCormick said with a smile, back when she fell in love with Dan, who later became her husband. Back before the lottery, when the ladies wore peacock hats and lined the fence, hands clutching betting slips or beer cans or both.

McCormick worked the concession stand for 23 years. She loved the characters. The heavy-betters, the rugged greyhound trainers, even the unique personality of each dog.

Before the first race kicked off at 12:30 p.m., McCormick sat at the table closest to the kennels. She wanted to watch them as they pulled the gangly teenage handlers to the track, “hungry for a run.”

The memories, she said, were too powerful to describe.

She hadn’t been back since Dan died in 2006. She left soon after, moving to Port Charlotte.

“I think the heart of this today are the people that made this place special,” said McCormick, nodding toward a tall man flanked by TV cameras near the track.

That’s Tom Bowersox, 74, he’s director of racing operations. He’s been here a long time.

In front of the cameras, he talked about the decision voters made in November that put racing in Florida on its last legs.

He talked about the Collins family, who have operated the track since 1944, and their decision to end things before the 2020 deadline.

Later, in his office, Bowersox, who has worked for the Collins family for 58 years, doing “every job you can imagine,” talked about the layoffs. Hundreds of layoffs. Bowersox thinks he’ll stick around for a little while longer.

It’s hard to say how many at the Sarasota Kennel Club at this point, he said.

“Just know that for many of us, it’s the only job we’ve ever known,” Bowersox said.

The industry has operated in the state for almost a century but has dwindled to 11 tracks. Outside of Florida, just six greyhound tracks in five U.S. states remain.

Experts in the industry anticipate 3,000 lost jobs statewide, 5,000 to 8,000 greyhounds who need homes and $11 million in lost revenue to the state once racing ends.

After this weekend, the club plans on expanding its popular poker room, possibly moving to a more central location in Sarasota County, and hopes to add sports gambling, should it become legal in Florida.

Many of the dogs have already been shipped to tracks and kennels in the Panhandle.

“If you want to know the heart and the people most affected by this change,” Bowersox said, ""you need to talk to Deb.”

Everybody from Sarasota to Ebro, a small town outside of Panama City, knows Deb Linn. It’s the bright, goldfish-colored shirts she wears. It’s the baseball caps she sports to keep her blonde hair out of her eyes. It’s the Wisconsin accent she can’t seem to shake.

Shortly after high school, the 50-year-old owner of De-N-De, a kennel business, fell in love with greyhound racing. It was the dogs.

She loved it so much that 28 years ago, she wrestled the money to start her own business. For Linn, it’s not a job. It’s a lifestyle. No health care, pension or retirement plan. All she makes goes into the dogs.

But that’s about to change.

Linn has to junk or donate everything. The trailers, the kennels, the medicine. The dogs, which she helped train since they were 14 months old, will have to go, too.

“I haven’t cried yet because I’ve been way too busy preparing for the end,” Linn said. “I think the day it will hit me is the day I wake up to the sound of silence. No barking, no playing, no goofy greyhound stuff.”

The Collins family had no plans Saturday to address the more than 7,000 spectators after the final race. There would be no commencement or big send-off, said Chris Collins, 53, the grandson of Jerry Collins, the man who took the track over in 1944.

The family would relax and let every one soak in the finish.

“But for me, the eerie thing will be coming out here on a Friday night, and hearing nothing but silence,” Collins said. “It’s going to be quiet.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190504/after-90-years-greyhound-racing-comes-to-end-in-sarasota?rssfeed=true,2019-05-04T18:44:14Z,Sarasota Herald,Florida Man,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) –

Interstate 275 was closed southbound for hours following a fatal motorcycle crash Friday night.

The crash occurred near mile marker 23, near the 5th Avenue North exit.

The Florida Highway Patrol reports a 27-year-old man was attempting to pass two vehicles near mile marker 23 and lost control of his motorcycle and collided with the first vehicle.

The motorcyclist was then overrun by the second vehicle. The motorcyclist was taken to Bayfront Hospital as a trauma alert where he later died from his injuries.

1213,Videos show deputies in action in Monroe County,"<p>On a Sunday evening in March, Monroe County Sheriff's Office deputies rushed to a house in Key Largo after receiving a 911 call about a medical emergency there.</p>

<p>By time deputies arrived, they heard a man yelling for help. The woman inside ""had no pulse, was not breathing, and her face was blue,"" deputies reported.</p>

<p>""She had a pulse... she's going back down,"" one deputy said on body camera video.</p>

<p>After performing CPR and placing automated external defibrillator (AED) pads on the woman, both deputies on scene administered Narcan, the medication used to reverse opioid overdose.</p>

<p>In minutes, the woman regained a heartbeat and began breathing on her own.</p>

<p>That night was one of many that sticks with Deputy Ignacio Molina, one of the deputies who helped save her life.</p>

<p>Molina, deployed five times with the Marines and now working in the Sheriff's Office Upper Keys unit, said calls in the Keys range from drug and alcohol related crimes, crashes, property crimes, to the occasional violent incident.</p>

<p>""Drunk driving is a big, big thing here,"" Molina said.</p>

<p>On a night a Local 10 crew rode with Molina, during his 6p.m. to 6a.m. shift, Molina pulled over a car speeding on the Overseas Highway. He said he smelled marijuana in the car and asked to search the driver's bag, where he found suspected joints.</p>

<p>""There it is - positive for marijuana,"" Molina said after performing a field test on the substance.</p>

<p>He let the driver go with a notice to appear.</p>

<p>In the course of the night, Molina also pulled over a swerving car, which ended up being full of lost tourists. He pulled over a man on a golf cart illegally driving on the pedestrian path along U.S. 1, who had a suspended license and a warrant, according to records.</p>

<p>He also deftly dealt with a tourist at a swanky resort, suspected of being unruly and drunk. Molina convinced him to go back to his room and order food.</p>

<p>And around midnight, he stopped a man on a bicycle with a chainsaw that was suspected to be stolen property. But saving lives, like on that night in March, is one of a law enforcement officer's most important jobs.</p>

<p>Deputies in the Keys have been carrying Narcan for the last two years, according to a department spokesman. School Resource Officers now carry the potent drug as well.</p>

<p>""It feels good. It gives you a sense of:  'this is why I do the job.'"" Molina said.</p>

<p>Saravia and Susana Duron said they were walking in the neighborhood's popular area of Second Avenue at 24th Street when a group of men started to harass them. They had picked up some pizza, so after cat-calling, one asked for a slice. </p>

<p>""The moment I spoke up, he struck me,"" Saravia said, adding that she had never seen the man before. ""He split my lip. I got 7 to 10 stitches from the inside out. I'm missing teeth on top and I have loose teeth on the bottom."" </p>

<p>The men struck Saravia several times in the head. She suffered a mild concussion. Duron punched one of them, and he pushed her to the ground. Although her head hit concrete, she wasn't injured. A man who was part of the group tried to stop the attackers but it was too late. </p>

<p>Saravia called 911, and the guys started to scatter and drove away. She tried to take a picture of one of their license plates, but one of the guys blocked her. They reported them to the Miami Police Department and detectives are searching for the attackers.</p>

TAIWAN (KRON) - Who knew Apple products had such... resiliency?

A Taiwanese man was surprised to learn one of the Apple AirPods he accidentally swallowed still worked, even after he had to pass the device through his system, and salvage it from the toilet.

Ben Hsu reportedly fell asleep with the Airpods in his ears and woke up realizing his right Airpod was missing.

Using the tracking feature on the device to locate it, he heard a beeping sound coming from his stomach, the publication reports.

Hsu then went to the hospital where an x-ray confirmed the missing AirPod was located in his stomach.

The doctor gave Hsu some laxatives and two days later, he passed the AirPod through his digestive system and was reunited with the missing earpiece!

He even filmed a video of himself, digging through his own waste, to show you that it all really did happen.

Hsu told local media he washed the AirPod and it functioned properly.

""'The battery was still at 41 percent! It was incredible,' he told The Daily Mail.

If Hsu had not successfully passed the AirPod through his system, plan B would have been surgery.

Jonathan Moist was arrested on a felony charge of video voyeurism of someone at least 19 years old.

According to the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, Moists' niece and her friend who were housesitting for Moist discovered the hidden camera in November.

1228,Pit bull injured after being dragged by pick-up truck in Spring Hill,"Pit bull injured after being dragged by pick-up truck in Spring Hill

Spring Hill, FLA - A young pit bull is recovering after witnesses tell News Chanel 8, someone dragged him from a rope tied the back of a pick-up truck bumper.

It happened at the intersection of Northcliffe Boulevard and Franconia Avenue in Spring Hill.

On Friday morning, the owner of the Nature Coast Animal Wellness and Surgery Center in Weeki Wachess witnessed a horrible scene.

Jan Harwood saw a dog get hurled into the road after he was dragged by a truck doing 30 to 40 miles an hour.

Harwood and a man driving a van, stopped right away, as the pick-up driver drove off. They discovered the pit bull, she named ""Ollie"" with severe road rash all over his body, and the pads of his feet worn off.

She told the van owner, she owned a vet clinic just up the highway. He took the injured pit to the clinic where the Vet did x-rays and ultra-sounds.

He found, Ollie has no broken bones and no internal injuries.

That's quite amazing, considering the traumatic incident he'd just been through.

“He was beating the ground with such velocity and such a high rate of speed, so he was being pulled along and then when the driver of the truck decided to make a turn, luckily when he made that turn, the dog's head slipped out of the collar. It was attached to the rope” said clinic owner, Jan Harwood.

Hernando County deputies are searching for an older, beat up, blue pick-up truck.

It had some furniture in the back.

MARTIN COUNTY — A man accused of burglarizing a home fled from Martin County to the other side of the country, but was caught nonetheless, the Sheriff's Office said.

Brent Justin Jamison Faggins, 26, of Newport Beach, California, was being held Saturday in Las Vegas on warrants out of Martin County, according to the Sheriff's Office and jail records in Clark County, Nevada. The Sheriff's Office said he will be extradited.

On April 12, Faggins smashed through a glass door at a home and burglarized it, Martin County Sheriff's detectives said. Surveillance video inside the home helped detectives identify him.

Seaweed. Or what marine-life scientists call sargassum. It’s inundating Cocoa Beach.

And watch where you step, the Portuguese Man of War come ashore with it.

Every May the beaches get a coating of the stuff.

Eventually the tide will take it back out, but in the meantime, Belinda and Alanna Pino are determined to get some beach time in.

They’re visiting Cocoa Beach through Sunday.

“We come to the beach for the sun and the water, and this is just an extra, it’s just different,” Belinda Pino said.

“Lots of people are kicking it, stepping over it, and jumping, I guess because it feels gross for them,” said Alana Pino.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/cocoa-beach-being-overrun-by-massive-amounts-of-seaweed,2019-05-04T16:37:28Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
1232,Dog recovering after being dragged behind truck,"- WARNING: This story may have content that is graphic due to the nature of the crime.

A pit bull is recovering Saturday morning after being dragged behind a truck in Weeki Wachee, Florida.

Jan Johnson, owner of Nature Coast Animal Wellness & Surgical Center, saw the dog as it was being dragged by a truck down Northcliffe Blvd. on Friday.

""He came loose and flew into the median at which point he was rescued,"" the center writes in a post on Facebook.

A man named Jason who works for Spectrum brought the dog to the center for treatment. Photos posted to Facebook show the horrific injuries the pit bull endured: the dog was covered in scrapes and cuts all over its body from the dragging. Fortunately, veterinarians say the dog had no broken bones, but they are monitoring for internal bleeding.

The center says the dog appears to be about 1 to 2-years-old and had no microchip. He will stay at the center to heal and then put up for adoption.

""Please pray for him and that the person who did this gets caught!""

The truck is described as an older, full-size pickup with faded dark blue paint that appeared to be hauling furniture and junk in the cab. Anyone with information is asked to call the Hernando County Sheriff's Office at 352-754-6830.

There is a GoFundMe set up to help pay for the dog's medical care.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/dog-recovering-after-being-dragged-behind-truck,2019-05-04T13:22:10Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

Port St. Lucie police say John J. Joyce masturbated outside of his home in his backyard while completely unclothed.

According to police, neighbors reported that a naked man was walking around the neighborhood along Lake Forest Way April 28. They also reported that the man was standing outside of a home and tugging on his genitals.

Police were able to make contact with the man they believed to be the suspect, but he was fully dressed when they approached him.

However, police found neighborhood surveillance video showing the suspect, Joyce, standing in the back corner of his house and masturbating.

1235,"Public defender must represent Nikolas Cruz, judge rules","Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz stares at a television camera during a hearing, May 1, 2019, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A judge ruled that the public defender must continue representing the man charged in last year’s Florida high school massacre because he is unlikely to obtain a large inheritance left by his mother.

Judge Elizabeth Scherer ruled Friday that Broward County public defenders must represent 20-year-old Nikolas Cruz. The office recently asked to be removed from the case because the former Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student could receive $432,000 before taxes from his late mother’s annuity. Under state law, the office can only represent indigent defendants.

Scherer ruled Cruz hasn’t applied for the money and if he did, it would likely be claimed through lawsuits filed by his victims’ families.

Cruz’s attorneys say he would plead guilty to killing 17 for a life sentence. Prosecutors want the death penalty.

A Georgia man has been sentenced to time served for keeping a teenage girl in sexual captivity for more than a year.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports 33-year-old Michael Wysolovski was sentenced to 10 years, with eight months of jail time, after pleading guilty Thursday to first-degree cruelty to children and interstate interference with custody.Wysolovski will receive credit for eight months spent in detention before his trial, meaning his prison time has already been served and probation will account for the remaining nine years and four months of the sentence. He must also register as a sex offender for life.He was arrested in 2017 after law enforcement found a 17-year-old North Carolina girl who’d been missing for over a year in his home in Duluth, a suburb north of Atlanta.The two met in an online forum for anorexia when the girl, who is not being named because she is a sexual assault victim, was 15 and said she was unhappy at home. Wysolovski later convinced the girl to come live with him, picking her up when she was 16 on the side of an interstate near her Charlotte-area home.Georgia’s age of consent is 16, so Wysolovski could not be charged with child molestation.Prosecutor Michael DeTardo said the victim and Wysolovski initially agreed to enter into a sexual relationship in which they simulated non-consensual sex acts. But over time, Wysolovski violated the agreement, using “excessive force” and refusing to recognize “safe words.” DeTardo said Wysolovski also used food to punish the victim, who was anorexic, or forced her to perform sex acts.The newspaper reports that DeTardo said the relationship was a “gray area” of consent that would be risky to bring before a jury. Rape and aggravated sodomy charges were dropped in the plea deal, and the victim’s family and DeTardo prioritized a requirement for Wysolovski to register as a sex offender.Wysolovski told the court he believed he was helping the victim escape a bad home life.Police located the girl after she contacted another person on an anorexia forum who contacted the FBI.During a victim impact statement Thursday, the girl’s father said she was found malnourished, with ringworm and suffering from back problems because she had been repeatedly held in a dog cage.Holding a stuffed animal and speaking in a soft voice, the victim told the court: “The psychological damage Michael Wysolovski inflicted is beyond imagination.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/no-prison-time-for-man-who-kept-teenage-girl-in-sexual-captivity-for-a-year/27355124,2019-05-03T14:50:00Z,WPBF-TV,Florida Man,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

1243,Jacksonville man found guilty of murder in 2016 robbery,"Jacksonville Sheriff's Office booking photo of Jihad Smith (left) and photo provided by family of Bryan Davis-Jones (right)

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A 20-year-old Jacksonville man was convicted of the 2016 killing of a 25-year-old man, the State Attorney's Office announced Thursday.

A jury found Jihad Abdul Smith guilty of first-degree murder and tampering with evidence, the State Attorney's Office said.

He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. A sentencing hearing is set for June.

Smith was 17 years old when he shot and killed Bryan Ramon Davis-Jones during an robbery, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Prosecutors said Smith killed Davis-Jones with a firearm that Davis-Jones had previously loaned him.

Davis-Jones was found shot to death Oct. 18, 2016, inside a crashed vehicle on West 19th Street, and police said at the time that evidence showed the shooter had been inside the car.

Police said Davis-Jones' cellphone was later found in a sewer drain and recent texts between Davis-Jones and Smith had been deleted. Prosecutors said the call log history, which contained multiple calls between Davis-Jones and Smith minutes before the murder, had also been deleted.

Smith later made arrangements to trade the firearm used in the killing, according to the State Attorney's Office.

1244,Those on Florida's front lines in the abortion battle know change is coming,"Crusaders on both sides are gearing up for the fight, as conservatives look to court advantage.

TALLAHASSEE — Turn out of the 11th floor elevator bank in the Florida State Capitol and the magenta carpet leads to the offices of two lawmakers who are running out of time.

By this April morning, the year’s legislative session has already ticked halfway past. Stalled bills teeter toward failure.

In suite 1102, by the door with the framed “feminism” poster, freshman Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani knows her pro-choice proposal never had a chance.

Across the hall, in 1101, Republican Rep. Mike Hill tries not to get frustrated that his bill isn’t gaining traction, either. He’s been following the same ban he proposed as it sweeps through Georgia, Ohio, Mississippi, outlawing abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks. Hill reminds himself to trust in God’s timing.

In hallways and on the House floor, Hill and Eskamani don’t often speak. Abortion has long been an uneasy standoff in Florida, where a privacy clause in the state’s Constitution has fended off many of the restrictions that have shuttered clinics in other states.

But politicians on both sides sense the turning tide, that the newly conservative U.S. Supreme Court may chip away at the right to terminate pregnancies or send the issue back to the states to decide, one by one.

Abortion foes across the country, after years of pushing incremental constraints, have launched a barrage of severe restrictions, some designed deliberately to dismantle precedent.

In Florida, a single abortion bill — on parental consent — creeps forward this year, but it has the potential to open the floodgates for many more. Hill and Eskamani are watching, and they can feel the ground moving.

***

Faded billboards dot the scrubby edges of Interstate 10 west toward the capital. Blue-eyed babies plead, “At 18 Days Our Hearts Are Beating!” Fetuses curl in wombs that look like the insides of eyelids.

New billboards flash orange against the Florida pine: “ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE.”

All roads lead to Tallahassee, to windowless committee halls and the white dome of the Florida Supreme Court across from the Capitol, where three new justices give conservatives an overwhelming dominance. If abortion rights contract in Florida, the decision will likely happen here.

For years, Florida has been an outlier, a haven for abortion seekers in a more hostile South. That’s because the state Constitution protects “from governmental intrusion into the person’s private life.”

In 1989, for instance, the state Supreme Court struck down an attempt to make minors get parental consent for abortions: “We can conceive of few more personal or private decisions concerning one's body that one can make in the course of a lifetime.”

Florida lawmakers knew abortion limits would tee up costly court battles most likely doomed to fail.

But the single abortion bill advancing this year, an overhaul of the bill that fell three decades ago, tackles the privacy clause head-on. The House has been receptive, the Senate lukewarm, but advocates on both sides say this is a preview of what’s to come.

***

Eskamani and Hill lie toward the edges of their parties, one a proud progressive and the other the founder of the Northwest Florida Tea Party. Both have had marginal success getting bills to move. Both made waves in their campaigns — Hill for his viral pitch to move Trump’s oft-vandalized Hollywood star to Pensacola; Eskamani for asking her rally crowds, “You see the s--t we put up with?”

They both grew up working class; both are people of color. Eskamani is the daughter of Iranian immigrants, Hill one of just two black Republican lawmakers in Florida — but he hates to be grouped into anything with a hyphen. Call him an American, he says.

They’re on two committees together, and though Hill can’t remember agreeing with Eskamani on a single thing, he respects the genuine beliefs that fuel her. She finds him kind and collegial.

Both tweet often, especially about abortion. Eskamani mixes threads on reproductive health and progressive immigration policy with snappy clap-backs to the GOP, like a Florida version of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

Hill sticks to the MAGA-style formula, decrying the “demonic Muslim horde” and retweeting all-caps posts about liberal lunacy and abortion as murder.

Take @AnnaForFlorida, in early April, in a back-and-forth with a Republican: “Access to a safe & legal abortion can’t be compared to cable TV. 1 in 4 women have had an abortion in this country— the # is on the decline & that’s due to access to birth control & sex-ed.”

Or @Mikehillfl in early April, retweeting a popular pro-Trump account that posted: “This powerful video is a MUST WATCH! The only person who doesn't get a choice in an abortion is the poor baby who's butchered alive!”

***

Outside Hill’s office, a printout sits on his aide’s desk. It’s an invitation to a showing of Unplanned, about a former Planned Parenthood clinic director-turned pro-lifer. Tagline: “What she saw changed everything.”

Inside, there’s a blue couch, beige walls, white lilies. His wide desk is bare but for some papers and a small stack of books, including one that promises The Biblical Path to Pro-Life Victory in the 21st Century and a biography of the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Hill has only read the foreword, but as a fellow devotee of the Constitution, he admired it.

Hill, 60, represents Pensacola, as far west as the Panhandle goes. This session, his second full term, he pushed to protect Confederate and veteran memorials but found little support.

His heartbeat ban, despite its long roster of co-sponsors and likely support from the governor, might have been too extreme for Florida, or not strategic enough. But he wonders: What else is he supposed to do as an Evangelical?

“I have no choice but to run this,” he says, holding his broad hands open, almost helpless.

He remembers being 13 and bored with only the Armed Forces Network to watch on the Italian base where his dad was stationed. Out of options, he picked up the Good News Bible, a leftover from Sunday school in the States. Those classes had never made sense. You’re telling me Jesus is the lamb, but also the shepherd?

He dove into Matthew.

He thought, “I’ve never read anything like that.”

It was ninth grade, 1972, and Hill started carrying the Good News everywhere, even as classmates yelled, “Mike Hill is a Jesus freak!” Later, as he took the ACT that could get him into his dream school, he prayed with each bubble, “Lord, please.”

His first night off the bus at the U.S. Air Force Academy, he got his head shaved. Officers screamed at him. He’d come craving the order his house of nine siblings lacked, but now he wondered what he had done.

Those were the years that his conviction in God wavered. The Bible became just another book.

As for abortion, he thought, let a woman choose.

It was the woman he’d marry who brought him back to church. And it was the era of Reaganomics, and his night MBA classes, that led him to register as a Republican.

In the mid-1980s, early in his wife’s first pregnancy, she miscarried.

“That quickly, she had a bond with that baby,” Hill says. Her grief felt like an epiphany to him. So did the sight of a school bus of kids and the want that filled him. He and his wife grieved together as she miscarried again.

Around that time, a Christian radio station debuted in Fort Walton Beach, where Hill was directing tests on missiles for the Air Force. He remembers hearing — for the first time — that abortion was a sin. That what he thought of as a clump of cells was a life, created by God.

He remembers when a protester at a Pensacola clinic shot Dr. David Gunn three times in 1993, the first known killing of an abortion provider in America, and the next year, when a second Pensacola doctor and his escort also were shot dead. Hill felt that any kind of extremist violence was wrong. Yet he realized just how deeply some people believed abortion needed to end and by any means.

He remembers the young woman who came to his State Farm office, pregnant. He asked her if she wanted life insurance for the baby, too, but she said she didn’t plan on keeping it. They talked. Two days later, she returned and said she’d changed her mind.

His wide-set eyes grow big as he marvels at the creation of new DNA, a new personality, in the womb. His bill replaces the word “fetus” with “unborn human being.” Hill brushes off concerns, though his bill would effectively ban abortion before some women even know they’re pregnant. A woman wouldn’t hurt herself with a coat hanger to end a pregnancy, he scoffs. He wishes he didn’t have to include exceptions for rape and incest.

“To me, it’s utterly amazing that God would give a woman the privilege of carrying a life in her body,” he says, his voice boyish in its awe.

***

In the middle of March, Hill had stood in the Capitol’s marbled rotunda, hoping to give his heartbeat bill momentum at a press conference. Other states were moving forward, faster.

“You can go to prison for destroying an eagle’s egg,” lamented Sen. Dennis Baxley of Ocala, the bill’s Senate sponsor. “Yet, somehow we reconcile that it’s okay to put women in this position and open a doorway that says it’s okay to destroy your offspring.”

Eskamani stood before the men, impassive. She had helped scramble protesters, who flooded in 60-something strong, holding hot pink signs like “WE DECIDE” and “ABORTION BANS ARE DANGEROUS.”

Hill, in a firm voice, said Florida was no New York or Virginia, where pro-choice politicians were trying to ease restrictions on late-term abortions. “We celebrate life,” he said, as cameras rolled.

A fellow activist nudged Eskamani to “do a mic check,” to make a megaphone out of supporters’ voices.

She had nothing scripted, and she worried that she’d offend her legislative colleagues.

But she shut down that thought. They were offending her with their policies.

“Mic check,” she finally said loudly, the muscle memory and adrenaline kicking in.

The crowd around her echoed every line.

“WE SUPPORT ACCESS,” she shouted,

“TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH!”

“INCLUDING” — she paused,

“ACCESS” —

“TO A SAFE AND LEGAL” —

“ABORTION!”

Hill could barely hear reporters’ questions, as others swarmed Eskamani.

“If this ever does reach the governor’s desk,” she told them, breathless, “he should know that the women around me are going to be there.”

***

In her office, Eskamani tracks bills on a beat-up Macbook covered in faded stickers, her walls a gallery. There she is, jubilant at Orlando Pride. A poster shouts, “My favorite season is the fall of the patriarchy.” There’s her face on Time magazine’s 2018 “Avengers” cover: First they marched. Now they’re running.

Recently, she hung a photo from Persian New Year. Dark hair streaming behind her, she leaps with glee over a fire, while her twin sister, Ida, pours on more gasoline just ahead.

She’s got a flurry of bills at play this session, trying to increase training on sexual harassment, make it harder for domestic abusers to keep guns and get money for her local library.

When Eskamani is stressed, which is often recently, she fingers the gold necklace she hasn’t taken off since her mom got sick with cancer.

After she died, Eskamani and her sister didn’t know where to turn when their bodies began to change. They were 13 and couldn’t drive to buy pads or tampons. They didn’t know how to talk with their dad.

Every month, Eskamani bled through the paper towels stuffed into her shorts.

She remembers the shame, too, of her high school sex education in Orlando, the chewed stick of gum held up to illustrate a used woman, and the candy she was offered to mark her “commit-mint” to abstinence. She was a people pleaser but stormed out of the classroom without taking it.

She remembers searching for information online and finding Planned Parenthood. At 18, she made an appointment. At the modest health center near the University of Central Florida, she saw moms bouncing babies and boyfriends picking up girlfriends’ pills. She left with a birth control prescription of her own.

Those were the years she read books by Iranian women to better understand her mom. There was a word for what she felt, and it was feminism.

At UCF, she wrote op-eds about women’s rights and began escorting patients through picket lines at Planned Parenthood, which later hired her to host events and then do public affairs.

Every year she worked there, at least one attempt to restrict abortion moved through the Legislature, despite the likelihood of a court challenge. She’d wear her Planned Parenthood pink dress to Tallahassee and watch from the gallery as legislators greenlit new restrictions. Back at the clinics, she’d wipe tears from patients’ faces.

In recovery rooms, she handed out ginger ale, heat packs, crackers. Patients flew in from Central America, drove hours from other states, called the front desk scared to get out of the car. She became a notary, so she could sign off on parental notifications for minors. In here, she wanted patients to understand, you’re safe.

Her Planned Parenthood boss wrote one of the first checks to her 2018 campaign.

Eskamani, 28, has always felt abortion is nuanced, a decision for a woman, her doctor, her faith and her family. She believes in the power of telling women’s stories, especially since some of her fellow Democrats still balk at defending abortion in the spotlight.

She discovered, by accident, that her own mother had an abortion.

She found the clinic papers while sifting through a briefcase of family documents. Her mom had been 40; the pregnancy had been high-risk. Eskamani imagines her mom walking that picket line, with three children at home, making that choice.

Hill takes the elevator down one Monday in April, phone in hand, committee-bound. Over his heart, he wears a tiny gold pin, baby feet at 10 weeks.

The House Judiciary Committee room is nearly full, and he takes a seat near the end of a long table up front. As the agenda unspools, members debate esoteric proposals for an hour before Republican Rep. Erin Grall approaches the lectern to discuss her parental consent bill.

Florida Channel cameras roll, sending a stream to TVs across the Capitol, and into Eskamani’s office, where she flips through binder tabs and listens, pained.

It’s not enough, Grall explains, that minors must notify parents or guardians before an abortion. She wants doctors to get a parent’s formal consent.

She explains that minors can seek a judicial waiver to bypass the requirement. Her bill would provide for them to have a pro bono lawyer.

Eskamani knows abortion opponents have a powerful weapon in this bill, because it appears palatable and yet packs a punch.

One by one, people from the audience walk up to the microphone. A woman from a Catholic group says to support parents’ involvement, because the adolescent brain is underdeveloped. A belligerent man with a bald spot plugging “infowars dot com” shouts, “Abortion is bringing this country under judgment,” while a woman in the crowd nods, eyes squeezed shut. A man with spiky, gelled hair and a paisley pocket square says: “One life is worth everything.”

Hill’s stoic face gives up a small smile.

Social workers, Latina activists, law students and Planned Parenthood defenders approach in hot pink T-shirts. They speak of abuse, incest, domestic violence. They talk about minors who attempt unsafe abortions.

A woman holds the hand of her curly-haired daughter, who wears a fuzzy vest in Cookie Monster blue.

“As a person that was sexually abused by one of my brothers,” the woman says, “I completely understand that I would not have been able to bring this up with my parents.”

On TV, Eskamani sees the whole panel: 16 male legislators, two female, and the stream of women begging to be heard.

Shortly before the vote, Rep. Mike Beltran, a Republican from Lithia, leans on an elbow.

He references the woman who came with her daughter.

“Beautiful little daughter with curly hair,” he says. “And that was perhaps the most compelling argument of all for this bill.”

Hill votes “Yes.”

***

Two weeks later, lawmakers swivel in cushioned chairs on the House floor, awaiting debate on the parental consent bill, buried deep in the afternoon agenda. At her desk in the back corner, Eskamani readies for her last stand.

House Bill 1335 is finally called at 6 p.m.

She doesn’t have the votes to stop the bill, but she’s drafted questions and prepped Democrats for battle.

Why not work to stop unintended pregnancies instead? Medical professionals have grave concerns, are you aware?

Grall stands with a microphone, fending off the barrage.

“I believe that parents have the best interests for their children in mind for their medical outcomes,” she says.

How are minors without internet access supposed to know their options? Is the current parental notice system not effective? What has changed that would make this legislation constitutional?

Eskamani stands to introduce an amendment, which would make information about judicial waivers easier to find. But the room is growing louder. Some leaders just walk out.

“Madam Speaker, there’s a lot of noise back here if you could help,” Eskamani says, exasperated. “We want young people to make an informed decision.”

Her amendment fails.

In debate, thanks largely to Eskamani’s spreadsheets and prep work, Democrats paint pictures of at-risk girls forced to carry babies to term and teenagers who live 45 minutes from the closest courthouse.

Republicans speak less but urge colleagues not to deprive all parents of rights because of a few bad apples. Don’t teens need permission for an aspirin in the nurse’s office or a trip to the zoo? They point out that the privacy clause says nothing explicitly about abortion. A few quote Psalms and Jeremiah.

Hill doesn’t speak. Instead, he retweets a stock image of babies with the caption, “Jesus loves the children born, preborn, unplanned, planned, unwanted, wanted, perfect, not perfect!” He tweets about his heartbeat bill with his usual commentary: “Come on, Florida!”

In the middle of all this, Eskamani stands again, hand on hip. She paces, looking down at the carpet.

“Imagine that you’re 16 years old, you realize you’re pregnant, and you literally have no one to talk to,” Eskamani says. She looks up. “Or in fact, members, imagine that you’re me.”

She tells them her mom died when she was a teenager. That her dad left to work abroad. She said she was scared to become pregnant. What would she do?

She looks down at her notes.

“I humbly ask for you to have some empathy on this issue,” she says. “It’s not black and white.”

Soon, the vote board will light up in green, and the bill will sail over to the Senate, where a slightly different version is stuck in the committee phase, with about one week to rush it to the floor.

Eskamani knows the battles are just beginning, that abortion opponents won’t let this moment pass, not while they have power in every branch.

So she plans to introduce her pro-choice bill again. Hill, quietly, plans the same for his heartbeat bill. The lines have been drawn.

1248,Florida man pretending to be cop pulls over undercover officer,"HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. - One Florida man learned the hard way that just because you want to be a cop doesn't mean you are a cop.

Matthew Joseph Erris of Dade City (not Miami-Dade County... whew!) was arrested Tuesday for impersonating a police officer, WFLA reports.

How he was caught is what makes this truly a #FloridaMan story.

On Tuesday evening, Erris turned on red and blue flashing lights on his SUV and pulled over a car. The car was being driven by an undercover detective.

Oops.

Knowing the traffic stop was odd, the detective called 911 and actual deputies showed up to take Erris into custody.

Police found a ""realistic looking"" airsoft pistol in Erris' SUV and had a law enforcement light bar installed in the vehicle.

Erris was arrested and released on bond while officials attempt to determine if he had committed similar moves with non-cops before.

1252,Help 'Stamp Out Hunger' on Saturday,"Donations made locally through the nation's largest single-day food drive will remain in Marion County.

Got an extra can of beans, or some peanut butter and jelly? Someone else could use it. Actually, lots of others could use a bag of groceries.

Single moms trying to feed their children. Someone who lost a job and is now homeless. A man or woman who is simply down on their luck. These are all examples of people who visit area help agencies, food banks and soup kitchens on a daily basis.

On Saturday, area residents can help the needy in Marion County by placing bags of non-perishable food items on mailboxes for collection by local letter carriers.

The second Saturday of May is collection day for the annual National Association of Letter Carriers Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive. This is the 27th year for what has become the nation's largest single-day food drive. The food collected in Marion County will remain here to help local people.

To learn more, we did this question and answer session with Timothy Legge, a letter carrier and the local drive organizer; Karla Grimsley, executive director of Interfaith Emergency Services; and Jessica Nisbett, donor relations director for United Way of Marion County.

TIMOTHY LEGGE

Question: Marion County has long been a national leader in collections for the drive. How do you think this year will compare to past drives?

Answer: Donations locally have been in a downtrend the last few years. The biggest change this year is that Farm Share (Farmshare.org) has stepped up and provided plastic food drive bags for the entire state of Florida. Every resident should be receiving one of these bags in their mailbox before Friday. We are hoping that this serves as another reminder to donate and helps to reverse the trend.

Our carriers and volunteers are ready, and we would like to see a donation in every mailbox this year. Donations can also be dropped off at your local post office.

Q: How many letter carriers will be collecting items Saturday in Marion County?

A: There will be hundreds of Marion County rural and city carriers in 19 offices participating in this year's food drive.

Q: What kinds of food are needed?

A: Lists what type of items can be donated can be found at this website: www.nalc.org/community-service/food-drive/frequently-asked-questions.

Q: Some of the annual postcards announcing the date were distributed last week and some people placed donations on their mailboxes last Saturday. Is the food being stored for addition to the drive on Saturday?

A: Some routes began delivering the cards as early as last Thursday but most residents in Marion County will be receiving them this week. Many residents have already given their donations to their carriers, and we appreciate that. We are getting these donations to Interfaith as we receive them.

KARLA GRIMSLEY

Question: How many agencies will this food go to?

Answer: It goes to all of Interfaith’ s pantries (Ocala, Fellowship, Fort McCoy, Marion Oaks, Dunnellon and Reddick) as well as nine other local agencies and churches countywide, including Brothers Keeper, Salvation Army, His Compassion, St. Theresa’s, Gateway to Hope and the Help Agency of the Forest. Basically, those agencies who come and help that day get to take a portion of the food.

Q: What is the impact of this drive on area families?

A: This drive is the saving grace for the summer months. You have families with children who were getting food at school during the week that now have to come up with more meals and utility bills running high due to the summer heat, so families are stretched. These families will need assistance to make ends meet and without this food drive Interfaith definitely wouldn’t be able to meet the needs of everyone coming to us in the summer months.

Q: What else can people do to help at other times of the year?

A: Volunteer in the pantry; donate money to help us keep lights on and trucks running that pick-up food throughout the year; and ask your church, civic group or neighborhood to hold a food drive. If you collect the food, Interfaith will come and pick it up. Call 629-8868, ext. 212, for a food pick-up and ext. 207 to learn about becoming a volunteer.

Note that this one day of the year our letter carriers go above and beyond the call of duty to help needy families in this county. They are the real heroes of the day. It is a long, back-breaking day for them. Leave a note of encouragement or thanks on your mailbox.

JESSICA NISBETT

Question: How is this drive important to United Way of Marion County programs?

Answer: Many of United Way of Marion County’s internal and funded programs help support families and individuals who take advantage of the generous donations provided through this annual food drive.

Hunger is a major barrier to success for children, adults and seniors in Marion County. Imagine how difficult it must be for a student to focus when their belly is empty, or an adult attempting to be productive when their mind may be focused on where their next meal will come from.

Without this drive, many could go hungry as our local food pantries run low, so it is critical to the overall success of our community to give back and ensure that our neighbors have one of their most basic needs met. Each year, our community does an outstanding job to rally around our most vulnerable and exemplify what it means to Live United.

Q: Will you have volunteers working on the drive?

A: United Way of Marion County supports the drive through public awareness efforts, ensuring that our community is aware of the opportunity to give back through this annual effort and helping to recruit volunteers to pick-up or sort food the day-of.

Q: What are other ways people can help your mission?

A: United Way of Marion County allows you to find your voice and fight to make a difference for what is most meaningful to you. We are a partner of choice for individuals and businesses in our community as they give, advocate and volunteer for causes that they are passionate about.

1253,Project SEARCH graduates celebrated,"The Project SEARCH program at Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center works with students with disabilities, ages 18 to 22, to help prepare them for skilled jobs in a variety of industries.

LAKELAND — Sitting in the front row of Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center's Mulaney Family Auditorium on Friday were Project SEARCH's six graduates, decked out in caps and gowns and smiling after completing the training program for students with disabilities. Behind them — literally and figuratively — were teary-eyed family members, who had hoped for this day for years, and dozens of LRHMC employees, who helped to train the graduates.

""You're ready to begin your adult lives in our community,” Sandy Perlewitz, the Project SEARCH facilitator for Polk County Public Schools, told the graduates. “We love you so much.”

The Project SEARCH program at LRHMC works with students with disabilities, ages 18 to 22, to help prepare them for skilled jobs in a variety of industries. This is the third class of graduates from the program, which began 18 months ago as a partnership between Lakeland Regional Health, Polk County Public Schools, the Center for Independent Living in Central Florida Inc., Vocational Rehabilitation, and the Florida Developmental Disabilities Council. Project SEARCH, which began at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, is a business-led, one-year work-preparation program for young people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Even after employment, students continue to receive job coaching and support from Center for Independent Living and Vocational Rehabilitation trainers while working and earning incomes.

According to Cornell University's 2017 Disability Statistics, people with disabilities are employed less than half as often as their counterparts without disabilities. Project SEARCH offers students with disabilities a way to overcome that with on-the-job skills training.

All six graduates landed jobs — LRHMC hired four of the graduates, while another has a job at Hawthorne Inn Assisted Living Facility and the sixth was hired by Cardinal Health. A video produced by the hospital showed each of their reactions as they were offered full-time positions.

Darius Gibbs-Ellis received a job offer to work on “The Trash Team” in the hospital.

“I got the job!” he said after receiving his offer, a smile spreading across his face. Friday morning, he said he loves his job and the program. ”It's an opportunity for people. I want to help people out with their opportunity.”

""He does a good job,” Wilson said Friday morning.

Gibbs-Ellis was raised by his grandmother, Alma Franklyn, who is also raising his three siblings. She works as an accountant in Lakeland.

“Watching him mature into the man he has become was moving,” Franklyn said. “I'm still crying.”

As a boy, he attended Cleveland Court Elementary School. The school's then-secretary Diane Kossman saw the goodness in Franklyn and her grandchildren and informally adopted them as a second grandmother, often walking the children home from school.

“She was a special lady, just watching her provide for those four children,” said Kossman, hugging Gibbs-Ellis.

He graduated from Lakeland High School, for which he played defensive end on the state championship football team. His coach, Michael Farley, was also on hand to see his success Friday.

“You're going to buy me lunch now, right?” Farley joked.

As interns at the hospital, the group did everything from preparing food, sterilizing instruments, working in and around the operating room and patient transportation. They also learned how to shake hands, write a resume, practice interviewing and several other “soft skills” needed for success.

Scott Dimmick, senior vice president and chief human resources officer for LRH, told the students that he, too, struggled to achieve success after a childhood rooted in poverty.

“I had a few mentors and advisers who said never give up,” Dimmick said, adding that the hospital's three core values of “treasure, nurture and inspire” pertained to them, too. “We will fully fund your career growth in our organization — we will pay for all of that tuition.”

Graduate Kevontae Jones was described as someone who smiled constantly and was always willing to try something new.

“I am so blessed in being here,” he said in a brief speech. “Thanks to my mama right there, who inspired me.”

Polk County Public Schools Superintendent Jacqueline Byrd, Deputy Superintendent John Hill, Chief Academic Officer Michael Akes and Director of Exceptional Student Education Diane Taylor were all in attendance Friday morning. Assistant Superintendent of Learning Support Kimberly Steinke explained that they go to every graduation ceremony in the district and shake thousands of hands.

“But this is definitely by far one of the best and most special graduations we go to each year,” Steinke said. “It's important you understand how precious and how valuable you are to Polk County Schools … You are the epitome of what we want going through this program.”

PLANO, Texas (WFLA) - A Texas bartender who allegedly served alcohol to a man who later went on a shooting rampage in Plano, killing his estranged wife and 7 others, has been charged with a misdemeanor, KXAS-TV reported.

Lindsey Glass, 27, was arrested April 30 and charged with allegedly violating a Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code titled ""Sale to Certain Persons.""

The code states that “a person commits an offense if the person with criminal negligence sells an alcoholic beverage to an habitual drunkard or an intoxicated or insane person.”

According to an affidavit, Glass was working at Local Public House in Plano on Sept. 10, 2017, the night Spencer Hight gunned down 8 people at his estranged wife's home. Hight was shot and killed by police responding to the shooting call.

Police said Hight had been drinking at Local Public House prior to the attack and that Glass had served him two gin-and-tonics, two beers and a shot of vodka

""Hight was unsteady on his feet and staggered around the bar, running into tables and walking sideways,"" according to the TABC report.

At one point, he allegedly pulled out a large knife, spun it around the bar and made remarks about ""putting someone in their place"" and ""taking care of some dirty work,"" according to the report.

According to police, Glass continued to serve him drinks as he spun the knife on the counter, but was alarmed enough to text another bartender about it.

“Spencer has a big knife on the bar and is spinning it and just asked for his tab and said I have to go do some dirty work,"" she said in the text.

Investigators with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission say Glass was trained and certified to identify and avoid the sale of alcohol to intoxicated customers.

The agency canceled the bar's permit in October and a lawsuit was filed against the bar in 2018, accusing them of negligence.

Paul Sienko lives near where it happened.

“I was beside myself because I ran out there right after it happened. It was really tragic,” he said.

Sienko said it was the worst accident he's seen at that intersection.

“You see such close calls,"" he said. ""We've had about six bad accidents out there that I remember.”

“He had alcohol in his system. That's when we were able to partner with the state attorney's office to determine that we could charge him,” said Evelyn Estevez, with the Altamonte Springs Police Department.

Police charged Mora with DUI manslaughter and booked him into the Seminole County jail. They said the victims' family is relieved.

“This is a devastating thing for the family. We met them last night and gave them the news he'd been arrested and they were grateful.

1265,"CCSO: Man arrested, charged with felonies in North Naples after foot chase","CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

After a foot chase, the use of a Taser and the efforts of five deputies, a man was arrested and charged with multiple felonies in North Naples on Wednesday.

The incident began just after 1 a.m. when a deputy from the Collier County Sheriff’s Office noticed a speeding vehicle traveling southbound on Airport-Pulling Road near Vanderbilt Beach Road.

Bryan Christopher Delashmet, 25, was driving the vehicle owned by a passenger, according to his arrest report from the sheriff’s office.

After observing the vehicle speeding and making a traffic stop, a deputy smelled marijuana coming from inside the vehicle Delashmet was driving, according to the report.

The deputy searched Delashmet and a small bag he had hanging around his neck. Inside the bag, the deputy found an electric scale and a sandwich bag containing what appeared to be marijuana, according to the report.

The deputy attempted to place Delashmet under arrest when he pulled away while being handcuffed.

Delashmet began to run down a ditch next to the road while deputies tried to handcuff him, according to the report.

Delashmet swung at the deputies, knocked their radios off their shirts and forcefully pushed them away, according to the report from the sheriff's office.

During the incident, Delashmet got one of his hands onto one of the deputy’s handguns and repeatedly attempted to pull it out of the deputy’s holster, according to the report.

A different deputy shocked Delashmet with a Taser, but he broke free from the deputies and ran southbound along Airport-Pulling Road toward Orange Blossom Drive.

Delashmet continued running and hid in some bushes, where a deputy shocked him with a Taser for the second time, according to the report.

As the deputy put handcuffs on Delashmet’s wrists, Delashmet tugged and cut the deputy, who started bleeding, according to the report.

It took five deputies to successfully force both of Delashmet's hands behind his back and get the handcuffs on both of his wrists, according to the arrest report.

Delashmet was transported to the Naples Jail Center and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting an officer with violence, possession of a controlled substance, possession of marijuana and no valid driver’s license.

1267,CCSO: Man arrested and charged with felonies in North Naples after foot chase,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

After a foot chase, the use of a Taser and the efforts of five deputies, a man was arrested and charged with multiple felonies in North Naples on Wednesday.

The incident began just after 1 a.m. when a deputy from the Collier County Sheriff’s Office noticed a speeding vehicle traveling southbound on Airport-Pulling Road near Vanderbilt.

Bryan Christopher Delashmet, 25, was driving the vehicle owned by a passenger, according to his arrest report from the sheriff’s office.

After observing the vehicle speeding and making a traffic stop, a deputy smelled marijuana coming from inside the vehicle Delashmet was driving, according to the report.

The deputy searched Delashmet and a small bag he had hanging around his neck. Inside the bag, the deputy found an electric scale and a sandwich bag containing what appeared to be marijuana, according to the report.

The deputy attempted to place Delashmet under arrest when he pulled away while being handcuffed.

Delashmet began to run down a ditch next to the road while deputies tried to handcuff him, according to the report.

Delashmet swung at the deputies and knocked their radios off their shirts then forcefully pushed them away, according to the report from the sheriff's office.

During the incident, Delashmet got one of his hands onto one of the deputy’s hand guns and repeatedly attempted to pull it out of the deputy’s holster, according to the report.

A different deputy shocked Delashmet with a Taser, but he broke free from the deputies and ran southbound along Airport-Pulling Road towards Orange Blossom Drive.

Delashmet continued running and hid in some bushes, then a deputy shocked him with a Taser for the second time, according to the report.

The deputy began to take control of Delashmet. While the deputy put handcuffs on Delashmet’s wrists, Delashmet tugged and cut the deputy, who started bleeding, according to the report.

It took five deputies to successfully force both of Delashmet's hands behind his back and get the handcuffs on both of his wrists, according to the arrest report.

Delashmet was transported to the Naples Jail Center and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting an officer with violence, possession of a controlled substance, possession of marijuana and no valid driver’s license.

CLEARWATER, Fla. (WFLA) – Clearwater police and Clearwater Fire & Rescue were called to a pedestrian-involved crash Thursday night.

The crash occurred at 9:48 p.m. in the 2800 block of Gulf-to-Bay Boulevard.

The man who was hit was taken by ambulance to Bayfront Health St. Petersburg as a trauma alert, but his injuries are not thought to be life threatening.

The victim was trying to push a disabled vehicle into the Racetrac parking lot when a vehicle traveling west struck the car.

The impact sent the disabled car into the victim.

The driver of the vehicle who struck the other car remained on scene.

After being alerted by a passerby Tuesday that a couple appeared to be ready to fornicate in front of the Key West Police Station, an officer caught the man and woman in action, so to speak.

The man, Gary Hill, was found with his shorts down around his ankles; while the woman, Crystal Frances, was wearing neither pants or underwear.

When the officer asked the couple what they were doing, Hill replied, ""It was a Key West moment.""

While Hill followed the officer's orders and put his clothes back on, Frances refused, leading to the officer to believe she was intoxicated.

Without being prompted, Hill blurted out to the officer, ""I'm horny"" and admitted the couple had drank a pint of vodka earlier in the evening. A bottle of vodka was found next to the spot where Hill and Frances were having sex.

Hill was arrested and charged with Lewd & Lascivious Indecent Exposure | Having sex in public, while Frances was taken to the hospital. Once she is released from the hospital, a warrant is expected to be issued for her arrest.

1274,Florida man arrested for impersonating officer after pulling over undercover detective,"- A man was arrested for impersonating a law enforcement officer after he unknowingly pulled over an undercover detective.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office posted about the incident on Facebook.

They said that 26-year-old Matthew Joseph Erris decided to play cop, turning on his red and blue lights and pulling somebody over. However, he had no idea that the other driver was a real undercover Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office detective.

They went on to state that deputies then did a real traffic stop on Erris. They found an airsoft pistol under his passenger seat.

Erris is reportedly facing a charge for impersonating a law enforcement officer.

Deputies said that they are not sure how many times Erris has done this in the past. Anyone who recognizes his vehicle and believes they may have been a victim should contact the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office at 813-247-8200.

1280,'Moonshot' explores memories of the Great Space Race,"Robert Holladay (Photo: Special to the Democrat)

It has been 50 years this July since man first landed on the moon, and a wave of nostalgia about those days is sweeping the publishing world.

Just three of the books that have appeared recently include James Hanson’s biography of Neil Armstrong, ""First Man"" ( and the resulting movie), Robert Kurson’s ""Rocket Men"" about Apollo 8, and now Douglas Brinkley’s ""American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space.""

Douglas Brinkley is one of our most prominent public historians, and I don’t particularly mean that in a positive way. He has jumped around some in his career, from Tulane and now to Rice University, and as his dust jacket blurb says “serves on boards, at museums, at colleges, and for historical societies.”

I don’t like to criticize books in this column but there are aspects of ""American Moonshot"" that are problematic. The book covers roughly 20 years, from the development of the V-2 rocket in Nazi Germany by Werner von Braun and his Pennemunde scientists, to the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963, with a couple of short chapters at the end about what happened after Kennedy went to Dallas.

It is a hagiography really, about Kennedy and his obsession to beat the Russians to the moon, and with the exception of a couple of very slight references to his “attraction to women,” it may as well have been titled “St. John.”

American Moonshot (Photo: Special to the Democrat)

One of the positive things about ""American Moonshot"" — despite his own repeated assertions that von Braun was complicit in war crimes at the Mittelwerk factory where Germany built the V-2’s because of his awareness that slave labor was being used — is that it re-establishes him as the most important rocket scientist involved in the space program, although Brinkley is clearly grudging about it.

Beginning roughly in 1970, after Apollo 11, NASA began to realize the moral complications of having ex members of the Nazi party working on such a highly publicized project and began to shed them.

My father, who worked with von Braun for six years at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, always considered this a colossal mistake. Von Braun was moved first to NASA headquarters in Washington, and when he realized that his efforts to promote a voyage to Mars and other projects were not going anywhere as the Vietnam War and the Great Society ate up all the money, left NASA and joined the Fairchild Corporation where he died in 1977.

In the years since, there has been a concerted effort on the part of historians and popular culture to argue that the German scientists were really not that important to the space program (if you see 1983 movie adaptation of Tom Wolfe’s ""The Right Stuff,"" von Braun is never identified, just an unnamed German administrator who is a buffoon).

Brinkley absolutely explodes that by, among other things, pointing out that at the end of the World War II, the German rocket program was eight years ahead of the United States, and getting von Braun and his scientists erased the gap overnight.

You can almost hear Brinkley’s teeth grind as he describes the relationship between two morally compromised men — both absolutely indispensable to the success of the moon program — who happened to like each other a lot.

Indeed, to Kennedy, von Braun’s Nazi past was not a factor; von Braun was simply fighting for his country. Von Braun, for his part, was effusive about finding someone who shared his obsession with space flight and was willing to spend the money to do it, and they forged a genuine friendship.

Between the two of them, they sold the Great Space Race to the public.

Brinkley’s book is entertaining, even if it has the air of having been written in a hurry to get it out in time for the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 this summer.

As such, there are some errors in it that might slide past the general reader, but not past someone raised close to the space program as was I. For example, on Page 107 he states that the test pad for the Marshall Center’s rocket boosters “was on the Tennessee River, which flowed into the Atlantic Ocean.” Well, if you were raised in the southeast, you know that the Tennessee River flows into the Ohio River which flows into the Mississippi River, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico.

Then on Page 375 there is this: “Bob Gilruth, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center told the astronauts that there would be eleven or twelve manned Gemini flights…” Well, sorry again, but Bob Gilruth was director of the Houston Manned Space Flight Center created in 1961. Gilruth, for his part, thought von Braun was a prima donna. These are the kind of errors that a good fact checker or copy editor could have caught.

One way that the Great Space Race was sold to the American people was as an extension of the nation’s founding myth, the Frontier Myth, with its rugged individuals, vast expanses of space waiting to be conquered, etc. It was an analogy that lasted as late as 2000 when Clint Eastwood released a movie about the space program called, appropriately enough, ""Space Cowboys.""

Werner von Braun played an archetypal role in the space western, too, one that Brinkley reinforces: that of the flawed individual like Shane, Ethan Edwards or Tom Doniphon who, through his know-how or ruthlessness (or a combination of both) manages to make it possible to defeat the bad guys, but whose methods and past then render him an outcast from polite civilization. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.

1283,Caught on video: Tallahassee Police investigating two week-old armed robberies,"CLOSE TPD's Violent Crimes Unit is investigating an Armed Robbery at Arcade Center on North Martin Luther King Blvd. Tallahassee Police Department

The Tallahassee Police Department is investigating two armed robberies that happened an hour and a half apart the night of April 26 on two different sides of town.

TPD posted dramatic video Thursday afternoon on Twitter of a robbery that happened around 9 p.m. at the Arcade Center, 1889 N. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.

The video, nearly a minute and a half long, shows a man walking into the business and firing a gun into the ceiling as he approached the front desk clerk and demanded money.

The man tried to fire the gun several times before it finally went off, startling a customer who was standing right next to him. Customers appeared oblivious to the gunman at first, though they later put their heads down on the tables in front of them. No injuries were reported.

The other incident, an armed mugging, happened around 10:30 p.m. outside the CVS Pharmacy, 5466 Thomasville Road, according to a heavily redacted police report.

A woman tried to fend off the mugger in the drug store parking lot, but her attacker made off with a wallet containing her credit cards. She told officers someone pointed a gun in her face and demanded she hand over her purse. She was not injured, according to the TPD report.

A Good Samaritan later found the woman's wallet and returned it to her. He posted on the Next Door website that she initially refused to give the mugger her purse but turned it over after realizing he had a gun. The mugger got into a car that sped away.

TPD didn't post any information about the mugging on its Facebook or Twitter pages and didn't issue a press release. Citizens have complained to city commissioners, the Police Department and the Tallahassee Democrat about the fact the mugging was not publicized.

No arrests have been made in either incident. Both remain under investigation.

1286,"Popular Fort Myers statues leaving downtown, moving all over the city","They might be the most popular residents of downtown Fort Myers: The chess players. The juggler. The dancer. Even the dude peeing on the lamp post.

Especially the dude peeing on the lamp post.

“That one’s very popular!” says Robin Harkey, 64, of North Fort Myers, who works in downtown Fort Myers and has a clear view of the man and his dog on Hendry Street. “People are always taking photos of it, and they’re posing all the time.”

Those larger-than-life statues are always out on the street, doing their thing.

But not for much longer.

Most of the 24 metal statues will soon head to other places in Fort Myers. It’s part of a plan by Fort Myers' Public Art Committee to disperse the city's public-art collection to areas outside of downtown, where most of that collection is concentrated.

“We want to spread out the art we’ve acquired to all six wards,” says longtime committee member Ava Roeder. “I think it’s really exciting.”

The idea is to create miniature “art hubs” throughout the city featuring the artfully rusted statues by Colombian sculptor Edgardo Carmona, says Tom Hall, the city’s public art consultant. The hubs will feature signs and information about connecting to Otocast, a mobile app that will include information about the statues and the rest of the city’s public art collection.

Councilwoman Gaile Anthony says the move will bring more culture to all six wards, including her own Ward 6, where she hopes to place statues at a park planned for The Forum shopping center. That culture is much needed in her ward, she says.

“There’s no art,” she says. “There’s no library. There’s nothing.”

Spreading the art around will help create a feeling of unity in Fort Myers, too, she says. Now everyone can share the art and take pride in it.

“This ties us all together as city,” Anthony says.

The statues arrived in the River District in 2016 as part of a publicity campaign for downtown luxury condominiums Allure (that’s why the collection was previously called “Allure Your Senses”). They were supposed to stay for just three months. But then the exhibit got extended. And then it got extended again.

Finally, last August, the Fort Myers City Council voted to buy 23 of those statues for $55,000 and make them permanent residents of Fort Myers (the 24th sculpture would be part of the Allure condominium complex). The purchase wasn’t publicized much, though, and many people still don’t know the city owns the statues.

Victoria Yoraschek, 37, walks by them every day on her way to work on First Street, but she says she had no idea the statues were city property now.

“It’s really cool,” the Fort Myers resident says. “They add to the atmosphere in downtown, along with Art Walk and some of the galleries.”

Now some of that atmosphere will be leaving and taking up residence elsewhere. And Lee County residents have mixed opinions about the move, judging from people interviewed recently by The News-Press in downtown.

“I think they should stay here,” says Richard Ahlborn, 74, of Cape Coral as he sips coffee outside of Starbucks. “They belong together. It’s just part of the culture in downtown now.”

But Terry Tincher — a local art dealer who works as general manager at the new Seed & Bean Market — likes the idea of the entire city gaining access to the sculptures. Besides, he says, there are way too many of those statues jammed into downtown right now.

“It’s crazy to have 24 sculptures in a seven-block area,” says Tincher, 63, of Fort Myers. “They’re just stacked on top of each other, and that takes away from the artistic flair for the city. There are just too many.”

Eight of the statues will remain in downtown Fort Myers, while the other 15 will get split evenly among the city’s other five awards. Where they’ll be going, exactly, is still being worked out.

The statues staying in downtown will include the unicycle juggler, the boy fishing, the snow-cone vendor, the ribbon dancer, the two drunks on a park bench, the man listening to a radio and — yes — the man and his dog urinating against a light post.

When that last statue debuted in 2016, some people didn’t like it and considered the man’s exposed penis to be obscene. But city leaders and the Public Art Committee discussed the statue (officially called “Territorio” or “territory”) and decided to keep it, says Donna Lovejoy, the city’s public art liaison.

“Art is art,” Lovejoy says,” and it shouldn’t be censored.”

Besides, she points out, that statue remains one of the most popular ones in downtown. People are always posing for photos next to that man and his dog at the corner of Hendry and Main streets, Lovejoy says. “That’s always been a huge conversation piece — good, bad or indifferent.”

The rest of the statues could all be moved permanently within the next nine months, Hall says. City officials are still working out the details, including how much the move will cost and how, exactly, the statues will be moved. Each statue weighs between 200 and about 1,000 pounds and stands 7 to 10 feet tall.

The statues' creator, Edgardo Carmona, didn’t respond to several requests for comment via his daughter Carolina Carmona Montenegro, who was serving as an interpreter for The News-Press. But Hall, Anderson and other city officials say Carmona has said he doesn’t want the collection broken up.

“The artist hates the idea,” Hall says. “He wants to see his 23 pieces all kept together in close proximity. The committee, though, felt that it’s imperative that all of the wards be able to participate in the artworks.”

Carmona visited the city in January 2016 for the unveiling of the statues. Through an interpreter, the Spanish-speaking artist said he built the statues using hydraulic machines, sandblasting and a special method to remove the calamine from the rust and stop the oxidation process.

The rust, he said, gives each piece a pleasing, colorful patina. “It’s intentional.”

The city bought the collection from Carmona for $55,000. Lovejoy, however, says the statues were technically “donated” to the city. She estimated that they’re worth at least $20,000 or $30,000 each, but Carmona only required that the city reimburse him for the cost of the steel, alone.

“We really got them for a steal — all of them for just $55,000,” says committee member Roeder. “That’s crazy!”

Mayor Randy Henderson says he considers that money well-spent. “The sculptures have created excitement, interest, controversy, discussion and much more in downtown and beyond.”

He’s a fan, too. “I find the sculptures quite interesting, playful, a snapshot of life, vitality, action, whimsical, etc.,” he says. “It contributes to our quality of life in Fort Myers.”

Councilwoman Teresa Watkins Brown says she loves the idea of all Fort Myers residents getting to enjoy Carmona’s art — not just the people who visit downtown.

“(They) will now receive the benefit of seeing art displayed in their neighborhoods or wards,” she says. “I feel this is a great move by our city to share the pieces around.”

Meanwhile, the statues continue to be a big draw to downtown Fort Myers.

“They’re very popular picture subjects,” Lovejoy says. “Young or old, it doesn’t matter.”

An incident report says the trooper spotted a ""medically distressed"" man on the side of Florida's Turnpike Thursday afternoon. When the trooper went to get water for him, Shane Jensen jumped into the patrol car and sped away.

As Jensen drove north, Osceola County sheriff's deputies deployed stop sticks. Jenson avoided them but eventually stopped and ran into the woods. He was arrested a short time later.

Authorities say Jensen carjacked a teenager in Clearwater on Wednesday. In addition to those charges, he's now facing charges of stealing a patrol car and reckless driving.

1288,Deadly shooting is latest black eye for internet cafes,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A man who was shot and killed while attempting to stop a robbery at an internet cafe is the latest victim in a plague of violence reported at sweepstakes centers.

On Thursday, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office was still searching for the shooter who killed a customer Wednesday at the Dream Arcade on Edgewood Avenue North in the Biltmore neighborhood. Investigators said the man tried to intervene.

In March 2018, Raymond Dixon, 23, and Raheem Prather, 28, were shot and killed by a security guard during a holdup at Spin City Sweepstakes Internet Cafe on Beach Boulevard. Investigators said Dixon and Prather were both attempting to rob the arcade.

In December 2018, Timothy King, 26, was shot and wounded by a security guard. Investigators said he was attempting to rob the Cyber Spot game room on 103rd Street.

In January, the Sheriff's Office said Lawrence Hall robbed the Lucky Charms Arcade on Mayport Road. It led to a carjacking, high-speed chase and crash that resulted in the death of an 84-year-old man.

Neighbors who live near the Dream Arcade, like Jasmine Allen, are frustrated after Wednesday night's deadly shooting.

""It's unfortunate that man got hit in the crossfire in regard to just trying to be a good Samaritan. It's sad, it really is,"" Allen said. ""God willing, I hope whoever did it gets caught.""

News4Jax visited other internet cafes around Jacksonville. In addition to security guards, some have doors that remain locked during business hours.

Workers at the Copacabana internet cafe on Normandy Boulevard said they've had few issues with crime.

""We've got cameras. People are watching,"" said Patrice Quinn who has worked at Copacabana for seven years. ""It's fun. Good atmosphere.""

Quinn said a neighboring game room, which is under the same ownership, had a robbery that was foiled a few years ago. She said in that case, the robbers were caught.

The Northside Coalition of Jacksonville sent a letter to the City Council asking it to limit the number of internet cafes in a certain area and to provide better security.

According to the fire department, the man was inside the dumpster when the truck emptied it.

The truck then compacted the trash.

There is no word on how the workers realized the man was inside.

Firefighters were called in. They attached a large metal basket to their aerial ladder and lifted the man out.

1292,Deland man gets life sentence for fatal car theft,"- A Florida man has been sentenced to life in prison for killing another man and stealing his car.

The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports that 23-year-old Emmanuel Butler was sentenced Wednesday. He was convicted in 2016 of first-degree premeditated murder and first-degree felony murder and robbery with a firearm. The sentencing was delayed by appeals that were eventually won by prosecutors.

Authorities say Butler attacked 67-year-old Donald Clark in a laundry room at Golfview Apartments in South Daytona in June 2013. Investigators say Butler shot Clark in the back of the head and then drove off in the man's Mitsubishi Galant. The car was abandoned a short time later.

Butler's cousin Renard Miller is serving 20 years for being an accessory after the fact.

1299,Florida man busted for singing dirty song to neighbor,"WILDWOOD, Fla. - Perhaps next time one Florida man will stick to the classics when attempting to impress a woman with a song.

Robert Mirabella, 62, was arrested Saturday after he played guitar and sang an original song to a woman he was serenading.

What got him in trouble was that Mirabella was sitting on the woman's porch and the song contained words not normally found in friendlier tunes.

According to the arrest report, Mirabella's lyrics contained phrases such as ""There is a neighbor who was a bitch and I see her now, she’s just a witch.”

The Smoking Gun reports the woman claimed to have ongoing issues with her neighbors in The Villages, just north of Orlando.

For his part, Mirabella claimed that he may have sang the song in front of the woman, but it didn't mean it was about her.

Mirabella was arrested for disorderly conduct and plead not guilty.

(Photo: Michael Braun/news-press.com)

The year of Esther Batista's birth was one of great upheaval around the world.

The world was at war in 1917, with the U.S. jumping into the War to End All Wars before the year was half over. The communist revolution upended Russia. Thousands of African-Americans marched in New York City to decry lynching, and the 18th Amendment — prohibition — was approved by Congress and sent to the states for ratification.

Batista, a native of Santiago in the Dominican Republic, celebrated her 102nd birthday Sunday at St. Andrew Catholic Church in Cape Coral, and said the most important thing she has learned in that time has been her faith.

""The faith that my father taught me,"" said the woman whom an entire church calls 'Abuela,' Spanish for grandmother.

""She was brought up going to church,"" said her son, Ramone Batista, 64. ""She was strong in her faith. That's what we recognize as a sample of her. That's what motivates me in my life. It has been a privilege.""

He said her faith is such that when she prays, she has told others, she often sees angels.

During the Spanish-language Mass at the church Sunday, Pastor Eduardo Coll called her up to receive a special blessing.

Other family members agreed that their abuela's hallmark is a strong Christian belief.

""She prays six or seven times a day,"" said Natalie Koa, 30, a granddaughter. ""She is a very passionate person.""

She remains very active and viable at 102, walking only with a little help from a wooden cane. In fact, she has plans to fly to see relatives in the Dominican Republic later this week, something she does on a regular basis.

""She takes care of herself very well,"" her son said. ""She is phenomenal.""

As of the 2010 U.S. census, of the 618,754 residents in Lee County, there were only 104 — 17 men and 87 women — between 100 and 104. There were only four men and eight women between 105 and 109 and none 110 or older.

A decade earlier, during the 2000 census, the population was 440,888, and those older than 100 were even fewer, 16 men and 68 women, between 100 and 104 and only two men and four women between 105 and 109. However, there were three women 110 or older.

Batista is surrounded by five generations of her family who live in Lee County. She has six children and 26 grandchildren and too many great- and great-great-grandchildren to accurately count, the family jokes.

Esther Batista, who speaks no English, has seen quite a bit of life flow by and has been surprised by some things. But the one thing that modern times have brought her that she enjoys is communication through new technology.

""Being able to Facetime her children in the Dominican Republic,"" granddaughter Esther O'Keefe said.

Along with Esther Batista's passion and faith is a strong will. Koa said her grandmother is always giving her advice about life.

""She says, 'Stay strong',"" Koa said. ""She's always giving her two cents.""

O'Keefe agreed with that and added that her grandmother is often blunt, but in a good way.

""She's the person everyone comes to when they have trouble,"" she said. ""And they walk away with joy. She gets a lot of love at her church.""

1307,Unlicensed contractor who already served prison time under investigation again,"NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) - Two families in the Trinity neighborhood of Pasco County say an unlicensed contractor ran off with their money and left them with a mess.

The contractor was busted by a Better Call Behnken investigation in 2016 and served two years in prison.

Charlene and Kurt Lichssenring hired smooth-talking James Lineback to do electrical work. He took $650, cut holes, left exposed wires all over the house and then disappeared.

Next door, Rose Ciccione paid Lineback $200 to replace screens in her windows. She says he took off with the screens and her money, then blocked her calls and text messages.

""I know it's not thousands of dollars, but my screens alone are worth more than $200,"" she said.

Back in 2016, Lineback was accused of taking off with an elderly man's diamond ring, tools and even his Jeep.

Lineback served two years in prison. The Pasco County Sheriff's Office found he solicited yard work, then his girlfriend would show up, offering to clean, and then items would end up missing.

That worries Charlene because she tells me Lineback asked her multiple times if his wife could have coffee with her while he worked.

When she refused, he disappeared.

1310,Judge: Public defender must represent Parkland shooting suspect,"- A judge ruled that the public defender must continue representing the man charged in last year's Florida high school massacre because he is unlikely to obtain a large inheritance left by his mother.

Judge Elizabeth Scherer ruled Friday that Broward County public defenders must represent 20-year-old Nikolas Cruz. The office recently asked to be removed from the case because the former Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student could receive $432,000 before taxes from his late mother's annuity. Under state law, the office can only represent indigent defendants.

Scherer ruled Cruz hasn't applied for the money and if he did, it would likely be claimed through lawsuits filed by his victims' families.

Cruz's attorneys say he would plead guilty to killing 17 for a life sentence. Prosecutors want the death penalty.

1312,"CCSO: East Naples man arrested, accused of holding and sexually battering teenage girl","CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

An East Naples man accused of holding a teenage girl overnight and sexually battering her was arrested Thursday.

Jose Amaya, 51, picked the girl up from her home on Monday and brought her to JD Auto Repair, where he lived and worked, according to an arrest report from the Collier County Sheriff’s Office.

Amaya was an acquaintance of the victim and knew her from doing auto repairs for her family. The victim was supposed to clean Amaya’s office in exchange for the work he did for her family, according to the report.

The victim, whose name and age were redacted from the report to protect her identity, was from out of the country and moved to the U.S. with her father. Her father was killed in a biking accident shortly after, according to the report.

After her father died, the victim began living with a woman in Golden Gate. After she cleaned Amaya’s office, he refused to take her home, according to the sheriff’s office report.

The victim wanted to leave the auto repair shop but saw Amaya secure the exterior of the door with a key as he left and thought she was locked inside the building with no way out, according to the report.

The victim has a kindergarten education and is timid like a young child, according to the sheriff's office.

Amaya took her cellphone before leaving the auto repair shop, according to the report.

Once Amaya returned home, he entered the office area where he left the victim and forced her onto a couch inside the office area of the business, according to the report.

Amaya is accused of touching the victim’s genitals with his hands and mouth. The victim asked Amaya to stop and he ignored her, according to the report.

After the sexual battery, the victim got her phone back and sent a message to her caregiver about the incident, which went unanswered, according to the sheriff’s office.

The victim stayed at the repair shop inside the office for the night while Amaya slept outside the office in the garage area of the business.

Early the next morning, Amaya woke up and left to go get coffee. The victim used her cell phone to call 911 and was able to find a way to exit the building where she met responding deputies, according to the sheriff’s office.

Amaya was arrested on Thursday and provided a partial confession to the victim’s allegations, according to his arrest report.

He was charged with sexual battery on a person between the ages of 12 and 18 and false imprisonment, according to court records.

Amaya was transported to the Naples Jail Center and is set to be arraigned on May 28.

1314,Family claims Jacksonville father died in police custody,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Jacksonville family is demanding answers in the sudden death of a 26-year-old man who they say was in police custody at the time.

Witnesses said Jacksonville Sheriff’s officers were called Tuesday evening to a food store near Lane Avenue and Londontowne Lane.

Loved ones of 26-year-old Jalen Mays said he was detained at the business and then taken to the hospital. He died Thursday morning.

The Sheriff's Office did not notify media outlets of the death. News4Jax only learned Mays died once his family called the station asking for help.

Multiple attempts by News4Jax to reach the agency for comment on Mays' death were unsuccessful.

“He meant the world to all of us,” said Mays’ mother Jerry Lynette Clark. “He did not live a perfect life, but he was perfect to me in my eyes.”

Clark said the 26-year-old was at a convenience store Tuesday afternoon when he got into an argument with a man. Someone called 911.

“He resisted when the police got there,” Clark said. “It was reported that he was hogtied and taken away from the scene.”

Loved ones don't know much about what happened afterward, except that Mays ended up on life support at Orange Park Medical Center. Within a day, he was dead.

The man's family members are raising concerns about what they saw when they visited his body. Clark noted that he had bruises, scrapes and scratches, as well as swelling and abrasions on his wrists.

“What caused his organs to fail?” she wondered. “What caused him to go into cardiac arrest?”

Family members showed the News4Jax I-TEAM pictures of Mays, taken after his death. They’re too graphic to release, but they appear to show swelling and blood as the family contends.

Mays’ relatives said officers told them he died from substance abuse. They're not convinced.

“My brother was victimized,” said Mays' younger brother, Bri’Shod. “He did not deserve to get treated like that. Whatever it was, I’m sure it could’ve been handled a whole different way. You’re supposed to be detained in a different manner. But it wasn’t that.”

The family is now calling for an autopsy and explanation as to what happened to Mays. As of Thursday afternoon, an autopsy was not scheduled.

News4Jax on Thursday visited the store where the incident is said to have taken place. A clerk there confirmed there was surveillance footage, but he said detectives took it with them.

“This happens on the regular,” said Bri’Shod Mays. “It seems to not be brought up to the public on a daily basis.”

Relatives said they were assuming the worst with the death of the father of four.

“What happened?” Clark asked with tears welling in her eyes. “That’s all I really want to know. What happened? So that my family, his kids, can have closure.”

1315,"'Ma, he shot me:' Suspect shoots girlfriend's son in Parramore, police say","ORLANDO, Fla. - An argument that started with one man calling another ""funny looking"" led to that man shooting his girlfriend's son Wednesday evening, according to the Orlando Police Department.

Witnesses said they were hanging out at a residence on McFall Avenue in the Parramore area when Reginald Ryles arrived there and began playing loud music in an attempt to disturb them. The group went outside to hang out on the front porch and Ryles followed them, giving the group dirty looks, according to the report.

Ryles then told his girlfriend's son that he was ""funny looking"" and the two men started fighting, police said. Two of the victim's friends also got involved in the fight.

The victim's mother said that Ryles went inside the house after the fight to get a gun, then came back outside and fired multiple shots, the report said.

""Ma, he shot me,"" the victim said after being shot on the right side of his chest near his armpit, according to the affidavit.

Police said Ryles fled after the shooting but later returned to the crime scene to turn himself in.

The victim was transported to a local hospital in stable condition, according to authorities.

Ryles faces charges of attempted first-degree murder, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, attempted aggravated battery and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.

1316,"In wolf mask and Batman PJs, Pensacola man tortured child for cameras, report says","One video shows the exhausted toddler stumbling and lying down on the floor, then a masked man appearing in frame, grabbing her by the neck and dragging her out of view, according to investigators.

The next video reportedly shows the 2-year-old running and screaming while a man in a wolf mask and Batman pajama pants follows her, a cellphone held high in one hand and electric shock device crackling in the other.

Another video simply records the exhausted child swaying back and forth near her bed, forcing herself to stay awake as she watches her bedroom door.

Andrew Bennett Celaius' arrest report describes about a dozen of the videos that were seized from a Betty Road residence. Most of them reportedly show strange, senseless, callous acts of cruelty that were seemingly inflicted specifically for the cameras.

Celaius, 37, was arrested April 9 when deputies investigating the child's injuries found Celaius in possession of ammunition and illegal narcotics. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan announced in a press conference Wednesday that Celaius is now facing multiple counts of child cruelty after an investigators found the child had endured ""systematic torture"" at his hands.

Deputies recovered footage from a home surveillance camera in the home that reportedly showed numerous instances of filmed abuse occurring over a roughly two-month span.

In two videos, Celaius enters the child's room as she sleeps and hurls a liquid-filled baby bottle at her chest. In another, he throws a house cat on her face as she sleeps, startling her awake, the report states.

Multiple videos allegedly show the child being shot in the head and stomach with a BB gun.

Per the report:

""(The victim) is seen holding her hands on each side of her face. (The victim) is also recorded glancing at her bedroom door seconds before the 'gun shot' sound is heard again. (The victim) begins to cry as she appears to have been hit with the projectile in the head.""

While (victim) stands in the same spot crying in pain, she is again struck in the head and her cries turn to a scream while she holds her head in her hands. A reload sound is heard seconds before (victim) is struck for the third time, also in the head. Her hair is clearly seen moving as the projectile makes contact with her skin.

(The victim) remains standing in the same place while holding her head in her hands, screaming and crying in pain until this video comes to an end.""

According to the arrest reports, Celaius does at times appear in the videos, often holding what appears to be a recording cellphone in his hand. The report indicates that at times he wore a wolf mask or a ""evil clown mask,"" along with camouflage pants or Batman pajama pants.

When deputies searched the home, they reportedly found the masks, the pants, a stun gun, several airsoft guns and BB guns with BB pellets. They also reported finding several prescription medications but no active prescription.

Investigators recovered a rechargeable dog shock collar and remote in a backyard shed. There was no evidence of a dog living on the property.

After Caelaius was arrested, he allegedly made a call from Escambia County Jail telling a friend, Eric Furnans to go to his house and ""disintegrate two black frogs"" because they were ""poisonous."" Deputies interpreted the message as code for two cellphones, which were later found hidden in a microwave. Both men were charged with tampering with evidence.

Celaius ultimately had 10 counts of child abuse added to his possession charges, according to the arrest report.

On Wednesday, after the sheriff announced the new charges, and according to county staff, Celaius was transferred out of general population into protective custody immediately afterward.

On Wednesday night, he was transported to a local hospital, but county officials said patient privacy laws prevent them from disclosing why.

Whatever the cause of the transport, county staff confirmed it is nonfatal, meaning Celaius will presumably return to jail and be held without bond pending his trial.

1317,"Man shoots gun because people wouldn't leave community pool, police say","ORMOND BEACH, Fla. - A man who was upset that three people wouldn't leave a community pool, despite the fact that it was still open, fired a gun in an attempt to get them to vacate, according to the Ormond Beach Police Department.

Two juveniles and an adult were at the pool on Willow Run around 9 p.m. when Richard Marcelle, 66, approached them and said the pool was closed and they needed to leave, the report said.

The victims, one of whom lives in the community, initially apologized and were gathering their things to leave when they noticed the sign listing the pool rules said the pool was open until 10 p.m.

The victims confronted Marcelle in front of the clubhouse and told him that they were going to stay because the pool was still open. Police said Marcelle told them that he's a member of the homeowners association so he knows that the rules will be changing soon, although residents had not yet been notified.

Marcelle blocked the victims as they tried to get back into the pool area and then fired a small revolver-style handgun at the soil, according to the affidavit.

One of the victims asked Marcelle, ""Did you really just shoot a gun?""

Marcelle replied, ""Yes, I am putting my own life at risk,"" police said.

Marcelle then followed the victims, with the gun still in his hand, as they got into their vehicle, according to the report.

Surveillance video helped police identify Marcelle as a suspect in the case. It also showed that the victims were never armed or threatening toward Marcelle at any time during the encounter, authorities said.

Marcelle was arrested Wednesday on three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill.

1318,"Fort Lauderdale man accused of repeatedly beating 3 children at home, gym","Jayce Ja'von Monroe, 32, is accused of beating his three young children.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A Fort Lauderdale man was arrested Wednesday on three counts of aggravated child abuse for repeatedly beating his three young children at his home, inside his car and at his gym, authorities said.

According to an arrest report, Jayce Ja'von Monroe, 32, beat his children with extension cords and belts, causing permanent scars throughout their bodies.

Fort Lauderdale police said child protective investigators first interviewed the children on April 5.

Police said one of the children had several open and scabbed lash marks to his arms.

He told investigators his father beat him with an extension cord for writing a bad word on the sidewalk outside Monroe's gym -- JJ's Boxing Gym at 1782 NW 38th Ave. in Lauderhill, authorities said.

According to the arrest report, one child had 29 ""linear"" and ""curvilinear"" new and old loop marks throughout their body. The child told investigators Monroe struck the victim with a cord while they were inside the father's Ford SUV in the parking lot of the gym, authorities said.

Police said another child had wounds on their shoulders, triceps, biceps, forearms, back, sides of their chest, waist, front thighs, ankles and calves.

During another interview with the children on April 23, one of the victims told investigators he gets hit by his father for bad behavior with a cord or with a belt on his arms and legs.

Police said the child told investigators, ""I get lucky sometimes and don't bleed.""

According to the arrest report, the child said the most recent beating occurred at Monroe's gym and said, ""He whopped me and when he saw me bleeding, he felt bad and put cocoa butter on it.""

Police said Monroe took his children to Taco Bell after the incident, but did not get the child who was beaten any food.

Authorities said Monroe's wife, who is the mother of his three children, was also interviewed by investigators and was aware that her husband beat one of their children March 27 for writing the bad word on the sidewalk. She said she saw the injuries March 30 while at her child's track meet.

Investigators said the child's injuries were still healing nearly a month after the beating.

According to the arrest report, the woman said she had called Women in Distress to help her and her children escape future abuse from Monroe.

Monroe is being held at the Broward County Main Jail.

1319,Pensacola man accused of 'torturing' toddler transported from jail to hospital,"A Pensacola man accused of torturing his girlfriend's toddler with a shock collar and other implements was rushed from Escambia County Jail to a hospital late Thursday night.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, was arrested April 9 on drug and weapon possession charges and violation, according to an arrest report. In a press conference Wednesday, Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan announced Celaius was facing a second round of charges related to ""systemic torture"" of a young girl in his household.

According to a Escambia County spokesperson, after the new charges were announced, Celaius was transferred out of the jail's general population and into protective custody. Nonetheless, Celaius was transported to the hospital around 11 p.m. Wednesday.

Arrest: Pensacola man accused of 'systematic torture' and 'indescribable' abuse of 2-year-old

A county spokeswoman said because of patient privacy laws, she could not discuss the reason for the transport other than to say it was not fatal and that Celaius remained hospitalized.

During the press conference, Morgan described Celaius' alleged abuses as ""truly heinous,"" and said deputies had seized hours of self-recorded video of Celaius abusing the toddler.

Some of the allegations are that Celaius hit the girl with objects to keep her from sleeping, shocked her with an electric dog collar he placed around her neck and burned her with a lighter.

Celaius was being held in Escambia County Jail without bond, so he will presumably return to jail when he is discharged from the hospital. At this time, it is unclear how long Celaius will remain hospitalized.

1320,Man gets prison for smuggling turtles in candy wrappers,"- A Florida man has been sentenced to a year in prison for his part in a reptile smuggling ring that stretched from South Carolina to Hong Kong.

The State reports Matthew Harrison Kail was sentenced Tuesday for the scheme that involved hiding rare turtles in candy wrappers or socks and shipping them overseas.

Prosecutors said Kail was a key part of the operation, which was led in South Carolina by Steven Verren Baker. Baker, of Georgia, was ordered in March to serve just over a year in prison. Authorities have said Baker's one of South Carolina's most well-known wildlife traders.

The newspaper says these are believed to be the state's first prison sentences for illegal wildlife trading. Several other people in the scheme have been sentenced to probation and fines.

1321,Deaf rescue dog learns sign language after 'fairy tale' adoption by man who is also deaf,"A man born deaf adopted a puppy who is also deaf in a story ""with an absolute fairy tale ending.""

Nick Abbott, 31, told WABI-5 that he saw a Facebook post about Emerson from NFR Maine, a foster-based dog rescue.

""I said, 'Oh, he's deaf, too,'"" Abbott told the TV station. ""Maybe I can go check him out to see what he's all about.""

Emerson was rescued from Florida when he was 6 weeks old. He had experienced seizures and was infected with canine parvovirus, a contagious virus affecting dogs that can be fatal if left untreated.

""Once we got him home from the vet's office from Florida, we realized he had hearing difficulties,"" Lindsay Powers with NFR Maine told Good Morning America on Tuesday. ""He had such a rough start to life.""

Cute alert: Blind dog gets his own 'seeing eye' dog. Excuse us, we can't see through happy tears

All of Emerson's siblings were adopted quickly, but ""our sweet boy Emerson"" was still looking for a home, the dog rescue group said in its Facebook post.

""He wants everyone to know that even though he may be deaf, he is still an AMAZING little pup with SOO much love to give!""

When Abbott first visited Emerson, the dog came right to him and sat at his feet, Abbott told WABI-5.

""He kind of picked me. And I knew right then and there that we would get along and understand each other pretty good,"" he said.

Since then, Abbott has been teaching Emerson sign language commands.

The letter S is ""sit,"" and sweeping his hand across in a straight line is ""lie down,"" WABI-5 reported.

""If Nick reaches up and shakes his ear lobe, Emerson will bark – it's so cute,"" Abbott's mom, Richelle, told Good Morning America.

""The bond that we have is awesome,"" Abbott told WABI-5. ""We understand each other very well. I'd like to think it was meant to be. He's special.""

An 18-year-old Orlando man who Indialantic police said led officers on a chase through a residential area before calling for a Lyft, was arrested, reports show.

Jancarlos Nathaniel Torres was charged with aggravated fleeing with injury or damage after an Indialantic police officer working night patrol spotted a Toyota sedan speeding through a neighborhood in the beachside town overnight Tuesday.

The officer turned on his emergency lights and followed the vehicle to a dead end.

Police said the driver, later identified as Torres, drove the Toyota straight toward the officer and then turned left onto several yards, smashing sprinkler heads along the way.

Torres, said police, then drove through several stop signs and fled the area.

A short time later, a Melbourne Beach police officer located the Toyota, with a flat tire and front end damage, in Rykman Park.

The officer watched as a Lyft rideshare driver pulled up and announced that he was there to pick up a client. Within moments two people — including Torres — stepped out of the shadows, police reported.

Torres was arrested and searched, with officers locating the Toyota’s keys in his front pocket.

Torres told officers he fled from police and made a mistake. He was transported to the Brevard County Jail Complex in Sharpes. No court dates have been set.

1323,Florida State fans celebrate '11' at final Mike Martin Luncheon,"This season has been one of celebrations for Florida State baseball coach Mike Martin.

The University of Virginia presented Martin with an award last Thursday honoring his 40-year career and his accomplishments, including being the first coach in NCAA history to reach 2,000 wins in any sport. The Cavaliers joined a long line of opponents that have presented Martin with an award.

On Tuesday, FSU fans got another opportunity to celebrate the career of the man known as ""Eleven"" for his jersey number at the final Mike Martin Luncheon. Martin is retiring at season's end after 40 years as the Seminoles' coach.

""It’s beyond surreal,"" said Shannon Thomas, Zookeeper for the Animals of Section B - FSU's renowned baseball fan group.

""Every time we have something and it’s the last one I feel like I’m going to burst into tears. Even though I’m happy and it’s been so wonderful. I was expecting a large turnout… I love them so much. Eleven and Mrs. Carol have been very supportive of The Animals. I hope that they teach the next person that and it carries on.""

Almost 100 people showed for the event at the FSU Alumni Center, including FSU President John Thrasher, Seminole Boosters President and CEO Andy Miller, and Seminole Boosters Chairman Doug Russell.

For nearly everyone in attendance, their reason for celebrating Martin was different. For one fan, what stood out was the way Martin treated everyone from his players and his coaches to the fans who showed to support his team.

""He’s always so personable and real,"" FSU fan Diane Piroth said. ""When you go to Fan Day and that stuff it’s like you’ve known him for years.""

It's that personal bond with Martin that connected everyone in attendance. He has gone out of his way to make people feel welcome and at home over the years, and it shows in their memories of him.

""I used to be on the board of directors for the Jacksonville Seminole Club, and we used to do a golf tournament specifically for the baseball team every October,"" FSU fan Andrea Murray said.

""Every fall was a memorable moment because it was just us and coach at the Deerwood Country Club in Jacksonville. And that was special because he knew that everything we raised that day went specifically to his boys. He was pretty tickled about that.

""His leadership and the example that he sets for everyone. He’s going to leave some tough shoes to fill.""

Martin has had many standout victories over the past 40 years with many different players. He has led the Seminoles to 16 College World Series appearances, appearing in the championship games in 1986 and 1999.

For some, the games in Omaha, Nebraska, — home of the CWS — were the ones they'll remember the most as he continues to chase a first national title. For some, it was the record-setting wins.

And for others, it was being part of the magic.

""I think it was probably the Super Regional in 2008 when we beat Wichita State,"" said Eric Luallen, the voice of FSU baseball.

""That ended the longest dry spell for going to Omaha at least during his time. The longest span that they’d had without going to Omaha. That win in the third game against Wichita had a good feeling to it … That felt pretty special to me. Partly because of the long dry spell and partly because it was the first time that I was a part of the team getting to Omaha.""

This final season has been a trying one for Martin and his team, but they're starting to head in the right direction.

The Seminoles (24-14, 12-9 ACC) have resurrected their season over the last two weeks with a home sweep of then No. 16 Clemson and a road series win over Virginia.

Martin was upbeat about what he's seen from his squad during his speech at the luncheon, praising the players' resiliency and composure.

Martin closed the event out by thanking everyone who showed. He appeared genuinely grateful that so many people made time to attend.

""I can’t express to you the feeling that I had,"" Martin told the Tallahassee Democrat.

""For people to block off an hour and a half of their day and to have the President here, that was overwhelming. There were six or seven of my golf buddies here. It was extremely rewarding. It made me feel really good that people would take the time out of their busy schedule to support Seminole baseball.""

But the season isn't over and Martin isn't ready to start taking the trips down memory lane. That will come later.

Right now, it's all about finishing his 40th and final season with a bang.

""I can’t afford to let anything get in the way of our goal,"" Martin said.

""If I did I think it would be selfish to think of myself when we have signs up in our clubhouse that say it’s about us. There’s a lot of memories, but, good Lord willing, I’ll have a lot of time to reflect on those memories after this season. I want to see our young men have an opportunity to accomplish our goals.""

1324,Fake officer pulls over real undercover officer in Florida,"PLANT CITY, Fla. - Authorities say a Florida man impersonating an officer flipped the red and blue lights on his SUV while unknowingly trying to stop a car with a real officer.

The Tampa Bay Times reports 26-year-old Matthew Erris was arrested on a charge of impersonating a public officer.

An arrest report says Erris turned on the red and blue lights on his SUV in Plant City, Florida to try to stop the car in front of him.

The driver was an undercover Hillsborough County sheriff's detective in an unmarked car. He didn't pull over. Instead he called dispatchers to alert other deputies, who later stopped Erris.

Erris admitted he installed the lights and used them to get through heavy traffic.

Columnist note: This column was updated from the print version to include information provided from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

Last Sunday morning was truly a sabbath designed by God. One of those work-of-art Sundays where the the sky is so clear and the sun is so warm and outside world is so glorious that it demands dropping the -g off of ""morning"" when you pronounce the word. I’m talkin’ about a good mornin’!

With gospel music on the radio and kayaks strapped into the back of the pickup truck, my adorable wife and I spun off I-10, westbound onto Nine Mile Road en route to the Perdido River. As we rolled past the sprawling and seemingly ever-evolving campus of Navy Federal we rolled down the window to suck in some sunshine.

And instead, we inhaled odor. The odor. International Paper odor — that thick, spongy gas that coats your tongue and somehow smells and tastes yellow. It's the official government-sanctioned odor of Escambia County, don't you know!

There it was — a miraculous made-by-the-Lord morning sullied by a made-by-man odor.

And there we were, driving past Navy Federal, the most dynamic job-creator in Pensacola, a forward-thinking, full-steam-ahead seeker of talent with the potential for an entire community to spring up around it — a soon-to-be-employer of 10,000 people — and its airspace is tainted by the stench from a decades-old paper mill that produces about 400 jobs seven miles to the north.

There it was, quite literally, Escambia County’s past and future colliding in a single location, the story of a place boiled down to fundamental physics. It was observable states of matter: The solid, sprawling success of Navy Federal — and the gaseous remnants of an ancient polluter haunting heavily over Escambia's promise for progress.

By the time we reached the water, thankfully, the riverbank was stank-free. The Perdido River, anointed as “Outstanding Florida Waters” by the state of Florida, had some gospel music of its own going on. As the dark waters flowed slick beneath our bright plastic boats, an infinite and invisible choir wove a birdsong on columns of oxygen that flowed perpendicular to the river, just above our paddles and heads.

We were accompanied by my adorable in-laws, West and Amy Calhoun. As Pensacola natives who grew up in the area, working for years as acclaimed custom home builders, they are well familiar with the pained legacy of the stench that greeted us on the drive down to the river. With the obvious contrast of the infamous aroma and the surrounding nature, West shared something he had read in the most recent newsletter from Friends of Perdido Bay and legendary local environmental guardian, Dr. Jackie Lane.

According to Dr. Lane’s report, “the federal permit for IP has expired.” In addition, she wrote that the last state permit from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection had been issued in 2010. “The Florida DEP also issued a Consent Order which expired in March 2019,” she wrote.

Any environmentalist will attest that IP is an age-old enemy of the local waterways, specifically, Eleven Mile Creek and Perdido Bay into which it has dumped many, many millions of gallons of toxic wastewater over the decades. Stricter regulations forced the company to improve some practices in recent decades. But anyone with a half-a brain and a couple nostrils will tell ya, it ain’t exactly Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory that’s operating up there. And the stuff they're dumping in Escambia County's once-pristine waterways is neither edible nor tasty.

And if Dr. Lane is correct, and the company’s permit is indeed expired, then why the heck are they still allowed to be dumping anything in the water at all?

If you or I get caught driving without a license, guess what happens? If a home builder doesn’t get a proper permit, guess what happens? And if a local restaurant is found in violation by the health inspector, guess what happens?

I called the local DEP offices on Wednesday to find out about the current status of IP’s permits. External Affairs Manager Brandy Smith called back Thursday morning. I asked for the current permits and sent her Dr. Lane’s most recent newsletter that alleges the mill is in violation.

At 3:40 p.m. Thursday, the DEP responded by email saying that IP was operating under a 2010 permit that was set to expire in 2015. But, since IP's application for Permit renewal was ""timely and sufficient in accordance with Florida Rule Chapter 62-62 .335 (3)"" (which means 180 days before the expiration date), the 2010 permit remains in effect until the DEP ""takes final agency action on the application.""

Huh? Try that excuse next time your car payment is late.

Essentially, state rules say that even though there is something called an ""expiration date,"" nothing actually ""expires"" if the DEP doesn't get around to approving or denying the permit. Which in this case, has apparently taken the DEP more than 4 years.

Smith said she did not know the specific factors that may have extended the IP permit process for 4 years, but she promised a follow-up phone call to understand why it would take the DEP such a long period of time to ""take final agency action"" — a lack of action which has allowed a notoriously harmful company continue polluting under a permit from a decade ago. Cool.

Smith was very nice and helpful, and honestly, it's probably an impossible challenge to explain the logic of state operations. To average citizens, this stuff seems nuts. What's the point of deadlines, permits and expirations if everyone can just ignore them? And how can a permit for one single business possibly take 4 years to decide on?

I'll update when we get a fuller explanation from DEP. But even if government agencies approve the ongoing operations of Escambia's infamous paper mill, that doesn’t mean the local community should.

There was a day when the mill might have been one of the most important, historic employers in the county. And perhaps there was some economic argument that seemingly justified the destruction of our precious local waterways. But that day has done gone.

As far as important employers go, Navy Federal is the new history-maker in Escambia County. It’s a clean, talent and brain-driven company that has far surpassed any sort of impact the paper mill ever dreamed of having on the region — and without wreaking havoc on natural waterways.

So sucking up the Sunday morning stench outside Navy Federal's campus, the symbolism couldn't be more striking.

How absurd that a dwindling polluter is allowed to literally stink-up the air at a game-changing culture-creator like Navy Federal?

And how foolish that a company that reports about 450 jobs is allowed to continue destroying the environment underneath soon-to-be 10,000 employees at a company who is trying to build a stronger and healthier community in Escambia County?

Heck, Navy Federal could probably hire all 450 mill employees themselves if they wanted to.

So even if you forget the environmental destruction, and even if you look at it from an intensely economic, greed-motivated, Scrooge-McDuck-style point of view, keeping IP around just doesn't make sense.

In other words, what IP is bringing to the bank, just ain’t worth the stank.

We'll have more on all this soon. In the meantime, get outside and enjoy the nature. As long as you can put up with the smell.

1328,Search underway for suspect in alleged burglary interrupted by homeowner,"- Deputies with the Seminole County Sheriff's Office, decked-out in body armor and armed with rifles, joined members of the Sheriff's SWAT Team to comb a wooded area late Friday afternoon, for a suspect on the run.

They are looking for a male suspect, between the Lake Forest and Terracina communities. Earlier in the afternoon, deputies took a man and a woman into custody, after investigators said they bailed out a white sedan that got caught up in some bushes at State Road 46 and International Parkway. However, according to deputies, the trouble started almost ten miles away, on Virginia Avenue in Longwood.

“I heard what sounded like a fire cracker going off. Then it sounded like squealing tires going around the corner, taking off or whatever,” said Chris Davis.

Minutes later, he said the home across the street was surrounded by deputies.

“Cops running around, guns drawn!”

Investigators said the homeowner arrived at that house and interrupted a burglary in progress. Deputies said they believe the burglary suspects were armed and there was some kind of confrontation. That ended with the homeowner shooting one shot at the suspects, before they took off in that white sedan.

“I heard the shot…then two cars coming. The black car come behind the [white one] run all the way like a city mile way down,” said neighbor Juan Rivera.

Deputies have not yet released a description of the suspect who remains at large.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/search-underway-for-suspect-in-alleged-burglary-interupted,2019-05-03T23:53:43Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

1330,FAMU Athletics honor graduates at pre-commencement ceremony,"CLOSE WATCH: Class of 2019 grad Taylor Darks discusses her career on the hardwood and in the classroom at FAMU. Rory Sharrock, Tallahassee Democrat

The commencement ceremony on Saturday is the main event of Florida A&M’s graduation events.

As a prelude to the grand affair, FAMU Athletics hosted a breakfast celebration Friday inside the Hansel Tookes Student Recreation Center.

Thirty-one graduates from the various programs were in attendance to receive their stole and a framed certificate.

Among the speakers at the event were FAMU president Dr. Larry Robinson, athletics director Dr. John Eason, associate athletics director for compliance and SWA Kendra Greene, FAMU deputy athletics director Dr. Genyne Boston and national alumni association president Col. Gregory Clark.

The special send-off from the department was a touching moment for the honorees.

They shared nostalgic moments with teammates and coaches who've assisted them in their collegiate journey.

""I've had some great memories here,"" said Justin Ravenel, FAMU's all-time leader in 3-point field goals.

""In my very first game, I was so nervous. Of course, a lot of 3-pointers and the record breaker. I've hit some buzzer-beaters to send us to overtime. The ESPN games were fun. I've had some good moments since I've been in college and I'll always remember them.""

The occasion also served as a platform for setting future goals of paying it forward to their university.

Taylor Darks, who began her college days at Furman University, played the last two seasons on the women's basketball team. Nevertheless, she is fully committed to giving time and money to FAMU throughout her life.

""As I get ready for graduation, the first thing that comes to mind is what can I give back. What does FAMU need? What wasn't there when I was there? I can't wait to come back to campus and give back what I feel the students need. How can I become that alumnus that does something different?,"" Darks said.

While each individual accolade was noteworthy, perhaps the signature moment of the event occurred when LeRoy Vann accepted his honor.

Vann, who was a two-time All-American at FAMU, last played for the Rattlers in 2009 before embarking upon a pro career.

His NFL journey included stints with the San Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals. Vann also was a member of the Georgia Force, Columbus Lions and San Antonio Talons of the arena league. He spent one season in the CFL with the Montreal Alouettes.

Prior to receiving his gifts, Wilson gave a tearful introduction speech of Vann's perseverance of setting an example for his son by finishing school.

""Ninety-nine percent of the great athletes you see have an edge that comes off as cocky. They have this belief in themselves. LeRoy Vann was a cocky guy when he was here,"" Wilson said.

""He's matured beyond belief. He's turned into a great young man. When we sat down for a 40-minute interview, I could hear the maturity in him and I loved it. That's why we're here - to take them from boys to men. What I see in him is a man.""

The Tampa native never gave up on his dream of obtaining his degree. This Saturday, he'll achieve this milestone in front of family and friends.

""Graduating means a lot more than what some say. If you look at my body of work as an athlete, all of it doesn't amount to being able to walk across this stage and get this degree,"" Vann said.

""In the world we live in today, it's a backbone. That's something that will build a foundation for you to stabilize your family. I felt the need to come back and get this, so I can move forward with my life.""

1332,"Fort Pierce man, 22, who died in car crash remembered by friend as 'the light of everyone'","Brian Santos died May 1 after a car crash. His friends said he loved cars and jet skis. (Photo: Courtesy of Jailene Echevarria)

FORT PIERCE— Brian Santos' passions in life were building and racing cars, said his girlfriend of a year, Jailene Echevarria.

""We loved building cars, but he hated getting grease under his nails,"" she said. ""The car that he crashed in was a Honda that he had just finished building.""

Shayne Stokes, a traffic homicide investigator for the Fort Pierce Police Department, said Santos was driving a Honda Civic Wednesday around noon west in the 700 block of El Rancho Drive.

Stokes said Santos' car veered to the right and went off the road and crashed into two mailboxes, a tree and a telephone pole.

The 22-year-old was dead when Fort Pierce police officers got to the scene, police said. Santos was the only person in the car.

Brian Santos (left) and his girlfriend, Jailene Echevarria (right.) The two planned to have a home and have children one day together. Santos died Wednesday after a car crash. (Photo: Courtesy of Jailene Echevarria)

Echevarria said Santos enjoyed working on his Nissan Infiniti Q50 and had recently finished building the Civic he was driving when he crashed. She said he bought the frame of the Honda and put together the motor, transmission and other parts of the inside of the car.

""He started taking everything apart (on the Honda) and putting new pieces in,"" she said. ""He just made the car the way he wanted it. He was really smart.""

Echevarria said Santos worked at C & L Florida Marble And Granite on Naco Road in Fort Pierce, installing granite counter tops.

She said she spoke with Santos Wednesday morning before she left for work and told him she loved him and kissed him goodbye.

Echevarria said right before the crash, Santos was driving around the block test driving the Honda and then planned to go see his best friend at work.

Brian Santos died Wednesday afternoon after police said his car veered to the right and went off the road. Santos was 22 years old when he died. (Photo: Courtesy of Jailene Echevarria)

Jennifer Garcia met Santos through her husband and said the 22-year-old had a quirky smile and an outgoing personality.

“Brian was the light of everyone,"" Garcia said. “You didn’t need to know him for long for you to just fall in love with Brian.”

Garcia said Santos often joked with her and called her his “gordita,” which means chubby girl, affectionately, in Spanish.

She said Santos turned 22 on April 5 and celebrated his birthday with Garcia’s family.

An investigation is ongoing into the cause of the crash, Stokes said.

""I don't believe drugs or alcohol has played any part in this crash,"" Stokes said.

The Honda was demolished, officers said.

Echevarria said she and Santos talked about having a family of their own one day and buying a house together.

""I just really miss him and I wish whatever happened to him wasn't real,"" she said.

1342,1 arrested in connection with pizza delivery worker robberies,"Tyrance Golfin, 21, of Miami, is accused of robbing two pizza delivery workers in southwest Miami-Dade.

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - One man was arrested this week and another remains on the loose after two pizza delivery workers were robbed over the weekend in southwest Miami-Dade.

The robberies occurred Saturday outside a vacant home at 24045 SW 110th Court.

According to an arrest report, Tyrance Golfin, 21, of Miami, and his accomplice would wait for the delivery workers outside the home before robbing them.

Police said Golfin pulled out a gun on one victim and demanded the victim's cellphone and wallet.

Authorities said the man refused to hand over his belongings and Golfin and his accomplice jumped into the victim's vehicle.

According to the arrest report, the victim ran away and Golfin chased after him before giving up, returning to the car and fleeing the scene.

Golfin is accused of robbing a second pizza delivery worker the same day outside the same vacant home.

Police said Golfin's accomplice asked Golfin if he had change for a $50 bill. Authorities said Golfin then pretended to be getting the money from inside the house, at which time his accomplice stayed outside and talked with the worker.

According to the arrest report, Golfin then turned around and struck the victim on the forehead with an object, causing the victim to stumble to the ground.

Police said the two robbers continued attacking the victim while demanding money.

The victim was eventually able to stand up and entered his vehicle.

Golfin and the second robber took the pizza boxes from the roof of the victim's vehicle and ran away, authorities said.

During the course of the investigation, Golfin was taken into custody by robbery intervention units after bailing out of the stolen vehicle that was taken during the first robbery, authorities said.

Police interviewed Golfin Monday at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center about the pizza delivery robberies, at which time he denied being involved in either incident.

Police said both victims identified Golfin in a photo lineup Wednesday as one of the robbers.

He faces charges of armed robbery and conspiracy to commit an armed robbery.

ST. JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. - A dive team is searching a pond in St. Johns County for the weapon that killed a St. Augustine man just before Christmas, the Sheriff's Office said Thursday.

Everett Davon Thompson was found shot to death in a pickup truck on Poa Boy Farms Road off County Road 214 late last year.

Months later, Vermount James Anderson, 37, was charged with first-degree murder in the case.

ORIGINAL STORY: Man found in pickup truck in St. Johns County died of gunshot wound

According to the Sheriff's Office, Anderson owed Thompson several thousand dollars. On the day he was shot, Thompson went to St. Augustine to meet with Anderson and collect the money he was owed.

As the two men met, the Sheriff's Office said, Anderson pulled out a gun and fired a shot through the open door of the pickup truck, killing Thompson.

A Sheriff's Office spokesman said Thursday that the investigation had led detectives to a pond on Holmes Boulevard in the West Augustine area not far from a middle school. Divers were called in to search the pond for the gun used to kill Thompson.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Maximum Security led the Kentucky Derby every step of the way except for the last one — into the winner’s circle.

The colt became the first winner disqualified for interference in the Derby’s 145-year history, leading to an agonizing wait and an eventual stunning reversal that made 65-1 shot Country House the winner Saturday.

Country House finished second in the slop before objections were raised, causing a 20-minute delay while three stewards repeatedly reviewed different video angles before they unanimously elevated him into the winner’s circle.

That gave Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott his first Derby victory at age 65.

“It’s bittersweet. You always want to win with a clean trip and have everybody recognize the horse as the very good horse and great athlete that he is,” Mott said. “Due to the disqualification, I think some of that is diminished.”

Jockey Flavien Prat, one of two jockeys who originated the claim of foul, also won his first Derby.

“I’m kind of speechless right now,” Prat said, letting out a long sigh.

Country House paid $132.40 to win — the second-highest payout in Derby history. He was the least affected horse in the chain of events, but the biggest beneficiary.

“Looking at the tote board there’s probably a lot of people that didn’t think we could win,” Mott said, “but that’s horse racing.”

Gary West, who owns Maximum Security with his wife, Mary, indicated they may pursue an appeal.

“I think this is the most egregious disqualification in the history of horse racing,” he told The Associated Press by phone, “and not just because it’s our horse.”

Country House was dismissed as a long shot with a bad post on the far outside. It was only the chestnut colt’s second win in seven career starts and his first stakes victory.

Maybe this was one for his father: Lookin At Lucky got saddled with the dreaded No. 1 post in the 2010 Derby, where he got pinned to the rail and wound up sixth. He rebounded to win the Preakness two weeks later.

The disqualification was a crushing turn of events for Maximum Security trainer Jason Servis and jockey Luis Saez, who already had begun celebrating what they thought were their first Derby victories.

Instead, previously undefeated Maximum Security was dropped to 17th of 19 horses for veering out turning for home and stacking up War of Will, Long Range Toddy and Bodexpress (also owned by the Wests), according to Barbara Borden, chief steward of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission. Country House, in turn, was brushed by Long Range Toddy.

Sent off as the 9-2 second choice, Maximum Security was placed behind all the horses that he bothered.

“I never put anybody in danger,” Saez said.

Servis backed up his jockey, saying: “He’s right. He straightened him up right away and I didn’t think it affects the outcome of the race.”

Prat claimed that Maximum Security ducked out in the final turn and forced several horses to steady, including Long Range Toddy, whose jockey, Jon Court, also lodged an objection. War of Will came perilously close to clipping heels with Maximum Security, which could have caused a chain-reaction accident.

“There were two horses in the race that lost all chance to win a Kentucky Derby,” Mott said. “They were in position at the time to hit the board. If what happened to us was the only thing they were looking at I don’t think you would have seen a disqualification.”

Mott said the incident was caused by Maximum Security’s action and not Saez’s riding tactics.

“I don’t think Luis Saez did anything intentionally,” the trainer said. “My heart actually aches for them a little bit. That’s the way it is. I’ve been on the other end of it, just not in the Kentucky Derby.”

The stewards reviewed race footage and interviewed the affected jockeys while keeping the crowd of 150,729 and millions more watching on television and online in suspense, clutching their betting tickets. Trainers and jockeys involved stared at the closest video screen waiting for a result.

“I know the stewards had a very, very difficult decision,” Mott said. “I’m damn glad they put our number up.”

Code of Honor was moved up to second and Tacitus — also trained by Mott — was third.

Improbable was fourth and Game Winner fifth, two of trainer Bob Baffert’s trio of entries. His other horse, Roadster, was 15th.

The last claim of foul by a jockey in the Derby was unsuccessful. John Velazquez, aboard runner-up Invisible Ink in 2001, alleged interference at the quarter pole against Monarchos and Jorge Chavez, who crossed the finish line 4¾ lengths in front. The stewards didn’t change the result.

The only other disqualification in the Derby occurred long after the race in 1968. Dancer’s Image, the first-place finisher, tested positive for a prohibited medication, and Kentucky state racing officials ordered the purse money to be redistributed. Forward Pass got the winner’s share. A subsequent court challenge upheld the stewards’ decision.

Country House wore the garland of red roses, but it’s possible the situation doesn’t end here. There could be appeals to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission or the courts.

“We are exploring our options to appeal,” West told the AP. “If we can’t appeal to the stewards, our other options are the state racing commission. If those don’t work, we might go to legal options.”

Mott hopes it doesn’t come to that.

“That’s a nightmare. It’s a no-win situation for anybody involved,” said Mott, who spoke with Servis after the reversal. “I didn’t get a hint of that from him. He’s been around long enough, and I’m sure he watched the films well enough. He knows what happened.”

The surprising flip threw a few bettors into a frenzy, too. Some who had wagered on Country House to win immediately tossed away their tickets at the finish, only to then scramble to the ground at Churchill Downs, frantically searching for their betting slips.

Master Fencer, the first Japan-bred to run in the Derby, was sixth. War of Will was seventh, followed by Plus Que Parfait, Win Win Win, Cutting Humor, By My Standards and Vekoma.

Bodexpress finished 13th, followed by Tax, Roadster, Long Range Toddy, Maximum Security, Spinoff and Gray Magician.

1355,"Henry, the ignoble noble, was a catalyst for our Bill of Rights | Ask Judge Smith","Judge Layne Smith (Photo: Judge Layne Smith)

Although he has been dead for over 471 years, King Henry VIII continues to fascinate us, and nobody likes him better than the entertainment industry. Henry’s life and reign are featured on the BBC’s series, “Wolf Hall,” Showtime’s series, “The Tudors,” and the Academy Award winning movie, “A Man for All Seasons.”

Most people remember Henry for having six wives. He was so desperate to father a male heir that he beheaded two wives and annulled marriages to two others. Ironically, it was Henry’s infertility that prevented him from having more children.

Aside from his family issues, Henry was a ruthless tyrant and a self-centered jerk. He placed himself above the law and domineered parliament and his subjects. Henry imprisoned, tortured, and killed his subjects with impunity, and without due process of law. He also got his way by bribery, patronage, and coercion.

Shown from left to right: Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn and Damian Lewis as King Henry VII in ""Wolf Hall."" (Photo: Playground & Company Pictures for MASTERPIECE/BBC)

Henry lived the high life and financed his reign by confiscating the assets of the Catholic Church and the private property of his subjects.

By “nationalizing” the assets of others without paying them any compensation, Henry served as a role-model for future communists.

Henry established a state religion, censored free speech, restricted a free press, and prevented people from peaceably assembling or petitioning his government for redress of their grievances. (Think the First Amendment).

His henchmen regularly searched people and seized private property without lawful justification. (Think the Fourth Amendment).

In addition to taking others’ property without due process of law or compensation, Henry compelled defendants to testify against themselves, and he used their silence to incriminate them. (Think the Fifth Amendment).

He eliminated some foes without making any formal charges against them. Others were denied the right to counsel and weren’t allowed to present defenses. They couldn’t confront adverse witnesses, compel favorable evidence, or have their cases decided by fair and impartial juries. (Think the Sixth Amendment).

Finally, during Henry’s reign people were caged, racked, starved, or otherwise tortured. Some were executed by being burned at the stake, boiled alive, or disemboweled. Cruelness was regularly practiced to discourage resistance. (Think the Eighth Amendment).

Our founders knew English history and they were aware of Henry, VIII’s chronic abuses of power. To protect us from like-minded tyrants, the federal government they formed divides its powers among three equal branches and employs a system of checks and balances. Henry VIII’s infamy was a catalyst for the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution.

Henry VIII was an ignoble noble. Perhaps had he been less tyrannical and better behaved, our Bill of Rights would read much differently.

1356,"6-year-old takes control of SUV, hits other car, tree","PENSACOLA — Many a young man has dreamed of the day he could get behind the wheel of a car, but 6 years old? That might be a little too young.

But that’s what happened last night at a dollar store in Pensacola, and it resulted in the arrest of a woman for child neglect.

According to a press release from the Florida Highway Patrol, the woman, Cassady N. Ellis, no age or city of residence given, parked her Dodge SUV at the Dollar Tree at 8992 Pensacola Boulevard and went inside the store, leaving a 6-year-old, 4-year-old and 3-year-old in the vehicle.

1357,Classical musicians feel pain of brutal repression in Venezuela,"MIAMI - Two years ago, Armando Cañizales' music was silenced in the streets of Caracas. It was his first time joining a protest against Nicolás Maduro. The18-year-old viola player was with other unarmed classical musicians when they decided to brave the National Guard's violence.

Witnesses said Cañizales and his friends weren't destroying property. They were taking over the street to express their disapproval of Maduro's move to reform the country's 1999 Constitution without a universal vote, which Maduro's opposition denounced as a ""coup d'état.""

The officers followed orders to clear the streets at the municipality of Baruta, in Caracas' Las Mercedes district, known for its art galleries and shopping. Behind the riot shields, officers armed with teargas grenade guns had scared away grandparents and children.

A Caraota Digital video shows Cañizales, who was wearing a helmet, throwing rocks. He was standing behind others who were holding shields made out of wood. They had stopped throwing rocks when he walked forward and stood in front of the crowd of protesters alone.

To show that he was an unarmed, he raised his arms and exposed his chest and hands while standing near the intersection of Rio de Janeiro Avenue and Jalisco Street. Seconds later, he dropped to the ground. Musician William Hernández, 19, saw him fall.

Venezuelan journalist Luis Olavarrieta said the only attackers were in front of him. Both saw other protesters pick up Cañizales and carry him away from the officers. Olavarrieta filmed when volunteers rushed him to a parked ambulance.

""Armando! No,"" a man shouted when he saw his face uncovered. Doctors later pronounced him dead May 3, 2017.

On Friday night, Venezuelans in Miami are remembering him and other victim's of Maduro's administration at a 6 p.m. concert in the Design District. Eduardo Marturet, the Venezuelan conductor of the Miami Symphony Orchestra, and Emilio Estefan are co-hosting a vigil with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez.

Cañizales started playing the viola when he was 10. He was a member of the Youth Symphony José Francisco del Castillo and had been accepted to medical school. His mother, Dr. Mónica Carrillo, a pediatrician, and his father, Israel Cañizales, an academic, were proud.

Cañizales had benefited from the musical training of the Simón Bolívar Musical Foundation, better known as ""El Sistema.""José Antonio Abreu, an economist, politician and conductor, founded it in 1975 and in 2008 said he viewed it as a way to promote ""children's sublime right to music."" Hugo Chávez praised his efforts, but as oil prices declined Maduro neglected the program. Abreu saw the decline of the classical music scene in Caracas before he died March 24, 2018.

In this Jan. 1, 2017 file photo, maestro Gustavo Dudamel conducts the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. AP FILE

Venezuelan musicians worldwide felt the pain. The program's most famous pupil, Gustavo Dudamel, a conductor and violinist, who is the director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, released a statement in response to Cañizales' murder.

""We must stop ignoring the just cry of the people suffocated by an intolerable crisis,"" Dudamel said. ""I raise my voice against violence. I raise my voice against repression.""

Wuilly Arteaga was injured days before he was arrested Thursday in Caracas.

Musicians like Wuilly Arteaga, 23, started to play his violin during protests in Cañizales' honor. Amid the harassment of Maduro's loyalists and lack of job opportunities, Arteaga and other musicians have been forced to play in the streets of cities in Colombia, Peru, Brazil, the United States and Europe.

A photograph showing Arteaga playing the violin amid tear gas was the cover of The Organization of American States' May 29, 2018 report on possible crimes against humanity in Venezuela. Cañizales' murder was case 47.

""He was shot with a round metallic projectile that entered at the base of the neck,"" the report said.

Venezuelan authorities never identified the shooter who killed Cañizales. Olavarrieta is still covering the brutal repression of the National Guard in Venezuela. The 1999 Constitution that Cañizales died defending allowed Juan Guaidó to step up as interim president Jan. 23, after the opposition demed last year's May 20 re-election of Maduro for a second six-year term illegitimate.

1359,Suzy Fleming Leonard: Empty Bowls event at Rockledge Gardens left me with a full heart,"""One of my many impulsive ideas,"" said Theresa Riley.

That's how she describes Empty Bowls, an April 28 event that raised more than $6,000 for Daily Bread, a Melbourne-based organization battling hunger and homelessness.

""I have a little sweet spot in my heart for homelessness and hunger,"" said Riley, who owns Rockledge Gardens with her husband, Kevin.

It all started with a suggestion from Ernest Wertheim, a Holocaust survivor who turns 100 this year. Wertheim has been involved in the nursery and landscape architecture business in San Francisco since the 1940s.

""He used to always respond to my emails and challenge me to do something different,"" Riley said.

When she told him about a holiday celebration she hosted in the Rockledge nursery, he replied, ""It's beautiful that you do this for your customers, but did you ever think about doing this for homeless people, or hungry people, and let them see the beauty of Christmas?""

Wertheim's challenge resonated with Riley. She began working with an organization that fed homeless people in Cocoa. Still, she wanted to do more.

During a January trip to North Carolina, she saw an Empty Bowls poster hanging in an Episcopal church. The concept of the international project is simple. Artists and businesspeople in a community join forces to raise money and awareness to fight hunger.

Buy Photo Jeff Jeff Njus of Daily Bread listens as Theresa Riley of Rockledge Gardens talks with guests at the recent Empty Bowls event. (Photo: Suzy Fleming Leonard/FLORIDA TODAY)

Riley contacted Jeff Njus, an old friend and executive director of Daily Bread.

""I said it might take me a year to pull it together,"" she said.

Daily Bread already has a big fundraiser in the fall. Njus asked if she might be able to plan the event for the spring.

Riley started with Marlyn Foell, a former art teacher at Rockledge High, and Melbourne potter Rudy Pacarro. They connected her with Mimi's Crafts, Art Abilities, Maria Torruellas, the Foosaner Art Museum and Outlaw Pottery, as well as the art programs at Eau Gallie, Melbourne and Viera high schools.

""And it just kind of spread from there,"" she said. ""It just blossomed, and really went very, very smoothly. People were then asking: 'How can we help?' ""

Ossorio Bakery & Cafe, Scott's on Fifth, Lello's Ristorante Pizzeria, Tuscany Grill, Healthy Hearts of Viera, Two Chicks and a Pot, Sunrise Bread Co., Sunkissed Bakehouse, Red Velvet Creative, Barbara's Swiss Treats, Pasta Nostra and the Daily Bread kitchen pitched in to fill bowls with soup and to put bread and dessert on the tables.

The Brevard Zoo donated compostable bowls to cut down on waste during the event.

The event sold out — 125 tickets, plus a wait list — before Riley had time to really even advertise.

Buy Photo Colorful flowers cut from the Rockledge Gardens nursery decorated tables at the Empty Bowls event. (Photo: Suzy Fleming Leonard/FLORIDA TODAY)

The night of the event was pure magic. Tables covered with multicolored cloths filled the Rockledge Gardens event pavilion. Mismatched vases, leftovers from past weddings, were filled with Brazilian sunflowers and other blossoms and greenery cut from the nursery's grounds. SaxWest provided music. Volunteers worked the crowd selling raffle tickets by the arm-length.

For a $25 ticket, each guest got a bowl and dinner. Leftover bowls sold for $20.

Four days later, Riley couldn't conceal the wonder in her voice as she talked about the evening, the way the community came together for a common purpose.

""People want to do good, and want to have opportunities to make a difference,"" she said.

She wants to make Empty Bowls an annual event for Brevard. The high schools want to be involved again, as do most of the restaurants and other artists. She hopes to increase the number of tickets next year.

Here's what Njus had to say in an email to Riley the next day:

""Something powerful happens when we come together ... and that power is called love! With contributions from the artistic community, the restaurant community and the business community, it was truly a special evening. And the warm, hospitable environment at Rockledge Gardens is something special, even spiritual. Thank you, Theresa and Kevin!""

When I left Rockledge Gardens that night, I brought home a cheerful yellow soup bowl and a warmth generated by more than good food and good company.

""Bowls are just beautiful, and symbolic,"" Riley said. ""Hopefully, people will put them in prominent places as a reminder.""

Come to think of it, this being Volusia County, you might be more likely to be hit by lightning.

But Steven Plunkett, 64, of Orange City, scratched a $20 Gold Rush Classic scratch-off game ticket and beat the odds, according to the Florida Lottery.

Plunkett chose to take his $1 million prize as a one-time payment, according to lottery spokesperson Lizeth George, netting him $710,000 (before taxes). Lil' Sammy's Food Mart at 2135 South Volusia Avenue, where he bought the winning ticket, will receive a $2,000 bonus commission.

The Gold Rush Classic game offers chances to win prizes up to $5,000,000. The game’s overall odds of winning something are one-in-2.99. The odds of winning one of the million-dollar prizes is one-in-2,016,000, and the odds of walking home with the $5 million prize is one-in-10,080,000.

1361,Man accused of shooting at teens using HOA pool,"- A member of a Homeowners Association at an Ormond Beach community was hauled off to jail, accused of firing off shots at some teenagers who were just trying to use the neighborhood pool.

The mothers of the boys are livid. One mother told FOX 35 that she’s just happy her son came home safe and alive.

“When my son said, 'We're not leaving,' actually turned away and the gun went off,” explained Darla Carlson.

She said she was mad that her son came home past curfew one night last week, until she learned he had almost been shot.

“You approached my son with a gun in your hand and you were ready for a fight. You were wrong to ever do that,” she said.

The showdown between Richard Marcelle, 66, and her 16-year-old son played out at the clubhouse pool inside The Village subdivision in Ormond Beach. Police said Carlson’s son and two other teens were at the pool around 9 p.m., when Marcelle, a member of the HOA board, tried to kick them out, saying the pool closed at 8 p.m.

The boys pointed out the sign that said it didn’t close until 10 p.m. According to the police report, Marcelle said the board voted to close the pool earlier but hadn’t changed the sign yet.

“The guy said that you are leaving and pulled out a gun.”

Police said Marcelle shot at the dirt, scaring off the kids, but not before they wrote down his license plate number.

“My son actually approached me and said he cannot get away with this,” Carlson said.

Worried her son and his friends may have started the trouble, officers told her surveillance video proved otherwise.

“They did the right thing and the footage tells it all. I cried to my mom and dad, going 'I raised him right!'”

Marcelle was charged and is now out on bond. When FOX 35 approached him Thursday afternoon, he did not want to talk.

1365,Woolly mammoth tooth found near Palm Bay pond,"PALM BAY, Fla. - A toddler stumbled upon a woolly mammoth tooth last weekend alongside a retention pond in southeast Palm Bay, uncovering evidence of the tusked beasts that roamed the Space Coast thousands of years ago.

Monte Brigance, a retired offshore electrician from Livingston, Texas, was babysitting his grandson Colt Couch, who turns 3 on Wednesday, during the unexpected discovery, according to News 6 partner Florida Today.

""He was throwing rocks into the pond. That's his favorite thing to do: throw rocks in the pond that he picks up out of the bank. About half of this was sticking out of the soil, and he couldn't pull it up,"" Brigance said, holding the mammoth tooth.

""So I pulled it up for him and got to looking at it — and I decided that we'd better not throw it away. We'll clean it up and see what it looks like,"" Brigance said.

""Out of all the places my wife and I have been, looking for fossils — and yet we come to Florida and go to a pond, and there it is sticking out of the ground. It was a nice little find,"" he said.

Though most people conjure mental images of woolly mammoths trudging across snow-swept Arctic tundra, Ice Age creatures were common in Florida, particularly along the Atlantic Coastal Ridge.

""Twenty thousand years ago, sea level was 400 feet lower than it is today. So the ocean shoreline was like 40 miles off the coast here. The Indian River was a lot like the St. Johns prairie today,"" said Bob Gross, past chairman of the Brevard County Historical Commission.

""You have these big grazing prairies. The mammoths were grazers, and the mastadons were browsers. You can see their teeth are totally different in their structure,"" Gross said.

""You can picture those prairies covered with bison, with mammoths and mastadons, giant ground sloths, camels, horses,"" he said.

Archaeologists have excavated skeletons of mammoths, mastadons and fellow Pleistocene creatures from the famed ""Melbourne bone beds."" These deposits, which lie beneath Crane Creek Reserve Golf Course and the nearby Florida Institute of Technology, extend southward to Vero Beach.

""If you go to any sand pit that gets below the surficial geology, you can pick shark's teeth, various mammal bones. You can pick mastadon and mammoth teeth and bones,"" said Gary Zarillo, Florida Tech professor of ocean engineering and marine sciences.

""The fossilized skeletons of the large megafauna that we had here up until about 10,000 years ago: large sloths, saber-toothed cats, things like that,"" he said.

Columbian mammoths appeared in Florida about 1.5 million years ago, then vanished about 10,000 years ago because of human hunting and other factors, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville.

In 1913, the Indian River Farms Co. dredged a Vero Beach canal, revealing bones of mammoth, mastadon, giant armadillo and other extinct species. Two years later, a human skull was spotted on the canal wall, Florida Today reported.

This ""Vero Man"" discovery marked the first in the New World where human remains and artifacts were found alongside Ice Age animals, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. Researchers believe the find shows people inhabited Florida as far back as 14,000 years ago or more — much earlier than previously believed.

In Melbourne, Crane Creek and its tributaries yielded similar discoveries during the 1920s. Archaeologists Frederick Loomis of Amherst College and James Gidley of the Smithsonian Institution unearthed two complete mammoth skeletons and found the crushed skull of ""Melbourne Man,"" akin to his Vero counterpart.

One skeleton was excavated at today's Botanical Gardens on the Florida Tech campus. Today, this Melbourne mammoth looms above visitors alongside skeletons of a mastadon and Irish deer at the Beneski Museum of Natural History at Amherst College in Massachusetts. What's more, the Division III school's athletic teams are nicknamed the Mammoths.

At Florida Tech, a partial mammoth molar is displayed inside a glass showcase in the University Archives Exhibition Room at Evans Library. Discovered near campus, the molar dates back more than 10,000 years.

And in Cocoa, a replica mastodon skeleton highlights the Brevard Museum of History & Natural Science in Cocoa. That beast's bones were cast from a mastadon found in the Aucilla River near Tallahassee.

Brigance and his wife, Cheri, are visiting family in Palm Bay. They have recently toured the Grand Canyon and hiked in New Mexico and Colorado. He said he initially suspected the mammoth tooth was a piece of asphalt, according to Florida Today.

“I always think it’s amazing when archaeological discoveries are made like this — especially when everyday people just kind of stumble onto items like this,” said Ben Brotemarkle, Florida Historical Society executive director.

“It’s amazing just to contemplate what it would have been like to be a human being alive at that time, when those types of huge animals were roaming around,"" Brotemarkle said.

1367,Texas man wanted in California child abduction arrested in Keys,"Deputies say Warren Demers, wanted in connection with a California child abduction, bought a sailboat in the Florida Keys and wanted to take his 8-year-old daughter to Cuba.

MARATHON, Fla. - A Texas man wanted in California for abducting his 8-year-old daughter was arrested Tuesday in the Florida Keys.

Warren Demers, 49, of New Caney, Texas, was arrested by Monroe County Sheriff's Office deputies during a traffic stop on U.S. Highway 1 in Marathon.

Sheriff's spokesman Adam Linhardt said Demers was wanted for kidnapping in San Bernardino County, California. Authorities there said Demers possibly possessed forged court documents stating he had rightful custody of the girl.

A be-on-the-lookout alert was issued for Demers, who was believed to be driving a Ford truck with a Texas license plate.

Linhardt said deputies received information Tuesday that Demers had purchased a boat in the Keys and was headed south. Deputies on the Seven Mile Bridge spotted a truck matching the description that was pulling a sailboat.

When deputies stopped the truck, they found Demers, the girl and a German shepherd inside.

""Demers and the girl had apparently been living out of the truck,"" Linhardt said. ""The truck was filthy and not suitable for living. It was learned that Demers planned on taking the girl to Cuba in the sailboat.""

The girl was turned over to the Florida Department of Children and Families, while the dog was placed in the care of the Florida Keys Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Demers was arrested and taken to jail. He is expected to be transferred to California to face charges.

Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez said officers received a call about a domestic violence incident inside the gated Caribe Lakes community on Southwest 154th Court.

Perez said police believed ""someone was potentially killing someone else."" He said the first officer to arrive had to intervene and entered the home.

""What can only be described as a horrific scene, he found a deceased person,"" Perez said.

Perez said the officer encountered a man armed with a knife and was forced to fire, killing him.

""The officer potentially saved some lives today,"" Perez said. ""Unfortunately, he had to take someone's life in the process.""

Perez said the couple's children -- a young adult and teenager -- were also inside the home.

""We believe this is a husband and wife situation,"" Perez said. ""The wife is dead on the scene as well from extreme trauma to the body.""

Perez said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the shooting, while Miami-Dade police homicide detectives will investigate the wife's death.

1370,"Wildfire season starts slow in Florida, but concern grows about Panhandle communities","CLOSE Raw video from the Allanton Road wildfire in Bay County, which burned 669 acres in March 2017. Kevin Elliott, Special to USA Today Network - Florida

There was a knock on Kevin Elliott's front door the last Saturday in March. It was his neighbor, there to tell him a fire was burning in the woods behind his house.

Six months earlier, Elliott's home in eastern Bay County survived Hurricane Michael's 150 mph winds. But the storm left 72 million tons of downed trees in its wake, the state said, and turned the woods behind Elliott's house into a tinderbox ready to erupt.

The fire behind Elliott's home was started by a neighbor burning yard trash, Florida Forest Service records show.

Normally, a fire like that would have taken a few hours to contain, said Jim Karels, director of the Florida Forest Service. But with all of the fire fuels on the ground, it took days to control and ended up burning 669 acres.

With Florida entering its peak wildfire season, fire officials are especially concerned about more fires breaking out in the areas hit hardest by the hurricane.

“Michael just ravaged the forest of the Panhandle,” Karels said. “If we have a normal fire season, with those fuels, it could be catastrophic.”

But while fire officials keep a cautious eye on Northwest Florida, for most of the rest of the state the wildfire season has arrived not with a roar but with a whimper.

Consistent rain over the winter and early spring has led to the slowest start to wildfire season in over a decade, data from the Florida Forest Service shows.

Florida firefighters battled 450 wildfires on state land through March 31, the fewest over the first three months of a year in more than a decade, according to a Naples Daily News and News-Press analysis of state wildfire data going back to 2008.

The next slowest start to the fire season was 2014, when 566 wildfires burned on state land over the first three months.

This year’s 450 fires burned 7,228 acres, the smallest number of acres burned in that period since 2015, when 622 fires burned 5,595 acres through the first three months of the year. Most of this year's fires were small, an acre or less.

The slow start to fire season is a good thing, Karels said, but it may not continue. The coming months are typically the busiest of the year for big, dangerous fires.

“This time of year is the time you don’t let your guard down,” he said.

Elliott, 44, said he is concerned about his eastern Bay County neighbors, who are already emotionally wrecked from the storm. While the March fire burned most of the fuel behind his house, there are still plenty of places at risk.

""It happened to us. It's not unlikely that it will happen again,"" he said of the wildfire. ""All of the eastern side of the county is in the same situation.""

Consistent rain has kept Florida wet

Florida hasn’t had a particularly wet winter or spring. Rainfall levels in the state have been within about 2 inches of average, said Robert Molleda with the National Weather Service in Miami.

But the rain has been consistent enough to keep the state from seeing drought-like conditions that would spark an active wildfire season.

“We haven’t had one of these years where it’s been dry with virtually no rain for three or four weeks at a time,” Molleda said. “We’ve had weather systems fairly periodic, once a week or so, that’s brought rainfall across the area.”

He warned, though, that dry conditions and higher temperatures could change the landscape before the rainy season begins. April and the first two weeks of May are among the hottest times of the year in terms of daily high temperatures.

“Even though the dry season has been not extremely dry or extremely wet, it’s usually the last month of the season that can be particularly dangerous with wildfires because the temperatures are increasing and we have a lingering dry air from the end of the dry season,” Molleda said.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is calling for above-average chances of above-average temperatures but also above-average chances of above-average rain between now and June.

This year’s quiet start to wildfire season stands in stark contrast to 2018 and 2017, which had two of the busiest starts to fire seasons of the last decade, the state data shows.

Through the first three months of 2017, firefighters battled 1,223 fires that burned 52,535 acres of state land. Last year through March, there were 1,094 fires that burned 68,302 acres of state land.

Todd Waldeck, 58, is still rebuilding after a March 2017 fire burned down his family’s home in the forest east of Naples.

Waldeck, who was unable to find a builder with the insurance money he received for his under-insured home, decided last year to rebuild the house himself. He now spends most of his days alone in the woods, laying blocks and framing walls.

“We can’t afford to do it any other way,” he said.

Man-made fires in March, lightning fires later

The biggest wildfire on state land so far in 2019 erupted in mid-January on the western bank of Lake Okeechobee.

The fire – deemed arson after investigators found several small ignition points in the same area – initially burned about 300 acres in the dried out marshes. Because it burned in a mucky area where its difficult to bring bulldozers and equipment, firefighters conducted a 1,500-acre burn out operation to consume the fuel around the fire.

“We kind of accelerate the natural burning process,” said Melissa Yunas, a Florida Forest Service wildfire mitigation specialist in the state’s Okeechobee District. “If it would have burned naturally, it would have burned for a couple of weeks and up to a month.”

There were 199 wildfires in March, the busiest month of the year so far. In fact, March often is the busiest month in terms of the total quantity of fires.

From 2008 through 2018, there were more wildfires in March – 4,808 – than in any other calendar month, according to Florida Forest Service data. Typically, those fires are man-made, caused by people burning yard debris, out of control campfires, kids playing with fire and arson, data show.

Through March, 171 of the state’s 450 wildfires were caused by debris burning, making it the leading cause of fires in the state this year, followed by 112 intentionally set incendiary fires, or arson.

In early March, firefighters had to conduct a 590-acre burnout in Osceola County, after a trash fire near the Brevard County line escaped a barrel.

A couple of weeks later, a 2-acre fire in Highlands County destroyed a travel trailer where a man was living and killed the man's dogs, Yunas said. That fire also was started by a resident burning yard waste.

“Whether it’s a small fire or a large fire, it can still be devastating,” Yunas said.

Karels said people burning trash or yard debris need to be sure they have the proper setbacks and water on hand, and should check with their fire department about any local burn bans. People who start fires, even inadvertently, could face costly fire suppression costs and could end up in court, he said.

The state’s biggest fires typically ignite in May and June, which are typically among the driest months of the year. State data show the most common cause of fires in May and June is lightning strikes, which pick up when the rainy season kicks in, but often before the landscape is sufficiently wet.

“Lightning loves to put them strikes down in the middle of nowhere,” Karels said. “It gives that fire the ability to gain strength before we can get there.”

The next few months are typically the peak of fire season, and Karels said he doesn’t expect this year to be any different.

The National Interagency Fire Center, a Idaho-based wildland firefighting support center, is calling for normal wildfire potential in Florida through June.

“I don’t think we’re going to go into any extreme drought. They’re not forecasting that at all,” Karels said. “However, with those fuels we have, we don’t need extreme drought right now.”

“It won’t take much drying, a couple two to three days, and you have the potential for fire to run again.”

Within a week of a man being found in a car on Kissimmee Street with a fatal gunshot wound, there was a desperate call to stem the rash of gun violence in Tallahassee.

Community, faith, elected and law enforcement leaders who gathered there last week wanted city residents to realize their neighborhood could be next.

“We’re standing on the corner where the last body was found. We have sympathy for the victim and his family, but it could have been anywhere. Next week it may be somewhere else,” said Jacqueline Perkins, the chairwoman of the Greater Bond Neighborhood safety and crime prevention committee at a Thursday news conference. “This is not about Bond. It just happens to be in Bond.”

Perkins pointed to a rash of gun violence in the first five months of 2019 that has seen at least 23 shootings, according to a Tallahassee Democrat analysis and map. At least 24 people have been injured and four killed in connection with those shootings, including two within a week of each other on April 21 and 28.

Details about both shootings from the Tallahassee Police Department are sparse. The names, ages and genders of the victims have not been released due to TPD’s interpretation of Marcy’s Law.

The recent spate of shootings are sobering for a city that has struggled to reduce crime in the county with the state's highest crime rate.

About 80 percent of crime countywide occurs in city limits. And while some strides have been made — self-reported figures released in May 2018 showed the county's crime rate decreased by 15 percent the year before — it remained Florida's highest for the fourth year in a row.

Crime-fighting cameras

During her decades living in the city, Perkins, 62, has seen some unwelcome changes. She said the problems can't be solved simply through more policing.

“That is unbelievable that in this town called Tallahassee, that used to be a little sleepy town, we’ve got people who are just killing each other,” she said at the corner of Kissimmee and Keith streets.

“We’ve got to deal with the deep-seeded problems that we have in our young people in our communities and our families to see why people are just deciding that they’re going to take somebody’s life with no concern.”

Law enforcement officials and residents in the Bond Community have been making a concerted effort to work together to help improve safety in the neighborhood. The community welcomed surveillance cameras at six strategic locations in 2017 that have, in conjunction with more interaction by Tallahassee Police, driven crime down by 30 percent. There is a push to install more.

Chris Daniels moved from Cincinnati to the neighborhood in 2004. He’s noticed the difference the cameras have made in deterring crime in identified hot spots. But he’s also noticed those selling drugs and engaging in prostitution have just moved out of their view.

“Where they put the cameras at people have gone away from those areas, so you don’t see as much crazy activity there,” he said. “It’s going to be a continuous effort, but it has helped.”

More residents are taking charge and targeting people who dump trash and come to Bond only to cause problems, tarnishing the reputation of the centrally located neighborhood close to both of Tallahassee’s universities, the St. Marks Trail and downtown

“Violence is a drawback from the community so people don’t want live here. They’re afraid because they think it’s a violent area,” Daniels said. “What a lot of people don’t realize is a lot of stuff that happens here is not people that live here.”

Community leaders call for action

Thursday's gathering wasn't the first time in recent years elected officials and local leaders, galvanized by an eruption of violence, have pleaded with the public for help stopping the bloodshed.

The renewed push may signal an effort to bring awareness to the issue before summer, which historically brings an increase in shootings.

Mayor John Dailey said it was time to “double down” on efforts. Assistant City Manager over public safety Cynthia Barber, said it was time to do more than just talk.

“It’s a time to call for action,"" she said. ""What are we collectively going to do about what’s happening to young people in our community?”

City Commissioner Curtis Richardson noted past efforts, including the hiring of more officers, body-worn cameras and a push to recruit.

“This has been an issue that we have made a top priority of the City Commission,” Richardson said. “We have not only talked about it, but we have put our finances where our mouths are. We have given the chief and the police department the resources they need.""

But he too warned more officers is not always the answer.

“We can’t police our way out of this,” he said. “One crime is too many. We won’t rest until all crime is eliminated in our community. Particularly the unnecessary, unwarranted violent crime that has been happening in our community, especially among our young people.”

Pastor Rudy Ferguson called the current climate of crime in Tallahassee a “state of emergency.”

Police generally show up after 911 has been called, said Tallahassee Urban league President Curtis Taylor. The time has come for citizens across the city to get off the sidelines and make a difference in their neighborhoods.

“We can’t have surveillance cameras on every street. Police can’t be everywhere at once, but you’re the citizens. You’re on every street,” Taylor said.

“Even though we’re having this press conference in Bond, this is for the whole community. North side, east side, west side, Frenchtown; wherever crime is, we’ve got to put a stop to it. Enough is enough.”

1382,Schools scrutinizing students in wake of admissions scandal,"- The recent college admissions scandal proves cheating is big business. Now, schools are cracking down and watching students’ work closer than ever before.

The headlines splashed across the country. The college cheating scandal had everything: celebrities, money, bribes. But it’s not just a problem facing the rich and famous.

“The problem is much worse because it's so easy,” said Ted Gournelos, who teaches communications at Rollins College.

We asked him to look at a paper that we purchased online.

“Oh man. This is a grad student, maybe a faculty member. Oh my God, yeah.”

It was written in just two days. The price tag was $120.

“It's written well enough that it might be even something that could be submitted for publication,” said Gournelos, but he added, “this might be plagiarized.”

The cheating scandal is heightening awareness at colleges nationwide.

“I think the temptations are there more for the students so what we try to do is be proactive,” said Rollins Honor Council supervisor Gabriel Barreneche.

Barreneche says the council investigates between 40 and 60 cases of cheating each year, and 80 percent to 90 percent of them are legitimate.

“It’s human nature, right? Someone's trying to monetize a need, and students in desperation will look for the shortcut.”

The school, like many others, asks students to commit to an academic code. They also use a website called “Turn It In,” where they scan suspicious papers for plagiarism.

“And then I'll go and use 'Turn It In' which will actually analyze line by line.”

It compares it to other web sites, papers and publications across the Internet. It puts up a red if it’s word-for-word the same as what’s on another site.

“Many faculty have it done immediately so when they turn it in, it just scans it.”

That’s something Ted Gournelos said he would definitely do with our paper, because it’s simply too good.

“This isn't just a red flag, this is a giant red neon sign saying this is plagiarized.”

Gournelos said the recent cheating scandal should rattle everyone.

“It's a wake-up call about education. Maybe we're just not teaching students right.”

A lesson for students and parents that some is watching your every move and every word.

“Parents, you should have those heart-to-hearts with your students about what it means to be a person of integrity, a person of honesty.”",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/schools-scrutinizing-students-in-wake-of-admissions-scandal,2019-05-03T22:14:13Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Florida Man,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
1383,Accused Clearwater carjacker taken into custody after stealing FHP car,"Accused Clearwater carjacker taken into custody after stealing FHP car Video

CLEARWATER, Fla. (WFLA) - The man accused in a violent carjacking at a Home Depot in Clearwater has been taken into custody after troopers say he stole an FHP cruiser in Okeechobee County.

Police say 22-year-old Shane Jensen used a stolen hammer to try and carjack a truck in the contractor loading area of the Gulf-To-Bay Home Depot on Wednesday morning. He's also accused of threatening two men with the hammer.

When that didn't work, police say Jensen threatened a 17-year-old passenger in another truck and, this time, managed to steal it. Detectives tell us Jensen sped away in the silver 2007 Dodge pickup truck, seen on security cameras and elsewhere.

Around 4 p.m. Thursday, an FHP trooper in Okeechobee County stopped for a pedestrian, later identified as Jensen, who appeared to be medically distressed along the Florida Turnpike. Troopers say Jensen was incoherent, so they called for a medical evaluation.

A road ranger then stopped behind the FHP cruiser on the side of the turnpike. When the trooper walked back to the road ranger to get water for Jensen, authorities say the 22-year-old got into the trooper's patrol car and took off.

When FHP stopped Jensen, they say he reversed the stolen cruiser and accelerated toward three troopers in an attempt to run them over. He then drove away from the traffic stop and drove into Osceola County, an FHP spokesman says.

The Osceola Sheriff's Office deployed stop sticks but troopers say Jensen avoided them and drove onto the grass median. He then got out of the cruiser and ran into the woods.

Troopers say they caught Jensen and took him to a nearby hospital for treatment. He was arrested and charged with stealing the patrol car and reckless driving. Additional charges are pending.

Shortly after he was taken into custody, Clearwater police announced they found the truck that was stolen from Home Depot.

Jensen was already charged with a number of crimes, including battery on a law enforcement officer. Detectives say those charges stem from an incident that happened at his job Monday.

According to police, Jensen broke the windows of a car belonging to his supervisor. He bonded out of jail on Tuesday, just one day before the carjacking at Home Depot.

Jensen previously worked as a lifeguard as needed at Clearwater's Long Center on North Belcher.

A Leesburg man who took law enforcement officials on a high speed chase was, according to a Florida Highway Patrol trooper, using the FaceTime app during parts of the pursuit.

Trooper A.D. Schmidt tried to stop a Ford Lincoln Town Car at 10:13 p.m. Wednesday for reckless speeding on Interstate 75 but the driver would not stop. The trooper gave chase, during which speeds varied from 90 mph to 110 mph. The trooper said the driver was using the app, which allows people to see each other during a conversation, while he was driving.

At mile marker 370, two miles north of the Orange Lake/Irvine exit, stop sticks placed by a Marion County Sheriff's Office deputy, along with a precision immobilization technique, or PIT maneuver, by the trooper, brought the Ford to a halt. The trooper removed the driver, Robert Antonio Hughes, 33, and arrested him.

The officials found marijuana in the car, the FHP report states.

A toddler stumbled upon a woolly mammoth tooth last weekend alongside a retention pond in southeast Palm Bay, uncovering evidence of the tusked beasts that roamed the Space Coast thousands of years ago.

""He was throwing rocks into the pond. That's his favorite thing to do: throw rocks in the pond that he picks up out of the bank. About half of this was sticking out of the soil, and he couldn't pull it up,"" Brigance said, holding the mammoth tooth.

""So I pulled it up for him and got to looking at it — and I decided that we'd better not throw it away. We'll clean it up and see what it looks like,"" Brigance said.

""Out of all the places my wife and I have been, looking for fossils — and yet we come to Florida and go to a pond, and there it is sticking out of the ground. It was a nice little find,"" he said.

During the Pleistocene epoch, woolly mammoth roamed the area now known as Kettle Moraine in southeastern Wisconsin. Illustration courtesy Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resources.

Though most people conjure mental images of woolly mammoths trudging across snow-swept Arctic tundra, Ice Age creatures were common in Florida, particularly along the Atlantic Coastal Ridge.

""Twenty thousand years ago, sea level was 400 feet lower than it is today. So the ocean shoreline was like 40 miles off the coast here. The Indian River was a lot like the St. Johns prairie today,"" said Bob Gross, past chairman of the Brevard County Historical Commission.

""You have these big grazing prairies. The mammoths were grazers, and the mastadons were browsers. You can see their teeth are totally different in their structure,"" Gross said.

""You can picture those prairies covered with bison, with mammoths and mastadons, giant ground sloths, camels, horses,"" he said.

Archaeologists have excavated skeletons of mammoths, mastadons and fellow Pleistocene creatures from the famed ""Melbourne bone beds."" These deposits, which lie beneath Crane Creek Reserve Golf Course and the nearby Florida Institute of Technology, extend southward to Vero Beach.

""If you go to any sand pit that gets below the surficial geology, you can pick shark's teeth, various mammal bones. You can pick mastadon and mammoth teeth and bones,"" said Gary Zarillo, Florida Tech professor of ocean engineering and marine sciences.

""The fossilized skeletons of the large megafauna that we had here up until about 10,000 years ago: large sloths, saber-toothed cats, things like that,"" he said.

Columbian mammoths appeared in Florida about 1.5 million years ago, then vanished about 10,000 years ago because of human hunting and other factors, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville.

In 1913, the Indian River Farms Co. dredged a Vero Beach canal, revealing bones of mammoth, mastadon, giant armadillo and other extinct species. Two years later, a human skull was spotted on the canal wall.

This ""Vero Man"" discovery marked the first in the New World where human remains and artifacts were found alongside Ice Age animals, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. Researchers believe the find shows people inhabited Florida as far back as 14,000 years ago or more — much earlier than previously believed.

In Melbourne, Crane Creek and its tributaries yielded similar discoveries during the 1920s. Archaeologists Frederick Loomis of Amherst College and James Gidley of the Smithsonian Institution unearthed two complete mammoth skeletons and found the crushed skull of ""Melbourne Man,"" akin to his Vero counterpart.

One skeleton was excavated at today's Botanical Gardens on the Florida Tech campus. Today, this Melbourne mammoth looms above visitors alongside skeletons of a mastadon and Irish deer at the Beneski Museum of Natural History at Amherst College in Massachusetts. What's more, the Division III school's athletic teams are nicknamed the Mammoths.

At Florida Tech, a partial mammoth molar is displayed inside a glass showcase in the University Archives Exhibition Room at Evans Library. Discovered near campus, the molar dates back more than 10,000 years.

And in Cocoa, a replica mastodon skeleton highlights the Brevard Museum of History & Natural Science in Cocoa. That beast's bones were cast from a mastadon found in the Aucilla River near Tallahassee.

Brigance and his wife, Cheri, are visiting family in Palm Bay. They have recently toured the Grand Canyon and hiked in New Mexico and Colorado. He said he initially suspected the mammoth tooth was a piece of asphalt.

“I always think it’s amazing when archaeological discoveries are made like this — especially when everyday people just kind of stumble onto items like this,” said Ben Brotemarkle, Florida Historical Society executive director.

“It’s amazing just to contemplate what it would have been like to be a human being alive at that time, when those types of huge animals were roaming around,"" Brotemarkle said.

""Out of all the places my wife and I have been, looking for fossils — and yet we come to Florida and go to a pond, and there it is sticking out of the ground. It was a nice little find,"" he said.

Though most people conjure mental images of woolly mammoths trudging across snow-swept Arctic tundra, Ice Age creatures were common in Florida, particularly along the Atlantic Coastal Ridge.

""Twenty thousand years ago, sea level was 400 feet lower than it is today. So the ocean shoreline was like 40 miles off the coast here. The Indian River was a lot like the St. Johns prairie today,"" said Bob Gross, past chairman of the Brevard County Historical Commission.

""You have these big grazing prairies. The mammoths were grazers, and the mastadons were browsers. You can see their teeth are totally different in their structure,"" Gross said.

""You can picture those prairies covered with bison, with mammoths and mastadons, giant ground sloths, camels, horses,"" he said.

Archaeologists have excavated skeletons of mammoths, mastadons and fellow Pleistocene creatures from the famed ""Melbourne bone beds."" These deposits, which lie beneath Crane Creek Reserve Golf Course and the nearby Florida Institute of Technology, extend southward to Vero Beach.

""If you go to any sand pit that gets below the surficial geology, you can pick shark's teeth, various mammal bones. You can pick mastadon and mammoth teeth and bones,"" said Gary Zarillo, Florida Tech professor of ocean engineering and marine sciences.

""The fossilized skeletons of the large megafauna that we had here up until about 10,000 years ago: large sloths, saber-toothed cats, things like that,"" he said.

Brevard animals: Whopping wild hog weighing 350 pounds captured off Sarno Road in Melbourne

Brevard animals: Bee crisis: Pollinators endure countless threats in Florida. And we need them to live

Columbian mammoths appeared in Florida about 1.5 million years ago, then vanished about 10,000 years ago because of human hunting and other factors, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville.

In 1913, the Indian River Farms Co. dredged a Vero Beach canal, revealing bones of mammoth, mastadon, giant armadillo and other extinct species. Two years later, a human skull was spotted on the canal wall.

This ""Vero Man"" discovery marked the first in the New World where human remains and artifacts were found alongside Ice Age animals, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. Researchers believe the find shows people inhabited Florida as far back as 14,000 years ago or more — much earlier than previously believed.

In Melbourne, Crane Creek and its tributaries yielded similar discoveries during the 1920s. Archaeologists Frederick Loomis of Amherst College and James Gidley of the Smithsonian Institution unearthed two complete mammoth skeletons and found the crushed skull of ""Melbourne Man,"" akin to his Vero counterpart.

One skeleton was excavated at today's Botanical Gardens on the Florida Tech campus. Today, this Melbourne mammoth looms above visitors alongside skeletons of a mastadon and Irish deer at the Beneski Museum of Natural History at Amherst College in Massachusetts. What's more, the Division III school's athletic teams are nicknamed the Mammoths.

At Florida Tech, a partial mammoth molar is displayed inside a glass showcase in the University Archives Exhibition Room at Evans Library. Discovered near campus, the molar dates back more than 10,000 years.

And in Cocoa, a replica mastodon skeleton highlights the Brevard Museum of History & Natural Science in Cocoa. That beast's bones were cast from a mastadon found in the Aucilla River near Tallahassee.

Brigance and his wife, Cheri, are visiting family in Palm Bay. They have recently toured the Grand Canyon and hiked in New Mexico and Colorado. He said he initially suspected the mammoth tooth was a piece of asphalt.

“I always think it’s amazing when archaeological discoveries are made like this — especially when everyday people just kind of stumble onto items like this,” said Ben Brotemarkle, Florida Historical Society executive director.

“It’s amazing just to contemplate what it would have been like to be a human being alive at that time, when those types of huge animals were roaming around,"" Brotemarkle said.

1395,"Police: Florida man smiles in mugshot after chase on motorcycle, fighting K-9","MELBOURNE, Fla. - A Florida man who was arrested after shooting at a house, leading authorities on a chase and fighting a K-9 sported a toothy grin in his mugshot, according to the Melbourne Police Department.

The incident began around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday when someone reported that a motorcyclist had fired shots at a residence on Buick Avenue then fled the area, the report said.

Police said they saw Philip Spurlock, 23, speeding out of the area so they followed him at a safe distance.

Video from the Brevard County Sheriff's Office helicopter unit shows Spurlock driving in the area at speeds near 100 mph. Patrol units on the ground did not pursue Spurlock.

""He knows the helicopter's over him so let's just back off him and give him some room and see if he parks somewhere. There's no way we're gonna catch him and we have no option to stop him so let's give him as much room as we need to give him and let's see if he'll stop,"" a law enforcement officer says in the video.

At about 11:40 p.m., video shows Spurlock riding his motorcycle through the front yard of a home on Lillian Drive then hopping off the bike and running through the residential area.

Authorities said Spurlock jumped several fences before opting to hide behind an air conditioning unit. Officers surrounded him there and sicced K-9 Brutus on him, according to the affidavit.

Spurlock grabbed the dog by the neck and fought with it as an officer yelled, ""Let go of the dog,"" and ""Show me your hands,"" the report said.

Spurlock was arrested on charges of causing harm to a police animal, resisting arrest without violence and two counts of shooting a missile into a dwelling.

GAINESVILLE — When a Florida woman heard a noise and saw a man trying to break into her car early Sunday, she took matters into her own hands.

Clarese Gainey, 65, of Gainesville tells WGFL that she picked up her softball bat early Sunday, braced herself and eased open the door before hitting Antonio Mosley.

Mosely ran to a nearby mobile home park, leaving behind his pants, shirt, and a sock, police said. A K-9 unit tracked him down, and Gainey said she easily identified him because of the knot on his head.

1414,"Husband kills wife, then himself in what family calls 'mercy shooting'","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The sister of a man who killed his wife and then himself in a San Souci home Wednesday night said he did it because he couldn't stand to see his wife suffer any longer.

Officers found the couple dead in their home on Goltare Drive about 3:30 p.m. when a man called 911 to report that he had shot his wife and was prepared to take his own life.

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office won't identify the victims, but family members said John and Gwendolyn Thombleson died in the home. The husband's sister said after the wife had surgery eight months ago, her health began declining rapidly and she developed several health conditions, including dementia.

The medical bills were piling up, and neighbors told News4Jax that John Thombleson had said their insurance was expiring, leaving them no way to pay for the mounting expenses.

According to police, officers sent to the home made numerous attempts to contact the people inside but the attempts were unsuccessful.

Eventually, members of the SWAT team entered the home, finding the man and woman in a bedroom.

The couple were high school sweethearts and had been married 47 years. John Thombleson was retired and Gwendolyn Thombleson worked for the school district.

This was not a domestic dispute, according to the family. They said they tried to help as much as they could during the time when the wife's health was deteriorating.

Family members called this a mercy killing and said that John Thombleson was motivated by his love for his wife.

The neighbor who lives across the street said the last time he spoke with John Thombleson, the conversation was about the couple potentially losing their home because of their mounting medical bills.

Drazen Klacer, another neighbor, said he never noticed any red flags.

“He was nice guy, older guy, ready to retire,"" Klacer said.

Lisa Veres, a third neighbor, was shocked to hear about what happened.

""You don’t hear of anything like this happening in this neighborhood,"" Veres said. ""We’ve lived here for so long and my husband’s family has lived here for so long, and everybody is just so quiet and so sweet.""

The family is planning the funeral arrangements.

Orange County Sheriff John Mina said deputies were called to the home early Wednesday because loud music was coming from a home on Majestic Oak Drive.

Mina said a 49-year-old man, whose name has not been released, pointed a gun at deputies, who opened fire, striking him. The man was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center in critical condition.

The deputies were not hurt, Mina said.

A woman was in the home but did not witness the shooting, nor was she injured, according to Mina.

Mina said deputies were called to the same home twice in March because of loud music and a man who was drunk. Mina said the man was beligerent toward deputies during at least one of those calls.

The deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in law enforcement shootings.

Mina said his agency and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the shooting.

In a tweet, the Orange County Sheriff's Office asked people to avoid the area.

1421,Video shows Florida officer punch teen near Parkland,"""What are you doing?"" a girl shouted. ""He's bleeding!""

It was Thursday at a suburban town plaza in Tamarac, Florida, about 6 miles and 14 months removed from the high school massacre in Parkland. A group of teenagers gathered where kids were known to have caused disturbances in the past. A Broward County sheriff's deputy, a member of the force criticized for its response to the Parkland attack, saw one teenager who had previously trespassed, according to arrest records.

That teen's phone bounced onto the pavement. A 15-year old went to pick it up and, in a widely circulated video from a bystander, he did so in front of a pepper-spray-wielding deputy. The deputy triggered the spray at the teen's face, and the deputy threw him to the ground.

Another deputy, Christopher Krickovich, straddled him, smashed his forehead into the asphalt several times and punched him in the head. The teen extended his arms.

""What are you doing?"" a girl shouted. ""He's bleeding!""

The arrest and charges against the teenager, coupled with the video, led to criticism and prompted an investigation. But they have also posed a difficult question for a community concerned by what many thought was a passive police response to violence: Is this the inevitable result of public demand?

The Broward County Sheriff's Office began more physical and aggressive training after a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year - implemented by the new Broward County sheriff, Gregory Tony, who was appointed in January.

The training led to violent altercations, some in the office believe, resulting in fractured bones, a detached retina and, in March, bleeding in the brain, said Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff's Office Deputies Association.

""It's almost like a 'Fight Club' atmosphere,"" Bell told The Washington Post.

Bell said full-contact takedown training has become a priority, despite concerns over injuries. The new policy is a direct result of the Parkland response's perceived shortcomings. And because of that guideline, Bell said, the deputies acted accordingly in Tamarac.

""People want accountability in Broward County,"" Bell said. ""But what the community screams for, and what they want, are two different things.""

Broward County Mayor Mark Bogen disagrees. He called for Krickovich to be fired for the ""outrageous and unacceptable"" altercation. Tony launched an investigation, saying in a video statement that he was appointed to bring accountability to the force.

""That accountability will be held not just for the sake of when we are right but in cases when we may be wrong,"" he said.

David Klinger, a criminal justice professor at University of Missouri, St. Louis, said Bell's defense obscures the occasional need to evaluate how use of force policies take shape in reality.

""Oftentimes training doesn't get to the philosophical root to explain to officers why you need to do X, Y or Z,"" Klinger said. ""Rather, it's just 'do X, Y or Z.' It's very easy for officers to misapply.""

Klinger added: ""If there is a problem with the particular use of force, and (deputies) were doing what they were trained to do and told to do, you can't criticize them. You have to see where it broke down in the chain.""

Occasionally, policing doctrine in response to one crime can lead to other infractions, Klinger said.

Thursday's altercation with officers and an unarmed teen reminded Klinger of the police killing of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old who was fatally shot in 2014 after police responded to a call of a young man pointing a gun at people. Tamir had a toy gun and was killed by police.

Later, the officer said he responded to the call as an active-shooter scenario, even though no shots were fired. That training with contextualizing threats, Klinger said, may have contributed to the killing. ""We have to figure out to teach officers how to identify and define things in a very accurate fashion,"" he said.

Bell, the association president, said the teenager in Thursday's altercation was chased and thrown to the ground after being pepper sprayed to keep him from hurting himself - like being hit by a car, for instance.

An attorney for the teenager, Richard Della Fera, criticized those comments.

""I'm so relieved to hear they're very concerned for my client's safety,"" he said, with sarcasm.

Della Fera said he will meet with the state attorney's office to discuss the behavior of the deputies and pending charges of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest without violence and trespassing.

The attorney argues that charging documents that described a tense mob of 200 students was overstated; smartphone video recorded the scene. In the video, about 15 or so students appear to be near the deputies.

Della Fera also disputed the idea that his client, whom he declined to name, had a fighting stance when he stood next to the deputy. The teen's arms appear to be at his sides in the video. The J.P. Taravella High School sophomore suffered a broken nose and may have other injuries, Della Fera said.

Della Fera conceded that it was a ""chaotic situation"" at the end.

""But police should be the calmest people in the situation,"" he said.

BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. - A 67-year-old Melbourne man is accused of damaging cars by pouring an unknown substance on them, according to an arrest report from the Brevard County Sheriff's Office.

Howard Nitta was charged with criminal mischief.

The incident happened in the 8400 block of Illinois Avenue around 1:25 a.m. on April 8.

The arrest report shows the substance caused thousands of dollars' worth of damage to multiple cars.

The victims were able to identify Nitta through surveillance video.

The victims said they have been neighbors with him for about 16 years and used to be close friends with him.

Nitta denied any involvement in the incident, according to the arrest report.

1424,Florida man who tossed daughter off bridge found guilty of murder,"CLEARWATER, Fla. - A Florida jury has found a man guilty of first-degree murder for dropping his 5-year-old daughter off a Tampa Bay area bridge four years ago.

Jurors in Clearwater deliberated for about seven hours over two days before convicting 29-year-old John Jonchuck.

[PREVIOUS: Jurors weigh case of dad accused of tossing girl off Florida bridge | Florida man who dropped daughter off bridge claims insanity]

No one disputed that Jonchuck dropped his daughter Phoebe 62 feet into Tampa Bay in January 2015.

But prosecutors claimed Jonchuck's action was premeditated and that he acted out of anger against Phoebe's mother and his own mother. They said he knew what he was doing was wrong.

His defense attorney said during closing arguments that Jonchuck was insane, and delusions led him to believe Phoebe was possessed.

1431,Tennessee murder suspect may have been in Jacksonville for months,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A man wanted on a charge of first-degree murder by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation appeared to have been living in Jacksonville since January, according to federal marshals.

But earlier this week, U.S. marshals got confirmation that Kameron Leslie was in the area and alerted police in Chattanooga, where Leslie is accused of killing Taja Whiteside inside her home in January. That alert caused the TBI to place him at the top of its ""Most Wanted"" list. And it paid off, because Leslie, 30, was arrested about 24 hours later.

Marshals told News4Jax that they captured Leslie Wednesday night at a gas station on Jacksonville's Westside.

RELATED: One of Tennessee's 'Most Wanted' captured in Jacksonville

Leslie was booked into the Duval County jail later that evening, online jail records show. He has waived his first appearance before a Duval County judge. He is being held on a fugitive warrant for extradition and is expected to be returned to Tennessee to face the murder charge.

""I just kept saying, 'Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus,'"" Sharon Claridy, Whiteside's mother, told News4Jax by phone Thursday.

Leslie is accused of strangling Whiteside, 30, in her Chattanooga home Jan. 11. The two had a relationship but were not married.

Whiteside's three children -- ages 5, 7 and 13 -- were in the home when she was killed and didn't witness her killing, the Chattanooga Police Department said. But her eldest child found her body on the floor of her bedroom.

After Whiteside's death, according to Chattanooga police, Leslie went on the run and into hiding. Almost four months later, he was taken into custody at the Westside gas station on 103rd Street, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said.

""We got a call from the detective from Chattanooga last night saying that he was in custody,"" Claridy said. ""I was very pleased.""

Chattanooga police said they never found Whiteside’s car, which they said they believe was taken by Leslie after she was killed. But when marshals took him into custody Wednesday night, they said he was on foot.

Her car has yet to be found.

1432,"DNA connects suspected Volusia serial rapist to 2 more cases, police say","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - A Volusia County man suspected in a series of rapes in the area since 2010 was charged Thursday in connection with two additional sexual battery attacks, according to Daytona Beach police.

According to Daytona Beach and Holly Hill police, Markeith Martin, 44, is suspected in seven attacks from 2010 to 2018. Martin often made his victims call him ""New York,"" according to the police reports.

Charges were filed Thursday in connection with rapes that occurred in Daytona Beach in July 2017 and July 2018.

On July 27, 2017, the victim said she met Martin and another woman at a 7-Eleven on South Ridgewood Avenue and went back with them to their hotel room where they smoked some marijuana, according to the police report.

When the other woman left the room, Martin took off his clothes and told the victim to do the same. When she said no, he stripped her clothes off and raped her, according to the report. When she attempted to leave, she said, Martin grabbed her by the throat and choked her.

Police said Martin later denied the allegations because he “never offers anyone marijuana.”

The victim told police she was able to leave when she told Martin she would go out and “mail him money.” She left and called police when she went home, according to the report.

A rape kit was completed at Halifax Medical Hospital and evidence was sent to the FDLE lab. The FDLE completed a lab report in September 2017, and investigators said they found a match for Martin's DNA from another rape in August 2017.

In the July 2018 case, authorities said the victim was walking on Beach Street around 8 p.m. when Martin approached her, brandished a pocket knife and said, ""If you leave my side, I'll kill you, (expletive).""

He dragged her into a wooded area, choked her, punched her and repeatedly raped her while forcing her to tell him that she loved him and threatening to kill her for screaming, according to the report.

After the assault, authorities said Martin forced the woman to a hotel room where he raped her again. She escaped to call 911 when he fell asleep, the report said.

Martin was in custody for another sexual battery case in which he was accused of raping a woman who's bicyclwhen investigators used DNA to link him to the July 2017 and July 2018 cases. Martin remains in the Volusia County Jail held without bail.

1433,Former Estero High School band director indicted on federal child porn charges,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Lee County on news-press.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

The former band director at Estero High School is facing federal charges after investigators said he had child pornography.

According to federal documents filed in April, Warren A. Baxter possessed child porn in July 2018.

The indictment, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, said law enforcement seized an Acer computer, a hard drive and a Samsung cell phone, all of which contained the material.

The Lee County School District began investigating Baxter at the end of the 2018 school year when a student accused him of making inappropriate comments, said district spokesman Rob Spicker.

The district gave its information to the Lee County Sheriff's Office, and detectives uncovered the pornography, Spicker said.

Baxter had a hearing with the school district's human resources department, and he resigned in July 2018.

Baxter's bond was set at $100,000. He pleaded not guilty at an April 12 arraignment and will appear before Judge John E. Steele on May 13.

A trial is scheduled for Baxter June 3 in Fort Myers, though that date could be pushed back. If found guilty, he could face time in federal prison.

Attorneys with the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida and Baxter's defense attorney declined to comment.

1434,28-year-old man suffered stroke after cracking his neck,"(CNN) - A 28-year-old father of two is recovering in Oklahoma after suffering a stroke caused by popping his neck.

“The moment I heard the pop, everything on my left side started to go numb,” Josh Hader told KOCO 5. “I got up and tried to get an ice pack from the fridge, and I remember I couldn't walk straight.”

Hader's father-in-law rushed him to the emergency room.

“I had about six or seven nurses and doctors surrounding me,” Hader said.

Hader tore his vertebral artery, a crucial vessel leading to the brain.

“He could have formed more clot on that tear and had a life-ending stroke. He could have died,” said Dr. Vance McCollom, at Mercy Hospital.

“If you have a stroke in that area, you can end up with a patient (who's) locked in,” McCollom added. “They completely understand what's going on, but they can't communicate. They can't move anything. They can't speak. They can't breathe.”

Although Hader's stroke wasn't significant, it did cause a lot of damage. He had to wear an eyepatch and use a walker for several days.

“For the first few days, I couldn't walk without a walker,” Hader said. “It is difficult to walk with my left leg.""

Hader said he also had painful hiccups that nearly caused a panic attack. But the most difficult part has been not being able to help his wife with their two young children.

“I can't pick him up out of the crib, give him milk in the middle of the night. I can't do any of that,” Hader said.

“If you want to pop your neck, just kind of pop it side to side. Don't twist it,” McCollom said. “Whenever you twist it, there's a risk of tearing that vessel. Say my hand is his head, I suspect he just turned it real sharp and up, sharp and up and back. That's what really pinched it.”",http://www.wfla.com/national/28-year-old-man-suffered-stroke-after-cracking-his-neck/1972740224,2019-05-02T10:51:51Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1435,Estero man's alleged threats at Bonita Springs plaza dentist's office come back to bite him,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Lee County on news-press.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

An Estero man’s threatening behavior at a Bonita Springs dentist's office came back to bite him Tuesday.

Christopher Lynn King, 28, is in Lee County Jail on two aggravated assault charges after workers and patients at a dentist’s office said he partially disrobed after demanding a loose crown be fixed immediately and threatened them with a gun as he left the parking lot.

A Lee County Sheriff’s Office report said workers at the dentist office told deputies that King was walking around the office and into non-patient areas being loud and demanding attention before being taken into a treatment room. King had been at the practice earlier to have a temporary crown placed that had since come loose.

Staff members said they heard King say that if his crown wasn’t fixed immediately he would do what he did at a previous doctor’s office. A staff member at the practice told deputies she knew he was referring to getting a weapon and returning to the office.

Another staff member told deputies that King warned her that she didn’t know what he was capable of.

The report said King took off his shirt as he left the office around 4:40 p.m. after a staff member told him the repair would take 15 minutes. King told the staff member he would go to his car and speed up the process and then sat in his car in the parking lot for five minutes.

Workers at the practice locked the office doors and ran to the rear of the business after King left.

Witnesses in the report said King then slowly drove from the lot pointing a gun at the office as he left.

Sheriff’s Office deputies went to a home in Estero where King was staying and spoke with the homeowner who told them that he allows King to stay there and provided him with $1,000 for dental work.

The homeowner told deputies he met King during a Prison Pen Pals Association meeting and has let King stay at his home for about a year and also had let King stay with him at a home in Bonita Springs.

A search of the car King was driving turned up no weapons, the report said. A black flashlight was found and detectives said it could have been used to imitate a weapon.

King served two prison sentences in Florida, both for aggravated assaults; a year term in 2013 for a Pasco County incident and a 7-month sentence in 2018 for a similar crime in Collier County.

He has multiple arrests in Lee County for battery, marijuana possession and a traffic violation and has a Collier County arrest for contempt of court, aggravated assault and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

King remains behind bars on $100,000 bond and will be arraigned June 3.

1436,Man still on road to recovery nearly a year after being injured by boat propellers,"<p>For the first time since a horrific freak accident on the water, a young father is speaking to Local 10 News about the day a stranger saved his life and his life was changed forever.</p>

<p>""I remember looking at my wife and I was basically saying 'bye' to her. I knew I was going to die,"" Jonathan Cruz said. </p>

<p>Cruz spent Father's Day last year boating off Elliot Key with his wife and two children when a fellow boater who was stuck on a sandbar asked for help. Cruz and his cousin went to their aid.</p>

<p>""I was walking toward the back of the boat and then it turned on. (It's) literally how you see in the movies when you get sucked into something -- that's how I felt,"" Cruz said.</p>

<p>Authorities said someone, reportedly a child, accidentally turned the key in the ignition. </p>

<p>Cruz was right by the propellers.</p>

<p>His pelvis was shredded and he started bleeding profusely immediately.</p>

<p>Cruz said he went numb and started to drift away.</p>

<p>""I was going out and she was telling me, 'Your kids and your wife need you. Stay up,'"" Cruz said.</p>

<p>Cruz believes he would not be here today if not for an off-duty Miami-Dade firefighter who happened to be on a boat nearby.</p>

<p>""What are the odds of that, that a firefighter is out there with an IV?"" Cruz said, </p>

<p>""The fact that he gave him the fighting chance to get to the hospital is insane,"" Cruz's wife, Jessica Cruz, said.  </p>

<p>Miami-Dade firefighter Terrance Dolan kept Cruz stable until he could be airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center. </p>

<p>Cruz was in a coma for two weeks. Doctors weren't sure he was going to live for three months and said he will never be the same.</p>

<p>""A lot more surgeries and they're still trying to reconstruct my rectum because the propellers took my rectum,"" Cruz said.</p>

<p>Cruz is also still fighting to save his right leg.</p>

<p>His wife, who he met in ninth grade and married eight years ago, is his aide, his nurse and his sunshine. Together they have 4-year-old twins and so much to live for.</p>

<p>""We are really blessed because he was given that fighting chance. Not everyone is given that fighting chance,"" Jessica Cruz said. </p>

<p>Jonathan Cruz said he wants others to remember his plight and always be safe on the water.</p>

<p>""If you are out on the sandbar and you are not going anywhere for a while, take the keys out of the ignition,"" he said. ""You can have fun. Be smart out there.""</p>

1437,Firestone tech takes man's car for joyride,"ORANGE PARK, Fla, - Imagine taking your car in for service, then finding out that a worker took it for a joyride, even speeding while behind the wheel.

That's what a Clay County man said happened when he took his car to Firestone for service.

The car's owner, Tony Anderson, said he may have never known what happened if not for the dashcam in his car which caught the technician on video. Anderson said he could hardly believe his eyes when he saw it.

“(I was in) disbelief, trying to figure out, 'Is he really doing this,?' said Anderson as he watched the dash cam video.

He was aware the Firestone technician took his car out for a spin after an oil change because of a dashcam installed only a few months earlier.

The camera caught the driver at top speeds of 62 mph in a 25 mph zone.

“No way I would be driving my car like that through a neighborhood,” said Anderson.

News4JAX Consumer Investigator Lauren Verno went to the Firestone on Blanding Blvd. in Orange Park to get answers.

She told the manager that we had a customer come to us saying that a mechanic took their car out after an oil change and tire alignment.

The manager responded by saying; ""I have to speak with my home office before I speak with you.”

The manager went into an office for a few minutes and came back

""I can tell you we don’t approve of anything like that. We don’t condone that and we’re handling the situation. Before I can do anything, I need to speak to our home office.”

News4Jax asked if the employee still worked at Firestone.

“Not at this point but it’s still going though the processes of disciplinary actions,” said the Firestone manager.

Firestone did reach back out to us to request more details, then released the following statement late Wednesday afternoon.

Bridgestone Retail Operations Statement regarding incident at Orange Park Firestone Complete Auto Care:

""Bridgestone Retail Operations is committed to treating customers and their vehicles with care and respect. The incident that occurred at the Firestone Complete Auto Care store in Orange Park, Florida is rare and does not in any way reflect the high standards of safety, professionalism and customer service to which our employees are held and evaluated. While specific personnel matters are confidential, we want to assure customers that we take appropriate action any time employee misconduct is identified.""

Anderson said he was mailed two coupons, one for a free oil change, and one for $100 off four tires.

He did not get a refund for the service that day.

1439,Pensacola man accused of 'systematic torture' and 'indescribable' abuse of 2-year-old,"A Pensacola man has been arrested for what Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan described as the ""systematic torture"" and horrific abuse of a 2-year-old girl.

“The truly heinous nature of this crime is in some cases truly indescribable,” Morgan said.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, is accused of not allowing a 2-year-old girl to sleep, using a variety of ways to shock her out of sleep if she drifted off. He utilized methods such as throwing half empty and then full bottles of milk at her as she began to nod off to sleep or had just fallen asleep, according to ECSO Chief Deputy Chip Simmons.

Investigators obtained video clips, allegedly made by Celaius, of him placing an electric-dog collar around her neck and electrocuting her awake, Simmons said. When the girl woke up she was faced with the sight of Celaius starring down at her wearing a werewolf mask.

“You can image a 2-year-old child being awoke in the middle of the night,” Morgan said, “and she is starring at this frightful image.”

Celaius also allegedly shot her with an airsoft gun.

Morgan said Celaius was the boyfriend of the child’s mother, but not the girl’s father.

The mother was originally arrested for neglect and was released after making bond, Morgan said. But the Sheriff’s Office and the State Attorney’s Office no longer believes she was aware of what Celaius had been doing to her child.

“When we played the videos to her, she … she acted appropriately,” Morgan said, indicating the mother had become highly upset.

According to investigators, the abuses came to light after the girl’s mother took her to Sacred Heart Hospital after discovering markings on the girl’s skin. The mother thought the marks were caused by an illness, possibly ringworm.

But, investigators said, emergency room physicians quickly informed the mom that the marks were not the result of ring worm and that the discolorations could only be the result of burns.

The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office was contacted and an investigation into possible child abuse was opened.

Celaius used a lighter to burn the child, Morgan said.

Simmons said investigators seized hours of recorded footage of Celaius abusing the girl, which he had filmed on multiple cameras and cellphone cameras.

Eric Furnans (Photo: Courtesy of the Escambia County Jail)

According to Simmons, Celaius placed a call from jail to a friend, Eric Everett Furnans. Celaius asked Furnans to destroy his cellphone, which he allegedly did.

Furnans was arrested Wednesday and faces charges of evidence destruction, tampering with evidence, possession of drug paraphernalia, three counts of possession of a controlled substance without a prescription and possession of marijuana.

SPRING HILL, Fla. (WFLA) - A man was found dead inside a burning home in Spring Hill late Tuesday night, according to Hernando County Fire Rescue.

Deputies responded to a call Tuesday night of a fully involved house fire just before 11:45 p.m. at 6444 Barclay Avenue after receiving calls of flames coming from the roof from people in the area.

When fire rescue arrived witnesses told fire crews a person there could possibly be someone in the house. Fire rescue crews attempted to call for the person by knocking on the door but received no response, the report stated.

While trying to contain the fire a portion of the roof collapsed, officials said. Once crews were able to extinguish the fire crews did locate a male victim inside the structure. Information on the victim is being withheld until notification of next of kin is confirmed.

The Bureau of Fire and Arson Investigations has been called to investigate the fire.

1445,Man pleads guilty in home invasion that left his brother dead,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Jacksonville man once charged with murder in the 2016 home invasion that led to his brother’s death has been sentenced to prison time after pleading guilty to a lesser charge.

Lucky Marcel Cox, 30, pleaded guilty to attempted armed robbery as part of an agreement with prosecutors that saw them drop felony murder and armed burglary charges, court records show.

He was sentenced to 30 months in prison with credit for 20 months he’s already served behind bars.

Cox was arrested on unrelated charges Nov. 11, 2016, the night his brother, Sergio, was killed in the midst of a home invasion at an apartment in the Baymeadows neighborhood, according to police.

According to his arrest report, Cox was present when his brother and another man barged into the apartment that night and got into a struggle with a man inside, who shot and killed Cox's brother.

Because of that, Cox was charged with felony murder. In Florida, someone charged with a felony offense can also be charged with murder if another person dies during the act of the felony crime.

BALTIMORE (AP) - Tyler Glasnow pitched seven innings of three-hit ball to earn his major league-leading sixth win, and the Tampa Bay Rays got a slump-breaking homer from Mike Zunino in a 7-0 rout of the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night.

Glasnow (6-0) struck out eight, walked none and lowered his AL-best ERA to 1.47. It's been an impressive turnaround for the right-hander, who entered this season with a 4-16 lifetime record.

The first time Glasnow went up against Baltimore this season, he retired the last 10 batters he faced in a 4-2 victory. This time, Glasnow started with 11 straight outs before Dwight Smith Jr. beat out an infield grounder.

Glasnow gave up a single in each of the next two innings but did not allow a runner past first base. He is the first pitcher in franchise history to begin the season with seven consecutive starts of at least five innings without yielding more than two runs.

On this occasion, Glasnow received ample offensive support from a variety of teammates. Zunino snapped an 0-for-17 skid with a three-run homer off Dan Straily (1-2) to make it 4-0 in the fourth inning, Tommy Pham had three hits and two RBIs and rookie Nate Lowe picked up his first big league RBI with a sacrifice fly in the sixth.

In an AL East matchup between the first place Rays and the last place Orioles, Tampa Bay got the only run it needed before Straily recorded the first out.

Brandon Lowe and Pham opened the game with successive doubles for a 1-0 lead. The Rays wasted a leadoff triple by Kevin Kiermaier in the second but batted around in a four-run fourth that including a sacrifice fly by Ji-Man Choi.

Baltimore finished with five hits, all of them singles, in falling to 3-11 at home.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Rays: INF Matt Duffy (hamstring tightness) began his rehabilitation assignment Friday night with Class A Charlotte., going 0 for 3 and playing third base. ""We'll just kind of take it day to day and see what we're hearing from him,"" manager Kevin Cash said. ... RHP Jose De Leon (Tommy John surgery) is slated to pitch two inning for Charlotte on Saturday, his first outing since August 2017. ... OF Austin Meadows (right thumb sprain) had the cast removed and has started to hit off a tee.

Orioles: LHP Richard Bleier (left shoulder tendinitis) has been throwing well in extended spring training and ""coming out of games healthy,"" according to manager Brandon Hyde. Bleier's velocity is on the rise but Hyde said there is no timetable for his return. ... Eager to get back to the big leagues after a 20-game debut in 2017, minor league OF Austin Hays (thumb injury) began his rehab assignment with a six-inning stint in extended spring training.

UP NEXT

Rays: RHP Yonny Chirinos (4-0, 3.48 ERA) plays the role of the opener Saturday, making his fourth start and seventh appearance of the season. He's averaged six innings in his three starts.

Orioles: RHP Dylan Bundy (0-4, 6.67) starts for the seventh time, still looking for his first win of 2019.

1455,"Kiker recalled as a leader open to new ideas, but with the ability to persuade","CLOSE Lee County Commissioner Larry Kiker died on April 23, 2019. He was 67. Oscar Santiago Torres and Bill Smith, Wochit

More than 500 people – family members, local political and business figures and friends he met in his years living and working in Fort Myers Beach – shared stories and memories Thursday during services for Larry Kiker, the late chairman of the Board of County Commissioners for Lee County.

Kiker died Tuesday, April 23 at Hope Hospice at Healthpark after a five month battle with lymphoma.

In eulogizing Kiker, local real estate entrepreneur Stan Stouder referred to the late commissioner as simultaneously respectable and relatable. Stouder focused on Kiker's leadership roles and his willingness to take risks and to challenge ideas that had become conventional.

""He was never okay with 'that's the way we've always done it,'"" Stouder said. ""That was never an answer that was acceptable.""

Watch replay: Memorial service for Lee County Commissioner Larry Kiker

Kiker

The service lasted close to an hour and included remarks from current leaders of the two elected boards on which Kiker served, the Fort Myers Beach Town Council and the Board of County Commissioners.

""His absence in this world is palpable,"" said Anita Cereceda, one of Kiker's successors as mayor of Fort Myers Beach. ""I like to think of him up in heaven, sitting at a big conference table with only the smartest of angels around — in my mind, St Peter is coming into the room for a presentation, clueless that he doesn't stand a chance once Larry starts his pitch.""

Stouder found Kiker's pitch in favor of one or another public policy position less the product of imposing his will than in listening to others and encouraging them to challenge the way things had always been.

""He was not a yes man,"" Stouder said. ""Larry woud call, not often, but he would call and try to roundtable an idea. He wasn't calling to confirm his conclusion, he wasn't calling to affirm his view, he was calling to get a perspective.""

For most of his time in Southwest Florida, Kiker lived with his wife, Paula, in Fort Myers Beach. The couple later moved to south Fort Myers after selling their beach home.

Kiker's first public office was a member of the Fort Myers Beach Town Council, where his colleagues elected him to the largely ceremonial post of mayor for five years. He then ran for county commissioner, defeating incumbent Ray Judah in the Republican primary in 2012

Before entering politics, Kiker worked in the burgeoning high technology industry, with customer service positions at companies such as Sun Microsysterms, Data General Corp. and IBM.

Thursday's service, which were held overlooking the Gulf waters from which he cruised into Fort Myers Beach for a one-night stay only to remain for the rest of his life, focused on Kiker's relationship with his wife Paula and his political life over the past few years

""When I think about Larry, I think about what a servant leader he was,"" Stouder said. ""He wasn't about Larry, it wasn't about what Larry could get out of this — he made great changes because I think he really cared about us, he really led as a servant leader.""

Brian Hamman, who serves as vice chairman of the county commission, spoke on behalf of the board, relating how Kiker's strong philosophical differences with Commissioner Frank Mann would sometimes yield what he termed ""violent agreement,"" to the good-natured surprise of both.

""All of us remember Larry as more than a colleague,' Hamman said. ""He was our friend. That's more important than any program or policy that we passed.""

1456,"State consultant admits to causing hole in Belcher Road, agrees to pay bill","CLEARWATER, Fla. (WFLA) - Katherine Germano finally has results.

More than a month after she ran over a mysterious man-made hole in Belcher Road, the company who cut the hole has agreed to pay for the damage it caused to her Volkswagen Beetle.

Germano had just turned onto Belcher Road from Gulf-to-Bay Boulevard when she heard a loud bang. She didn't see the hole and had no warning.

A Better Call Behnken investigation highlighted the $1,000 in damage the hole caused to her car.

The road is owned by Pinellas County, but the county and the city of Clearwater kept blaming each other for the hole and no one would pay for the damage.

The county fixed the hole as soon as Germano told them about it, but didn't know who was responsible. It's the kind of hole a worker might dig to make repairs to utilities under a roadway.

Two weeks after we contacted the county, they figured out who caused the hole.

Clearwater company Cumbey & Fair, a consultant for FDOT, cut the hole in 2016 to locate a county water line. They failed to pull a permit, and the work was never inspected by the county.

Recently, that patch failed and then Germano ran over it. The county fixed the hole, but wouldn't pay to fix her car.

The county sent this statement:

Following a damage claim made by Ms. Germano, Pinellas County started an investigation to determine where the hole originated. The county determined the following information:

A cut in the road was performed by a Florida Department of Transportation Consultant (Cumbey & Fair) in early 2016 as part of a project to add a westbound right turn lane at the intersection of SR 60 & Belcher.

This cut was made to locate a county water line, according to the consultant.

The work was done without obtaining a county right-of-way use permit; the consultant advised they assumed a County permit was not required. The county reminded the consultant of the necessity for obtaining a permit for all right-of-way work.

Based on the photos and Google Images, there is nothing to suggest that the repair to the original cut was performed improperly.

Tim Bourne of Cumbey & Fair tells 8 On Your Side he had no idea this was going on until our investigation. Now that he knows, he says he'll pay for the damage.",http://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/better-call-behnken/state-consultant-admits-to-causing-hole-in-belcher-road-agrees-to-pay-bill/1974018838,2019-05-02T21:46:22Z,WFLA,Florida Man,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

Jones is accused Feb. 17, 2018, of confronting a woman in St. Lucie County who told investigators she was by herself in her home.

She said she was in her bedroom and noticed a man standing in the doorway to her closet. The man had her wallet in one hand, and a handgun in the other.

The man said he wanted money, but then said he wanted sex. Scared, the woman said she agreed as he still had the handgun. She said he made advances, but she was able to run out to a neighbor’s home to call 911.

Within about 40 minutes at a home less than 2 miles away, investigators said another violent incident occurred.

A woman said she was watching television in her den, and saw a man in the doorway.

She said he demanded money and pointed a handgun at her.

She gave him money, and he took the keys to her Buick. She said he drove away in the vehicle, which sheriff’s officials said turned up the next day in Vero Beach.

A few days later, one of the women told sheriff’s investigators she recognized a mugshot while browsing an Indian River County sheriff’s social media site.

That person was Jones, who investigators said had been arrested two days after the incidents in St. Lucie County. At the time, investigators said he had a BB gun that looked like a real firearm, a pocket knife and other items.

Sheriff’s officials said Jones was linked to both cases in St. Lucie County.

He was held Thursday on no bond, a jail official said.

1463,"Gunman steals shoes from teen walking to bus stop, Lake County deputies say","LAKE COUNTY, Fla. - A man with a gun forced a teenager to give him his shoes as the boy was walking to a bus stop Thursday, according to the Lake County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies said the boy was walking around 11 a.m. when a man on a four-wheeler approached him then a few minutes later the suspect, James Christopher White, approached from a nearby yard and started demanding the victim's shoes.

The victim told the men no three times before White pulled a gun out of his pocket, cocked it back and said, ""Give me your shoes,"" while pointing the firearm at the ground, the arrest report said.

At that point, the victim was afraid so he gave White the shoes, according to the affidavit.

The 15-year-old victim told a friend and that friend's mother confronted White and got the shoes back, authorities said.

On Tuesday, the boy's parents contacted authorities about pressing charges in the case. Deputies said they located White that same day and when he saw them, he started running but was quickly taken into custody.

White spontaneously uttered, ""I don't know about no gun and shoes,"" according to the report.

He was arrested on charges of robbery with a firearm and petit theft.

1464,Cape Coral man charged with threatening judges; Facebook posts stemmed from custody issue,"CLOSE Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno addresses members of the media Tuesday, April 30, 2019 in Cape Coral in regards to an ongoing threat investigation. Ricardo Rolon, Fort Myers News-Press

A Cape Coral man charged with multiple offenses after he posted on Facebook that Lee County judges should die and led deputies on a chase that ended in his arrest remains in Lee County jail on $465,000 bond.

William Daniel Seyfried, 43, now faces seven charges including aggravated assault on an officer, threatening a judge with death or serious harm, threatening to discharge a destructive device, make or attempting to make a destructive device, fleeing and eluding law enforcement and threaten with death or serious bodily harm.

Seyfried made his first appearance in Lee County Court on Wednesday and will be arraigned June 3.

A report from the Lee County Sheriff's Office said an investigation began Monday into Seyfried's Facebook remarks with several posts and videos showing him with a semi-automatic rifle and a discussion of components used to build explosives.

One post showed a blue container and the description ""FILLED WITH DIESEL STUMP REMOVER A SPARK PLUG AND A LONG (EXPLETIVE) WIRE"".

Seyfried's Facebook comments stemmed from a child custody issue. He also has a past arrest and numerous charges including battery, kidnapping and resisting arrest. Court documents showed several domestic violence cases between him and his wife, Lysanda Seyfried, in September and October.

Lysanda Seyfried is listed as owner of the Northwest 15th Terrace home in Cape Coral.

Initial contact by deputies with Seyfried at Northwest 15th Terrace resulted in him yelling at deputies that they were trespassing and should leave, the report said.

The report said Seyfried armed himself with a bow and arrow, a baseball bat and a machete and broadcast a Facebook Live video saying he was ""going invisible."" The Sheriff's Office report said deputies thought Seyfried might try to detonate an explosive device.

Seyfried was able to leave his home and deputies gave chase, colliding with his vehicle but failing to contain him. Seyfried left the collision area.

A woman claiming to be Seyfried's sister reported to the Sheriff's Office that he was parked next to her home. The report said deputies and Cape Coral police units then began pursuing Seyfried again eventually stopping him using the PIT maneuver, a pursuit tactic police use to force a fleeing car to turn sideways abruptly, causing the driver to lose control and stop.

A relative of Seyfried told deputies he claimed to have a live grenade. A search of the 1113 NW 15th address found several ""items of interest,"" Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said.

1468,Miami-Dade man accused of neglecting over 200 farm animals,"MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - A North Miami Beach man was arrested Tuesday after police said he kept more than 200 farm animals on his property in squalid, cramped conditions. Authorities said many of the animals did not have proper access to food and clean water and lacked much-needed medical care.

Dvir Derhy, 50, faces multiple charges of animal cruelty.

According to the arrest report, Derhy had hired a man to care for the animals in exchange for allowing the man to stay in a camper on a property in the 26700 block of Southwest 182nd Avenue in southwest Miami-Dade County. However, the tenant contacted authorities after he said Derhy ignored his concerns about how the animals were being treated.

When officers arrived on the property in late December, they found hundreds of animals -- including goats, sheep, horses, donkeys, cows, pigs, emus, llamas, alpacas, turkeys, geese, ducks, chickens and guinea fowl – all living in the same penned-in area, the report said.

The ground was covered in urine, feces and sharp rocks without any comfortable places for the animals to sleep, the report said. Police said Derhy kept the animals’ food in a trailer that was inaccessible to the smaller animals. As result, the larger animals became of obese and the smaller, weaker animals were severely malnourished, the report said.

The animals had not been groomed so they maintained heavy coats despite the South Florida heat.

Many of the animals had untreated medical conditions that affected their vision and ability to walk. Derhy told the officers he didn’t take the animals to a veterinarian because he didn’t have the money and it was cheaper to buy another animal, the report said.

Police were assisted by the South Florida Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Miami-Dade County Animal Service Department as they moved the animals off the property.

Out of the 206 animals seized by the authorities, four had to be euthanized and 60 required immediate medical care. One llama was so underfed that it died of starvation a few days after the animal was taken by animal control officials. Many of the animals were still recovering three months after they were seized, the report said.

Officials with the SFSPCA said all the animals were being cared for by their organization, but the influx of animals has put a strain on their finances. After the rescue -- dubbed Operation Noah's Arc -- the population of SFSPCA Homestead ranch grew by 400%. Many of the animals were pregnant when they were taken and have since given birth, adding to the numbers.

As of Tuesday afternoon, Derhy was being held on more than $400,000 bond at Miami-Dade County’s Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center.

1481,Housing elderly sex offenders,"""Nobody wants him,"" she said. ""Nobody wants a sex offender.""

TALLAHASSEE — Since 82-year-old Leonard Bailey hit his head in a fall eight months ago, he can't remember to take his medicine.

His ex-wife, Marianne Devita, calls him 11 times a day to remind him about his appointments.

At that stage of dementia, many families would consider admitting him to a nursing home, but Devita said she has a list of assisted living homes that have rejected Bailey. The pages lined up are as tall as Devita's grandson — whom Bailey has never seen.

""Nobody wants him,"" she said. ""Nobody wants a sex offender.""

Bailey is among a growing number of elderly sex offenders: People on Florida's list of 73,000 registered offenders who are 65 and older jumped 2 percentage points between 2015 and 2016, according to the state's legislative auditors, the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability. Florida's registry has about 10,200 elderly offenders.

The problem is sparking a national crisis of social and justice policy: How and where do we allow the most-reviled class of citizens to survive their silver years - especially those with serious age-related medical problems - after they have served their prison terms, while striving to protect children who may be living nearby?

For offenders like Bailey who can't live without assistance, nursing or retirement homes are not a guarantee. Even if the retirement home isn't within 1,000 feet of schools and parks, as required the state's sex offender residency restrictions, managers of nursing homes often reject elderly felons.

The state policy for long-term care homes is this: Management can choose to accept or reject applicants. Some other states, and Hillsborough County, have residency restrictions within 1,000 feet of places where seniors live, including nursing homes. States, counties and cities have different rules limiting where offenders can live.

In Iowa, the 2017 legislature considered a bill that would have created a committee that studied the feasibility of building a long-term care facility for offenders.

Privately owned assisted living homes have reasons for rejecting offenders. They may be financially responsible for lawsuits if a resident is assaulted by another resident with a criminal history. A Pennsylvania nursing home agreed to pay $6.75 million in damages to the estate of a resident who was assaulted there. The home knew the resident who assaulted her was a registered offender.

Oak Hammock, a University of Florida-managed retirement community in Gainesville, said it prioritizes resident safety and screens for sex-related criminal histories. It does not accept predators.

Assisted-living homes may also face reputational damage and lose other prospective clients if their commercial addresses show up on sex-offender registries.

Living at home isn't always an option for offenders either. When offenders' families are unable to move from areas near school or parks, offenders seek housing elsewhere.

Bailey was arrested for touching a minor in Florida while he was on vacation with Devita from their home in Long Island, New York.

Devita is still in New York, driving her 14-year-old grandson to school in the mornings, helping her daughter-in-law with chores. Bailey remains near where he was in prison. He is driven to court-mandated therapy and the sheriff's office.

When Bailey put a girl's hand in his pocket and asked her if she felt his ""little leg,"" he was 74. Now Devita said Bailey, who uses a cane, can't live on his own anymore. After he hit his head in the bathroom, it took her calling him 37 times before he was able to reach for the phone.

""Help me"" is all he said.

Since then, he often forgets his ""black box"" that pairs with the bracelet around his ankle to monitor his location. He's already been sent to prison for misplacing the device before and his parole officer has warned him the next time it happens he will be sent back.

Bailey can't help but forget.

""I'm getting too old to fight about this,"" he said. ""I don't care.""

For some victim advocates, any risk that a sex offender might lapse back into criminal behavior is too high. Ron Book, a former legislator, lobbied for Florida's restrictions after his daughter, who is now a state senator, was assaulted by her nanny in the late '90s and early 2000s.

He said he has met elderly offenders and is aware of cases when they committed new crimes. He does not think the state should change laws to account for the aging offender population.

""Sex crimes are sex crimes,"" he said. ""Doesn't matter if they're 18 or 98.""

Researchers have found that the chance of recidivism decreases by half every five years an offender is out of prison, said Jill Levenson, professor of social work at Barry University and an expert in sex offender treatment and policy.

She predicts that offenders will live together and provide care to each other.

This is already happening, according to sheriff's offices responses in the state's accountability office survey.

Residency restrictions are the most common hurdle for offenders searching for housing, with unwilling property managers a close second reason. Both contribute to the growth of enclave communities where offenders live together, usually in mobile home parks.

There are no known, comprehensive lists of communities or neighborhoods that accept sex offenders. Some in Florida include a St. Petersburg trailer park that was the subject of a 2016 documentary called ""Pervert Park.""

Lori Nassofer, who helps sex offenders 55 and older find housing in Central Florida, owns three mobile home parks near Orlando. ""NO CHILDREN"" signs are posted at the driveway.

The business of finding offenders housing is booming. There are no vacancies in Nassofer's parks.

Ron Johnson manages Overland Village for Nassofer, a mobile home park in Apopka. He said he receives 30 to 40 calls a week. He is kept busy coordinating housing for sex offenders recently released from prison.

Sex offenders in Florida must already have an address they will live at before they can leave prison.

""It's taking calls all the time,"" Johnson said. ""Taking phone calls, dealing with probation, prisons, release coordinators, hospitals — you name it.""

Finding housing is considered one of the biggest barriers for sex offenders recently released from prison. Federal rental assistance in public housing is not available to sex offenders.

Johnson said sex offenders risk being gouged for rent when they have no other options. At Nassofer's parks, most offenders already own their trailers or rent from each other. She charges $350 for land rent and covers utilities.

Many of the offenders have Social Security benefits, Medicare and Medicaid. Some get financial help from family or friends. Few have jobs.

Bailey receives $1,200 a month for Social Security and pays his roommate, Paul Casey, $500 for a room in his trailer.

Most of the elderly offenders in the park have relatively younger roommates who take care of them. Johnson takes care of elderly in his park, including a man in a wheelchair.

""I shouldn't have him because I can't care for him,"" he said. ""But what is he going to do?""

Well, April has come and gone in a dizzying, colorful blur. Literature, film, music, dance, theater, art — all the cultural bases were covered in one of the most delightful spring months in memory.

Now it’s time to take a breath and contemplate the change in seasons. Summer is a-coming in, friends. The pace will slow to a mosey and there will be time to kick back and contemplate the clouds and the waves, the tomatoes in your garden and the inside of your eyelids.

Which is not to say the cultural whirl ceases - it eases back to more of a gentle eddy. There’s still plenty of music, theater (“Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!”) and more in store. It just won’t come in a big rush — it’ll be more like a soft summer breeze caressing your cheek.

BEDFORD, Va. (AP) — Prosecutors say a Chevy-versus-Ford argument escalated and ended with a man shooting his girlfriend and her son.

Mark Edwin Turner was arrested last week after he barricaded himself in a home for more than two hours. Turner was charged with malicious wounding and weapons charges.

The News & Advance reports that a prosecutor said in court Monday that Turner was at a family dinner when he began to argue with his girlfriend’s adult son about the merits of cars made by Chevrolet versus cars made by Ford.

The prosecutor said the fight escalated, with Turner producing a knife and then a handgun. In a scuffle, Turned ended up shooting his girlfriend five times and her son once. Both received serious injuries.

The prosecutor said Turner appeared to be heavily intoxicated.

1486,"FWC extends harvest prohibition in red tide areas, holds off on new trout regulations","CLOSE Recreational anglers are about to receive reduced bag limits on trout, which they welcome, but commercial fishing data may indicate a larger problem. Ed Killer, ed.killer@tcpalm.com

The 7-member, governor-appointed Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission made two important decisions Wednesday morning during its regularly-scheduled meeting in Havana, near Tallahassee. Both will have future impacts on recreational fishing in Florida.

The commission approved an FWC staff recommendation to continue catch and release measures currently in place for red drum (redfish) and snook from the Pasco-Hernando county line through Gordon Pass in Collier County for one year. An executive order from August 2018 prohibited harvest of snook and redfish in red tide affected waters where massive fish kills took place last summer. In September, the order was extended to cover the waters of Tampa Bay north to Pasco County, and to be in place through May 10, 2019. In February 2019, additional catch and release measures were put in place to prohibit harvest of spotted seatrout larger than 20 inches.

Wednesday, the FWC voted to continue to keep snook and redfish catch and release only through next year, re-evaluating snook prior to the March 1, 2020 spring season opener for state waters of the Gulf of Mexico. It also voted to expand the prohibition on harvest of all sizes of seatrout for one year from Pasco-Hernando county line through Gordon Pass in Collier County. The measures will be in effect until May 31, 2020.

More: Toxic water, seagrass losses spell serious trouble for Florida's trout fishing

The FWC also decided to prohibit commercial harvest of spotted seatrout in this same area for the next year.

""We support FWC’s response to address red tide impacts on our iconic southwest Florida fisheries,"" said Kellie Ralston, Southeast Fisheries Policy Director for the American Sportfishing Association. ""Extending and expanding catch and release requirements for an additional year will allow redfish, snook and spotted seatrout stocks to recover from the devastating bloom last year. We look forward to revisiting the status of these stocks after they’ve had this important time to rebuild.""

This is the zone affected in 2018 by red tide fish kills and will now have a prohibition on recreational harvest of snook, redfish and trout until May 31, 2020. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED MAP BY FWC)

In another measure which addressed spotted seatrout stocks statewide, the FWC directed staff to further examine the economically important species and account for some of the issues brought up during the public comment period Wednesday. Staff had made recommendations to reduce recreational trout fishing bag limits in each of the four management zones in state waters, but will now delay that move until later in the year.

Grouper season open

May 1 is the opening of the recreational fishing season for grouper and hogfish in South Atlantic waters, including those off the coast of Florida.

The following species may now be harvested in state and federal waters: hogfish; gag grouper, black grouper, red grouper, yellowmouth grouper and yellowfin grouper; scamp; red hind; rock hind; coney; and graysby.

Hogfish will remain open through Oct. 31, 2019, on the east coast of Florida as well as south and east of Cape Sable on the Gulf coast. The other species will remain open through Dec. 31, 2019, on the east coast of Florida and all state waters off Monroe County.

Unfortunately, because of an early season tropical disturbance in the Atlantic Ocean just off the Florida coast, easterly winds and rough seas will likely prevent offshore anglers from being able to successfully target grouper until Friday or Saturday, at the earliest. Grouper are typically caught on deep reefs in 90-160 feet of water. Hogfish are most commonly caught by divers who are spearfishing. They rarely take a baited hook.

The Florida record hogfish, 19 pounds, 8 ounces, was landed in 1962 by Robert Batson off Daytona Beach. The state record gag grouper was 80 pounds, 6 ounces caught off Destin by Bill Smith in 1993. The state record black grouper weighed 113 pounds, 6 ounces and was caught off the Dry Tortugas in 1990 by Donald Bone.

A 28-year-old man who is a young father suffered a major stroke.Josh Hader, of Guthrie, tore an artery in his neck leading to his brain. The cause of the stroke? He popped his neck.“The moment I heard the pop, everything on my left side started to go numb,” Hader said. “I got up and tried to get an ice pack from the fridge, and I remember I couldn't walk straight.”His father-in-law rushed him to the emergency room.“I had about six or seven nurses and doctors surrounding me,” Hader said. “He could have formed more clot on that tear and had a life-ending stroke. He could have died,” said Dr. Vance McCollom, at Mercy Hospital.McCollom showed us Hader’s X-rays. Hader tore his vertebral artery, a crucial vessel leading to the brain.“If you have a stroke in that area, you can end up with a patient (who's) locked in,” McCollom said. “They completely understand what's going on, but they can't communicate. They can't move anything. They can't speak. They can't breathe.”Thankfully, Hader’s stroke wasn't that significant. But it did cause a lot of damage.“One of the muscles that goes to his eye is weak because the nerve was injured,” McCollom said.Hader had to wear an eyepatch for several days.“Double vision. Blurry vision,” Hader said.Doctors decided Hader’s condition was best treated with medicine and physical therapy.“For the first few days, I couldn't walk without a walker,” Hader said. Even though the walker is now put away, he still has a lot of trouble.“It is difficult to walk with my left leg,” Hader said.Also, Hader said he has a very strange side effect: He had hiccups for a week and a half straight, painful hiccups that, he said, nearly caused a panic attack. But Hader told KOCO 5 the most difficult part has been emotional -- not being able to help his wife with their two young children.“I can't pick him up out of the crib, give him milk in the middle of the night. I can't do any of that,” Hader said.KOCO 5 asked the doctor if there's any safe way to pop your neck.“If you want to pop your neck, just kind of pop it side to side. Don't twist it,” McCollom said. “Whenever you twist it, there's a risk of tearing that vessel. Say my hand is his head, I suspect he just turned it real sharp and up, sharp and up and back. That's what really pinched it.”Before Hader went into his procedure, he wanted to tell his wife one thing.“He wanted to tell his wife he was sorry that he had popped his neck,” McCollom said. “His wife had been telling him, ‘Don't pop your neck. You're going to cause a stroke.’”May is Stroke Awareness Month. Hader and his doctors want to remind you of the FAST symptoms of stroke:F is for face -- Are you seeing any drooping?A is for arms-- Do notice a drift or weakness to one arm when holding both in front of you? S is for speech -- Is your speech slurred?T is for time, as your life hangs in the balance.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/28-year-old-man-suffers-stroke-from-cracking-his-neck/27338422,2019-05-02T01:35:00Z,WPBF-TV,Florida Man,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

1492,Telenovela star formally charged with manslaughter in road rage death,"MIAMI - Telenovela star Pablo Lyle appeared in court Wednesday for his arraignment, where he was formally charged with manslaughter in a road rage incident that led to the death of 63-year-old Juan Ricardo Hernandez.

Prosecutors had said last month that they were considering charging Lyle, 32, with second-degree murder and asked that he be held in lieu of a $1 million bond.

His attorneys argued that their client couldn't afford that steep bond and said he is a good man who has been cooperative in the investigation and willingly traveled back to Miami from Mexico to face the charge against him.

A Miami-Dade County judge ultimately set Lyle's bond at $50,000 and ordered he be placed on house arrest and fitted with a GPS monitor.

The judge kept Lyle's bond at $50,000 Wednesday and said the actor will remain on house arrest at this time.

Surveillance video captured the March 31 road rage incident at Northwest 27th Avenue and Northwest 14th Street.

According to authorities, Lyle was in the passenger seat of a red SUV heading to Miami International Airport when the SUV appeared to cut off a blue car driven by Hernandez.

Hernandez, apparently upset, gets out his car at the red light and approaches the driver in the video.

The driver gets out and the pair exchange words as the SUV rolls toward the intersection, the video shows.

The driver dashes back to catch the car when the actor appears to get out of the passenger seat, go toward Hernandez and throw a punch that knocks the man out of frame onto the street, the video shows.

Lyle then gets back in his car, which is full of family members, and the driver makes a U-turn and they leave the scene.

Lyle's attorneys claim the surveillance video has been sped up.

Hernandez, who suffered a head injury, was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he later died.

A witness who snapped a picture of the license plate helped lead police to the airport, where Lyle and the driver surrendered, authorities said.

The driver has not been arrested in the case.

According to authorities, Lyle claims he threw the punch because he was scared for his family's safety after Hernandez approached their vehicle and pounded on the window.

1494,"Suspect tells Pensacola police that, yes, he did shoot someone with his shotgun","A 45-year-old man was arrested by Pensacola police Monday night after admitting to shooting another man in the left leg with a shotgun earlier that evening.

Steven Hodges was charged with aggravated battery using a deadly weapon and was subsequently booked into the Escambia County Jail at 9:33 p.m. Monday. His bond was set at $15,000, according to county records.

Earlier that evening, police responded to a possible shooting in the 500 block of East Desoto Street. Officers found a man lying on the ground who had sustained a gunshot wound to his left leg, according to an arrest report.

Before being transported to the hospital, the man provided law enforcement with the home address of his alleged attacker.

Officers found Hodges standing inside a fenced-off yard at the address provided. A shotgun was laying on the ground behind Hodges, the report stated. Hodges then told police that he had shot the man.

Hodges told officers that the man had come to his house earlier on Monday and showed him a pistol, the report stated. On Monday evening, Hodges said he had been sitting outside of his house with his uncle and two other people when the man came back.

Hodges told authorities that at some point the man put his hand on his hip and Hodges assumed the man was reaching for the same gun he’d shown Hodges earlier in the day, the report stated.

So, Hodges said, he walked into his house, picked up a shotgun resting behind the door, walked back outside and shot the man, the report stated.

Both Hodges and his uncle told officers that after the shotgun blast sounded, they heard six additional gunshots, the report stated.

Hodges’s uncle told officers that he witnessed his nephew shoot the man, and immediately following getting shot, the man shot back at his nephew with a two-tone, silver and black pistol.

Hodges made bail Tuesday morning and was released from the Escambia County Jail at 10:31 a.m.

CLEARWATER, Fla. - Jurors are deliberating the fate of a Florida man accused of throwing his 5-year-old daughter off a Tampa Bay area bridge.

During closing arguments on Tuesday, prosecutors said Jonchuck knew what he was doing when he dropped Phoebe Jonchuck 62 feet (18 meters) to her death four years ago. Defense attorneys say Jonchuck was insane at the time.

Jonchuck faces life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder. Jurors also could find him not guilty by reason of insanity and the judge could send him to a mental health center, where he could eventually be released if doctors deem him fit.
