4,Man injured after device explodes outside California diner,"FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) — A man suffered serious injuries to his hands and face Friday after a device he was holding exploded near a Southern California diner, police said.

Fullerton police Lt. Jon Radus said authorities received a call around 8:50 a.m. about the explosion in the city some 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles.

Initially, police were told it could be an electrical box and evacuated nearby businesses, he said. Investigators later determined the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device and found a second improvised explosive device in the area, he said.

“We believe they were his,” Radus said, adding that police would seek to have the 59-year-old man criminally charged.

The man was taken to the hospital with serious injuries to his fingers, face and throat, Radus said. Police declined to provide the man’s name.

8,Suspected Northern California killer may be headed south to avoid arrest,"Joshua Vaden (Photo: Sacramento County Sheriff's Department)

SACRAMENTO — A Northern California man is on the run.

The FBI believes he is headed south to escape arrest and are asking for the public's help to find the man wanted in connection with an April homicide.

Joshua Thomas Vaden, 30, is accused of fleeing Sacramento after an April homicide investigation.

On Wednesday, the FBI got a federal warrant for Vaden for ""unlawful flight to avoid prosecution."" Authorities believe Vaden may be heading to Mexico, fleeing south on Highway 99 or Interstate 5.

On April 14, the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department was called to a home in the 7000 block of Peevey Court in south Sacramento.

The caller said he went to the home and found his family member dead inside. The victim had been ""violently"" assaulted before being slain, according to deputies.

During their investigation, homicide detectives and crime scene investigators identified Vaden as the killer.

Vaden has an active warrant in Sacramento County for the homicide.

He is described as a black man, 5-feet, 9 inches tall with dark brown hair and brown eyes.

Sacramento County detectives are also looking to identify a person of interest and are trying to locate a vehicle associated with the victim, a gray 2017 Ford Fiesta with Illinois license plate AM73381.

Anyone with information about the man’s location or person involved is urged to call the FBI Sacramento Field Office at (916) 746-7000. Tips may also be submitted anonymously to tips.fbi.gov.

BRIAN: TRATTNER WAS TAKEN TO COURT, CONVICTED AND SENT TO JUVENILE DETENTION WITH PROBATION WHEN HE WAS RELEASED NOW IN HIS TWENTIES, TRATTNER SAYS HE FOUND GOD AND A PURPOSE. >> I ENDED UP WORKING MY WAY TO FIRE CAMP AND FOUGHT FIRES FOR 1.5 YEARS. BRIAN: TRATTNER WAS PART OF AN INMATE CREW THAT HELPED FIGHT SANTA BARBRA’S DEADLY THOMAS FIRE IN DECEMBER OF 2017. HE GOT PAID FOR HIS WORK AND HE USED THAT MONEY TO HELP PAY OFF HIS DEBTS. JUST GOING TO COURT CAN RACK THOUSANDS TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN FEES. EVERYTHING FROM RESTITUTION THE VICTIMS, TO THE COST OF THE COURT CLERK, EVEN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND IT DOESN’T END WHEN YOU LEAVE THE JAILHOUSE. PROBATION CAN TACK ON FEES ONCE YOU GET OUT. >> WE’RE ALREADY PAYING RESTITUTION, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WHY DO WE HAVE ALL THESE JACKED UP COURT FINES AND ALL THESE OTHER EXTRA THINGS ON TOP OF Y KNOW WHAT WE OWE THE VICTIMS I UNDERSTAND THE VICTIMS BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ON TOP OF IT IT’S LIKE EVERYONE’S TRYING TO GET SOMETHING.

IT’S LARGELY OUTSTANDING DEBT THAT SITS ON THE BOOKS FOR YEARS AND YEARS. BRIAN: AND IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY, THE NUMBERS BACK HER UP. LOOKING AT THE 2016-2017 FISCAL YEAR AS AN EXAMPLE, THE COUNTY CHARGED PROBATIONER MORE THAN $7 MILLION IN FEES, BUT IT COLLECTED $2.5 MILLION. NOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT, BUT THE COST TO COLLECT THAT MONEY IS HIGH, TOO. WE’LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER >> IT’S SOMETHING THAT WE ASK ADULT OFFENDERS, PROBABLY RIGHTLY SO, TO PAY OTHERWISE THAT BURDEN GOES TO THE TAXPAYERS. BRIAN: KIM NAVA WITH SACRAMENTO COUNTY SAYS GETTING RID OF THOSE FEES WOULD HURT THE BUDGETS FOR PROBATION, THE SHERIFF, AND TH PUBLIC DEFENDER. SHE SAYS THEIR FINANCE DEPARTMENT WORKS WITH PROBATIONERS TO PAY WITHIN THEIR MEANS. >> IN SOME CASES IF PEOPLE ARE ON GENERAL ASSISTANCE OR IF THEY ARE UNEMPLOYED OR UNDER-EMPLOYED FINANCE WILL WORK WITH THEM TO GREATLY REDUCE THOSE FEES AND IN SOME CASES ZERO THEM OUT. BRIAN: THOUGH MATHEW TRATTNER SAYS HE CANNOT RECALL ANYONE ASKING IF HE WAS FINANCIALLY ABLE TO PAY HIS DOLLAR AMOUNT. NOW THAT HE’S MARRIED, HE SAYS THE COUNTY CONSIDERS HER SALARY AS PART OF HIS INCOME, TOO.

33,California child molester who faked death nabbed in Florida,"CHICO, Calif. (AP) - A Northern California man who police say faked his own suicide to avoid jail for child sexual assault and pornography has been arrested in Florida.

58-year-old Michael Manning, of Chico, California, was arrested in Monroe County, Florida.



Chico police say that Manning had a hearing scheduled on Oct. 6, 2016, to be sentenced on child sexual abuse, child pornography and other charges but he didn't show up.



Chico police say a suicide note in Manning's handwriting was found in a car he rented that was left near Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, but his body was not found.



Deputies in Florida arrested him May 3 after he identified himself with a fake U.S. passport and U.S. Navy identification card during a burglary investigation.

A California Department of Transportation manager commuted some 450 miles to work -- from San Diego to Sacramento -- for two years and the state paid for it, according to an audit released Tuesday.A state hospital administrator also racked up tens of thousands of dollars with long commutes and a prison administrator watched thousands of YouTube videos at work. Those were among the more egregious misuses of taxpayer money outlined in the report on improper activities by state agencies and employees.The California state auditor said investigations completed between July and December of last year identified about $427,000 in inappropriate expenditures. It did not specifically identify any of the people involved in the improprieties.Most of the agencies involved indicated that they had or intended to investigate the misuses and implement training and other reforms to prevent future violations.In one case, the report said a senior management employee with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ""dishonestly represented his work experience and received a promotion to branch chief for which he was not qualified,"" State Auditor Elaine Howle said in a letter to the governor and other officials included in the report. She said as a result of the promotion, the man improperly received nearly $235,000 in compensation.Other violations:- The transportation department reimbursed a manager nearly $42,000 over two years for the costs of airfare, rental cars, meals, lodging and other costs of commuting from her San Diego home to Sacramento, where she was supposed to be headquartered. The manager violated state law by charging the agency for such expenses, the audit concluded.The report said the agency would attempt to collect the money from the manager, who retired last year.- As a result of ""mismanagement and the improper designation of an administrator's headquarters,"" the audit said the Department of State Hospitals wasted nearly $47,800 by paying for an administrator to travel from home to headquarters in Sacramento.- A manager improperly used a state car for his personal commute, racking up nearly 42,000 miles (67,589 kilometers) between his home and the correctional facility where he worked and costing taxpayers some $22,500.- An administrator in the education program at Valley State Prison in Chowchilla accessed more than 2,200 YouTube videos - 55 in one day alone - that were unrelated to his work on his state-issued computer during work hours.""Most of the videos featured recreational vehicles, footage from crimes, and political or religious commentary. To access these videos, the administrator deliberately used his credentials and authority to bypass CDCR's safeguards against such activity, the report said.The administrator is now retired, the audit noted.",https://www.kcra.com/article/california-audit-finds-thousands-in-improper-state-payments/27399870,2019-05-08T04:28:00Z,KCRA-TV,Couple,"3 Television Cir, Sacramento, CA 95814, USA",CA,95814

60,Family of California man killed in Tesla crash sue automaker,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The family of a software engineer who died after his Tesla SUV crashed in a Northern California highway has sued the automaker.

The lawsuit filed in a Santa Clara County says the autopilot navigation system caused the crash on Highway 101 that killed Walter Huang near Mountain View in Silicon Valley last year.

Huang’s widow, Sevonne Huang, and his family also sued the state’s Department of Transportation for not maintaining the highway.

The California Highway Patrol said Walter Huang was traveling south in the carpool lane when the Tesla crashed against a freeway barrier. The crash caused a fire. Rescuers were able to free him, but he died later at a hospital.

The family’s attorney, B. Mark Fong, said Wednesday they are suing to help prevent “this tragedy from happening to other drivers using Tesla vehicles.”

76,Police arrest man who falsely claimed daughter was abducted,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Police have arrested a California man they say falsely claimed that his 3-year-old daughter was abducted in a carjacking, triggering an Amber Alert.

KTVU-TV reports Oakland police say the man’s Mercedes was stolen Saturday — but the child was not inside.

Investigators say the father lied about the girl’s disappearance because he thought authorities would help him recover his car faster.

The girl was actually with her mother at the time of the carjacking.

Officials say the report of a missing child caused law enforcement to expend a huge amount of resources to find her. The father could face charges including filing a false report.

His car was recovered after a police chase and the alleged carjacker was arrested.

CHP says two vehicles were racing westbound on 131st Street when one of them ran through a stop sign and hit the white Camry with the right-of-way that was heading south on Towne Avenue.

Neighbors heard the loud crash and ran out of their homes to try to help. They say the people inside a grey Infiniti SUV that crashed got into a red Sedan or Honda with the people they were racing and took off.

The young woman driving the Camry died at the scene. Paramedics transported the man in the passenger seat of the Camry to the hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Neighbors say drivers are constantly street racing and doing ""donuts"" in this area and believe there aren't enough police officers patrolling it.

FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — A man has been convicted of stabbing a volunteer counselor 26 times in an attack at a central California drug addiction center four years ago.

The Fresno Bee reported Saturday that Raymond White Jr. faces 39 years in prison when he’s sentenced June 10.

The 32-year-old was found guilty last week of multiple charges including attempted murder — along with the allegations that the crime was premeditated.

Prosecutors say White severed the 55-year-old counselor’s trachea and caused other injuries during the 2015 attack at Comprehensive Addiction Program in Fresno.

The newspaper says White previously was convicted of attempted robbery in 2010 and criminal threats in 2013.

The man, whose name was not released, fled in a car and called 911 shortly afterward to say he was involved in the shooting at Chabad of Poway, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit told reporters.

When an officer reached the man on a roadway, ""the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" Nisleit said.

San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said at a news conference that he had no details on motive. Authorities say they were reviewing copies of his social media posts.

There was no known threat after the man was detained, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship as a precaution, Nisleit said.

The shooting came exactly six months since a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue killed 11 people in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.

An off-duty Border Patrol agent inside the synagogue in the city of Poway, just over 20 miles north of San Diego, opened fire as the shooter fled but didn't hit him, Gore said.

Minoo Anvari told CNN that she's a member of Chabad of Poway and her husband was inside during the shooting. She said he called to tell her the shooter was shouting and cursing and she called the shooting ""unbelievable"" in a peaceful and tight-knit community.

""We are strong, we are united, they can't break us,"" she said.

Four people were admitted to Palomar Health Medical Center Hospital, spokesman Derryl Acosta said. The Authorities said a girl and two men were wounded.

When the officer had his narcotics detection canine run a sweep around Ruiz’s truck, the dog alerted, said Scott.

An Escondido man found in possession of more than 14 pounds of heroin when he was stopped while driving on Interstate 5 in Siskiyou County last year was sentenced last week to 10 years in prison, according to a press release from the US Department of Justice.

Ruben Ruiz Jr., 27 of Escondido, pleaded guilty to possession of heroin for distribution on June 19, 2018, said US Attorney McGregor W. Scott.

According to court documents, on February 28, 2018, a California Highway Patrol officer stopped Ruiz while he was driving northbound on I-5 near Mount Shasta in Siskiyou County. When the officer had his narcotics detection canine run a sweep around Ruiz’s truck, the dog alerted, said Scott. A subsequent search revealed more than 14 pounds of heroin.

Ruiz was on federal supervised release at the time, after having been released from federal custody for a separate narcotics offense three months earlier, Scott added.

According to the plea agreement, Ruiz said he was supposed to receive a call when he arrived in Portland Ore. with further instructions on what to do with the heroin he was transporting.

“This case was the product of an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the California Highway Patrol, and the Siskiyou Unified Major Investigations Team,” according to the press release.

150,Two Fresno men killed in weekend shootings,"Two Fresno men killed in weekend shootings Video

FRESNO, California - Fresno Police have added multiple homicide cases to their docket this weekend after shootings from Friday and Sunday killed two men. The latest one, police say, might have been an accident.

Before it became a crime scene, Fresno Police said the Sunday shooting happened at a home where friends were having a fun night. It was close to 2:30 a.m. when the shots fired call came in -- leading them to 1800 E. Jensen Ave.

There responding officers found Irie Tucker, 20, and transported him to Community Regional Medical Center. He died there from his injuries.

During the investigation, police determined Savon Lollie, 21, was taking part in ""reckless gun play"" at the gathering he and Tucker were. Lollie ended up firing off a single round.

He's now sitting in the Fresno County Jail facing murder charges. Police say he's been fully cooperative with the investigation.

Tucker leaves behind a fiancée and an 8-month old daughter. The rest of his family also heartbroken, gathering Sunday night for a memorial.

Anthony Sanchez, 22, was the victim in Friday night's shooting. It happened around 11 p.m. on the 1700 block of 2nd St., where Sanchez was hanging out with another person.

Police say a car pulled up in front of them and three men exited the car, one of them armed with a sawed-off shotgun. After words were exchanged, the armed suspect fired at Sanchez, who was shot in the back.

Sanchez died shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday morning at CRMC.

The suspect in Sanchez's death is still on-the-loose. He's described as a Hispanic man with tattoos on his arms, wearing a black t-shirt.

154,51-year-old man killed after car veers off Highway 4 in Hercules,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

HERCULES (KRON) - A 51-year-old Richmond man died early Saturday morning after his vehicle veered off Highway 4 in Hercules.

The crash happened around 2:01 a.m. on westbound Highway 4, just east of the Willow Avenue exit, according to California Highway Patrol.

It was determined that the victim's silver Ford Taurus diverted off the roadway, into a metal guard rail, and then into a large metal utility pole.

The Ford overturned onto the grassy embankment just off of the roadway which started a small fire.

Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze, but the driver was trapped in the driver seat of the Ford.

Authorities say he was conscious at that time but suffered major injuries.

He was extricated and transported by helicopter to John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek where he later died from his injuries.

No other occupants were inside the vehicle.

The Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Coroners Office will release the man's identity.

It is unknown at this time whether alcohol or drugs are a factor in the crash as it is still under investigation.

177,'Realistic looking' Glock used as threat in front of Visalia kids,"An argument between two men turned violent after Visalia police say one man pulled a fake gun and threatened to open gunfire.

Around 3 p.m. on Saturday, officers were called to a home in the 200 block of Northeast Fourth Avenue, near Lincoln Oval Park. Witnesses said a man was armed with a gun.

In January, police were called to a home in the same area when Abiel Rios, 33, shot his brother in the leg. The two-hour standoff, in which a peaceful resolution was sought, ended when Rios was shot and killed by police officers.

On Saturday, officers were back.

Two men were arguing when things escalated. Children were home when the argument erupted, police said.

One of the people involved was Alejandro Rios, 35.

Police didn't say what sparked the argument or if Alejandro Rios knew the alleged victim. It's believed Alejandro is related to Abiel, who died in the officer-involved shooting.

According to witnesses, during the argument, Carlos Cisneros, 26, grabbed a fake gun from a black Chevrolet Camaro parked in front of the home. Cisneros handed what appeared to be a 9 mm handgun to Alejandro Rios, who then pointed it at the alleged victim and threatened to ""shoot him with it,"" Sgt. Chris Jennings said.

Before police arrived, Alejandro Rios and Cisneros fled the home in the sports car. They took several of Alejandro Rios' children with them, police said.

Patrol officers searched the area and spotted the Camaro near Turner Street and Ferguson Avenue.

A traffic stop was made.

Alejandro Rios ran into a nearby house but was later arrested. Cisneros was also arrested.

A ""realistic looking,"" replica Glock 9mm handgun was found at the scene, Jennings said.

Both suspects were booked into Tulare County Pretrial Facility on suspicion of criminal threats, assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy, resisting arrest, and child endangerment.

Alejandro Rios' bail was set at $100,000. Cisneros' booking information was unavailable.

No injuries were reported. It's unclear if child protective services was called to take custody of the children.

If anyone has information on the incident, call Visalia Police Department at 734-8117.

178,Man hanging out car window shooting at police during wild police chase,"Man hanging out car window shooting at police during wild police chase Video

Downey, California - (CBSLA) – The pursuit of a murder suspect in the Commerce area led to a gun battle where the man was shot multiple times, authorities said.

The chase ended in a standoff Friday afternoon with the female driver also shot and wounded. Authorities said the woman was expected to be okay. The male suspect, believed to have killed a liquor store owner on Tuesday, was on the operating table for hours.

The pursuit ended in Vernon.

The female driver, identified by neighbors as Alison Hart, was taken into custody.

After a standoff that lasted more than an hour, officials said the suspect was being hooked up to an IV.

Stu Mundel reporting in SKY9 said after police fired a flashbang canister into the vehicle there was no movement. Officers and SWAT personnel kept their guns drawn as they tried to determine whether the suspect was alive. Initially, they were sure he was dead as they did not observe movement in the car for some time.

After another half hour, and allegedly after sending a K-9 officer into the vehicle, paramedics on scene decided the suspect was alive but in a weakened state. He was transported to a nearby hospital. According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, he was still in critical condition as of Saturday morning.

A robotic officer had also been sent to approach the vehicle.

During the chase, authorities said they believed the suspect was the man wanted in a murder of a liquor store owner in Downey on Tuesday.

Friday evening, police confirmed the suspect in the shootout was indeed the man wanted for killing the Downey store owner.

At a press conference Friday evening, authorities did not say how Hart and the male suspect were related. They did say they were working together.

Downey police were looking for a murder suspect and believed they found the man outside a home in Maywood. Police said the suspect jumped into a black Prius with the woman driving and the chase began.

Authorities reported the man was shot “multiple” times and was in surgery. Hart, they said, was also shot. Both face multiple charges including attempted murder and assault on an officer.

Redding police are investigating the ""suspicious"" death of a woman whose body a relative found Friday on an island in the Sacramento River, officers said.

Police said a relative of the woman reported finding her body on the island near Girvan Road at 5:12 p.m.

Cpl. Rob Peterson with the Redding Police Department said there was a homeless encampment on the island, but officers haven't confirmed whether the woman was staying there.

The relative, a man, was interviewed and released. Peterson said he couldn't reveal the man's relationship to the woman.

The island is hard to access, to the point that officers used a helicopter to find the body, they said. Peterson said it's very unusual to find an encampment on one of the islands in the river.

""It's strange back in there,"" he said. ""This entire investigation was just very unique, with the encampment that was on the island.""

Police haven't determined the cause of the woman's death, they said. Peterson said her autopsy should be in the next few days.

Officers said they aren't releasing her identity yet.

Anyone with information on this incident is asked to call the Redding Police Department at 530-225-4200.

206,Fresno Sheriff: 31-year-old man dies in custody after attacking a man and his dog,"FRESNO COUNTY, California - A 31-year-old man died while in the custody of deputies with the Fresno County Sheriff's Office Thursday.

It all began on May 9 just before 3 p.m. when a home's security alarm began sounding, and the homeowner was not able to check on his home. He checked security cameras and noticed a man he wasn't familiar with.

Deputies headed to the home in the 5400 block of East Balch Avenue. While en route, a neighbor and retired police officer was listening to a police scanner inside his home, look out and saw the man who matched the suspect's description.

That's when he called dispatch and reported where he saw the suspect. He then went outside and followed the suspect. ""Once they got close, the suspect turned around and attacked the man

and his dog,"" the sheriff's office said.

Deputies arrived shortly thereafter and took the suspect into custody. EMS was called to the scene to treat the suspect for minor injuries, which included dog bites.

""While getting medical attention, the man went unconscious and began to experience cardiac issues. Paramedics performed CPR and transported him to Community Regional Medical Center, where he later died,"" the sheriff's office said in a news release.

The suspect has been identified as 31-year-old Lorenzo Neal of Fresno. He is not related to the former NFL player.

An autopsy has been performed on Neal and his cause of death is pending the results of toxicology tests.

Sheriff’s homicide detectives are handling this in-custody death investigation.

208,Man injured in Fullerton explosion,"- A 59-year-old man was seriously injured today in an explosion on Harbor Boulevard that led to the evacuation of area businesses and shutdown of the thoroughfare.

Police were called to the 1100 block of South Harbor Boulevard at 8:50 a.m. for what was initially thought to be an electrical box explosion, Fullerton police Lt. Jon Radus said.

When officers arrived, they found the unidentified man with serious injuries to his hands and face, Radus said. He said the man was hospitalized but was expected to survive his injuries, which reportedly include missing fingers.

The Orange County sheriff's bomb squad was sent to the scene to determine what exploded, Radus said. Investigators later found another Improvised Explosive Device and ""rendered it safe,"" police said.

Fullerton detectives expect to pursue charges against the 59-year-old man, police said.

The blast happened in a parking lot so there was no damage to buildings or any other injuries, according to Radus, who said police evacuated area businesses as a precaution.

Harbor Boulevard was shut down from Orangethorpe to Southgate avenues, but was later reopened.

212,Gunman told 911 ‘I just shot up a synagogue’ after attack in Poway near San Diego,"SAN DIEGO – As the 19-year-old college student sped away in his 2012 Honda Civic, he dialed 911 and said: “I just shot up a synagogue.”

He told the dispatcher that he thought he had killed some people and that he did it “because Jewish people are destroying the white race.”

The chilling account in a federal affidavit unsealed Thursday was the most detailed yet of a gunman’s attack on a Southern California synagogue that killed a woman and wounded three others during Passover service last month in the San Diego suburb of Poway.

It describes a deeply disturbed man filled with hatred who claimed to be inspired by the attacks on the mosques in New Zealand and the shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue last fall.

The Department of Justice filed 109 hate crime and other charges against the suspect, John T. Earnest, who could face the death penalty. The federal charges include murder for the killing of 60-year-old Lori Kaye, who was hit twice as she prayed in the foyer of the synagogue. It also includes charges for the attempted murder of 53 others.

In a court appearance last month, Earnest pleaded not guilty to state charges of murder and attempted murder and in a separate case to an arson charge tied to a mosque fire.

During the 911 call, Earnest said he killed because he was “trying to defend my nation from the Jewish people … They’re destroying our people,” according to the affidavit.

He then told the dispatcher where he was at, that he would surrender to authorities and leave his semi-automatic rifle in the car. He also said he was wearing a chest rig with additional ammunition, which the dispatcher asked him to remove.

John T. Earnest stands at his arraignment hearing in San Diego County Superior Court on April 30, 2019 in San Diego, California. Earnest is facing charges of murder and attempted murder at the Chabad of Poway synagogue, where one woman was killed and three injured. On Thursday, May 9, he was charged with 109 federal counts of hate crimes. (Photo: Pool, Getty Images)

Shortly after that, police arrested Earnest.

Police would later learn it was not the first attack on a house of worship by the suspect, according to the affidavit.

The nursing student and gifted pianist had tried weeks earlier to burn down a nearby mosque in Escondido, where seven people on a spiritual retreat were sleeping, according to the affidavit. They awoke to flames licking at the door and managed to extinguish the fire, which charred a wall.

Outside the mosque, the suspect had scrawled the name of the man accused of carrying out shootings at two mosques in New Zealand that killed 50 people.

In his online postings, Earnest said he was inspired by those attacks and the one last fall on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, and boasted about how “easy” it is to burn down or shoot up a mosque, synagogue, immigration center, or “traitorous” politicians, according to court documents.

A month after his failed attempt to burn down the mosque, authorities say, Earnest bought an AR-15 rifle from a licensed dealer in San Diego.

The next day, a Saturday, marked the last day of Passover, a major Jewish holiday.

Just as the service was getting started, Earnest pulled up to the synagogue in his Honda Civic and walked in firing his AR-15, which was fully loaded with a 10-round magazine.

Kaye fell to the ground. Then Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, who was leading the service, was shot as he rushed to get the children out, including his own grandchildren.

CLOSE Federal officials announced Thursday that they have filed 109 hate crime charges against the man suspected of opening fire in a Southern California synagogue. (May 9) AP, AP

Also hit by shrapnel were an 8-year-old girl and her uncle.

The shooter emptied his magazine and stopped as he struggled to reload it, according to the affidavit. That’s when several members of the congregation, including an off-duty Border Patrol agent, chased Earnest from the synagogue.

His family has said they will not pay for his defense and that he represents none of the values they taught him and are stunned at his embrace of white supremacy.

Authorities said Earnest frequented dark corners of the web that often post extremist, racist and violent views. In his online postings, he said, “As an individual, I can only kill so many Jews.”

The Chabad of Poway applauded the federal charges Thursday but said more must be done to prevent people from being led astray by such hatred.

“We are grateful to our country’s dedicated law enforcement authorities for taking the appropriate measures to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its citizens,” the synagogue said in a statement. “As a society we must surely focus on the preventive measure of instilling in our youth a sense of personal accountability to a Higher Being, in whose image every human being was created.”

237,Man found transporting heroin sentenced to 10 years,"Ruben Ruiz Jr., 27 of Escondido, pleaded guilty to possession of heroin for distribution on June 19, 2018, said US Attorney McGregor W. Scott.

An Escondido man found in possession of more than 14 pounds of heroin when he was stopped while driving on Interstate 5 in Siskiyou County last year was sentenced last week to 10 years in prison, according to a press release from the US Department of Justice.

Ruben Ruiz Jr., 27 of Escondido, pleaded guilty to possession of heroin for distribution on June 19, 2018, said US Attorney McGregor W. Scott.

According to court documents, on February 28, 2018, a California Highway Patrol officer stopped Ruiz while he was driving northbound on I-5 near Mount Shasta in Siskiyou County. When the officer had his narcotics detection canine run a sweep around Ruiz’s truck, the dog alerted, said Scott. A subsequent search revealed more than 14 pounds of heroin.

Ruiz was on federal supervised release at the time, after having been released from federal custody for a separate narcotics offense three months earlier, Scott added.

According to the plea agreement, Ruiz said he was supposed to receive a call when he arrived in Portland Ore. with further instructions on what to do with the heroin he was transporting.

“This case was the product of an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the California Highway Patrol, and the Siskiyou Unified Major Investigations Team,” according to the press release.

242,Jewish community will ‘stand tall' after synagogue shooting in Southern California,"Getty Images Getty Images

- Eight-year-old Noya Dahan had finished praying and gone to play with other children at her Southern California synagogue when gunshots rang out. Her uncle grabbed her and the other children, leading them outside to safety as her leg bled from a shrapnel wound.

“I was scared, really, really scared,” said Noya, recalling how the group of children cried out of fear after a gunman entered Chabad of Poway on Saturday morning and opened fire. “I didn’t see my dad. I thought he was dead.”

The onslaught on the last day of Passover, a Jewish holiday celebrating freedom, wounded Dahan, her uncle Almog Peretz and the congregation’s rabbi. The attack killed beloved congregant Lori Kaye, 60.

Authorities said the 19-year-old gunman opened fire as about 100 people were worshipping exactly six months after a mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue.

Rabbi Yishoel Goldstein said he was preparing for a service and heard a loud sound, turned around and a saw a young man wearing sunglasses standing in front of him with a rifle.

“I couldn’t see his eyes. I couldn’t see his soul,” Goldstein said. He raised his hands and lost one of his fingers in the shooting.

And then, Goldstein said, “miraculously the gun jammed.”

In the moments that followed, Goldstein said he wrapped his bloodied hand in a prayer shawl and addressed congregants gathered outside the building, vowing to stay strong in the face of the deadly attack targeting his community.

“We are a Jewish nation that will stand tall. We will not let anyone take us down. Terrorism like this will not take us down,” Goldstein recalled telling the community.

Authorities said suspect John T. Earnest, who had no previous contact with law enforcement, may face a hate crime charge in addition to homicide charges when he’s arraigned later this week. He was being held without bail, and it was unclear if he had an attorney.

Police searched Earnest’s house and said he was also being investigated in connection with an arson attack on a mosque in nearby Escondido, California, on March 24.

There were indications an AR-type assault weapon might have malfunctioned after the gunman fired numerous rounds inside, San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said. An off-duty Border Patrol agent fired at the shooter as he fled, missing him but striking the getaway vehicle, the sheriff said.

Shortly after fleeing, Earnest called 911 to report the shooting, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said. When an officer reached him on a roadway, “the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,” he said.

Goldstein described Kaye as a pioneering founding member of the congregation and said he was heartbroken by her death. He said the attack could have harmed many more people had the shooter turned toward the sanctuary where so many were praying.

“Lori took the bullet for all of us,” the rabbi said, his hands wrapped in bandages. “She didn’t deserve to die.”

He said that Kaye’s physician husband was called to tend to a wounded worshipper and fainted when he realized it was his wife.

Friends described Kaye as giving, warm and attentive to community members on their birthdays and when they were sick. A wife and mother, she loved gardening and made delicious challah for her family and friends, said Roneet Lev, 55.

When the gunfire erupted, another worshipper, Shimon Abitbul, said he immediately placed his 2-year-old grandson on the floor and waited for a break in the shooting to grab the boy and sprint away.

Abitbul, who was visiting from Israel and staying with his daughter and her family in Southern California, said he was still coming to grips with the carnage.

“All of us are human beings,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if you are Jews or Christians or Muslims.”

Peretz, who was wounded in the leg, said he turned around after hearing gunfire and saw the shooter standing by the door. He grabbed his niece by the hand and carried out another child.

He then saw a group of children and got them running, “I tell them, ’go this way, go this way,” said Peretz, who is visiting from Israel.

Gore said authorities were reviewing Earnest’s social media posts, including what he described as a “manifesto.” There was no known threat after Earnest was arrested, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship Saturday and again on Sunday as a precaution, police said.

A person identifying himself as John Earnest posted an anti-Jewish screed online about an hour before the attack. The poster described himself as a nursing school student and praised the suspects accused of carrying out deadly attacks on mosques in New Zealand last month that killed 50 and at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, in which 11 people were killed.

“It was a hate crime, no doubt about it,” national security adviser John Bolton said on “Fox News Sunday.” He said investigators have not seen any connection between the suspect and other extremist groups.

California State University, San Marcos, confirmed that Earnest was a student who was on the dean’s list and said the school was “dismayed and disheartened” that he was suspected in “this despicable act.”

Goldstein said President Donald Trump called him to share condolences on behalf of the American people.

The White House acknowledged the call. “The President expressed his love for the Jewish people and the entire community of Poway,” Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement.

On Sunday night, hundreds of people gathered at a park for a vigil to honor the victims.

People at the community park near Chabad synagogue in Poway held candles and listened to prayer in Hebrew. Leaders asked community members to do acts of kindness to remember Kaye.

Poway Mayor Steve Vaus said he would stand with the community, and Rabbi Goldstein said seeing the crowd come together provided consolation.

“What happened to us, happened to all of us,” Goldstein said.",http://www.foxla.com/news/local-news/jewish-community-will-stand-tall-after-synagogue-shooting-in-southern-california,2019-04-29T14:14:24Z,FOX LA,Couple,"1999 S Bundy Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90025, USA",CA,90025
250,Breaking: Deputies search for 16-year-old boy who fell into Tule River,"CLOSE Water safety video from National Park Service Visalia Times-Delta

A search is underway for a 16-year-old boy who fell into the Tule River Sunday night.

Around 6:45 p.m., Tulare County sheriff's deputies were told a teenager went underwater. He was last seen in the area near Springville and Camp Nelson, around Coffee Camp.

The sheriff's dive team with the help of the drone unit are searching for the boy, said Ashley Ritchie, spokeswoman for the sheriff's department.

Sheriff Mike Boudreaux wants to remind everyone that Tulare County waterways are ""very dangerous"" right now.

""The water is extremely cold and moving incredibly fast,"" he said. ""It might look safe, but it is not. Please be careful when visiting our lakes and rivers.""

The sheriff's Swiftwater Dive Rescue Team and Search and Rescue Team have been training for a busy summer season. There were several drownings and near drowning at Tulare County waterways last year.

Deputies provided the following water safety tips:

Don't approach the river’s edge or enter white water under any circumstances. The current conditions in many Tulare County waterways are not survivable despite safety equipment, training or experience in white water.

Inner tubes or other small flotation devices are inadequate and extremely dangerous as they are easily overturned in the swift currents.

Use caution when near open waters.

Alcohol and water don’t mix. Play it safe and don’t drink and drive on the roadways or on the waterways.

Wear life jackets. On a vessel, children under 13 must wear a life jacket at all times.

Have a personal floatation device on board for each person present.

Learn to swim and teach your children to swim. Their lives depend on it.

Children should always be supervised. Do not let them out of your sight.

Have a fire extinguisher on board your boat.

Boats and personal watercraft travel in a counter-clockwise pattern on lakes.

For swimmers, wear life jackets, stay near the shore and don’t swim near boat ramps or docks.

The last thing anyone wants to face is a drowning or a collision on the waterways. Be mindful of your own and your family’s safety.

This is a developing story. Check back for details.

253,Arson suspect in Dublin arrested after crashing in 7-Eleven gas pumps,"DUBLIN (KRON) - A man suspected of setting three cars and a building on fire in Dublin was arrested Friday morning, according to authorities.

The California Highway Patrol says 34-year-old Michaelis Brown was arrested after he crashed into a 7-Eleven store gas pump in Livermore on the corner of Las Positas and South Vasco following a pursuit.

Police put out an alert after a suspicious black Toyota Camry was seen circling businesses in the area of 6400 Sierra Court in the middle of the night.

In that area, police later found three cars engulfed in flames and an exterior wall to a rental car business.

After arriving at the scene, authorities tried to pull the car over but Brown failed to stop. Officers chased the car onto westbound Interstate 580 and northbound Interstate 680.

Officials say the car reached the speed of 115 miles per hour.

The suspected car exited at Vasco Road and ended in a parking lot on Las Positas Road where it rammed into a CHP car.

The chase was called off after losing the car until a witness contacted authorities reporting that a Toyota gas crashed into the 7-Eleven gas pumps.

Brown fled the scene but CHP was able to locate him and take him into custody.

Authorities reported no injuries.

Police say the damage to the three burned cars is estimated at $200,000.

Evidence found in Brown's car is allegedly connected to the fires found.

Authorities continue to investigate the incident. Brown was arrested for the pursuit, assault with a deadly weapon and arson.

281,Couple connected with north Visalia shooting arrested,"More than a week after shots were fired in north Visalia the accused shooter is behind bars.

Along with the suspected shooter is a woman who police say was with the man at the time of the May incident.

Around 12:10 p.m. on May 2, officers were called to reports of a shooting near Sweet Avenue and Dinuba Boulevard, not far from Global Learning Charter School and numerous businesses.

Officers questioned witnesses and learned that a man, later identified as Daniel Flores, 22, got into an argument with an alleged victim.

The argument quickly escalated, detectives said.

Flores was armed with a gun and started firing at the man. The alleged victim was able to escape unharmed.

Flores got away before police arrived.

Detectives didn't say whether the man and Flores knew each other before the fight broke out and shots were fired.

With their suspect identified, police began searching for Flores.

On Thursday night, special enforcement officers spotted Flores driving in the city and made a traffic stop.

A bartender who authorities say sexually assaulted a woman he served drinks to at a Palm Springs hotel in March remained in custody on Friday surrendering the day before following issuance of an arrest warrant, according to court and jail records and police.

Alejandro Adan, 30, was booked at the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility in Banning about 3:30 p.m. Thursday, according to court records. He was subsequently charged with assault with intent to commit rape, burglary, rape of an unconscious victim and several other charges, records show.

The incident took place on March 3 at the Kimpton Rowan Hotel in downtown Palm Springs, court records show.

The mother told the police the bartender was ""friendly, flirted with the victim and asked to see them after work; however due to the victim's intoxicated state,"" the mother took her daughter back to her hotel room, according to court records.

At some point, the unidentified victim had lost her wallet, which Adan delivered back to the women's adjoining rooms later in the day, according to court documents. After taking a shower and falling asleep, the victim said her ""next memory was awakening in bed with a male lying behind her.""

Adan was interviewed by police and he allegedly admitted stealing the victim's room key and entering the room without an invitation, as well as sexually assaulting the woman, court documents show.

The suspect said that after initially going to the room to return the woman's wallet, he returned a second and third time. During the second visit, he suggested that the victim's mother and her husband attend the hotel's happy hour at the bar, according to court documents.

On his third visit, Adan said he saw the victim's mother leaving to meet her husband in the lobby. When the woman's parents came back to their room some time later, they saw their daughter ""wrapped in a towel, crying and yelling a man was in her room,"" court records show.

The parents then entered the room to find Adan ""buttoning his shorts and tightening his belt,'' according to court documents. While the mother went to contact the police, the victim's father stayed with Adan in the room.

While waiting for police, Adan allegedly told the father, ""I don't know, I totally messed up.''

Adan could face a life sentence if convicted on all charges, said Riverside County District Attorney's spokesman John Hall.

FILE - In this April 30, 2019 file photo John T. Earnest appears for his arraignment hearing in San Diego. Federal officials announced Thursday, May 9, 2019, that they have filed 109 hate crime charges against Earnest accused of opening fire in a Southern California synagogue on April 27, the last day of Passover, a major Jewish holiday. (Nelvin C. Cepeda/The San Diego Union-Tribune via AP, Pool, File)

SAN DIEGO (AP) — A gunman who killed a woman and wounded three during services at a Southern California synagogue later told a 911 dispatcher he had done it because ""the Jewish people are destroying the white race,"" prosecutors said Thursday in announcing 109 hate crime and other charges against the man.

U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer Jr. said it's possible the suspect, John T. Earnest, could face the death penalty following last month's shooting at Chabad of Poway, in a suburb north of San Diego. A decision on that will be made at a later date, Brewer said.

The new charges against Earnest, 19, also include an earlier arson at a nearby mosque.

""We will not allow our community members to be hunted in their houses of worship, where they should feel free and safe to exercise their right to practice their religion,"" Brewer said at news conference.

The federal charges include murder for the killing of 60-year-old Lori Kaye, who was hit twice as she prayed in the foyer of the synagogue. It also includes charges for the attempted murder of 53 others.

Three people were wounded, including an 8-year-old girl, her uncle and Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, who was leading a service on the last day of Passover, a major Jewish holiday.

""As a society we must surely focus on the preventive measure of instilling in our youth a sense of personal accountability to a Higher Being, in whose image every human being was created,"" Chabad of Poway said in a statement provided to The Associated Press.

In the most detailed account yet, a federal affidavit said Earnest legally bought a semi-automatic rifle from a licensed dealer in San Diego a day before the April 27 attack. He walked into the synagogue with the AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle that was fully loaded with a 10-round magazine. He wore a chest rig with five more magazines carrying a total of 50 bullets.

The shooter emptied his magazine and stopped as he struggled to reload it, according to the affidavit. That's when several members of the congregation, including an off-duty Border Patrol agent, chased Earnest from the synagogue.

After the gunman fled, he called 911 from his car and told a dispatcher what he had done, and said he thought had killed some people because ""I'm just trying to defend my nation from the Jewish people...They're destroying our people,"" according to the affidavit.

He then told the dispatcher, ""the Jewish people are destroying the white race.""

In a court appearance last month, Earnest pleaded not guilty to state charges of murder and attempted murder. In a separate case, he has pleaded not guilty to burning a mosque in nearby Escondido.

Prosecutors say Earnest had expressed his ""intent to harm Jews"" in an online posting, a copy of which was also found on his laptop.

In the same posting, he also acknowledged using gasoline to spark a blaze that charred a wall of the mosque in Escondido, authorities said. The fire started at about 3:15 a.m. when seven people on a spiritual retreat were inside the building sleeping at the time, according to investigators. They saw flames coming through the crack of one of the doors, grabbed water and quickly extinguished it.

In the posting, a man identified as Earnest said he was inspired by the attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last fall and the shooting at two mosques in New Zealand last month that killed 50 people, according to the affidavit. A copy of the web posting of the New Zealand suspect Brenton Tarrant was found on his laptop and the suspect said he wrote Tarrant's name on the parking lot of the mosque after the fire.

The suspect wrote that ""it's so easy to... get away with burning a synagogue (or mosque)"" or shoot up an immigration center or ""traitorous"" politicians.

Earnest was an accomplished student, athlete and musician whose embrace of white supremacy and anti-Semitism stunned his family and others closest to him. He lived with his parents and made the dean's list both semesters last year as a nursing student at California State University, San Marcos.

Authorities said Earnest frequented 8chan, a dark corner of the web where those disaffected by mainstream social media sites often post extremist, racist and violent views.

""I've only been lurking here for a year and half, yet what I've learned here is priceless. It's been an honor,"" he wrote.

Federal hate crime charges were also filed against the gunman who killed 11 worshippers at the Pittsburgh synagogue.

At some point, an argument occurred, police say, resulting in an officer-involved shooting. The man was treated for at least one gunshot wound at the scene before being taken to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

No officers were injured in the incident.

322,FBI got tips about threat minutes before California synagogue shooting,"- The FBI said Monday that it received tips on a threatening social media post about five minutes before a gunman burst into a Southern California synagogue and opened fire with an assault-style rifle, killing a woman and wounding a rabbi and two others.

The tips to the FBI's website and phone number included a link to the anonymous post but did not offer specific information about its author or location of the threat. The FBI said employees immediately tried to determine who wrote the post, but the shooting occurred before they could establish his identity.

""The FBI thanks the alert citizens who saw and reported the post,"" the agency said.

One of the tipsters told The Associated Press that he called the FBI tip line at 11:15 a.m. Saturday because the post linked to a manifesto that said the author was responsible for a mosque arson in the city of Escondido last month. He says he found online that had the mosque attack had happened and feared the new threat was real.

The tipster, who refused to provide his name because of security concerns, said the call with the FBI lasted four or five minutes and the shooting happened soon after. He described the FBI as quick and professional and said he doesn't know what they could have done.

The shooting happened around 11:30 a.m. Moments afterward, police arrested 19-year-old John T. Earnest of San Diego. He is being held on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.

The online manifesto written by a person identifying himself as John Earnest was an anti-Jewish screed posted about an hour before the attack. The poster described himself as a nursing school student and praised the suspects accused of carrying out attacks on mosques in New Zealand that killed 50 people last month and at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue that killed 11 on Oct. 27.

About 100 congregants were worshipping at the Chabad of Poway near San Diego on the last day of the Jewish holiday of Passover, which celebrates freedom, when the gunman killed Lori Kaye, 60. He also wounded the synagogue's rabbi, Yishoel Goldstein; Noya Dahan, 8; and her uncle Almog Peretz.

Goldstein said he was preparing for a service and heard a loud sound, turned around and a saw a young man wearing sunglasses standing in front of him with a rifle.

""I couldn't see his eyes. I couldn't see his soul,"" Goldstein said. He raised his hands and lost one of his fingers in the shooting.

And then, Goldstein said, ""miraculously the gun jammed.""

In the moments that followed, Goldstein said he wrapped his bloodied hand in a prayer shawl and addressed congregants gathered outside the building, vowing to stay strong in the face of the deadly attack targeting his community.

""We are a Jewish nation that will stand tall. We will not let anyone take us down. Terrorism like this will not take us down,"" Goldstein recalled telling the community.

Authorities said Earnest had no previous contact with law enforcement and may face a hate crime charge in addition to homicide charges when he's arraigned later this week. He was being held without bail, and it was unclear if he had an attorney.

Police searched Earnest's house and said he was also being investigated in connection with an arson attack on a mosque in nearby Escondido, California, on March 24.

There were indications an AR-type assault weapon might have malfunctioned after the gunman fired numerous rounds inside, San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said. An off-duty Border Patrol agent fired at the shooter as he fled, missing him but striking the getaway vehicle, the sheriff said.

Shortly after fleeing, Earnest called 911 to report the shooting, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said. When an officer reached him on a roadway, ""the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" he said.

Goldstein described Kaye as a pioneering founding member of the congregation and said he was heartbroken by her death. He said the attack could have harmed many more people had the shooter turned toward the sanctuary where so many were praying.

""Lori took the bullet for all of us,"" the rabbi said, his hands wrapped in bandages. ""She didn't deserve to die.""

He said that Kaye's physician husband was called to tend to a wounded worshipper and fainted when he realized it was his wife.

Friends described Kaye as giving, warm and attentive to community members on their birthdays and when they were sick. A wife and mother, she loved gardening and made delicious challah for her family and friends, said Roneet Lev, 55.

When the gunfire erupted, another worshipper, Shimon Abitbul, said he immediately placed his 2-year-old grandson on the floor and waited for a break in the shooting to grab the boy and sprint away.

Abitbul, who was visiting from Israel and staying with his daughter and her family in Southern California, said he was still coming to grips with the carnage.

""All of us are human beings,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter if you are Jews or Christians or Muslims.""

Peretz, who was wounded in the leg, said he turned around after hearing gunfire and saw the shooter standing by the door. He grabbed his niece by the hand and carried out another child.

He then saw a group of children and got them running, ""I tell them, 'go this way, go this way,"" said Peretz, who is visiting from Israel.

Gore said authorities were reviewing Earnest's social media posts, including what he described as a ""manifesto."" There was no known threat after Earnest was arrested, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship Saturday and again on Sunday as a precaution, police said.

""It was a hate crime, no doubt about it,"" national security adviser John Bolton said on ""Fox News Sunday."" He said investigators have not seen any connection between the suspect and other extremist groups.

California State University, San Marcos, confirmed that Earnest was a student who was on the dean's list and said the school was ""dismayed and disheartened"" that he was suspected in ""this despicable act.""

Goldstein said President Donald Trump called him to share condolences on behalf of the American people.

The White House acknowledged the call. ""The President expressed his love for the Jewish people and the entire community of Poway,"" Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement.

On Sunday night, hundreds of people gathered at a park for a vigil to honor the victims.

People at the community park near Chabad synagogue in Poway held candles and listened to prayer in Hebrew. Leaders asked community members to do acts of kindness to remember Kaye.

Poway Mayor Steve Vaus said he would stand with the community, and Rabbi Goldstein said seeing the crowd come together provided consolation.

""What happened to us, happened to all of us,"" Goldstein said.

328,"Buttigieg rebuts President Trump's cartoon comparison, explains how Democrats' can win swing states","- Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg is set to speak at a Human Rights Campaign dinner in Las Vegas Saturday after a west coast fundraising tour that took him through Los Angeles, Palo Alto and San Francisco.

About 1,300 people attended a grassroots fundraising event Friday at San Francisco's Regency Ballroom, paying $25 to $1,000 for a ticket to hear him speak.

Buttigieg, who was introduced by his husband Chasten, is the Democratic party's first openly gay presidential candidate, a Midwestern, military veteran and mayor of South Bend, Indiana who got a big-city welcome in San Francisco.

""I'm mindful that I'm in a city where a certain path-breaking leader said you gotta give them hope,"" said Mayor Buttigieg, paying tribute to San Francisco's gay rights icon Harvey Milk.

Buttigieg told the crowd this was an historic moment.

""The life experience of somebody from a new generation could be exactly what we need at a moment like this,"" said Buttigieg.

While he lacks experience in Washington D.C., his life experience serving as a Navy reserve intelligence officer in Afghanistan, a former Rhodes Scholar, and an openly gay married man, is what appealed to many who lined up down the block and around the corner before the event.

""He just seems very honest and that's something I find attractive,"" said Zachary Davenport of San Francisco, ""He's also gay. To me, something I never thought was possible, to think that that's possible is really amazing.""

""He's definitely my number one but honestly, I'm excited for most of them. I do like that there's a lot of diversity,"" said Emanuel Campo of San Francisco.

Buttigieg acknowledged he might seem like an unlikely candidate, but during his nearly 30 minute speech he contrasted his vision of America with the words and actions of President Trump, who has mocked Buttigieg, comparing him Friday to an old Mad magazine cartoon character.

""Alfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States,"" President Trump reportedly told reporters from Politico.

Backstage, before the San Francisco fundraiser Friday, Buttigieg smiled when asked for his response.

""So, I'll be honest, I had to Google that. I guess it's a generational thing. I didn't get the reference. It's kind of funny I guess, but he's also the President of the United States and I'm kind of surprised that he's not spending more time trying to salvage this China deal,"" said Buttigieg.

He also says he's confident Democrats can regain support in swing states that Mr. Trump won in 2016.

""I think it's important for many areas that maybe lost touch with the Democratic party to feel regarded to feel like we care about for example industrial communities where I live and rural communities,"" said Buttigieg, ""The important thing is not to veer one inch from the policies that make us Democrats, but to find a plain English vocabulary to make sure that they are as clear to voters in the industrial Midwest as they are to voters on the coasts.""

Speaking about reproductive rights, gay marriage, immigration, the climate, and his theme of ""Freedom, security and democracy,"" Buttigieg got big cheers.

""One way to make sure something's different is to put up a laid-back intellectual gay man,"" he said, ""Can I count on your help?""

Reaction ranged from diehard fans swearing support to Democrats willing to consider him as a top choice in a field of 21 candidates.

""I just think he touches a lot of different communities and different walks of life,"" said Graham Harbison of San Francisco.

""I really love Kamala Harris. I'm really intrigued and excited by Mayor Pete,"" said Roz Romney, a San Francisco Democrat who says she likes many of the candidates.

Buttigieg, who was not widely known nationally before declaring his candidacy in April, has faced questions about whether he can get support from African Americans and other minority groups.

""He's lesser known, but every time he gets in a room with an Al Sharpton or other people, he gets more exposure to those groups. I think he's a great empathetic leader,"" said Cleo Kirkland of San Francisco, ""and I think we're on the precipice of an historical moment.""

""He doesn't seem to be confrontational for effect. He's just so smart and so refreshing,"" said Deborah Fieldson, who drove several hours with three others from Sacramento to hear Buttigieg speak.

Buttigieg says he is courting high-dollar donors as well as grassroots contributions, unlike some other Democrats, in order to help get his message out.

He is expected to return to California and be among the Democratic presidential candidates speaking at the state Democratic Party convention May 31-June 2.",http://www.ktvu.com/news/buttigieg-rebuts-president-trump-s-cartoon-comparison-explains-how-democrats-can-win-swing-states,2019-05-11T07:19:06Z,KTVU,Couple,"2 Jack London Square, Oakland, CA 94607, USA",CA,94607

The mother told the police the bartender was ""friendly, flirted with the victim and asked to see them after work; however due to the victim's intoxicated state,"" the mother took her daughter back to her hotel room, according to court records.

At some point, the unidentified victim had lost her wallet, which Adan delivered back to the women's adjoining rooms later in the day, according to court documents. After taking a shower and falling asleep, the victim said her ""next memory was awakening in bed with a male lying behind her.""

Adan was interviewed by police and he allegedly admitted stealing the victim's room key and entering the room without an invitation, as well as sexually assaulting the woman, court documents showed.

The suspect said that after initially going to the room to return the woman's wallet, he returned a second and third time. During the second visit, he suggested that the victim's mother and her husband attend the hotel's happy hour at the bar, according to court documents.

On his third visit, Adan said he saw the victim's mother leaving to meet her husband in the lobby. When the woman's parents came back to their room some time later, they saw their daughter ""wrapped in a towel, crying and yelling a man was in her room,"" court records showed.

The parents then entered the room to find Adan ""buttoning his shorts and tightening his belt,'' according to court documents. While the mother went to contact the police, the victim's father stayed with Adan in the room.

While waiting for police, Adan allegedly told the father, ""I don't know, I totally messed up.''

Adan could face a life sentence if convicted on all charges, said Riverside County District Attorney's Office spokesman John Hall.

342,Ariz. man faces 8 counts in rapes 24 years ago in San Diego. He's suspected in Coachella Valley,"CLOSE Katie Pelland coordinates a team of nurses that examine sexual assault patients in the Coachella Valley. Zoe Meyers, The Desert Sun

An Arizona man linked by DNA to a half-dozen sexual assaults in Southern California over the last 24 years, including two in the Coachella Valley, was charged Tuesday with eight felonies in San Diego County.

Christopher VanBuskirk, 48, is suspected of two Coachella Valley sexual assaults that occurred in March 2002 and November 2004, according to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. He lived in the area from late 2001 to 2005. One of the suspected assaults occurred in Rancho Mirage, while the other was in Palm Desert, authorities contend.

The Goodyear, Arizona, resident has not yet been charged in Riverside County, so he will be prosecuted first in San Diego County.

VanBuskirk was in his early 20s when, San Diego police charge, he threatened his victims with a knife while sexually assaulting them four times between August and November 1995.

Vanbuskirk, a manager at a barbecue restaurant in Goodyear, faces 190 years to life if convicted for the San Diego cases, two of which occurred in the Tierrasanta neighborhood, one in Pacific Beach, and one near San Diego Mesa College, according to Deputy District Attorney Martin Doyle.

He pleaded not guilty Tuesday afternoon to four counts of forcible rape and two counts each of forcible oral copulation and forcible sexual penetration with a foreign object, and is due back in court May 16 for a readiness conference.

""In each case, the victim agreed to participate in a sex-assault examination to collect physical evidence from the assault,"" San Diego police Lt. Carole Beason said. ""The DNA evidence recovered revealed (that) the same (man) committed all four crimes, but he was unidentified.""

Vanbuskirk is also accused in two Riverside County rapes, which occurred under similar circumstances in March 2002 and November 2004.

DNA evidence linked the San Diego and Riverside county cases, but the identity of the alleged perpetrator was not established until this year, according to police.

In February, the San Diego police sex crimes unit sought help from the FBI Forensic Genetic Genealogy Team, and investigators from the two agencies were able to identify the alleged perpetrator two months later via public-access genealogical databases.

Last Monday, police detectives traveled to Arizona and coordinated with the Phoenix Police Department, Riverside County Sheriff's Office and FBI to arrest the suspect.

VanBuskirk was booked into the San Diego Central Jail on Monday, with bail set at $5 million.

363,Sister returns to Joshua Tree to find missing Canadian man; invites public to join hikes,"CLOSE Family of missing hiker continues search 4 months in Palm Springs Desert Sun

Story Highlights Paul Miller of Guelph, Ontario, hasn't been seen since July 13, 2018.

Interested hikers should meet at 6 a.m. Saturday or Sunday at the trail parking lot.

Family and friends of a Canadian hiker who went missing in Joshua Tree National Park nearly a year ago are rallying for support from area residents interested in joining search efforts this weekend.

The “Find Paul Miller” group will meet at 6 a.m. Saturday and Sunday to hike 49 Palms Oasis — the trail Miller had planned to hike on July 13, 2018.

Tagging this month “May for Miller,” hikers should meet Miller’s sister, Dawne Robinson, at the 49 Palms Oasis trail parking lot at 6 a.m. either day. For a map and directions to the park, visit www.nps.gov/jotr.

Hikers should be properly dressed for a hike and bring plenty of water and snacks.

“We want to be sure that those who come out to hike are aware of their limitations and only hike if able to handle the terrain,” said Ainsley Otten, a family friend who has been helping to organize the hikes.

This is Robinson’s second trip to Joshua Tree to hike the trail and search for clues as to what happened to her brother. With her for the weekend hikes are her husband, Dave Robinson, and two longtime friends.

“The fact that he has still not been found is baffling,” she told The Desert Sun in November. “We’re desperate for answers.”

The trail is about a 3-mile hike — 1½ miles in and out the same way — and ranked as moderate with a 300-foot elevation gain in both directions and takes two to three hours to complete.

Miller, 51, of Guelph, Ontario, was last seen about 9 a.m. July 13 when he told his wife of 26 years, Stephanie Miller, he wanted to take one more hike in the park before they left Joshua Tree to return home to Canada.

He told her he would hike the 49 Palms Oasis trail and be back at the hotel by checkout time, 11 a.m. It was the final day of an anniversary trip that started in Las Vegas.

An avid outdoorsman and experienced hiker, Miller left without his cell phone — which was not unusual, family have said.

When he didn’t return to the hotel in Twentynine Palms by 11 a.m., Stephanie Miller said she began to worry but decided to give him a little longer. At around noon, she contacted park officials and by 12:30 a search team was in place.

The car the Millers had rented in Vegas was found in the parking lot, but there have been no other traces of Miller — no footprints or empty water bottles or anything to indicate he may have fallen or run into some trouble along he way, officials have said.

Over the next several days, park officials and volunteers with Joshua Tree National Park Search and Rescue were assisted in their search by aircraft and on foot by various other agencies, including the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. Drones and dogs were also used in the search.

Total, between July 13 and Aug. 18, park Superintendent David Smith said, 20 K-9 units and more than 600 searchers put in more than 6,000 hours trying to find Miller.

He vowed from the start that, while search efforts have been scaled back, “we are not going to give up,” and teams would continue looking as part of search and rescue training hikes.

In September, access to the trail was closed while the area was searched by a helicopter using a new software system that takes high-resolution aerial photos, homing in on any anomalies.

There have been no reports that those photos offered any new information.

Anyone with information about Paul Miller or his whereabouts is asked to call the San Bernardino National Forest dispatch service at (909) 383-5651.

An Arizona man accused of carrying out a series of rapes in the city of San Diego and Riverside County beginning 24 years ago was charged Tuesday with eight felony sexual assault counts.

Christopher VanBuskirk, now 48 and living in Goodyear, Arizona, was in his early 20s when, authorities say, he threatened his victims with a knife while sexually assaulting them four times between August and November 1995, San Diego police charge.

Vanbuskirk, a manager at a barbecue restaurant in Goodyear, faces 190 years to life if convicted for the San Diego cases, two of which occurred in the Tierrasanta neighborhood, one in Pacific Beach, and one near San Diego Mesa College, according to Deputy District Attorney Martin Doyle.

He pleaded not guilty Tuesday afternoon to four counts of forcible rape and two counts each of forcible oral copulation and forcible sexual penetration with a foreign object, and is due back in court May 16 for a readiness conference.

""In each case, the victim agreed to participate in a sex-assault examination to collect physical evidence from the assault,"" San Diego police Lt. Carole Beason said. ""The DNA evidence recovered revealed (that) the same (man) committed all four crimes, but he was unidentified.""

Vanbuskirk is also accused in two Riverside County rapes, which occurred under similar circumstances in March 2002 and November 2004.

DNA evidence linked the San Diego and Riverside county cases, but the identity of the alleged perpetrator was not established until this year, according to police.

In February, the San Diego police sex crimes unit sought help from the FBI Forensic Genetic Genealogy Team, and investigators from the two agencies were able to identify the alleged perpetrator two months later via public-access genealogical databases.

Last Monday, police detectives traveled to Arizona and coordinated with the Phoenix Police Department, Riverside County Sheriff's Office and FBI to arrest the suspect.

VanBuskirk, 46, was booked into the San Diego Central Jail on Monday, with bail set at $5 million.

Visalia police scoured St. John's River Wednesday morning looking for a man in white suspenders possibly carrying a silver handgun.

The search forced a nearby high school to be placed on lockdown until the man was found.

Around 9 a.m. officers received reports of a man dressed in black, wearing white suspenders and a blue hat walking northeast along the river.

Witnesses said he was carrying a gun and headed toward Cutler Park.

Golden West High School sits southwest of the river along McAuliff Street and Houston Avenue.

Police quickly responded to the area and focused their search on the area between the school, Lovers Lane, and Cutler Park, which runs along Houston and Highway 216 going into Ivanhoe.

Students were kept indoors while police tried to find the man.

Less than 10 minutes later, Visalia police arrested Jimmy Slate, 27, in the area of the school. They later called for additional officers to help. He was questioned near Avenue 144 and McAuliff, not far from the former Visalia Pet Cemetery.

Officers didn't find a gun but said he was carrying a can of spray paint, according to Sgt. Gary Williams.

Slate was arrested on suspicion of outstanding arrest warrants.

Around 9:30 a.m. police asked Golden West administrators to remove the lockdown.

A Visalia man is back behind bars after police say they found evidence he was trying to sell dope.

The man has had several run-ins with police, all related to drug sales.

At 2:10 p.m. on Tuesday, officers stopped a vehicle in the area or Santa Fe Street and Caldwell Avenue.Police were getting reports that the driver, James McAllister, 41, was possibly driving under the influence.

McAllister is on active probation, which allows officers to search his vehicle at any time. Officers found 11 ounces of methamphetamine, a digital scale, two phones and a pay-owe dealer sheet.

Rene Gonzalez (Photo: Visalia Police Department)

While officers were questioning McAllister, his passenger, Rene Gonzalez ran from the vehicle into a nearby field.

Officers were able to catch up and arrest her.

Familiar with McAllisters modus operandi, MO, officers also searched a storage shed associated with the suspect. Inside the shed, officers found ammunition and other items related to gun crimes and the sale of drugs.

McAllister and Gonzalez were booked at the Tulare County Pretrial Facility on suspicion of having drugs for sale and transporting drugs. They may face additional charges after prosecutors review the case on Thursday.

The allegations didn't include driving under the influence.

McAllister has been arrested at least three times in the last year. More recently, he was arrested after taking police on a chase through the county.

At the time of his February trouble, McAllister was on AB109 probation and had a warrant out for his arrest, according to police.

AB109 is a California law that reduces penalties for low-level offenders and puts most of the responsibility on counties to jail non-violent criminals.

His bail is set at $75,000.

In total, The Californian garnered one first-, one second-, two third-, four fourth- and three fifth-place finishes.

""I feel fortunate to work with a staff that cares so greatly for the community we cover, and I’m really proud to see the work recognized.""

402,"Stem Cell Therapy is under the microscope, but it's helping these Clovis residents","CLOVIS, California - Promising new Stem Cell Therapy is now being offered in Clovis.

The potential seems unlimited, from restoring damaged knee cartilage, to repairing torn ligaments and much more.

For now, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is only allowing the use of Stem Cells in very narrow specific cases.

Clinics like the one in Clovis are using ' Umbilical Cord ' Stem Cells, which are donated after a mother gives birth to a baby.

Two local patients say that 'Stem Cell Therapy' has changed their lives. We also examine how the FDA is now scrutinizing possible unauthorized use of Stem Cells.

It’s Saturday morning at The Body Building in Clovis. Another shipment of umbilical cord Stem Cells packed in dry ice arrives from Biogenix. This is for a patient suffering from acute and painful neuropathy in both feet.

Using a syringe, a nurse practitioner will administer up to 40 million donated Umbilical Stem Cells, that have been screened and tested in an FDA registered laboratory.

Supporters claim these Stem Cells have the potential to reduce or eliminate pain and even restore damaged cartilage – bone, muscle, ligaments and even organs.

Some wonder if this approved by the FDA.

Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 1271, deals with Stem Cells. In layman's terms, it says the only Stem Cell therapies approved by the FDA are Stem Cells from bone marrow or cord blood – specifically to treat cancers of the blood or bone marrow.

However, there is an exception for that – if the treatment is being studied under an Investigational New Drug Application – filed with and allowed by the FDA.

Kasey Kahl is the owner of The Body Building – a clinic that also offers restorative cryotherapy, infrared saunas and chiropractic treatments.

He says the results of umbilical Stem Cell therapy is not only amazing, but safe.

“It is borderline miraculous,” Kahl said. “It's very safe. There are over half a million case studies with Biogenix themselves.""

In February, 16-year-old Buchanan sophomore J.D. Peralta was in a wrestling match in Mission Oaks.

His foot got jammed and his leg was twisted as he went down.

“I immediately felt two pops and just pain,” J.D. said.

J.D. had to be helped off the mat. His season – in fact, his high school wrestling career – seemed over.

Doctors confirmed the worst.

“I separated my ACL; like I tore my ACL and my meniscus,” J.D. said.

An orthopedic surgeon said he needed corrective surgery, but his family opted for something else.

“I actually got Stem Cells,” J.D. said. “It's been about 4 to 5 weeks, and I feeling like I'm already almost 100%""

His parents' reaction?

“They're so happy that I got Stem Cell [Therapy],” he said.

His coaches’ reaction?

""They just can't believe that it's real,” J.D. said.

At this rate, J.D. plans to be back on the wrestling mat next year – which keeps his dream of wrestling in college alive.

Another example is Brady Hole; he also had Stem Cell Therapy.

""They said I'd walk in and limp out, and I ended up walking in and getting wheelchaired out,"" Hole said.

Hole owns a concrete construction company. He's 41 years old, and has had horrible knee problems since he was 23.

He couldn't bend his knees or squat – two things he needs for his line of work.

Doctors told him he had the knee of a 70-year old man.

He endured four surgeries and two decades of pain.

“It was the norm, you know? It hurt all the time; so it was the normal deal,” Hole said.

He considered knee replacement surgery but worried about his active lifestyle and complications when he got older.

So when he heard about Stem Cell therapy, he thought, “I had nothing to lose; because I'd already done 4 surgeries, and it didn't help at all.”

He had Stem Cells injected into both knees.

So how quickly did he feel the results?

“I mean literally, the next day I could feel the difference,” he said.

We interviewed him about 4 1/2 weeks after his treatment.

“My knee wasn't popping anymore,” Hole said. “The pain went away, and it just kept slowly getting better and better and better. I swear by it. It's incredible.”

The FDA is currently in the middle of a three-year review of Stem Cell Therapy. That three period expires in November 2020 at which point many expect the FDA will tighten restrictions on Stem Cell Therapy.

In the meantime, if you're considering it now, check with the FDA and check with your doctor.

The treatment is generally not covered by health insurance.

406,"Arambula's attorney try again to dismiss the case, but judge denies the motion","Arambula's attorney try again to dismiss the case, but judge denies the motion Video

FRESNO, California - Before the fifth day of Assemblyman Dr. Joaquin Arambula's misdemeanor child abuse trial ended, his defense team tried to get the case thrown out again. The judge ruled against the motion, meaning Arambula's attorneys will begin calling their witnesses to the stand Friday morning.

Thursday's proceedings wrapped up the testimonies of Fresno Police officer Stephen Phebus and detective Ken Dodd. Arambula's attorney, Michael Aed, tried to demonstrate Phebus didn't conduct a thorough enough investigation to arrest Arambula back on the day his daughter's teacher noticed her bruise.

Phebus was the officer who interviewed Arambula's daughter at her school. On the stand, he said he didn't interview the girl's teachers, any school staff, visit the Arambula's home, or talk with Arambula's wife, Elizabeth.

Dodd was the detective who conducted follow-up interviews in the case.

After Dodd's testimony, prosecution said they had no more witnesses to call. Arambula's team then made a motion to dismiss the case on the ground there was insufficient evidence and inconsistencies in testimony.

In response, Assistant District Attorney Steve Wright referenced our sit-down interview with Arambula from December. In it, Arambula maintained he only spanked his daughter.

Wright said it shows he's being dishonest about what happened.

""He's asked about he injury: what did the police see, what did the teacher see, what did CPS see to get this ball rolling...resulting in your arrest,"" Wright said. ""He says...for lack of a better term, I don't know.""

Arambula's team argued their client wasn't informed about his daughter's injury and only asked if he had hit her.

""He said he did not, would not, and has never struck any man, woman or child,"" Aed said.

In the end, the motion was dismissed.

""The court is satisfied that there is indeed sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction of the sole count in this accusatory pleading,"" Fresno County Superior Court Judge Alvin Harrell said.

Also in his rebuttal to the motion, Wright acknowledged there were inconsistencies, but for the most part Arambula's daughter is very consistent with her story about what happened.

The trial continues Friday morning.

410,Dramatic video released of 2018 officer-involved shooting in Anaheim,"- An Anaheim police officer has been fired and a second if facing department discipline for fatally shooting a man in July 2018.

The firing comes after the Orange County District Attorney's Office released dramatic footage of the officer-involved shooting.

The DA's investigation found there was not enough evidence to criminally charge the two officers involved in the shooting, but the DA was sharply critical of their actions.

The DA's investigation determined that approximately 76 shots were fired between the two police officers, who at times, were seen in the released bodycam video shooting through the windshield of the police car.

Officer Kevin Pedersen, a probationary employee, was fired by the Anaheim Police Department, and Sean Staymates, a 10-year-veteran of the department, was put on administrative leave.

414,Court to retry teacher's lawsuit accusing PSUSD of firing him over reports of Yoder's sex abuse,"A Riverside County Court will retry the civil lawsuit of John Villani, a former special education teacher at Palm Springs Unified School District who claimed he was fired for reporting his coworker's inappropriate behavior. That coworker was convicted years after Villani's termination for sexually abusing students.

A jury originally ruled against Villani in 2018, but the judge ordered a retrial in March, based on a polling error during the last moments of the trial. Villani will face the district in court again in September.

Villani filed the original lawsuit against the district after John David Yoder, a former teacher’s aide, was found guilty in 2016 of sexually abusing his students and participating in what authorities called one of the worst child pornography rings in recent Southern California history.

Yoder worked as a special education teacher’s aide at the Center of Learning and Development, a Palm Springs Unified campus for special needs children in Desert Hot Springs, which moved in 2013 to Della Lindley Elementary, the same schools as Villani between 2011 and 2014.

Several times during the four-year period, Villani reported Yoder for what he deemed inappropriate conduct with students and for suspicious comments he made in emails to Villani.

“Nobody was listening,” Villani said. “I felt like people needed to know that this man was potentially dangerous.”

One one occasion, Villani observed the teacher’s aide whispering into a student’s ear. He said he often saw Yoder using a computer to find young boys to adopt. Villani said when he asked Yoder to stop these activities, the teacher’s aide responded, ""I want to find a beautiful boy to add to my collection.""

MORE: PSUSD sued over child molestation

On other occasions, Yoder made comments about a students’ physique. After Villani learned that one of his students had spent the night at Yoder’s home, he made a verbal report to Child Protective Services.

According to the original complaint filed against Palm Springs Unified in 2016, Villani reported Yoder’s actions to his direct supervisor and later to district officials. VIllani said none of his superiors, including former Superintendent Christine Anderson, took action.

The original complaint also said Villani’s supervisors at one point told him to stop “harassing” Yoder.

At the end of the 2013-2014 school year, Villani’s contract with the district was not renewed.

“I felt wrongfully treated and terminated because I felt my flag-raising had a lot to do with them calling me in and saying we don’t want you back anymore.

Catherine Gayer, the school district’s attorney, said Villani was a probationary employee who failed to meet expectations. According to Gayer, Mauricio Arellano, the assistant superintendent of human resources at the time, accepted Villani’s resignation “in lieu of a non-reelection.”

Gayer also said that Villani's supervisors did respond to the teacher's concerns.

""The evidence in the first trial also revealed that Villani's supervisor immediately followed up on Villani's report by calling a meeting with the paraprofessional and the mother of a child in Villani's class,"" Gayer said. She added that it was only after Yoder, a foster parent, gained custody of the child that he abused the minor.

But Villani isn't the only one to accuse the district of overlooking Yoder's abuses. In 2016, the parents of one of Yoder's victims sued the district for negligence.

A Desert Sun investigation found that Riverside County social workers had also failed to investigate Yoder after they found photos of young boys posing in their underwear on his computer.

According to Villani’s complaint, however, Arellano told Villani he ""couldn’t just let your concerns about David [Yoder] go and you would not follow your supervisor’s directions. You can resign now or we could fire you in which case you will have a bad chance of getting a job elsewhere.”

Arellano, who is currently the superintendent of Redlands Unified School District, denied these allegations.

""Such a conversation never happened. I am confident that the evidence at trial, both documents and testimony, will reveal the statement to be untrue,"" he said in an email.

After Villani left Palm Springs Unified, he moved to Idaho to work as a special education teacher. He and his family eventually returned to California, where he was hired as a special education teacher in Sacramento.

Gayer said Villani only sued Palm Springs Unified after he was unable to secure long-term employment in Idaho. Villani maintains that he never should have been forced out of Palm Springs.

“This has been really hard for my family. We should be back in Palm Springs,” he said. “I was doing a good job with those kids, and they treated me really unfairly for trying to protect some kids.”

Advertisement California prison escapes double with new community programs Share Shares Copy Link Copy

California's attempt to ease inmates back into the community is coming at a price: more prisoners, some with violent convictions, walking away before their time is up.Fifty of the state's more than 126,000 prisoners absconded last year, almost half of them from a program that allows male inmates to serve the final year of their sentences in community centers to get help with substance abuse, mental and other health issues, jobs, education, housing, family reunification and social support.While most were quickly recaptured, that's nearly double the number from 2014, the year before the ""re-entry"" initiative started.Also, while the program excludes known gang members, sex offenders and those deemed at high risk of committing violence, others with violent histories are allowed.An Associated Press review of the Corrections Department-run program, which has about 600 inmates, found some of last year's 24 walkaways were serving time for weapons offenses, including an armed attempted carjacking and injuring a spouse. Convictions for others included robberies, false imprisonment with violence and extortion using force or threat.The upswing in walkaways has victims' advocates concerned and corrections officials trying to identify factors that may be prompting inmates to leave mere months before they are set to be paroled.""Oh my gosh, that's a lot,"" Crime Victims Action Alliance executive director Christine Ward said of the overall number. ""When you're talking about second-degree robbery or felons who are desperate, what do desperate people do?""California has nearly 40 supervisors and agents who search for walkaways and escapees along with their other duties that include managing prison gangs and conducting major criminal investigations. Corrections Department spokeswoman Terri Hardy said the state spends nearly $22 million annually on that Special Service Unit and several other units that together fall under the Office of Correctional Safety, but officials couldn't break out the budget for catching fugitives.The Corrections Department ""takes the issue of walkaways very seriously,"" said agency spokeswoman Vicky Waters, and reviewed the men's re-entry program ""to identify factors that may be leading participants to walk away from the program without authorization.""That led to improvements intended to better help inmates reintegrate into society, she said. She wouldn't give specifics, but said they include more focus on participants' needs and the programs provided at re-entry centers.So-called alternative custody programs serve a dual purpose, offering rehabilitation to inmates while helping state officials follow federal court orders to reduce overcrowding in prisons. Federal judges decided a decade ago that California's prisons had become so crowded that it was preventing officials from providing inmates proper medical and mental health care.Butte, Kern and San Diego counties each have a men's re-entry center, while Los Angeles County has three.Some centers have fences intended to make sure inmates and visitors properly check in and out, but they aren't the sort of impenetrable barrier used at secure prisons, Waters said.They have security staff, but inmates sometimes cut off their GPS-linked location monitors and disappear from the facilities or while on approved outside activities.Just two female inmates in three years have ever walked away from their version of the program, which has centers in Bakersfield, Sacramento, San Diego, Santa Fe Springs and Stockton. Only one male inmate escaped from within a secure perimeter at a prison last year; he was captured the next day.Ward and Crime Victims United of California founder Harriet Salarno fear corrections officials are being too lenient in who they let into the men's re-entry program.""They are letting the people out that shouldn't be out,"" Salarno said.The programs can help reduce crime in the long run by preparing inmates for a productive role in the community, said Laura Dixon, spokeswoman for the Chief Probation Officers of California, though she agreed with the victims' advocates that proper screening is vital.She cited the Butte County facility that is jointly run with county probation officers, unlike some of the other men's re-entry programs. Just 3% of graduates have committed new crimes, she said, while two inmates walked away due to mental health or family issues.""There's going to be a certain percentage of folks that won't graduate the program or may walk away,"" Dixon said. Yet the centers can ""really reduce recidivism and give these people who are trying to re-enter our communities the support they need.""",https://www.kcra.com/article/prison-escapes-california/27284402,2019-04-26T14:12:00Z,KCRA-TV,Couple,"3 Television Cir, Sacramento, CA 95814, USA",CA,95814
427,Lambing season has good signs so far for the Coachella Valley's Peninsular bighorn sheep,"CLOSE Ewes, lambs and a ram graze at SilverRock resort . (May 25, 2016) Palm Springs Desert Sun

Traffic on local roads has been noticeably lighter of late as our seasonal residents take wing. That leaves locals to enjoy the heart of spring with its warm nights and lush flora. As evidenced by a recently robust birthrate, even our Peninsular bighorn sheep have been frisky.

Here's how it looks:

In the Northern Santa Rosa Mountains behind Palm Desert, the Bighorn Institute has counted 26 lamb births so far this spring with more on the way. To date, more than half the ewes in this herd have given birth, reflecting a healthy foraging environment and lack of disease.

Newborn lamb survival has also been surprisingly good although the upcoming summer will take its inevitable toll. With some 80 adult sheep already in this herd, a solid survival rate will push this group towards the century mark, a number not seen for many years. You never know, but all signs here are encouraging.

Valley Voice: 'State of the Sheep': Coachella Valley's Peninsular bighorn are doing all right

More: Fence to keep bighorn off La Quinta golf courses OK'd. Here's why it could cost millions more than expected

Behind Palm Springs in the San Jacinto Mountains, results have been less positive. The Institute has registered three mountain lion kills of collared sheep this past winter and it may be that other non-collared sheep were victimized as well. By itself, this is simply natural attrition, but the lambing season here is also off to a poor start.

The reasons are unclear but one factor may be more dogs accompanying hikers on local trails. Sheep are prone to stress-induced pneumonia, a leading killer of newborn lambs, and un-tethered dogs can create a lot of stress.

While other desert cities prohibit dogs on many of their trails, Palm Springs has not enacted similar rules. Fortunately, some outdoor groups are beginning to recognize the hazard and have banned dogs from their hikes. Such actions are welcome and appreciated.

Lambing has also been on the rise at La Quinta with the 119 sheep in that herd spawning at least two dozen newbies so far. Even better, sheep have not been congregating on the four La Quinta golf courses as in previous years, again reflecting better forage in the valley foothills.

Recent winters have been witness to dozens of bighorn grazing on fairway grass, oblivious to the threats of predation, ingestion of fertilizers and chemicals, water hazards, and other man-made risks. Unfortunately, we can't count on winters like the one just past to keep these sheep from re-acclimatizing. These are federally endangered animals and need to be left alone. Be aware that it is a criminal offense to feed or approach them.

And in a further bit of good news, the Coachella Valley Conservation Commission voted recently to accept and certify a final Environmental Impact Report regarding the construction of a sheep-exclusion fence in La Quinta. This clears the way for a solicitation of bids and fence construction to finally get underway. While anti-fence interests will surely continue to drag their feet, this is a significant win for our four-legged neighbors. We'll take it!

429,Public safety trainees get taste of reality,"APPLE VALLEY — A dumpster fire belches black smoke into the sky.

A woman with thickened blood on her head and a bone sticking from her leg ambles by. Sirens and the whup-whup of helicopter blades in motion fill the air, as police officers with guns drawn approach a man wielding a large stick.

It's not a scene out of a zombie apocalypse.

It’s Multi-Discipline Day at the Victor Valley College Regional Public Safety Center.

Held twice a year, Thursday’s event allows students from the college’s corrections, law enforcement, fire, and paramedic academies to practice their skills in live drills.

The scenarios were simulated, but the flames were real.

As instructors stoked a roaring blaze inside a white Ford Mustang, a fire engine rolled up. Firefighter trainees jumped out, donned breathing apparatus, and began to pull out hose.

“They’re not getting any instruction today. They’re running the calls as they would in the field,” said paramedic instructor and Apple Valley Fire Protection District firefighter Corey Fratt.

As if to support this fact, one of the Mustang’s tires exploded from the intense heat as the trainees knelt just feet away waiting for water to reach their nozzle.

The boom caused several nearby high school students who were recording the fire on their cellphones to jump.

About 200 students from six high schools watched the trainees in action.

Brian Gattis, an 18-year-old senior at Alta Vista Innovation High School, said he wants to pursue firefighting as a potential career.

“It was pretty cool, pretty intense to watch it. That’s something that I want to do,” he said of the vehicle fire.

Local departments may welcome Gattis’ interest in firefighting.

National Public Radio reported that overtime in some California fire departments has increased steadily over recent years, partly due to understaffing and a longer fire season.

Last year’s wildfire season was the deadliest and most destructive in California’s history, according to Cal Fire data.

November’s Camp Fire topped Cal Fire’s list, destroying 18,804 structures and killed 85 people.

The trainees in VVC’s fire academy are set to graduate this Saturday.

About a block away from the burning vehicle, in an area known as Cert City, paramedic and nursing students practiced their skills on a variety of “patients.”

In one room, two future paramedics delivered a baby from a lifelike mannequin laying on a couch as an instructor wrote notes on her clipboard.

In another, crews wheeled in a man laying on a gurney. They reported the patient’s condition to the makeshift ER’s staff.

The $28 million training center opened in April 2012, according to VVC’s Director of Criminal Justice Rand Padgett, whose voice and demeanor resembles a drill sergeant’s.

The facility features an apparatus building with four bays for fire engines, a five-story fire tower with burn rooms, and an indoor shooting range for both live-fire and virtual fire training.

Parts of the center were made to resemble a city with streets, sidewalks, and traffic signs.

Padgett was on hand to supervise as a riot broke out on Willow Street and law enforcement trainees worked to quash it.

A large crowd of protestors — high school students — yelled “Justice for Jim” as they stood facing a line of “officers” wielding transparent riot shields and batons.

Most of the protestors seemed to relish launching their rocks — plastic bottles — as they caromed off the armored wave pushing them back down the street.

Padgett congratulated the groups on a successful fracas, and the trainees filed two-by-two back up Willow.

The videos cover most of the shootings by Fremont police officers since 2015 but omit both incidents when officers shot and killed unarmed people.

The department did not release video of the shooting of 16-year-old Elena Mondragon, a passenger in a fleeing vehicle who was killed by plainclothes detectives in Hayward on March 14, 2017. Nor did the

department release video of the fatal shooting of 45-year-old Nana Adomako, a homeless man who was killed in a struggle with Officer James Taylor on Feb. 5, 2017.

Geneva Bosques, a department spokeswoman, said the department withheld details about those investigations because in Adomako's case the department is still being sued. In the Mondragon case, there is a criminal case pending against the car's driver, Rico Tiger, who is charged with Mondragon's murder under the state's provocative act doctrine. The department is expecting to be sued in that case as well.

Bosques referred further questions to City Attorney Harvey Levine, who did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Most of the video released was cobbled together from video taken by the officers' dashboard cameras, surveillance video and bystander video and edited together in a narrative format.

No officer involved in the shootings activated a body-worn camera prior to using deadly force. While the Fremont Police Department started a pilot program for body-worn cameras in 2014, it did not deploy cameras to all officers until late last year.

Two officers activated their cameras after a shooting in April 2018; the shooting was recorded because the cameras continuously record and save the previous 30 seconds of footage prior to activation, but without audio.

""In almost all of these cases where we have released video, we had no body-cams issued to the officers,"" Bosques said. ""Since rolling out the cameras in November, checks are conducted regularly and there are even reminders posted on the exit doors.""

The department also released summary reports for each of the videos released Wednesday indicating that each shooting was found to be in department policy. The letters fall short of disclosure requirements under California's new police transparency law, SB 1421, but Bosques indicated that

administrative review documents were available by request.

Of the six videos released on Wednesday, in two cases the suspect was armed with a knife and apparently suffering from a mental health crisis. In the only non-fatal shooting, the suspect was swinging a pipe around, but the shooting itself was not on video.

In three cases. the suspect either fired on or pointed a gun at officers. In one case an officer was shot in the head.

The first shooting was from Jan. 16, 2015. Police were called to Sylvester P. Harvey Community Park, where a 911 caller said a man was brandishing a knife and had attacked a vendor. Dash cam video shows the officers pull up on the man, identified as Zaki Shinwary, a 48-year-old homeless man, who approached the officers while yelling and holding something in his pocket. After he walked out of the camera view, the officers shot him.

A second shooting of a man with a knife happened later that year, on July 20, 2015. A woman called police and said her roommate had threatened her with a knife, threatened his wife, and threatened to kill himself. When police arrived, the man, identified as 54-year-old Troy Francis, came

outside, started walking toward the officers while pointing the knife at them, and they shot him within seconds. Francis died about a month later.

An incident on June 1, 2016, led to a sprawling manhunt for 44-year-old Gerald Villabrille, whom police said was a documented gang member who shot a police officer in the head. The officer, who was not identified, had tried to pull over Villabrille after receiving a ""be on the lookout"" alert for white rental

trucks that had not been returned. Villabrille drove away from the officer, running a red light, and pulled into an Auto Zone parking lot. The officer crashed his car into the truck to keep Villabrille from escaping.

Video indicates that the officer fired first, shattering the truck's driver's side window. Police said after the officer recovered from his head injury, he could not remember the incident at all.

Bystander video shows the officer holding Villabrille at gunpoint while he dances around near the back of the disabled truck, yelling, ""you shot me, why'd you shoot me?""

Villabrille then got back into the truck, shot the officer three times and ran away. As police swarmed the area in pursuit, Villabrille exchanged gunfire with two detectives, hitting one in the chest.

Twenty four local, state and federal law enforcement agencies responded to assist with the manhunt for Villabrille. They eventually tracked him to a house on Roberts Avenue. After a long standoff, the house caught fire. When officers finally got the fire out and went inside, Villabrille was found dead, his body charred. An autopsy determined he had shot himself.

The first moments of an incident that led to a shooting on April 9, 2017, was recorded on a body worn camera from an East Bay Regional Park District officer who was looking for a suspect in an armed robbery in Newark. A customer at a 7-Eleven flagged the officer down and said a man parked

nearby had pulled a gun on him.

The parks officer pulled behind the suspect's car. One of the occupants, later identified as 24-year-old Roger Perez, ran out and around the corner of the store.

Fremont police officers found him in a Walgreens parking lot, where he had climbed on top of a box truck. Officer Brendon Johnson exchanged gunfire with him. A short time later, officers heard another gunshot. Police later said that he had killed himself. The shooting was recorded on the

officers' dash camera.

The only non-fatal incident included in the batch was the shooting of 27-year-old Rolonte Simril on May 29, 2017. Surveillance and dash camera video show Simril waving a pipe wildly in a shopping plaza parking lot on Mowry Avenue. In the video, Officer William Gourley followed Simril off-camera, where he shot him three times. Simril survived and the district attorney's office charged him with resisting arrest and brandishing a weapon, according to police.

The most recent video the department released Wednesday was from April 5, 2018, when seven officers fired on 18-year-old Nathaniel Prasad during a wild pursuit around a gas station.

Police were searching for Prasad, who had two warrants for firearms possession and evading arrest. Officers recognized him in a Dodge Charger and tried to pull over the driver, but Prasad jumped out of the passenger door and ran.

Prasad pulled out a gun and fired on Officer Craig Perry, police said, and Perry returned fire but missed. Prasad circled the gas station and was confronted by several Fremont police officers on the other side. Six more officers fired on him, including after he'd fallen to the ground.

Of the six, only Officer Ralph Meredith and Officer Jamil Roberts activated body-worn cameras, and only after they had shot Prasad.

With the release of the video, Fremont police have now made video disclosures for most of the shootings involving Fremont officers over the last four years. But as the city has decided not to release video for shootings where there are ongoing civil and criminal actions, the most controversial shootings aren't subject to disclosure.",http://www.ktvu.com/news/fremont-police-release-edited-videos-summaries-of-six-police-shootings-on-new-transparency-portal-,2019-05-09T13:54:33Z,KTVU,Couple,"2 Jack London Square, Oakland, CA 94607, USA",CA,94607

MADERA, California - The family who lost its six-month-old dog to a violent death by a relative visiting their home may not ever get its dog back, but were gifted a new furry family member to ease the pain.

Ambrocio Hernandez, 27, is in custody after allegedly killing his family's dog on Monday because she was ""too friendly,"" according to Sgt. Mark Trukki of the Madera Police Department.

The Shepherd-Lab mix named Linda belonged to a 9-year-old family member.

Those home during the attack say Hernandez was acting erratically, and police believe he was on meth.

Two days after the death of Linda, Madera PD shared that the family was gifted a new furry family member by the Madera County Animal Shelter.

""While the new puppy can never replace the dog which they lost, we hope this new addition brings them happiness for years to come,"" read a post from the department Wednesday.

Hernandez is facing charges for animal cruelty and drug possession.

434,A black man claims ownership of a Neo-Nazi group,"- He's a black civil rights leader and the leader of a Neo Nazi group. Seems improbable? Even impossible? Meet the Moreno Valley man who says, he outsmarted the national socialist movement. A story you'll see only on FOX 11.

Charlottesville, 2017.

The National Socialist Movement was there along with other white nationalist and Neo-Nazi groups.

Video from the NSM’s website shows members clad in helmets and carrying confederate flags and swastikas.

The NSM claims to be the largest and most active white supremacy group in the U.S. established in Michigan in 1994.

Continue reading below

For more than 20 years, the group's leader was Jeff Schoep, right there in the thick of the action.

Also on the NSM website, Jeff Schoep saying, “History has proven to us time and again, it's through the streets, through activism, through fighting in the public. These are the things that will bring us to power.“

Now meet James Hart Stern.

He sure doesn't look or sound like a man that could head up a Neo-Nazi group. He says, “I believe there's only one race.. That's the human race.”

But he has the documents to prove he is the president and director of the National Socialist Movement.

A black man heading up a Neo-Nazi party? How did this happen?

Stern says he outsmarted Schoep.

Schoep says he was mislead.

Stern became acquainted with Schoep when he says, Schoep called him in 2014. Stern says, “We knew from the beginning we were ying and yang.”

Stern had spent some prison time with edgar ray killen, the reputed kkk member and former grand wizard.

Stern claims, Schoep wanted to buy something stern owns...Killen's prison I.D. Card

“He said, the card means power to me,”stern recalls him saying.

Both say, the two formed an on again off again relationship that included enough dialogue, Schoep changed the group's logo from a swastika to the less objectionable othala rune.

""He did that because he wanted to turn the organization into a mini NAACP. He wanted to have an organization for white people rights.”

Now back to Charlottesville, when 32-year-old Heather Heyer was mowed down by a Neo-Nazi sympathizer.

Not long after ten njured survivors sued key people from that united the right rally, including Jeff Schoep and his group, NSM.

He told Stern, “They're trying to take my house, my income, everything I have.”

Stern’s response to him, “okay, I told him, I can understand you no wanting that to happen, but at the end of the day, it's true.”

Stern told Schoep he had an idea. “I said, tell you what sign it over to me. I'll put it on the shelf and let nobody use it.”

Late January, Schoep signed a notarized affidavit naming James Hart Stern President of the National Socialist Movement.

And then in February, he signed another one, which reads in part, I have turned both the National Socialst Movement and the domain website nsm88.org to him.

Jeff Schoep refused my request for a formal interview multiple times. I did talk to him briefly on the phone. He told me he believes signing over the group to Stern would relieve hiim of legal liability in the Charlottsville lawsuit. He then pointed out his name is misspelled twice on the February affidavit.

On the NSM website, Schoep wrote stern ""Fraudulently manipulated me.”

That's a different story than what happened in a court proceeding in Charlottesville, March first.

The judge recognized Stern as NSM's president with no recorded objection from Schoep.

Schoep represented himself in that proceeding. Now, through his new attorney, Schoep says, the transfers to Stern were invalid and is preparing to mount a legal challenge to Stern’s asserted rights of NSM.

Schoep's attorney has sent a cease and desist letter to stern and shared it with us.

A letter stern insists he hasn't received.

Chances are, Schoep would say the same about this. The Riverside Superior Court granted Stern a restraining order against Schoep.

And the Michigan attorney general has launched a hate crimes investigation after Schoep changed the officers for the NSM and removed Stern from the group.

437,DNA evidence help's ID man accused of violently sexually assaulting minor on Santa Ana park bench,"- DNA evidence has allowed authorities to identify the suspect allegedly behind a violent sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl at a park in Santa Ana, officials said on Wednesday.

Authorities said that DNA evidence led them to identify the suspect as Cornelio Chairez-Velasquez, 37. Investigators said the assault happened after midnight on November 24, 2018.

At the time of the attack, investigators said that the 14-year-old female victim sat on a bench at Cabrillo Park when the suspect sat next to her. The suspect made small talk, which made the victim uncomfortable. As the victim attempted to walk away, the suspect brandished a knife and ordered her back to the bench. Police said that the suspect used physical force and verbal threats to keep the victim on the bench and proceeded to sexually assault her. The victim sustained multiple visible injuries from the assault, according to Santa Ana Police.

Chairez-Velasquez has been in custody since he attacked a woman at a Santa Ana motel in January of 2019. In this case, Chairez-Velasquez attempted to sexually assault a woman before strangling her. Santa Ana Police were called to the scene and arrested Chairez-Velasquez. He was booked for attempt-murder and multiple sexual assault charges.

He was still in custody at the Orange County Jail when he was identified as the suspect in the Cabrillo Park case. Rape and child molest charges were added to his charges and he is currently being held without bail.

438,Trial date set in deadly North Salinas gang shooting in 2008,"CLOSE Officers from eight different agencies came together to form Operation Triple Beam, which targeted gangs and guns U.S. Marshals Office of Public Affairs, PROVIDED / U.S. Marshals Office of Public Affairs

A trial date has been set for a man arrested on suspicion of a deadly gang shooting at a Salinas apartment complex more than ten years ago.

Juan Antonio Cervantes, 31, is set to stand trial in December on accusations he opened fire on three people, hitting two of them, in the 2100 block of Perez Street on Sept. 2, 2008, Judge Andrew Liu ruled Friday.

One of the victims, Adrian Carranza, 24, died days later at a Santa Clara County hospital. Police have testified that while the shooting was gang-motivated, Carranza was not a gang member.

The other victim, who is only identified as ""John Doe,"" survived being shot in his arm, ankle and abdomen, police have said.

Juan Antonio Cervantes (Photo: Provided/MCSO)

Police arrested Cervantes July 30, 2017, after officers spotted him at a restaurant/bar in Oldtown, officers have said.

At his preliminary hearing last year, Salinas police testified that Cervantes was a Sureño gang member who opened fire on Carranza, a victim identified only as John Doe and another person.

Cervantes allegedly shot at the trio about an hour-and-a-half after the fatal shooting of a Sureño who was a close relative of Cervantes.

Salinas police Det. Derek Gibson told the court he determined John Doe was an ""active participant in the Norteño criminal street gang"" but Carranza was not affiliated with the gang.

Witnesses proved vital in eventually determining Cervantes was the suspect, retired Det. Kyle Kimm said in court.

But Cervantes' defense attorney, Charles Shivers, on Monday questioned several aspects of the prosecution's case, including its age and a key witness' conflicting statements about the number of shooters and whether she knew who the shooter was.

Salinas police have not said why Cervantes wasn't arrested on suspicion of Carranza's homicide until nine years later.

The case's prosecutor, Monterey County Deputy District Attorney Brian Jones, is out of the office this week and unavailable for comment.

Kimm had trouble recalling the details to answer Shivers' questions, though that witness feared retaliation, Kimm said.

Crime: Gang leader directed young couple to kill in June 2018 slayings, police say

Judge Andrew Liu, however, ruled he didn't see any evidence of ""deliberate evasion"" in the responses to questions about those inconsistencies.

""The court would have to find that they were intentionally feigning if they constantly do not remember,"" Liu said. ""I don't believe that was the case here.""

Shivers also asked Det. Gibson as to why witnesses told police the shooter was wearing a red-and-gray San Francisco 49ers hooded sweatshirt if he was a Sureño, who are associated with the color blue.

Gibson said he determined Cervantes' gang affiliation through evidence including his prior contacts with law enforcement — he had been arrested in the intervening years. Gibson also said Cervantes has several gang tattoos, including one that says ""Most Hated,"" the slogan of the Sureño Hebbron Street gang.

In addition, the red shirt may have been a disguise when he went to the North Salinas neighborhood, which was Norteño territory.

""I know multiple subsets (of Sureños), to include Hebbron, will in fact dress in Norteño apparel in order to get closer to rival gang members in order to commit violent crimes,"" Gibson said.

Cervantes is facing one count of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted murder, two counts of assault with a firearm and additional enhancements for gang and gun violations.

Before his trial is slated to begin Dec. 2, he is scheduled to next appear in court June 19 for a pretrial conference.

440,"Man kills family dog because it wanted to play too much, Madera Police say","MADERA, California - A Madera man was arrested Monday for beating a family dog to death with a hammer because it wanted to play too much, the Madera Police Department said.

Around 8:45 p.m., officers were dispatched to the 800 block of south D Street regarding a large pool of blood located in a family’s driveway.

When the officers arrived and contacted the residents of the property, they were informed a cousin to the family was standing near their fence line when they arrived home.

The cousin was not allowed at the property due to his extensive drug use and aggressive demeanor, police said.

After the man was told to leave the property -- which he did -- law enforcement was contacted regarding the blood found at the scene.

Officers investigated the scene and followed the blood trail to a garbage can.

Inside the garbage can they found the family dog dead.

The dog had extensive blunt force trauma. It was believed the cousin may have killed the animal, and an investigation was started to attempt to locate him.

He was identified as Ambrocio Hernandez, 27.

Officers were able to locate Hernandez and his vehicle a short time later.

Hernandez had a large amount of blood on him, mostly focused around his hands and shoes. He was also in possession of a hammer which is believed to have been the weapon used, police said.

During an interview, police say Hernandez admitted to killing the family dog, saying that it wanted to play with him too much and was bugging him.

Hernandez was found to be in possession of methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia.

The Police Department has had previous contacts with Hernandez, and on some occasions, he has been combative, police said.

441,Man fatally shot by Stockton police officer identified,"STOCKTON — Saoun Pol, 35, of Stockton was identified by police Tuesday as the man armed with a baseball bat who was shot by an officer Saturday in north Stockton. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at San Joaquin General Hospital, but police were waiting until family members could be notified before releasing that information.

According to earlier reports, officers responded about 11:30 a.m. Saturday to the West Lane area north of East Hammer Lane where a man, now identified as Pol, was armed with a bat and “acting erratically.”

Responding officers caught up with Pol on Castle Oaks Drive and Marlboro Court, where they ordered him to drop the bat. Instead, police allege Pol advanced on the officers while swinging the bat.

At that point, Officer Jorge Andrade fired his gun and struck Pol, according to police. Medics responded and transported Pol to the hospital, where it is now known he was pronounced dead that day.

Andrade, hired in July 2013, and Officer Bradley Miller, hired in December and also involved in the incident, were placed on standard three-day administrative leave. The Police Department also launched a countywide protocol investigation into the shooting with the San Joaquin County District Attorney’s Office and the California Department of Justice.

JUST GOING TO COURT CAN RACK THOUSANDS TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN FEES. EVERYTHING FROM RESTITUTION THE VICTIMS, TO THE COST OF THE COURT CLERK, EVEN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND IT DOESN’T END WHEN YOU LEAVE THE JAILHOUSE. PROBATION CAN TACK ON FEES ONCE YOU GET OUT. >> WE’RE ALREADY PAYING RESTITUTION, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WHY DO WE HAVE ALL THESE JACKED UP COURT FINES AND ALL THESE OTHER EXTRA THINGS ON TOP OF Y KNOW WHAT WE OWE THE VICTIMS I UNDERSTAND THE VICTIMS BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ON TOP OF IT IT’S LIKE EVERYONE’S TRYING TO GET SOMETHING. BRIAN: THERE ARE NEARLY TWO DOZEN FEES THAT COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS CAN CHARGE, EVERYTHING FROM PRE-SENTENCE REPORTS TO DRUG TESTING TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. >> SOMETIMES IT’S TO THE POINT WHERE IT’S SO OVERWHELMING THE AMOUNT THAT I DON’T SEE A PERSON PAYING THAT OFF AT ALL.

LOOKING AT THE 2016-2017 FISCAL YEAR AS AN EXAMPLE, THE COUNTY CHARGED PROBATIONER MORE THAN $7 MILLION IN FEES, BUT IT COLLECTED $2.5 MILLION. NOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT, BUT THE COST TO COLLECT THAT MONEY IS HIGH, TOO. WE’LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER >> IT’S SOMETHING THAT WE ASK ADULT OFFENDERS, PROBABLY RIGHTLY SO, TO PAY OTHERWISE THAT BURDEN GOES TO THE TAXPAYERS. BRIAN: KIM NAVA WITH SACRAMENTO COUNTY SAYS GETTING RID OF THOSE FEES WOULD HURT THE BUDGETS FOR PROBATION, THE SHERIFF, AND TH PUBLIC DEFENDER.

BRIAN: THOUGH MATHEW TRATTNER SAYS HE CANNOT RECALL ANYONE ASKING IF HE WAS FINANCIALLY ABLE TO PAY HIS DOLLAR AMOUNT. NOW THAT HE’S MARRIED, HE SAYS THE COUNTY CONSIDERS HER SALARY AS PART OF HIS INCOME, TOO.

BRIAN: ALAMEDA AND SAN FRANCISCO COUNTIES HAVE ELIMINATED THEIR FEES, SAYING THE EFFECT WAS MINIMAL ON THEIR BUDGETS. WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO SACRAMENTO COUNTY. REMEMBER IT COLLECTED $2 MILLION IN PROBATION FEES? IT COST THEM $1.8 MILLION TO COLLECT THOSE FEES. IN THE END IT GAINED JUST $700,000 GIVEN ALL THAT, A PUSH IS UNDERWAY IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO PUT AN END TO THIS WHOLE SYSTEM.

You've no doubt heard the line on just about every cop show on TV: ""You have the right to remain silent ... you have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided to you.""What that line does not say is that when you get out of jail, you may have to pay for that attorney and a lot more.Mathew Trattner could be called the face of second chances. As a teenager, not even old enough to drive, he killed a man.""I was in prison for second-degree murder, and I was facing 15 (years) to life,"" says Trattner. ""I went out with some people trying to impress some kids I hung around with in the street.""Trattner was taken to court, convicted and sent to juvenile detention, with probation when he was released. Now in his 20s, Trattner says he found God -- and a purpose. He knew he couldn't make up for his crime, so he wanted to give back to the community.""I was able to take the rehabilitation steps and really start doing my thing, you know? I ended up working my way to fire camp and fought fires for a year and a half,"" says Trattner.As part of that inmate crew, he helped fight Santa Barbara County's deadly Thomas Fire in December 2017. Trattner got paid for his work and used that money to help pay off his debts.Just going to court can rack up thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars, in fees. Everything from restitution to the victims to the cost of the court clerk to the public defender are fees that counties can charge. It doesn't end when you leave the jailhouse, either. Probation can tack on fees once you get out.""We're already paying restitution, you know? I mean, why do we have all these jacked up court fines and all these other extra things?"" Trattner says. He adds that he knows he cannot make up the restitution to victims and believes paying that money is important. ""I understand the victims, you know, I mean, but everything else on top of it it's like everyone's trying to get something.""There are nearly two dozen fees that county probation departments can charge, everything from pre-sentence reports to drug testing.""Sometimes it's to the point where it's so overwhelming the amount that I don't see a person paying that off at all,"" Trattner says.Since the majority of those getting out of jail tend to be low-income minority populations, the debt hurts those communities the most.Such people pay ""$3,600 for the average for the top three fees,"" says Tara Gamboa-Eastman. A policy expert, she wrote a report, tabulating all the fees charged by California counties. ""You know, most Americans can't even afford a $1,000 emergency, and these people are even more low income on average.""That report found that there is no uniform set of fees -- every county is different. ""Because you're charging these fees to people who largely can't afford them, the counties aren't collecting this money. It's largely outstanding debt that sits on the books for years and years and years,"" Gamboa-Eastman adds.In Sacramento County, the numbers seem to back her up.Looking at the 2016-17 fiscal year as an example: The county charged probationers more than $7 million in fees. They have only collected $2.5 million. That may seem like a lot, but the cost to collect that money is really high. ""It's something that we ask adult offenders, probably rightly so, to pay,"" says Kim Nava with Sacramento County. ""Otherwise, that burden goes to the taxpayers.""Nava says getting rid of those fees would hurt the budgets for Probation, the Sheriff's Office, even the Public Defender's Office. She says that the Finance Department, though, works with probationers to stay within their means. ""In some cases, if people are on general assistance or if they are unemployed or under-employed, Finance will work with them to greatly reduce those fees, and in some cases, zero them out.""Still, Trattner says he cannot recall anyone asking if he was financially able to pay his dollar amount. Now that he's married, he says the county considers his wife's salary as part of his income too. Now the county is charging him even more money each month.""Now they're wanting me to pay $300 a month, and, you know personally, I have an apartment for $930 because we're an affordable housing unit,"" says Trattner.Alameda and San Francisco counties have eliminated their probation fees, saying the effect was minimal on their budgets.That brings us back to Sacramento County. Remember, they collected $2.5 million in probation fees. Yet it cost them $1.8 million to collect them. In the end, they gained just $700,000.Given all of that, a push is underway in the state Legislature to put an end to this whole system. A bill by State Sen. Holly Mitchell that would end the probation fees is making its way through the Senate. Sacramento and other counties, however, think that eliminating the fees is a bad idea.""Sacramento County opposes (Senate Bill) 144 unless those fees are somehow replenished or recouped,"" says Nava.As for Trattner, he's now working at a car wash and trying to make ends meet. ""I learned that the rehabilitation was meant to help a person overcome their circumstances get them into a state of mind where they can actually become, you know, civilized human beings,"" says Trattner. ""To get out one day and have a job and actually live a life that is positive ... and actually be a profit to society.""But with the fees he has to pay, that profit will have to wait until his debt to society is finally paid in full.",https://www.kcra.com/article/sacramento-county-only-made-dollar700k-in-probation-fees-in-one-year/27425551,2019-05-10T02:35:00Z,KCRA-TV,Couple,"3 Television Cir, Sacramento, CA 95814, USA",CA,95814
467,Stockton PD releases ID of man shot dead by officer,"STOCKTON — Saoun Pol, 35, of Stockton was identified by police Tuesday as the man armed with a baseball bat who was shot by an officer Saturday in north Stockton. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at San Joaquin General Hospital, but police were waiting until family members could be notified before releasing that information.

According to earlier reports, officers responded about 11:30 a.m. Saturday to the West Lane area north of East Hammer Lane where a man, now identified as Pol, was armed with a bat and “acting erratically.”

Responding officers caught up with Pol on Castle Oaks Drive and Marlboro Court where they ordered him to drop the bat. Instead, police allege Pol advanced on the officers while swinging the bat.

At that point, Officer Jorge Andrade fired his gun and struck Pol, according to police. Medics responded and transported Pol to the hospital, where it is now known he was pronounced dead that day.

Andrade and Officer Bradley Miller, also involved in the incident, were placed on standard three-day administrative leave. The Police Department also launched a countywide protocol investigation into the shooting with the San Joaquin County District Attorney’s Office and the California Department of Justice.

469,Man in serious condition after stabbing near Metro Red Line Station in Westlake District,"- A man is in serious condition Monday night after being stabbed near the Metro Red Line Station in the Westlake District of Los Angeles.

The stabbing was reported shortly after 8 p.m. in the parking lot of the Red Line Station in the 600 block of S. Alvarado Street, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

LAPD says a Hispanic man was stabbed by two other Hispanic men that fled the scene before police arrived. The victim was taken to the hospital. Police have not released a description of the suspects at this time.

It's unknown what led to the attack. No further details were immediately known. The investigation is ongoing.

470,Congressman Raul Ruiz responds to medical emergency — once again — treating man with seizure,"CLOSE Rep. Raul Ruiz provides medical assistance at Veterans University event on May 4, 2019 in Rancho Mirage Courtesy of Mark Cieslikowski

Gary Young and his wife Sandra decided to go to Rep. Raul Ruiz's annual Veterans University event in Rancho Mirage hoping to learn about the benefits and resources available to Coachella Valley veterans, in case they needed them in the future.

""I thought it was a good idea for us to go because, in case something happens in the future, it'd be nice to know what our benefits were,"" Sandra said.

Little did she know that one of the benefits would be impromptu medical treatment from Ruiz himself.

Ruiz's Veterans University event provides veterans and armed services members information on the local services available to them. Moments before Ruiz was scheduled to address the audience, Young, a 75-year-old Vietnam veteran who lives in Palm Desert, collapsed from what doctors believe was a seizure. That's when the congressman leapt into action.

Ruiz first placed Young on his back to prevent additional seizures, then checked for his pulse and any joint dislocations. Finally, he tilted Young's head back and thrust his lower jaw forward — a procedure to prevent a patient's airway from being obstructed, and to ensure oxygen continues to flow to the brain.

Ruiz attended to him for about 10 minutes until paramedics arrived.

""I am grateful for everyone who helped and pray for the veteran’s health and recovery,"" Ruiz said. ""I’m just glad I’m able to use my education, my skills, and my experiences to help someone in their time of need.”

Since being elected to Congress in 2012, Ruiz has provided medical treatment in emergency situations several times. On flights between Washington D.C. and the Coachella Valley, the former emergency room physician has provided medical assistance to passengers in need on four occasions.

In 2013, he assisted a collapsed passenger sitting near him on a flight from Washington to Dallas. In 2014, he aided a conservative columnist suffering from a seizure on a flight from Washington to Palm Springs. In 2017, he provided first aid to a passenger bleeding from a finger cut and, this past March, he assisted another ailing passenger on a flight to Palm Springs.

490,CHP: Suspected DUI driver arrested for deadly HWY 4 crash,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

BRENTWOOD (KRON) - Highway 4 was closed in Brentwood on Monday evening following a deadly crash, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Officials say that a suspected drunk driver killed a man.

Around 4:34 p.m., CHP Contra Costa received reports of a head-on collision. The highway was then closed in both directions at Balfour Road.

Officers arrived to find that a 2018 Honda SUV had driven over the center lines and collided into a 2013 Toyota Corolla.

The 51-year-old man from Ripon was driving the Toyota and died on the scene.

The Contra Costa County Sheriff's Coroners Office has not released his identity at this time.

Police arrested the man driving the Honda on suspicion of felony DUI. He has been identified as a 46-year-old man from Concord.

The initial investigation shows that the Honda driver was heading westbound in the two-lane highway that does not have a center divider. That is when he veered to the left hitting the man driving eastbound in the Toyota.

CHP says the Honda driver was not injured.

The highway was fully reopened at 6:25 p.m.

Authorities are asking that those who did not stay on the scene and witnessed the crash or the events leading up to it, to contact the CHP department at (925) 646-4980.

On the CHP Facebook page, they added:

Impaired DUI driving is 100% preventable 100% of the time. There is never an excuse for it and it cannot ever be tolerated. In this situation it tragically cost the life of an innocent person. When will we all learn...#neverdriveimpaired

498,Crown Act: California woman says bill to end race-based hair discrimination is long overdue,"- When Mary Beth Haile Hofstein of Clayton, Calif. would interview for jobs, she’d pull her kinky hair back in a tight bun or spend hours straightening it to a shiny sheen.

Then, when she’d worked at a place for six months or so, the mother of four and former medical industry employee, would let it go au natural: Most often sporting a medium-sized Afro.

It was then that she said she got looks and comments from managers.

“I was greeted with some dismay,” the 51-year-old said on Wednesday. “They’d start to treat me a little differently. It’s hard to quantify. I’d just get comments like, ‘Just be careful, make sure you stay within code.’”

Hofstein isn’t alone in her natural hair experiences that she said she encountered over nearly two decades working at Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco, UCSF and when she worked at hospitals in Florida.

There have been too many anecdotes like hers to count.

But California state Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles) has been listening. She introduced SB 188, or the Crown Act, which unanimously passed 37-0 this week and is now on its way to the state assembly.

The bill updates the definition of race on the books to include “traits historically associated with race, including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles.""

The bill notes that definitions of professional workplace dress and grooming often derive from European standards and thus penalties for noncompliance disproportionately affect African Americans.

""Workplace dress code and grooming policies that prohibit natural hair, including afros, braids, twists, and locks, have a disparate impact on Black individuals as these policies are more likely to deter Black applicants and burden or punish Black employees than any other group,"" the bill states.

Speaking on the Senate floor on Monday, Mitchell added that until recently, searching Google Images for “unprofessional hairstyles” would only produce black women.

State and federal anti-discrimination laws protect women’s choice to wear religious hairstyles and head coverings, Mitchell noted.

""However, there are still far too many cases of black employees and applicants denied employment or promotion — even terminated — because of the way they choose to wear their hair,"" she told her colleagues. ""I have heard far too many reports of black children humiliated and sent home from school because their natural hair was deemed unruly or a distraction to others.""

The Crown Act comes after similar guidelines were issued in February by the New York City Commission on Human Rights, which classified discrimination or harassment based on hair or hairstyle as a form of racial discrimination.

The guidelines specifically mention the right of New Yorkers to maintain their “natural hair, treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed state.”

In practice, the guidelines give legal recourse to people who have been harassed, threatened, punished, demoted or fired because of the texture or style of their hair. The city commission can levy penalties up to $250,000 on defendants that are found in violation of the guidelines and there is no cap on damages. The commission can also force internal policy changes and rehirings at offending institutions, the New York Times noted.

The move in New York was prompted in part by investigations after complaints from workers at two Bronx businesses.

While many on social media praised the Crown Act of how they were “stared down” during an interview in San Francisco recently for her dreadlocks, others thought there are more important things that the Golden State should worry about.

Hey world! @AmericanAir practices racial discrimination against their employees! They fired me because of my dredlocs that i've been growing for over 20 years!! Please retweet and help me share my story! #naturalhair #americanairlines #mylandsend #citi #stopracism pic.twitter.com/cVGMvGIYOd — Admirals Club (@admirals_club) April 23, 2019

“Really there are more important issues and they're wasting their time on hair... Good grief,” one man wrote on Facebook.

Another man wrote: “Honestly this makes absolutely no sense if where passing laws on hairstyles really?? How about fix the roads in contra costa county (sic) how about fix the inflation on gas prices our state waste so much time on dumb shit instead of fixing real problems.”

But for Hofstein, hairstyles – and being told that yours isn’t acceptable -- can be a real problem.

“This is serious,” she said. “It’s about getting hired. If you don’t have a job, you can’t feed your family.”

Hofstein said this bill is trying to right a wrong that her generation has dealt with since the 1960s.

“There was this unspoken understanding,” she said, “that if you are of my generation you straightened your hair so your natural-ness doesn’t show.”

She lauded the younger generation for being “more audacious.”

“They won’t stand for it,” she said. “It’s about time.”

500,Saints still having fun! Xavier Prep baseball hangs on for tense quarterfinal victory,"No one said making history would be easy.

The Xavier Prep baseball team held on for dear life in the seventh inning of its quarterfinal game against Century (Santa Ana) on Friday, but when a chopper to shortstop ended the game, the Saints could exhale with a 5-4 victory and a first-ever trip to the semifinals.

Of course this was already their first-ever trip to the quarterfinals, following their first-ever trip out of the first round of the playoffs. I guess in this case making history does repeat itself.

What made this one more impressive is they could not rely on their ace Seth Mattox on the mound. Having pitched Tuesday, he was ineligible to pitch Friday. The ball went to Jordan Ruiz, and he fought and persevered and never allowed an inning to get out of hand. He gave exactly the performance the team needed.

""It wasn't perfect, it wasn't pretty, but it got the job done,""' Ruiz said. ""Me emotions are through the roof right now. I mean we've never made it past the first round and now we're in the semifinals.""

And extending the season means another game in which Mattox can be on the mound. He pitched 14 consecutive shutout innings to lift the Saints to first- and second-round wins.

""We did our job, got the ball to Seth now, got him back on the mound, that's what we love and we'll see what we do next,"" Ruiz said.

The Saints will be on the road for Tuesday's Division 5 semifinal, leaving the desert for the first time this playoffs. They will face the winner of Friday's late game between Salesian and Orange Vista.

The moment

Every run scored and every run saved throughout the game was crucial, but the bottom of the sixth and the top of the seventh had everyone sitting on the edge of their seats.

With the Saints up 4-2, Dylan Van Meeteren led off the bottom of the sixth for Xavier Prep with a long double to the left-center field fence. Mattox moved him over with a groundball to second, and then Justin Johnson knocked him in with a tough-to-handle ground ball past the drawn-in shortstop to get the always-valuable insurance.

Century, a team out of Santa Ana which entered the game 23-6 and ranked seventh in the Division 5 poll, had the top of its order up to start the seventh. Leadoff man Geraldo Hernandez laced a double to the right-center field fence and the next batter walked.

That enticed Xavier Prep coach Andrew Clark to take out starter Ruiz, who was running out of steam. He called on Dylan Van Meeteren, another sophomore just like Ruiz and Mattox. Van Meeteren hadn't pitched in a game in 34 days, but he got the first batter to fly out to center field.

The next batter hit a ground ball to the third baseman who went to second for a force out. A run scored but there were now two outs and a runner on first and the Saints holding on to a 5-3 lead. The next batter singled to put runners on first and third, and during the next at-bat, an attempted pickoff at third went into left field. The run scored and the runner on first was now at second.

Coach Clark blamed himself for that bad decision. The next batter walked, but Van Meeteren induced a chopper to shortstop Justin Johnson who handled it cleanly and threw to first for the final out. Whew! It was celebration and team picture time.

The stars

Jordan Ruiz, Xavier Prep: The Saints starter gutted out six-plus innings, yielding just three earned runs and striking out four along the way. He also reached base all four times and had an RBI at the plate.

Blake Powers, Xavier Prep: The Saints sophomore (perhaps powered by his cool last name) had two singles and was hit by a pitch. Most importantly, though, he came around to score all three times.

Dylan Van Meeteren, Xavier Prep: His double produced the crucial insurance run and he earned the save, handling a very tense atmosphere like a veteran.

Henry Lopez, Xavier Prep: Lopez had two of the game's biggest hits, a two-out RBI single in the first and a two-out RBI single in the fifth.

Robert Velazquez, Century: The Centurions starting pitcher threw well and also had two singles and scored a run at the plate.

Henry Rojas, Century: He scored twice for the Centurians after being hit by a pitch twice.

The chatter

Jordan Ruiz on the tense seventh inning: ""Our team has been calm, cool and collected all year, don't panic, just get that next out and that's what we did.""

Coach Andrew Clark: ""I'm just as excited as the kids. They work so hard for this and we're so young, only one senior on the roster, bunch of young guys putting pressure on themselves and we struggled early in the year. And just as of late, we realized it's supposed to be fun. And we've been having a lot of fun.""

Clark on Ruiz: ""He's just a grinder. Obviously a different style than Seth, but he's going to give it everything and he's just a bulldog out there. He's going to kind of mess with you. Not overpower you, but get you to miss your pitch.""

Clark on the semifinals: ""Obviously, we're going to see another great team. I know the kids have actually been begging to go on the road. I think the kids are hungry and excited and they realize this is something special. Just watching them get ready today, they were loose and having fun and that's what it's all about.""

What's next

Xavier Prep (14-13) will be on the road for the semifinals as they lost the coin flip against their opponent Salesian or Orange Vista. The game will be Tuesday, and interestingly, neither team in the game will be ranked in the top 10 of Division 5. The winner will advance to the CIF-SS championship game on Saturday, May 18 at UC Riverside.",http://rssfeeds.mydesert.com/~/601847518/0/palmsprings/home~Saints-still-having-fun-Xavier-Prep-baseball-hangs-on-for-tense-quarterfinal-victory/,2019-05-10T22:26:18Z,Desert Sun,Couple,"750 N Gene Autry Trail, Palm Springs, CA 92262, USA",CA,92262

516,CHP: Suspected DUI driver arrested for deadly HWY 4 crash,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

BRENTWOOD (KRON) - Highway 4 was closed in Brentwood on Monday evening following a deadly crash, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Officials say that a suspected drunk driver killed a man.

Around 4:34 p.m., CHP Contra Costa received reports of a head-on collision. The highway was then closed in both directions at Balfour Road.

Officers arrived to find that a 2018 Honda SUV had driven over the center lines and collided into a 2013 Toyota Corolla.

The 51-year-old man from Ripon was driving the Toyota and died on the scene.

The Contra Costa County Sheriff's Coroners Office has not released his identity at this time.

Police arrested the man driving the Honda on suspicion of felony DUI. He has been identified as a 46-year-old man from Concord.

The initial investigation shows that the Honda driver was heading westbound in the two-lane highway that does not have a center divider. That is when he veered to the left hitting the man driving eastbound in the Toyota.

CHP says the Honda driver was not injured.

The highway was fully reopened at 6:25 p.m.

Authorities are asking that those who did not stay on the scene and witnessed the crash or the events leading up to it, to contact the CHP department at (925) 646-4980.

On the CHP Facebook page, they added:

Impaired DUI driving is 100% preventable 100% of the time. There is never an excuse for it and it cannot ever be tolerated. In this situation it tragically cost the life of an innocent person. When will we all learn...#neverdriveimpaired

546,California bank robbery suspect dies in car after chase,"RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA, Calif. (AP) — Authorities say a man who may have robbed several Southern California banks has been found dead in a car after a chase.

The Orange County Sheriff’s Department says deputies responding to a robbery at the Pacific Western Bank in Dana Point began chasing a nearby pickup truck Friday afternoon but lost it.

It was spotted again about a half-hour later in Mission Viejo. Authorities say a brief chase ended with the truck smashing into a parked car in nearby Rancho Santa Margarita.

A SWAT team was called and found the driver dead. There’s no word on how he died.

Authorities say they’re trying to determine whether the man is the so-called “Leatherface Bandit,” a masked gunman who had robbed three other Orange County banks since March.

553,Tickets on sale for celebration of Bruce Fessier's 40 years at The Desert Sun,"On June 3, arts and culture reporter Bruce Fessier will write his final column.

After 40 years at The Desert Sun, he will retire with a prolific legacy, leaving an indelible mark on this paper, and the way we’ve covered arts and entertainment.

As he puts a period on his storied career, the public is invited to join in the celebration of his retirement at an open house May 28 at The Desert Sun.

The event will feature a live interview with Bruce by New York Times best-selling author and Coachella Valley local Tod Goldberg, as well as visual displays of Bruce's work and the celebrities and events he's covered, and a chance to meet the man who has seen and covered it all, from mobsters to Hollywood stars to events and festivals celebrating music, movies and desert culture.

For the past four decades, Bruce has taken Desert Sun readers inside the lives of Frank Sinatra, Sonny Bono, Bob Hope, local mobsters and the like.

He has covered every Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival – all 20. And each of the 13 Stagecoach country music festivals. He joined Bono on the founding committee for the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and has covered that event every year since it began in 1989.

He's a regular at local theater and charity events. He co-founded the Desert Theatre League in 1987.

He's also given back.

In 2013, he helped start The Desert Sun's Tachevah Music Showcase to offer local bands greater exposure and connect our valley's musicians with established industry veterans. He wanted to nurture local talent, and the event reflected a change in the Coachella Valley's art scene over the last four decades. While Hollywood A-listers and galas still highlight the season, generator parties have given rise to a more youthful, homegrown movement concentrated in the east valley.

560,Longtime Angels PR boss Tim Mead hired as Hall of Fame president,"CLOSE What I'm Hearing: Bob Nightengale on how the MLB's newest faces are making history by dominating the league before the age of 22. USA TODAY Sports

Life has its ups and downs. Its curves and snags. Wins and losses.

The Angels, the perpetually struggling team I have been involved with for more than four decades, are suffering through another not-too good, but not-too horrible season. On the field.

The same is true off the field. Ups and downs.

Last week, the notice came thundering out of Anaheim that Tim Mead, their forever employee in the public relations department, was leaving for a new job. And not just any job.

No, Mead, the one-time kid intern from Cal Poly Pomona, had been named the President of the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum!

And it couldn’t happen to a nicer guy. Mead, who has artfully navigated the media through Wally Joyner, Reggie Jackson, Jim Abbott, Rod Carew, Vladimir Guerrero, Mike Trout, Albert Pujols, Shohei Ohtani, two All-Star games, one World Series and thousands of games under the halo, is universally liked and respected by everyone in the baseball world.

Forty years ago when he was a wide-eyed 21-year-old, Tim was the low man on the PR totem pole, working for a couple of veterans, George Lederer and Tom Seeberg. Tim’s main job, it seemed, was to hand out stats in the press box. I was among the scribes in those days, thankful for the kid running around with info for the morning edition of The L.A. Times.

He worked his way up the ranks to become vice-president of public relations. He never changed – and likely will not in Cooperstown.

He is unbelievably polite. Almost all his e-mails begin with a good morning or good afternoon. His salutations with a best to the family.

“You have been the definition of kindness, humility and warmth,” said Pujols. “I have been blessed to work with you and get to call you my friend.”

Once the announcement was made, Mead’s Twitter account lit up. Former closer Huston Street summed it up simply and accurately: “One of the greatest men I’ve ever met.”

Amen to that!

At almost exactly the same time that Mead got the good news from Cooperstown, another Angel received some difficult news.

Kim Rojas, the wife of Angel broadcaster Victor Rojas, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.

Rojas, like Mead, is a popular figure in Anaheim.

He has been the TV voice of the Angels for the past 10 seasons, known for his catch phrase “Big Fly” for Angel home runs.

The son of former All-Star and Angel manager Cookie Rojas, Victor, 51, even played a season of baseball here in the Coachella Valley at College of the Desert.

When he posted his wife’s diagnosis on Facebook, he concluded with: “Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the incredibly kind words of encouragement.”

“If it’s cancer, we will take it out,” Kim said last month. “God doesn’t give you something you can’t handle. I have to keep it together. Yes, this thing is happening to my body, but I’m going to do this for my family. I’d rather something be happening to me than my kids or my husband.”

We join the chorus of fans congratulating Tim Mead and wishing a full recovery for the Rojas family.

Ups and downs.

576,Cracking the Kawhi Code,"Before he called a single play for Kawhi Leonard, before he ever coached or cajoled him or conversed with him, Nick Nurse had the same impression as anyone else of his new star player: Quiet. Reticent. Impenetrable.

That's the player the world saw and (rarely) heard all those years in San Antonio. That's the guy Nurse braced himself for last summer, after the Toronto Raptors acquired Leonard in a stunning blockbuster trade. So Nurse, the Raptors' newly installed rookie head coach, approached their first meeting with a dual strategy.

""Plan A was to have a conversation with him,"" Nurse recalled on a recent April afternoon. ""And Plan B was, if there was no conversation, I was just going to tell him my life story, basically.""

Nurse—a native of tiny Carroll, Iowa, whose coaching odyssey had taken him from Des Moines to South Dakota, to Belgium and various dots across the United Kingdom, to Oklahoma and Texas—had retold his story often while pursuing the Raptors' job. It was easy conversation filler.

""I'll just keep talking,"" Nurse told himself at the time.

But then something unexpected happened. Leonard talked. Engaged. Probed. Asked questions.

""He was smart, he was nice, he was respectful,"" Nurse recalled. ""It was easy.""

Easy. The word comes up repeatedly around this team when Leonard is the subject. Easy to coach, easy to play with, easy to befriend. And yes, easy to converse with—his comically reserved persona notwithstanding.

""He's easy guy,"" said teammate Serge Ibaka, who has become close to Leonard. ""I like easy people.""

Easy to win with, too, as the Raptors have happily learned over the past seven months, through a 58-win regular season and two rounds of the playoffs, including an incredibly taut semifinal series against the Philadelphia 76ers, now tied at 3-3. Game 7 is Sunday.

Leonard has been an absolute wrecking ball, destroying opponents with a deft blend of power and finesse, inspiring comparisons to Kobe Bryant (by Philadelphia coach Brett Brown) and Michael Jordan (by former player Kendrick Perkins).

A 37-point, 15-of-22 shooting clinic against Orlando in the first round. A 45-point, 11-rebound demolition of the Sixers in Game 1 of the semifinals. A 39-point, 14-rebound, five-assist masterpiece in Game 4. He's torched Ben Simmons and outshone Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid.

Toronto is five victories from the first Finals appearance in franchise history. A championship feels plausible. And Leonard is by far the biggest reason. He is the heart of the Raptors offense and the backbone of the defense, attacking each possession with the steadiness and predictability of a metronome.

""He play at his own pace,"" Ibaka said. ""His pace is not too fast, not too slow, in between. ... He's a superstar. And playing with a guy like him, it just makes it different. It makes it so easy in a game.""

None of which should be surprising, given Leonard's credentials as a three-time All-Star and former Finals MVP.

And yet it all still feels like a joyful revelation of sorts.

Because of what came before. Because of how he got here. Because of the glaring risks that came with acquiring the fabulously talented 27-year-old from the Spurs in July.

Jesse D. Garrabrant/Getty Images

Leonard missed 73 games last season—the result of a quadriceps injury and a testy standoff with Spurs officials over the handling of that injury. The conflict bred distrust and eventually a trade demand. Leonard, a Southern California native, hoped to land in Los Angeles. And with one season left on his contract, he had the leverage to scare off other suitors.

But Raptors general manager Masai Ujiri saw a rare opportunity to obtain a top-five player and went all in, shipping All-Star DeMar DeRozan, center Jakob Poeltl and a 2019 first-round draft pick to the Spurs for Leonard and Danny Green.

Two nagging questions loomed: Was Kawhi still Kawhi? And could the Raptors convince him to stay? That first question has been answered, emphatically. The answer to the second remains a mystery and likely will until July 1, when Leonard becomes a free agent.

Los Angeles still beckons in the form of the hyperaggressive Clippers, whose infatuation with Leonard is an open secret. The Lakers and James could come calling, too. No one pretends to know Leonard's intentions or what impact this postseason run will have on his decision.

Even Ibaka, perhaps Leonard's closest friend on the team, couldn't get a straight answer when he asked Leonard about free agency on his cooking show. (""We'll see after the season is up. I don't know,"" Leonard said.)

The past is irrelevant, the future hazy, but in this moment, all parties seem certain of this much: The marriage of Leonard and the Raptors, however long it lasts, has been seamless, brilliant—and worth the risk.

""I've always been a guy that played the game to win,"" Leonard said. ""That's what I want to do every year. That's what I put my pride in.""

Toronto, a solid-but-softish playoff team in recent years, feels legit at last. The Raptors provided Leonard a fresh start, a supportive environment, a plan to protect his body and the freedom to expand his game. And he in turn has given the franchise credibility—the sheen of a contender.

""He would never say this,"" said Steve Fisher, Leonard's coach at San Diego State, ""but there's some satisfaction that after ... almost a lost season, that he's back in very, very, very rarefied air.""

The second time Nurse sat down with Leonard, he came armed with questions instead of a personal biography. He again erred in his assumptions—and was again happy to be wrong.

The Raptors and Leonard had meshed quickly, easily, winning their first six games of the season and then running another six-game streak after a single loss in Milwaukee. Somewhere along the way, Nurse sought out Leonard to check in with him, to gauge his comfort level and his individual goals.

The mistake? Believing Leonard had individual goals.

""I kind of listed a few things that I thought he would care about personally,"" Nurse said. ""Most of those, he discarded.""

Nurse demurred on the specifics, but it's not hard to surmise what kind of personal goals an NBA coach might associate with an NBA superstar: His offensive role. Shots. Stats. Postseason honors. An MVP trophy.

Whatever was on that list, Leonard smacked it away as swiftly and forcefully as he swats away shots with those baseball-mitt hands of his.

""He said: 'I love to play. I want to be healthy, so I can play this game for a long time. And I want to win. That's all I really care about,'"" Nurse recalled. ""I found that to be pretty interesting, that he discarded all of the other kind of personal objectives and personal goals that I had kind of laid out.""

Nurse, 51, chuckled sheepishly on that last part. He's been around the game long enough to know what drives elite players—and that every star is built a little differently. In Leonard's case, maybe a lot differently.

In a league often dominated by egomaniacs and drama fiends, Leonard presents as the ultimate low-maintenance superstar—no demands, no blowups, no hectoring of teammates, no controversial proclamations (or, really, any proclamations). He dominates the game without domineering his team.

""He's very emotionless, right?"" Nurse said. ""So there's no ups and downs, really. There's no crying, and there's no screaming at each other. There's just a guy that is trying very hard to do his job, that's a job that he really loves.""

It takes time for Leonard to open up, but the Raptors have learned at least a little about what moves him: family (including a newborn son), music, food and basketball. He was both of fan and friend to Nipsey Hussle, the L.A. rapper who was gunned down in March.

Whatever drove the rift between Leonard and the Spurs, it's clearly more exception than rule.

""He's a really fuckin' good teammate, man,"" said Kyle Lowry, the longtime hub of the Raptors' lineup. ""He's a really good teammate.""

It's mostly the little things—the way Leonard carries himself, the details he points out during a timeout, his direct manner, his seriousness about the game. But it's also in subtle gestures—like inviting a teammate to share a practice court with him during a morning shootaround, even though Leonard prefers to shoot by himself (and as the franchise star, gets the privilege of his own basket).

He's not overly demonstrative or loud, but he leads all the same.

""He got a lot of fight in him,"" Lowry said. ""He's not as quiet as people think he is.""

Indeed, these days Leonard is positively outspoken, at least by his standards—another sign of his steady evolution. As an unheralded rookie in 2011, Leonard fell in line behind Spurs legends Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker. Even as he emerged as the MVP of the 2014 Finals, Leonard preferred to blend in.

With a change of scenery has come a shift in assertiveness.

""He's being more of a leader,"" says Green, who has played with Leonard since his Spurs debut. ""I would say in the other organization, we had older guys. He didn't have to lead as much. It was more by example. But here, more vocal.""

The same is true of Leonard's game. It's largely the same as it was in San Antonio—just bolder. He attempted a career-high 18.8 field goals per game in the regular season, a mark that ranked just 11th in the NBA, while still maintaining his efficiency. He's taken advantage of more isolation opportunities afforded by Nurse's offense and used them to great effect, averaging a career-best 26.6 points in the regular season.

""I'm impressed with sometimes how easy he can make getting 33 points look,"" Nurse said. ""Stress-free 30 is a hell of a talent.""

Leonard worked regularly this season with assistant coach Phil Handy, focusing on footwork, ball-handling and shooting off-the-dribble three-pointers, all in an effort to expand his game and take advantage of the greater latitude provided by Nurse.

""We have a lot of freedom here to be able to do things you want to do on the floor,"" Leonard said. ""The biggest thing that I feel like I experienced this year is just learning about my game a little bit more with the more freedom that they have.""

So yes, after all the weirdness and tension of last season, after all the games missed and concerns for his health, Kawhi is indeed still Kawhi. Maybe better.

While everyone was fretting and speculating last summer—about Leonard's health, his game, his mood, his mental makeup, his culpability in the Spurs rift, his willingness to play in Toronto, his winter-coat supply—Leonard was quietly, methodically reconstructing his game.

The days began as early as 6:30 a.m. at the Jeff Jacobs JAM Center, the practice court at San Diego State, where Leonard still trains every offseason. Fisher, the former Aztecs head coach, recalls the routine vividly.

""He'd come in, and he would do some dribbling and ball-handling,"" Fisher said. ""But then he would start with form shooting, right under the basket, gradually work out. Then he would work on back-to-the-basket moves, precise, exactly what he wanted to do, with the up-and-under, with the turnaround. He developed a low-post game that he knew he could put to use. And then he would do the things that he does—off-the-dribble pull-up, coming off of a downscreen, a curl, a catch-and-shoot, drive. All the things that he would need to work on.""

What Fisher sees now, in these playoffs, is a fully actualized Leonard—as good or better than the player who made a run at NBA MVP two years ago. That was precisely the goal when Leonard returned to campus last summer to work with Randy Shelton, his personal trainer and San Diego State's strength and conditioning coach.

David Dow/Getty Images

""His mindset was not just to get back to the level of play of where he was but to exceed it,"" Shelton said. ""I told everyone, 'Kawhi is going to be a better basketball player once he gets back on the court.'""

And now? Now Leonard is drawing nightly comparisons to NBA legends and terrorizing one of the most star-studded lineups in these playoffs. He's averaging an astounding 33.7 points, 10.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists against the Sixers while making nearly 57 percent of his shots (36.1 percent from three).

All of it has left Leonard dueling with Kevin Durant for the fictional role of ""best player in the world,"" as deemed by NBA pundits (a discussion that necessarily leaves out, for now, the playoff-absent LeBron James).

The Raptors did their part by working with Leonard to develop the so-called ""load management"" program—which called for him to sit out designated games throughout the season to protect his body in this first season back from injury. He missed 22 games in all.

""It's not about me feeling tired or not playing this next game because I'm tired,"" Leonard said. ""It's to get me to my full potential, 100 percent healthy. That's everybody's goal. That's good. That's what you want from a team. You want them to care about you, your body, and want you to be healthy.""

The plan—described as a collaboration between Leonard and Alex McKechnie, the Raptors' highly regarded director of sports science—drew criticism in some quarters. It's rare for a team to willingly shut down its franchise star for a quarter of the season. But the results are unassailable. Leonard has never looked better.

The payoff is evident nightly now, in these playoffs. It could pay further dividends down the road. As a rival team executive said last winter, while explaining why he thought Leonard would ultimately stay in Toronto, ""McKechnie is going to make Kawhi feel better than he's ever felt.""

For his part, Leonard will confirm this much in his uniquely understated way: He feels good, great even. ""MVP level?"" he's asked. He won't go there yet. There's another summer of training ahead, this time with his body at full strength. But right now, there are games to play, opponents to wreck, a championship to chase.

""I'm just trying to win,"" Leonard said. ""That's going to be the cure for everything. I don't care if you win MVP. I want to win a championship. That's my focus every year.""

The speculation about his game, his future, the ramifications for this Raptors team and the rest of the NBA won't stop anytime soon, but he has no time or use for the drama. Kawhi Leonard is easy people, after all.

584,'Buffy' actor charged in 2017 Palm Springs assault involving girlfriend,"CLOSE 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' actor Nicholas Brendon was arrested in Tallahassee on Friday after police say he caused as much as $1,000 in damage to his hotel room. While speaking about the arrest, he revealed secrets from his troubled past. VPC

A felony count of domestic violence has been filed against an actor best known for playing Xander Harris in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""

The charge against Nicholas Brendon, 48, stems from an October 2017 incident involving a girlfriend at a Palm Springs hotel on East Palm Canyon Drive.

Palm Springs police had reported Brendon was with his girlfriend when they got into an argument and he pulled her arm and then pulled her by her hair.

Hotel employees notified police about the incident, which resulted in ""a traumatic condition upon Jane Doe,"" according to a criminal complaint.

The victim had protective orders against Brendon in New York and Florida and he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and violating a protective order.

He was booked into the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility in Banning and released a day later after posting $50,000 bail.

If convicted, Brendon faces up to four years in prison.

The Palm Springs incident followed a series of arrests dating to at least October 2014, when Brendon was accused of causing a disturbance at a Boise, Idaho, hotel.

Brendon was arrested in February 2015 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after he caused extensive damage to a hotel room. A month later, he was arrested in Tallahassee, Florida, on similar charges. He was charged with damage to property and criminal mischief.

In an interview with the Tallahassee Democrat, Brendon characterized the incident as a ""blackout"" after taking nine sleeping pills.

In September 2015, Brendon appeared on an episode of Dr. Phil, where he openly discussed his struggle with depression and alcohol addiction, saying that drinking ""initially quells the anxiety definitely, but then it just adds to the anger.""

595,"CHP investigates man shot, hit by cars after collision on I-80 in East Bay","SAN PABLO (KRON) - The California Highway Patrol is investigating a collision that happened late Saturday night on eastbound Interstate-80 that led to a man being shot at.

Around 11:19 p.m., first responders arrived on the scene near the San Pablo Dam Road overpass.

Officials received reports of a crash involving a black Dodge Charger and a silver Honda Civic, and that a pedestrian, who may have been involved, was walking in the lanes.

CHP arrived to find a man laying on top of the center divider with injuries from being hit by one or more cars.

The victim, who is a man from Hayward driving the black Dodge Charger, told officials that he was being chased by another car heading eastbound. He said both were driving 'recklessly, and in and out of traffic.'

Officials say as the two cars passed San Pablo Dam Road overpass, the man collided with the Honda Civic who was driving in the right lane.

The victim says he drove another quarter of a mile before pulling over in the fast lane and got out of his car.

Authorities believe that the victim started to walk on the shoulder when the driver of the Honda Civic got out of the car and began shooting at him.

Officers say three to four shots were fired but one or two of the shots hit the victims leg. That is when he tried to get away by running across the eastbound lanes of traffic and was hit by an unknown car.

The man was taken to a local hospital where he is being treated for his major injuries. Officials say he is expected to make full recovery.

""The westbound lanes of I-80 were shut down for approximately 45 minutes, while the eastbound lanes of I-80 were shut down for approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes,"" with traffic diverted to the San Pablo Dam Road off-ramp, the CHP said.

CHP is asking for witnesses of the incident to contact them at (707) 917-4491.

598,Gene Autry turn lane project begins Monday and thousands of drivers may be affected,"CLOSE Northbound traffic on Gene Autry Trail waits on May 1 to turn left onto Vista Chino. A second turn lane will help prevent long lines of vehicles. Colin Atagi, DO NOT USE

By now, hopefully most people have heard about a road project that begins Monday and has potential to cause headaches for a lot of drivers. And by ""most,"" we mean several thousand.

It would be an understatement to say traffic delays will occur at Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino for the next few weeks while a second left-turn lane is installed on northbound Gene Autry. One look and it's easy to tell that it's a busy intersection.

Don't assume you'll get lucky and breeze through the intersection; upwards of 30,000 vehicles use that intersection on a daily basis and it's unlikely there will ever be relief from congestion.

Data comes from the Coachella Valley Association of Government's 2017 valleywide traffic count, which indicates Gene Autry at Vista Chino is among the busiest intersections in the desert.

MORE: Palm Springs leader eyes spot on state traffic safety task force

Surveyors counted the number of vehicles on different sides of the intersection and results showed some segments had 30,000-plus vehicles and as little as 28,000 within a single day.

Picture those vehicles condensed into single lanes and moving one at a time due to flashing red lights. On top of that, there will be some restrictions on left-handed turns.

That's what's going to happen on Monday.

Keep in mind, nowadays that number of vehicles could be even be higher whenever Indian Canyon Drive shuts down at the Whitewater Wash due to blowing sand.

About 15,000 vehicles passed through that area on a daily basis in 2017 and odds are many of them have been using Gene Autry whenever Indian Canyon shut down.

Palm Springs city staff have been urging drivers to find alternate routes while construction takes place over the next several weeks. Detours may add a few minutes to everyone's commutes, but it's better than being stuck in gridlock and moving only inches every five minutes.

And the lowest gas price in the desert is ....

Following another week of rising fuel prices, it doesn't look like Coachella Valley drivers should look forward to paying less than $3.77 for a gallon of regular unleaded gas.

That was the lowest price registered at gasbuddy.com, which reports fuel costs across the country. The relatively low price was available in Indio at an Arco gas station on Jackson Street and Circle K on Avenue 42.

Prices are higher on the west end of the valley and they only went as low as $3.85 per gallon. That price was available at an Arco station on East Palm Canyon Drive in Cathedral City.

STOCKTON (KRON/CNN NEWSOURCE) - The Stockton Police Department is investigating an officer-involved shooting on Saturday.

Police responded to the area of Castle Oaks Drive and Marlboro Court after they received a report of a man with a bat trying to get inside a woman's home.

The man was acting erratically and did not comply with officers demands to put the bat down, according to authorities. Instead, the man advanced towards the officers swinging.

That is when the officer shot at the man.

""A baseball bat, as we do know, and we've seen in the past can be used as a deadly weapon so our officer feared for his safety,"" Officer Joe Silva said.

The suspect was taken to a nearby hospital where he remains in critical condition.

The officers involved are expected to be ok.

615,Vallejo PD release body cam footage of fatal shooting of bicyclist; critics say video is edited,"Vallejo police released body camera footage on May 6, 2019 of the Feb. 13, 2018 officer-involved fatal shooting of Ronell Foster. Critics say the video is edited and pushes a police narrative. Vallejo police released body camera footage on May 6, 2019 of the Feb. 13, 2018 officer-involved fatal shooting of Ronell Foster. Critics say the video is edited and pushes a police narrative.

- Vallejo police released body camera video this week stemming from a fatal officer-involved shooting of a man who they say had been riding erratically on a bicycle, prompting some critics to point out that the video is heavily edited and seems to be push the police narrative even further.

“Body camera video is supposed to be a transparency tool. But police are trying to weaponize these videos,” said Henry Gage III, an attorney and a member of the Bay Area-based Coalition for Police Accountability. “They use words like ‘rising up,’ when he in fact was just sitting up. They edit these videos to help them make their argument.”

Gage was referencing the 12-minute video released on Monday following a 2 Investigates California Public Records Request. The video shows the moments before Ronell Foster, 33, of Vallejo was shot to death by Officer Ryan McMahon on Feb. 13, 2018. McMahon first began pursuing Foster when he said he spotting him riding his bike erratically and without a headlamp about 7:40 p.m. that evening. Foster didn’t stop riding his bike and a struggle ensued in a back alley near someone’s home on Carolina Street.

Police said the video was not redacted and released in full. However, most of the video is edited to be viewed in slow motion and has police captions such as, “Foster continues to resist, “Foster now has Officer McMahon’s flashlight,” “Foster is rising up,” when the video shows that he is sitting up from the sidewalk.

When Foster, a father of two, was first killed last year, KTVU reported that police were initially chasing him following a domestic violence dispute call. But that was not mentioned in Tuesday’s release. KTVU left a message with Vallejo police to try to sort out the discrepancy.

McMahon was also one of six officers who shot and killed 20-year-old Willie McCoy as he sat in the front seat of his car near a local drive-through restaurant last February, a shooting that has led to public outcry and one of several factors that led the police department to invite in the Department of Justice to help them with public relations.

“We hope that the material released today provides the community enough information to understand how this incident unfolded,” said Vallejo police Capt. Lee Horton in a statement.

Outgoing Vallejo Police Chief Andrew Bidou added: “Any loss of life is a tragedy and my sincerest condolences go out to the Foster family for their loss.”

Both Foster’s family and McCoy’s family have hired civil rights attorney John Burris in federal cases against the police department.

A day after Foster was killed and long before the body camera footage was released, police issued a news release stating that McMahon and Foster were engaged in a “violent physical confrontation.” The officer deployed his Taser, but it was ineffective and Foster then managed to “forcibly take away a metal flashlight from the officer and armed himself with it, presenting it in a threatening manner,” according to the news release. “The officer, fearing imminent and serious physical harm, discharged his duty firearm.”

Police reiterated that same message in captions on the video released by the department on Monday.

But that’s not what Gage saw.

“All I saw was a lot of shadows and a man on the ground,” he said.

Gage added how “insulting” it is that Foster was being chased for “such a minor underlying crime,” pointing out the tragedy that this chase and struggle became yet another “street execution.”

Burris also noted that an eyewitness that night reported he never saw “Foster holding anything prior to Officer McMahon opening fire,” his lawsuit states.

According to the lawsuit, Foster had been on his bicycle talking with a group of friends and when he began to ride away, a police officer started to “stalk” him. It was “out of fear,” that Foster got off his bike and ran toward an alley, Burris contends.

Burris also described a narrative in stark comparison to what police describe: Foster was unarmed and struck over the head with a flashlight, causing a gash in his head. After he was tased, he tried to run away again over an alley fence. “Shockingly, Officer McMahon gunned Mr. Foster down with his pistol striking Mr. Foster several times in the back and the back of his head,” the lawsuit contends.

Burris’ suit was filed before the body camera video was released.

In the video, only the last 90 seconds or so contain raw footage of the shooting, some of which is muted because of a normal audio delay. McMahon is heard breathing heavily after he fired the fatal shots.

The dark and grainy images show Foster lying on his back and side as McMahon shoots him with his stun gun. Foster leans up and appears to make a move toward the weapon but because of the jostling of the camera, it’s hard to tell what exactly is going on.

McMahon seems to have a stun gun in his left hand and his flashlight in his right hand. The video shows him striking Foster several times with the flashlight.

After the struggle, the video shows Foster appearing to turn away from McMahon when the officer shoots him. Foster collapses into nearby bushes, as McMahon’s flashlight falls to the ground.

Police didn’t say how many times Foster was shot.

The Sacramento Bee reports the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office has identified the shooter as Ulrich Smith and his victim as 58-year-old Janet Trigg.

The office says deputies surrounded the home Thursday after receiving calls from a woman who said she believed her daughter had been shot by Smith.

Deputies confirmed the homicide suspect was still inside the home and negotiations began about 4:30 p.m. An hour later, sheriff deputies heard a single gunshot.

Officials say deputies found the bodies of Smith and Trigg inside the home.

624,Tulare County man will remain on Death Row for 1997 double murder,"CLOSE Gov. Gavin Newsom called the death penalty ""a failure"" that ""has discriminated against defendants who are mentally ill, black, brown, or can't afford legal representation."" Wednesday Newsom placed a moratorium on California's executions . (Mar 13) AP

A Tulare County will remain on Death Row despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order signed in March.

This week, the California Supreme Court upheld the conviction and death sentence of Juan Sanchez.

“There is a reason why Californians support the death penalty, and that reason is Juan Sanchez,” said District Attorney Tim Ward.

Sanchez, now 54, was found guilty of the 1997 deaths of Ermanda Reyes and Lorena Martinez.

In the early morning of Aug. 4, 1997, Sanchez broke into Reyes' home. Sanchez sexually assaulted 17-year-old Martinez and then shot and killed both the mother and daughter.

Oscar Reyes, 5 at the time, saw his mother and sister died and walked alone to Reyes' sister-in-law's home for help.

Oscar told the family that his mother and sister were “sleeping,” they were “bleeding” and “cut,” and he couldn't wake them up.

The sister-in-law went to the home, prosecutors said. The front door was open.

Oscar later told Porterville Sgt. Chris Dempsie that he had been sleeping in his mother’s bed and woke up to the sound of ""firecrackers."" The boy said he saw his mother walking toward the telephone next to his bed. He also saw a man in the room with her.

He would later tell detectives he knew the suspect and had met him a few days before.

Several witnesses testified to Sanchez knowing the family. Sanchez confessed to the murders, but denied raping Lorena.

However, there was evidence on Lorena that she had been raped and sodomized with a foreign object. Sanchez's DNA wasn't found in the home, according to court records.

Sanchez was convicted of the double murder and rape in 2004 and sentenced to death.

His main arguments during his appeal were that Oscar shouldn't have been allowed to testify. When he did testify, he said he didn't remember many details.

Sanchez also argued that his confession was coerced. Detectives, he claimed, threatened to put him in a cell with a “crazy man . . . so he can kill you.” He also said detectives didn’t read him his Miranda Rights and failed to record portions of the interviews.

After reviewing the case, Supreme Court justices decided to uphold Sanchez’s confession and found Oscar's testimony ""legally admissible.""

Oscar was able to distinguish between the truth and a lie and remembered that he told officers the truth on the morning his mother and sister were killed, according to the court's ruling.

Justices found the following:

""Defendant contends the cumulative effect of the asserted errors was prejudicial. We disagree. Any errors were minimal and had no cumulative effect.""

""Defendant reiterates numerous challenges to California’s death penalty law that we have repeatedly rejected. We adhere to our previous decisions.""

In March, Newsom signed an executive order that establishes a moratorium on killing convicts on Death Row.

“Gov. Newsom isn’t the only one protecting this killer; the broken death penalty process has done that for years,"" Ward said. ""This defendant filed 38 requests to extend the time for filing his appeal and delayed this case for well over a decade. There must be truth in sentencing – victims are at least owed that.”

The governor's order granted an immediate reprieve for all individuals sentenced to death in the state. It drew power from a governor’s ability to commute death sentences.

Typically, such commutations are done individually.

Sanchez can continue his appeal by filing a writ of habeas corpus. The last person to be put to death in California was Clarence Ray Allen, who was 76.

The man accused of driving drunk and killing three people while they slept in their trailer is free for now after bailing out of the Sutter County Jail. That crash happened Saturday night along Highway 113, a busy roadway between Knights Landing and Yuba City. On Monday, a California Highway Patrol investigator met with family members outside the mobile home park where 33-year-old Ismael Huezo-Jardinez was arrested for allegedly killing two parents -- Jose Alberto Pacheco and his wife Ana Pacheco -- and their 10-year old son Angel. “As soon as he came out of that vehicle, he was so intoxicated I could smell the alcohol from 10 feet away,” said Steven Bravo, a neighbor who was one of the first people on the scene Saturday night. Neighbors in the trailer park said they were incensed to learn Monday that Jardinez is free, released from the Sutter County Jail on $300,000 bail. “I don’t like it because now he has the option to run,” said neighbor Debra Franklin. “He has nothing to lose by running.”Mary Ann Mason, another neighbor wondered, “What if he doesn't come back for his court date? What if he can't be found to be held accountable? And I think he should be held accountable for the three lives that he took and the little girl who is now an orphan.”That girl is 11-year-old Mariana Pacheco. Her family sent KCRA 3 a photograph of her recovering from her injuries at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, where she is listed in serious condition. “This is one of the most serious kind of cases that we handle,” said Cameron King, a deputy district attorney with Sutter County. “We're pretty vigorous in our prosecution of DUI cases.”King said Jardinez is scheduled to be in court June 10 for arraignment. The Sutter County Sheriff’s Office told KCRA 3 that Jardinez had a prior conviction for reckless driving, but had no further details.King told KCRA 3 his office has not yet received the case file from the CHP, but when asked about Jardinez’s $300,000 bail, he said, “That is the scheduled bail amount for three counts of vehicular manslaughter of this nature. It’s not unusual that bail is set. It’s probably unusual that a person is able to pay that, at least this quickly.”Meanwhile, residents of the trailer park on Jennings Court, located just a few feet from Highway 113, are demanding protections from speeding drivers. “There is no guardrail,” said Debra Franklin. “I think a guardrail or something would at least slow down, it would grab a driver's attention. It might make him think twice before he speeds up.”In a statement to KCRA 3, Caltrans said its “Traffic Safety unit is conducting its own investigation of the section of State Highway 113 where Saturday’s fatal crash occurred; however, our engineers will need to review the completed CHP report to help determine which changes are warranted. Safety is Caltrans’ highest priority. Our condolences go out to the victims and their families.”The trailer home next to the Pachecos belonged to the grandparents of Mariana and Angel Pacheco. That home has now been condemned because it suffered too much damage in the crash -- and now the grandparents have had to move out.",https://www.kcra.com/article/neighbors-outraged-dui-suspect-bails-out-of-sutter-county-jail/27382040,2019-05-07T01:56:00Z,KCRA-TV,Couple,"3 Television Cir, Sacramento, CA 95814, USA",CA,95814
635,"After 40 years, Desert Sun reporter Bruce Fessier will retire with prolific legacy","A few months ago, I sat in a dimly lit Palm Springs bar, chatting with a group of patrons over red wine. When they found out I worked at The Desert Sun, their eyes went wide.

“Do you know Bruce Fessier?” they exclaimed, though I couldn’t tell if it was with admiration or horror.

“I’m his editor,” I answered.

Then they broke out in laughter.

I get it. Bruce is a few decades my senior. He’s been a staple of the Coachella Valley community since he joined The Desert Sun in 1979.

They went on to say how much they enjoyed reading Bruce’s stories, how he made celebrities feel accessible – like real people. For the last 40 years, Bruce has taken our readers inside the lives of Frank Sinatra, Sonny Bono, Bob Hope, local mobsters and the like. He still has a letter from Frank Capra, in which the director said he found a profile Bruce wrote to be ""one of the most graphic articulations of who and what I am.""

Bruce has covered every Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival – all 20. And each of the 13 Stagecoach country music festivals. He joined Bono on the founding committee for the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and has covered that event every year since it began in 1989.

He's a regular at local theater and charity events. He co-founded the Desert Theatre League in 1987. On any given evening, Bruce will cover shows ranging from Barry Manilow at The Show at Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa, to John Garcia and other Kyuss alumni rocking out inside Palm Canyon Roadhouse. Last year, he attended both of those events in one night.

Bruce is perhaps the most well-sourced journalist in the California desert. He seems to know everyone, and everyone seems to know him.

Which is why it’s bittersweet to announce that on June 3, Bruce will write his final column. He’ll retire from The Desert Sun having left an indelible mark on this paper, and the way we’ve covered arts and entertainment. He and his wife, Jane, will continue to live in the Coachella Valley.

(Photo: Marilyn Chung/The Desert Sun)

It has been one of the greatest honors of my life to sit next to – and work with – such a legendary reporter. Bruce told me he was hired at The Desert Sun because he had experience with computers, even though we didn't have any at the time. During his first week, he worked on a typewriter, and it snowed in Palm Springs.

Here's what I told that group of strangers in the bar: I might be Bruce’s editor, but I learn from him every day. He’s impressed upon me the importance of honoring the past in a way that provides context for the present, and future. He’s unapologetically himself and that doesn’t change whether he’s talking to Rami Malek, Lucie Arnaz or a man off the street.

You’ll find him dressed up for the Palm Springs International Film Festival awards gala, and casual in jeans amid the dust out at Stagecoach – sweaty, a bandana over his face, often standing alone inside the Palomino tent, most recently swaying back and forth to Lynyrd Skynyrd’s wailing guitars.

He's challenged me to be bold – as a journalist, as a woman. He's taught me to take risks and have fun while I'm doing it. He's taught me to write as long as I want and let an editor deal with it.

I am a better person because of Bruce Fessier.

And while I've been learning from him, he, too, has never stopped learning. His computer sits propped up on “The Encyclopedia of the American Theatre.” Once, Bruce called me at the office to see if I could read a notation from a spiral-ringed notepad he’d left on his desk. There were so many piled up next to his old Radio Shack tape recorder, I couldn’t find the correct one.

In all of those scribbles are the stories of our valley. For 40 years, Bruce has kept this community informed, entertained and enlightened. He's also given back.

In 2013, he helped start The Desert Sun's Tachevah Music Showcase to offer local bands greater exposure and connect our valley's musicians with established industry veterans. He wanted to nurture local talent, and the event reflected a change in the Coachella Valley's art scene over the last four decades. While Hollywood A-listers and galas still highlight the season, generator parties have given rise to a more youthful, homegrown movement concentrated in the east valley.

In a 2014 column about his 35th anniversary, Bruce paraphrased Joni Mitchell to describe his time at The Desert Sun: ""It's the most fulfilling way I've found to be a cog in something turning.""

He says that still rings true.

Our wheels have spun thanks to his watchful eye, satiric humor and intrepid curiosity. His words will be deeply missed on our pages – his laugh, his stories, cannot be replaced in the The Desert Sun building.

But this isn’t goodbye.

It's more like the farewell that Bruce offers me every night when we leave the office – the sky dark, a breeze rustling the palm trees in its own desert melody:

“We’ll see ya.”

This is hardly the first time someone has accessed a crane. In April 2018, this man dangled perilously from a crane in Hollywood before he came down and surrendered to police.

In 2017, at least two incidents occurred. A man pursued by police climbed a crane at the port, and in downtown L.A. a man safely surrendered to police after climbing a tower crane.

One person who authorities said tried to run from a two-car collision was detained by a civilian in Palm Desert on Saturday.

The unidentified man was detained by a person at the scene, the CHP said.

It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured in the collision.

TAIWAN (KRON) - Who knew Apple products had such... resiliency?

A Taiwanese man was surprised to learn one of the Apple AirPods he accidentally swallowed still worked, even after he had to pass the device through his system, and salvage it from the toilet.

Ben Hsu reportedly fell asleep with the Airpods in his ears and woke up realizing his right Airpod was missing.

Using the tracking feature on the device to locate it, he heard a beeping sound coming from his stomach, the publication reports.

Hsu then went to the hospital where an x-ray confirmed the missing AirPod was located in his stomach.

The doctor gave Hsu some laxatives and two days later, he passed the AirPod through his digestive system and was reunited with the missing earpiece!

He even filmed a video of himself, digging through his own waste, to show you that it all really did happen.

Hsu told local media he washed the AirPod and it functioned properly.

""'The battery was still at 41 percent! It was incredible,' he told The Daily Mail.

If Hsu had not successfully passed the AirPod through his system, plan B would have been surgery.

644,"26-year-old Avenal man killed in crash southeast of Avenal, CHP says","KINGS COUNTY, California - A 26-year-old Avenal man was killed in a three-car crash southeast of Avenal on Friday morning, the California Highway Patrol said.

Around 5:20 a.m., CHP's Fresno Communications Center received a call of a three-vehicle, head-on collision on Highway 33 north of Highway 41.

Officers from the Coalinga CHP office were dispatched to the scene.

Charles Penner, 43, of Paso Robles, was driving a 2013 Ford north on Highway 33 at approximately 58 mph. At the same time, another driver was driving a 1995 Honda south on Highway at approximately 55 mph. Directly behind the Honda was Anna Oliveros, 38, of Avenal, driving a 2004 Ford south at approximately 55 mph.

CHP said that for unknown reasons, Penner allowed his 2013 Ford to cross into the southbound lane and into the path of the Honda.

Neither party avoided the collision and the vehicles collided head-on, CHP said.

As both vehicles spun out of control, Oliveros' vehicle struck the left side of the 2013 Ford.

Due to his injuries, the driver of the Honda was transported via air ambulance to Adventist Medical Center where he was pronounced deceased, CHP said.

He was only identified as a 26-year-old Avenal man. His name has not been released.

Alcohol and or drugs are not suspected to be a contributing factor, CHP said, but the collision remains under investigation.

649,Video caught woman dumping 7 puppies behind California store,"COACHELLA, Calif. (AP) - Authorities are trying to identify a woman captured by security cameras tossing seven newborn puppies into a dumpster in Southern California.

The Riverside County Department of Animal Services released surveillance video of the woman pulling up to a dumpster behind an auto parts store in Coachella Thursday afternoon.

The video shows her stepping out of a white Jeep, peering into a dumpster used for recyclables before dropping a plastic bag into the trash dumpster and driving away.

A man who rummaged through the trash shortly afterward spotted the bag and took it to the store.

Authorities said the puppies, believed to be 3-day-old terrier mixes, may not have survived the 90-degree heat had they not been found within an hour of being dumped.

660,Big Bear's fire escape routes high risk,"High Desert equipped with telephone notification system to alert residents to evacuate

There are three main routes out of the Big Bear Valley, but what happens when one of those routes proves too dangerous for evacuations during a large-scale wildfire?

That question became a reality during the Old Fire, which burned more than 91,000 acres after joining the Grand Prix Fire in October 2003. More than 1,000 structures were destroyed and six people were killed, ranking the Old Fire 11th and 16th, respectively, on CALFIRE’s lists of the 20 most-destructive and deadliest wildfires in state history.

The Old Fire was one of 14 major fires that burned simultaneously during what the U.S. Department of Agriculture later dubbed the “California Fire Siege of 2003.” By the time all 14 were extinguished, 24 lives were lost, 3,710 homes were gone and more than 750,000 acres were scorched.

For Big Bear Fire Department Chief Jeff Willis, the Old Fire is one that’s difficult to forget. He told the Daily Press evacuations were complicated by an influx of people in the Big Bear area at the time.

“The first communities that were evacuated were Lake Arrowhead and Running Springs, and the evacuation route that most chose was coming to Big Bear,” Willis said. “A few days later ... the Big Bear community needed to be evacuated, so we experienced a situation where we were artificially high (in population).”

The three routes out of the Big Bear Valley are highways 330, 38 and 18, Willis said. During the Old Fire, an estimated 80,000 full-time residents were evacuated from the San Bernardino Mountains between Oct. 25 and Oct. 29, according to a 2003 Daily Press report.

Evacuees in Big Bear experienced a 28-mile traffic jam into Lucerne Valley on Highway 18. Willis said that route was shut down, which “forced the issue on the other two” highways.

Ultimately, the Old Fire never reached Big Bear and none of the six deaths occurred there, but the small number routes available for evacuations remains a pressing issue.

An analysis released last week by the USA TODAY Network-California placed the ZIP codes that comprise Big Bear, Minnelusa and Sugarloaf within the worst 1% statewide when it comes to population-to-evacuation-route ratios.

Another community included within the worst 1% was Paradise, the Northern California town decimated by the 153,336-acre Camp Fire that killed 85 in November.

Paradise, as well as Big Bear, Minnelusa and Sugarloaf, are considered very high risk zones, according to the USA TODAY analysis.

Paradise had five two-lane roads and one four-lane road leading out of town, according to an Associated Press report based on the analysis. The Camp Fire forced officials to close three of those routes, further clogging the remaining roads.

Looking at ZIP codes and multiple population data sets, the analysis found, on average, 134 Californians living in the riskiest areas for each lane of traffic going in either direction. Only one out of 20 ZIP codes had more than 313 people living in the riskiest areas for each lane of traffic.

Paradise had more than 1,000.

But some areas, such as Oak Park in Ventura County, South Lake Tahoe in El Dorado County or the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, have two, three or five times the number of people living in the highest-risk zones, per lane of major roadway out, compared to Paradise.

No other section of San Bernardino County was within the worst 1%, but Caltrans spokesperson Terri Kasinga said the expanse of the agency’s District 8, which includes 49 cities in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, doesn’t decrease congestion during evacuations when major fires break out.

“It actually increases congestion with substantial delays on multiple routes surrounding the incident on both state and local roadways,” Kasinga said. “Caltrans, CHP and other partner agencies provide viable detours during incidents in an attempt to mitigate traffic impacts.”

How District 8’s road infrastructure fares amid fires that prompt evacuations depends “on the location and magnitude of the incident,” according to Kasinga. She said the detours offered prove “sustainable” during large-scale incidents.

During 2016’s Bluecut Fire, which burned 37,000 acres, Kasinga said Caltrans worked with the California Highway Patrol, and the San Bernardino County Fire and Sheriff’s departments as part of Incident Command in addition to San Bernardino County Emergency Management.

“Caltrans has multiple plans to respond to natural and man-made disasters,” Kasinga said, including a Continuity of Operations/Continuity of Government Plan, an Emergency Operations Plan, a Technology Recovery Plan and the Pandemic Response Plan.



“The COOP/COG does not replace any of those plans; however, it complements them,” she said.

Between 80,000 and 86,000 residents in the West Cajon Valley, local mountains and part of the High Desert found themselves in the Bluecut Fire’s sprawling evacuation area, according to County Fire and Sheriff’s Department officials.

Spokesperson Jodi Miller said the Sheriff’s Department believes less than half of those residents complied with the evacuation orders. Even so, the “sheer volume hinders getting residents out of the area,” according to County Fire spokesperson Tracey Martinez.

Martinez added, though, that County Fire had an “extensive” plan in place to ensure the timely evacuation of all 80,000+ residents had they left, as well as three portable shelters capable of housing more than 15,000 people combined.

“One of the arsenals in our tool box is the Telephone Emergency Notification System,” she said. “We use TENS only in crisis situations.”

The system uses listed and unlisted numbers in the region’s 911 database to alert residents of life-threatening emergencies. It’s updated every six months and has placed hundreds of thousands of calls during wildfires and flood events since 2004.

But the 911 database only includes landline phones. Martinez said county residents can visit www.SBCounty.gov/SBCFire/TENS/TENSContact.aspx to register their cell phones. Those without internet access can dial 211 to sign up.

Willis, meanwhile, said at least half a dozen wildfires have posed some type of threat to the Big Bear area in the last decade, meaning the community must be constantly prepared.

He said the most effective approach requires a “holistic” program that starts with his department’s capability, capacity, training and equipment, and includes reducing risks in the community by ensuring residents replace shingle roofs and create defensible space around their homes.

Despite the congestion that resulted on roads, Willis said the Old Fire was a good example of early evacuation orders, which are also crucial.

“California is highly fire prone,” Willis said. “You’re not going to find anywhere else in the United States that compares to California ... so all those things have got to come together.”

Meyer's father said he told Claremont police about two transactions in Oklahoma City. Claremont police then called Oklahoma City police. But it took until Thursday to determine exactly where the ATM was.

Meyers family said it's a relief to know they're a step closer to finding their son's killer. But it's all still very painful.

The California Highway Patrol safely removed a suicidal man from an on-ramp overlooking Highway 99 after more than 10 hours.CHP first was notified of the man threatening to jump from the East Stockton Boulevard on-ramp to southbound Highway 99 by a call at 2:30 p.m. Thursday to the Sacramento County Communications Center. About 45 minutes later, CHP closed the highway at Mack Road in an effort to prevent injury or death to the man and also to any drivers who might be traveling underneath him.Over the course of the next 10 hours, officers from both the Sacramento Police Department and CHP tried to convince the man to give up, but they were unable to.""This on-ramp had 360-degree view for him, so there was really no way we could actually kind of sneak up on to him to maybe use a less lethal shotgun to actually bring this to a resolution,"" said Officer Jim Young with CHP. ""At that location, on the on-ramp over there, the guardrails are very, very low. So, most of the time, the individual out there was actually straddling the guardrails. So, it's kind of hard to approach him because any time we got close to him, he said, 'Well, I'm just going to jump if you get any closer,'"" Young said. Early Friday morning, a CHP officer who works in the south Sacramento office recognized the man on the bridge from a picture. The officer asked a sergeant about approaching the man because of their established relationship.""(The officer) told one of our sergeants, 'I know the individual. I've made contacts with him. He trusts me, so would I be able to go talk to him?'"" Young explained. With the help of CHP's crisis intervention team, the officer helped bring that man to safety. They told him that he wouldn't face legal trouble and wanted to get him help. Young said most people in these cases are taken to a hospital on a 72-hour hold while a social worker helps set up mental health care. In this case, he said, someone working with the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department was working to arrange that care.Amid a peaceful outcome, CHP faced backlash, particularly on social media, for shutting down the highway. The law enforcement agency responded Friday.""Think about it. If it was your wife, your husband, your child, your mother or father who was up there in crisis, who was threatening to take their life, wouldn't you want law enforcement to take every step possible to make sure that your loved one wasn't hurt?"" asked Young. ""We're sorry for the inconvenience, but at the same time, we are responsible for that individual's life and we take that seriously at the California Highway Patrol. And so because of that, we wanted to make sure we took as much time as possible to make sure this came to a peaceful resolution.""Young said the man has a family and CHP wanted to make sure they could be reunited. David Bain, executive director for the Sacramento chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said he was happy officers were able to safely get the man off the bridge. ""It's not an easy thing to necessarily talk someone off the ledge sometimes because if you say the wrong thing, they can still jump,"" Bain said.Bain also expressed disappointment in those who felt inconvenienced by the highway closure. He said people are often self-centered about things that affect them.

The PACE program has been a boon to the solar industry, but a Visalia decision could put a halt to that. (Photo: Eric Woomer)

Property Assessed Clean Energy is dead in Visalia.

Along with it, the number of future solar customers citywide.

After six years, city council members sent the program commonly known as PACE packing in a 4-1 vote following a heated, standing-room only council meeting on Monday.

Visalia homeowners and local contractors are left with one fewer financing option for energy efficiency upgrades and critical home improvements, as a result.

The decision comes as a reversal: Visalia City Council previously voted to support the program in 2017.

More: Visalia city council votes to keep PACE

What is PACE?

PACE is a program that finances the upfront costs of energy and water saving measures on homes and allows the owners to repay the loan over time as a line item on their property tax bill — similar to general obligation bonds.

Councilman Brian Poochigian spearheaded the council's move to reconsider the program after he says several constituents approached him, believing that the city endorsed the loan.

""I don't think we should be endorsing one private loan over any other,"" Poochigian said, reflecting the majority view of council members. ""I'm happy Visalia is no longer involved in loan processing.""

He dismissed concerns from solar companies, which rely on the program to help get residents financing.

More: Clean energy programs could bring an economic boom

""Most of the (PACE supporters) came from Sacramento, San Diego, Los Angeles,"" the councilman said. ""We're looking at what's best for Visalians.""

PACE has been offered as an option for Californians since 2008, though cities must vote to opt-in to the program.

The program was conceived as an option for homeowners who lacked large up-front costs associated with energy improvements, such as solar and air conditioner replacement.

Since the loan was borrowed against home equity, an individual's credit and income played a minimal factor in qualifying for the loan, though that has changed with recent state legislation introduced to beef up consumer protections.

Pros and cons

Critics of PACE, however, characterize the program as a ""predatory lending scheme"" enabled by local government.

Proponents counter that PACE loans make clean energy affordable to many, improves local air quality and stimulates the economy.

""As a business owner, I can say a significant number of projects and a significant number of jobs would be adversely impacted if PACE is rescinded,"" said Ben Siebert, who owns Planet Solar, a solar contractor based in Clovis.

Low-income and credit-challenged residents will be disproportionately impacted by the removal of PACE, Siebert said.

Tim Ramage, a Visalia solar contractor, said his company averages 600 solar systems and 300 roof installations across several states each month, about 10% of which are financed through PACE.

""For me, it's all about consumer choice,"" Ramage said. ""I'm fairly certain we're still in America and we have the right to choose for ourselves what is the best loan option for our homes and our specific circumstance.""

The Tulare County Association of Realtors fiercely opposed PACE in Visalia, arguing that homes making use of the program are ""impossible to sell"" because of ""super-liens"" placed on properties as a result of PACE, which acts as a second mortgage.

Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Authority will not offer financing to homes with a PACE loan out, which further complicates sales, Realtors said.

""My Realtors are guaranteed job security with (PACE), because they make it so difficult to buy and sell homes that it guarantees my Realtor's job forever,"" said Brett Taylor, CEO of Tulare County Association of Realtors. ""We're not here saying (PACE) is either good or bad for industry. We're here saying it's bad for homeowners.""

Taylor and other real estate agents offered a litany of anecdotes to council members, describing a number of scenarios where homeowners were misled by PACE administrators and left saddled with debt they didn't have the means to repay.

Supporters pointed to industry reforms and legislation that have increased consumer protections under PACE beginning in 2017.

""What (critics are) describing is the PACE of 2016 and before,"" said Jeremy Hutman of Renew Financial, a PACE loan administrator. ""They're not describing PACE under the new regulatory legislative regime that have standardized consumer protections.""

'A mixed bag'

Since PACE loans are attached to borrowers' property tax bills, county tax collectors are responsible for collecting payments. This makes the program unique among private lending programs.

""The idea of PACE is a good thing, but the idea and the implementation seem to be two different things — a bit of mixed bag,"" said Cass Cook, Tulare County's Auditor-Controller and Treasurer-Tax Collector.

County tax collector's office staff report that they have received calls from PACE administrators purporting to be county or state officials.

""Which is interesting, because we are the county, and they were representing themselves as county employees,"" Cook said.

Since PACE payments are assessed on property tax bills, Cook says homeowners who choose to make their payments early are often hit twice.

""For example, if they pay their loan in August, it's already going to be on their tax bill that they then pay in December,"" he said, adding that PACE administrators are often slow to reimburse those payments. ""People get upset and come to the tax collector, but our hands are tied and we can't do anything.""

Shortly before Monday's council meeting, Cook said a man visited his office complaining that he'd unknowingly bought a home with a $19,000 PACE loan attached to it — a loan that he's now liable for.

""They came to us for relief, and we can't do anything for them,"" he said. ""Someone dropped the ball, and it wasn't disclosed by the title company....Those are some of the challenges faced by the tax collector's office.""

Cook noted a 4% delinquency rate among PACE loans, similar to regular property tax delinquency across the county.

Currently, 528 homes in Visalia currently hold a PACE loan, Cook said.

Council crushes PACE

Council members drew on Cook's testimony and Realtor feedback in their near-unanimous decision to cancel the program in Visalia.

""This is a tough one but my position has never changed,"" Vice Mayor Steve Nelsen said. ""I don't think public government needs to be in a private industry or support a private industry.""

""I take exception that we take our tax collector and make them an arm of private industry,"" he added. ""As an industry, (solar) should be able to survive without (Visalia's) help.""

Nelsen pointed to a number of PACE alternatives, including ""energy loans"" offered by banks.

""It takes a little work to seek it out, but it's doable,"" Nelsen said.

Councilman Greg Collins was the lone PACE supporter this time around.

""We represent the people in Visalia, but I look at it a little differently,"" he said. ""We have people whose energy bills exceed their mortgage payments during the summer months. Maybe their air conditioner goes out, maybe they would like to conserve water or conserve energy — this program provides that opportunity.""

While future PACE loans are now unavailable to VIsalians, current borrowers will remain unaffected by the vote.

""I would like to give lower-income people all the opportunities they have to keep their energy costs down, or water costs, or to repair leaky roofs,"" he added.

The decision also only affects properties within VIsalia city limits. Homeowners in the county and neighboring cities — Exeter, Woodlake, Tulare, etc. — can continue to make use of PACE programs.

""Regardless of (council's) vote, we're gonna do right by the taxpayer,"" Cook said. ""We will continue to do our job and do it well.""

694,Man dies after crash on Highway 33 in Kings County,"Victim's Honda was struck head-on just north of Highway 41

An Avenal man was killed in a traffic accident on Highway 33 just north of the Kern-Kings County line early Friday.

The California Highway Patrol said the victim, a 26-year-old man whose name has not been released, was driving a 1995 Honda southbound on Highway 33 just north of Highway 41 at approximately 55 miles per hour when an oncoming Ford crossed from the northbound lanes into the southbound lanes and struck the Honda head-on.

After the vehicle collided, the Ford spun out of control and struck a third vehicle.

The Avenal man was critically injured and was airlifted to Adventist Health in Fresno where he was pronounced dead.

The driver of the truck, identified as Charles Penner, 53, of Paso Robles, suffered moderate injuries in the crash and was also transported to Adventist for treatment. The driver of the third vehicle, Anna Oliveros, 33 of Avenal, was not injured.

The CHP said both the Avenal man and Penner were wearing their seatbelts.

695,"Man gets 36 years in deadly gang shootings, including at Salinas house party","A Salinas man received more than 36 years behind bars for a crime spree that included a deadly shooting at a house party to help the Norteños, federal prosecutors reported Wednesday evening.

Antonio Cruz, 32, previously pleaded guilty to accusations that, between 2009 and 2011, he hunted Sureño gang members, including helping two others ""to shoot up (a Sureño house) party,"" according to a press release from the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California.

That shooting killed one person and injured another while Cruz served as the getaway driver, a role he would repeatedly reprise, prosecutors said.

More: Salinas gang member gets 15 years for robberies, racketeering

Cruz also admitted to gunning down a man thought to be with the Sureños Dec. 2, 2009, on Lohman Street as the victim walked outside to warm up his car, prosecutors said. Cruz pleaded to those allegations Oct. 3, prosecutors said.

As part of his plea, he admitted to being a part of the Norteño gang known as ""Santa Rita"" in addition to his role in the ""Salinas Norteños Enterprise,"" made up of ""several violent Norteño cliques in Salinas,"" prosecutors said.

""Among other acts of violence, members of Santa Rita sought to attack and kill members of rival Sureño gang cliques, as well as members of other rival gangs,"" the press release said.

The Norteño Enterprise also engaged in violent, anti-Sureño attacks.

On Nov. 19, 2010, Cruz and others with the Enterprise discovered and reconnoitered a house party at a Sureño hangout.

As one accomplice kept a lookout, Cruz drove two of his eight co-defendants up to the party, prosecutors said. Cruz armed the pair with a .40-caliber Glock pistol with a high-capacity magazine.

The suspects approached the party as Cruz sat in the driver's seat, prosecutors said.

When they got to the driveway, the shooting started — Cruz's accomplices opened fire, killing one person and injuring another.

Cruz also served as a getaway driver for heists as well, including stealing $800,000 in jewelry and $92,000 in cash from three banks and one jeweler in about six months, starting June 2, 2010.

Cruz and eight other defendants were indicted by a federal grand jury on racketeering charges. He has been fined $324,915.

Cruz also helped with other murders, such as when Cruz and passenger drove around Salinas, looking for a Sureño target.

They thought they spotted one.

Cruz stopped. His unnamed passenger got out, aimed the gun and opened fire, killing the victim.

Prosecutors say that homicide is part of a complex case involving nine defendants, including Cruz, accused of various crimes:

12 murders

7 attempted murders

Undisclosed number of armed robberies

Three other suspects—Julian Ruiz, Anthony Lek and Robert Loera—have pleaded guilty and were sentenced to between 12 years and 17.5 years in prison each.

Upon release, they will be under supervision for five years.

697,California desert Deadheads keep memory of Grateful Dead alive in 'modern-day Shakedown Street',"Share This Story Tweet Share Share Pin Email

On the early evening of February 26, 1977, the Grateful Dead mingled backstage before their concert at the Swing Auditorium in San Bernardino, Calif. Returning to the road after a long hiatus and nearing completion of two stressful, expensive projects – a self-produced movie and a failing record label – the band was at a personal and professional crossroads. As the crowd filed into the venue, an airy and ornate theater holding a capacity of 10,000, a tense anticipation hung over the scene, heavier than the marijuana smoke that rose like fat nimbostratus clouds to the ceiling. It was the band’s first concert of the year.

A teenage high school student from El Camino Real named Mark Chlebda wandered through the crowd at the Swing. With his brain marinating in psychedelics, he carried a stack of heavy cardboard posters, created for the show on his school’s printing press. While attempting to sell them for a couple of bucks, someone interrupted his sales pitch.

“Hey man,” the guy said, “You spelled San Bernardino wrong.”

Chlebda looked down, let out a string of expletives, and then just gave all the posters away – except for one. He needed something to write the setlist down on, a common ritual of a Deadhead obsessive. The band took the stage and the crowd erupted in cheers.

Sitting in his Twentynine Palms backyard more than 40 years later, Chlebda lights a cigarette and shakes his head, still amazed by those crazy, hazy days. After a lifetime of rambles, with stints in California, Chicago, southern New England and back West again, Chlebda speaks in the low tones of a Midwestern drawl, with just enough East Coast attitude to wake up the doves nesting in the rafters of his porch.

“The Swing was a trippy, old venue,” he said. “That night, there was all of this tension, this energy, and once the Dead started playing, a hush fell, everything got quiet. We all just stood in awe.”

Nearly 25 years after the death of founding member Jerry Garcia, high desert fans like Chlebda have kept the memory of the Grateful Dead alive through music, memorabilia and creative artistic mashups combining desert imagery and the band.

On his Highway 62 podcast, which streams “genre-free radio” on an underground website called the Flying Eye Radio Network, Chlebda highlights the Grateful Dead often, mixing in the band’s oeuvre with lots of punk, soul and roots music in between. For Chlebda, it’s all part of the human musical experience.

“I saw the Rolling Stones in 1975 and I thought nothing would be better,” he said. “But then I saw the Grateful Dead and these guys do everything! Rock, country, blues, jazz. It just smacks me right in the face, man.”

Rudy Jansen, a ""deadhead"" is photographed at his home in Morongo Valley in April of 2019. In this photo he looks holds some to the etchings he has used for print screening on themes of the Grateful Dead musical band.

'Two-Bit Piece'

For Morongo Valley artist Rudy Jansen, the Grateful Dead serves as both a muse and a creative outlet.

Working out of a rustic studio made of scraps of wood, Jansen’s entire workspace is covered in stickers and graphics sent by other Deadheads from around the world. He represents a 21st century Deadhead, an obsessive that connects with other fans, not only through face-to-face meetups, but via the Internet and social media. As an artist, Jansen combines the visuals of the Grateful Dead with desert images in t-shirts, stickers and patches.

Yet even with his hyper-connected reach online, Jansen’s introduction to the band’s music was decidedly old-school.

“I’ve been a longtime fan of traditional old-time folk music,” he said, “and seeing the Dead’s songbook, I recognized stuff like ‘Casey Jones’ and ‘Stagger Lee’ but they re-worked those songs into their own thing.”

A film writer and director by trade, Jansen and his wife, Elizabeth, arrived in Los Angeles by way of Nebraska in 2013. The switch from modest Lincoln to the hustle of the metropolis rapidly changed from exciting to exhausting, and the couple found refuge in the high desert.

Follow Jansen gingerly up a set of rickety steps to a small tower room above his studio, and with the afternoon sunlight piercing through the dusty windows, he puts on a live Bob Dylan record and takes a long pull of beer. His careful and deliberate sentences are dressed up in humble, Midwestern manners.

Yet as an artist, Jansen doesn’t treat his work with any sense of preciousness. Every image and idea is up for grabs, regardless of its origin, and Jansen’s Grateful Dead mashups are a tribute to both. Via linocut and screen prints, Jansen’s work loosely follows the tradition of artists adding their own designs to well-known visuals, turning those images into something new, usually to highlight a local scene or a cause.

Rudy Jansen, a ""deadhead"" is photographed at his home in Morongo Valley in April of 2019. In this photo he looks at some of his drawings he has made of the Grateful Dead imagery.

His first run of t-shirts was a mashup of the Dead’s iconic “Steal Your Face” logo with a desert scene of coyotes and cactus. Jansen donated the proceeds of sales to Joshua Tree land management nonprofit Mojave Desert Land Trust. According to Jansen, “a bunch of L.A. Deadheads” taught him the basics of screen-printing, and creating t-shirts seemed like the most accessible product that would sell well.

“The idea was to do one t-shirt design and give back to the desert,” he said.

In many ways, Jansen’s approach is a continuum of what the Grateful Dead envisioned way back in the mid-1960s: Artists can re-imagine traditional work through experimentation and make it their own. Now working under the name “Two-Bit Piece” on Instagram – the name comes from a line in the Grateful Dead song “Row Jimmy” – Jansen has branched out to stickers and patches now, too.

While the Grateful Dead is typically associated with Northern California locales, Jansen feels the presence of the band in the high desert.

“Although the Dead never played up here, the nature aspect of their music lends itself to wild places,” he said. “The songs have those themes. Nature and the world, those themes match out here as well. The music, in many ways, has gone beyond the band. I kind of predict that, in time, Dead songs will become our next folk music standards.”

Modern-day Shakedown Street

Those timeless themes – community, appreciating the natural world and sharing ideas – all bring up a constellation of memories for Mieka May. A high desert hippie incarnate, with an avalanche of wavy brown hair and a penchant for bohemian clothing, May had the unique experience of, as she describes it, “growing up on tour.”

Throughout the early 1990s, May traveled with her family in a converted bus, following the Grateful Dead around the country whenever the band was on the road. Her father, graphic designer Michael Ginsburg, created Grateful Dead stickers to sell at concerts, beginning in 1988. The operation provided both fun and profit, affording her father the ability to travel and make a living. His work eventually led to an official gig with the band: Ginsburg created large stage screens, both the graphics and animation, for the Grateful Dead’s huge stadium tours of 1990 and 1991.

“Both of my parents are Deadheads,” May said. “We had a tour bus named ‘Ben’ that was converted into a living situation with a VW van on top. The van loft was my room.”

As they traveled across the country, May watched the landscape of America change through the prism of stickers that plastered the Ben bus windows. The country and the Grateful Dead were changing, as well. The conservative winds of the Reagan Revolution were slowly beginning to shift into something more open and accepting, as globalism made the world seem a lot smaller. The Grateful Dead were in a resurgence, too, as a new generation of fans discovered their music. The intimate concert halls where the band learned their craft had now turned into stadiums.

One staple of these new Grateful Dead concerts included the parking lot scene before and after shows. Dubbed “Shakedown Street,” these get-togethers connected Deadheads who cooked food, played music or sold homemade wares, usually with the hope of raising enough cash to get to the next show (or to fund some extracurricular stimulants).

Now the owner of Flamingo Heights boutique, Moon Wind Trading Co., May believes her unconventional upbringing turned out to be a gift, informing her as a person and businesswoman. Her father’s stickers became, in a sense, a symbol of something much larger than their modest beginnings. It offered sharing, community and possibility.

“We would take the stickers with us on tour with the Grateful Dead and they were a huge hit,” May said. “Everyone had to have at least one. There are still some floating around that you can get at Moon Wind Trading Co. Today, I think of my store as a modern-day Shakedown Street.”

During their travels, May and her family saw the Grateful Dead perform at some of country’s most storied venues, such as Madison Square Garden in New York and Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado. Those early memories shaped her in ways that still resonate through adulthood.

“The Grateful Dead lightens my heart,” she said. “It brings me back to my childhood and reminds me to loosen up, love life, be present and enjoy the ride. I’m so grateful for my upbringing into that micro-scene of the world.”

That sense of gratitude still radiates from May. You can see it in her shop, and the art and goods she sells – many from local desert artists. After all of these years and all of those miles, the music has not faded away. She has the stickers that started it all – Jerry Garcia’s image pulsing like a burning sun, another of a VW bug driving through a desert landscape, probably on tour – still available for a new generation.

And the fate of the Ben bus? May’s family converted it into a nightly rental property, complete with electricity and furnishings. Today, it sits at their Monroe, Utah resort called Mystic Hot Springs.

Even the galaxy of hippie stickers that decorate the bus have survived the long, strange trip.",http://rssfeeds.mydesert.com/~/601110372/0/palmsprings/home~California-desert-Deadheads-keep-memory-of-Grateful-Dead-alive-in-aposmodernday-Shakedown-Streetapos/,2019-04-23T12:56:21Z,Desert Sun,Couple,"750 N Gene Autry Trail, Palm Springs, CA 92262, USA",CA,92262

706,8th grade football phenom shot and killed at party,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Jaylon McKenzie / State Representative LaToya Greenwood

(CNN) -- Jaylon McKenzie had plans of going to the NFL.

The 14-year-old from Belleville, Illinois, was an eighth-grader who already had college offers from University of Missouri and University of Illinois. He was featured in the Future Issue of Sports Illustrated in November 2018 along with five other teen sports stars. He wanted to be a pro star in California, playing for either the Los Angeles Rams or Chargers.

Those dreams died late Saturday when Jaylon was shot and killed at a party, his mother, Sukeena Gunner, told CNN.

Around 11:40 p.m. Saturday night, Illinois State Police said in a release, numerous law enforcement agencies responded to reports of a disturbance and shots fired at a large party in Venice, near the Illinois-Missouri border.

Jaylon had been at that party when a fight broke out, Gunner said. Jaylon walked outside to leave the party, and a stray bullet hit him. He and a 15-year-old girl were taken to a hospital where Jaylon died a short time after, police said. The girl is in critical condition, police said.

East St. Louis School District 189, where Jaylon was a student, confirmed that some of its students were shot at the party Saturday night.

""School District 189 has learned that a few of our students were shot at a house party in Venice, IL at some point Saturday night,"" a statement from the district read. ""Few details are clear at this point. We do know that our youth, families and school staff have dealt with a number of tragedies and incidents of violence this year. We request space and time for them to appropriately grieve and come to terms with this latest impact of violence.""

'I just started screaming'

Gunner told CNN Sunday that her family was usually traveling every weekend for some type of football-related activity.

Because Jaylon played on a summer travel football team, played basketball and ran track, he didn't usually attend parties.

But May was slower, she said, so Jaylon had more free time.

Gunner said Jaylon was with friends Saturday night.

""They stopped by the party, not with any intentions to staying long,"" she said. They were there to pick up something from a friend, she said.

Around midnight she received a call from Jaylon's brother with the news.

""I just started screaming,"" she said. ""I just prayed and asked the Lord not to take my baby.""

Gunner said she and the family are having a hard time coming to terms with Jaylon's death.

""It's very hard,"" she said. ""It's still like a bad dream, like I'm gonna wake up in the morning and my baby's gonna be smiling at me asking for something to eat like he always does.""

Jaylon's first word was 'ball,' mother says

Jaylon was the youngest of five children, Gunner said.

The middle-schooler always loved football. His first word was ""ball,"" according to his mother.

""He just loved the ball. From the moment he was able to walk and catch, he just wanted the ball,"" she said.

At 3, Jaylon was already getting up on Saturday mornings and dressing up like he was going to a game.

At 5, he started playing tackle football, his mother said.

""You could see the talent at 5, but at 6 it was like 'Wow where did this come from?' and each year he just got better and better,"" Gunner said.

When he first started playing, Jaylon wore No. 3 on his jersey, but he changed that to the No. 6 when he was 8 years old because he idolized De'Anthony Thomas, who played for Oregon and is now a receiver for the Kansas City Chiefs. Jaylon was also a fan of Tavon Austin and Odell Beckham Jr., his mother told CNN.

""He just loved to watch them and perfect his craft,"" Gunner said.

But there was more to Jaylon outside of football and sports, his mother said.

Jaylon was big on fashion and ""loved to dress,"" Gunner said. He loved sneakers, video games, shopping and hanging out with his ""select group of friends.""

Gunner also said her son had a ""beautiful smile"" and was soft spoken.

""He wasn't a man of many words,"" she said. ""He had a humbling personality. He wasn't very outgoing, but everybody knew him and loved him.""

Politicians and athletes respond to Jaylon's death

Illinois Rep. LaToya Greenwood posted a tribute on Facebook about Jaylon.

""There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love. #JaylonMcKenzie""

Former NFL wide receiver Earl Bennett also tweeted his condolences.

""My heart and prayers goes out to Jaylon McKenzie family and friends. Matthew 5:4,"" he wrote. The scripture he cited reads: ""Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.""

711,Year-long manhunt for a valley man accused of beheading his girlfriend is finally over,"LOS BANOS, California - A year-long manhunt for a Los Banos man accused of killing his girlfriend with a sword is finally over.

Authorities say they pulled the killer's body from a river last year but just confirmed his identity through a DNA match last month.

CBS47's Joey Horta has reaction from the family of the victim in an eyewitness news exclusive.

Together as a family, Katherine Cunningham's mother, sister and grandparents walk into First Baptist Church in Winton.

""I believe that god was with her."" This grieving mother, Jenifer Cunningham is referring to the day when her 26-year-old daughter was brutally murdered.

Her body found on Camano Island in Washington state. She was living there off-the-grid with her boyfriend Jacob Gonzales.

Her family believes he snapped. ""I think she was trying to leave,"" Jenifer says.

Investigators say Gonzales cut her head off.

""His DNA was found on the sword that killed her,"" Jenifer says. DNA was key in both connecting him to the murder and then identifying his badly decomposed body.

Authorities say Gonzales drowned.

He was pulled from the Feather River in Sutter County in April of 2018 but it would be another year before a DNA match would confirm his identity.

""I think he took the easy way out,"" says Katherine's sister Emma.

They grew up together in this church, were baptized in this very basin together and went to school in Atwater.

Emma even has two tattoos in memory of her sister.

""It says god is within her, she will not fall. It's just kind of a reminder everyday that you can still conquer things,"" Emma says.

She has another one complete with Tinker Bell that reads ""those we love don't go away, they walk beside us everyday.""

Now that Gonzales is no longer a threat, the family can finally focus on grieving.

""It's closure but it's not the closure we wanted,"" Emma says. They want to know why he did it and to see him punished.

""And I don't think that's fair,"" Emma says.

Her family now trusting in a higher power that Katherine is in a better place. ""I think she's healing in heaven,"" Jenifer says.

All they can do now is try to move forward without her-- forever changed.

713,Man tells Fresno Police he killed stepson during violent attack of mother,"FRESNO, California - A man who shot and killed his stepson on Thursday told Fresno Police that he did it to defend his wife – the stepson's mother – as she was being violently attacked.

The call came in around 8 p.m. at Cedar Avenue and Buckingham Way, just off of Ashlan Avenue. Fresno Police Lt. Bill Dooley says the father called 911 claiming he shot his adult stepson.

His stepson was found dead at the scene.

He was identified Friday as Elden Baker III, 42, of Fresno.

Detectives learned that during the disturbance, Baker became enraged and began hitting himself in the face and slamming his head into the refrigerator, police said.

Baker turned his anger toward his mother and began assaulting her while forcing her to the floor, police said. The mother has a medical condition that could become life-threatening if attacked in such a manner.

The stepfather, who was identified Friday as 61-year-old Steven Perry, attempted to physically protect his wife, but his efforts were ineffective, police said.

The stepfather armed himself with his handgun and told police he ultimately fired to protect both his wife and himself from the violent attack.

Both the mother and stepfather suffered visible injuries as a result of the attack.

The case has not yet been determined to be self-defense and is being investigated as a homicide, police said.

Perry, who is a former reserve police officer with an out-of-county agency, was released at police headquarters with no charges being filed against him, police said.

Anyone with information should call the Fresno Police Department at 559-621-7000.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — An air conditioning repairman charged with murdering a Chicago-area teenager and two California women, one the ex-girlfriend of actor Ashton Kutcher, would ""watch, shadow, stalk and hunt down"" his victims before fatally stabbing them for sexual pleasure, a Los Angeles prosecutor said during opening statements Thursday.

Michael Gargiulo's trial began with a prosecutor outlining the California murders for jurors, calling the defendant ""the boy next door killer"" and his crimes ""the methodical and systematic slaughter of women.""

""What you will hear is that Michael Gargiulo for almost 15 years was watching, always watching,"" prosecutor Daniel Akemon said. ""And his hobby was plotting the perfect opportunity to attack women with a knife in and around their homes.""

Gargiulo, 43, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder and an attempted-murder charge stemming from attacks in the Los Angeles area between 2001 and 2008, including the death of Kutcher's former girlfriend, 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin.

Gargiulo was arrested in 2008 after DNA evidence linked him to one of the killings and a non-fatal attack. He was separately charged with killing an 18-year-old Glenview, Illinois, woman whose father found her fatally stabbed on their family's doorstep, house key still in hand.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Gargiulo's attorney, Daniel Nardoni, reminded jurors during his opening statement that his client is presumed innocent and said other men had better access or motive in the killings.

He also pointed out that no murder weapon has been found and no DNA evidence connected Gargiulo to the killing of Ellerin.

Gargiulo's trial is expected to take six months. Kutcher, who is married to Mila Kunis, is among the witnesses expected to take the stand.

Kutcher's ex-girlfriend was found dead in 2001 in her Hollywood Hills home. Kutcher told police he went to pick up the fashion student-model for a post-Grammy Awards party, but she did not answer the door.

He checked a back window and spotted what he thought were red wine stains on the carpet and then left. Her body was discovered the next day by a friend.

Another victim in the case, 32-year-old Maria Bruno, was found stabbed to death in her apartment in suburban El Monte in 2005. Her breasts had been cut off. One victim survived a stabbing attack in her Santa Monica apartment in 2008.

Gargiulo was a neighbor of each victim at the time of the attacks.

The teenager killed in Illinois, Tricia Pacaccio, lived just down the street from Gargiulo in suburban Glenview. Gargiulo was a friend of her brother's and 17 at the time Pacaccio was stabbed to death on her front porch.

Later police said DNA collected from Pacaccio's fingernails matched Gargiulo.

A Visalia woman was arrested after police said she stabbed her ""significant other"" in the back during an argument.

Around 1:30 p.m. Visalia police officers responded to reports of a stabbing in at Manzanita Street and Pershing Avenue, close by to several northwest Visalia schools.

The caller reported that a man had been stabbed in the lower back.

When officers arrived, they were told that an argument broke out between a couple at the home. At some point, Kimberly Escarsega, 31, stabbed her ""significant other"" in the back, police said.

Police didn't say what type of weapon she used or if the couple was married.

The man's injuries were ""non-life threatening"" and he refused medical treatment, said Sgt. Daniel Ford.

After speaking with several witnesses, Escarsega was arrested.

She was booked into Tulare County Pretrial Facility on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. Her bail was set at $50,000.

If anyone has any information on this case, call Visalia Police Department at 734-8117.

722,"Death penalty upheld for Porterville rapist, murderer, district attorney announces","TULARE COUNTY, California - The California Supreme Court upheld the decision to keep a 54-year-old man's death penalty in place after two 1997 first-degree murders.

Juan Sanchez was found guilty of killing Ermanda Reyes and Lorena Martinez, mother and daughter, in the early morning of August 4, 2017.

Sanchez entered the Porterville home of Reyes and her 17-year-old daughter, Martinez. Sanchez proceeded to sexually assault the teen, then shot and killed them both.

In an attempt to appeal his death sentence, he argued that Reyes' surviving son, who identified Sanchez as the murderer, was too young to testify. However, the California Supreme Court upheld Ermanda's youngest son was legally admissible regardless of his age since he was able to distinguish between the truth and a lie and remembered that he told officers the truth on the morning his mother and sister were murdered.

“There is a reason why Californians support the death penalty, and that reason is Juan Sanchez,” said Tulare County District Attorney Tim Ward.

733,Manteca police release video of fatal 2017 officer-involved shooting,"MANTECA — The Manteca Police Department has released video of a 2017 officer-involved shooting that resulted in the death of a 58-year-old man.

Earlier this year, the department received a Public Records Act request for video of the shooting, and released it to the requesting party on April 3.

The city of Manteca posted the video, which includes graphic content within the first three minutes, on its YouTube page Friday morning.

On Feb. 15, 2017, officers from the California Highway Patrol and the Manteca Police Department responded to a report of a man walking in and out of traffic along Highway 99 just south of Lathrop Road.

Officers contacted 58-year-old Jose Feliciano, who was armed with a knife, police said.

Manteca police Officer Mitchell Ellis, a nine-year veteran, fired three shots into Feliciano, who was “five to seven feet” away and charging at him wielding a 3½- to 4-inch knife, according to the 17-page report released by the District Attorney’s Office. Feliciano may have been suicidal, the report says.

Feliciano was treated at the scene and transported to an area hospital, where he died from his injuries on Feb. 22, 2017.

In March, the District Attorney’s Office determined the use of force was justified and no criminal charges were warranted.

The 17-page report was released to the public on April 2.

734,UPDATE: Coroner identifies body found inside vehicle in Tehama County,"Tehama County image (Photo: File image)

Updated, 11:15 a.m., Friday

The man found dead inside a vehicle in a Tehama County orchard Thursday morning has been identified as Eric Peterson, 57, of Gerber, the coroner said.

Peterson was found inside his 2000 Jeep Cherokee by CHP officers around 7 o’clock Thursday after somebody reported spotting the vehicle near East Chard Avenue and Samson Avenue in the Gerber area. The Jeep had a tree on top of it.

A CHP investigation revealed that Peterson was speeding west of Samson when he failed to negotiate a turn and went into an orchard before his SUV hit a tree.

Original story

Authorities found a person dead after spotting a vehicle in a field in the Gerber area of Tehama County on Thursday morning, the California Highway Patrol reported on its Traffic Incident Information page.

Just before 7 a.m., a report came in of a vehicle in a field just north of East Chard and Samson avenues. The vehicle had a tree on top of it.

It's unclear whether the body was inside the vehicle.

Authorities believe the vehicle had been in the field for some time.

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection officials also responded.

More details were not immediately available.

760,Dozens gather in Desert Hot Springs for community prayer after police chief put on leave,"CLOSE DHS Police Chief Dale Mondary was put on paid administrative leave April 29, 2019 while an investigation into potential misconduct is completed Wochit

About 50 people congregated Friday evening in front of the Desert Hot Springs Police Department for a community prayer in the wake of police Chief Dale Mondary's placement on paid administrative leave earlier this week amid an investigation into potential misconduct.

For about 30 minutes, residents took turns sharing their thoughts about the chief, the investigation and the accusations that he sent sexually charged Facebook messages to the girlfriend of a city police detective.

Many praised what Mondary has done since he took the job in 2015.

Desert Hot Springs resident Donna Poyuzina, who wore a DHSPD shirt, said she was close to Mondary's family. She said he routinely informs the public about fires and accidents, in addition to responding to issues.

""Can you separate just the public man from the private man and let it be?"" she asked.

""He's an amazing man. What he did for my city — no chief has done.""

Former Desert Hot Springs Councilman Joe McKee said he was hopeful the investigation will reveal what happened and that everyone involved gets closure.

""But, as far as what the chief has done for this community, it is immeasurable,"" he said. ""We need to separate the fact that he is a human being from the fact that he has done a really good job.""

She called Mondary ""a man of great integrity"" andadded that the vigil was meant to show him residents stand behind him.

""Don't come out and slander a man before you have the facts,"" she said.

Before leading the group in a prayer, Kephyan Sheppard, a pastor at Word of Life Fellowship Center, shared the reasoning behind the gathering.

""We're not here to ascertain guilt or innocence,"" he said.

""We cannot allow this to make us bitter. We can let it make us better. Today, we're going to pray that we build from this, that we grow from this and that we get better from this.""

761,Dogs seized from Coachella home ready for adoption; owner accused of dumping pups in trash,"CLOSE A woman who dumped a bag containing seven 3-day-old puppies behind a Coachella auto parts store is being sought by Riverside County law enforcement. USA TODAY

Dozens of dogs seized from the house of a Coachella woman suspected of dumping 3-day-old puppies in a trash bin are ready for adoption, say animal services officials hopeful each will get a new, loving home.

“The dogs are cute, but lack good social skills,” Riverside County Animals Services spokesman John Welsh said.

All but one of the dogs were moved to the Western Riverside County/City Animal Shelter in Jurupa Valley on Thursday.

“Unfortunately, people were not knocking down our doors for these dogs,"" Welsh said. “Everyone wants one of the puppies,” he said, adding that those are still being fostered.

But there was some good news for one of the dogs, which remains at the Coachella Valley Animal Campus in Thousand Palms where a rescue coordinator with Animal Samaritans is working to find it a permanent home, Welsh said.

“The others came here to the facility in Jurupa Valley where we have an in-house spay/neuter clinic ready to alter the pooches if/when they get adopted,” Welsh said Friday afternoon.

“Our great pals nearby — the Mary S. Roberts Pet Adoption Center (a nonprofit organization) — picked up six of the dogs this afternoon. So, that’s a good thing,” he said.

The dogs were found living in cramped quarters at the home of Deborah Sue Culwell, 54, of Coachella, when Riverside County Animal Services and sheriff’s deputies arrested her on her on suspicion of several charges of animal abuse and animal abandonment on April 22.

The county impounded the dogs at the Animal Campus in Thousand Palms and Culwell relinquished ownership of them earlier this week, opening the door for them to find new homes.

They were moved Thursday to the shelterin Jurupa Valley, where they are ready for immediate adoption and/or transfer to rescue partner organizations.

The dogs, which range from about 1 to 5 years old, can be handled, but many appear nervous, officials said.

They’re skittish and not used to being handled with love, nor do many know how to walk on a leash, officials said. But they are not as aggressive as initially thought.

Animal services officials asked that people “please consider saving a life today. These pooches deserve a second chance and a much more loving home than they’re used to having.”

Culwell was arrested after officials linked her to a surveillance video showing a woman tossing a plastic bag into a trash bin outside of an auto parts store in Coachella on April 18, not far from her Third Street home.

A man collecting recyclables from the bin found the bag and contacted a store employee and Riverside County Animal Services was called.

The 3-day-old puppies have since been in the care of Noni Boen Schirm of Rancho Cucamonga, founder of the Feline Underground Network nonprofit animal fostering group.

On Sunday, she posted photos of the six remaining puppies, some with their eyes open, after giving them their first bath.

One of the puppies died a few days after being rescued but the remaining six are making progress through Schirm’s care. She feeds them Esbilac, a milk formula for puppies, by syringe.

It is an around-the-clock job for Schrim, who said, “I never sleep.”

Animal services officials said they were told by Culwell that the puppies were from two different mothers. On Monday, an animal services veterinarian said they would not attempt reuniting the puppies with their mothers because so much time had passed they feared the puppies may be rejected.

“The woman who has graciously dedicated many hours and a fair amount of her own money toward these abandoned puppies is doing a great job,” said Dr. Allan Drusys, animal services director and chief veterinarian.

Culwell faces seven counts each of animal cruelty. She is out of jail on $10,000 bail and scheduled to return to court in Indio on June 18.

764,Manteca PD releases video of 2017 fatal shooting,"MANTECA — The Manteca Police Department has released video of a 2017 officer involved-shooting that resulted in the death of a 58-year-old man.

Earlier this year, the department received a Public Records Act request for video of the shooting, and released it to the requesting party on April 3.

The city of Manteca posted the video, which includes graphic content within the first three minutes, on its YouTube page Friday morning.

On Feb. 15, 2017, officers from the California Highway Patrol and the Manteca police responded to the report of a man walking in and out of traffic along Highway 99 just south of Lathrop Road.

Officers contacted 58-year-old Jose Feliciano, who was armed with a knife, police said.

Manteca Police officer Mitchell Ellis, a nine-year veteran, fired three shots into Feliciano, who was “five to seven feet” away and charging at him wielding a 3½- to 4-inch knife, according to the 17-page report released by the District Attorney. Feliciano may have been suicidal, the report says.

Feliciano was treated at the scene and transported to an area hospital, where he died from his injuries on Feb. 22, 2017.

In March, the District Attorney’s Office determined the use of force was justified and no criminal charges were warranted.

The 17-page report was released to the public on April 2.",https://www.recordnet.com/news/20190503/manteca-pd-releases-video-of-2017-fatal-shooting/1?rssfeed=true,2019-05-03T10:59:21Z,recordnet.com,Couple,"530 E Market St, Stockton, CA 95202, USA",CA,95202
765,DA: Tulare County man sentenced to life in prison for murder,"TULARE COUNTY, California - A 24-year-old man was sentenced to life in prison for a 2016 murder, the Tulare County District Attorney's Office announced Thursday.

Kashmer Bailey was sentenced to 82 years to life in prison after being found guilty of shooting at several people, killing one victim in February of 2016.

At around 1:21 a.m., Bailey was walking in a Tulare neighborhood after an argument with his girlfriend. After pacing in an intersection for a bit, he walked up to two men standing in front of their home.

When the victims asked who he is, he pulled out a revolver and started shooting at them. One victim, a 24-year-old man, was struck in the head while the other victim, a 27-year-old man, escaped the shots.

Bailey fled and was chased by the surviving victim as well as another witness. Bailey was taken into custody by Tulare Police about an hour later, a block away from the crime scene.

Bailey was found guilty of one count of first-degree murder with the special allegation that he personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing death, and one count of attempted murder.

782,A mother can make you or break you,"Next Sunday is Mother’s Day. A day when we collectively remember the contributions those brave ladies who birthed us made to our existence. Yes, it is a “made up” holiday that often has more significance for Hallmark’s bottom line than the depth of feeling felt by a harried husband searching for that last card at Albertson’s Saturday night at 10 p.m., but still it is the thought that is supposed to count.

If you had a good loving mother that dedicated her soul and all waking hours to making you a better person, you are lucky and probably old. Starting after World War II, mothers routinely went to work. The stay-at-home mom became a rarity by the sixties and is now seen as out-and-out sexism. Stay-at-home dads are a “thing” now. My father and grandfather would have never understood that term.

My mother, God bless her, was the fourth of five girls born to second-generation immigrant German parents. Germans are not known for their touchy-feely personalities and raising a gaggle of girls in the depression was a chore. My mother never got the attention she craved from her father and so sought it elsewhere, ending up married and pregnant at 16. It took her 25 years to finish high school, but she managed to do it, four children and three husbands later. I don’t remember when my mom didn’t have two jobs. People today who complain about having two low-wage jobs to survive are not breaking new ground in California, at least not in my experience.

We got our first TV when I was about six years old and I grew up watching ""Ozzie and Harriet"" and ""The Donna Reed Show."" The father and mother in those shows always seemed to be home and the mom role was like an understanding maid/cook/therapist.

Compared to my home life, it was always easy to separate the make believe of Hollywood families from the reality of ours and my friends. I was the baby, so an older brother and sister left home early. Ostensibly to live with the real father, but really to be free from the rules at our house. Brother ended up in the Navy at 16 and my sister followed in mom’s footsteps with a child and husband in hand at 16 years old.

My other sister, was only four years older than I, so we mostly grew up together. Due to mom’s schedule we were on our own quite a bit. We never starved and always had a good place to live. It made us self-reliant. If you wanted clean clothes to wear to school, you got off your fanny and did a load of laundry. If you wanted to eat, you made yourself lunch and dinner from what were available.

I always felt that the last few husbands mom took on were primarily to give me a man to grow up with that I could look up to. In a real sense, that was a sacrifice that topped the Donna Reed mom who vacuumed the house while wearing a skirt and pearls in a stylized version of perfection.

The humble jumble emotional turmoil of our family life has been played out in millions of other families over the years. Mine wasn’t special in that way. But I learned an important lesson. Individuals can use their upbringing as an emotional crutch that negatively impacts their own view of love and family life or an example of what they wish to avoid. Psychology would be a lost profession without the subject of damage done by mom and dad to help clients recover from.

I know my growing-up experience certainly shaped what I hoped my own family life would be. Emphasis on stability, support and being available for each other — always. The core of that hope was a good nurturing, loving woman who would do the heavy lifting and help shape great kids we could be proud of and forgive me when I was being stupid. So far, so good.

While all of this seems a bit introspective to bring up before Mother’s Day, it is only to make the point that we must really celebrate the good mothers and try to understand and forgive the moms that fall a little short in our experience. I have never been a mother. I sometimes found the expectations I had of myself for being a father a little overwhelming, so I can’t imagine the deep sense of responsibility and connection one feels when this living being comes out of your body, even though I have witnessed it in my own home.

My mother could leave us all day. I could wander the neighborhood with my buddies, dig tunnels in the vacant lot and never fear for my safety. Of course, we weren’t all that bright, either. The 21st Century mother has a lot more on her plate than mine did.

Anyone who voluntarily, not accidentally, takes on that role is, in my opinion a superstar.

It is an often thankless, always undervalued and seldom well-paid life-long career.

Being a mother must be crammed into the same space as being an employee, a wife, a teacher, a cook, a nurse, an IT expert and a dozen other roles that those of us who aren’t moms seldom fully appreciate. I couldn’t do it. Like most men, I don’t have the endurance or patience. Mom has the final word in most families, and so it should be.

Thank you to all the moms out there for your sacrifices to do your best for those you brought into the world. We may not always emulate, understand or listen to you, but we love you all the same.

MADERA, California - Staff at Tesoro Viejo made a special tribute to a holocaust survivor who made it all the way from Auschwitz to the Central Valley to start a new life.

Martin Morgan was 13 years old when he was taken to the Nazi encampments.

""He was just a little kid in a concentration camp,"" Morgan's wife, Betty Jean Morgan said.

Martin was a family man, a business man, and cattle rancher.

Martin and his wife bought 30 acres of land in Madera County to start an orange grove and soon bought another 150 acres for cattle ranch that is adjacent to the land that is now a part of Tesoro Viejo.

"" He was a hard worker. He couldn't sit still. He'd wake up at three in the morning, wanting to go to work and I would tell him let's wait till the sun comes up,"" she said.

Betty Jean remembering her husband on this Holocaust Remembrance day, Martin passed away four years ago.

She was to going to miss the moment when her late husband was honored by the community he loved with staff naming their new amphitheater in his memory.

"" He was our neighbor and he was so proud of what we were doing because it was bringing his vision to life this is what he always imagined of Madera County to become,"" Tesoro Viejo Vice President Karen McCaffrey said.

The amphitheater will have it's first concert on May 31 and the public is invited to attend.

794,LA Times: Family paid $6.5M for admission to Stanford,"- According to a Los Angeles Times report, the family of a Chinese student who was admitted to Stanford in 2017, paid $6.5 million to get her into the school.



A source tells the Los Angeles Times, they paid the money to college consultant Rick Singer, the man at the heart of the investigation.

It is unclear if they knew whether they were doing anything wrong.

Neither the student, nor her family members who live in Beijing, have been charged with a crime, according to the report.

Stanford released a statement saying it did not receive the $6.5 million from singer or from the student's family. The school says it was not aware of the reported payment until the news report.

Meanwhile, a California couple pleaded guilty on Wednesday to taking part in the college admissions bribery scheme.

Bruce and Davina Isackson, of Hillsborough, pleaded guilty Wednesday in Boston federal court. They left the courthouse without commenting.

The Isacksons are the first parents in the case to plead guilty. They are the only parents who have agreed to cooperate with investigators and testify against others if asked.

They are accused of paying $600,000 to get their daughters into the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles.

Authorities say the Isacksons paid to rig the entrance exam score for one of their daughters and get both girls admitted to school as fake athletic recruits.

""No words can express how profoundly sorry we are for what we have done,"" the couple said in a statement provided by attorney David K. Willingham. ""Our duty as parents was to set a good example for our children and instead we have harmed and embarrassed them by our misguided deeds.""

Fourteen Bay Area residents charged in college admissions scandal

Twelve other parents have agreed to plead guilty.

They include ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman, who will appear in court May 13.

Parents and coaches cooperating with investigators in the college admissions bribery scandal could spell trouble for those still fighting the charges and lead investigators to new targets.

Since authorities arrested dozens of parents and coaches in March, former coaches at the universities of Texas at Austin and Southern California have signed cooperation agreements.

Former federal prosecutor Bradley Simon says their cooperation also likely means there will be a new wave of indictments.",http://www.ktvu.com/news/la-times-family-paid-65m-for-admission-to-stanford,2019-05-02T16:00:47Z,KTVU,Couple,"2 Jack London Square, Oakland, CA 94607, USA",CA,94607

804,Inside Desert Politics: The meaning behind the meaning,"Welcome to Inside Desert Politics, your guide to the happenings in Coachella Valley, California and national politics. I'm Marie McCain, your host.

In this week's edition, summer is coming and so are the vacation renters; get your tickets for the May 30 Desert Sun Storytellers event featuring stories from people affected by homelessness; the second installment of a periodic feature called “Marie’s Glossary of Politically Relevant Words.”

Let me start off this week’s edition by thanking everyone who wrote in or emailed me in response to last week’s newsletter about political jargon.

As a word nerd who’s in a constant search for the “right word,” I am grateful for the contributions to my growing list of political words to define.

That you share this interest lets me know I’m in good company.

A few of you didn’t agree with some of the definitions I provided, which is in no way surprising considering that these words are part of some very hot-button issues in the news today. Please know that I appreciate your reactions and am open to your opinions.

I’d hoped to start a dialogue that would lead to some kind of common ground – a mutual understanding at the most, an agreement at the least – of the definition of these terms and the overarching issues they represent. More on this later ….

One quick aside: Each of the definitions I provided in last week’s newsletter were taken from the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary. None of them were based on opinions or suppositions on my part.

This week, in the second installment of “Marie’s Glossary of Politically Relevant Words,” I’m including a few words proposed by a reader. These definitions are courtesy of Merriam –Webster. com:

Nativism: A policy of favoring native inhabitants as opposed to immigrants; the revival or perpetuation of an indigenous culture especially in opposition to acculturation. Read more here.

Tribal politics (political tribalism): Tribal consciousness and loyalty, especially; exaltation of the tribe above other groups; strong in-group loyalty. Read more here.

Zero sum: of, relating to, or being a situation (such as a game or relationship) in which a gain for one side entails a corresponding loss for the other side. Read more here.

Summer is coming

As the temperature starts to drift into the triple digits and the vacation rental and Airbnb crowds start to plan their annual summer trips to the Coachella Valley, here's a quick guide to some the city ordinances regarding vacation rental properties:

As the market for vacation rentals has boomed, Coachella Valley municipalities have tried to strike a regulatory balance, crafting city ordinances meant to prevent tourists from overwhelming residential neighborhoods while harnessing vacation rentals as a source of tax revenue.

Each of the nine cities in the Coachella Valley now requires homeowners to get short-term rental permits before leasing their homes for less than a month. Homeowners caught violating the city ordinances face fines and citations.

805,"Eviction protest led cops to Salinas 'sovereign citizen,' sex offender with long alias","Suspicious paperwork filed to contest an eviction led authorities to discover a ""sovereign citizen"" didn't register as a sex offender when he moved to Salinas, court records show.

Earlier this week Brett Jones, 51, was found guilty of two counts of failing to register as a sex offender while living in Salinas and Carmel, said Lana Nassoura, deputy district attorney for the Monterey County DA's Office.

Jones represented himself in court proceedings, including at his trial in which he refused to speak, though he posted videos on YouTube about his case as it progressed, Nassoura has said.

But while he was mum at trial, Jones had plenty to say at his preliminary hearing, which was expected to last an hour but ended up spanning two days in January, court records show.

At that hearing, Jones tried to call a U.S. Supreme Court ruling as a witness, and repeatedly interrupted Judge Carrie M. Panetta.

""I do try —"" Panetta began early in the hearing.

""Yes,"" Jones said.

""— not to interrupt, as you just did to me — people,"" Panetta said.

“""See, I don't get to call my witnesses, and so I can utilize the Supreme Court.""” Brett Jones

Jones, wearing a gray hooded jacket and a black shirt, also twice described himself as a ""sovereign citizen"" who has ""30 years of court trial experience"" but said he can't ""normally work"" because of medical issues, records show.

Sovereign citizens ""are anti-government extremists who believe that even though they physically reside in this country, they are separate or 'sovereign' from the United States,"" according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

""As a result, they believe they don’t have to answer to any government authority, including courts, taxing entities, motor vehicle departments, or law enforcement,"" the FBI said in 2010, adding they tend to file many frivolous lawsuits and liens.

Throughout his case, Jones filed many motions, including one to remove Panetta from his case, titled ""A formal complaint: Affidavit & documentation of discrimination due to disability under penalty of divine retribution.""

In that April 25 filing, Jones told the court he has muscular dystrophy and fibromyalgia, among other health issues. He alleged Panetta ignored his medical needs and her conduct was ""designed to coerce, intimidate and torture.""

“""A court opinion isn't a witness.""” Judge Carrie Panetta

Jones, a Jehovah's Witness, wrote that if he lied in that affidavit, he faced a penalty of ""divine retribution"" in addition to perjury, according to the document.

Panetta rejected that motion, filed right before the trial began, because it was untimely and didn't list any legal grounds for removing her.

Jones had moved to Salinas in November 2016, then to Carmel and eventually to Tuolumne County, where DA Investigator Steve Guidi arrested him Dec. 6, Guidi testified in court.

In 1998, Jones—then known as Keefe Branch—was convicted of ""sexual misconduct with a minor"" in Arizona, Guidi said. The following year, he legally changed his name to Brett Randoff Toriano Keeffe Henry Kana-Shaphel Hithrappes Jones-Theòphilus, Nassoura said.

He later went by ""Eeon"" or ""Ee On,"" Guidi said.

""I believed that the individual that I was pursuing had already changed their name and moved from state to state to avoid prosecution and registration,"" Guidi said at Jones' preliminary hearing.

Guidi said he was first alerted to Jones by the Monterey County Assessor-Recorder-Clerk's Office, where Jones tried to file paperwork contesting his 2018 eviction under the name ""Eeon.""

But officials referred the case to the DA's office because Jones tried to file attachments alongside a certified document, which could be considered altering it, Guidi said. Altering a certified document is a misdemeanor.

But investigators discovered that Eeon might be Brett Jones, who was suspected of failing to register as a sex offender, Guidi said.

Jones later moved to Strawberry where Guidi arrested him Dec. 6.

When Guidi searched Jones' wallet, he found a ""driver's license for a rural organization, not a country or state,"" he said.

Nassoura asked Guidi whether he'd read Jones his Miranda rights.

""I tried to,"" Guidi said. ""(Jones said) he did not need an attorney because he had been doing law for 30 years.""

More: This Salinas doorbell camera caught some truly bizarre behavior, police say

Later, Jones asked Guidi if he remembered Jones' reply.

He said Jones told him ""I accept your offer with full immunity without recourse every time I try to speak,"" which Jones said was a verbatim recollection.

""I told you you were alright in my book,"" Jones said to Guidi.

The preliminary hearing stretched into a second day of testimony from Guidi to accommodate Jones' physical ailments.

It began with Nassoura adding a charge of driving without a license. Judge Panetta asked Jones whether he wanted to plead guilty or not guilty.

""Oh no,"" Jones said. ""I plead the fifth.""

A not guilty plea would later be entered, according to a transcript of the preliminary hearing.

After Guidi's testimony, Jones called his only witness, the U.S. Supreme Court case Reynolds v. United States, a 2012 ruling involving sex offender registries that was narrow in scope.

""A court opinion isn't a witness,"" Panetta told him.

""Most definitely it is,"" Jones replied. ""... See, I don't get to call my witnesses, and so I can utilize the Supreme Court.""

Jones told the judge he'd been stymied in his attempts to subpoena individuals, which would have allowed him to call witnesses on his behalf. He said he wanted to call various judges and superior court officials so he could question them about his difficulties with the court clerk and his arraignment.

He said the law requires him to be arraigned within 72 hours of his arrest, and he wasn't arraigned for 79 hours because his morning arraignment was pushed into the afternoon, court documents show.

Panetta told him the preliminary hearing wasn't an appropriate place to discuss and resolve those claims. Instead, she told him to set another hearing and serve the DA's office with official documents about his allegations, so Nassoura could respond.

Jones is facing up to four years and two months in prison after his conviction of failing to register as a sex offender and driving without a valid license, Nassoura said.

In one video Jones posted on YouTube under his account ""Eeon,"" he said he was preparing his appeal and stayed silent at trial because he thought it would strengthen his appeal. He also says the court lacked jurisdiction and treated him unjustly.

His sentencing is scheduled for May 30.

809,2 armed robberies reported near UC Berkeley campus,"- There were two armed robberies on Berkeley city property near the University of California at Berkeley campus early Thursday morning, police said.

The robberies occurred in the wake of a string of four robberies, three of which involved armed suspects, on or near the campus in a four-hour period late on the night of April 24 and early on the morning of April 25.

Police said a group of four male UC Berkeley students between the ages of 18 and 19 were walking in front of the Delta Chi fraternity house at 2721 Channing Way shortly before 12:40 a.m. Thursday when a car pulled up next to them.

Police said three male suspects who were armed with handguns got out of the car, approached the four students and took their backpacks and cellphones.

The suspects fled in a red Dodge and were last seen driving west on Channing Way, according to police.

Witnesses described one suspect as a black man in his 20s with a medium or chubby build and his hair in dreads who was wearing a black beanie cap. The second suspect was described as a black man in his 20s with a thin build.

At about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, three male UC Berkeley students were walking in the 2900 block of Dwight Way when a car pulled up next to them, police said.

Two male suspects armed with handguns got out of the car, and surrounded the students, demanded their property and took their bags and cellphones, according to police.

The suspects then drove away and were last seen driving west on Dwight Way, police said.

Witnesses described one suspect as a black male who is about 5 feet 9 inches tall with a hefty build and short dreadlocks who was wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and the other suspect as a black man in his 20s who is about 5 feet 11 inches tall with a skinny build who was wearing a black mask

on his face. Berkeley police spokesman Byron White said it's too early to tell

if the robberies early Thursday are connected with the ones last week.

At the luncheon, at the Palm Springs Convention Center, Reyes outlined a number of goals for 2019, including fully staffing the department, working more on homelessness, launching a Spanish language Community Police Academy, and improving communication with the community through better use of social media.

He also highlighted some statistics, noting that residential burglaries rose 33% from 2017 to 2018 and car theft was up 10%; he attributed part of the increase to people leaving their homes unlocked and keys in their cars.

The Police Department announced a number of promotions: Melissa Desmarais has been named captain; Erik Larson, William Hutchinson and Mike Villegas were named lieutenants; and Chris Jaeger, Ryan Raso, Kevin Lu and Marcus Litch have made the rank of sergeant.

812,"Tulare County man stole from former boss, faces 10 years in prison","David Bias (Photo: Tulare County District Attorney's Office)

A repeat Tulare County thief is headed to prison after he was found guilty of stealing from his former boss.

A jury convicted David Bias, 48, of first-degree residential burglary, commercial burglary, stealing guns, and car theft.

Each count is a felony and will likely add time to his prison sentence.

This was not Bias' first time in front of a judge. According to court records, he had two prior theft-related convictions from 2010 and 2015.

His most recent run-in with law enforcement stemmed from a burglary on New Year's Day 2017.

That afternoon, an employee went to check on his boss's property in Visalia. When he got to the house, he noticed a work truck stuck in the mud. The pickup truck wasn't there when he checked on the property the day before, the man told police.

During their investigation, Tulare County detectives found an empty safe in the bed of the truck that was taken from the house. Cash and several firearms were stolen from the safe.

The keys to the truck had been taken from a business that belonged to the property's owner, detectives said.

When the victim was told the safe had been opened, he told detectives that he knew who was responsible.

Bias was the only other person who knew the safe's combination. He was the former caretaker of the property and the victim's assistant.

A warrant for his arrest was issued. Bias was booked into Tulare County Pretrial Facility in June 2017.

821,DNA from old razor helps solve California cold case from 40 years ago,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

ATASCADERO (CNN) - Police have cracked a cold case with DNA found on the razor of the man they say raped and killed two women more than four decades ago in California.

DNA from a razor used by Arthur Rudy Martinez matches that left by the attacker at both crime scenes in the late 1970s, the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office said.

Martinez died of cancer in June 2014 at a prison in Spokane Washington, where he was serving life for robberies and two other unrelated rapes.

The two victims did not know each other

The cases of Jane Morton Antunez and Patricia Dwyer date to 1977 and 1978, respectively.

In November 1977, Antunez was found dead in the backseat of her car in Atascadero, California.

The 30-year-old woman had been sexually assaulted and her throat slit. She was on her way to her best friend's house, but never made it, the Sheriff's Office said.

Months later, in January 1978, Patricia Dwyer was found stabbed to death and sexually assaulted in her home.

Like Antunez, the 28-year-old also lived in Atascadero. While the two victims had mutual friends, they did not know each other, authorities said.

""Both victims' arms were bound behind their backs by different bindings that were found at each scene,"" the Sheriff's Office said.

DNA link came from another arrested relative

Biological evidence was recovered from the scene in the 1970s, but DNA technology was not used in criminal cases at the time, authorities said.

For years, both cases remained unresolved. Then this year, a lead from the Department of Justice's Familiar DNA Search team helped crack the case. It obtained a familial DNA comparison from a relative of the suspect whose DNA was in the system as a result of a prior arrest, San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson said.

""Essentially identifies the suspect in this case. ... It really is in simple terms ... it strongly resembles existing DNA profiles in relatives who have many of the same markers in common,"" he said.

When investigators made the connection, authorities reached out to the suspect's girlfriend, who still had items belonging to him. An item from her was tested and the DNA matched that of Martinez, he said.

""This lead was generated by getting a DNA profile comparison and other evidence. The DNA profile was a close match to an inmate serving time for unrelated charges,"" the Sheriff's Office said.

CNN affiliate KSFN reported that DNA collected at the scenes was compared to that taken from an old razor belonging to Martinez. Police linked him to the murders.

""Most likely this case would never have been solved if the initial investigators did not collect the valuable biological DNA evidence that was used to compare to Martinez's DNA,"" the Sheriff's Office said.

The suspect was in prison for assault

Martinez was in Atascadero until 1978 — shortly after Dwyer's murder, authorities said.

He moved to Spokane and later that year was sentenced to life in prison after committing numerous robberies and two other additional rapes, authorities said.

In 1994, he escaped from prison and was on the run until he was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2014, the statement said. He then turned himself in so he could receive treatment and died in prison two months later.

With Martinez dead, many questions remain, including whether he knew these victims prior to their murder.

""Our hearts go out to the families of the victims and are hopeful the resolution to these cases brings them some closure,"" said Sheriff Parkinson. ""With the advancements in DNA technology and having an investigative focus solely on these types of cases, this case proves the value of having this important position.""

Law enforcement authorities spanning two states say they've positively identified the body of a man suspected in the gruesome murder of a Washington woman more than a year ago.

The case had investigators in California and Washington comparing notes about the decapitation of the 26-year-old woman on a Puget Sound island in February 2018, the subsequent discovery of a samurai sword with her blood on it in the trunk of her stolen car near Yreka and the eventual identification of suspect Jacob Gonzales, whose body was recovered a year ago in Northern California's Feather River.

Detective Ed Wallace of the Island County, Wash., Sheriff's Office said he received DNA results Tuesday from the California Department of Justice identifying Gonzales as the man who was found dead in the river last April. Gonzales was the boyfriend of murder victim Katherine Cunningham and the prime suspect in her death.

""He is currently our only suspect,"" Wallace said of 34-year-old Gonzales.

However, he said detectives are continuing their investigation as if it they were preparing for a court case with the possibility of other suspects.

Wallace said he contacted Cunningham's mother, Jennifer, five minutes after learning of the DNA results.

Wallace wishes Gonzales would've been found alive so he could've questioned him and allowed the woman's family some closure with what he might've said.

""My hope was to interrogate him and provide answers to Katherine's family,"" Wallace said. ""He cheated the family of answers.""

A $1 million nationwide warrant was issued for Gonzales' arrest after a neighbor and friends came across Cunningham's body wrapped in a sleeping bag on Camano Island on March 3, 2018.

Cunningham and Gonzales were living together in a travel-trailer on the wooded, rural property. Investigators determined the woman was actually killed in mid-February last year and only discovered down a ravine several weeks later.

Meanwhile, the California Highway Patrol found Cunningham's 1998 Honda abandoned on Interstate 5 north of Yreka on Feb. 19, 2018. The car was impounded and when Camano Island deputies sent out a missing vehicle bulletin, the CHP said they had the car.

Deputies towed the Honda back to Washington and when they obtained a warrant to search it, they found the samurai sword wrapped in a blanket that appeared to be the same weapon used to kill the woman.

Testing of blood stains revealed Cunningham's DNA on the blade and Gonzales' DNA on the handle, the Island County Sheriff's Office said. That's when Gonzales went from a person of interest to Washington prosecutors filing murder charges against him.

The next break in the case came on April 7, 2018, when the Sutter County Sheriff's Office in California said a boater found a body in the Feather River near Yuba City. The body was identified as a John Doe since there was no identification, but deputies circulated pictures of two tattoos on the body.

In November, Island County detectives received tips about the tattoos possibly matching those on Gonzales. A DNA sample from the body was given to the state Department of Justice lab, but a second, larger sample needed to be sent, which led to the match between the body and Gonzales.

Wallace said the state Department of Justice would have to answer why it took a year for the body to be identified through DNA.

Following Cunningham's death, her family started a Facebook page titled Justice 4 Katherine. It has a photo of Katherine with the words, ""Help me find my Killer.""

The search for Gonzales ranged from Northern California to Los Banos and elsewhere in Merced County where authorities received tips that he may have been in hiding.

The Island County press release announcing the DNA results was posted Tuesday afternoon with users posting condolences and prayers for the family.

833,"Palm Springs 'carmageddon' on horizon: Projects begin at Indian Canyon, Gene Autry on Monday","CLOSE Northbound traffic on Gene Autry Trail waits on May 1 to turn left onto Vista Chino. A second turn lane will help prevent long lines of vehicles. Colin Atagi, DO NOT USE

Beginning Monday, anyone visiting Palm Springs should choose their routes wisely — unless they want to deal with traffic delays that could rival the ones caused by the Feb. 14 rainstorm that shut down roads across the desert.

The city will have its own ""carmageddon,"" which was the term used in 2011 when part of the 405 freeway shut down for construction in Los Angeles. Locally, road work is happening on parts of Indian Canyon and Gene Autry Trail and the latter may be ground zero for weeks of anger, frustration and headaches.

Here's what's on tap for the coming weeks.

The turn lane you want, but at a cost

A second left-turn lane is being installed on northbound Gene Autry Trail at Vista Chino to reduce the lines of waiting vehicles that often stretch beyond the turn pocket.

The new turn lane will replace the northern part of Gene Autry's left southbound lane. Once drivers pass the new turn lane, the left southbound lane will be available again.

Traffic control will be placed at the intersection beginning Monday and full construction will follow. But during construction, signals will be on flash mode — meaning four-way stops — and traffic will sometimes be reduced to one lane in all directions and left turns will be restricted from two directions.

Signals are expected to be on flash mode 24 hours per day through Tuesday or Wednesday, but major congestion is expected even after they began working as normal.

What you need to know

Anyone going west on Vista Chino (from Cathedral City) won't be allowed to turn left onto Gene Autry. And anyone going up Gene Autry (from Ramon Road) won't be able to turn left onto Vista Chino.

City staff suggests anyone coming from Cathedral City turn right onto Executive Drive (next to the strip mall) and go to Via Escuela. From there, turn left onto southbound Gene Autry.

Anyone heading north on Gene Autry should instead take Farrell Drive to the west. From Farrell, drivers can still turn left onto Vista Chino.

According to city staff, this is better than heading north on Gene Autry and passing Vista Chino before turning left onto westbound Via Escuela. Its speed limit is only 25 mph and there are speed humps to prevent reckless driving in the residential area.

Most construction is expected to be done by mid-June, but finishing touches won't be in place until the end of the month.

The wildcard closure

A windy day will be all the more reason to avoid Gene Autry and Vista Chino.

Indian Canyon Drive has been shutting down a lot lately due to blowing sand at the Whitewater Wash. On several occasions, closures have lasted for days.

According to the National Weather Service, high winds could be prevalent in Palm Springs through early July.

MORE: Pedestrian killed in Palm Desert identified as Desert Hot Springs man

Drivers have relied on Gene Autry Trail as an alternate route to Indian Canyon during closures. But with the turn-lane project happening, Gene Autry will hardly be the best route for anyone going into and out of Palm Springs.

Assistant City Manager Marcus Fuller said staff will coordinate with Caltrans or law enforcement officials if Indian Canyon shuts down while work takes place on Gene Autry.

Consider other options for when Indian Canyon shuts down. Possible routes include Highway 111 to the west and Date Palm and Bob Hope drives to the east.

The conversion finally begins

Work is finally beginning on Indian Canyon Drive to convert it into a two-way road between Alejo Road and Camino Parocela.

Intermittent lane closures are expected and city staff expects minor delays to occur at intersections where work is taking place.

There are currently four northbound lanes within the project site. But by the time work is done later this year, there will be two northbound lanes, one southbound lane and a center turn lane.

Street parking will be available whenever possible during construction, according to city staff.

MORE: Palm Springs DMV closes for six months due to renovations

MORE: Go here to report Riverside County traffic issues

Traffic signals will be renovated or replaced and sidewalks at most intersections will be expanded to make it easier for drivers to see pedestrians who are waiting to cross streets.

The project covers 1 mile passing through nine intersections.

What you need to know

Calle Encilia and Calle El Segundo to the east is open to traffic in both directions, but northbound traffic is reduced to one lane outside the Agua Caliente Casino on Encilia. Both roads only link Alejo and Ramon roads.

Further east is Avenida Caballeros, which links Ramon Road to Vista Chino. But be cautious since it passes through a residential area.

And over on Palm Canyon Drive

While work takes place on converting Indian Canyon, something else is happening one block away on Palm Canyon Drive.

Beginning Monday, crews will spend six weeks doing exploratory digging for traffic signal locations at all intersections between Ramon Road and Tachevah Drive.

They'll work in a north-to-south direction and each intersection will require two to three days of work, according to the city.

Intermittent lane closures and traffic delays are expected during the day.

New poles should be installed later this year or early next year.

835,Apartment manager caught on camera stealing from tenants in La Verne,"- Tonight, a community is shocked but also relieved after a suspected thief is behind bars accused of burglarizing their apartments -- That suspected thief -- their apartment manager.

When Suzy Wrate saw surveillance video from inside her apartment on her cell phone, she knew her suspicions were true.

""You see someone in your home, with a flashlight, going through papers on the table in drawers, looking in the curio cabinet and China cabinet,"" said Wrate.

Her Nest camera alerted her of someone in her home, catching the intruder inside for nearly 30 minutes rifling through her belongings. If that's not bad enough, she knew the intruder.

""It seems worse because it was someone I knew and not someone random,"" said Wrate.

Continue reading below

Wrate says that intruder was her apartment manager. La Verne Police say 69-year-old Dean May stole from his tenants--taking everything from jewelry to camping equipment. Wrate says she and neighbors always suspected May but never had any proof.

It was after her grandfather's Rolex watch went missing that she felt she needed a camera. The camera footage led to the arrest of May who now faces multiple burglary charges.

Neighbors say if it wasn't for the Wrate's camera, they would continue to be victimized by a man who they thought they could trust.

""I think he should be put away for a very long time. I don't think someone like him should be allowed to be out in the streets,"" Wrate said.

The Property owners sent a letter to tenants saying May has been terminated.

836,Family of Pearl Pinson wants to rename I-780 overpass in her honor,"VALLEJO (KRON) - It's been nearly three years since a Vallejo teen vanished without a trace.

The family of Pearl Pinson wants to do some special to honor her life and make sure she is never forgotten.

The overpass above Interstate 780 was the last place people saw the 15-year-old walking to school.

Witnesses say they saw her struggling with a man and then being dragged across the overpass, never to be seen again.

""Everyone in town knows this is Pearl's place,"" her sister, Rose Pinson said. ""This is Pearl's overpass and we want to make it official.""

In memory of the teen, there are fake flowers along the fence and graffiti along the walls, but her family wants something more permanent.

They want to rename the overpass after her.

Pinson's family has started a petition to show the community's support and it has garnered hundreds of signatures.

Rose Pinson told KRON4's Justine Waldman, a renaming project would need the city and Caltrans approval and cost $6,000, but her family says it is important to make it happen.

""So everybody knows what happened to her and how to prevent it from happening to someone else,"" her sister said.

The Solano County Sheriff's Office is always following up on any tips that come in, but detectives say there has been no new information on Pinson's disappearance.

Police killed her alleged abductor in a shootout in Southern California and likely any clues may have died with him.

May 25 will mark the 3 years since Pinson went missing.

A man whose passion for local government grew out of a high school requirement to do community service in Laverne will be Indian Wells’ new city manager.

Chris Freeland of Rancho Cucamonga, who worked 18 years for West Covina, where he was city manager for the last 3½ years, will take the helm at City Hall on May 13.

The City Council unanimously approved a five-year contract with Freeland on Thursday, with a starting base salary of $230,000 plus benefits.

“It’s a great community. Whether it be the tennis tournaments, the beautiful resorts, it’s a destination here in the valley,” Freeland said, and a community with a positive reputation statewide.

“I’m fortunate to join such a talented city team and look forward to building upon the many successes already accomplished by the council and staff,” Freeland said.

The City Council contracted with the recruitment firm Teri Black & Co. in its search for a city manager after Wade McKinney announced his retirement in November after six years with the city. His last day is May 11.

Freeland’s base salary is less than McKinney’s current salary of $242,401.08 but falls in line with most other city manager salaries in the valley.

Mayor Ted Mertens said the city received 65 applications and the recruiter narrowed it to 12 of the most qualified to serve Indian Wells. From that dozen, the council chose five to interview.

“He has a well-rounded background,” Mertens said. “We found a city manager with a track record of innovative work in the community he served for more than 18 years. He is a respected public servant who will bring a tremendous amount of skill and transparency to the city manager position.”

In West Covina, Freeland had worked in nearly every management role, including human human resources director, community services director and deputy city attorney. He was appointed city manager in September 2015 and resigned in March after a new majority was elected to the city council.

They wanted to seat their own leader, Freeland said, which is not uncommon in municipal government.

West Covina has been struggling financially for several years and he and the new council didn’t agree on the best way to address a projected multimillion-dollar deficit for 2019-20.

“One of the things I was working on is trying to address the pension liability,” he said, which was rising by about $2 million per year.

“Coming into a community that doesn’t have those financial challenges ... is wonderful,” he said, and it means the city can focus on providing the “best quality services.”

“I’m really appreciative of their fiscal conservancy here,” Freeland said of Indian Wells.

The two cities are vastly different in many ways: West Covina’s population is about 112,000, while Indian Wells’ population is about 5,200. West Covina’s median age is 37.4, while Indian Wells’ is 68.5. The median household income in West Covina is about $74,551 and in Indian Wells it is about $103,516.

Each city presents different challenges, Freeland said.

Indian Wells is a tourism-driven community. About 65 percent of the city’s general fund revenue last year was from hotel and sales taxes as well as admission tax on tickets for the BNP Paribas Open Tennis Tournament.

A challenge in Indian Wells is focusing on the resort communities and making sure they are prospering, Freeland said.

The city is also looking forward to what will develop with the Delano Resort concept, which is planned to bring a five-story, 139-room luxury hotel, 31 villas and 54 condos to a vacant lot neighboring the tennis garden on Highway 111.

It is the first new major development in Indian Wells in several years.

Making sure the city does all it can to help the developer get through the permitting and approval processes as smoothly as possible is a priority, he said.

Another priority is working with staff and the property owner of The Village at Indian Wells shopping center to get the long-vacant Ralphs building filled, he said.

“That’s a hard space to fill,” he said.

Mertens said Freeland’s experience will help Indian Wells formulate a plan for its affordable-housing properties.

In addition to his senior leadership experience, Freeland has been active and involved in his community, which is equally important, Mertens said.

A good fit

In talking to others who know Freeland and his work in West Covina, Mertens said he received favorable comments.

“Overall, Chris was very well thought of,” Mertens said. “I think he will be a good fit for the city.”

West Covina Mayor Lloyd Johnson said he has known Freeland for about 15 years and called him “a very good leader. If there were any issues, he would get all the information before he would make any determination on the outcome.”

“He had a very good work ethic,” said Johnson, who was the only council member to vote against accepting Freeland’s resignation. “Our situation we are in had nothing to do with Chris Freeland’s city’ ability as a city manager.”

Problems the city is facing were handed down to Freeland, and he had some good ideas to help get the city back on track, Johnson said.

They were “challenges he was trying to correct from predecessors … and with a new council, expecting great changes in a very short time period,” Johnson said. “It would have been a very big challenge to any city manager.”

“Chris was very involved in all city functions. Even on his days off, he made it a point to show up and be involved,” Johnson added. “You won’t find another city manager who will work as hard as Chris will. He will spend as many hours as it takes to accomplish the goals the city council is looking for. He will work very closely with city council and he will tell them exactly what they need to hear so the city will prosper.”

Born in West Covina and raised in Laverne, Freeland developed an immediate passion for local government when a high school community service requirement took him to City Hall, where he worked with the city manager.

After putting in 101 volunteer hours, he was offered a paid internship, Freeland said.

He has bachelor’s degrees in civil engineer and political science from Cal Poly Pomona and a master’s degree in public administration from California State University, Long Beach.

From college he went to work for the city of West Covina. He and his wife have been married 14 years and she is an attorney in San Bernardino.

They are not strangers to Indian Wells, having visited numerous times to vacation, play golf and attend the BNP Paribas Open.

They will move to the Coachella Valley, though haven’t yet found a place. He drives a fully restored 1966 Mustang which he has had since he was 16 and is “a huge Dodgers baseball fan. I can proudly say I have been to every Major League Baseball stadium.”

“Personally, I think we’re lucky to get you,” Mayor Pro Tem Ty Peabody said.

864,Family of man killed in Bay Area crash files lawsuit against Tesla,"Family of man killed in Bay Area crash files lawsuit against Tesla Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Video

SAN FRANCISCO (KRON) - The family of a man who was killed in a car crash while driving his Tesla in Mountain View a year ago has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Tesla.

In a statement released on Wednesday, the family's lawyers said ""errors by Tesla's Autopilot navigation system caused the crash that killed Walter Huang of Foster City, Calif., last year.""

Huang, who was 38-years-old when he died March 23, 2018, was driving his 2017 Tesla Model X on the ""autopilot"" feature in Mountain View when he crashed into the edge of a concrete highway median that was missing its crash guard.

According to the law firm, the Tesla's Autopilot feature was ""defective"" and resulted in Huang's death.

""The navigation system of Huang’s Tesla misread the lane lines on the roadway, failed to detect the concrete median, and failed to brake the car, but instead accelerated the car into the median,"" the statement read.

The allegations against Tesla include product liability, defective product design, failure to warn, breach of warranty, intentional and negligent misrepresentation, and false advertising.

The lawsuit also names the State of California Department of Transportation as a defendant.

871,Murders of 2 California women in 1970s linked to dead inmate from Fresno,"SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. -- DNA evidence has linked the cold-case rape and murder of two women in California's Central Coast to a man who died of cancer in a Washington prison nearly four decades after the killings, authorities said Wednesday.DNA taken from an old razor belonging to Arthur Rudy Martinez recently matched DNA left by the suspect in two unsolved killings in Atascadero in the late 1970s, San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson said at a news conference.The body of 30-year-old Jane Morton Antunez was found in the back seat of her car on a dirt road on Nov. 18, 1977. She had been sexually assaulted, and her throat had been cut. Less than two months later, 28-year-old Patricia Dwyer was found sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her home on Jan. 11, 1978.Martinez moved to Washington from Atascadero shortly after Dwyer was killed. He later was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of numerous rapes and robberies in Washington, but Martinez escaped from prison in 1994, Parkinson said.Martinez returned to California and lived in Fresno under an alias for more than 20 years. He turned himself in on his Washington convictions after getting diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2014 so he could get medical treatment in prison, Parkinson said.He died just about two months later at the age of 65 in the prison in Spokane.At the time of the murders, Martinez was working as a welder in Atascadero and was on parole for convictions of attempted murder and rape. At one point, he had been considered as a potential suspect in the killings, but there was no evidence at the time linking him to either crime scene, Parkinson said.The sheriff's office reopened the 41-year-old cold case in 2017 and decided to test Martinez's DNA after one of his family members was connected to the case through a familial DNA search, the sheriff's office said.""Our hearts go out to the families of the victims and are hopeful the resolution to these cases brings them some closure,"" Parkinson said in a statement.",https://abc30.com/murders-of-2-california-women-in-1970s-linked-to-dead-inmate-from-fresno/5258271/,2019-04-18T18:41:54Z,ABC30 Fresno,Couple,"1777 G St, Fresno, CA 93706, USA",CA,93706

Officers also confiscated two dead bobcats and a taxidermied mountain lion. A Northern California man illegally shot more than 130 hawks and other birds of prey on his land, leaving the carcasses to pile up at the foot of trees and telephone poles, wildlife officials said Wednesday.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A Northern California man has been sentenced to 90 days in jail after pleading guilty to killing more than 150 protected birds and other wildlife.

California Department of Fish and Wildlife officials call it the largest raptor poaching case in known California history.

State prosecutors said Friday that 68-year-old Richard Parker of Standish also agreed to pay $75,000 in fines after pleading guilty to crimes related to poaching.

The two firearms that Parker used to shoot the wildlife were ordered destroyed by the court.

Wildlife officers began investigating Parker last March after receiving a tip by someone who saw a man kill a hawk near the town of Standish, 135 miles northeast of Sacramento.

When they searched Parker's property, officers found 159 dead animals, most of them red-tailed hawks but also two bobcats and a mountain lion.

881,CBS47 Investigates: Special needs child missing from school for over an hour,"CBS47 Investigates: Special needs child missing from school for over an hour Video

FRESNO, California - The mother of a special needs child is demanding answers from the Fresno Unified School District, after her daughter went missing from school for over an hour.

Naica Cavazos says she was was never notified and neither was law enforcement.

The incident happened Thursday morning at Ayer Elementary School in southeast Fresno.

Cavazos says, ""They all failed. It is their responsibility not only to teach my child, but to keep her safe and make sure she stays on school grounds.""

Cavazos says from 11:45 am to 1:15 pm school officials were searching the campus.

Cavazos says it all began Thursday morning after dropping her daughter, 11-year-old Lauryn off at school.

She tells CBS47 she ran to a few places and only went home to wait for a maintenance man to fix the air conditioner.

She says it was 11:45 am.

The she heard a knock at the door, it was her daughter.

""She was screaming, she was crying, she was hysterical,"" says Cavazos.

Cavazos says after calming her daughter down and waiting for the crew to finish their work, it was 1:15 pm.

She says during the entire time, she never got a call from the school.

So she drove to the school and kept Lauryn in the car.

She walked inside and asked school officials, where's my daughter?

Cavazos said she was told the principal and vice-principal were in a meeting and she spoke with another school official.

""She asked me how do I know Lauryn is missing? I said I have her in my car. She said let me get someone you can talk too,"" says Cavazos.

Cavazos then spoke with the principal.



""She said she's aware of the situation and according to her staff members, they were actually looking for her on the school grounds,"" says Cavazos.

But an hour and half later?

Plus not notifying parents or police that a child is missing?

In an emailed statement to CBS47, Fresno Unified admits in this instance, ""There was a breakdown in the site's protocols and as a result, parents were not notified in a timely manner.""

Public Information Officer, Vanessa Ramirez says, ""School site administration conducted an investigation and gaps have been identified and addressed with staff to ensure yesterdays missteps are not repeated.""

Cavazos says she has talked to her daughter about never leaving school again.

So what does Fresno Unified do if a student comes up missing?

Ramirez says, ""In the event a student is reported missing from their classroom staff immediately contacts administration and support staff and an on campus search is initiated. Bathrooms, the library, playgrounds and other classrooms are searched. In the event the student is not located, staff contacts local law enforcements along with the District's Communication office who deploys safety support. Parents are also contacted. In the event parents cannot be reached, a school staff member makes a home visit.""

885,Love One Another: Mayor's Prayer Breakfast focuses on love and unity Thursday,"With plenty of struggles and challenges in the country — many, at times, close to home — this year’s National Day of Prayer shared an important message for the community to remember during these troubled times: love one another.

At the Mayor’s Prayer Breakfast Thursday morning, community leaders and members packed Desert Christian Center to hear that message while also taking time to pray for local, state and national leaders.

Larry Bird served as the master of ceremonies, Kiwanis President Wayne Silva led the audience in the pledge of allegiance, Becky Garcia sang the National Anthem, and Brooke Cope from Fellowship of Christian Athletes gave the invocation. Desert Christian Center Pastor David Schad led the audience in song, then Reverend Wesley B. Elmore from United Methodist Church gave a prayer for dignitaries. After the speeches, Schad led the audience in the singing of “God Bless America,” then closed the event out with a benediction.

Ridgecrest Mayor Peggy Breeden shared a message of love and understanding among the community, encouraging those in attendance to show love and understanding toward each other.

“As prayer warriors, pray for us, pray for ourselves, and pray for our community — that’s all I ask — with love, respect, determination and, most of all, understanding,” she said. “Because even though we may disagree on things, we can find paths that take us to the end.

“We are a community. We live as a community. And, you know what? Some of us will die as a community. If we don’t, the community will die.”

Speaking from a leadership perspective, Breeden touched on the role of local leaders in raising the community.

“We have to remember what each of us needs, what each of us wants, and how we achieve that,” she said. “Not through condemnation, not through arguments. But through listening, thinking and understanding in our heart, because we have a job to do and that is to serve all. No matter what you believe, no matter what you think, we are elected to serve you.”

Breeden closed her remarks by asking those in attendance “to say love is the reason we are here, because we are community.”

Ralph Neighbour III delivered the keynote address, which he titled “Pray Big or Go Home,” in which he referenced The Prayer of Jabez, an Old Testament (First Chronicles) prayer of prosperity that has seen contemporary popularity.

Prefacing his speech, Neighbour, from Clovis, briefly talked about his drive to Ridgecrest.

“I believe that Ridgecrest is a diamond tucked away in California. I seriously believe that,” he said to applause. “It’s hard to get here, right? And it’s hard to leave. … God has given you something very, very special.”

As the story goes, Jabez — which means “pain” in Old Hebrew, despite being “more honorable” than his brothers — cried out to God for blessings, territory enlargement, and avoidance of evil.

Neighbour tied the prayer in situations in which he — and, hypothetically, the audience — would need to cry out for help.

“There are those moments when, in desperation, you cry out and you say, ‘Something’s got to change.’ That’s exactly what happened here,” he said.

The abruptness of the prayer in the Bible — it came in the middle of a genealogical rundown — gives weight to its importance. Neighbour suggested that the prayer was said very publicly and profoundly.

“I don’t know too many quotes that we quote 3,000 years later,” he said. “But this prayer was one that was etched, and it caused the writer of Chronicles to stop and say that at this moment in history, this man made a difference.”

The prayer is often criticized among different religious philosophies as being selfish, but Neighbour suggested that it was actually selfless, as he was praying for his community.

“The ‘why’ in life, I believe, is the most important thing you can answer,” he said. “If you don’t know why you’re doing it, if you don’t know why you’re in the position you’re in … you’ll go down very, very fast. Jabez was more honorable. He wanted to run to the fight, not run from the fight.”

To illustrate, Neighbour shared a story about his time in Chino, California, where he started a church. Over time, as he built a congregation, he often met with city leaders. The city’s mayor at the time became an early parishioner and later cited a need for spiritual leadership to help her become a community leader.

“Servant leaders are very strong,” Neighbour said. “Jabez knew how to go to war, and he was ready to go to war, and sometimes that’s what needed in order to keep peace in the family.”

In closing, Neighbour tied the stories into his main point: leaders should be strong, and if not, then someone else should lead.

“If you are not willing to fight, go home,” he said.

“If you are not willing to fight for your church, go home.

“If you are not willing to fight for your schools, go home.

“If you are not willing to fight for your city, go home.

“If you’re not willing to fight for your state, go home.

“If you’re not willing to fight for your country, go home.”",https://www.ridgecrestca.com/news/20190503/love-one-another-mayors-prayer-breakfast-focuses-on-love-and-unity-thursday?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T20:08:59Z,Ridgecrest Daily Independent,Couple,"224 E Ridgecrest Blvd, Ridgecrest, CA 93555, USA",CA,93555

Visalia police officers are responding to reports of a stabbing in a neighborhood near several northeast Visalia schools.

Dispatchers began receiving calls just before 1:30 p.m. of a stabbing at a home on Manzanita Street near Pershing Avenue.

The caller reported that a man had been stabbed in the lower back.

Police have arrested at least one person related to the stabbing and may be looking for additional witnesses.

Police also reported a single gunshot heard in the area, but don't believe the two are related.

Tulare County sheriff's deputies are helping search near the St. John's River for where the shot may have originated.

889,Suspect who led police on chase from Laguna to Newport has 'extensive criminal history',"- A parolee wanted on a no-bail warrant led police on a chase Wednesday, starting in Laguna Beach and leading to Newport Beach, where he barricaded himself inside the Mercedes-Benz he had been driving.

After a 45-minute standoff, the suspect got out of the car just before 5 p.m. and was taken into custody.

The chase started about 3 p.m. in Laguna Beach when the suspect, who was reported to be armed with a gun, refused to yield in an attempted vehicle stop, Laguna Beach Police Department Sgt. Jim Cota said.

The suspect, later identified as 53-year-old Newport Beach resident Richard Bloustine, has an ""extensive criminal history'' of white collar and violent crimes, including a conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, Cota said.

The man was on the phone with dispatchers from his Mercedes-Benz at some point during the chase, Cota said.

He eventually pulled into a parking lot at an office complex in Newport Beach at 1441 Avocado Ave. near Fashion Island and remained in the car with police monitoring him at gunpoint.

It was unclear if a gun was recovered.

Bloustine was convicted in 2016 of writing bad checks totaling more than $200,000.

In 1996, he was convicted of credit card fraud in Hawaii, and three years later was found guilty of a fraud scheme in Arizona.

In 2004, he was convicted of grand theft, and in 2008, he was convicted again of grand theft and credit card fraud. Both of those cases were in Santa Barbara County.

905,The Kid with the Golden Arm,"CHINO, Calif. — His right arm can throw a football 85 yards, has made him the consensus top quarterback recruit in the country and has earned him comparisons to Cam Newton. It can also throw a baseball 95 miles per hour and has inspired MLB scouts to say he reminds them of a young Roger Clemens.

But on this Friday night in February, DJ Uiagalelei's right arm is doing neither. Doctor's orders.

The junior from St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower, California, has been asked to avoid throwing a football, a baseball, anything, as he recovers from surgery to repair a torn tendon in his left (non-throwing) middle finger. A spring that was supposed to be occupied with football and baseball has been temporarily derailed.

So instead, wearing gym clothes as he sits on his family room couch, he scrolls through a Twitter feed that doesn't care about where his right arm is right now or the status of his middle finger—as long as it doesn't get in the way of seemingly limitless future.

The speculation there is endless. And it will be until he commits to a college on May 5. Clemson, Oregon and Mt. San Antonio College (where his uncles coach) are the finalists, he announced Wednesday, but he's also been offered by Alabama, USC, Ohio State, Michigan, on and on.

And when he picks a college, it will only begin the next wave of speculation. Football or baseball?

Former Oklahoma quarterback and center fielder Kyler Murray has recalibrated the definition of the two-sport athlete, having been selected by the Oakland A's in the top 10 in the 2018 MLB draft and now by the Arizona Cardinals No. 1 overall in the 2019 NFL draft. Uiagalelei could follow in his footsteps.

Why not?

""I want to play both sports in college,"" Uiagalelei tells B/R. ""I really would like to play football and baseball as long as I can. If I get lucky enough to be able to play Major League Baseball or in the NFL, that would be a blessing.""

His right arm is opening the doors. Uiagalelei just needs to choose which ones to walk through.

DJ isn't the only Uiagalelei blessed with remarkable genetics. His younger brother, Matayo, who is still in eighth grade, has multiple football scholarship offers of his own, including ones from LSU and USC. At 6'4"" and 225 pounds, Matayo is on track to be one of the most coveted tight ends or defensive players in the country when his time comes.

For as big as the brothers already are, they live in the shadow of their father, David Uiagalelei, a 394-pound mountain of a man with the smile and personality to match.

In high school, David—who is now known around Southern California as ""Big Dave""—went by the nickname ""Halftime Show."" His ability to uncork spectacular dunks at more than 300 pounds was widely celebrated, although these moments never came during actual games. They came during halftimes and intermissions, when he was often in street clothes, ineligible to play to suit up because of his grades.

""I was what you might call a troubled kid in high school,"" David says. ""I didn't like school. I didn't follow the rules. I always thought I could get away with things because of my athletic ability.

""I made sure both of my sons were nothing like me.""

David turned his comic book physique into a career. For more than a decade, he traveled the world with Chris Brown, T-Pain, DJ Khaled and other popular musicians as a personal bodyguard.

But in 2010, when DJ was nine, he began to question why his father was never around. So David abandoned his lucrative profession for a job as a resource officer at his former high school, Ganesha High in Pomona, California—the very place his own enormous athletic potential was never realized.

David knew early on that things would be different for DJ, who liked school and avoided the setbacks that he could not. When Indiana offered him a scholarship in sixth grade, David knew it was just the beginning, even if DJ didn't understand what the offer meant. Before he threw a single pass at Bosco, DJ had five scholarship offers in hand.

Having never enjoyed a recruitment of his own, David has embraced the hysteria.

""This guy, he's a social butterfly,"" his wife, Tausha Uiagalelei, says. ""He can talk to anybody.""

On occasion, David and DJ will clash about what the former shares on social media or the things he says, but the two mostly see eye to eye. And when it comes to the games themselves, David has removed himself of all influence and direction with the coaches.

""I'm not trying to be the next LaVar Ball,"" he says. ""I'm just enjoying every minute of this and helping my son make the decision that is right for him.""

In the past five years, Jason Negro has coached two once-in-a-lifetime high school quarterbacks. The luxury is not lost on Bosco's head football coach, who sits behind his desk in his spacious football office while preparing for another camp.

To his right, a handful of framed football jerseys of former Bosco players hang on the wall. The most notable is Josh Rosen, who committed to UCLA as the nation's No. 1 quarterback recruit in 2015 and was selected by the Cardinals 10th overall in the 2018 NFL draft.

Years from now, Uiagalelei will have his own space on the wall.

""I think they're both going to be amazing NFL players,"" Negro says of his former and current quarterbacks. ""I know that's saying a lot about where I believe DJ is going. But if he continues to trend in this direction, I don't see him being anything less than what Josh is.""

Over the past two seasons, Uiagalelei has accounted for 87 touchdowns (77 passing) and has thrown only nine interceptions. He's also lost only two games—both to fellow California powerhouse Mater Dei.

""He has generational arm talent,"" says Barton Simmons, director of scouting for 247Sports. ""It's certainly one of the strongest arms we've ever scouted.""

This past season, 16 out of 32 seniors at Bosco signed with Division I programs. Even for a school that regularly pumps out Division I prospects, it was a historic year. Amid the surplus of talent all over the field, though, Uiagalelei is approaching a threshold few ever have.

As a result, the coaching staff is doing everything in its power to protect its prized asset—denying almost every interview request and treating him the way a college or NFL team treats its stars.

""He has a four-year window to make the best of high school, and we certainly don't want all these external forces clouding that up,"" Negro says. ""Right now, everyone wants a piece.""

While his recruitment has finally slowed with the potential suitors more clearly defined, there was a stretch when Uiagalelei says he was receiving scholarships daily. The number of offers is so robust that he laughs at the thought of keeping track.

247Sports, which has Uiagalelei as the No. 3 overall recruit in the 2020 class, lists 30 major programs as having made offers. Rivals, which has him at No. 1 overall, lists 32. Both have him as a 5-star prospect and the top quarterback in the class, and both predict he'll commit to Clemson.

""I honestly think a year or two from where he's at now, he could be one of the 32 guys starting in the NFL,"" Negro adds. ""As long as he stays healthy and continues down this career path, he's gonna be a top-five or top-10 pick.""

Before this spring, it had been more than four years since Uiagalelei actually pitched. As a freshman, he played the outfield to conserve his arm. Last season, he skipped baseball entirely.

This season, Uiagalelei pitched in two scrimmages, showing flashes of his potential before he suffered his finger injury. His fastball, his favorite pitch, sits in the low to mid-90s. His arsenal of off-speed pitches, headlined by a curveball and a slider, have bite despite having been mostly dormant for years.

Bosco head baseball coach Don Barbara had long waited to see these flashes.

""It really was unbelievable,"" Barbara says. ""I don't think it would take him that long to get to the big leagues. Not with his arm and not with his curveball. ...

""I hear from agents and from scouts. There are a lot of people interested in him. If that guy was pitching right now, the stadium would be filled. It's crazy.""

Barbara is not the only one who has heard from interested parties. Some of baseball's most prominent agents have reached out to David, trying to gauge how baseball may or may not fit into his son's future plans.

Given all of DJ's time away from pitching, it might come as a surprise that he'd create such an impression so quickly. But not to DJ himself.

""I've probably played more baseball than football in my life,"" he says. ""Growing up, I played all year long. I wanted to be a baseball player.""

Murray's decision to spurn baseball for football could ultimately impact whether a Major League Baseball team feels strongly enough about DJ to draft him next season, if it were to come to that.

What has become clear, through the uncertainty and the speculation and the regular check-ins, is that his arm and size are too tantalizing not to pursue.

It's mid-March, and the middle finger of his left hand is now covered by a glove. Underneath his mitt, his wrist is heavily wrapped, and the middle finger is taped to his ring finger for support. Doctors advised Uiagalelei to rest his finger for a full three months. But after only two months and nowhere close to 100 percent healed, he wanted to return to the mound.

His fastball sits in the low 90s in his regular-season debut against Orange Lutheran. Although he walks a batter and gives up a run in his return, the fact it is even happening sparks more intrigue. The question isn't how good Uiagalelei will be when he is finally healed, but what a finished, polished version of the pitcher could look like sometime down the line.

Whether that time will ever come remains to be seen. Scouts and recruiting analysts believe football is his ultimate destination. But Uiagalelei still hopes to play both as long as he possibly can.

Despite their differences in size and style, Uiagalelei intently observed how Murray navigated his way between the two sports.

""He got drafted in the first round for baseball, but I feel like people didn't know how big of a deal it was until he started showing how good he was in football,"" Uiagalelei says. ""I felt like he could've had a lot more leverage a lot earlier in his situation.""

Money and security unquestionably complicate any decision. Murray got a $4.66 million signing bonus from the A's.

""I mean, I'm still in high school,"" Uiagalelei says. ""It's a whole different story with me and Kyler Murray. I'm just trying to play both sports right now, and there's a lot of people who are trying to do that.""

Soon, Uiagalelei will announce his college destination of choice, likely altering the landscape of college football over the next 3-4 years. He then intends to turn his attention to recruiting, hoping to attract more young talent to the program he chooses.

Along the way, he will continue to pitch. At least that's the plan right now. Not because he's worried about draft stock or the millions of dollars that could be just a year away or the pressure to grow into the next great two-sport star—a supersized encore to the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL draft.

But because for much of his life, he's known no other way.

908,How one of America’s smallest Indian tribes bounced back from the brink of dying out,"Photos and video by Omar Ornelas | Video produced by Vickie Connor | Published May 2, 2019

Share This Story Tweet Share Share Pin Email

Amanda Vance, the 32-year-old tribal chair of the Augustine Band of Cahuilla Indians, on a recent weekday settled in for a long afternoon of meetings in the double-wide trailers that make up the tribe’s government buildings.

Flanked by photos of her ancestors, including her late mother, Mary Ann Martin, Vance listened carefully to a presentation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, whose representatives outlined options to the tribal council for the reservation's water-treatment system ahead of the planned start of construction on permanent government offices.

Vance leads a tribe of 12 — seven adults and five children — that, 30 years ago, was in danger of vanishing after its enrollment dwindled to just one person by the mid-1980s. Her mother almost single-handedly rebuilt the tribe, transforming its barren 500 acres of land on the edge of the eastern Coachella Valley from a popular site for illegal dumping to an expanding reservation that employs more than 400 people through its gaming commission, tribal government and the popular Augustine Casino, a no-frills neighborhood spot frequented by farmworkers and snowbirds.

In a move toward self-sufficiency, Martin also led the planning of a 3-megawatt solar farm that opened in 2008, the first solar project of its kind by a Southern California tribe approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The renewable energy project helps power the 30,000-square-foot casino, which features 800 slot machines and eight card tables and sits at Avenue 54 and Van Buren Street.

In the coming months, the tribe will open a 33-acre organic farm called Temalpakh, the Cahuilla word for ""From the Earth."" Through a dedicated farmer's market and education building, the farm will showcase sustainable, organic farming practices and will provide vegetables and other crops for the community to enjoy.

For decades, the story of the Augustine tribe had been shrouded in myth and lore, attracting national attention in the 1990s when Martin, who once constituted the only adult member of the tribe, moved ahead with plans to open the casino.

Martin and her brothers grew up in Monrovia and lived with the black side of their family and had only a vague awareness of their Native heritage. But after learning more from family on their mother's side, they discovered their lineal connection to Captain Vee-Vee Augustine, the namesake of the Augustine Band, and enrolled in the tribe in 1988.

“There was very little of our tribe, our land or our legacy.” Amanda Vance, Augustine Band of Cahuilla Indians tribal chair

Tragedystruck a few years later. In 1994, brothers Gregory and Herbert were killed in a gang shooting in Banning, leaving only Martin, who had been chosen to serve as tribal chair by her siblings, to forge ahead with plans to develop the reservation, while raising her young children.

""It wasn’t long ago that our tribe was struggling for its very existence,"" Vance said at a luncheon last fall when the Augustines released their first-ever community impact report. Many of those gathered included local elected leaders, heads of nonprofit organizations and other guests. ""There was very little of our tribe, our land or our legacy.""

The oldest of Martin's children, Vance became tribal chair in 2016, about a year before her mother succumbed to cancer in January 2017. In carrying on the work her mother started, Vance has adopted her mother's characteristic grit and drive, but she has stepped into her own leadership style, carving out a far more public role than her mother, who was notoriously shy about publicity.

“People are starting to notice our small tribe and our accomplishments, which are not so small,"" Vance said in November. ""We believe it is time for the Augustine Band of Cahuilla Indians to step out of the shadows and to tell our story.""

The Augustines' history

In the mid-1800s, federal records showed a Native population numbering in the thousands across 22 villages, including Cahuilla Village, which would later be recognized as the Augustine reservation by Congress in 1891. Disease brought by white settlers — smallpox, tuberculosis and pneumonia — would soon decimate the Native population. By 1951, there were only 11 remaining members of the Augustine tribe.

The tribe's dwindling population during the 1900s was typical for Southern California tribes, said history professor Clifford Trafzer, Rupert Costo Chair in American Indian Affairs at the University of California, Riverside.

Roberta Augustine, shown here in an undated photo, died in 1987 and was the last enrolled member of the tribe before her children, Mary Ann, Herbert and Gregory Martin, enrolled in the tribe in 1988.

During the 1900s, ""a lot of people left reservations,"" Trafzer said. ""There wasn’t a whole lot of work, so the family might have moved during World War II for defense work in the Los Angeles area.""

Other members also likely left, later marrying and losing their connections to their tribal lands, he said. ""People probably left Augustine to go work elsewhere,"" he said. ""They worked agriculture throughout the Coachella Valley and all the way to San Manuel to work in the citrus.""

Roberta Augustine, who was born in 1937, was the last enrolled member before she died in 1987. She had four children, including Martin and her brothers.

When Augustine was a young woman, she lived with relatives on the Morongo Indian Reservation before eventually leaving with a man, with whom she had a child that was put up for adoption, according to a 1998 Riverside Press-Enterprise article.

Augustine later met Martin's father, Herman Grady John Martin, an African American man with whom she had three children, including Gregory and Herbert. The family, including Augustine, lived in Monrovia.

A month before she died, a 1987 article in The Desert Sun reported on a dispute involving a Monrovia social worker named Josephine Anderson and a man named Howard McZeal. Both claimed to be Augustine's conservator and sought information about her from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the article said.

Anderson told the newspaper that for months, with the help of an attorney, she looked for Augustine, hoping she could be tracked down to be served with a court subpoena in Anderson's bid to be appointed conservator.

Anderson died in 2002 and McZeal in 2008, according to public records.

Arlene Lacy, 73, a former real estate specialist at the bureau, said in a phone interview that she remembered the dispute over conservatorship, but could not recall Anderson's or McZeal's names specifically.

According to the 1987 article, Lacy did not release any information about Augustine to McZeal because he could not produce any documentation for his claim.

At stake potentially was 350 acres in the tribe's name and 160 acres of Augustine's personal property, according to the report. A leasing arrangement for a commercial shopping center could have earned her as much as $3.5 million over 20 years, the article said. Other tribes were also interested in potentially acquiring the land, the report said.

Without any other enrolled tribal members, the land could have reverted back to the federal government and ""would not go to her children (Martin and her siblings) because they are not registered members of the tribe and their whereabouts are not immediately known,"" an unnamed bureau spokeswoman in Riverside said at the time.

The names of Anderson and McZeal do not ring familiar to members of the tribe today. Vance said Augustine was with family up until the time of her death. Because much of the tribe was born after 1986, they have no direct knowledge of some aspects of Augustine's history, making it difficult to verify some of her biographical details.

But what is true is that in 1988, armed with knowledge of their genealogy, Martin and her brothers re-established the tribe, forming the tribal council and setting in motion economic-development plans.

Mary Ann Martin's drive

It's hard to overstate the learning curve and challenges Martin faced in the decade that preceded the opening of the Augustine Casino in 2002.

Not only did Martin raise her young children — Amanda, Ronnie and William — following the deaths of her brothers, but she had to quickly learn about how to create and administer a tribal government, set up an economic-development plan and eventually, negotiate a gaming compact with Gov. Gray Davis' administration — all while coming to terms with her Native identity.

Because the tribe is of mixed Native and black heritage, Vance said she often was met with perplexed looks by non-Native people. “We're usually criticized for what we look like,” Vance said. “We don't look Native.""

With the guidance of relatives in other tribes, Martin and her children began reconnecting with the history of their tribe and its customs and traditions. ""We learned from elders (in other tribes),"" Vance said. ""It wasn't straight from our elders because my grandmother had passed away, so we kind of used the different tribes around us to get that information, that history and that knowledge.""

Mary Ann Martin was tribal chair from 1988 until 2016. She led the development of the tribe's Augustine Casino, a 3-megawatt solar farm and the soon-to-open organic farm. Martin was instrumental in the survival of the tribe, whose enrollment had dwindled to one by the mid-1980s.

In the beginning, Martin's to-do list would appear endless, but the first task would prove to be the most consequential: find trustworthy, experienced advisers.

Martin's position reflected the realities for many Southern California tribal leaders, UC Riverside's Trafzer said. ""A lot of people had not gotten much education, not much in high school, maybe a high school degree, but not many college grads,"" he said of tribal leaders who would need to rely on consultants to develop casinos and other businesses on their reservations. ""They might not have a degree in business or marketing.""

Karen Kupcha, 70, was the Augustine's first — and, so far, only — tribal administrator. Kupcha, who over the years became Martin's confidant and one of her closest friends, most recalls Martin's fierce dedication to her family — and how receptive she was to mastering the intricacies of tribal politics and government.

""What an incredible woman,"" Kupcha recalled. ""Here she is with three small children and she was open to learning. She was high energy and always on the go.""

In the early years, she attended meetings with other tribes, as well as training in all aspects of government administration. She established rules, regulations, policies and other procedures. She also developed plans for education, health care and housing, but those programs would cost money and the reservation would need to start generating revenue.

At Kupcha's recommendation, Martin in the late 1990s hired a former housing official who served during Gov. Jerry Brown's first administration, Paul Turner. Now 73, the Harvard graduate had had a storied career, once working as deputy director of California's housing and urban development agency in the 1970s before later working in China. He first met Kupcha while working on an economic-development project with a tribe in Washington state.

At the tribe's behest, Turner conducted a market feasibility study, which ultimately recommended that a casino would be the most lucrative venture, even if it was an option Martin initially opposed because of concerns about how gambling can harm communities.

""Mary Ann and I were concerned about how it would affect the culture of the tribe,"" Turner recalled. ""Some other tribes have had pretty rough histories with their casino-fueled cultures.""

The political landscape was quickly shifting, too.

The late 1990s and early 2000s saw a flurry of activity as California tribes, among them the Agua Caliente, Morongo Band of Mission Indians and the Pechanga tribe near Temecula, negotiated compacts with the state allowing Vegas-style casino games.

The compacts would require voter approval. The first attempt came in the form of Proposition 5, a 1998 initiative overwhelmingly approved by voters. But the victory was short-lived.

The California Supreme Court ruled the initiative unconstitutional, largely on technical terms because the ballot measure only changed state statute without repealing language from a 1984 constitutional amendment that banned ""casinos of the type currently operating in Nevada and New Jersey.""

Voters two years later approved Proposition 1A, a constitutional amendment that officially established the rights of tribes to operate slot machines and other forms of gaming. The Augustine compact with Davis' administration was signed in March 2000.

The early 2000s also brought a string of newspaper articles, and editorials — including one from The Desert Sun's Editorial Board — questioning whether a tribe with a single adult member should operate a casino.

In a 2002 series by Time magazine, authored by the award-winning investigative duo of Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele about the spread of tribal gaming across the country, the opening anecdote centered on Martin.

""With 349 slot machines and 10 gaming tables, it's the fifth and by far the most modest casino in the Palm Springs area,"" the report said, adding almost ominously: ""But it stands to make a lot of non-Indian investors — and one Indian adult — rich.""

The Time series largely focused on problems plaguing tribal gambling, but critics said the piece reflected the anti-Native sentiment that underscored some of the opposition to tribes operating casinos.

""It was the most blatant kind of racism,"" Turner said.

(The Desert Sun, meanwhile, was more tempered and questioned the initial proposal by the tribe for a resort-style casino: ""We believe Indian gaming and related tourism, hotel and entertainment ventures will be good for the vitality of the Coachella Valley tribes in particular and the valley economy in general. But this Augustine venture does have us scratching our heads."")

But the reality for the Augustines was much more modest, at least at first. They initially considered a resort-style casino, but chose to build a smaller casino with a $16 million loan. By comparison, the Morongo tribe's casino in Cabazon was a $250 million project that opened to great fanfare in 2004.

Kupcha and Turner said Martin wanted to be conservative about the size of the casino, leery of how it would perform financially. Because it had fewer than 350 slot machines, the tribe was eligible for a quarterly payment through the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund, a pot of money paid into by tribal casinos that is distributed to tribes without casinos or those with fewer than 350 slot machines.

“Some other tribes have had pretty rough histories with their casino-fueled cultures.” Paul Turner, former deputy director of California's Housing and Urban Development Agency

The scrutiny may have contributed to Martin's avoidance of the media. Aside from the 1998 Press-Enterprise profile of Martin, she did not often give comment, authorizing Kupcha to issue statements on behalf of the tribe.

Leanna Thomas, the assistant to the chair of the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians, recalled that Martin was ""very, very private"" and uncomfortable with the sudden pressures of becoming a tribal leader.

Thomas said Martin expressed relief at being able to feel at ease around her. “It’s like instant famehood,” Thomas said. “You go from being a regular person to now everyone wanting to shake your hand. You just want to be able to go to the movies or walk down the street. You just want to be yourself again — not in a negative way, she just missed being a normal person sometimes.”

Dean Mike, a former chair of the Twenty-Nine Palms Band, first met Martin at the opening of the Augustine Casino. Mike said he was impressed with Martin's judgment of character, which likely led to the successful launch of the tribe’s business venture.

""With gaming, you have to get the right people to advise you and get people who know what they’re doing,"" Mike said. ""You have to have trusted people on your side to set all that up. To be a single person, with limited resources, she did quite well with the people she chose to help her get through that process.""

He added: ""It could have gone wrong.""

The tribe’s future

In nearly 20 years, the Augustine Casino has become one of Coachella’s largest employers, leaving a significant economic footprint in the eastern Coachella Valley. Known for its inexpensive food — Sunday’s all-you-can-drink champagne brunch costs $15 — the casino’s parking lot is almost always full.

Still, the casino and its workforce are dwarfed by the operations of larger tribes like the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, who employ more than 3,000 people across their various businesses, including the Morongo Casino Resort and Spa, Hadley Fruit Orchards and a 36-pump gas station. The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians has more than 2,200 employees and two casinos — the Agua Caliente Resort Casino Spa in Rancho Mirage and the Agua Caliente Casino in Palm Springs.

“The secret sauce is we offer a very good value to the people who live on this end of the valley.” Jef Bauer, Augustine Casino general manager

Because of tribal sovereignty, tribal casinos are not obligated to disclose casino revenue, but figures from the National Indian Gaming Commission show that in fiscal 2017, gross gaming revenue from tribal casinos totaled $32.4 billion from 494 gaming operations owned by 242 federally recognized tribes across the country.

The majority of casinos — 57% — make less than $25 million in revenue annually, according to National Indian Gaming Commission data.

General Manager Jef Bauer, a media-savvy casino executive who has worked in Nevada and Colorado, said the Augustine Casino may be small and lacking in amenities like a hotel or a golf course, but it has become a popular spot for locals.

“No one knew how successful it would be,” he said. “The secret sauce is we offer a very good value to the people who live on this end of the valley.”

He credits the tribe’s generosity to its employees as one of the reasons for the casino’s success. The casino offers a company-matched 401(k) retirement plan, as well as up to six weeks of paid time off for employees who have been employed for at least six years.

The Augustine Casino employs 380 people, a quarter of whom have worked for the casino for at least 10 years. Cocktail server Amelia Ambriz, pictured, has worked at the the Augustine Casino for 16 years.

The casino also raised the minimum wage for its non-tipped front-line employees to $13 per hour last year, two years ahead of California’s phased-in minimum-wage increases.

That translates to high employee retention; nearly a quarter of the workforce has been with the casino for at least 10 years. The average length of service is six years.

With casinos under pressure to attract younger patrons, the tribe has also recently expanded into skills-based games through its majority stake in Synergy Blue, a Palm Desert maker of arcade-style slot machines aimed at millennials. Some of those games are already featured at the Augustine Casino, but they hope to expand outside of California. The Nevada Gaming Commission in March approved Synergy Blue and the tribe for a manufacturing and distribution license.

With the casino thriving, Vance is now turning her attention to finishing the work her mother started — and expanding on it. Vance, who grew up on the reservation with her siblings living in a trailer, recalls how busy her mother was as she ran the tribal operations, negotiated the gaming compact with the state and launching the solar farm project.

The post of tribal chair was not a position she envisioned for herself a few years ago, when she was attending college and raising her two oldest children.

""I wanted to go into some type of psychology,"" she said. ""Not that I didn't love where I came from, but I wanted to do my own thing and then bring it into the tribe.""

Martin, who in 2015 appeared to be in remission from cancer, became sick again, forcing the tribe to figure out the succession plans to allow Martin to focus on her health. Vance first served as vice-chair before becoming tribal chair in 2016, when she was 29.

The final months were grueling. ""I was not only running the government, and making sure my mom was going to her appointments — I was pregnant with my third child and still going to school.""

Vance oversaw the 2016 renovation of the casino. Rather than subject patrons to months of construction, the casino closed for 25 days and reopened with a more contemporary design.

Planning for the next phase

Now, with the farm just months away from opening, Vance is planning construction on permanent office buildings for the casino’s operations and tribal government.

Eventually, plans include the construction of the reservation's own wastewater-treatment plant, which would make the tribe even more self-sufficient. The effort could potentially include help from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which offered assistance to the tribe during a recent council meeting.

The Augustines in 2008 opened the first phase of its 3-megawatt solar farm, which helps power its 30,000-square foot casino. Rows of palms are part of the 33-acre organic farm the tribe is preparing to open in the coming months.

The tribe's seven adult members are young, ranging from 26 to 32. Vance's siblings Ronnie and William are 29 and 27, respectively. Her cousins — Tiquan, 33, Victoria, 33, and Geramy Martin, 26 — are her uncle Gregory's children; Ashley Manning, 30, is her uncle Herbert's only child.

William, who serves as tribal vice chair and treasurer, is a recent graduate of UC Santa Barbara, where he majored in sociology. He is studying for a second bachelor's degree in philosophy, with a focus in law, through an online program offered by Arizona State University. Victoria, who lives in Indio, is studying for a communications degree from the University of Phoenix.

Vance, whose term expires in 2022, said she hopes others would eventually take the helm. The growing tribe will hold its first-ever election to choose their next chair.

""My goal has always been when I started is educating all the members on what goes on here, so that no matter who is running it, we have the same agenda,"" she said.

Just as Martin was motivated to secure a better future for her young children, Vance, too, is driven by the desire to sow the seeds for a sustainable future for her family, which will soon grow by a third.

Vance is expecting triplets later this summer and her cousin will soon welcome a new baby, which would bring the tribe's total enrollment to 16.

POWAY (AP) - Prosecutors say the 19-year-old man suspected of opening fire in a Southern California synagogue was arrested with a tactical vest, helmet and 50 unfired bullets.

In the first hearing for John T. Earnest, prosecutors in San Diego said Tuesday that he fired eight to 10 rounds before his rifle jammed in the shooting Saturday at Chabad of Poway synagogue.

One woman was killed and three were injured, including the rabbi.

Earnest pleaded not guilty at the hearing, where didn’t show any emotion. He wore glasses and stood behind a glass panel, appearing to glance at public defender John O’Connell for guidance.

The judge denied bail, calling Earnest an extreme threat to public safety.

923,Murders of 2 California women in 1970s linked to dead inmate,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) — DNA evidence has linked the cold-case rape and murder of two women in California’s Central Coast to a man who died of cancer in a Washington prison nearly four decades after the killings, authorities said Wednesday.

DNA taken from an old razor belonging to Arthur Rudy Martinez recently matched DNA left by the suspect in two unsolved killings in Atascadero in the late 1970s, San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson said at a news conference.

The body of 30-year-old Jane Morton Antunez was found in the back seat of her car on a dirt road on Nov. 18, 1977. She had been sexually assaulted, and her throat had been cut. Less than two months later, 28-year-old Patricia Dwyer was found sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her home on Jan. 11, 1978.

Martinez moved to Washington from Atascadero shortly after Dwyer was killed. He later was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of numerous rapes and robberies in Washington, but Martinez escaped from prison in 1994, Parkinson said.

Martinez returned to California and lived in Fresno under an alias for more than 20 years. He turned himself in on his Washington convictions after getting diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2014 so he could get medical treatment in prison, Parkinson said.

He died just about two months later at the age of 65 in the prison in Spokane.

At the time of the murders, Martinez was working as a welder in Atascadero and was on parole for convictions of attempted murder and rape. At one point, he had been considered as a potential suspect in the killings, but there was no evidence at the time linking him to either crime scene, Parkinson said.

The sheriff’s office reopened the 41-year-old cold case in 2017 and decided to test Martinez’s DNA after one of his family members was connected to the case through a familial DNA search, the sheriff’s office said.

“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims and are hopeful the resolution to these cases brings them some closure,” Parkinson said in a statement.

936,Andrew Janz set to announce his run for city of Fresno Mayor. The public is invited,"FRESNO, California - Fresno County violent crimes prosecutor Andrew Janz plans to announce his run for city of Fresno Mayor on Thursday.

He'll make the announcement at Radio Park around 5:30 p.m., and the public is invited to join.

“Fresno needs someone who is attuned to the needs of its people. Throughout my campaign for Congress and my time as a local prosecutor, I have met thousands of Fresnans who have expressed the need for change in city management. Together, we can work toward ending widespread poverty and the other drivers of homelessness and crime,” Janz remarked in a news release.

Janz is widely known for his congressional run against Rep. Devin Nunes in 2018.

In response, current Fresno Mayor, Lee Brand, released a statement:

I welcome the opportunity to have voters compare my well-earned experience and record of accomplishment, highlighted by creating over 5,000 good-paying jobs with benefits, to his complete lack of experience and a track record that consists of saying 'I'm not Devin Nunes.' Will his new campaign be 'I'm not Lee Brand'? To which I reply, ""Yes, young man, you’re right. You’re not Lee Brand. You aren't even close.""

942,"Indio police officer injures armed suspect in shooting, suspect identified as 44-year-old","An Indio police officer wounded a domestic violence suspect armed with a rifle who threatened to kill family members and police early Tuesday, a department spokesman said.

The shooting, which was the third involving officers this month, happened just after 5:30 a.m. at a home in the 81-200 block of Daffodil Court, which is in the southern portion of the city.

The suspect was being treated at Desert Regional Medical Center for a gunshot wound to a shoulder and he's expected to survive, police Chief Mike Washburn said.

The suspect was identified as Rigoberto Ramirez, 44, according to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. Washburn said he has a history of domestic violence and is known to police.

Ramirez was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer. He's being held in lieu of $30,000 bail at the Riverside County jail in Indio and he's scheduled to appear in court Thursday.

He was described as the husband and father of the family occupying a home on Daffodil. Someone from inside the home dialed 911 and said the suspect ""would kill family and officers when they arrived,"" Indio police spokesman Ben Guitron said.

He was armed with a rifle when officers arrived, Guitron said. Police tried to subdue him using non-lethal methods, which included 40-millimeter rubber balls. Efforts failed and an officer opened fire.

There were no injuries to officers or family members, among whom were the suspect's wife and at least one child. At least two guns were recovered, Guitron said.

Neighbors said several shots were fired, and one person claimed there was gunfire before police arrived.

The shooting was preceded by two others this month and Indio police said each one involved armed suspects.

""Those are unfortunately things where we can't always foresee what the outcomes are, especially when the suspect is armed,"" Guitron said. ""Whether they're going to hurt someone or not, we don't know.""

On April 10, an officer fatally shot a robbery suspect an apartment complex in the 81-800 block of Las Palmas Road. Police were investigating a robbery that occurred near Highway 111 and Monroe Street when they were notified the suspect was at the complex.

Then on April 19, officers were involved in a shooting at MiraBella Apartments in Bermuda Dunes.

They were investing an assault when they encountered a suspect at the complex. Police said the suspect, Cameron Kearney, opened fire on officers, who shot back.

No one was hit and Kearney was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer.

Each shooting involved a different officer, Guitron said.

951,Jaime Osuna: Bakersfield's cold-blooded killer,"Jaime Osuna: Bakersfield's cold-blooded killer Video Video Video

KERN COUNTY (KGET) -- ""I have no sympathy, I'm sadistic. I'll do it over and over again.""

Jaime Osuna is already serving life behind bars, for torturing and killing a Bakersfield woman back in 2011.

Now, at age 31, he’s suspected of killing his cellmate.

He calls himself sadistic and says he has no plans to stop killing.

The case of Jaime Osuna is one KRON4’s sister station KGET has been following for years.

As reporters, we cover a lot of crime. We’ve seen many horrific homicides. But Osuna is by far one of the most chilling stories we’ve seen.

His image is unforgettable -- his joker smile and satanic symbol tattooed across his face.

In 2017, KGET’s Olivia LaVoice sat down with Osuna at Lerdo Jail in Bakersfield.

He was in there for murdering Yvette Pena in cold blood.

Pena was a mother of six. A stranger to Osuna.

The day after he met her, she was found at the El Morocco hotel, with knives and a pair of scissors in her back.

""I did sadistically, premeditatedly, liberty tortured and murdered Yvette Peña,” Osuna confessed during the interview.

He told us on camera he killed Pena simply because he had the opportunity.

""The torture and all that, is more of trying to get a rush, it's an addiction, it's a drug,” Osuna said. “I would rather do that than do drugs, I would rather do that than have sex.""

And his motive? He said killing gives him a rish and a sense of fulfillment.

""I don't care if you're a lawyer, a teacher, a gang member. I don't care if you're my brother or sister. I don't care if you're who ever, it's about my decisions at that time,” Osuna said. “It's self-gratification to me.""

Even after he tortured Pena, he continued to torture her loved ones in court - making faces, laughing, and taunting her grieving family.

He even chatted calmly about the Oakland Raiders as he signed his life away.

""I've sat in this courtroom more than a dozen times, and all I've seen was a smile,” Pena’s sister said. “I can't control anybody's actions or emotions or control what's happened, but I do hope that one day, that Osuna will have sorrow, and remorse.”

As Pena’s sister said that, Osuna shook his head and nodded ‘nope.’

“It's not often, even as somebody who prosecutes murderers for a living that I come across somebody that's just plain evil,” said prosecutor Nick Lackie. “If anybody deserves the death penalty, Jaime Osuna does.”

But Osuna escaped the death penalty, taking a plea deal for life in prison without parole.

It doesn't just end with Pena's murder.

Osuna admitted, even bragged, to being responsible for two more unsolved murders.

Olivia: Did you know the other two victims?

Osuna: No.

Olivia: How old were you when you committed your first murder?

Osuna: 13.

Olivia: 13?

Osuna: 13.

Olivia: How old was the victim?

Osuna: The victim was 27, 27.

Olivia: And then in 2007 you killed a 32-year-old woman?

Osuna: yes. Olivia: Where did you kill that woman?

Osuna: You're getting into details now and I can't, sorry. That's one of the questions I can't ask. But the orchards I can say. Kern County has a lot of orchards.

Osuna told us he’s saving the details of those two murders.

As if his crimes are a horror movie and he’s building suspense.

Olivia: How? What are the circumstances behind that?

Osuna: I kind of don't want to get into that because I was young at that age, and that part had to do with, how can I say this, a certain, what is that word, I was kind of like a protege, had a teacher, really don't want to get into that one because I was kind of guided on that one, I was kind of helped, but that was the first taste of of...

Olivia: Was that gang-related?

Osuna: No, none of my crimes are gang-related.

Olivia: But you have someone in your life that taught you how to kill, is that what you're saying?

Osuna: I mean I seen it, there was a person, a friend, that to this day I still got friends that believe in the same stuff that I believe in...

Olivia: That share the same desires?

Osuna: Right exactly.

Osuna alluded to a childhood that may have shaped him to be the way he is.

East Bakersfield. No dad. A mom who was in and out.

So who raised him? The streets.

“Since I was a kid, 8-9 years old, I've killed animals,” Osuna admitted. “My mom would go to the store and I would put the cat in freezer. I would put it in the oven, you know stuff like that.""

Now, fast forward to 2019.

Osuna is serving a life sentence and he's admitted to killing his cellmate, Luis Romero at Corcoran State Prison.

According to documents KGET obtained, Romero was decapitated.

His lungs, eyeballs, and ear were removed and his body was completely mutilated.

Osuna admitted to all of it, but pled not guilty.

Now, he could face the death penalty.

""I love what I've experienced,” Osuna said. “To this day, if I can go back in time to change anything, would I? No. I would go back and do it again and over again. And if I’m released I will probably end up here again with the same case.""

There are still a lot of unanswered questions.

Mainly, why would a man who brags about killing be assigned a cellmate? How did he get a weapon like that? And why would he be left unsupervised?

957,Desert Hot Springs detective and his girlfriend accuse Chief Mondary of sending lewd messages,"CLOSE DHS Police Chief Dale Mondary was put on paid administrative leave April 29, 2019 while an investigation into potential misconduct is completed Wochit

Days after Desert Hot Springs Police Chief Dale Mondary was put on paid administrative leave amid an investigation into potential misconduct, a detective from his department, along with a woman who is now the detective's girlfriend, have come forward saying the chief sent the woman sexually explicit messages.

Desert Hot Springs Police Det. Larry Gaines, who is also the president of the Desert Hot Springs Police Department Police Officer's Association, said in an interview with The Desert Sun that his girlfriend went public with the messages on Facebook on Sunday. Mondary was put on leave on Monday. Gaines said the messages, sent on Facebook messenger in 2017, were received by his girlfriend while he was in her presence.

""When those messages were coming through, I was sitting right next to her,"" Gaines said. ""Yes: These are real messages. And yes: This happened.""

The Desert Sun has agreed to not use the name of the woman, who told the same story. She told The Desert Sun she posted screenshots of the messages on a Facebook account using a made-up name. They show a series of sexually graphic messages sent to her from what appears to be Dale Mondary's Facebook account in 2017.

Gaines reviewed the screenshots of the messages, and said they were the same messages sent to his girlfriend while Gaines was with her.

Gaines said Mondary apologized to him on at least two occasions at the Desert Hot Springs Police Department for sending the explicit messages.

Mondary has not responded to The Desert Sun's repeated requests for comment.

In early 2017, the woman said, she was in the process of divorcing her now ex-husband and had begun seeing Gaines. Her now ex-husband, a friend of Mondary's, had seen them together. The woman said her now ex-husband asked Mondary to look into it. She said Mondary then reached out over Facebook messenger to ask about her and Gaines.

The woman said she didn't consider her relationship with Gaines to be exclusive or official yet, so she messaged that she was single.

""Actually I'm a little mad at you about it,"" a message from what appears to be Mondary's Facebook account reads.

""Why??"" she responded.

""Had I known you were available... LOL,"" the sender responded.

""Im as single as it gets give me a break,"" the woman responded.

""Well if your [sic] single then we are doing lunch!!!"" the sender responded.

The woman said the conversation stopped then.

A short time later, the woman said, Gaines suggested they make their relationship exclusive.

Later in 2017, Gaines said, his girlfriend expressed interest in a career in law enforcement. She and Gaines coordinated a meeting with Mondary to discuss her interest in a program in which the Desert Hot Springs Police Department sponsors a person interested in completing the police academy.

Doria Wilms, the assistant to the city manager, said the City of Desert Hot Springs had a program like the one Gaines and his girlfriend described, but that they no longer run the program.

""If there is a non-sworn employee of the city that expresses interest and shows aptitude, the department has reclassified their position to recruit status and sponsored them for the academy,"" Wilms said. ""The last time that has happened was in 2018.""

The woman said she met with the chief at a Starbucks and spoke with him about what it was like to work in law enforcement and expressed interest in applying for the academy sponsorship.

Mondary, she said in an interview with The Desert Sun, encouraged her to apply for the sponsorship. But she said his behavior during the meeting made her uncomfortable.

""He was staring at my breasts the whole time,"" the woman said.

Gaines said he was upset because the chief knew by then that they were dating. But he said he didn't confront Mondary about it.

About a week later, Gaines said, the sexually explicit messages started.

In a screenshot of a text exchange, Mondary appears to tell the woman he is in Sacramento for a conference.

""I'm going to need you to keep me company by texting me,"" the message reads.

The woman said the messages arrived when she was with Gaines and another friend.

Gaines said his girlfriend asked him what she should do about the messages. Gaines said he told her to let the messages continue, to determine the sender's intentions.

""If he wants to be a dog,"" the woman said of the exchange, ""I'll let him be a dog.""

They were shocked, Gaines said, by how far the conversation went.

""I have to admit that from your pictures on Facebook I knew you were cute but when I saw you I thought..... DAMN,"" read one the message.

""I don’t want to freak you out and offend you,"" the sender continued.

The woman replied that she isn't easily freaked out.

""So the next time we meet you’re going to have a little bit more cleavage,"" the sender wrote.

""Ok done deal,"" she responded.

""I liked what I saw under your shirt but I would like to see more,"" the sender wrote.

The woman said she was surprised whenthe sender began describing in the messages how he wanted her to undress in front of him.

""You have me breathless,"" she responded.

Eventually, the sender said he wanted to have sex with her.

After that, Gaines said, he only interacted with the chief if his job required him to.

""I had nothing to say to him,"" Gaines said.

Gaines said he is still upset about the exchange.

After the exchange, the woman said she deleted the messages and even her Facebook account, but not before taking screenshots.

Gaines said he advised her against making the messages public initially because they both wanted to see if the messages continued.

The woman was ultimately not chosen for the recruitment sponsorship, but Gaines said he didn't think it was related to the messages. Gaines and his girlfriend said she did not go public with the screenshots in retaliation for not being selected for the academy program.

It wasn't until another officer was investigated for inappropriate messages sent on duty that the woman first considered posting the messages.

Desert Hot Springs Police Officer Travis Chapman was put on administrative leave in December 2018 following an investigation by The Desert Sun regarding sexually explicit and other inappropriate text messages the officer sent to an off-the-books informant

""How can you discipline and put another officer on admin leave when you’re doing the same thing,"" Gaines said. ""You gotta be held accountable for what you do, it doesn’t stop once you get stars or bars on your collar.""

Acting Chief Jim Henson said Tuesday the investigation into Chapman is ongoing.

Gaines said he has no ulterior motive for coming forward now, other than to show the public what he characterized as Mondary's hypocrisy.

""I have nothing to gain."" Gaines said. ""I have everything to lose.""

The woman emailed the messages to The Desert Sun on Sunday, saying in the email that she wanted to ""bring light to a very big issue.""

""I can not sit back and watch the disgusting actions of a man who is supposed to lead by example but yet punish other officers for the exact same behavior,"" she wrote in the email to The Desert Sun.

She said she also sent the messages to the personal Facebook accounts of Desert Hot Springs' City Manager Chuck Maynard and Deputy City Manager Luke Rainey on the same day.

Wilms said that to her knowledge, neither Maynard nor Rainey received the messages in their official email accounts.

""I can tell you with 100% certainty that they had no forward knowledge,"" Wilms said.

Gaines said he had some awareness that his girlfriend was going to publish the messages, but that the choice to publish them was hers.

Neither Gaines nor the woman have spoken with anyone in the police department or the city about the matter, they said.

960,Montague-area vehicle chase reached speeds of 100 mph,"Michael Lee Wilson II is facing “a myriad of charges,” said Yreka Area CHP Sergeant Scott Yox, including reckless driving, evading/resisting arrest, driving under the influence of narcotics, possession of drug paraphernalia, hit and run, and driving on a suspended license.

A 22 year-old Yreka man was apprehended after leading the California Highway Patrol on an 18 mile vehicle chase from Montague through Little Shasta and into Big Springs Wednesday night on sometimes narrow, windy roads at speeds up to 100 miles an hour.

Michael Lee Wilson II is facing “a myriad of charges,” said Yreka Area CHP Sergeant Scott Yox, including reckless driving, evading/resisting arrest, driving under the influence of narcotics, possession of drug paraphernalia, hit and run, and driving on a suspended license. Wilson was also wanted on a felony warrant out of Siskiyou County, Yox said.

The incident began just after 10 p.m. when a CHP officer observed Wilson, driving a green Subaru, make an unsafe turn in front of another vehicle at Scobie Street and 10th in Montague. This caused the other driver to slam on their brakes to avoid hitting the Subaru, Yox said.

When the officer attempted to stop Wilson, he did not comply and instead led the officer on a pursuit onto Webb Street, Ball Mountain Road and Harry Cash Road, Yox said.

“He was driving recklessly and crossing double yellow lines,” said Yox. “Fortunately, the traffic was light, but there were other drivers out there, and it was dangerous.”

As Wilson attempted to turn left onto A-12, he lost control of his vehicle and hit a fence, disabling the Subaru. Wilson fled the car on foot, eluding the officer, said Yox.

A CHP K-9 was brought in to search for the suspect, as well as a CHP helicopter. After searching for approximately 40 minutes, Wilson was located hiding inside a parked vehicle on private property off of Harry Cash Road, said Yox. He was taken into custody without further incident.

It is believed that Wilson was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the pursuit, Yox said. Fortunately, no one was hurt in the incident, he added.",https://www.siskiyoudaily.com/news/20190502/montague-area-vehicle-chase-reached-speeds-of-100-mph?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T08:02:44Z,"Siskiyou Daily News, Yreka, CA",Couple,"309 S Broadway St, Yreka, CA 96097, USA",CA,96097
963,"Salinas schools include LGBTQ history in curriculum, part of statewide push for inclusion","As part of a statewide shift to include more learning about underrepresented groups who have contributed to American history, the Salinas Union High School District has incorporated LGBTQ history into its curriculum. (Photo: PROVIDED/SUHSD)

As part of a statewide shift to include more learning about underrepresented groups who have contributed to American history, the Salinas Union High School District has incorporated LGBTQ history into its curriculum.

Beginning this school year, eighth and 11th-grade students are learning about LGBTQ people in their U.S. history classes.

“In teaching, the more students see themselves in the curriculum, the more engaged they are in their learning,” said Rob Darrow, an education consultant who helped integrate the new lessons for Salinas students. “And, in particular, it engages more LGBTQ students who didn’t even know they had a history.”

SUHSD is a model and one of the first districts in the state to include LBGTQ history, Darrow said.

What will the new classwork include?

The new classwork will add lessons, some of them multiday, to current courses about historical figures, like another perspective of what was happening, said Mark Gomez, a curriculum specialist for SUHSD. Or it can encompass a project on an event central to LGBTQ history, such as the 1969 Stonewall Riots, which sparked the community's modern push for civil rights.

“A more comprehensive and deep understanding of American history is to understand how identity and within that, sexual and gender identity, has always been a space that has led to either the expansion or reduction of rights and responsibilities,” Gomez said. “There’s a power structure and institutional ... legacies that are tied up within that.”

For eighth-graders in Salinas, Darrow said students can learn about certain Native American concepts of ""Two Spirit"" gender nonbinary people as well as interpretation of equality under the 14th Amendment through an LGBTQ historical lens.

High school students can expect to learn about LGBTQ history in the modern era, from the ""Lavender Scare"" parallel to the 1950s ""Red Scare,"" to the landmark 2015 Supreme Court decision granting same-sex marriage and ongoing struggles for people.

In addition to learning about new figures and events in LGBTQ history, he said, “it might be even more powerful to understand the nature of how identity politics has shaped our nation’s story by and large.”

A Thread:

LGBTQ voices have long been hidden, said Darrow. Instead, history has focused on the perspectives of straight white men.

It wasn’t until the last few decades that research uncovered analysis and stories. Universities now have established LGBT, queer and gender studies.

Implementation stemmed from California’s 2012 law, the Fair, Accurate, Inclusive and Respectful (FAIR) Education Act, which required studies, instruction and materials be more inclusive of marginalized groups, including LGBTQ communities.

How did it all come about?

History and social science frameworks were also updated by state education officials in 2016, followed by new textbooks integrating LGBTQ history.

Blanca Baltazar-Sabbah, SUHSD's associate superintendent of instructional services, said students in the 2016-17 school year requested history classes include contributions of LGBTQ people when asked for input on the local control and accountability plan, district budget priorities.

Stakeholders — including district staff, parents and students — wanted greater support for LGBTQ youth, too.

From feedback and state requirements, Baltazar-Sabbah said the district allocated funding to train teachers to integrate LGTBQ history into curricula.

This school year, SUHSD added the new framework. Gomez started working with teachers to implement these new lessons in class and eventually get new textbooks, which the SUHSD board of trustees must approve.

SUHSD has also held gatherings and workshops for students and teachers. In March, the district had its first-ever LGBTQ student summit which included schools' ""Be Yourself"" clubs for LGBTQ students.

Through LGBTQ history, Gomez said the district is helping to set the tone of what other districts are thinking.

This summer, the Monterey County Office of Education plans to host a two-day session with Darrow on LGBTQ history and inclusive environments.

To move forward, Darrow said different populations of people are needed to continue collaborations. Statewide changes also call for greater inclusion across all education.

“It’s not just about a history class,” he said. “It’s about making our schools more welcoming for all students so they do well in school.”

969,Burglar arrested at Spike Jonze's home in Los Feliz following SWAT situation,"- A burglary suspect allegedly armed with a knife holed up in the Los Feliz area home of film director Spike Jonze for more than four hours on Tuesday before surrendering, according to police and media reports.

Officers went to the 4000 block of Farmouth Drive about 6:15 a.m., according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

The resident told the officers that the unidentified intruder was armed with a knife, so a SWAT team was sent to the scene, police said.

According to TMZ, Jonze arrived home to find the man inside, and was able to get out of the house and call police.

SWAT officers surrounded the home, and the man surrendered about 10:30 a.m. No injuries were reported.

978,L.A. Free Press founder recalled as pioneering underground journalist and 'alchemist of life',"CLOSE Is it possible to balance nostalgia and reality in a national park gateway community over time? Kristin Scharkey/DESERT magazine

Memorial services are planned Saturday for Art Kunkin, a crown prince of the Southern California underground who found a receptive, reverential audience for his mind-expanding ideas in Joshua Tree.

Kunkin, 91 of New York, moved to Los Angeles in the 1950s and served as a leader in the movements that have defined the left coast, including advocacy journalism, civil rights, anti-Vietnam War protests, LGBTQ rights, humane drug laws, alternative music, metaphysical philosophy and life extension, including the study of alchemy.

He died Tuesday at his home at the Institute of Mentalphysics in Joshua Tree. Thai Buddhist Forest Monk Priest Pra Don counseled him during hospice care, said his Joshua Tree friend, Steven ""Sunny Sun-Downer"" Downer, to ""let go of everything when it comes to that transition time.""

Art Kunkin, a pioneering underground journalist-turned-spiritual seeker, died this week at 91. (Photo: Ming C. Lowe/Special to The Desert Sun)

Downer helped set up a Facebook tribute to Kunkin that continues to attract remembrances from throughout Southern California.

Roy Meurin of Burbank wrote that the last few times he saw him, Kunkin didn’t care to reflect on the ""great things he had done with his life.

""Art had learned The Universal Life Lesson, the lesson of everyone’s life story,"" he said. ""It’s all about Love.""

Robbi Robb of Joshua Tree wrote of the “awesome things"" he learned about Kunkin, ""like his secret nuclear apples and his relationships with people who were the greatest teachers.

""He was drinking buddies with these respected men and women,"" Robb said. ""Slowly I came to realize that that man with the little black book was himself a wizard.”

Ted Quinn of Joshua Tree called Kunkin, “an ascended master.

“One of the last times we visited, I mentioned that I had the Padmasambhava mantra that he'd taught me years ago stuck in my head, and (I) had been singing it after taking my son to see him,"" Quinn said. ""Art lit up and explained to me the meaning of the final three syllables, Om Ah Hum, as representing the physical, the mental and the emotional bodies. He never stopped learning and he never stopped teaching.”

Kunkin got his start in journalism as the business manager for the Socialist Workers Party newspaper, The Militant. He edited the journal of the Johnson-Forest Tendency, a humanist-Marxist organization led by Trinidad native C.L.R. James, in Los Angeles in the 1950s. But Kunkin was best known for founding and editing the Los Angeles Free Press, the first and largest underground newspaper of its kind, from 1964 through 1972.

Kunkin’s daughter, Anna Kunkin, said her parents started the weekly newspaper on the family dining room table. They had $15 to cover the cost of printing and mailing letters to advertisers, according to a Wall Street Journal article. By 1967, it had a circulation of 17,000. By 1968, it had topped 85,000 with 40 full-time editorial and clerical employees. Advertising revenues were $5,000 a week.

Counterculture icon Paul Krassner, whose syndicated column ran in underground newspapers across the country, said the Free Press paid more than other alternative papers and was “the best, most professionally underground weekly” in the nation.

“The real underground papers were like in San Quentin prison, where no one knew who was doing the printing,"" said Krassner. ""The L.A. Free Press was out in the front. People would go up to the cars and say, ‘Want a copy of the L.A. Free Press?’ And those people would get paid.”

Anna said her father was actually “kicked out” of the Socialist Party because the L.A. Free Press wasn’t free. It charged 15 to 25 cents per copy at a time when the Los Angeles Times was 10 cents a day. But several former L.A. ""hippies"" posted on Kunkel's Facebook page that the money they made hawking copies of the Free Press helped them survive on the streets in the '60s.

Kunkin anticipated digital journalism when he instituted a policy that “Every reader is a reporter.” He developed an interactive relationship with the L.A. counterculture and led it like a general leading an army against common causes.

“He wasn’t creating a left-wing paper, he was reflecting what was going on,” said Steven Finger, a friend for 48 years who helped sustain and revive the L.A. Free Press in the 2000s. “It was meant to cover what the L.A. Times would not cover.”

“It was meant to cover what the L.A. Times would not cover.” Steven Finger, who helped revive the L.A. Free Press in the 2000s

Kunkin has been credited for helping to build opposition to the Vietnam War by publicizing the times and places of anti-war protests.

""They weren’t in the main dailies,” said Krassner. “So, they filled that information for people who wanted to participate in those protests.”

“Those protests would have been a fraction of the amount of people there if it wasn’t for the L.A. Free Press,” added Finger. “It touched them like Instagram and Twitter. In those days, it was the L.A. Free Press.”

Kunkin was a longtime member of the Congress for Racial Equality and his paper’s coverage of the 1965 Watts Riots was called “better than any other local paper's, including that of the Los Angeles Times,"" by Dave McBride in his 2003 book, “Death City Radicals: The Counterculture of Los Angeles.”

Kunkel also promoted Frank Zappa’s pre-psychedelic band, The Mothers of Invention, by turning the Free Press into ""the official News of the Mothers” in 1966 — when the made-for-television band, The Monkees, were the hottest thing in L.A. Kunkel was nicknamed “Father of the Mothers,” Downer said, because, “He helped them to stop fighting and get gigs around Los Angeles.”

Anna said her father often inserted himself into the causes he supported.

“My dad had a special ability to talk to large groups of people, a certain charm,” she said. “There was a love-in at Elysian Park and there was a group of kids there. It was like a free concert and the cops came and there was a fear that they were going to attack them. My father got up and started talking to (the kids). He said, ‘Sit down. Everybody calm down.’ And they did. He had that ability.”

But, Kunkin's advocacy didn’t always come without a cost.

“His office was bombed three times,” said Finger. “The gay movement was split between moderate gays and radical gays, and a radical gay wrote in and said, ‘You keep supporting the moderate gay party and I’m going to firebomb your office. That was in the paper as a letter to the editor! And, sure enough, they did!”

The Los Angeles Police Department didn’t recognize the Free Press’s advocacy journalism as “real” journalism and wouldn’t give its reporters press passes to access police files and crime scenes.

“He felt totally that he deserved the press passes,” Finger said. “When he went to the commission to get them approved, they said he was not covering police stories and police blotter stories. He pointed out that he was covering police stories, just not in the way the establishment papers did. And he went to court.”

When the Supreme Court eventually refused to hear his appeal, Kunkin took matters into his own hands.

“Art took the opportunity to print a press pass in the paper,” Finger said, “so everybody could print it out and be an L.A. Free Press reporter.”

Change of fortune

The Free Press had such success mobilizing the counterculture, Kunkin admittedly went over a journalistic line. Ultimately, it led to financial ruin.

During the days when undercover narcotics agents were routinely accused of planting drugs on ""hippies,"" a source gave Kunkin the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 80 state narcotics agents. And Kunkin printed them in the Free Press. A senior narcotics agent filed a $15 million suit against the paper, the Wall Street Journal reported, and state Attorney General Thomas C. Lynch brought a $10 million suit against it for ""wrongful disclosure of confidential information which jeopardized the lives, health and safety of law enforcement officers and their families.""

Kunkin settled out of court for $50,000 and made a page one admission that he erred in running the agents' names in his fight against secret police tactics.

Finger said his regret was real.

“When I talked to Art over these last couple days, I asked him if there were any things he could have and should have done different,” Finger said. “He distinctly said he would not have revealed the addresses of the narcotics agents. He (said) he didn’t realize the ramifications of printing their addresses.”

The federal government also sued Kunkin for $25 million. He purchased a printing press from England to handle his growing circulation, and, when it failed, he juggled his books to pay his bills.

“They finally got him for payroll tax evasion,” Anna said. “For all the legal fees, he was taking money out of the payroll tax accrual. After that, he was into the cash world, the underground world. Because he had this hanging over his head, he could not open a business.”

The Free Press was funded largely by adult entertainment ads, which mainstream newspapers wouldn't run. Kunkin sold the L.A. Free Press to pornographers who wanted continued media access, Finger said, before his business went into bankruptcy. Organized crime was heavily invested in pornography at the time, and Anna said the buyers were mobsters.

“Initially, he lost the paper because he had the opportunity to borrow money from the mob, and he broke down and borrowed money,” she said. “But he didn’t borrow enough money and they eventually took over the paper. I’ve heard him say he just didn’t borrow enough.”

Kunkin revived the paper four times before the version he created with Finger went out of print in 2007. After the first group of investors took it over in 1972, Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt purchased it for Kunkin to run.

“Art worked for Larry Flynt as an editor,” Finger said, “but, because he didn’t have complete control, half the staff left to form a paper called The Staff. (Another) portion formed a paper called Tuesday’s Child. That is what impacted Art. It wasn’t because he couldn’t get more money from Flynt. The paper was still up in numbers. But it wasn’t really his paper. He left and the paper continued as a shadow of itself.”

New direction

But, around that time, Kunkin was moving in a spiritual direction. He started studying Sufism and then delved deeper into esotericism.

“He had an experience,” Anna said. “It was right around the end of the paper. He had the experience of healing somebody from a distance in a seminar and that changed his whole world. It was a workshop where you learned how to heal from afar.”

Kunkin became a journalism instructor at CSU Northridge, and his former student, Sylvan Tauber, praised his lectures on Facebook for his ""world-wide perspective on news reporting and the business of information dissemination.”

But his deep dive into esotericism led him to Manly P. Hall’s Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles, which still contains more than 50,000 volumes of metaphysical and spiritual books going back to ancient times, not including Hall’s books on alchemy that were sold to the Getty Research Institute in 1995.

Kunkin became president of the Philosophical Research Society after Hall died in 1990. But he also studied with Tibetan meditation teacher Andrew Da Passano and became administrator of his Temple of Esoteric Science in Los Angeles.

“What he found was that Andrew’s meditation teaching was parallel to the alchemy,” said Anna. “Alchemy worked with the three bodies — the physical, mental and the spiritual. So, in alchemy, you separate those bodies and distill them and then you bind them again, and that’s how you create these medicinal essences. That was the first Western medicine. The alchemists were historically herded up and burned at the stake until the one percent needed healing, and then they’d go to an alchemist.

""So, Andrew’s meditation involved going inward and visualizing the separation of the mental, the physical and the spiritual bodies in yourself — working on them and then combining them. That was the meditation he taught.”

Kunkin traveled to Salt Lake City to study alchemy for seven years as an apprentice at the Paracelsus Research Society, founded by Frater Albertus, who developed transmutation theories based on principles related to the enrichment of uranium before his 1984 death. Kunkin edited their journal, Essentia, and worked to produce substances to extend human life.

“Art is a true mystic, an alchemist of life and a grand wizard in his own right. In terms of spiritual attainments, the air is rare where Art sits.” Andre Vaillancourt, friend of Art Kunkin

Kunkin's friend, Andre Vaillancourt of Los Angeles, said on Facebook he met Kunkin at Da Passano's Temple of Esoteric Science before Kunkin moved to Utah. They re-connected upon his return to L.A. and continued their long, deep discussions after Kunkin moved to Joshua Tree.

“Art is a true mystic,"" Vaillancourt wrote, ""an alchemist of life and a grand wizard in his own right. In terms of spiritual attainments, the air is rare where Art sits.”

Kunkin moved to Joshua Tree in 1999. He lectured at the Institute of Mentalphysics and lived on its property. Visitors said his home was covered from floor to ceiling with books, many about alchemy. Artist Ming C. Lowe of Palm Desert had a chance to photograph Kunkin and observe his ""secret nuclear apples.

“He had a jar with a uranium rock in it,"" she said. ""He put an apple in the jar — at first it was a pear — and ate a piece every day (or two). He said in the Bible people lived hundreds of years and he thought it was because the original orchard, where they ate their food, was on a uranium field. He planned on being around for 200 years.”

Anna noted, “While he didn’t reach his goal of 200 years, 91 is a respectful accomplishment.”

Steve Brown, editor-publisher of Sun Runner Media in Joshua Tree, called Kunkin “the real deal.

“I deeply respect Art's history with journalism,"" Brown said, ""but I love that he was not constrained from following wherever his heart, mind and soul led him. I love the philosopher and the alchemist as much, if not more, than the journalist. He's been an inspiration personally and professionally, and will always be one of my true heroes and champions in life.”

Kunkin is survived by his daughters, Anna and April Fountain, and their mother, Abby Rubinstein. A memorial service is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Beatnik Lounge in Joshua Tree. Another memorial in L.A. is pending.

Finger said the L.A. Free Press will return May 24 at TheLAFP.com with content showing the parallels between 50-year-old Free Press articles and the news of today.

987,"Strange lights in the sky over Fresno, what are they?","Strange lights in the sky over Fresno, what are they? Video

FRESNO, California - Have you noticed something strange in the sky, flying over the valley, in the last couple of weeks?

A man living in northwest Fresno has and he grabbed his smart phone and got video of it.

Robert Tiger says he's seen several drones over the past few weeks.

Tiger says not one, two or even three but a squadron of drones hovering around Fresno, and that's not all.

Tiger says, ""They are in the sky from sundown to sunrise and what's different about it too is they have an escort.""

Tiger says the drones have a plane which circles all these drones for hours at a time.

CBS47 spoke with the Federal Aviation Administration and even shared with the video with the feds.

Investigators say it could very well be drones.

However, they add because Tiger's house is in the direct path of the Fresno Airport it could be a plane or even a far away planet.

The FAA wants to remind the public that very strict restrictions are in place, when it comes to flying drones in the state of California.

Restrictions which members of the Fresno County Sheriff's Department Air Support Unit wished the public obeyed.

Sgt. Rich Coningsby says, ""Everybody that has a drone should read up on the rules on how to operate a drone, how to register a drone.""

In 2014, a drone nearly took down one of the department's helicopters just north east of Clovis.

Sgt. Coningsby says, ""it came well within 100 feet of us and we were well over 500 feet. We did contact the drone operator. It wasn't malicious, he just wasn't sure on the altitude he was flying.""

The FAA says while there are no regulations prohibiting flights over homes or private property, local privacy laws can apply.

The agency adds your drone must be registered with the FAA.

You have to fly below 400 feet, and never near a manned aircraft or airport.

For more restrictions check out the FAA website.



As for Tiger, he plans to keep his eyes fixed on the Fresno sky.

988,Salton Sea wetland projects access agreement afoot,"CLOSE This drone video shows where the Whitewater River pours into the Salton Sea. After a heavy rain readers wondered where all the water went. Palm Springs Desert Sun

With the clock ticking, a major hurdle to restoring the southern edge of the fast-drying Salton Sea may finally be overcome. Imperial Irrigation District general manager Henry Martinez told the Desert Sun that he and California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot have reached an agreement in principle that the state — not the water district — will be responsible for construction and maintenance of more than 3,700 acres of wetlands aimed at controlling toxic dust and restoring wildlife habitat.

In exchange, the water district will sign easements for access onto lands it owns that border California's largest lake. The agreement could break a years-long impasse and find ways to get restoration projects moving.

""If I was a betting man, I'd put down 100 bucks that we'll get it done,"" Martinez said. ""Both of us are highly confident we're going to meet the deadlines we’ve set for ourselves.""

A spokesperson for the state natural resources agency confirmed that they were close to finalizing a deal.

""We continue to have productive discussions and look forward to having easements for the IID board to take up very soon,"" said Lisa Lien-Mauger, the agency's deputy secretary for communications.

The water district's board of directors is tentatively scheduled to vote on the proposed easement documents on May 7. Martinez said he's had fruitful discussions with them, and thinks the documents will be approved.

""The board has been very supportive,"" he said, noting that kick-starting the state projects could also provide traction for matching federal funds from this year's Farm Bill package. ""We want to have projects ready to go, and key to those projects is having these easements ready to go.""

More: Salton Sea 10-year 'rescue' plan flawed, but letting lake revert to desert would be folly

Imperial Irrigation District's board and staff are hungry for a victory after being shut out of a seven-state Colorado River drought plan, after they insisted unsuccessfully that federal funds to restore the Salton Sea be tied to the plan.

Martinez said he's been sitting down in face-to-face meetings with Secretary Crowfoot on a weekly basis, and talking often in between. And Lien-Mauger, the spokesperson for the California Natural Resources agency said Gov. Newsom has been kept informed of the progress.

The Salton Sea has been drying and growing saltier for years, but the process has accelerated in the past 17 months, since Colorado River waters were diverted to urban San Diego and Riverside communities from farms that run off into the lake.

Although state, federal and regional officials knew for 15 years that the water would be diverted, and spent hundreds of millions of dollars studying potential solutions, not a single project has been successfully completed and now the lake, its wildlife and water and air quality are declining rapidly, as was long predicted.

While there is still no long-term plan to address the challenges, under the terms of a 10-year pilot management plan finalized in 2017, the Natural Resources Agency is mandated to build an increasing number of acres of wetlands and dust suppression projects each year. In March, they admitted they'd failed to meet the modest goal of restoring just 500 acres the very first year. And Bruce Wilcox, the agency's assistant secretary of Salton Sea policy, said Tuesday it could take until year three to begin construction of the wetlands.

But resources secretary Crowfoot and California Water Resources Control Board chair E. Joaquin Esquivel, who like Martinez are new on the job, have personal stakes in seeing a turnaround at the sea. Crowfoot's first official trip after being appointed by Newsom was to the Salton Sea area. And he also tried to bring the different sides together at the Salton Sea in his previous role as head of the Water Foundation. Esquivel grew up in La Quinta and fished at the sea as a boy.

More money is rapidly being spent in Sacramento. New engineers and planners are being hired, and a supposedly streamlined design-build process will be used to construct the wetlands — although it could initially cause additional delays.

Access to 30 parcels owned by IID could mean ground is finally broken on a key piece — a 3,100-acre species habitat plan to construct a series of marshes and ponds between the southern edge of the lake and active farm fields. The aim is twofold: to suppress dangerous dust storms and to bring back suitable habitat for fish and migratory birds.

A key sticking point for IID officials has been the possibility that the district could be saddled with costly lawsuits should something go wrong with any of the wetland projects. Those issues could range from wetland water backing up onto nearby crops, killing them with the same types of salts and toxics that have been drained off the fields, to discharges from fields harming federally protected endangered species, such as the desert pupfish.

""From a water manager perspective, I have an obligation to ensure these projects don’t interfere with IID’s day-to-day operations and maintenance responsibilities that keep agriculture productive and viable in our service area,"" said Tina Shields, head of the district's water management department, in remarks at the March public update session.

The wetlands could require active management for between 30 and 50 years. State taxpayers rather than water district ratepayers could now be on the hook if any liability issues crop up.

Shields also made clear at the March meeting that the agency does not think the blame falls solely on the water district for the lack of progress over more than 15 years.

""IID has put forth significant effort, including thousands of hours of staff time and resources,"" she said. ""I think it’s a bit one-sided to imply access to IID-owned lands is the primary roadblock, when there are many state deficiencies, including a lack of sufficient staffing, planning, permitting, and coordination of resources, with Salton Sea program staff scrambling after being missing in action during the 15-year mitigation water planning period.""

But she said, ""We appreciate the new attitude and interest in the Sea from Governor Newsom and his staff, and IID shares his resolve to move forward. Unlike those based in Sacramento, we all live here and have a vested, personal interest in real progress.""

990,Law firm to investigate 'conduct' of Desert Hot Springs police chief placed on leave,"CLOSE DHS Police Chief Dale Mondary was put on paid administrative leave April 29, 2019 while an investigation into potential misconduct is completed Wochit, Wochit

Desert Hot Springs' top officials have put the small town's police chief, Dale Mondary, under formal investigation and on indefinite leave while a private law firm examines complaints regarding social media brought to the city's attention on Monday.

A city spokeswoman said the firm, Stream Kim Hicks Wrage and Alfaro, will investigate Mondary's ""conduct.""

Mondary did not respond to numerous requests for comment. Reached at his residence, Mondary said through his doorbell intercom system only: ""Get off my property.""

At a news conference on Tuesday, spokeswoman Doria Wilms, assistant to the city manager, distributed copies of the city's social media messaging policies.

""Yesterday morning, the city manager was contacted with allegations against Chief Mondary,"" she said. She declined to confirm the ""root of the investigation.""

“The authenticity of the allegations are part of the investigation, and his conduct thereafter,” she said. ""If Chief Mondary wishes to take your call and defend himself he is free to.""

She said, however, that Mondary, is not allowed to speak with anyone at City Hall other than City Manager Chuck Maynard while on his imposed leave. She said he's not allowed to be in contact with his interim replacement, Acting Chief Jim Henson.

While declining to comment beyond a brief statement and failing to answer most questions from reporters, Wilms said, ""I want the community to feel confident in our commitment to letting the facts speak for themselves. We're are going to be as transparent as possible.""

Mondary has found support online on various social media sites. Still, the investigation caught city residents and boosters off guard.

""While we may not know the details of the investigation, we believe Chief Mondary to be a great man and an exemplary police chief,"" said Kephyan Sheppard, a pastor at Word of Life Fellowship Center In Desert Hot Springs.

​He said a prayer vigil will be held Friday at 6 p.m. at the city's police station. The goal is to pray for the healing of the community and to show they stand with Mondary and the police department.

Councilman Russell Betts said City Manager Chuck Maynard sent a memo at about 2:45 p.m. on Monday notifying the council that there was a personnel matter regarding Mondary.

Prior to Tuesday's news conference, city officials had not said what spurred the investigation, only that the chief is on paid administrative leave and that an external agency would conduct the inquiry.

Mondary's personnel inquiry comes months after he put Desert Hot Springs Police Officer Travis Chapman on paid leave for graphic text messages he was sending while on duty.

The department conducted an administrative inquiry into Chapman's case in September, but after The Desert Sun met with Mondary in December to review information about the incident, the department reopened the case.

“I wasn’t happy one bit with what I found in the text messages,” Mondary said in a December 2018 interview. “Our administrative inquiry found violations of department policy, and we took what we found to be appropriate action.”

During an interview with The Desert Sun regarding Chapman, Mondary said he took the opportunity to inform his officers of department policy and how to conduct themselves professionally when on duty.

“We blew up with the disclosure of these texts,” Mondary said. “A number of officers have been informed about how to manage developing sources in the future.”

Chapman's internal affairs inquiry is ongoing.

994,Man contracts flesh-eating bacteria in water,"- The second case of flesh-eating bacteria has been reported out of the Bay Area, this time in a man who visited from Ohio last month. Doctors were able to save the man's foot following his spring break trip to Pinellas County.

Barry Briggs likely contracted the bacteria when he and his son were in the water off of Weedon Island on March 23. That night, Briggs' foot began to swell.

Less than 48 hours later, after traveling home, Briggs was in the hospital undergoing emergency surgery. He'll never forget what the surgeon told him before he went under the knife.

""'I really hope I don't have to take your foot.' So that was when it all slammed into place, brought it home to me,"" Briggs said. ""Even though my wife had started telling me some of the things that can go wrong that's when it really seared it into my brain.""

Doctors saved his foot and potentially his life.

""Everything I think went right. I feel very fortunate that we had all those pieces in place,"" he said.

This is the second flesh-eating bacteria case in the Bay Area in less than a month. Not long after Briggs contracted his infection, Mike Walton ended up with one in his hand after cutting himself with a fishing hook.

Both cases happened off the coast of Pinellas County.

“They said in a few hours this would have gone up my arm into my chest and I wouldn’t have been here,"" Walton told FOX 13.

Dr. Jeremy Kirtz, an E.R. physician with AdventHealth in Tampa, said these cases are rare but even the smallest open wound can become a serious problem if it becomes infected.

""Any break in the skin can cause it, even something like athlete's foot, chronic wounds in the skin because the skin is what protects you from the outside world,"" Kirtz said. ""It can be deadly, absolutely. You need to show in the hospital. You're going to need surgery to save that limb and, if it spreads, to save your life.""

Kirtz said people who are diabetic have a higher risk of coming down with a flesh-eating bacterial infection. He also said these cases are rare. He's treated roughly four in his 13 years as an E.R. physician.

These cases are important reminders to make sure cuts are healed before getting into the water, especially during the warmer months. Kirtz said it's important to get to the hospital quickly if an open wound appears infected and its condition worsens.",http://www.foxla.com/health/ohio-man-contracts-flesh-eating-bacteria-in-water-off-pinellas-county,2019-04-30T16:03:07Z,FOX LA,Couple,"1999 S Bundy Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90025, USA",CA,90025
996,Man traps himself in hole dug to spy on his former girlfriend,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

MEXICO CITY - (AP) — A man in northern Mexico had to be rescued after he accidentally trapped himself in a hole that he dug so he could spy on his former girlfriend in violation of a court order to stay away from her, authorities said Sunday.

The Sonora state attorney general's office said the 50-year-old man had spent days digging the hole in Puerto Penasco, a town on the Gulf of California, only to become trapped and require assistance to get out.

The man had been ordered to stay away from his former girlfriend due to domestic violence charges and he is now in jail, authorities said.

The newspaper El Universal said the man dug a tunnel under the woman's house. It said the woman told police that over the course of a week, she had heard scratching noises but assumed the noise was cats. But when the sound grew louder, she investigated and found her former partner of 14 years trapped below, the report said. She said she ended the relationship because her partner was very jealous.

Police said the man appeared intoxicated and severely dehydrated once they got him out of the tunnel.

1002,La Quinta baseball can't find its 2018 magic in playoff opening loss to Temescal Canyon,"During last year's magical CIF-SS title run for the La Quinta Blackhawks, everything went right -- their line drives found gaps, their defense saved runs, close calls went their way, and the key hit, the key pitch always happened when it was needed.

But baseball is a fickle sport, and the 2019 postseason run for the Blackhawks ended before it started. All those little, game-changing baseball moments went against them Friday as they lost their playoff opener to a talented team from Temescal Canyon 5-2.

The Blackhawks won the CIF-SS Division 4 title last year, and because of their success were bumped up to Division 2 this year. That increase in the level of opponent made a difference as Temescal Canyon was as good as any team the Blackhawks saw during their playoff run last year.

The visiting Titans came out swinging. Three batters into the game, they already had a 1-0 lead and let the Blackhawks know this was going to be a tough one. Temescal Canyon scored single runs in the first, third, fourth and fifth innings to take a 4-0 lead, and talented lefty Dane Padrnos was keeping the Blackhawks off balance.

But as they did so many times these last two years, La Quinta finally started to find some cracks in the armor in the bottom of the sixth inning. A hit batsman, two singles and a double produced two runs to cut it to 4-2.

The Titans added an insurance run in the top of the seventh to make it 5-2. But in the bottom of the seventh after a pair of walks and a pair of outs, the never-say-die Blackhawks had one last chance. Steven Lafayette ripped a line drive to center field, but it was an ""at-'em"" ball as they say as the Temescal Canyon centerfielder was able to scoot over and make the catch and end the game.

""That's the way baseball goes,"" second-year coach Brian Wisler said. ""Last year we kind of had those breaks that went our way and this year, this game, it didn't. Tip your cap to them, though, that's a good team, pitcher threw great and they made some really good defensive plays. At this level, you have to play a clean game. We didn't and they did.""

The bottom of the sixth inning was the moment when it looked like the Blackhawks might've found their 2018 mojo.

Down 4-0, Miles Dille was hit by a pitch to start the inning. Then, after a popout, Jason Leon ripped a single and that was followed by another hard-hit single from Sakemi Sato. Sato's single brought home Dille to get the Blackhawks on the board.

After a fly out, sophomore Abraham Hernandez came to the plate with men on first and third and two outs. Hernandez has had a knack for the big hit all year, and he came through again. He laced a double to the right-field gap. Leon scored from third, and Sato was given the green light to try to score from first.

It was a logical decision with two outs, but the relay and throw home were accurate and it was a bang-bang play with a head-first slide at home. Sato was called out at the plate. A huge moment in the game. Instead of being down 4-3 with a runner on second, the inning was over and the Blackhawks trailed 4-2.

The stars

DJ Jones, Temescal Canyon: Jones was the player of the game. He had a double and two singles, scored twice and knocked in a run. The only time the Blackhawks retired Jones was on a great diving stab by Lafayette at shortstop. Jones also made a fantastic defensive play at second base in the bottom of the seventh to thwart the Blackhawks.

Jack McClellan, Temescal Canyon: McClellan wears No. 72 and he helped prove right my theory that if someone has an odd number in baseball or softball, they are probably a pretty good player. McClellan had an RBI single in the first inning and an RBI double in the fifth.

Miles Dille, La Quinta: The Blackhawks' leadoff man was on base three out of four times with a single, a walk and a hit-by-pitch. He scored one run.

Andres Arellano, La Quinta: The Blackhawks' starter went 5 1/3 innings, allowed five hits and was the victim of some errant fielding behind him. He struck out four along the way.

Buy Photo Andres Arellano of La Quinta pitches against Temescal Canyon, May 3, 2019. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun)

Dane Padrnos, Temescal Canyon: The Titans' starting pitcher threw six strong innings, allowing two runs and striking out six Blackhawks and only walking one.

Devlin Lindeman, Temescal Canyon: The Titans' catcher walked and scored a run at the plate, but had a great game behind the dish. He picked off a runner at first to squelch a first-inning Blackhawks rally. He applied the tag on that key play at the plate. And to top it all off, he pitched the seventh inning to get the save.

The chatter

Coach Wisler on Temescal Canyon: ""They came out early, scored a run, they were aggressive. We did not play good defense on a couple of routine plays, and that's what we patent our team off of (with) pitching and defense, and we just didn't do what we usually do there.""

More Wisler: ""Everybody's dejected. They're down because we truly thought we were going to win the ball game. I think every championship caliber team has that mindset. You're going to find a way to win. A little disappointed in the way we played. We kind of threw the ball around, kind of like the last game of the year against PD and it kind of carried over.""

Wisler on the season: ""Hey, it was another great year for us. We won 19 games in a row, co-league champs, a lot to be proud of. This was a close game that could've swung either way, and we came out on the short end. But great season. Proud of this team.""

The takeaway

As I walked down the hill toward the diamond I was struck by how many fans had made the trip to support Temescal Canyon. That's usually a good indicator that you are about to see a pretty good ball club. People don't make long drives during the workday during the week to see a team they don't expect to win. And that rang true. Temescal Canyon exuded confidence in their body language. Coach Wisler used a good word ""clean."" Temescal Canyon played clean baseball. They were the better team.

For the key seniors on the Blackhawks' team -- Arellano, Dille, Lafayette, Josiah Torres, Trenton Schwanke to name a few -- this is a hard way to go out, but no one will ever be able to take away that CIF-SS title they won last year, the first in school history. And this was a special year, too, it's just that the difference between Division 4 and Division 2 means you can't get away with little mistakes, and that's what happened Friday. Kudos to all the seniors on the team for a spectacular two-year run.

1008,Prosecutors: Poway synagogue attacker had 50 unfired bullets,"Prosecutors: Poway synagogue attacker had 50 unfired bullets Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. Video

POWAY, Calif. (AP) — The man accused of attacking a Southern California synagogue fired only eight to 10 of the roughly 60 bullets he had before his weapon jammed, prosecutors said Tuesday.

John T. Earnest, 19, pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder in the shooting that happened Saturday during a Passover service at the Chabad of Poway synagogue. One woman was killed and three people wounded, including the rabbi.

Earnest was arrested shortly after the attack with 50 unfired bullets, a tactical vest and helmet, prosecutors said during his arraignment.

At the hearing, a bespectacled Earnest stood behind a glass panel, wearing blue jail clothes and showing no apparent emotion. He uttered only one word — “yes” — to waive his right to a speedy preliminary hearing.

The judge scheduled a status hearing for May 30 and denied bail, calling Earnest an extreme threat to public safety.

Earnest was an accomplished student, athlete and musician whose embrace of white supremacy and anti-Semitism has dumbfounded his family and others who thought they knew him well.

He made the dean’s list both semesters last year as a nursing student at California State University, San Marcos. In high school, he had stellar grades, swam on the varsity team and basked in the applause of classmates for his piano solos at talent shows.

Earnest apparently became radicalized sometime over the last two years. He is also charged with arson in connection with an attack last month on a mosque in nearby Escondido.

Owen Cruise, 20, saw Earnest every day during senior year at Mt. Carmel High School in San Diego when the two were in calculus and physics together. They were also both in the school’s amateur radio club.

Earnest’s piano performances drew audiences to their feet.

His father, John A. Earnest, is a popular physics teacher at Mt. Carmel, where he has worked for 31 years.

“The way John T. acted is not representative at all of the way he was raised,” Cruise said. “They are an outstanding family. Some of the finest people I’ve ever met.”

The suspect’s parents said their son and five siblings were raised in a family that “rejected hate and taught that love must be the motive for everything we do.”

“To our great shame, he is now part of the history of evil that has been perpetrated on Jewish people for centuries,” the parents said Monday in their first public comments. “Our son’s actions were informed by people we do not know, and ideas we do not hold.”

The parents, who are cooperating with investigators, refused to provide legal representation to their son, and he was represented by a public defender.

Earnest burst into the synagogue on the last day of Passover, a major Jewish holiday that celebrates freedom, and opened fire with an assault-style rifle on the crowd of about 100.

He fled when the rifle jammed, according to authorities and witnesses, avoiding an Army combat veteran and an off-duty Border Patrol agent who pursued him. He called 911 to report the shooting and surrendered a short time later.

Lori Kaye , a founding member of the congregation, was killed. Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein was shot in the hands, while Noya Dahan, 8, and her uncle Almog Peretz suffered shrapnel wounds.

Kaye, 60, was remembered for her kindness Monday at a memorial service at the packed synagogue in Poway, a well-to-do suburb north of San Diego.

An online writing by a person identifying himself as John Earnest and published shortly before the attack spewed hatred toward Jews and praised the perpetrators of attacks on mosques in New Zealand that killed 50 people last month and at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue that killed 11 on Oct. 27.

Earnest frequented 8chan, a dark corner of the web where those disaffected by mainstream social media sites often post extremist, racist and violent views.

“I’ve only been lurking here for a year and half, yet what I’ve learned here is priceless. It’s been an honor,” he wrote.

Earnest, who evidently intended to livestream the attack, said he had planned the attack for four weeks.

“If you told me even 6 months ago that I would do this I would have been surprised,” Earnest wrote.

The FBI said it got tips about a social media post threatening violence against Jews about five minutes before the 11:30 a.m. attack.

The tips to an FBI website and hotline included a link to the anonymous post but did not offer specific information about its author or the location of the threat. The bureau said employees immediately tried to determine who wrote it, but the shooting occurred before they could establish his identity.

1013,Indio police officer injures armed suspect in shooting; third such case in April,"CLOSE The Indio Police Department, CalFire and Desert Sands Unified School District conduct an active shooter training at Indio High School. Palm Springs Desert Sun

An Indio police officer wounded an armed domestic violence suspect who threatened to kill family members and police early Tuesday, a department spokesman said.

The shooting, which was the third involving officers this month, happened just after 5:30 a.m. at a home in the 81-200 block of Daffodil Court, which is in the southern portion of the city.

The suspect was being treated at Desert Regional Medical Center for a gunshot wound to a shoulder, police said. He is expected to survive, police Chief Mike Washburn said.

The suspect's name has not been released, but Washburn said he has a history of domestic violence and is known to police.

The suspect was described as the husband and father of the family occupying a home on Daffodil. Someone from inside the home dialed 911 and said the suspect ""would kill family and officers when they arrived,"" Indio police spokesman Ben Guitron said.

He was armed with a rifle when officers arrived, Guitron said. Police tried to subdue him using ""less-than-lethal"" means before efforts failed and an officer opened fire, he added.

The suspect returned to the home before going back outside, where he was detained.

The shooting was preceded by two others this month and Indio police said each one involved armed suspects.

""Those are unfortunately things where we can't always foresee what the outcomes are, especially when the suspect is armed,"" Guitron said. ""Whether they're going to hurt someone or not, we don't know.""

After several delays, a 76-year-old defendant pleaded not guilty to murdering a 75-year-old woman who was found dead in her Palm Springs home exactly a week earlier.

Stephen McKernan entered his plea Monday morning in Riverside County Superior Court. He was originally scheduled to be arraigned Thursday before unspecified medical issues pushed arraignment to Friday and again to Monday.

Court records also show Monday's arraignment involved a hearing regarding the defendant's court apparel.

McKernan is accused of killing Claire Carsman, whose body was discovered April 22 at her home on Pico Road. She suffered from ""significant trauma,"" according to Palm Springs police.

Investigators say McKernan called police to the home and they soon identified him as a suspect in Carsman's death.

Police described McKernan as a house guest who had known the victim and her husband for several years. But the victim's friend, who said she also was her former caretaker, told KESQ that there was no indication Carsman and McKernan knew each other.

Sgt. Mike Casavan reiterated on Monday that an investigation only showed McKernan was a friend and house guest.

Neighbors told The Desert Sun they didn't know Carsman and efforts to reach her husband have not been successful.

McKernan remained Monday at the Southwest Detention Center in Murrieta with bail set at $1 million.

The killing is the six homicide in Palm Springs this year, although four of them are related to one case.

The first occurred Jan. 20 in the Sun Center parking lot at South Palm Canyon Drive and Camino Parocela. A 21-year-old man from Desert Hot Springs and Arizona was killed and a 14-year-old Desert Hot Springs boy was injured.

No suspects were identified.

The other homicides happened Feb. 3 in the city's Demuth Park neighborhood.

Palm Springs police found three teens, who had been shot-to-death, inside a crashed Toyota Corolla at Sunny Dunes and El Placer roads. A fourth victim, who had also been fatally shot, was found a half-mile away outside his residence at Theresa and Canon drives.

Cathedral City resident Jose Larin-Garcia, 19, was arrested the next day at a Greyhound bus station in Indio.

1033,Andy Ruiz Jr. Replaces Jarrell Miller for Anthony Joshua Fight on June 1,"Yong Teck Lim/Getty Images

Andy Ruiz Jr. has been confirmed as Anthony Joshua's opponent for his United States debut at Madison Square Garden in New York on June 1.

Jarrell Miller had been scheduled to fight Joshua for his WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO heavyweight belts, but the American failed a drugs test and was denied a license for the fight.

Per Liam Prenderville of the Mirror, Joshua, 29, did not halt his fight preparations after Miller pulled out, and he said he welcomes the challenge posed by Ruiz:

""Ruiz is a different kind of challenge but one I embrace. We have worked in the boxing gym week on week and whomever is put in front of me at Madison Square Garden on June 1 will be dispatched in style. The rent will be collected.""

Richard Heathcote/Getty Images

Joshua's last fight was his seventh-round knockout of Russia's Alexander Povetkin last September, which took his professional record to 22-0 (21 KOs).

Ruiz, meanwhile, was last in action on April 20, when he beat Germany's Alexander Dimitrenko in his native California.

The 29-year-old has only lost once in his career, by majority decision to New Zealand's Joseph Parker in 2016 when the WBO heavyweight title was on the line.

Ruiz will go into the fight against Joshua as a big underdog, but the Englishman's promoter, Eddie Hearn, warned against any complacency:

ESPN's Dan Rafael believes it is the best fight that could have been made in the circumstances:

Joshua's rise through the heavyweight ranks to becoming a unified champion has been largely serene so far, with his biggest win to date arguably coming against Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in 2017.

A Tulare County man had been on the run for nearly two years. He's now on his way home and faces a slew of sexual assault allegations.

Buddy Joe Sabedra, 40, is charged with 16 counts, which were filed by Tulare County prosecutors in October 2017.

The Porterville man also faces multiple special allegations that there was more than one victim in the case. Prosecutors allege that Sabedra touched and had sexual intercourse with at least two children, one was under the age of under 14.

Sabedra has eluded Tulare County detectives since December 2016 but was recently captured in Southern California.

Detectives believe that Sebedra sexually abused one child between September 2010 and August 2016.

According to prosecutors, Sebedra began abusing a second victim in June 2014. That victim was 14 years old when the alleged abuse began.

Sabedra's relationship with the children is unknown.

The investigation into Sabedra began in December 2016, detectives said.

Deputies were called to the Tule River Reservation for a report of lewd and lascivious acts on a child.

Nearly a year after the December call, a $250,000 warrant was issued for Sabedra's arrest.

Sabedra has a history with law enforcement and has a prior assault and battery conviction. According to court records, after pleading to the charge, Sebedra never enrolled in a court-mandated anger management program.

On April 26, detectives began looking into the possibility of Sabedra hiding out in the San Diego area. Detectives reached out to the U.S. Marshals' Pacific Southwest Regional Fugitive Task Force for help.

Law enforcement scoured the area. Sabedra was eventually found at a home in the 4700 block of Wilson Street in San Diego.

He was arrested and booked into the San Diego County Jail and will be brought back to Tulare County.

If convicted, Sabedra faces life in prison.

1070,Rabbi recalls coming face-to-face with gunman: 'I couldn't see his soul',"(CNN) - It was the last day of Passover, one of the holiest days of the year, and Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein was preparing to lead a memorial service at Congregation Chabad in Poway, California, about 22 miles north of San Diego.

He had just spoken to Lori Kaye, a close family friend. She had come to the synagogue on Saturday to honor her mother, who had recently passed away, Goldstein said standing before a group of reporters, both of his hands bandaged.

Then he saw an unthinkable sight.

""Here is a young man, standing with a rifle pointing right at me,"" Goldstein recalled in a Sunday news conference. ""And I look at him. He had sunglasses on. I couldn't see his eyes. I couldn't see his soul.""

The 19-year-old gunman killed Kaye and wounded three others -- including an 8-year-old girl and her uncle, who was visiting from Israel.

The suspect in police custody has been identified as John Earnest, a student at California State University San Marcos. He was booked into San Diego Central Jail early Sunday on one count of first-degree murder and three counts of first-degree attempted murder, according to the San Diego Sheriff's Inmate Website.

Authorities are investigating a possible link between the suspected gunman and a case of arson at a mosque in nearby Escondido last month, according to San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore.

Investigators have determined that the suspect acted alone, Gore said Sunday.

One of downtown Redding's most used roads is getting ready to close for nearly a week.

A section of Placer Street will be closed for five days starting Wednesday so Union Pacific Railroad can replace all three tracks at its crossing there.

Placer Street between Court and California streets will be closed by 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday, said Randy Campbell, public works supervisor for the city of Redding.

After the tracks are replaced, Redding workers will repave the asphalt between the tracks, he said. The stretch of Placer should reopen about 4 p.m. on Monday, he said.

While the area is closed, motorists looking for alternate routes can use South, Yuba or Tehama streets, or the Eureka Way overpass, said Campbell.

Union Pacific completed a similar track replacement on South Street earlier this month.

Tracks at the Yuba Street crossing are also scheduled to be replaced in the future.

Fresno, California - Fresno County prosecutor Andrew Janz is ready to go head to head with Fresno Mayor Lee Brand.

Janz filed his paperwork last week. Janz lost his bid to unseat District 22 Congressman Devin Nunes in this last mid-term election.

The Democratic challenger is expected to make a public announcement on Thursday.

From the Mayor:

""I welcome the opportunity to have voters compare my well-earned experience and record of accomplishment, highlighted by creating over 5,000 good-paying jobs with benefits, to his complete lack of experience and a track record that consists of saying 'I'm not Devin Nunes.' Will his new campaign be 'I'm not Lee Brand'? To which I reply, ""Yes, young man, you’re right. You’re not Lee Brand. You aren't even close.'""

1089,Did armed man ruin Visalia Craft Beer Festival?,"Handcuffs And Fingerprints (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

After threatening a woman with a gun, crashing his car and trying to outrun police, a 25-year-old Visalia man is behind bars, according to Visalia detectives.

Around 5:30 p.m., officers were called to Mooney Grove Park. Visalia Craft Beer Festival was held at the park on Saturday and had just ended.

Witnesses said a man at the park had a gun. He may have also been intoxicated.

While officers were on their way, another caller told dispatchers the man was trying to leave the park in his car. The park closes at 7 p.m. and still had people in the park.

According to witnesses, the man hit a parked vehicle, got out and walked toward the driver inside the parked car.

The woman inside the vehicle said the man brought out a gun and threatened her. He then walked back to his car and sped away, police said.

The suspect was later identified as Adrian Vasquez. According to police, Vasquez is a convicted felon, which means he isn't legally allowed to own a gun.

He didn't get far.

While trying to escape, Vasquez lost control of his vehicle. The vehicle rolled over and Vasquez climbed out and tried to run away from police.

Agent Ramona Whaley said officers quickly spotted Vasquez running through the park. He became ""combative"" but was eventually arrested, Whaley said.

A gun and ammunition were found at the scene. Police didn't release the type of gun they found.

Vasquez was booked into Tulare County Pretrial Facility on suspicion of felony DUI, being a felon in possession of a firearm, brandishing a weapon and an arrest warrant.

His bail was set at $85,000. According to Tulare County Sheriff's Department inmate search, Vasquez has a prior DUI.

If anyone has information on the incident call Visalia Police Department at 734-8117.

The parents of a 19-year-old college student suspected of attacking a Southern California synagogue said Monday that they are shocked and saddened that ""he is now part of the history of evil that has been perpetrated on Jewish people for centuries.""John T. Earnest's parents said they raised him and his five siblings in a family, faith and community that rejected hate.""Our son's actions were informed by people we do not know, and ideas we do not hold,"" the parents said in a statement, which didn't include their names.A gunman on Saturday burst into the Chabad of Poway near San Diego on the last day of Passover, a major Jewish holiday that celebrates freedom, and opened fire with an assault-style rifle, killing a woman and wounding a rabbi and two others.""How our son was attracted to such darkness is a terrifying mystery to us, though we are confident that law enforcement will uncover many details of the path that he took to this evil and despicable act,"" the statement said.Earnest's parents, who are cooperating with investigators, said their sadness ""pales in comparison to the grief and anguish our son has caused for so many innocent people.""Earll Pott, a family attorney who issued the statement, said the parents will not provide a legal defense for their son, who will likely be represented by a public defender. They asked for privacy and do not plan to make additional comments until the criminal case is resolved.The FBI said Monday that it received tips on a threatening social media post about five minutes before the attack.The tips to the FBI's website and phone number included a link to the anonymous post but did not offer specific information about its author or the location of the threat. The FBI said employees immediately tried to determine who wrote the post, but the shooting occurred before they could establish his identity.One of the tipsters told The Associated Press that he called the FBI tip line at 11:15 a.m. Saturday because the post linked to a manifesto that said the author was responsible for a mosque arson in the city of Escondido last month. He says he found online that had the mosque attack had happened and feared the new threat was real.The tipster, who refused to provide his name because of security concerns, said the call with the FBI lasted four or five minutes and the shooting happened soon after. He described the FBI as quick and professional and said he doesn't know what they could have done.The shooting happened around 11:30 a.m., and police arrested Earnest moments afterward. He is being held on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.The online manifesto written by a person identifying himself as John Earnest was an anti-Jewish screed posted about an hour before the attack. The poster described himself as a nursing school student and praised the suspects accused of carrying out attacks on mosques in New Zealand that killed 50 people last month and at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue that killed 11 on Oct. 27.About 100 congregants were worshipping when the gunman killed Lori Kaye, 60, and wounded the synagogue's rabbi, Yishoel Goldstein; Noya Dahan, 8; and her uncle Almog Peretz.Goldstein said he was preparing for a service and heard a loud sound, turned around and a saw a young man wearing sunglasses standing in front of him with a rifle.""I couldn't see his eyes. I couldn't see his soul,"" Goldstein said. He raised his hands and lost one of his fingers in the shooting.And then, Goldstein said, ""miraculously the gun jammed.""In the moments that followed, Goldstein said he wrapped his bloodied hand in a prayer shawl and addressed congregants gathered outside the building, vowing to stay strong in the face of the deadly attack targeting his community.""We are a Jewish nation that will stand tall. We will not let anyone take us down. Terrorism like this will not take us down,"" Goldstein recalled telling the community.| RELATED | Security heightened at Sacramento synagogues after SoCal shootingAuthorities said Earnest had no previous contact with law enforcement and may face a hate crime charge in addition to homicide charges when he's in court later this week. He was being held without bail.Police searched Earnest's house in San Diego and said he was also being investigated in connection with an arson attack on a mosque in nearby Escondido, California, on March 24. California State University, San Marcos, confirmed that Earnest was a student who was on the dean's list.There were indications the AR-type assault weapon might have malfunctioned after the gunman fired numerous rounds inside, San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said. An off-duty Border Patrol agent fired at the shooter as he fled, missing him but striking the getaway vehicle, the sheriff said.Earnest called 911 to report the shooting, and when an officer found him on a roadway, he ""pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said.The rabbi described Kaye as a founding member of the congregation and said he was heartbroken by her death. He said the attack could have harmed many more people had the shooter turned toward the sanctuary where so many were praying.""Lori took the bullet for all of us,"" Goldstein said, his hands wrapped in bandages. ""She didn't deserve to die.""Friends described Kaye as giving, warm and attentive to community members on their birthdays and when they were sick. A wife and mother, she loved gardening and made delicious challah for her family and friends, said Roneet Lev, 55. Her funeral is planned for Monday.When the gunfire erupted, another worshipper, Shimon Abitbul, said he immediately placed his 2-year-old grandson on the floor and waited for a break in the shooting to grab the boy and sprint away.Abitbul, who was visiting from Israel and staying with his daughter and her family in Southern California, said he was still coming to grips with the carnage.""All of us are human beings,"" he said.

Visalia detectives say they are trying to protect a ""sensitive"" case.

Law enforcement was out in full force Friday and Saturday near Avenue 264 and Road 164, just outside of Visalia. The activity sparked interest from people who speculated on social media.

One nearby witness said a ""big pile of dirt"" was served during a search warrant. Nearby homeowners and businesses were notified, but few details were offered about the search warrant.

One witness said Visalia police and Tulare County detectives spent hours excavating an empty field behind a home in the area. Police dogs were used during the search, as well as a drone, witnesses said.

A backhoe, used to dig, could be seen from the roadway, witnesses said. A large hole was dug. According to officers, who asked to remain anonymous, officers were looking for bodies.

By Monday morning, law enforcement had cleared the area. It's unclear if officers found what they were looking for.

GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS REVEALED THE STATE FINDINGS LOOKING AT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IN A 58-PAGE REPORT, GOVERNOR NEWSOM OUTLINES HIS STRIKE-TEAM’S PLANS TO ADDRESS A HOST OF PROBLEMS RELATED TO WILDFIRES. CALIFORNIA COULD CREATE ITS OWN POWER-PURCHASING ENTITY TO CHANGE STANDARDS TO MAKE UTILITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR WILDFIRES. THEY ALSO WANT TO DISCOURAGE NEW HOUSING IN AREAS THAT ARE AT HIGH RISK TO WILDFIRES. TWO OF THE CALIFORNIA MOST DEADLY AND DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASONS IN HISTORY HIT DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS PER THE CAP

Advertisement California governor won't block building in high-fire areas Share Shares Copy Link Copy

A desire to live near nature is embedded in California's ethos, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday as he explained why he doesn't want to block home building near forested areas at high risk for wildfires.""There's something that is truly Californian about the wilderness and the wild and pioneering spirit,"" Newsom said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""I'm not advocating for no (building).""Newsom on Friday released a report outlining the challenges of California's growing wildfire threat that suggested local government ""de-emphasize"" building in high-risk areas around forests. But he told the AP it was a loose suggestion aimed at starting a debate about how Californians can build smarter and closer to urban centers and economic hubs.More than 2.7 million Californians live in areas state fire officials say are at a very high hazard for wildfires, according to an AP analysis of census data and state fire maps. Nearly 180 cities and towns are in those very high hazard areas.The recently retired head of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, Ken Pimlott, said last year that government should consider blocking construction in high-risk areas, given the devastating loss of property and lives.But Newsom said he's never seen a realistic proposal for how to do it.""I've never seen a deep analysis,"" he said. ""And I think one has to be cautious about that.""A wildfire that ripped through the Northern California town of Paradise last November, destroying 19,000 buildings and killing 85 people, served as a wake-up call on the need for immediate action as the climate warms and fires worsen. The town was considered at severe risk for wildfire.Newsom suggested the town's history dating to the 1800s is too deep to simply walk away.Instead he said Paradise should be rebuilt under more modern building codes and with a greater focus on sufficient evacuation routes and shelter-in-place plans. California has the nation's most robust building requirement programs for new homes in fire-prone areas, and a recent analysis by McClatchy showed that a higher percentage of homes built after new building codes took effect in 2008 survived the fire than those built before.Newsom's father, a former state appeals court judge, lived in Dutch Flat, a community on the edge of the Sierra Nevada range.""There's a frontier aspect, a historic component,"" Newsom said, referencing the phrase ""Go West, young man"" that is often attributed to author Horace Greeley, an advocate of westward expansion.The concept of local control is also deeply embedded in California's ethos and Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco, said he doesn't want to take away land-use planning power from local governments.He also suggests expanding housing in urban areas that have better access to transportation and jobs. California faces a crisis over housing affordability that has pushed more people beyond urban areas.""When I say de-emphasizing, it's loose,"" he said. ""It's about considering your environment literally and not just figuratively, and beginning to be more strategic about the planning.""Whether any of Newsom's ideas, such as encouraging local planners to include fire safety concerns in their general plans, will become law remains up to the Legislature.",https://www.kcra.com/article/california-gavin-newson-building-in-high-wildfire/27157841,2019-04-16T03:50:00Z,KCRA-TV,Couple,"3 Television Cir, Sacramento, CA 95814, USA",CA,95814
1132,'Film is forever:' Oakland-based actor Delroy Lindo pays tribute to the late John Singleton,"- Friends, colleagues and fans all over the world began to pay tribute to the career and legacy of film director John Singleton, who made one of Hollywood's most memorable debuts with the Oscar-nominated ""Boyz N the Hood"", and who died Monday at the age of 51 following a stroke.

Among those in mourning is Oakland-based actor and director Delroy Lindo.

In an interview early Tuesday by phone from Thailand with KTVU, Lindo said he admired Singleton as both a man and as an industry leader who continued throughout his decades-long career to probe the lives of black communities in his native Los Angeles and beyond.

""There's a term, that 'film is forever,' "" Lindo said. ""If you put it on film, it lasts forever. No matter what John's later films were, no nobody will ever be able to deny the impact of ""Boyz N the Hood"" and ""Poetic Justice.' ""

Lindo is filiming a new Spike Lee movie on the Vietnam War called ""Da 5 Bloods,"" and learned of Singleton's death from Lee himself.

Singleton was in his early 20s, just out of the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, when he wrote, directed and produced ""Boyz N the Hood."" Based on Singleton's upbringing and shot in his old neighborhood, the low-budget production starred Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ice Cube and centered on three friends in South Central Los Angeles, where college aspirations competed with the pressures of gang life. ""Boyz N the Hood"" was a critical and commercial hit, given a 20-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and praised as a groundbreaking extension of rap to the big screen, a realistic and compassionate take on race, class, peer pressure and family. Singleton would later call it a ""rap album on film.""

For many, the 1991 release captured the explosive mood in Los Angeles in the months following the videotaped police beating of Rodney King. ""Boyz N the Hood"" also came out at a time when, thanks to the efforts to Spike Lee and others, black films were starting to get made by Hollywood after a long absence.

Singleton became the first black director - and at 24 the youngest - to receive an Academy Award nomination, an honor he would say was compensation for the academy's snubbing Lee and ""Do the Right Thing"" two years earlier, and was nominated for best screenplay. (""Thelma & Louise"" won instead.)

1141,"'Lori took the bullet for all of us,' says Chabad rabbi of the woman who died in synagogue shooting","Congregant Lori Kaye, 60, (left) was killed in the Chabad of Poway shooting on April 26, 2019 Congregant Lori Kaye, 60, (left) was killed in the Chabad of Poway shooting on April 26, 2019

- Eight-year-old Noya Dahan had finished praying and gone to play with other children at her Southern California synagogue when gunshots rang out. Her uncle grabbed her and the other children, leading them outside to safety as her leg bled from a shrapnel wound.

""I was scared, really, really scared,"" said Noya, recalling how the group of children cried out of fear after a gunman entered Chabad of Poway on Saturday morning and opened fire. ""I didn't see my dad. I thought he was dead.""

The onslaught on the last day of Passover, a Jewish holiday celebrating freedom, wounded Dahan, her uncle Almog Peretz and the congregation's rabbi. The attack killed beloved congregant Lori Kaye, 60.

Authorities said the 19-year-old gunman opened fire as about 100 people were worshipping exactly six months after a mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue.

Rabbi Yishoel Goldstein said he was preparing for a service and heard a loud sound, turned around and a saw a young man wearing sunglasses standing in front of him with a rifle.

""I couldn't see his eyes. I couldn't see his soul,"" Goldstein said. He raised his hands and lost one of his fingers in the shooting.

And then, Goldstein said, ""miraculously the gun jammed.""

In the moments that followed, Goldstein said he wrapped his bloodied hand in a prayer shawl and addressed congregants gathered outside the building, vowing to stay strong in the face of the deadly attack targeting his community.

""We are a Jewish nation that will stand tall. We will not let anyone take us down. Terrorism like this will not take us down,"" Goldstein recalled telling the community.

Authorities said suspect John T. Earnest, who had no previous contact with law enforcement, may face a hate crime charge in addition to homicide charges when he's arraigned later this week. He was being held without bail, and it was unclear if he had an attorney.

Police searched Earnest's house and said he was also being investigated in connection with an arson attack on a mosque in nearby Escondido, California, on March 24.

There were indications an AR-type assault weapon might have malfunctioned after the gunman fired numerous rounds inside, San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said. An off-duty Border Patrol agent fired at the shooter as he fled, missing him but striking the getaway vehicle, the sheriff said.

Shortly after fleeing, Earnest called 911 to report the shooting, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said. When an officer reached him on a roadway, ""the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" he said.

Goldstein described Kaye as a pioneering founding member of the congregation and said he was heartbroken by her death. He said the attack could have harmed many more people had the shooter turned toward the sanctuary where so many were praying.

""Lori took the bullet for all of us,"" the rabbi said, his hands wrapped in bandages. ""She didn't deserve to die.""

He said that Kaye's physician husband was called to tend to a wounded worshipper and fainted when he realized it was his wife.

Friends described Kaye as giving, warm and attentive to community members on their birthdays and when they were sick. A wife and mother, she loved gardening and made delicious challah for her family and friends, said Roneet Lev, 55.

When the gunfire erupted, another worshipper, Shimon Abitbul, said he immediately placed his 2-year-old grandson on the floor and waited for a break in the shooting to grab the boy and sprint away.

Abitbul, who was visiting from Israel and staying with his daughter and her family in Southern California, said he was still coming to grips with the carnage.

""All of us are human beings,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter if you are Jews or Christians or Muslims.""

Peretz, who was wounded in the leg, said he turned around after hearing gunfire and saw the shooter standing by the door. He grabbed his niece by the hand and carried out another child.

He then saw a group of children and got them running, ""I tell them, 'go this way, go this way,"" said Peretz, who is visiting from Israel.

Gore said authorities were reviewing Earnest's social media posts, including what he described as a ""manifesto."" There was no known threat after Earnest was arrested, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship Saturday and again on Sunday as a precaution, police said.

A person identifying himself as John Earnest posted an anti-Jewish screed online about an hour before the attack. The poster described himself as a nursing school student and praised the suspects accused of carrying out deadly attacks on mosques in New Zealand last month that killed 50 and at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, in which 11 people were killed.

""It was a hate crime, no doubt about it,"" national security adviser John Bolton said on ""Fox News Sunday."" He said investigators have not seen any connection between the suspect and other extremist groups.

California State University, San Marcos, confirmed that Earnest was a student who was on the dean's list and said the school was ""dismayed and disheartened"" that he was suspected in ""this despicable act.""

Goldstein said President Donald Trump called him to share condolences on behalf of the American people.

The White House acknowledged the call. ""The President expressed his love for the Jewish people and the entire community of Poway,"" Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement.

On Sunday night, hundreds of people gathered at a park for a vigil to honor the victims.

People at the community park near Chabad synagogue in Poway held candles and listened to prayer in Hebrew. Leaders asked community members to do acts of kindness to remember Kaye.

Poway Mayor Steve Vaus said he would stand with the community, and Rabbi Goldstein said seeing the crowd come together provided consolation.

""What happened to us, happened to all of us,"" Goldstein said.

1144,"At Stagecoach, Jason Aldean finishes song he couldn't complete at Route 91 festival","You couldn't tell Jason Aldean had taken six months off by the sound of his tight band and powerful vocals.

Aldean headlined Sunday evening at Stagecoach 2019 in front of tens of thousands of fans on a cool spring night. A few songs in, he admitted he's been spending a lot of time with family lately but wouldn't let the break hinder him from giving his fans a performance to remember.

In a cowboy hat and plaid short-sleeve button-up, Aldean — who previously headlined the festival in 2014 — kicked off with classics like ""Tattoos on This Town"" and ""Fly Over States.""

Day 3: Stagecoach rolls to satisfying end, while some fans call for larger second stage

Day 2: Record-breaking Stagecoach crowd estimated at 80,000, embraces family in all of its forms

Day 1: Stagecoach 2019 opens with a celebration of beer, country music, Western heritage and more beer

While the night was one of celebration, including for the Route 91 shooting victims, it also was one of exploration with Aldean showcasing songs from his entire career.

Here are the biggest takeaways from Aldean's set:

Route 91 shoutout

Sunday night was Aldean's first headlining performance here since the Route 91 mass shooting in Las Vegas. During his 2017 set, a gunman opened fire on the crowd, killing 58 and wounding hundreds more.

Aldean acknowledged the large Route 91 crowd in attendance about midway through his set.

More: Bret Michaels review: The five major moments from former Poison front man's set

He then said he wanted to finish ""When She Says Baby,"" a song he didn't complete at the Vegas show because it was interrupted by the shooting.

The song received exceptionally loud applause after he finished.

Rock isn't dead

When you buy a ticket to California's premier country festival, you don't expect to get treated to a rock show.

Aldean, one of country's premier voices, proved rock isn't dead with songs like ""Big Green Tractor"" and ""Crazy Town."" With blistering guitar solos and bluesy licks complementing Aldean's vocals, it felt like fans were witnessing an artist who saw the value in country music for its unique lyrical perspective and rock for its ability to unite everyone.

The anthems, Gibson Les Paul guitars and smooth bass licks felt less like your mom and dad's country and more like something new, a country-rock hybrid that recognizes the two are more similar than different.

If you don't rely on a little bit of rock, how else can you get people to believe in the (outdoor) stadium experience?

Aldean crafted a set with pacing reminiscent of something you might see from Bruce Springsteen.

Popular to everyone

Sometimes an artist's fans are only of a certain age or generation, and their ability to reach backward or forward to grab more fans is difficult.

That's a problem Aldean doesn't seem to have.

Whether it's a teenager being hoisted on some man's shoulders, or the parents and grandparents, everyone at the festival looked to be a fan.

It showed in his songs, too.

There were your barn-burners (""Gettin' Warmed Up""), introspective thinkers (""Rearview Town"") and others with just enough country twang to remind you where you were.

One young man jumped on a platform about halfway down the field up to get as close to one of the screens as possible. Another woman serving lemonade danced in between sets while a middle-aged couple swayed — a rare sight to see.

1155,KTTV 70: Local targets of hate crime relive their horror after Poway synagogue shooting,"- Our KTTV 70 series has been looking back at the biggest moments from the past 70 years in Los Angeles. Due to what happened in Poway this weekend, we wanted to bring you this story now. Two amazing young adults-- who saw first-hand-- what anti-Semitism can do.

Laura Diaz takes us back to 1999 and the North Valley JCC shooting.

I have been working the KTTV 70 story about the horrific shooting that occurred the morning of August 10, 1999, in the quiet suburban neighborhood of Granada Hills. That was the day a white supremacist opened fire with a semi-automatic weapon on the ""North Valley Jewish Community Center.""

The assailant pumped 70 shots into the complex. The gunfire injured five people, including three children, a teenage counselor, and an office worker. He unleashed this terror because those who gathered at the center were Jewish.

To this day, I remember the iconic image of the tiny children holding hands, some even smiling, as law enforcement led them to safety and to the waiting arms of their frantic parents. It made me cry then. And it makes me cry now. Over the years, I have interviewed two survivors in particular. Joshua Stepakoff and Mindy Finkelstein.

Continue reading below

Josh was just six years old then and the tiny figure you see being rushed out on a gurney. He was so young, that it's taken him years to fully grasp how close he was to death. And that the man who did this-- hated him because of his religion. Over the years, he's had time to process what occurred to him as small child and it hurts. Today almost 20 years later, he is a passionate advocate for gun control. He is engaged to be married.

Mindy Finkelstein was a teen counselor in 1999. She described herself to me as a carefree teenager growing up in the San Fernando Valley. And then Buford Furrow attacked the Jewish Community Center.

He shattered her sense of innocence and her sense of safety. Gone in an instant.

Today Mindy is a young mom. And she worries about the world in which her young daughter will grow up.

And then it happened again, last Saturday. This time, the quiet community of Poway, near San Diego is stunned by an attack on a synagogue, during a service on the last day of Passover. The gunman opens fire, while yelling anti- Semitic slurs. A woman is killed, others sustain injuries.

I spoke to Mindy and Josh today. Both we shaken by the hate crime in Poway, but not surprised. It dredged up there own terror of almost twenty years ago.

Both would like to see Congress show the political might to limit these type of weapons. And while they are disgusted by the shooter ...Josh told me ""Sadly, things are worse today than they were when I was growing up.""",http://www.foxla.com/news/local-news/kttv-70-local-targets-of-hate-crime-relive-their-horror-after-poway-synagogue-shooting,2019-04-30T05:38:33Z,FOX LA,Couple,"1999 S Bundy Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90025, USA",CA,90025
1161,Palm Springs police murder trial ends second week with dramatic testimony,"CLOSE David and Luanne Kling talk about their year after their daughter, Palm Springs police officer Lesley Zerebny, was killed in an ambush.

The second week in the trial of John Hernandez Felix, the Palm Springs man facing the death penalty for the shooting deaths of two Palm Springs Police officers in 2016, has come to an end after dramatic testimony from officers who survived the deadly shootout and a firearms investigator testifying the murder weapon was likely stolen.

The trial began on April 17, with the prosecution describing in graphic detail the allegations that Felix used an AR15 to fire more than 20 rounds at Palm Springs police officers who had arrived at his house around noon on Oct. 8, 2016, in response to a domestic dispute call.

Officers Jose Vega and Lesley Zerebny were killed and several other officers were injured in the shooting that ended in Felix’s arrest by SWAT officers after a 12-hour standoff.

On Monday, several officers who survived the shootout testified, including Officer Dave Etchason who helped retrieve the two officers after they had been shot.

“I pulled my car up into the driveway in the front lawn,” Etchason said about the attempt to retrieve Zerebny. “As I'm getting out, that's when there was a rupture of gunfire that occurred.”

Etchason, then 23-years-old, dragged Zerebny's body to his police car and put her in the trunk. He hoped there was still a chance to get Zerebny medical attention, but it was too late. One of the shooter’s bullets had penetrated her protective vest and caused fatal injuries to her vital organs.

Vega was also evacuated while the shooter was still barricaded in the house, but died of a gunshot wound that punctured his lung soon after.

On Tuesday, Officer Mario Serrano testified about the role he played in the attempt to evacuate the injured officers from the line of fire.

Serrano, who had only been on the force for two months when the shooting occurred, said he helped provide cover fire as other officers grabbed Vega’s body. When the officers had pulled Vega back to the patrol car, Serrano got inside and pulled the injured officer on top of him.

“I was letting him know that we were here and we were getting him help,” Serrano said. “It felt like hours. It felt like forever.''

On Wednesday, Riverside County Sheriff’s Investigator Dan Moody testified that Felix was wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying 26 rounds of live ammunition when he was arrested by SWAT officers.

Deputy Adam Ball was a member of the SWAT team that made the arrest. They used teargas to drive Felix from the house he had been barricaded in for hours and shot him with non-lethal beanbag rounds when he did not comply after exiting. Ball testified that Felix made threatening remarks to the arresting officers, saying he’d seen their faces and that they’d be next.

On Thursday, Riverside County Sheriff’s Investigator Steven Paixao testified that the serial number on the AR15 used by the shooter was “obliterate” — meaning it was likely a stolen weapon, owned illegally.

Defense attorney John Dolan has attempted to convince the jury that Felix had no intent to kill anyone, with his history of family neglect, low educational achievements, drug abuse and an intellectual disability, all adding up to a lack of premeditation.

Dolan said the surrounding circumstances show that “factually, this is immature, angry, emotional, impulsive behavior.”

Deputy District Attorney Manny Bustamante, on the other hand, has said throughout the trial that there is clear evidence of premeditation and intent.

The 911 call, made by Felix's mother, included audio of the defendant helping his mother give the dispatcher the family's address. The call has been referenced several times during testimony and a recording has been played for the jury.

Bustamante claimed the defendant helped his mother with the address “so she could tell 911 where the officers should go to,” and that Felix planned to kill them when they arrived.

Felix’s trial is scheduled to resume on Monday.

Riverside County District Attorney's spokesman John Hall said more investigators will testify early in the week. Two witnesses dealing with travel issues will testify out of order during the defense, which could begin mid-week, he said.

Fiery crash near Escalon claims life

ESCALON — A person died in a two-vehicle collision Sunday afternoon northwest of Escalon, the California Highway Patrol reported.

The vehicles, a silver Infiniti and a white Ford Fusion, collided at Mariposa and Dodds roads, both two-lane country roads where Mariposa has the right of way. The accident was reported at 12:45 p.m.

In initial reports, one of the vehicles was on fire. A vehicle hit a utility pole, but the pole remained upright. No victim information or circumstances of the collision were provided in the early report.

After threatening a woman with a gun, crashing his car and trying to outrun police, a 25-year-old Visalia man is behind bars, according to Visalia detectives.

Around 5:30 p.m., officers were called to Mooney Grove Park. Witnesses said a man at the park had a gun. He may have also been intoxicated.

While officers were on their way, another caller told dispatchers the man was trying to leave the park in his car. The park closes at 7 p.m. and still had people in the park.

According to witnesses, the man hit a parked vehicle, got out and walked toward the driver inside the parked car.

The woman inside the vehicle said the man brought out a gun and threatened her. He then walked back to his car and sped away, police said.

The suspect was later identified as Adrian Vasquez. According to police, Vasquez is a convicted felon, which means he isn't legally allowed to own a gun.

He didn't get far.

While trying to escape, Vasquez lost control of his vehicle. The vehicle rolled over and Vasquez climbed out and tried to run away from police.

Agent Ramona Whaley said officers quickly spotted Vasquez running through the park. He became ""combative"" but was eventually arrested, Whaley said.

A gun and ammunition were found at the scene. Police didn't release the type of gun they found.

Vasquez was booked into Tulare County Pretrial Facility on suspicion of felony DUI, being a felon in possession of a firearm, brandishing a weapon and an arrest warrant.

If anyone has information on the incident call Visalia Police Department at 734-8117.

A baby sea lion, perhaps in pursuit of pancakes at a nearby Denny's, wandered onto Highway 101 in South San Francisco Tuesday morning before being corralled to safety.CHP received a call at 8:34 a.m. that a marine mammal was on 101 North near South Airport Boulevard, stopping multiple vehicles as alarmed motorists tried to shoo the sea lion to safety. With one car putting on its flashers to warn oncoming traffic, another man got out of his car to try to ""herd the mammal with a handkerchief.""Unsurprisingly, this well-intentioned maneuver did not work. The determined little critter soldiered on.Within minutes, CHP had arrived on the scene and took over the task of getting the sea lion off the road. Video taken by KGO shows the wayward sea lion bobbing its head in the back of a CHP patrol vehicle, the world's cutest perp, while a bemused officer looks on. After getting the animal safely off the road, it was transported to the Peninsula Humane Society. It's likely the sea lion came from the nearby Colma Creek, which connects up with the bay.""Today's rescue of a California sea lion is a great example of the importance of members of the public giving our rescue hotline a call to report a marine mammal in distress,"" said Dr. Cara Field, staff veterinarian at the Marine Mammal Center. ""This action allows our expert veterinary team to provide immediate supportive care and give this sea lion a second chance at life.""A trained responder from the Marine Mammal Center will be transporting the sea lion to their center in Sausalito where it will be assessed by veterinarians.

1190,Massive manhunt underway near Auberry after deputy-involved shooting,"AUBERRY, california - A 30-year-old man is behind bars after ramming into a deputy's patrol car Saturday morning.

Robert Campos of Riverdale is accused of evading a Fresno County Sheriff's deputy around 10:30 a.m. and ramming the front of the patrol car in the area of Auberry and Tollhouse roads.

Campos caused little damage to the car and the deputy was not hurt. So the chase continued into Pine Ridge elementary School, with Campos crashing into an embankment.

""As he got out of the car to run, the deputy saw Campos reach into his waistband. Fearing he was retrieving a weapon, the deputy fired shots at him. Campos ran out of sight, into an area covered with

trees and bushes,"" Fresno County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Tony Botti explained.

He was not struck by the gunfire and made a temporary escape from the scene.

A K-9 unit and California Highway Patrol helicopter, H-40, were called to the scene to set up a perimeter to contain Campos. Around 12:15 p.m., a K-9 officer alerted deputies to an area about 100 yards from the suspect’s car.

Once the dog got closer, Campos came out from hiding in the brush and surrendered. He was taken into custody without any problems, Botti says.

A weapon was not found on him at the time of his arrest.

He's been booked into the Fresno County Jail and is facing charges of evading police, assault with a deadly weapon and probation violation.

This remains an ongoing investigation. Anyone with additional information about the suspect is asked to contact the sheriff’s office at 559-600-3111, Crime Stoppers at 559-498-7867 or www.valleycrimestoppers.org You will remain anonymous and may receive a cash reward.

Two of the festival’s top early evening acts, Jordan Davis on the Mane Stage and Mark Chesnutt in the Palomino tent, called in sick, so artists in both of those venues started their sets late to keep the headliners on track for the record crowds that mostly arrived after 5 p.m.

Mane Stage headliner Jason Aldean was expected to close Stagecoach at 11 p.m. while British pop legend Tom Jones went on at 7 p.m. in the Palomino, as scheduled, with his mix of ‘60s nostalgia and a repertoire including blues, country, gospel and Prince songs.

Lauren Alaina, the “American Idol” 2011 runner-up to Friday performer Scotty McCreery, got the Stagecoach ride back on schedule on the Mane Stage with an entertaining 6:20 p.m. set, aided by a man she singled out from the audience because he was wearing a fanny pack. She brought him up to sing “Next Boyfriend.” When he knew all the lyrics, she let him sing some of the song. She then came back with her hit, “Ladies in the ‘90s,” keeping the crowd of possibly 50,000 people by that point fully engaged as the ‘Coach rolled on to its biggest modern country stars, Old Dominion and Aldean.

Fans flocked during the daytime to beer bars, such as the saloons on both sides of the Mane Stage, and air-conditioned sites such as the Opry Gallery and the Honky Tonk Dance Hall, where people did popular dance steps to music by country DJs.

But, on the Sirius XM Spotlight Stage, 21-year-old Texas singing sensation Abby Anderson got her limited audience dancing in the humid weather at 1:30 p.m., which thrilled her.

Wearing oversized pink sunglasses and a red bare-midriff outfit with matching high-heeled shoes, Anderson drawled, “Y’all willing to dance with us today? A little sweaty.”

Anderson has been touted as “the next Kacey Musgraves,” but she demonstrated more personality than her fellow Texan on her own song, “Dance Away My Broken Heart.” Then she kept the audience dancing with a cover of Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.”

Parker Millsap is another up-and-comer with high expectations, having performed with and been touted by Elton John. He’s been compared to “a young Elvis” and he showed flashes of that on his gospel-rocker, “Heaven Sent.” He’s 26 from Oklahoma, playing with the basic rock configuration of two guitars, bass guitar and drums. But the band jammed out on “Let A Little Light In.” Millsap showed a sensitive side on “Gotta Get To You.”

Some of the best music of this festival was performed in the Palomino tent. A weekend highlight was Lynyrd Skynyrd Saturday evening in a stop on a farewell tour that began in January 2018. The band thrilled an overflow crowd of maybe 10,000 people with anthems such as “Tuesday’s Gone” and “Gimme Three Steps,” exceeding the emotional pitch they generated in their 2014 appearance that set the precedent for having at least one major Southern rock band at every Stagecoach.

Their song, “Sweet Home Alabama” was appropriated by Kid Rock in his 2008 anthem, “All Summer Long,” and the original has come to symbolize the divide between red and blue states after originally becoming popular in the 1970s as a rebuttal to Neil Young’s condemning, “Southern Man.” Singer Johnny Van Zant, whose brother, original Skynyrd vocalist Ronnie Van Zant, died in the 1977 airplane crash that decimated the band, got to the controversial part of the song about Young putting down the Southern man, and asked the crowd, “What do you say, California?” The audience sang back, “Southern man don’t need him around anyhow.”

The band returned for an encore of their classic “Free Bird,” even though their set time was supposed to be up, and left the crowd walking way astonished at an historic Stagecoach moment.

“Lynyrd Skynyrd was just great,” said Curt Shupe of Palm Desert. “There’s always a lot of emotion about Lynyrd Skynyrd because of their tragic past, but the crowd was electric.”

Shupe didn’t think the Palomino was as overcrowded for Skynyrd as the Sahara tent at Coachella has been for artists at that festival. But other Stagecoach festivalgoers thought the set should have been held in the Sahara, now occupied by the youth-oriented Half-Pint Hootenanny. Longtime Coachella and Stagecoach attendee Ryan Edgmon walked away from the Skynyrd show because he thought it was presented in the wrong location.

“Honestly, we didn’t watch because of how packed it was and we had the guest pass (allowing entrance from the back side),” said Edgmon. “It was a huge oversight to have them in the Palomino. (I) heard people saying it all night.”

Jones attracted another full tent in the Palomino, adding credence to the argument that major non-modern country artists possibly belong in a bigger Stagecoach venue. But an up-and-coming Southern rock band that played the Palomino on Saturday, Whiskey Myers from Texas, was pleased to have that tent for alternative country artists, traditional country performers and Southern rockers of all levels of accomplishment.

“When we played it, it was completely full,” said band singer-guitarist Cody Cannon. “I think it's badass. The lineup's cool. We were playing with Sammy Kershaw and Lynyrd Skynyrd. That's more of our vibe anyway.”

Even though there were more than 75,000 people per day at the festival, changes in the layout of the Empire and neighboring Eldorado polo clubs kept the walking traffic flowing more freely. The three-day festival maintained a safe, family vibe, despite all the beer-drinking, with signs on information booths advising festivalgoers to “ask for consent.”

For many, it was a way to reconnect and recharge with family and friends.

“It’s a chance to hang out with my friend since childhood,” said Tom Chila of Long Beach, standing with his buddy, Tom Minor of La Verne.

“It’s something to look forward to,” added Minor. “Otherwise, I’d stay at home and take care of the yard.”

POWAY (CNN) - A man was detained for questioning after reports of a shooting at a synagogue in the California city of Poway, according to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department's Twitter account on Saturday.

The synagogue is Congregation Chabad, CNN affiliate KGTV reported.

The Palomar Medical Center Poway received four patients from the shooting, according to a hospital spokeswoman. Their conditions are unknown.

Poway Mayor Steve Vaus said the congregation was targeted by ""someone with hate in their heart ... towards our Jewish community and that just will not stand.""

Synagogue shooting - man detained for...

He told CNN, ""I also understand from folks on the scene that this shooter was engaged by people in the congregation and those brave people certainly prevented this from being a much worse tragedy.""

KGTV reported that a witness heard six or seven shots followed by screams and then another volley of shots. The witness said the rabbi tried to calm the gunman and members of the congregation even after the rabbi was wounded, the station reported.

The San Diego Police Department is assisting sheriff's deputies with the incident, according to a tweet from Chief David Nisleit.

""No known threats however in an abundance of caution, we will be providing extra patrol at places of worship,"" Nisleit said.

Deputies were called to the synagogue about 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET). The synagogue's Facebook page said a Passover celebration was scheduled for 11 a.m.

Passover, one of the holiest Jewish celebrations of the year, ends Saturday.

The incident comes months six months to the day after the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.

On October 27, Robert Bowers stormed the synagogue, killing 11 people in what the Anti-Defamation League said was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in US history.A federal law enforcement official said at the time that Bowers made anti-Semitic statements during the shooting and targeted Jews on social media.

The Chabad of Poway website said the congregation is a center for Jewish people of all backgrounds. It was established in 1986.

Poway, about 20 miles north of San Diego, has about 48,000 residents. It is an upper-middle-class community that calls itself ""The City in the Country."" The city website said it has one of the lowest crime rates in the state.

Packing the Palomino

Lynyrd Skynyrd made an argument for moving big, non-modern country acts to what Coachella calls the Sahara tent with their powerful performance Saturday in the Palomino. I’ve seen Skynyrd many times since first watching their original incarnation in 1974, and I’ve always thought their 2014 Palomino show (their last Stagecoach show despite what singer Johnny Van Zant said from the stage) was their strongest. But, with the emotion of this being a return engagement on their farewell tour, this performance topped them all. Their classic hits took on anthem status. When Van Zant got to the line in “Sweet Home Alabama” rebutting Neil Young’s attack of Southern cultur in “Southern Man,” he simply asked the audience, “What do you say California?” and the overflow crowd shouted back, “Southern man don’t need him around anyhow.”

There was some question about whether they’d perform “Free Bird,” one of the great encore songs of all time. They were well past their allotted performance time. But, after a prolonged break, the band came back and knocked it out of the park. It was a celebration of a great band, an influential era and a magnificent song, and there probably wasn’t another Stagecoach moment to top it. — Bruce Fessier

Some fun under that oversized bandana

Bret Michaels, the former frontman for Poison, played an energetic set on Friday, rolling through Poison hits and just generally loving life on the stage for about an hour. While almost every act at Stagecoach took time out to thank the military and first responders, Michaels took it a step further.

Volcanic activity

I'd never been to PDTiki, the secret tiki bar on the Empire Polo Club grounds — until now. On our first day at the festival, we walked the grounds in search of the smoking volcano. And we found it. There was a bar and plenty of outdoor seating.

Cocktails included the Pineapple Parkside, with lemon and mint, as well as a Mezcal Mule with passion fruit, ginger, lime, cucumber and chili spice. There was also tons of Beautycounter sunscreen to go around. The best part? We found the (even more) secret indoor bar, and may or may not have had a Pineapple Parkside ... or two. — Kristin Scharkey

Alcoholic ingenuity

I was awestruck by how creative Stagecoach campers were when it came to alcohol. There were pop-up wooden saloons, giant drinking games and a guy shooting some type of beer from a squirt gun at everyone who passed by his trailer. Normally someone spraying beer at me isn't exactly how I envision spending a Saturday afternoon, but in this case the friendly gesture felt light-hearted and fun since it happened to everyone who walked past. As someone who covered the first weekend of Coachella, it's easy to say Stagecoach campers are better at partying in almost every single way. — Shane Newell

Yum-town population: Me

The food was pleasantly pleasing. The chicken barbecue tacos on soft flour tortillas with homemade barbecue salsa were worth the $18 price tag. The cookie monster ice cream from Afters hit the spot when I needed a comforting sugar buzz — the cookie chunks were so large and scrumptious, I couldn't even complain that it turned my mouth Cookie Monster blue. Additionally, the standard luke-warm chicken strips fueled my late-night energy when I thought I was too weak to carry on. — Nicole Hayden

A tasty ""dessert""

Have you ever had a ""Redneck Sundae""? It's a plastic cup that you might get a normal ice cream parfait in, but instead it's filled with (starting at the bottom) beans, pulled pork, corn, beef, chicken, cole slaw and a big piece of pork belly. Each section is separated by a small piece of tortilla. I almost ate it, but I don't do beans. Maybe if the bottom was rice instead (or just more meat) and each layer had some guac as the separation substance, I might have gone for it. I guess I just don't like desserts. — Shad Powers

Old Dominion graduates

It was a treat to see Old Dominion take the Mane Stage in a primetime spot during the final day of the festival. The first time the group performed at Stagecoach, in 2016, their hit ""Snapback"" was moving toward the top of the charts. Since they were an up-and-comer, they were assigned a not-so-great performance slot on the Mane Stage in the early afternoon. It's always fun to have the opportunity to shoot photos of a favorite group, and I remember how spirited and engaging they were with the relatively small (daytime) crowd. They played like they were performing in front of a packed house.

On Sunday night, Old Dominion brought that same energy and enthusiasm to the stage, and this time, they were welcomed by an estimated 60,000 eager fans. Just as in 2016, I got to shoot the band from the photo pit and as the set started, lead singer Matthew Ramsey bounded onto the stage and out onto the stage extension, where he performed just feet away from a cheering crowd. I was grateful I got to see the band up close again, and I smiled and swayed as the shutter of my camera clicked away. — Denise Goolsby

POWAY (CNN) - Authorities say a woman has died and three others are hospitalized in stable condition after a shooting at a synagogue outside San Diego.

San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said at a news conference that a white man entered Chabad of Poway on Saturday and opened fire on worshippers with an AR-type assault weapon.

Gore says an off-duty Border Patrol agent believed to be inside the synagogue shot at the suspect as he fled.

The sheriff says the agent didn't hit him but struck his car. San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit says the 19-year-old suspect called police to report the shooting and a California Highway Patrol officer heard it on a police scanner, saw the suspect and pulled him over.

Nisleit says the suspect got out of his car with his hands up and he was taken into custody without incident.

Gore says a woman died from her injuries, while a girl and two men are in the hospital.

POWAY (CNN) - A man was in custody after a shooting at a synagogue in the California city of Poway left at least one person dead and several others wounded, Mayor Steve Vaus said Saturday.

The shooting, which Vaus described as a possible hate crime, occurred at Congregation Chabad on the last day of Passover.

The Palomar Medical Center Poway received four patients from the shooting, according to a hospital spokeswoman.

Vaus said the three people who were wounded have non-life-threatening injuries.

He said he considered it a hate crime ""because of statements that were made when the shooter entered.""

""I also understand from folks on the scene that this shooter was engaged by people in the congregation and those brave people certainly prevented this from being a much worse tragedy,"" Vaus told CNN.

Congregation member Minoo Anvari, who said her husband witnessed the shooting, said the rabbi called for unity and prayed for peace even after getting shot.

""Rabbi said, 'We are united,'"" said Anvari, a refugee from Iran.

""This is something bad (that) is happening all over. And we have to believe that this bad thing is real and we don't have to ignore it. We have to open our eyes. He prayed for peace. I respect him -- even in spite of being injured he refused to go to hospital and he spoke. And he finished his speech and he then left the synagogue.""

Anvari said her husband told her the shooter was screaming and cursing when he opened fire.

A witness told CNN affiliate KGTV there were six or seven shots followed by screams and then another volley of shots. The witness said the wounded rabbi tried to calm the gunman and members of the congregation.

Palm Springs Mayor Robert Moon served in the United States Navy for 26 years. He remained silent about his sexual orientation for his entire service, including after he married his husband.

When he deployed to sea, Moon recalled, he and his husband, Bob Hammack, had to conceal their relationship in the letters they sent back and forth across the world.

“We couldn’t write anything personal, because someone could read those letters,” Moon said. “We could only say, ‘how’s the cat? How’s the dog?’ If someone saw a letter and read it, I could be thrown out.”

Moon shared this story on Saturday morning, during a ceremony to designate the LGBTQ Veterans Memorial at the Desert Memorial Park cemetery in Cathedral City as an official state memorial. California is now the first state in the nation to have an official memorial honoring gay veterans. He called the designation ""very personal.""

The state bestowed the designation on the memorial in 2018, seven years after the Obama Administration ended the ""don’t ask, don’t tell"" policy, which barred openly gay, lesbian or bisexual people from military service. During Saturday's ceremony, veterans and officials celebrated this milestone, while also criticizing a Trump Administration policy, effective this month, that effectively bars transgender people from joining the military.

Rancho Mirage resident Tom Swann Hernandez, an LGBTQ advocate who served in the U.S. Marine Corps and Naval Air Reserve, led the effort to create the memorial. The obelisk, which is engraved with an eagle and a pink triangle, was erected in 2001.

Since then, Swann Hernandez, now the post commander of Amvets Post 66, has worked to get the state to officially recognize the memorial. He said the state memorial belongs in the Coachella Valley because it is “a paradise for LGBTQ vets.”

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed such a bill in 2004. Nearly 15 years later, State Assemblyman Eduardo Garcia tried again, authoring another bill that created the state designation. Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill, A.B. 2439, in August 2018.

On Saturday morning, Garcia called the designation “a long-overdue recognition.”

“It’s a way for us to make a wrong right in our nation’s history,” Garcia said.

As the Desert Winds Freedom Band, a self-described group of gay and gay-friendly musicians, played songs like ‘God Bless America,’ Swann Hernandez, gay veterans and elected officials revealed a new plaque — reading: California LGBTQ Veterans Memorial — that had been affixed to the memorial.

Among the elected officials at the ceremony were Congressman Mark Takano, Assemblyman Chad Mayes and Cathedral City Mayor Mark Carnevale. Local philanthropist Harold Matzner provided funding for the ceremony.

Vito Imbasciani, secretary of the state Department of Veterans Affairs, said the commemoration of the memorial was “deeply personal,” explaining that he is a member of the LGBTQ community and served in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army for 27 years, much of it under ‘don’t ask, don’t tell.”

The memorial “stands tall, even as others try to knock us down,” he said. “It is built to outlast discrimination against the LGBT community. It is designed to demand inclusiveness.”

Palm Springs City Councilwoman Lisa Middleton, who was the first openly transgender person elected to non-judicial office in California, praised the gay veterans and the memorial that commemorates their service. She also alluded to the Trump Administration’s ban on transgender people joining the military and said there’s more work to be done.

“Any individual in their youth, who shares my personal history, who would walk into a recruiting station on monday and ask to enlist and wear their country’s uniform… would be turned down,” she said.

“Our patriotism is not defined by our gender and it is not defined by our sexual orientation,” she continued. “Our patriotism is defined by our devotion to our country and our devotion to our fellow citizens.”

1267,Man suspected in November ATM robbery dies soon after his release from jail on bail,"CLOSE ATM skimmers fit over existing card readers and take information from any person that swipes their card. USA Today Network

One of two men suspected in an armed robbery at a Palm Desert ATM died shortly after being released on bail in March, authorities said Friday.

Joshua Stratton, 37, of Desert Hot Springs was a suspect in the Nov. 12 afternoon robbery at an ATM in the 74-900 block of Country Club Drive, along with Marco Hernandez, 24, of Palm Desert.

The Riverside County Coroner's Office said Stratton died in the early morning of March 30, but officials were unable to release the cause of death because the investigation is still underway.

Detective Larry Gaines of the Desert Hot Springs police said drug paraphernalia was found at the scene of Stratton's death.

Jail records show Stratton was released after posting $35,000 bail on March 24.

Stratton and Hernandez — at least one of whom was wearing a Halloween-style werewolf mask — were suspected of robbing a person at gunpoint and fleeing with an undisclosed amount of money, according to sheriff's Investigator Armando Munoz, who said the victim was not hurt.

Authorities did not disclose what led them to identify Hernandez and Stratton as suspects, but said Hernandez was arrested on Nov. 13, when law enforcement served a search warrant at a home in the 77-700 block of Michigan Drive in Palm Desert.

Stratton was arrested Nov. 14 at a home in the 65-900 block of Cahuilla Drive in Desert Hot Springs, where investigators found ""evidence connected to the robbery,"" as well as ""an illegal assault rifle,"" Munoz said.

The rifle was not the firearm used in the ATM robbery.

Stratton's obituary on Legacy.com says ""He will be remembered for his energetic smile, crystal blue eyes and caring heart. Joshua always knew how to make those around him laugh.""

Hernandez is expected in court for a felony settlement conference on May 22, where a hearing also will convene to confirm Stratton's death certificate.

1282,"'It was a very violent night in our city': Four shootings, five people struck, two dead","FRESNO, California - Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer held a rare Sunday news conference after several violent crime plagued the city overnight.

""To say the least, it was a very violent night in our city,"" Dyer began. There were four shootings in less than a day: Five people were struck by bullets, and two people died.

Three of the shootings happened within 30 minutes of each other.

Dyer began first with detailing the last shooting of the night that resulted in two deaths, calling it ""tragic.""

At around 2:20 a.m., the department received a ShotSpotter alert with 26 rounds detected in the area of 855 W. Ashlan Ave., also known as The Parks at Fig Garden apartment complex.

Seventeen 911 calls came in.

Within two and a half minutes, officers were on scene and found a car submerged inside a canal. A woman was found on top of the car attempting to provide first aid on another woman.

A K-9 officer with a 50-foot leash rescued Nandy Williams by wrapping a leash around her waist and pulling her to safety.

When Fresno Fire Department arrived, firefighters retrieved two deceased shooting victims from the car: Kiara Austin, 19, and Brian Maxey, 20.

Austin is a mother of three children: Twin boys, 3, and a 7-month-old girl. Dyer says Maxey is the father of the baby.

The fourth person in the car, Geshon Maxey, seemingly escaped the scene and was found the McDonald's on Ashlan and West avenues, Dyer says. He had a gunshot wound to his arm, and was found with Mary Maxey, the fifth passenger, injured only from the crash.

""Our detectives are looking for leads at this time. And we are asking for the public to provide us those leads,"" Dyer pleads.

He calls the five victims innocent, saying they were not involved in criminal activity.

""They were simply parked in the apartment complex. They were there to visit with a friend and that's when they were approached by several African American males,"" Dyer explains.

The men asked why they were parked there, and told them to leave. As they prepared to leave, two suspects pulled out guns and started shooting at them as they drove away.

The driver was shot, lost control, drove through a wall and into the canal.

Police learned the suspects drove back around to the scene to check for any surviving passengers of the violent shooting. ""Fortunately, they did not locate them,"" the chief says.

A motive is unknown, Dyer says, but continues to urge the public to help with any information it may have.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Fresno Police Homicide Det. Victor Miranda at 559-621-2452 or Det. Miguel Alvarez at 559-260-7635 and/or Sgt. Andre Benson at 559-960-9459.

The three shootings that happened within 30 minutes of each other are detailed below:

8:36 p.m. 3800 block of North Recreation Avenue

The victim of the shooting is 26-year-old Cruz Garcia. He was recently released from prison two weeks ago.

He was struck by two bullets during a possible an interpersonal dispute. ""He is a gang member,"" Dyer says.

8:55 p.m. 5200 block of East Huntington Boulevard

Francisco Mancha, 30, reportedly a Bulldog gang member, went to his brother's home where Dyer says he became extremely drunk and started arguing with family members.

That's when he walked away, yelling and screaming. He comes across a Hispanic man on a bike, argues and the suspect pulls out a revolver and shoots him through his hand and into his shoulder.

""He is going to survive,"" Dyer says.

9:05 p.m. 400 block of South Dearing Avenue

A ShotSpotter alert notified officers of the shooting where a Hispanic man was shot while pulled over to lift off the top of his convertible.

Several gunshots rang out, three of them hitting the driver side of the car.

Anyone with information on either of these three shootings is asked to call Fresno Police Sgt. Todd Turney at 559-621-2420.

Compared to last year at this time, we are down in shootings. So far, there are 98, whereas last year there was 125.

1292,Students study Fat Man for national competition,"Two elementary school students are fashioning themselves as masters of the Manhattan Project, including making their way to China Lake Museum Friday afternoon to conduct their own research.

This is part of the National History Day national contest, in which students around the country conduct original research on topics of interest.

Fourth-graders Ethan Means and Peyton Rivera from Discovery Elementary School in Bakersfield, paid the China Lake Museum a visit to get a better understanding of how the Fat Man atomic bomb works.

“We wanted to learn more about Fat Man, the functions of it, and its local history in Kern County,” Means said.

“We learned a lot more than we expected,” Rivera said.

The duo won the Kern County competition with their report, “The Nation that Controlled the Sky: Tragic Devastation meets Triumphant Accomplishment,” complete with poster and comprehensive research that included trips to the National Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas in December and the Bradbury Science Museum in Los Alamos, New Mexico, over Spring Break.

1303,"After moving camp to Indio, Joseph Diaz Jr. is rejuvenated entering Canelo-Jacobs undercard bout","CLOSE The Olympic boxer from the Los Angeles suburb of South El Monte came to Indio where he says his career was reborn at the most crucial time Andrew L. John, The Desert Sun

Joseph Diaz Jr. didn’t initially want to be an Olympian. He first got into boxing as an 11-year-old to learn self-defense, then later dreamt of one day boxing in front of millions on HBO pay-per-view, being interviewed by renowned ringside commentator Max Kellerman and flinging a world championship belt over his shoulder.

Diaz never considered the Olympics until he sat down in his parents’ Los Angeles area home and weighed the pros and cons with those closest to him.

At 17, he was one of the top amateurs in the United States and desired to turn professional. But the 2012 London Olympics were two years away and USA Boxing had targeted Diaz as a candidate to represent the country. After the sit-down meeting, he opted to delay turning pro, and split a pair of bouts in London.

Being around the top athletes in the world, and the things he learned from them, he says, ended up being one of the most beneficial things for his professional career.

“I honestly feel like being in the Olympics made me the fighter that I am today,” said Diaz, who’s widely known by the nickname JoJo. “Just as far as my work ethic, as far as me being very, very disciplined, being motivated and grinding to the fullest and me pushing myself to the limits.”

The experience showed the southpaw (28-1, 14 knockouts) what it took to be elite. He’d watch athletes from every sport congregate with a singular focus, with no distractions, and he adopted a maniacal motivation and preparation that helped him to 26 consecutive wins to begin his pro career.

At some point, though, the drive and measured approach that once defined him became more difficult to summon as difficulties arose in his career. He lost his first bout to unbeaten world champion Gary Russell Jr. in May 2018, then he was unable to claim his first world title, despite beating champion Jesus Rojas, because he was four ounces over the sanctioned 126-pound weight limit.

So, toward the end of 2018, he and his team once again convened for another sit-down meeting to discuss inevitable changes he felt were needed. The decision was made to move his camp from the Los Angeles suburb of South El Monte out to the California desert to work with Joel and Antonio Diaz in Indio.

Following his first camp with both his dad and the Diaz brothers earlier this year, JoJo moved up to the 130-pound division and dominated Charles Huerta to win by unanimous decision at Fantasy Springs Resort Casino. And on May 4 in Las Vegas, on the undercard of the Canelo Alvarez-Daniel Jacobs championship bout, he’ll fight Freddy Fonseca for the chance to fling the World Boxing Association gold featherweight belt over his shoulder.

The opportunity to again fight for a title may not have immediately been possible, he says, if he hadn’t moved his camp out to the desert at the most crucial time of his professional career.

'I could've won that fight'

After the Gary Russell fight, Diaz knew he needed a change. It wasn’t just that he had lost for the first time in his pro career, but it was the belief that he could’ve won the fight if he had been better prepared in camp.

He maintains a year later that it wasn’t an ideal leadup to the biggest fight of his life.

“I felt like it was very unprofessional as far as my side, my team’s side, my coach’s side, my manager’s side, everything was all unprofessional,” he said. “It wasn’t like how it should’ve been as far as a meaningful title fight, where we had guys all lined up to come out, we had sparring lined up, we had a strict, day-to-day basis camp.”

Getting to the fight at MGM National Harbor, on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., added to the frustration of the camp. Diaz and his team missed their fight to Reagan National Airport and arrived two days before the weigh-in instead of four. He was still 6-7 pounds over the sanctioned weight and only finished shedding the weight minutes before the official stepping onto the scale, in front of thousands in attendance.

“It was like right before the weigh-in,” said Joseph Diaz Sr., JoJo’s dad. “That’s how crazy it was.”

Diaz said that despite just six weeks to prepare for the fight, the messy training schedule, the missed flight and struggle to make weight, he still felt ready entering the fight. But the outcome of the bout suggested otherwise.

He was not himself during the 12 rounds. He was too reserved, waiting for the perfect opening instead of keeping his hands loose and wearing Russell down, as Diaz is known to do to opponents.

“After that fight,” he said, “I still have no doubt, I was still 110 percent. I was still ready to go for that fight, I just didn’t perform the way I should’ve performed. I could’ve won that fight.”

Just three months later, though, Diaz was given another opportunity to fight for a world title. Though his body had growth and he was unsure if his body could get back to 126 pounds, he didn’t want to reject the opportunity. So, he took the fight, but this time he didn’t quite make the weight.

'Devastated'

Diaz arrived at the weigh-in to the championship bout in Los Angeles with Rojas six ounces over the sanctioned limit. He had done all he could, he said, to drop the weight, but his body couldn’t do any more.

He’s fought in the 126-pound division since he was 16, but over the last decade his body had grown and matured and getting to that weight for a fight had proved to be impossible for someone who had never missed weight for a bout in his pro career.

Hours before the weigh-in, instead of going to the sauna, Diaz tried an Epsom salt bath, which typically flushes 8-12 ounces of weight off. In this case, though, it made his already weak and dehydrated body become even more depleted.

“My muscles were just like spaghetti,” he recalls. “I tried to get up; I collapsed. It was really, really bad to the point that I couldn’t stand up. I was fainting. My dad was trying to wake me up. They carried me out of the bathroom, and I checked my weight and I was still a couple pounds overweight. I was devastated, man.”

Diaz went to the weigh-in at 126.6 points and was given an hour to shed the remaining six ounces. Most of the time, that’s easy for a boxer. But Diaz couldn’t get more than two ounces off.

“People didn’t realize how much I had already been through,” he said.

The bout was for the World Boxing Council title, streamed across the world, so he gave it another run. He went to the sauna, then to the steam room to shadow box for a few minutes, then back into the sauna. His body began to tingle. He started screaming for his dad and members of his team pulled him out.

Diaz returned to the official scale at 126.4, and Rojas only agreed to fight him if Diaz gave him half of his purse and if it wasn’t for the world title.

“I took it, dude,” Diaz said. “I took the L. I took the L of not winning the world title and I took the L by the 50 percent of my purse I lost.”

He won the bout but said that he again felt unprofessional about the process and knew that something needed to change for his career to continue.

'Extra motivation'

Diaz and his team sat down again last September and decided to reach out to the Diaz brothers about relocating his camp to the desert. The sit-down is a process Diaz has used to make big decisions in his life, going back to when he came to the excruciatingly difficult resolution as a freshman in high school to give up a promising baseball career in order to pursue boxing more intensely.

Indio seemed to be the perfect place. It was close enough to home that he could easily get back if he needed to, but secluded and quiet enough for him to block out any distractions and refocus.

The Diaz brothers also had other professionals with world championship experience, such as Francisco Vargas, and others with title aspirations — Diego De La Hoya and a hoard of European boxers among them. Being around others of that caliber was appealing to Diaz.

“The environment really helps a boxer,” said unbeaten welterweight Vergil Ortiz Jr., who will fight in the May 4 co-main event in Las Vegas. “There’s nothing in Indio. You’re in a house full of other boxers, especially in that camp, a lot of other Golden Boy boxers who are going to do big things, and when you surround yourself with people like that you become one of those people.

“You’re going to have competition and you’re going to want to be the best. When you’re at home, yeah, you do get distracted a lot. You have more friends, (they) want to go do more stuff, want to go out. But when you’re away from home, it’s easier to keep your mind focused.”

Antonio Diaz added that boxers appreciate the quiet, relaxing atmosphere of the Coachella Valley, and that in the desert they can block out all distractions.

“You’re there to concentrate and train hard,” Antonio Diaz said. “That’s what you’re there for. You’re not there for having fun, to visit friends or girlfriends. You’re there to work, and that’s what JoJo has been doing here.”

JoJo Diaz arrived in Indio toward the end of last year and opted to fight at 130 pounds. He said it was a great decision, as he was able to make the weight without issues and that relieved much of the stress he had encountered entering his two previous fights.

He dominated Charles Huerta in 12 rounds at Fantasy Springs Resort Casino on Feb. 9 and began preparing for another title shot, this time at 130 pounds.

“I’m comfortable,” he said. “I’m not stressed about making the weight anymore. I’m not second guessing myself.”

Part of that, he said, is the training environment. He said that each day when he goes to the gym, he’s competing with the accomplished boxers he’s around. They share tips and tricks with each other and support one another, but they also compete with each other and push each other to be the best.

Diaz said the atmosphere is similar to when he was in London, when he marveled at how dedicated and focused each Olympic athlete was to being the best. And he said it’s rejuvenated him.

“I’ve always been self-motivated,” Diaz said. “I’ve always been self-dedicated and always push the limits of myself. But I felt like I needed that extra motivation to actually go out and be isolated inside a camp and inside a gym, where there’s nothing but professionals there — people who have the same goals and vision as me who want to be world champion, just like me.”

He runs four to five miles in the mornings. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays he does sprint intervals and strength training to work on his endurance. Then he hits the gym for boxing specific training in the afternoons and heads to 24 Hour Fitness at night for low-impact cardio training.

With Joel and Antonio Diaz, he’s learned to cut the distance on his punches, which allows him to get the full arm extension and more power. They are also introducing him to training methods that’ll help him get into the best shape of his life.

“The thing is, he knows boxing, he’s a professional, but there’s things that he can still learn,” said Antonio Diaz, a former world champion. “Anybody can still learn from anybody. His last fight, he showed that.”

'Sink or swim'

When he isn’t training, Diaz says he goes to bowling or to the movies. Not that he has a lot of time. Most days he’s so exhausted that he goes home to his place in Indio and his dad cooks a small meal for him.

He’s kept a low profile the last two months he’s been in the desert and said he can’t wait to show the world how he’s prepared for his May 4 bout.

“I feel really, really good in there. I’m able to showcase everybody my skills because this time my body isn’t depleted. I’m able to show them my slickness, my speed, my power, everything.”

The plan is for Diaz to take a couple months off after this bout, then return to Indio in the late summer for a potential unification bout with featherweight champion Tevin Framer later this year.

For now, that’s just talk. Diaz understands that he needs to win Saturday for that to happen.

“I’m at the point in my career where it’s sink or swim,” he said. “I’m fighting the really elite fighters, I’m fighting fights that are really meaningful and I’ve got to shine and I’ve really got to showcase to everybody that I’m the real deal.

“Last year was difficult, but I came out here and I’m very confident in the work that I’ve put in, knowing what I needed to do, so that when it comes fight night there’s no worries. I’ve now just got to go in there, enjoy myself and do what I do best.”

1312,Lynyrd Skynyrd at Stagecoach: 3 things you need to know about the set,"CLOSE Stagecoach Festival takes place April 26-28 at Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif. Wochit, Wochit

This wasn't the first time Lynyrd Skynyrd played Stagecoach country music festival in Indio, Calif., but this time, the excitement was palpable Saturday, the second day of the 2019 event. The legendary band is in the midst of its farewell tour, and fans in Skynyrd t-shirts filled the Palomino tent well before the 7:40 p.m. set launched. So, how was it? Well, let's get to the main question first.

Buy Photo Lynyrd Skynyrd performs on the Palomino Stage at Stagecoach Festival in Indio, Calif. on Saturday, April 27, 2019. (Photo: Vickie Connor/The Desert Sun)

Free as a bird

Skynyrd seemed to wrap the set with a rousing ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" and the rowdy crowd sang every word. The band left the stage, and the way-over-capacity crowd started to thin. But then an illuminated bird with an American flag in its beak appeared on the screen behind the stage. Could it be? Yes. ""Free Bird."" Nary a dry eye in the house as the band ended its encore listing all past and present band and crew members. It was quite a list; the band has a tragic history.

No street fightin' man

Toward the end of the set, Skynyrd broke out the banger ""Gimme Three Steps"" and contrary to every single story I've heard someone tell about going to a Skynyrd concert, the inevitable fight didn't break out. If it had, there would have been no three steps to give or take, as the Palomino tent was near double capacity, spilling out onto the field on a warm and windy night.

Southern rock heaven

Toward the middle of the set, the strains of the winsome ""Tuesday's Gone"" had the crowd screaming and swaying. When they followed up with ""Don't Ask Me No Questions,"" the energy really picked up. But as the opening notes of ""Simple Man"" wafted from the stage, a cowboy in the crowd cried out, ""Is this my funeral?"" I'm sure many in the crowd felt the same way.

1314,President Trump offers sympathies after synagogue shooting,"POWAY (AP) - President Donald Trump has offered ""deepest sympathies to the families of those affected"" by a shooting at a synagogue outside San Diego.

At the White House, Trump said Saturday that the shooting ""looked like a hate crime"" and called it ""hard to believe.""

He spoke from the South Lawn before flying to a rally in Wisconsin. Authorities say a 19-year-old man opened fire on Chabad of Poway on the last day of Passover, killing one woman and wounding three others, including a girl.

They say he reported the shooting and surrendered without incident after an officer pulled him over.

San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said at a news conference that he had no details on motive. Authorities say they were reviewing copies of his social media posts.

A 39-year-old man was jailed Friday morning on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer in Palm Springs, authorities said.

Officers responded about 8:50 p.m. Thursday to a report of a disturbance in a vehicle at an apartment complex in the 500 block of Rosa Parks Road. There, they approached a man in the driver seat of a vehicle, according to a statement from the Palm Springs Police Department.

As they neared the car, the man, identified as Roberto Mendoza, threatened the officers while holding a knife. Police said he then put the vehicle in reverse and tried to strike the officers with the vehicle.

Police surrounded Mendoza's vehicle and prevented him from escaping.

He was booked into the Smith Correctional Facility in Banning.

No injuries were reported.

1323,"Suspect in 3-hour pursuit was 'ex-felon on post release community supervision,' police say","- A 29-year-old Buena Park man was in custody Thursday after leading law enforcement officers on a three-hour chase through Los Angeles and Orange counties before he pulled into a shopping center and ran into a 99 Cents Only store, where he was arrested at gunpoint.

Alexis Avinai was booked on suspicion of domestic violence and felony evading, according to the South Gate Police Department. He was held on $125,000 bail.

Police said Avinai is an ""ex-felon on post release community supervision.''

According to police, Avinai was accompanied in the car by his girlfriend, who was treated for unspecified injuries and taken to a hospital in stable condition. Her name was not released.

The chase began about 5:15 p.m. Wednesday near Firestone Boulevard and California Avenue in South Gate.

Police were informed of a dispute between a man and a woman in the car and the driver took off when an officer spotted and approached the vehicle, South Gate Police Capt. Darren Arakawa told reporters.

During the chase the woman was seen struggling with the man, and a few times opened the passenger-side door, but did not get out as the car kept moving.

The suspect drove on streets and freeways, running red lights and at times taking to the wrong side of the street, narrowly missing other vehicles and pedestrians. He drove into Orange County before heading back to Los Angeles County. At one point, he drove through a park and plowed through a fence.

South Gate police chased the car for a time before the California Highway Patrol took the lead.

It appeared an officer in a CHP cruiser was moving into position to attempt a PIT maneuver and at one point the patrol car made contact with the rear of the Honda, but the suspect drove on.

About three hours after the chase began, the suspect pulled into a parking space and ran into a 99 Cents Only store near the intersection of Nogales Street and Colima Road in Rowland Heights, prompting people to stream out of the business.

Officers ran into the store with rifles drawn and soon after the suspect was led out in handcuffs.

1334,"As manhunt ends, police now investigating whether three Bay Area homicides linked: source","- Police are now investigating whether three homicides committed in three cities in in about four hours are now linked, a source told KTVU on Saturday.

The revelation came after a manhunt concluded late Friday night when 43-year-old Stefon Jefferson was taken into custody in Douglass County, Nevada, according to San Francisco police.

Jefferson was spotted in South Lake Tahoe and then was apprehended after a high-speed chase when he crossed county lines by members of the Douglas County Sheriff's Department in Nevada about 11 p.m.

According to the Fox Reno station, the high-speed chase led to shots being fired and a sergeant was shot in the hand.

Homicide suspect Stefon Jefferson was apprehended this evening in Douglas County, NV and is in custody. https://t.co/tpc86bWPtd — San Francisco Police (@SFPD) April 27, 2019

San Francisco and Oakland police had been searching for Jefferson, who was considered armed and dangerous, after a pair of fatal shootings Friday spanning both sides of the Bay.

Jefferson is suspected of killing Marcus Jackson at 41st and Market streets, about five-blocks northwest of the MacArthur BART Station in Oakland at around 10:15 a.m. Oakland police said they arrived to the scene to find Jackson suffering from multiple bullet wounds. Jackson died at the scene. Neighbors said Jackson was an employee of the city of Berkeley. ""His personality...he was just awesome. He'll be missed said one neighbor, who did not want to be identified on camera.

Jefferson is also suspected of killing 49-year-old Laron Davis of San Francisco Friday around 1:30 p.m. in San Francisco's Bayview District, police and the San Francisco Medical Examiner said.

Officers were dispatched to the Alice Griffith public housing complex on the 2600 block of Arelious Walker Drive on a call of a shooting. Witnesses said they reported hearing a pop and saw a man on the ground. Davis died later at the hospital.

Finally, at 2:40 p.m. a man was also shot in the head Friday afternoon at Berkeley's People Park. The Alameda County Coroner did not identify him on Saturday. But a source told KTVU that the University of California at Berkeley police are now investigating whether this death at 2556 Haste Street is related to the other two.

1337,Sheriff: Man 'thrashed sword around in the middle of Dersch Road',"Timothy Sedmak (Photo: Shasta County Sheriff's Office)

Shasta County sheriff's deputies say a man pulled out a 3-foot sword after they tried to contact him about camping illegally in a remote area near Shingletown Friday.

Officials say someone reported Timothy Sedmak, 63, illegally camping on the 25000 block of Dersch Road Friday morning.

When deputies got there around 11:30 a.m., they said one of them tried to talk to Sedmak, who was in his travel trailer. The man ""became uncooperative and was yelling at the deputy to leave him alone,"" deputies said.

Deputies found out Sedmak had a ""potential for violence"" and is part of the sovereign citizens movement, they said. The movement is characterized by a defiance of perceived government overreach.

At that point, the deputies said they moved further down Dersch Road and saw Sedmak come out of the trailer with a sword about 3 feet long.

""Sedmak thrashed the sword around in the middle of Dersch Road and was motioning for the deputy to come to him,"" a press release from the sheriff's office reads.

More deputies showed up, and Sedmak kept going in and out of his trailer, they said. The deputies closed Dersch for safety reasons and started negotiating with Sedmak, whom they said eventually came out again without the sword and talked.

Sedmak was eventually arrested on suspicion of brandishing a weapon and resisting arrest. They said it was the third time in four months that Sedmak has been arrested on suspicion of the latter charge.

1338,Valley man shares his killer art,"William Harder's home is filled with photographs of men and women he calls friends. But to others, they are iconic figures in dark parts of American history.

His story starts 18 years ago when he came across Richard Ramirez's artwork online. Ramirez is otherwise known as the ""night stalker."" He was a convicted serial killer who raped and tortured more than a dozen people in California.

""I then decided to find Richard Ramirez's address on death row in California. It took a while and I found it and wrote him a letter and sure enough, he wrote back.""

They struck up a friendship and that's when Harder started to become a regular visitor at San Quentin State Prison.

""It was like looking at a venomous snake in a way and it was really neat when you think about what he had done, the actions he had committed to get him in prison. This is someone who tortured people recreationally.""

Harder then started his mission to reach out to the other inmates, including the infamous Charles Manson.

""Sometimes it is hard to hold back excitement when you are meeting someone like Manson. It's exciting. I took more from my visits with Charles Manson than any other inmate I met.""

Harder also became close to convicted serial killer Dorothea Puente. She ran a boarding house in Sacramento and murdered her elderly boarders before cashing their Social Security checks.

Harder says he sat with her for hours a day while she was in hospice care before she passed. Now he has her with him in his home.

""She was Catholic so I picked out an urn for her. I am not a theistic person, but I would like to think of her as watching over me.""

After 18 years of this journey, he has visited prisons in four different states, three different death rows, and more than 90 convicted murderers.

His house has become a makeshift ""murderabilia"" museum. Almost every cabinet and wall is lined with the artwork created by inmates.

""The thing I have found I love the most is inmate true crime related memorabilia. It is not something you can buy at Walmart.""

To share his passion of inmate art with others, he created the website murderauction.com where you can list buy or bid on items from inmates.

Harder says none of the inmates receive any of the profits, but it doesn't stop victims' advocates and families fighting against him. He adds that the main reason he got into this was to help people.

""I try to be, as silly as this sounds, a little ray of sunshine. Prison sucks and you get abandoned by your family.""

He wants to provide peace for these convicted killers in the last years of their lives.

The two officers died in the line of duty on Saturday. (October 9, 2016) Richard Lui/The Desert Sun

A 39-year-old man was jailed Friday morning on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer in Palm Springs, authorities said.

Officers responded about 8:50 p.m. Thursday to a report of a disturbance in a vehicle at an apartment complex in the 500 block of Rosa Parks Road. There, they approached a man in the driver seat of a vehicle, according to a statement from the Palm Springs Police Department.

As they neared the car, the man, identified as Roberto Mendoza, threatened the officers while holding a knife. Police said he then put the vehicle in reverse and tried to strike the officers with the vehicle.

Police surrounded Mendoza's vehicle and prevented him from escaping.

1363,Four things you can't miss inside Stagecoach 2019 campgrounds,"There’s nothing quite like the campgrounds at Stagecoach, and the 2019 festival doesn't disappoint.

Whether it’s an alcohol-dispensing pink flamingo mounted to bicycle handlebars or a beer-chugging party nearly a dozen tables long, the real party happens outside the festival grounds.

While the campgrounds were a beer fest Friday, campers hanging out on Saturday chilled to Willie Nelson tunes and hung out in inflatable pools to cool off in the blazing heat.

For fans checking out the campgrounds Saturday afternoon or Sunday, here are four things you're bound to come across.

Beer, beer and more beer

Many campers love to drink, and they showed it off Saturday with a few hand-made contraptions.

While most drank underneath canopies, a few new trends emerged Saturday. On several camping rows, people pooled together their folding tables about a dozen long to play their favorite drinking games.

Waving flags

No, Stagecoach is not Glastonbury, but it’s a close second. For every beer party, there's an RV with flags mounted on the roof.

Yes, there's Confederate flags mixed with ""Don't Tread On Me.""

But Stagecoach campers also have unique taste, as evidenced by the flags showcasing the Los Angeles Rams, Jack Daniel's, Capital Records and ""Dilly Dilly,"" the popular Bud Light refrain.

Cops

Unlike at Coachella, Stagecoach campgrounds have a heavy police presence.

Officers in patrol cars and SUVs routinely drove up and down each of the rows while keeping an eye on the parties.

So if you're trying to do anything foolish, it's probably going to be hard to get away with it.

Cowboy bird

One of the oddest things found in the campgrounds was a stuffed bird dressed as a cowboy with a hat football and on its head. Its owner tucked him inside a white picket fence and left him out for the world to see.

SAN DIEGO (CNN) - A man was in custody after a shooting at a synagogue in the California city of Poway left at least one person dead and several others wounded, Mayor Steve Vaus said Saturday.

The shooting, which Vaus described as a possible hate crime, occurred at Congregation Chabad on the last day of Passover.

The Palomar Medical Center Poway received four patients from the shooting, according to a hospital spokeswoman.

Vaus said the three people who were wounded have non-life-threatening injuries.

He said he considered it a hate crime ""because of statements that were made when the shooter entered.""

The mayor said the congregation was targeted by ""someone with hate in their heart ... towards our Jewish community and that just will not stand."" The congregaton ""took security very seriously,"" he said.

""I also understand from folks on the scene that this shooter was engaged by people in the congregation and those brave people certainly prevented this from being a much worse tragedy,"" Vaus told CNN.

Congregation member Minoo Anvari, who said her husband witnessed the shooting, said the rabbi called for unity and prayed for peace even after getting shot.

""Rabbi said, 'We are united,'"" said Anvari, a refugee from Iran.

""This is something bad (that) is happening all over. And we have to believe that this bad thing is real and we don't have to ignore it. We have to open our eyes. He prayed for peace. I respect him -- even in spite of being injured he refused to go to hospital and he spoke. And he finished his speech and he then left the synagogue.""

Anvari said her husband told her the shooter was screaming and cursing when he opened fire.

A witness told CNN affiliate KGTV there were six or seven shots followed by screams and then another volley of shots. The witness said the wounded rabbi tried to calm the gunman and members of the congregation.

The San Diego Police Department is assisting sheriff's deputies with the incident, according to a tweet from Chief David Nisleit.

""No known threats however in an abundance of caution, we will be providing extra patrol at places of worship,"" Nisleit said.

Deputies were called to the synagogue about 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET). The synagogue's Facebook page said a Passover celebration was scheduled for 11 a.m.

Passover, one of the holiest Jewish celebrations of the year, ends Saturday.

The incident comes months six months to the day after the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.

On October 27, Robert Bowers stormed the synagogue, killing 11 people in what the Anti-Defamation League said was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in US history.A federal law enforcement official said at the time that Bowers made anti-Semitic statements during the shooting and targeted Jews on social media.

The Chabad of Poway website said the congregation is a center for Jewish people of all backgrounds. It was established in 1986.

Poway, about 20 miles north of San Diego, has about 48,000 residents. It is an upper-middle-class community that calls itself ""The City in the Country."" The city website said it has one of the lowest crime rates in the state.

An $18,000 fountain sculpture was stolen from a Palm Desert luxury spa for people and pets on Easter, according to its owner.

Lindi Biggi, who owns the spa Venus de Fido, said the sculpture was stolen between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. The sculpture, which was bolted to the ground and weighed at least 70 pounds, was stolen by a man who fled with it on a bicycle.

""It’s irreplaceable,"" she said, adding there are only about 25 of the sculptures in the world.

Biggi said she will give $1,000 to anyone who returns the undamaged sculpture to her.

""It’s the prettiest piece in town,"" she said.

It's not the first time vandals have stolen from Biggi's business.

Thieves have previously nabbed a golf cart, dog statue, 9-foot skeleton, car radios and generators, she said.

Biggi filed a report with the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. Based on surveillance footage, she said the man who stole the sculpture may have also stolen the skeleton.

And that's exactly what he did Sunday night in the Palomino tent.

""They say Tom Jones isn't country,"" he said to the crowd. ""Well I'm not from the city, I can tell you that.""

Here are five takeaways from Jones' impressive hour-and-10-minute set at Stagecoach on Sunday.

Good stories

A lot of today's country stars have music stories that start out like, ""Well, when I finished second on 'The Voice,' I got to work with Blake Shelton.""

Tom Jones' stories are a little different.

Like the one he told about when he and Elvis were often playing on the same nights in Vegas and when each of their shows were over, they would go back to the hotel room and just sing gospel songs together.

Lame. Was Jones or Elvis ever even on a reality show?

Buy Photo Tom Jones performs at the Stagecoach country music festival, Indio, Calif., April 28, 2019. (Photo: Zoë Meyers/The Desert Sun)

Gospel heavy

Speaking of gospel, like the song ""God's Gonna Cut You Down,"" which he and Elvis played together, most of the first half of Jones' set Sunday was gospel music.

He came out in a black suit, the coat with thick green pin stripes, and he took the crowd to church, starting with ""Burning Hell"" and ""Did Trouble Me."" Gospel has been a staple of Jones' recent music, but it was still interesting to see how gospel-heavy his set really was. It was nice.

The hits finally came

His set hit a crossover point in the middle when he started sing his subtly titled ""Sex Bomb"" in a slow gospel style, before the band kicked in and flipped the switch to rock 'n' roll. The crowd went nuts when the song was over.

All night, Jones had a consistently loud, clear and powerful voice and an accompanying band to match.

He also played crowd favorites ""Delilah,"" ""It's Not Unusual"" and, the one that had the most oomph behind it, ""You Can Leave Your Hat On."" Sorry ""What's New Pussycat"" fans, it didn't happen.

Princely finish

One of his closing numbers was the song that's really been one of his biggest hits of the last two decades, and that's his cover of Prince's song ""Kiss.""

I was eager to see if he would go Prince-level crazy on that one ""Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with"" moment, but he played it cool instead. There was also some great brass moments during the song. A crowd-pleaser.

Final verdict: impressed

Jones said this was his second time at Stagecoach. He also came to see his friend Jerry Lee Lewis two years ago. Unlike Jerry Lee, who needed help getting on and off the stage, Jones is still uber-vibrant. This was not a fun stroll down memory lane, this was an impressive vocal performance by a man who feels like he still has several good years left in him.

1385,Top Property: Walther Way in Brentwood,"- Grab your suit! We’re heading to 694 Walther Way in Brentwood where it’s hard to resist the zero edge waterfall pool in the resort-like backyard that also includes a sport court and cabana.

The new construction 9,000 sq. ft. warm, contemporary home was designed and developed by Ramtin Ray Nosrati of Hungtington Estate Properties, who provides Marla Tellez with the Top Property tour.

From the rooftop deck, where you can see both the ocean and the Getty, to the underground 3,000 sq. ft. “man cave,” the home is four stories.

It has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and embraces an open floor plan and indoor-outdoor lifestyle throughout. Other amenities include a screening room, built-in bar, eco-smart fireplaces, and celebrity artwork. On the day we visited, Realism Pop Artist, Tiffanie Anderson, was finishing her life-size tribute pieces to late rapper, Nipsey Hussle.

At the end of the tour, things got a little competitive between Marla and Nosrati on that sport court. A basketball shootout ends with loser jumping in the pool. Somehow, they both ended up underwater and report back, “the pool works.”



As for the asking price for Nosrati’s latest splash hit: $14,900,000.

1386,Kings County Sheriff's Office releases details leading up to fatal deputy-involved shooting,"Related headlines: Suspect shot and killed by Kings County deputy after chase

KINGS COUNTY, California - The Kings County Sheriff's Office released details that led up to the fatal deputy-involved shooting of a 23-year-old man Thursday night, who they say was on a multi-day crime spree.

Around 10 p.m., a deputy observed a vehicle in the area of 19th Avenue and Highway 198 that matched the description of a vehicle connected to a Fresno County Sheriff's Office case.

A deputy tried to stop the suspect, now identified as Blayne Erwin Morris, 23, but he wouldn't pull over. Along with the Kings County Sheriff's Office, the Lemoore Police Department, the Avenal Police Department, and the California Highway Patrol ground and air units chased the vehicle.

The chase ended in the area west of Gale Avenue and Avenal Cutoff Road where he was found about an hour later laying in a field. As a deputy approached him once caught by a K-9 officer, he rolled over, aimed a gun at a deputy and was shot once.

""The weapon possessed by the suspect was a large caliber handgun loaded with 6 bullets with the cocking mechanism cocked to the full open position ready to be fired,"" described the sheriff's office.

EMS arrived on scene and pronounced him dead. Four deputies involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave, the sheriff's office confirms.

Deputies say Morris had been on a multi-day crime spree around Fresno and San Benito counties. He allegedly stole at least two trucks, a trailer and several pieces of farm and ag equipment.

He also stole a rifle, according to deputies, and used it to shoot a property owner who had tried to stop him in the middle of one of his thefts in San Benito.

Several law enforcement agencies are investigating the crimes and incident.

LOS ANGELES (CNN) - The man who was wounded -- and later jailed -- in a shooting that took the life of rapper Nipsey Hussle has broken his silence.

According to CNN affiliate KCAL, Kerry Lathan, 56, is seeking housing after being one of two men wounded in a shooting during which the 33-year-old musical artist, activist and entrepreneur was killed.

On Wednesday, Lathan appeared at a news conference in Los Angeles in a wheelchair.

He said he was at Hussle's The Marathon Clothing store in Los Angeles to pick up an item of clothing when bullets flew in the parking lot next to the shop.

""[Hussle] told me that he would have the shirt that I needed next week and I said okay,"" Lathan said. ""And as I turned it was all bad.""

He gave an update on his condition since the shooting.

""I have a bullet in my back. Fragment in it broke off near my spine,"" Lathan said. ""They say if we take it out, there's a possibility you could be paralyzed.""

He also discussed being arrested days after the shooting.

Lathan had been released on parole seven months ago after serving about 25 years for murder. He was arrested and accused of violating his parole by associating with a gang member because Hussle was a member of the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips.

Police said Lathan's phone contained photos of him posing with men throwing the Rollin 60s gang sign.

Lathan said during the press conference that he ""didn't have no idea of any of that.""

""I know they said [Hussle] was a Rolling 60s. That's not what he is today,"" Lathan said. ""He's a celebrity. I took a picture with a celebrity. I met him once, took a selfie.""

After reviewing the incident, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation determined it was merely a ""technical violation,"" requested the petition be dismissed and Lathan was released 12 days after his arrest.

Eric Holder has been arrested as the alleged shooter and is charged with murder, two counts of attempted murder and possession of a firearm by a felon.

He is being held on $5 million bail and is scheduled to be back in court May 10.

1392,Blood match helps Tulare County detectives catch suspected assailant,"CLOSE Elizabeth Holmes, the CEO of a company promising revolutionary blood testing by taking just a finger prick for multiple blood tests, was charged with fraud. USA TODAY

A Valley man accused of assaulting a woman left behind a specific clue that ultimately led to his capture — blood.

After a five-month investigation, Tulare County detectives say a positive blood match helped them land their man.

At 3:42 a.m. on Dec. 2, deputies were called to the Ducor Handy Market at Avenue 56 and Highway 65.

A woman had been attacked.

When deputies arrived, they spoke to the woman. She was crying. She said someone driving a pickup truck rammed into her car several times while she was on her way to Porterville from Delano.

The woman lost control of her car. While she was stopped, a man got out of the truck and tried to get into her car through the driver's side door, she told deputies.

At one point, he used a hammer to smash the window and ended up cutting himself. The woman sped away before the suspect could reach her, deputies said.

The suspect left blood on the car. It was later tested by the Department of Justice.

A match recently came back.

On Thursday, Tulare County detectives and Delano police served a search warrant at a home in the 1110 block of Freemont Street in Delano.

Evidence found at the home led detectives to a second home in the 800 block of Maria Way. Silvestre Zavala Pimentel was living at the home.

Detectives searched the home and interviewed the 40-year-old Delano man. Pimentel was later arrested in connection to the assault.

Detectives didn't say what evidence, other than the blood sample, linked Pimentel to the December incident or what the motive was.

He was booked into Tulare County Pretrial Facility on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. His bail was set at $50,000.

Anyone with information about this case is urged to call Detective Scott O’Neill at 1-800-808-0488 or anonymously at tcso@tipnow.com or by text or voicemail at 725-4194.

1395,"22-year-old man crashes into dark field, his body was found the next morning by a driver","TULARE, California - Authorities with the Tulare Police Department are piecing together what lead up to a fatal, rollover crash Tuesday night.

At around midnight, neighbors in the area of Laspina Street and Paige Avenue heard tires screeching, but no one saw what happened, according to police.

At 6 a.m., officers found the crash site and learned a 22-year-old man was ejected from the car and was dead for at least 2 hours.

The man's car was found in a dark field, making it hard to be seen by passing cars. Police say the person who reported the crash after seeing the scene on his way to work.

Police believe speed is a factor in the crash, and the driver may have lost control and hit the center median.

The victim has not been identified.

1414,Jessie James Decker covers Led Zeppelin and Shania Twain at Stagecoach with husband Eric Decker looking on,"CLOSE Stagecoach Festival takes place April 26-28 at Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif. Wochit, Wochit

Jessie James Decker admitted to her fans it was toasty at Stagecoach Festival 2019.

""It is hot as balls out here,"" she said Saturday in a black bikini top and skirt a few songs into her 20-minute set.

Decker, a singer-songwriter, author and entrepreneur, took full advantage of her set by covering Led Zeppelin's ""What Is And What Should Never Be"" and Shania Twain's ""Man! I Feel Like A Woman.""

Though it was her first time at Stagecoach, Decker drew several thousand fans as the first act on the Mane Stage. She's built her brand in recent years by founding Kittenish, which makes women's clothing, and having 3 million people follow her on Instagram.

She's also married to former former NFL wide receiver Eric Decker, who caught touchdown passes from former Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning. Her husband watched her set from the side of the stage.

Decker's set began about 10 minutes late due to unknown issues. During some of the songs, fans in the standing area heard a mix that sounded like Decker's voice was muddied. It seemed the speakers in the first and second corrals were slightly out of phase.

But throughout her abbreviated set, fans danced and hollered every time Decker finished a song.

In addition to covering some rock and country classics, Decker also performed ""I Look So Good (Without You)"" and ""Roots and Wings.""

A few minutes before leaving, Decker complimented her fans who had braved the sun to see her perform.

""You look good sweaty,"" she said.

Desert Hot Springs police have arrested a 53-year-old woman on suspicion of driving intoxicated by drugs and gross vehicular manslaughter in a crash that killed a 76-year-old man crossing the street Thursday evening.

A city news release said the crash at Mission Lakes Boulevard and West Drive occurred just after 6:30 p.m. Thursday.

Police said Rebecca Goehner, of Desert Hot Springs, was heading west on Mission Lakes Boulevard in her 2002 Ford Mustang, but failed to stop at a four-way stop and struck the victim, who has not been identified, who was in a crosswalk.

Officials said the man died at the scene.

Goehner was booked into the Smith Correctional Facility in Banning with bail set at $90,000.

During the altercation Goehner assaulted the registered owner of the car, who was present at the scene.

The Desert Hot Springs major accident investigation team said anyone with information about the collision can call (760) 329-6411, Ext 375 or 372.

The collision closed both roads for several hours on Thursday night.

1419,Palm Springs homicide suspect's arraignment in death of 75-year-old woman on hold,"CLOSE 2018 had the lowest homicide rate in this decade for the Coachella Valley. Palm Springs Desert Sun

The arraignment for a man accused of killing a 75-year-old Palm Springs woman was delayed again on Friday, court officials said.

Stephen McKernan, 76, was scheduled to appear on Thursday in Riverside County Superior Court at Larson Justice Center in Indio. It was to be his first public appearance since his arrest Monday night on suspicion of killing Clarie Carsman.

But Thursday, court officials said McKernan ""was not cleared"" by the county jail to appear in court. Again Friday, a court official said McKernan ""was not cleared"" to appear.

Officers found Carsman's body about 6 p.m. Monday at a home in the 300 block of Pico Road, according to Palm Springs police.

She had suffered ""significant trauma,"" investigators said.

Sgt. Mike Casavan confirmed it was McKernan who notified police. Police later identified him as a suspect in Carsman's death.

Police described McKernan as a house guest who had known the victim and her husband for several years. But the victim's friend, who said she also was her former caretaker, told KESQ that there was no indication Carsman and McKernan knew each other.

As of Thursday, McKernan remained at the Southwest Detention Center in Murrieta with bail set at $1 million.

There was no sign of police activity outside the Pico Road home this week and several neighbors told The Desert Sun they knew little about its occupants.

1428,"Stagecoach 2019: Hey y'all, here are the 30 moments that made it special","My shoes are dusty. My belly has a nice thick barbecue lining. And I'm saying y'all a lot.

It must be the days right after Stagecoach. Another fun year at the desert's country music festival is in the books. Here are my 30 takeaways from this year's event.

1. Top moment was easy: Sunday night Jason Aldean said to the Route 91 concert survivors who were in the crowd, ""The last time we were together this song got cut off,"" and then he played ""When She Says Baby."" That was the song he was playing when the Vegas shooting happened. Sunday's completed version was a chilling, emotional moment.

More: At Stagecoach, Jason Aldean finishes song he couldn't complete at Route 91 festival

2. It finally happened: The much-rumored arrival of Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus to sing mega-hit ""Old Town Road"" didn't occur until the final minutes of the fest during Diplo's electronic night set on Sunday. Those who stayed were rewarded.

More: Lil Nas X, Billy Ray Cyrus perform 'Old Town Road' during Diplo's Stagecoach after-party

3. Luke Bryan, who also headlined in 2014 and 2016, did so again on Friday. It was a busy weekend for him as he left the desert immediately and played a full concert in Nashville on Saturday.

4. Lynyrd Skynyrd definitely had the fullest Palomino Stage set this week. It was bursting at the seams and had so many singalong moments, it was a thrill for fans. The sound of the crowd singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is still ringing around the polo grounds.

More: Our favorite Stagecoach moments: Lynyrd Skynyrd, 'Redneck Sundaes' and beer squirt guns

5. Bret Michaels said being at Stagecoach Friday was one of the best days of his life. Sounds like hyperbole, but I kinda believed him. He was loving it up there during his set.

More: Bret Michaels review: The five major moments from former Poison front man's set

6. Tom Jones still has it. The 78-year-old Welsh sex symbol put forth an impressive vocal set mixing gospel music, current covers and some of his hits to a delighted crowd. No one threw any undergarments on stage, but there were visuals on the big screen of some being waved around by the crowd.

More: Tom Jones channels Elvis, Prince during Stagecoach set. Which is to say, he's still got it

7. The most photographed act at Stagecoach this weekend? That's an easy one: Guy Fieri cooking demonstrations.

Buy Photo Guy Fieri takes Bret Michaels to flavortown at Guy's Stagecoach Smokehouse at Stagecoach country music festival in Indio, Calif., on April 26, 2019. (Photo: Shad Powers/The Desert Sun)

8. Reality competitors galore at this year's Stagecoach as American Idol winner Scott McCreery played on Friday, while the runner-up to McCreery, Lauren Alaina, played on Sunday. Voice champion Danielle Bradberry also performed Sunday.

9. I know this isn't an original take, but every time I see him or hear him, I just can't get over how much Scotty McCreery's voice doesn't match his look. Deep voice for a lanky, baby-faced dude. Gets me every time.

10. Sam Hunt motored through a competent headlining set on Saturday and he also re-emerged late Sunday night to sing his hit ""Body Like a Back Road"" during Diplo's performance.

Buy Photo Sam Hunt performs at the Stagecoach country music festival, Indio, Calif., April 27, 2019. (Photo: Zoë Meyers/The Desert Sun)

More: Sam Hunt brings strong voice and guitarist to Stagecoach, but where was Lil Nas X?

11. I'll be honest, when I first heard ""Body Like a Back Road"" I didn't get it. Dusty? Pot hole-filled? Crowned so rain falls off it? But then I finally figured it out: Curvy.

12. I saw a woman walking around kind of lost, and her T-shirt actually said ""If Lost, Please Return to Luke Bryan."" I thought that was pretty cute.

13. Women's acts were scarce this year — none in the nine premium spots of headliner on either stage or No. 2 on the Mane Stage — which made for a one-note experience. I thought Lauren Alaina kind of killed it on the big stage Sunday. Maybe a promotion in future Stagecoaches is in her future.

Buy Photo Lauren Alaina performs on the Mane Stage at Stagecoach Festival in Indio, Calif. on Sunday, April 28, 2019. (Photo: Vickie Connor/The Desert Sun)

14. There is no doubt Bret Michaels is contractually obligated in some way to say the song he's about to sing is from his time with Poison. ""You know this one everybody, it's 'Every Rose Has Its Thorns' by Poison,"" he would say before rolling into one of the band's hits. It was clumsy, but he did it every time.

15. I did not witness any women throw their undergarments on stage at Tom Jones, but there were images on the big screen of women holding some unmentionables up and swinging them around over their heads.

Buy Photo Tom Jones performs at the Stagecoach country music festival, Indio, Calif., April 28, 2019. (Photo: Zoë Meyers/The Desert Sun)

16. A lot of people covered ""Shallow,"" the song made famous by Lady Gaga in ""A Star is Born"" and if it was a contest, the best version came from Danielle Bradberry.

17. It made me think it would have been really cool if Lady Gaga played a Stagecoach set as her character Ally from the movie. It would have been a nice call-back to using the Willie Nelson crowd at Stagecoach in the movie.

18. Rita Wilson's husband watched her Saturday afternoon set from backstage. His name is Tom Hanks, I wonder what he does for a living.

19. The high temperature on the day Luke Bryan headlined was 102 degrees. He had two appropriate songs for the weather ""Sunrise, Sunburn, Sunset"" and ""Rains is a Good Thing.""

20. Neon Carnival, probably the most famous Coachella afterparty complete with big-name celebrities, carnival rides and games, had its Stagecoach debut this year on Saturday night. And it was a hit. People riding bumper cars, playing ring toss and dancing like crazy all into the night. Look for it again next year for sure.

21. Jimmie Allen did something nice during his set on Sunday. He not only spotlighted the military and first-responders as many did before him, but he turned my head by saying ""Are there any teachers in the audience?"" He then gave them a hand and said we need to support teachers in America. Couldn't agree more.

22. Bret Michaels wore a T-shirt with a picture of himself on it during his set. I guess that means it's OK to where a band's T-shirt when you go to see them after all.

23. Almost ate something called a ""Redneck Sundae,"" basically looked like a parfait with (from the bottom to the top) beans, pulled pork, corn, beef, chicken, cole slaw and a big piece of pork belly with little tortilla pieces separating the layers. If it didn't have beans in it I would have tried it.

24. There was a face-palm moment during Luke Bryan's set when he introduce his country bro Cole Swindell to join him on stage. One problem. Swindell wasn't there. Or wasn't ready. After about 45 seconds, when Bryan had started to move on, Swindell rushed out on stage and belted into song ... with a non-functioning microphone. Oh well.

25. I'm going to say what we're all thinking. We need to see Dolly Parton at Stagecoach. A full set would be nice, but I'll take a surprise cameo, too. If I was the event organizers, I would work 9 to 5 every day to make it happen.

26. Men's head wear breakdown at Stagecoach: 70 percent cowboy hat, 20 percent baseball cap, 10 percent Bass Pro Shop baseball cap. I almost went fishing on Monday I saw so many Bass Pro Shop hats.

27. Fun cover song moment: Scotty McCreery did a pretty solid rendition of Ed Sheerhan's ""Shape of You.""

28. Luke Bryan told the crowd: ""Raise your hand if you have to pee right now."" Thousands of hands raised. He then suggested everyone just go ahead and let it run down their leg because it will evaporate quickly. Then after a few seconds, he said, actually that's a bad idea, and to not do it.

29. Ranking the three nostalgia acts (Bret Michaels, Lynyrd Skynrd and Tom Jones): Crowd size: Skynyrd, Jones, Michaels; Vocal strength: Jones, Skynyrd, Michaels; Fun had: Michaels, Skynyrd, Jones.

1436,U.S. Marshals find accused Tulare County child molester in San Diego,"Buddy Joe Sabedra (Photo: Tulare County Sheriff's Department)

An accused child molester has been on the run for more than a year, according to Tulare County sheriff's detectives.

After an extensive search, a 40-year-old Porterville man is on his way back to Tulare County, where the alleged sexual abuse took place.

The investigation into Buddy Joe Sabedra began in December 2016, detectives said.

Deputies were called to the Tule River Reservation for a report of lewd and lascivious acts on a minor under 14.

The name and age of the victim weren't released.

Nearly a year after the December call, a $250,000 warrant was issued for Sabedra.

Sabedra has a history with law enforcement and has a prior assault and battery conviction. According to court records, after pleading to the charge, Sebedra never enrolled in a court-mandated anger management program.

He fled the area, records state.

On April 26, detectives began looking into the possibility of Sabedra hiding out in the San Diego area. Detectives reached out to the U.S. Marshals' Pacific Southwest Regional Fugitive Task Force for help.

Law enforcement scoured the area. Sabedra was eventually found at a home in the 4700 block of Wilson Street in San Diego.

He was arrested and booked into the San Diego County Jail and will be brought back to Tulare County. Once he returns, Tulare County detectives will interrogate the suspect and determine if they’ve found their suspect.

He could be booked as early as today into the Adult Pretrial Facility.

It's unknown if there are more victims or Sabedra's relationship with the child. Detectives didn't release when the alleged abuse began or how long the child claims it lasted.

""The Tulare County Sheriff’s Department and CATTCH Unit would like to thank the United States Marshals Office for their help in catching Sabedra,"" sheriff's officials stated in a press release.

Anyone with information regarding wanted fugitives can call Sgt. Steve Sanchez at 733-6218. Anonymous information about this incident can be reported via Tipnow email:tcso@tipnow.net text or voicemail at 725-4194.

1439,Minor cut leads to flesh-eating infection on Florida man's hand. Black blisters were sign something was very wrong,"A Florida man said he is lucky to be alive after a minor prick from a fishing hook led to a life-threatening, flesh-eating bacterial infection.

Fisherman Mike Walton caught his hand in a fishing hook in the Gulf of Mexico days ago, and didn't think much of it, he told Tampa Bay's WFTS. It's an injury he said he's had hundreds of times while fishing.

But, his hand began to swell — with large black blisters. Usual antibiotics weren't working. So, Walton drove himself to an emergency room, where doctors told him he needed surgery or he might lose his arm or worse.

“They said in a few hours, this would have gone up my arm into my chest and I wouldn’t have been here. There was no saving me,” Walton told Florida's FOX 13.

Doctors considered amputating his arm, but were able to remove the bacteria from skin tissue between his elbow and the palm of his hand, he said.

""I got real lucky on this one,"" he told WFTS.

The flesh-eating infection, necrotizing fasciitis, is rare and deadly. Bacteria that causes it can enter the body through even small breaks in the skin and spreads quickly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Walton, who works in construction, said this injury won't stop him from fishing in the future.

""I want to go right now,"" he said. ""It ain't going to slow me down. It's one thing I enjoy.""

Doctors told Walton the infection is contained, he said, but he'll likely need to be on antibiotics for another month, and require additional weeks to heal.

1444,Dog killed in Tulare County drive-by shooting,"Close up crime scene investigation police boundary tape (Photo: File)

A high-speed chase through portions of northern Tulare County led to the arrest of a 29-year-old man accused of a drive-by shooting.

Although no humans were injured in the shooting, a dog was shot and killed, according to Tulare County deputies.

On Wednesday, deputies in Orosi were in the area of Avenue 416 and Road 130 in Orosi on an unrelated call when they heard multiple gunshots.

While searching the area for bullet holes and victims, deputies found a dog that had been shot near the area where the gunman's vehicle was last seen.

Crime technicians are working to trace the bullets back to the weapon used in the shooting.

A vehicle sped away from the area.

Deputies tried to stop the vehicle but the driver refused to pull over. Deputies took chase through the areas of Cutler, Orosi and Dinuba. The chase eventually ended near Road 80 and Avenue 360.

Michael Balderas, 29, was arrested in connection to the shooting. However, a second suspect fled on foot and is still on the loose.

Balderas was booked into Bob Wiley Detention Facility on suspicion of animal cruelty, conspiracy to commit a crime, discharge of a firearm, and evading an officer.

His bail was set at $115,000. He is expected in court later this week.

California's general animal cruelty law allows prosecutors to charge a defendant with a misdemeanor or felony. The charge depends on the specific facts of the case and the defendant's criminal history.

A misdemeanor can land a defendant in jail for a year and cost them up to $20,000. The penalties for felony animal abuse in California is up to three years in prison and a fine of $20,000.

Balderas could also face various gun charges.

Ultimately, Tulare County prosecutors will decide whether there is enough evidence to charge Balderas.

1445,Palm Springs homicide suspect to be arraigned in death of 75-year-old woman,"CLOSE 2018 had the lowest homicide rate in this decade for the Coachella Valley. Palm Springs Desert Sun

The man accused of killing a 75-year-old Palm Springs woman earlier this week is due for arraignment in court on Thursday afternoon.

Stephen McKernan, 76, is scheduled to appear about 1:30 p.m. in Riverside County Superior Court at Larson Justice Center in Indio. It will be his first public appearance since he was arrested Monday night on suspicion of killing Clarie Carsman.

Officers found Carsman's body about 6 p.m. Monday at a home in the 300 block of Pico Road, according to Palm Springs police.

She had suffered ""significant trauma,"" investigators said.

Sgt. Mike Casavan confirmed it was McKernan who notified police. Police later identified him as a suspect in Carsman's death.

Police described McKernan as a house guest who had known the victim and her husband for several years. But the victim's friend, who said she also was her former caretaker, told KESQ that there was no indication Carsman and McKernan knew each other.

As of Thursday, McKernan remained at the Southwest Detention Center in Murrieta with bail set at $1 million.

There was no sign of police activity outside the Pico Road home this week and several neighbors told The Desert Sun they knew little about its occupants.

1456,"Stagecoach 2019 opens with a celebration of beer, country music, Western heritage and more beer","Stagecoach: California’s Country Music Festival — or Disneyland for beer drinkers, as some people call it — got off to a rolling start Friday.

The Empire Polo Club in Indio has been reconfigured with Western themes since the Coachella festival of the past two weekends, and beer-drinking is celebrated at watering holes throughout the grounds, as well as in numerous country songs.

That's just one of the cultural differences between Stagecoach and Coachella. The installation art is different, too. Instead of the surrealistic astronauts prominent at Coachella, much of the Stagecoach art starts with the letters “TR”: Tractors, trailers and trucks are parked throughout the vast lawns of dried grass.

Other signs of distinction can be found in the shopping areas. Nikki Lane’s Stage Stop Marketplace has shops with names like High Class Hillbilly, Trendy & Tipsy, and We Are Witchy. The Sahara tent at Coachella is now a giant shell of a structure occupied by kids in a Half-Pint Hootenanny. It feels like a quaint shanty-town compared to the high-tech productions of BLACKPINK and Jaden Smith at Coachella, but kids get the opportunity to perform and there are cool decorative touches, including a real stagecoach, a log cabin and a hootenanny jail.

Two landmarks in the far southern reaches of Stagecoach are 30-foot boots set on 10-foot pedestals. But, you don't need landmarks to find a place to drink at this festival. Places to buy beer, wine and even exotic alcoholic beverages are as prevalent as neighborhood bars in old New York. There’s a Budweiser Country Club and next to it is the Opry Gallery, with historic photos of the Grand Ole Opry on the walls and sawdust on the floor, and a bar that serves beer.

There’s a row of six vendors selling wine, beer and craft cocktails, and then wine, beer and craft cocktails. At one end is a general store selling aspirin. Next to it is a wine bar called Barefoot, which gives away swag to people willing to write a positive message and leave it in a drop box.

The three-day event just sold out on Friday, and many of the attendees come with friends and family for a weekend getaway or vacation. Jaime Brack of La Quinta, who attends the festival every year with his family and friends, said beer not only makes the festival more fun, it makes the triple-digit heat more tolerable.

“It’s hot, but it’s bearable,” said Brack, holding a beer in one hand. “If you’re in the shade, it’s beautiful. It’s three days of a lot of eating and drinking, but, once you start drinking, it keeps you cool. It’s a mindset.”

Willie and Rhonda Eide bought a second home in La Quinta last June, so they flew from their primary residency in Montana with friends who are big country fans.

""This is the place to go,"" Willie said. “Why wouldn’t you come here?” added Rhonda. “You’ve got to experience all that stuff.”

Besides eating, drinking and shopping for merchandise ranging from Western knick-knacks to an Estee Lauder Beauty Arcade, Stagecoach features a vast variety of music, from the modern country of Friday headliner Luke Bryan to the American rock of Bret Michaels, the lead singer of the heavy metal band, Poison, who has become a television personality in the past 15 years on reality shows.

For the second year in a row, there’s less bluegrass than the old days of Stagecoach. Dan Tyminski, who played with the Grammy Award-winning bluegrass artist Alison Krauss and Union Station for more than 25 years, sang and played acoustic guitar on “Man of Constant Sorrow,” which he recorded as one of the Soggy Bottom Boys in “O Brother, Where Art Thou,” starring George Clooney. He quipped in reference to the heat, “I think we have some soggy bottoms in the house.”

But Tyminski performed with an ensemble consisting of mostly electric guitarists, an electric bassist and a keyboard player, and he said his change of style from bluegrass can be mostly attributed to recording with electronic artist Avicii, who died last year at age 29. Tyminski played the song they recorded, “Hey Brother,” and called Avicci’s death, “a huge tragedy. But his music will live on.”

The Cordovas, featuring Joe Firstman, Carson Daly’s former bandleader from the early morning talk show, “Last Call,” played a 30-minute set at 1:30 p.m. and managed to squeeze in a jam of the Grateful Dead’s “Truckin’,” before ending with a more traditional Stagecoach number: Merle Haggard’s “I Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink.” The band tore it up and Firstman said afterwards it was worth interrupting a Southern tour.

“This is a nice gig,” he said. “They’re treating us real well.”

The Cordovas played in the Palomino tent, which is designated for more “alternative” country artists, which can mean anything from older performers like Sammy Kershaw, who is scheduled to play the tent at 6:10 p.m. Saturday, to Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd, who will follow Kershaw as headliners in the Palomino.

Up-and-coming Nashville artists played the Sirius XM Spotlight stage, set up in front of the Mane Stage, before Devin Dawson's Mane Stage set at 4 p.m. Tyler Rich, a Nashville artist originally from Yuba City, Calif., played at 3:20 p.m. on the Sirius XM stage and said, “We picked the perfect time to be at Stagecoach.

Dawson sang “California Grown” about how he’s been trying to return to California for the past 10 years because, “every time I leave I just wanna come back home/I'm California grown.”

Hot up-and-comer Kane Brown, who, at 25, is the same age as McCreery, was then pitted against Michaels at 7:40 p.m.

He opened with the weather-appropriate ""Feelin' It"" about ""that summertime feelin',"" before strapping on a guitar and playing songs reflecting the changes in his life. ""Boys From Back Home,"" opening with what sounded like a classic Who riff, reminisced about his days before he became famous, and ""This Is It"" is a song he wrote while thinking about proposing to the woman who became his wife last June.

1465,"Bruce Springsteen announces new solo album 'Western Stars,' his first in five years","CLOSE If you couldn't get tickets to Bruce Springsteen's Broadway performance, you can watch it at home on Netflix in a new film by director Thom Zimny, who has a long relationship with “The Boss.” (Dec. 13) AP

Go West, young man.

Bruce Springsteen will release a new studio album called ‘Western Stars’ on June 14 from Columbia Records. A single, “Hello Sunshine,” and a corresponding video will drop at midnight Friday, April 26.

It's the Boss' first new album in five years.

The record draws “inspiration in part from the Southern California pop records of the late ‘60s and early ‘70s,” according to a press release from Springsteen.

That’s an intriguing proposition. The Southern California scene of the period was marked by songwriting craftsmanship, lush harmonies, electric folk and a burgeoning country-rock influence.

“This record is a return to my solo recordings featuring character-driven songs and sweeping, cinematic orchestral arrangements,” said Springsteen in a statement. “It’s a jewel box of a record.”

The Springsteen albums with “character-driven songs” in the last few years include “Devils & Dust” and “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” but the lineup on “Western Stars,” and the description of “sweeping, cinematic orchestral arrangements,” suggests a more expansive musical palette.

David Sancious, a member of the E Street Band in the early ‘70s, and Charlie Giordano and Soozie Tyrell, who presently play with the E Street Band, are on the new album, as is Patti Scialfa, Springsteen’s wife and a member of E Street. A new member of the Springsteen sphere is Jon Brion, who plays celeste, Moog, and farfisa keyboards. He’s formerly a member of the alt-rock band the Bats who went on to produce (Kanye West’s “Late Registration”) and score films (“Magnolia” and “Punch-Drunk Love”).

Ron Aniello is the producer. He also produced the Boss’ “High Hopes” and “Wrecking Ball.”

Springsteen has spoken of “Western Stars” previously, suggesting that it was recorded before his run in “Springsteen on Broadway,” which spanned from October 2017 to December 2018.

“That record is influenced by Southern California pop music of the ‘70s,” Springsteen told Variety in 2017. “Glen Campbell, Jimmy Webb, Burt Bacharach, those kinds of records. I don’t know if people will hear those influences, but that was what I had in my mind. It gave me something to hook an album around; it gave me some inspiration to write.”

The album was teased on Springsteen’s social media account this week with rustic, haunting images from what appeared to be the Joshua Tree National Park in California and other points west.

Springsteen has stated that he will not be touring with the E Street Band in 2019. The “Western Stars” release did not include any info about solo shows, nor did it suggest any were coming.

“Before I go back to my day job, the year will be consumed with a break after our Broadway run and various recording projects I’ve been working on,” said Springsteen, 69, on social media last December. “We do hope to see you soon, and until then, we have some mighty E Streeters out there regularly performing with their own projects who’d love and deserve your support.”

Upcoming albums from E Street Band members include “Summer of Sorcery” from Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul on May 3; “Blue with Lou” from Nils Lofgren on Friday, April 26; and a new album from Jake Clemons.

“Western Stars” will be available for pre-order on Friday, April 26. Visit www.brucespringsteen.net for more information.

1466,22-year-old man dies in single-vehicle crash near International Agri-Center,"A 22-year-old Tulare man is dead after he lost control of his vehicle near the International Agri-Center. (Photo: Sheyanne N Romero)

Hidden in a tall field was a badly mangled vehicle.

Pieces of the car were scattered along the roadway in southern Tulare.

The 22-year-old man behind the wheel was ejected from the vehicle and died at the scene. Now, Tulare police are working to piece together what led to the fatal single-vehicle crash.

Around 6 a.m. on Thursday, officers responded to a report of a rollover crash on Laspina Street, just south of Paige Avenue near the International Agri-Center.

When officers arrived, they found a severely damaged vehicle in a nearby field. The man, who hasn't been identified, was found nearby. Police are waiting until the man's family was notified.

There were no witnesses to the crash and no other vehicles were involved, according to police.

""The vehicle was found in an unlit field and not easily seen by passing motorists,"" said Sgt. Eddie Hinojosa.

Officers interviewed nearby residents who said they heard the sounds of tires screeching around midnight, but it's unclear if the crash is related. Evidence found at the scene showed the victim likely died two hours before he was found.

It wasn't until a passing motorist spotted it on his way to work, as the sun came up, that police were called.

Officers believe speed was a factor. The driver may have lost control and slammed into the center median while headed south on Laspina.

Police said he was not wearing a seat belt.

Cameron Joseph Kearney, accused of engaging in a shootout with Indio police in Bermuda Dunes on April 20, has an extensive criminal history including an alleged racially-motivated assault and a previous fight with police officers.

Kearney, 28, appeared at the Larson Justice Center in Indio on Wednesday and pleaded not guilty to two charges of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer and one charge of possessing a firearm as a felon for his part in Friday’s shootout.

The shooting occurred just before 11 p.m. when officers arrived at MiraBella Apartments in Bermuda Dunes to investigate a suspected assault at the Tropics Motor Hotel in Indio, police spokesman Ben Guitron said.

At the apartment complex, Kearney shot at police and officers returned fire, Guitron said.

Desert Regional SWAT team responded soon after, according to a statement released by the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department. Kearney eventually surrendered to police and was booked into the Indio jail on the afternoon of April 20.

Ultimately, nobody was injured in the shooting, Guitron said. The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department is investigating the incident and the officers involved were placed on administrative leave, which is normal protocol according to the Indio Police Department policy.

But the shootout was just the latest in Kearney’s history of run-ins in with the law in the Coachella Valley. Kearney has 14 cases in the Riverside County Superior Court, stretching as far back as 2009. About half are vehicle code violations for driving under the influence, using a cell phone while driving, and driving with a suspended license. The rest are drug, battery and assault charges.

In October 2018, Kearney was involved in a traffic collision, then fled the scene. According to the arrest warrant filed in that case, CHP officers found Kearney at the same Bermuda Dunes apartment complex where the shooting would later occur. Kearney later pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor hit and run charge.

In 2012, a woman told police Kearney assaulted her near the Palm Desert High School parking lot, in what the arresting officer described as a “battery/possible hate crime.”

During that incident, the Vasquez family was attempting to exit Palm Desert High School parking lot when Kearney cut in front of their car, according to the arrest warrant. Kearney then parked and blocked traffic while he spoke with a security guard at the school. When Annamaria Vasquez began telling Kearney to move his vehicle, he started to act erratically.

Kearney yelled at, and threatened to fight the passengers. The Vasquez family attempted to drive away, but Kearney accosted them again at an intersection nearby.

Kearney exited his car during a red light and walked up to Annamaria Vasquez’s window. He spat on Vasquez and told her to exit the vehicle calling her racial slurs and threatening to fight her and her family members. The Vasquez family got away safely, but reported the incident to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department.

When a deputy later questioned the defendant about the incident, Kearney said he was at the school to pick up his high school transcripts. Kearney alleged the Vasquez family instigated the argument and that he was defending himself. He denied calling Vasquez a racial slur, but admitted that he “uses slang words and he sometimes uses that type of language.” Kearney was arrested on one battery charge, but the case was eventually dismissed for lack of evidence.

On Nov. 7, 2015, Kearney again had a run-in with authorities, but this time in Palm Springs. Kearney attacked a group of people on the street, according to the arrest warrant, “for an unknown and unprovoked reason.”

During the attack, Kearney punched two people in their faces. A couple, who were eating in front of a nearby restaurant tried to intervene, but Kearney then turned on them. After he threw a metal chair at the couple, one of them wrestled Kearney to the ground, holding him down while police were called. While Kearney eventually escaped on foot, another witness followed him and was able to tell police where he was. Kearney then wrestled with police officers when they arrived to arrest him.

Kearney pleaded guilty to a felony charge of violence against a police officer and a misdemeanor battery charge. He agreed in his plea deal to complete treatment for substance abuse.

Kearney was arrested for battery and disturbing the peace in Bermuda Dunes on Sept. 27, 2017. And in December 2018, Kearney pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed knife.

Kearney is next due in court on May 7, 2019.

1483,Bret Michaels review: The five major moments from former Poison front man's set,"Seldom do you see an act as appreciative to be on stage as Bret Michaels was Friday night when he kicked it old school and rocked the Palomino.

Time and time again during his set, he stopped to say how happy he was to be there and you could tell he was sincere. It set a nice tone for a set that, much to the fans' delight was injected with a whole lot of Poison.

Michaels was almost in the role of party MC more than rock star, but man he was having fun and he never ran out of energy. Not a bad show for the 56-year-old.

Here are the five biggest takeaways from Michaels' hour-long set.

Drinking: Guide to the best bars at the festival

Celebrities: These are the stars we spotted at the festival

Military moment

The best moment of the night was definitely a touching one as Michaels brought out about 25 military men and women and first-responders to honor them while he played the Poison hit ""Something to Believe in."" The crowd bathed the ""true rock stars"" as Michaels called them with heart-felt cheers and a cell phone light serenade. In fact, due to the demographics of the crowd, there were even a few lighters held up. Sometimes moments like these can come off hokey or ham-fisted, but this one didn't.

Powerfully Poisonous

Michaels rolled through the biggies from Poison. Each time he curiously introduced the song by very clearly (contractually obligated?) stating that it was a Poison song. He'd say something like, ""Let's kick this off with a Poison song 'Talk Dirty To Me.'"" Or you know this one, it's Poison's 'Ride the Wind'"" He finished by playing the two biggies which turned into a pretty fun sing-along: ""Every Rose Has Its Thorns"" and ""Nothin' But A Good Time."" Excuse me, I meant to say Poison's ""Every Rose Has Its Thorns"" and ""Nothin' But A Good Time.""

The outfit

You know that age-old debate about whether or not you should where a T-shirt with the band on it that you are going to see in concert that night. Is that acceptable or lame? Well Michaels blew that debate out of the water. He wore a black T-shirt, with a picture of, well, himself on the front. The back had a famous quote, by, well, himself on it ""Life without music would suck."" Of course, he had his triple-thick red bandanna on throughout and put his red, white and blue cowboy hat on when he was paying tribute to the military group.

Family moment

He did play one new song. And he said he co-wrote with his daughter Jorja Bleu. Jorja Bleu and his other daughter Raine Elizabath came out on stage to start the show and introduce their dad. The new song was called ""Unbroken"" and, according to him you can hear it at bretmichaels.com.

Busy bro

The show was part of an active day for Michaels, who spent about an hour earlier in the day shaking hands and talking to people in the media tent area, both those who requested an interview and those that didn't.

About three hours before his set, he joined grill master Guy Fieri for a little cooking demonstration. Country star Cole Swindell also was part of it, but Michaels put in most of the hard work to the delight of the fans watching and rooting them on around the grill.

1491,Driver in L.A. hit-and-run death of Australian man arrested,"- The driver in a deadly hit-and-run near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Formosa Avenue in the early hours of April 18, 2019, has been arrested.

He was identified by police as 19-year-old Kristopher Ryan Smith of Norwalk. Smith surrendered himself with legal representation to the Los Angeles Police Department-Hollywood Division, according to police officials.

Smith's bail was set at $50,000.

Investigators say Smith was driving east on Sunset Boulevard at about 1:30 a.m. when he hit 56-year-old Andrew Mallard walking south on Fermosa Avenue without stopping to help. Mallard was an Australian man who had spent 12 years in a Western Australian jail before he was freed after investigators learned he was innocent. He was in L.A. visiting his fiancé when he was killed.

Surveillance video from nearby businesses caught Mallard walking into a nearby liquor store to buy a pack of smokes before heading towards a car that looks to be his Uber. When he realizes it isn't, the Australian man begins crossing the seemingly empty street while looking at his phone when suddenly, a silver car speeds down the road and hits him.

A witness runs out onto Sunset waving for help as the silver car keeps going. Mallard was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police did not immediately release additional details and a booking photo of Smith has not been made available.

ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) — A man who gained Internet fame as “Kai the Hatchet-Wielding Hitchhiker” has been convicted of first-degree murder in the beating death of a New Jersey man almost six years ago.

Jurors in Union County convicted 30-year-old Caleb “Kai” McGillvary on Wednesday in the May 2013 death of 73-year-old lawyer Joseph Galfy. Authorities said the two met in New York and the defendant stayed at Galfy’s home. McGillvary was arrested in Philadelphia days later.

McGillvary alleged that he acted in self-defense following an attempted sexual assault, but prosecutors said his statements were inconsistent and also cited the victim’s extensive injuries.

The Canadian gained some online fame after intervening in a 2012 assault on a California utility worker in which he described using a hatchet to fend off a further attack.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - California prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty if they convict the man suspected of being a notorious California serial killer who eluded capture for decades.

BREAKING: district attorneys announce they will seek the death penalty if suspected Golden State Killer Joseph DeAngelo is convicted.



His attorney says she has no comment. pic.twitter.com/DZBiDq2V6h — Ashley Zavala (@ZavalaA) April 10, 2019

The move comes less than a month after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on executing any of the 737 inmates on the nation’s largest death row.

Prosecutors from four counties announced their decision one after another Wednesday during a brief court hearing for Joseph DeAngelo, jailed as the suspected “Golden State Killer.”

He was arrested a year ago based on DNA evidence linking him to at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes across California in the 1970s and ’80s.

He has yet to enter a plea on 26 charges.

He stood expressionless and defense attorney Diane Howard did not comment.
