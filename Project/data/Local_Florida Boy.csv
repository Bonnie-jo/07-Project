A Florida radio station is in the news again thanks to a controversial contest.

For the second year in a row, Fort Myers's 103.9 is giving away a round of in vitro fertilization for a couple struggling with infertility.

The man behind the giveaway, host Jason “Big Mama” Jones told Fox 4 News last year that he and his wife came up with the idea after turning to IVF.

""I know the struggle so I know it was going to change someone's life,"" said Sara Jones, Big Mama's wife.

“And we realized one in eight people struggle with infertility and we said, ‘Hey, let’s make a miracle happen,'"" Big Mama added.

The radio station has partnered with IVFMD in Naples and S.M.P. pharmacies to make the contest happen.

Those who would like to enter the contest must submit a four-minute video on the station's website.

“Tell us your story, tell the world why you want to be a parents,” said Big Mama. “You have to go to B1039.com right now and get ready. Upload your video this Monday.""

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - A Florida woman was arrested last week after her daughter's school found ""hundreds of bugs"" in the girl's backpack, prompting the Florida Department of Children and Families to visit their home, the Pensacola News Journal reported.

Jessica Stevenson, 33, of Milton, was arrested on five counts of child neglect without causing great bodily harm.

The DCF conducted a wellness check at her home after Bagdad Elementary School staff member made a report concerning three siblings who attended the elementary school, according to an affidavit.

The employee noted that her second-grade daughter had been wearing the same clothing for a week. When asked when her last bath had been, the student said she did not know, authorities said.

On one occasion, “hundreds of bugs crawled out” of the student’s “backpack in the lunchroom,” the report stated.

A teacher said the school had repeatedly given the girl clean clothing, but each new outfit would be worn continuously until it was worn out and another outfit would be provided by the school.

The teacher also noted that the girl was frequently crying, “having meltdowns” and seemed depressed, the report stated.

The girl has four other siblings between the ages of 5 and 14, two of which attend Bagdad Elementary School.

When deputies visited Stevenson's home, they discovered an infestation of roaches, broken windows and bags of trash throughout the home and yard.

“The roaches were on nearly every surface in the home” including “on the children’s mattress, in the pots and pans in the kitchen, and inside the cabinets/fridge,"" the report stated.

There was no edible food inside of the home. The cabinets were empty of food and the refrigerator had two cartons of spoiled milk, spoiled eggs, sugar and a stick of butter.

Stevenson's bedroom, however, was ""abnormally"" clean with minimal roaches and a stashed bag of snacks, according to the report.

Stevenson was charged with five felony counts of child neglect without great bodily harm and booked into the Santa Rosa County Jail Friday. She was released Saturday on a $2,500 bond.

In an interview with Pensacola ABC affiliate WEAR, the mother disputed the report, claiming she had been targeted ""unfairly.""

""I'm not a bad mom, I do everything I can. I work hard,"" Stevenson told Pensacola ABC affiliate WEAR on Tuesday. ""They just made it harder for me.""

Stevenson said she was given a no-contact order for her children, which have been temporarily removed from her care.",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-mom-charged-after-hundreds-of-bugs-found-in-child-s-backpack/1994125202,2019-05-10T11:13:55Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

13,Judge orders 3-year-old Florida boy to undergo chemo,"TAMPA, Fla. - Court-ordered chemotherapy treatment will resume Thursday for a 3-year-old boy who is battling cancer, WTSP-TV reported.

A Hillsborough County judge on Wednesday ordered the parents of Noah McAdams to provide him with chemo treatment, which is expected to last 28 days.

According to Florida law, the state can mandate medical treatment for a child in a life-or-death situation.

Doctors diagnosed McAdams with leukemia last month. He has been through one round of chemotherapy at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital.

His parents believed the chemotherapy would do more harm than good, so they took him to Kentucky to look for alternative treatments. They wanted to use CBD oil, fresh foods, Alkaline water and other measures to treat him.

The Florida Department of Children and Families put Noah in the custody of his grandparents.

The judge heard from three doctors and decided chemotherapy was the best option.

A 911 call from a lonely 6-year-old boy could have ended with stern discipline instead of a stuffed animal and perhaps a budding friendship.

More: 'Hundreds of bugs' in child's backpack, poor hygiene, leads to Florida mom's arrest

The boy, who's name hasn't been released, said his mom was ""mean"" and made him cry, according to the 911 call. The dispatcher stayed on the line and asked him several questions, including his age, address and where were his parents, who were unaware their son called 911.

Tallahassee Police Officer Joe White was en route when the boy called a few more times to make sure an officer was coming. Once he arrived, the boy asked if he and White could be friends.

The Tallahassee Police Department posted on Facebook pictures of White and the boy holding a stuffed animal given by White. The officer informed the boy of when to use 911.

TPD spokesman Damon Miller told the Tallahassee Democrat the social media post was made by another public information officer so he couldn't confirm whether White made contact with the boy's parents before the post was made public.

Here’s Officer Joe White's his new friend, who called 911 because he was lonely. (Photo: Tallahassee Police Department)

Steve Harrelson, director of the Consolidated Dispatch Agency, said it's rare that a child calls 911 because they're lonely.

""Realizing he was a child, we put some extra attention to that,"" said Harrelson, who urged parents to teach their children about 911. ""It was a great conclusion to an incident that could have been a lot worse. (White) used that moment to educate the uses of 911 ... It worked all the way around for everyone.""

Miller said White did what most officers do every day, but most people don't know about. He said it's not unusual for officers to have similar encounters with children.

""He let the young man know that they can be his friend and how to use the 911,"" Miller said. ""This is a classic example that we are humans as well, and we are not robots.""

18,Broadway hit 'Newsies' comes to Florida Rep with 51 actors from all over SWFL,"Christian Dinsmore, Sawyer True and Keehnon Jackson in a publicity photo for Florida Rep's ""Newsies."" (Photo: Joseph Herrera)

It’s the biggest musical Kody C. Jones has ever directed — and it might be one of the biggest to play Florida Repertory Theatre, too.

The show, itself, was a huge Broadway hit. “Newsies” won Tony Awards for Best Choreography and Best Original Score in 2012. Plus it was nominated for Best Musical, too.

And then there’s the Florida Rep cast: A sprawling 51 people, mostly teens, singing and dancing onstage. It's so big, in fact, that Jones had to cast actors from as far away as Naples for the Fort Myers production.

“We’ve never done a really, really big Broadway musical,” says Jones, who heads Florida Rep’s Education Department and directs its youth-theater production of ""Newsies.” “It’s just kind of time.”

The musical is performed mostly by students in Florida Rep’s Conservatory program for young actors and theater artists. It tells the story of the real-life 1899 newsboys strike in New York City, where the poor orphans and runaways who sold newspapers on the street demonstrated for two weeks over planned newspaper price increases.

Some of the newsies in Florida Rep's ""Newsies"": Sawyer True, Matteo Occhino, Caleb Edwards, Christian Dinsmore and Matthew Eakins. (Photo: Joseph Herrera)

Sure, most of the kids acting in “Newsies” don’t know much about newsprint, Jones says. They get their news online and on social media.

But the story still resonates for today’s teens, thanks to recent youth movements to push for gun control and other political change. It involves kids and their voices — voices that need to be heard, voices that can change the world for the better.

“That’s what this show is all about,” Jones says.

The story takes on still-relevant issues such as workers’ rights and womens’ rights, Jones says, and it does it with high-energy songs, lots of dancing and a story that grabs you in from the start.

That’s why teen actor Jesse Massari loves the show. She’s a fan of both the 2012 Broadway musical and the original 1992 Disney movie it’s based on.

“It’s the story,” says Massari, 18, a senior at Cypress Lake High School in south Fort Myers. “It just draws you in. … It’s just putting yourself in these people’s shoes and their struggle.”

Massari plays a female newspaper reporter who champions the newsboys’ cause. “She meets the newsboys and falls in love with their mission and what they’re striking for,” she says.

One of those newsboys is “Crutchie,” a polio-stricken 14-year-old with a crippled leg.

“He’s the underdog of the show,” says actor Matteo Occhino, 17, of Fort Myers, who plays the character in the Florida Rep production.

Occhino says he’s been having a great time working on the massive, energetic musical. “It’s a fun, powerful show,” says Occhino, a Cypress Lake High junior. “It’s just an experience. I’ve never worked on a show like this before.”

That’s not all that’s happening with Florida Rep’s Theatre Conservatory Program and Education Department, either.

After being discovered in a West Virginia cave, Bat Boy finds love and a new family, but then a revealed secret shatters his newfound happiness and shocks the entire town.

“The Parkland Project” (summer 2020, specific dates to be announced): Education Director Jones conceived of this two-part social-justice project that includes a world-premiere theatrical production written by playwright Eric Coble (“Refugee”). Local students will do research and interviews exploring the 2018 Parkland shootings, and then Coble will craft that material into a play designed to inspire people and start a conversation about the future. Jones will direct.

Rob Thomas

Rob Thomas is known as the front-man for Matchbox 20, but perhaps his greatest claim to fame was singing on Santana's wildly successful song ""Smooth"" that he co-wrote.

It won three Grammys in 2000, including Song of the Year and as last year Billboard considered the second most successful song of all time after Chubby Checker's 1960 hit ""The Twist.""

Thomas and his ""Chip Tooth Tour"" into the Sunshine State this summer, with concerts set for July 2 at Mizner Park in Boca Raton; July 3 at Hard Rock Live Orlando; July 5 at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg; and July 6 at Daily's Place in Jacksonville.

His Matchbox 20 hits have remained pop music staples in recent years, including ""Real World,""""3AM"" and ""Push.""

Brian Regan (Photo: Brian Friedman)

Brian Regan

Jerry Seinfeld has called him one of his favorite comedians, and Brian Regan has earned his stature among standup legends.

The South Florida native tours it seems constantly, and returns to Florida with shows July 26 at Barbara B. Mann Hall in Fort Myers with tickets around $50 each.

The next night, Regan is at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg and tickets start around $40.

Regan is known for his clean comedy, with popular skits including ""Say Eight"" and ""Doughnut Lady.""

He still prides himself on being able to walk in public pretty much anonymously; a few years ago in an interview with the Naples Daily News, Regan discussed how he and his children had just spent a day at Disney World in Orlando and he went unrecognized.

- WARNING: This story may have content that is graphic due to the nature of the crime.

A pit bull that suffered injuries after being dragged behind truck in Weeki Wachee, Florida appears to be recovering nicely and even wagging his tail!

Nature Coast Animal Wellness & Surgical Center has been posting updates about the dog, who has now been named Oliver North by the staff.

""He is very sore but is doing good!"" the center wrote on Facebook. ""Jewell, One of our Vet technicians took him home for the weekend to make him as comfortable as possible in a “home” environment!""

""He is tolerating his treatment without hesitation and that tail is wagging like nothing ever happened! What a sweet baby we have here!""

Oliver was spotted by the center's owner, Jan Johnson, being dragged behind a truck down Northcliffe Blvd. on Friday.

""He came loose and flew into the median at which point he was rescued.""

Photos posted to Facebook show the horrific injuries Oliver endured. He was covered in scrapes and cuts all over its body from the dragging. Fortunately, veterinarians say the dog had no broken bones, but they are monitoring for internal bleeding.

The center posted video of Oliver limping around after being rescued. He was sore, but they say he is a very sweet boy.

The center says Oliver appears to be about 1 to 2-years-old and had no microchip. He will stay at the center to heal and then put up for adoption.

The truck is described as an older, full-size pickup with faded dark blue paint that appeared to be hauling furniture and junk in the cab. Anyone with information is asked to call the Hernando County Sheriff's Office at 352-754-6830.

35,Florida lawmakers take steps to revamp criminal justice laws,"Florida lawmakers on Friday overwhelmingly approved a criminal-justice package that includes the first change in 35 years to the legal threshold for felony theft and reducing punishment for some non-violent offenders. (Photo: File)

TALLAHASSEE — Florida lawmakers on Friday overwhelmingly approved a criminal-justice package that includes the first change in 35 years to the legal threshold for felony theft and reducing punishment for some non-violent offenders.

Supporters said the legislation, which now heads to Gov. Ron DeSantis, is an “important first step” to addressing problems in Florida’s criminal-justice system, with some lawmakers saying they would like to see it go further.

“Obviously, there’s more that I wish we could have done,” said Sen. Jeff Brandes, a St. Petersburg Republican who sponsored the bill (HB 7125) in the Senate. “I hope over the next few years we will cast a bold vision for what criminal justice should look like in this state.”

At the start of the legislative session, Brandes proposed a package that would have allowed thousands of non-violent offenders to be released from prison earlier for good behavior. It also would have given judges more leeway over sentences of nonviolent drug offenders.

But the Senate could not reach a compromise on some of the biggest changes proposed by Brandes, and a deal was struck to strip a number of provisions as the legislative session prepared to end. Lawmakers were expected to finish most of the session Friday, returning Saturday only to pass a budget.

The House voted 110-0 on Friday to give final approval to the package, which the Senate approved in a 39-1 vote Thursday. Only Sen. Randolph Bracy, D-Orlando, voted against the bill.

House sponsor Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, issued a statement after Friday's vote that said, in part, the idea behind the measure was to ""establish common-sense reforms"" for people convicted of low-level, non-violent crimes.

“We believe this criminal justice package is a tremendous step in the right direction in reducing barriers to work and opportunity and providing employment assistance for those with a criminal record, which we believe will further reduce our crime rate,” Renner said.

The package includes, among many things, raising the felony-theft threshold from $300 to $750. The House has initially sought to increase the threshold to $1,000, but that came down amid strong opposition from some of the state’s largest retailers like Walgreens and Walmart.

“It’s a long time coming,” said Rep. Wengay Newton, D-St. Petersburg. Using an example of a 14-year-old boy who stole a cell phone and had a felony on his record, Newton said raising the threshold “gives young people opportunities so they can come back.”

Other changes praised by Republicans and Democrats in both chambers included expanding the availability of inmate reentry programs and offering more opportunities for felons to get occupational licenses.

Also, the bill would raise the base threshold amount for trafficking in hydrocodone from 14 grams to 28 grams, and non-violent drug offenders would have their driver's licenses suspended for six months instead of a year.

But lawmakers didn’t go as far as many criminal-justice reform advocates wanted. For example, the Senate agreed to scrap a proposal that would have allowed convicted non-violent offenders to be released from prison after serving 65 percent of their sentences instead of 85 percent for good behavior.

Another proposal that did not make it across the finish line would have allowed people who committed aggravated assaults or attempted aggravated assaults to have sentences reduced if their crimes took place before July 1, 2016, when the Legislature had harsher mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines for those crimes.

Tossing some of these proposals frustrated people such as Bracy, who said he was “tired of submitting to the will of the House” on issues.

But other reform advocates, including some conservative-leaning groups, were supportive of the package overall.

“This is only the beginning, and we are so encouraged by the appetite to shift resources from the bricks and mortar of prison to developing better interventions to reduce recidivism, prevent victimization and promote public safety,” said Chelsea Murphy, the Florida state director for Right on Crime, which is backed by Koch Industries and the conservative Koch network of donors.

50,"Mom sues school, says bus driver dragged biracial student on purpose","WEST POINT, Utah (KUTV/KSTU) - A Utah mother is suing a school district after a bus dragged her child for almost 200 feet.

She says it's because her son is biracial. The bus driver says he's being framed.

Surveillance video from inside the bus shows several students getting off before driver John Naisbitt closes the bus doors right behind the 14-year-old boy.

""I couldn't even comprehend how it happened,"" said Brenda Mayes, the boy's mother.

The video shows students panicking as the bus moves forward for an estimated 20 seconds, dragging the child close to the tires.

""I was glad he didn't kill him. I was glad he didn't go under the wheels,"" Mayes said.

She argues Naisbitt shouldn't have even been driving the bus on February 4. The suit argues he had a history of misconduct against children of color dating back to 2017.

""Something failed. They have a responsibility when I put my kids, send them off to school, they have a responsibility to make sure they are safe,"" Mayes said.

To keep from getting fired, Naisbitt said he retired three days after the incident.

When asked if he was racist, he said, ""Not at all, no. Look at my dog, he's black as could be.""

Naisbitt says eight buses were lined up behind his when he warned the students he was moving forward.

He argues the incident was staged after he disciplined the boy's brother.

""I didn't see him in there. If I would have, I would have stopped,"" Naisbitt said.

In response to the suit, the district said any issues of discrimination are thoroughly investigated:

The Davis School District takes any claims of racial discrimination seriously and does not tolerate any form of racial discrimination in our schools.""

""If they don't tolerate it, why do they tolerate it in this case?"" Atty. Robert Sykes asked.

51,Mother’s Day a heartbreaking remembrance for a few at Naples Pier,"Not everyone looks toward the flowers and letters of Mother’s Day. While many people celebrate the holiday, some remember lives lost.

Holly Vingson leaned on the wooden rails of Naples Pier on Sunday. The green flowers clutched in her hand blew in the wind. A wave of emotion struck as she remembered a tragic day scarred in her mind.

Vingson’s son died almost six months ago. AJ Ruiz, 6, drowned in a pool at a birthday party.

“I turned my back for a second,” Vingson said. “It isn’t like the movies, with splashing and yelling. It’s silent. You don’t hear a thing.”

Tears fell as the flowers drifted toward the Gulf waters below. The first Mother’s Day without a child struck especially deep, Vingson said.

“I didn’t want to believe it,” she said. “They say the first two years are the worst, and it’s not even six months yet.”

Kelley Vingson’s flowers floated on the Gulf waters moments later. She stood beside her daughter on the Pier, grieving together over their terrible loss.

The two went to the Pier instead of a church service Sunday morning. Any Mother’s Day mentions would only hurt.

“I can’t go to a Mother’s Day service,” Holly Vingson said. “People are celebrating.”

A few bereaved women met at the Pier to remember their lost children together. A plastic cup of tea, flowers and stories of happy memories brought the women together.

“Grieving is like a fingerprint,” Holly Vingson said. “Everyone has one, but everyone is taking a different path.”

While Holly and Kelley Vingson grieve together, a few memories brought a smile. The two are raising money for a memorial at Palm Royale Cemetery — a place for family and friends to remember the young boy in peace, Kelley said.

“Even during his short time here, he touched so many,” she said.

The mother and daughter had lost a child, but they still had each other for a somber Mother’s Day celebration at home.

“It feels like (AJ is) just in the next room,” Kelley said. “I’m just not there yet.”

52,'Rainbow baby' wins Miss Okaloosa toddler division,"CRESTVIEW — When most people meet Karlee Copley, they see a sassy, blonde-headed little girl. For Karlee’s parents, Karisa and Jeremy, she is so much more.

Karlee is a rainbow baby, a name coined for a healthy baby born after a baby is lost because of miscarriage, infant loss, stillbirth or neonatal death.

Karisa and Jeremy lost their newborn son, Jace, 65 minutes after he was born to Edwards syndrome, a very rare chromosome defect.

“It was a dark time,"" Karisa said. “What got us through is family and leaning toward God. If we wouldn’t have put him first, we never would have made it.""

Karisa found out she was expecting a baby about a month after Jace’s passing.

“I was so excited,” Karisa said. “I was working at Asurion, and a friend of mine brought me a pregnancy test. We went to the Tom Thumb and it immediately showed I was pregnant.

“I didn’t care if it was a boy or a girl,” she added. “After I lost Jace, I wanted to try for one more.”

Ten months after the loss of their son, Karisa and Jeremy welcomed a healthy baby girl to the world. Karlee joined big brother Cole as part of the family.

“It was most definitely meant to happen,” Karisa said. “She filled the void. It was perfection; that’s the only way we can describe it.""

On April 28 a panel of judges agreed. Karlee, now 3 years old, won the toddler division of the Miss Okaloosa Pageant.

Karlee had been in two other pageants, but it was the first time she was crowned as the winner.

Karisa said she entered her daughter in the pageant because she is a diva.

“She likes to wear dresses and she likes to twirl,” Karisa said. “I knew that if I found the right dress and put her in it, she would twirl her life away, and that’s exactly what she did. She went out there and let go of my hand and she just twirled.""

When watching a video of her pageant, Karlee said, “That’s me wearing a blue dress and look at my crown right there. That’s where I win the pageant.”

Karisa said the first thing Karlee asked after winning was when she would be in the next pageant.

Karlee is very quick to tell people she loves pageants and her favorite food is “princess food.”

Karisa said watching her daughter grow gives her a lot of pride.

“This is more than I could ever imagine,” she said. “She’s perfect. She’s so smart, full of life, and outgoing.

“I have high hopes for her.”",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190512/rainbow-baby-wins-miss-okaloosa-toddler-division/1?rssfeed=true,2019-05-12T09:02:49Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

""But, I do know his health today, that it seems illegal for them to put the poison in him, when he's at this point in his condition,"" his father said.

The boy's parents initially refused to show up for treatments after two rounds of chemo.

Late last month, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office issued a missing endangered child alert after his parents failed to bring him to a hospital procedure.

The family was found in Kentucky.

People protested outside Johns Hopkins All Children's outpatient care facility in Tampa as the boy underwent the treatment.

""We're out here because it's medical freedom, you know. You should be able to make your own decisions,"" said Stacy Sharp.",http://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/hillsborough-county-boy-3-gets-chemo-treatment-after-parents-refused/1995022824,2019-05-10T20:13:53Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

62,2-year-old boy missing in southwest Detroit found safe,"- The 2-year-old boy who was reported missing in southwest Detroit early Friday morning has been found safe.

Aries Washington was found in a vacant lot, close to the home where he was last seen. We're told he was covered in a bunch of leaves and brush and apparently sheltered from the cold. He's been taken to the hospital as a precaution to be evaluated.

He went missing in the area of Yale and Melville Street, which is in a neighborhood near Zug Island. Police were seen there earlier this morning canvassing the streets with a tracking dog.

The boy's father told police they were walking from a McDonald's around midnight when it started pouring rain, so they sought shelter in the 8400 block of Melville under an awning outside a vacant home. They eventually fell asleep, and the father said when he woke up around 5:30 a.m. the boy wasn't around.

A neighbor told us she heard screaming right around the same time and wondered what was going on.

We're told the father is still with police for questioning.

This is a developing story. Stay with us for updates.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/u-s-and-world-news/2-year-old-boy-reported-missing-in-southwest-detroit,2019-05-10T14:48:16Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

64,Southwest Florida golf column: Naples woman makes two aces in four-hole span,"Naples' Kim Spreng made two holes-in-one in a four-hole span on April 26 on the Sabal Course at The Strand. (Photo: Submitted)

Kim Spreng and her husband Rick went out to play a quick nine holes on April 26 on The Sabal Course at The Club at The Strand.

Spreng had no idea how memorable that was going to turn out.

Neither did Kathy Beers when she played at two different courses within a week last month.

Spreng, 53. used a pitching wedge and made a hole-in-one on the 78-yard No. 5.

""The ball's in flight and Rick called and said 'It's going to be a hole-in-one' and I said 'No' and it went in,"" Spreng said. ""It was pretty cool.""

Three holes later, Spreng stepped up on the 80-yard No. 8 with her pitching wedge again.

""(Rick) was in the golf cart and he couldn't see the green, but he could see the flight of the ball, and he said 'Oh, another hole-in-one,'"" she said. ""I just shook my head yes. He said I don't see the ball, and I said 'No, it's in the cup.'

""It's pretty fun. He's still looking for his first.""

As he puts it, her husband has a ""hole-in-three."" He made a hole-in-one on a par 3 after hitting a ball out of bounds.

Spreng is now up to three. Her first was at her home club in Ashland, Ohio, a few years ago. The Sprengs have been coming to Southwest Florida since the late 1990s, bought a place in 2011, and are now retired.

""I played through high school and when I was working, I quite for a while and then started back up probably 15 years ago,"" Spreng said. ""I started playing more and since we retired a couple of years ago. When you live on a golf course, it makes it a lot easier to play more.""

Beers, 73, was playing in the Women's Gulf Coast Interclub tournament at Worthington Golf & Country Club in Bonita Springs on April 15.

""It was our second hole (No. 7), and it was a 119-yard par 3 up a hill and into the wind,"" Beers said. ""I hit it a 7-iron and it just kind of went over the ridge and we never saw it again.""

Beers almost had more excitement. No. 5, a par 3, was their final hole. She hit the flagstick and stopped a foot to the right of the hole.

Ellen Bonn, Mary Ann Rohloff, Mary Pendergast witnessed that one.

A week later, at almost the same time of day, Beers was at her home club, Highland Woods Golf & Country Club, and she came to No. 5, a 93-yard par 3.

""I hit a 9-iron and it just kept rolling around and went in the hole,"" she said. ""We saw that one. I've been playing golf for 50 years and bemoaning the fact that I've never had a hole-in-one.""

Shirley Wood, Marianne Patton, and Wendy Gardner witnessed that ace.

Beers' strong string has continued. On Sunday, her ball went over the edge of the hole on a par 3 and stopped a foot behind.

""All of a sudden, it's been working,"" said Beers, who will head back north to Oconomowoc Golf Club in Wisconsin.



Joe Fitori and Jim Fahey had a different twist on a unique golf feat.

While playing in the same group at Pelican Marsh, Fahey made a hole-in-one on No. 4 from 137 yards out with an 8-iron. Later in the round, Fitori made a double eagle on the 16th hole. Bob Call and John Weaver witnessed each.

65,"An explosive debate on racial bias marks Florida's move to arm teachers, over educators' objections","At issue was a request by Jones, who is black, that teachers who might soon wield guns in classrooms endeavor to acknowledge their own prejudices. The suggestion led a white Republican to claim that Jones was slandering teachers.

A lawmaker was moved to tears on the floor of the Florida House of Representatives on Tuesday in a dramatic confrontation over race and gun violence that convulsed Tallahassee.

The bitter partisan debate left Democratic lawmaker Shevrin Jones putting his Republican colleagues on notice, warning them, ""Don't dare call me a racist."" At issue was a request by Jones, who is black, that teachers who might soon wield guns in classrooms endeavor to acknowledge their own prejudices. The suggestion led a white Republican to claim that Jones was slandering teachers.

The bruising battle reached a climax on Wednesday as Republicans succeeded in advancing, on a virtually party-line vote, a bill allowing classroom teachers to carry firearms. The legislation, which cleared the state Senate last week, now goes to Gov. Ron DeSantis, R, for his signature. He is expected to approve.

The bill would expand the school guardian program developed in the wake of last year's shooting that left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

Last year's legislative package put guns in the hands of certain school employees, but not teachers. The new legislation would undo that exception, based on the determination by a commission investigating the February 2018 massacre that some of the bloodshed could have been prevented if more staff inside the building had been armed.

Numerous states already allow teachers to have guns in classrooms. The approach gained currency following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

Now, it's an idea backed by President Donald Trump, as well as by the National Rifle Association, which exercises vast influence in Tallahassee.

It is opposed, however, by educators statewide. Their objections were amplified on the House floor by Democrats, who also cited two incidents on Tuesday as proof that greater access to guns on campuses would be unwise. At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a gunman killed two students and injured four others. Earlier in the day, a gun went off in a school resource officer's holster in a middle school cafeteria in Wesley Chapel, Florida. No one was injured.

""We see accidents happening every day,"" said state Rep. Susan Valdes, D, a former school board member from Tampa. ""I must stand with the children who have asked me, 'Don't put more guns in our schools.' ""

Wary Democrats offered a raft of amendments to the House bill this week. The addition proposed by Jones would have required school faculty and staff members who choose to carry firearms to undergo implicit bias training.

""What happens when that teacher,"" Jones asked, ""feels threatened?""

Quick to the trigger, a teacher could then point to the state's ""Stand Your Ground"" defense, he reasoned. A student caught on the wrong end of a gun barrel would have no chance to respond.

The ""Stand Your Ground"" justification for the use of force became a flash point in 2012, when authorities in Sanford, Florida, said it was the reason they did not arrest George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, after he killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager.

To some, the suggestion that implicit bias operates in the classroom unfairly maligned teachers.

Rep. Toby Overdorf, R, said he took issue with hearing ""teachers called racist"" as well as with the suggestion that ""they can't understand the different colors of people.""

""I am just really disturbed as to where the depths of these arguments are going when you're questioning these people,"" he added, noting that it was also wrong to call teachers ""druggies.""

Democrats replied that they had leveled no such accusations.

""I didn't hear anybody call teachers racists,"" state Rep. Fentrice Driskell observed bluntly.

Jones had harsher words for his colleagues. When he rose to conclude debate on the amendment, he was seething with anger. At first, all he could do was murmur, ""Wow. Wow.""

Then he found the language to defend himself, explaining the rationale for his amendment.

""I asked for implicit bias training because we're talking about black boys and girls who are getting murdered by police officers,"" he said. ""There are bad police officers and there are bad teachers. I never called them racist, but I'm giving you reality.""

He claimed that the chamber's Republican leaders could not ""care less"" about the experiences that might cause his black constituents to fear an armed teacher. The amendment, he said, was intended for these marginalized groups, whose perspective he understood because of his own racial identity. Someone with a gun, he told them, might not ""look at me like they look at you.""

Similarly, he explained, his voice breaking, a teacher might ""look at that boy who has dreads in his hair and might be intimidated by him.""

""I fight for the people I fight for,"" Jones concluded. ""Don't insult me for fighting for the people I serve.""

The amendment failed, as did every one of the Democratic proposals.

The bill ultimately advanced 65 to 47, with a handful of Republicans joining a united Democratic caucus in dissent.

When the vote was tallied, Jones was not present in the chamber. He had been rushed to the hospital Wednesday morning, later released with a diagnosis of vertigo.

""Following the emotional debate yesterday, I am deeply disappointed to have missed today's vote,"" he said in a news release. ""As I've reiterated time and again, teachers should not be responsible for carrying weapons and patrolling the campuses of students they are tasked with educating.""

The legislation includes a number of other components that boast bipartisan support, including new safety protocols and record-keeping requirements.

But allowing classrooms teachers to carry guns - following screening and instruction from local sheriffs - is deeply divisive.

Among the idea's critics are survivors of the shooting last year in Parkland. Emma González called the idea ""stupid"" in a ""60 Minutes"" interview last year. Her classmate David Hogg said it would put students in danger and boost gun sales, ""promoting the NRA's deadly agenda.""

Republican lawmakers defended the expansion of the guardian program by arguing that it merely creates a ""pathway"" for teachers to arm themselves, as state Rep. Dane Eagle said on the House floor on Wednesday. He stressed that the solution was ""not a mandate.""

Still, educators oppose the move. Fedrick Ingram, president of the Florida Education Association, said putting guns in classrooms was the ""wrong conversation.""

Several school boards have preemptively voted to bar teachers from carrying guns. And Florida voters oppose allowing trained teachers to arm themselves, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released in March.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190502/explosive-debate-on-racial-bias-marks-floridas-move-to-arm-teachers-over-educators-objections?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T15:20:00Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401

There's no question Michael Jackson was the king of pop in the 1980s, and Madonna wasn't far behind. But if there's a Mount Rushmore of rockers from that era, Bryan Adams certainly deserves consideration.

The Canadian songwriter and musician — with his first major hit ""Cuts Like A Knife"" — performs May 6 in Jacksonville, May 7 in St. Petersburg and May 10 at the Wharf Amphitheater in Orange Beach, Alabama, near Pensacola with tickets for as little as about $20.

Adams charted other mega-hits, including ""Summer of '69,"" ""This Time"" from his debut 1983 album, ""Cuts Like A Knife"" and ""Run To You"" from the 1984 album ""Reckless.""

Plan ahead

Rob Thomas

Rob Thomas is known as the front-man for Matchbox 20, but perhaps his greatest claim to fame was singing on Santana's wildly successful song ""Smooth"" that he co-wrote.

It won three Grammys in 2000, including Song of the Year and as last year Billboard considered the second most successful song of all time after Chubby Checker's 1960 hit ""The Twist.""

Thomas and his ""Chip Tooth Tour"" into the Sunshine State this summer, with concerts set for July 2 at Mizner Park in Boca Raton; July 3 at Hard Rock Live Orlando; July 5 at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg; and July 6 at Daily's Place in Jacksonville.

His Matchbox 20 hits have remained pop music staples in recent years, including ""Real World,""""3AM"" and ""Push.""

Brian Regan (Photo: Brian Friedman)

Brian Regan

Jerry Seinfeld has called him one of his favorite comedians, and Brian Regan has earned his stature among standup legends.

The South Florida native tours it seems constantly, and returns to Florida with shows July 26 at Barbara B. Mann Hall in Fort Myers with tickets around $50 each.

The next night, Regan is at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg and tickets start around $40.

Regan is known for his clean comedy, with popular skits including ""Say Eight"" and ""Doughnut Lady.""

He still prides himself on being able to walk in public pretty much anonymously; a few years ago in an interview with the Naples Daily News, Regan discussed how he and his children had just spent a day at Disney World in Orlando and he went unrecognized.

76,Prosecutor: Dogs detected decomposition in Houston missing girl case,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Photos: Houston Police)

HOUSTON (AP) — Trained dogs detected the scent of human decomposition in the vehicle of a man arrested in connection with the disappearance of a 4-year-old Texas girl, according to a prosecutor.

Derion Vence, 26, remained jailed Sunday on a $1 million bond after being arrested a day earlier on a charge of tampering evidence, specifically a human corpse. His next court appearance is set for Monday.

Houston police said investigators have not found Maleah Davis and the investigation is continuing. Authorities have declined to say whether they believe Vence killed Maleah. But prosecutors said in court documents filed Saturday that Vence could face additional charges, including murder.

The investigation began after Vence told police that men in a truck on May 4 had abducted him, Maleah and his 2-year-old son a day earlier, but had freed him and the boy. Vence told investigators he was left in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land and walked to a hospital, where he reported the girl's abduction.

Sugar Land police, who initially interviewed him, said his story kept changing and didn't add up.

Vence, who had lived with Maleah and her mother, reported that his silver Nissan Altima was taken in the abduction, but surveillance video showed that vehicle was used to drop Vence off at the hospital. Police found the car Thursday.

Dogs trained to find cadavers reacted to the trunk of the car, Pat Stayton, a prosecutor with the Harris County District Attorney's Office, said at Vence's probable cause court hearing Saturday night.

Surveillance video from a neighbor showed Vence carrying a large, blue laundry basket with a large trash bag from his apartment on May 3, Stayton said. Vence returned three minutes later without the basket and later he was seen leaving the apartment with cleaning supplies, including bleach.

In the silver Nissan, police found a laundry basket that looked like the one Vence took out of his apartment, Stayton said.

""Both of the dogs reacted to the trunk of the silver Nissan that the defendant had driven and that the blue laundry basket was recovered from, indicating that the dogs were responding to the scent of human decomposition in the vehicle,"" Stayton said.

Investigators also found blood at the apartment, both in the hallway leading to the bathroom and on surfaces inside the bathroom, Stayton said.

At Saturday night's hearing, Vence said he planned to hire a defense attorney.

Rodney Brown, an attorney appointed to represent Vence only for Saturday's hearing, had asked a magistrate judge to set bond at $5,000, saying Vence was a low flight risk and had lived in Houston most of his life.

Stayton argued that Vence was a flight risk and there was ""evidence of deception on the part of the defendant with regard to information he gave to police.""

Police have described Vence as Maleah's stepfather, but Maleah's mother, Brittany Bowens, said through a spokesman that Vence is her former fiance. Quanell X, a local civil rights activist who spoke to reporters on Bowens' behalf on Friday, also said that Vence had abused Maleah.

Child Protective Services removed Maleah and her brothers from the home Vence and Bowens shared in August after the girl suffered a head wound, but the children were returned in February, according to an agency spokeswoman.",https://www.wfla.com/national/prosecutor-dogs-detected-decomposition-in-houston-missing-girl-case/1997828304,2019-05-12T18:21:16Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

HOUSTON (AP) — Houston police say they found “blood evidence” in the apartment of Darion Vence that matches that of the missing 4-year-old girl, Maleah Davis.

In a statement on the arrest of Vence, Houston police say that he has been charged with tampering with evidence.

They also say that Vence was observed carrying a full laundry basket from the apartment.

The laundry basket was found in the trunk of Vence’s silver Nisson Altima, which was recovered in Missouri City, Texas, Thursday.

Vence reported last Saturday that Maleah had been abducted from him.

80,Man who reported girl missing arrested in her disappearance,"HOUSTON - The man who reported a 4-year-old Texas girl had been abducted from him last weekend was arrested near Houston Saturday and police say they have found blood in his apartment linked to the girl.



Darion Vence was arrested without incident at his brother's home in Sugar Land, Texas, about 22 miles (35 kilometers) southwest of Houston, a statement from Houston police said. He was charged with tampering with evidence.



Vence told police last Saturday that men in a pickup truck abducted him, 4-year-old Maleah Davis and his 2-year-old son before freeing him and the boy. But Sugar Land police, who initially interviewed him, said his story kept changing and didn't add up.

""Blood evidence obtained from Vence's apartment has been linked to Maleah,"" the Houston police statement said.



Vence also was observed carrying a full laundry basket from the apartment, police said. That basket was later found in the trunk of the Nissan along with a gas can.



Maleah's mother Brittany Bowens, said Vence is her former fiance. Bowens appeared outside her apartment Friday as Quanell X, a local civil rights activist, addressed reporters on her behalf.



Quanell X said that Vence had abused Maleah and that Bowens believes Vence harmed the girl.



Vence and Bowens were recently in a fight and she broke off their engagement, Quanell X said.



Child Protective Services removed Maleah and her brothers from the home Vence and Bowens shared in August after the girl suffered a head wound, but the children were returned in February, according to an agency spokeswoman.

85,Father of 2-year-old with brain tumor to speak at UF Brain Tumor Education Day,"Buy Photo James Horton, 2, at his parents' Tallahassee home Thursday, May 9, 2019. (Photo: Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat)

Two-year-old James Horton loves to sing along as his mom plays the piano, play outside with his brother and sister and sit in his dad's backpack harness when the family goes hiking.

The bright little boy, inquisitive and playful, was diagnosed with a brain tumor when he was just three months old.

This Saturday, his dad, Wiley Horton, a local intellectual property attorney, will speak at University of Florida's Brain Tumor Education Day, where patients and loved ones can learn about treatments and research related to the disease. He will share his family's story.

When James was about 5 weeks old, his mom Eva Horton noticed his bright green eyes were wobbling. The condition, called nystagmus, led a neurologist to call for an MRI. A first scan showed swelling in the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain.

After a second MRI at UF Health Shands Hospital, little James was diagnosed with an optic pathway glioma, a slow-growing tumor involving the glial cells in the brain.

Buy Photo Eva and Wiley Horton with their children James, 2, left, Charlie, 4 and Eliza, 6 at their Tallahassee home Thursday, May 9, 2019. (Photo: Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat)

""I didn't know what a glioma was and I didn't know what the prognosis was,"" said Wiley. ""We prayed, is what we did.""

He and Eva felt relief after meeting with a Shands pediatric brain tumor specialist.

""He said, 'The first thing you need to know is this threatens his vision, not his life,'"" Wiley said.

James has shown some hesitation with depth perception, Eva explained. But since he's so young, testing the impact the tumor has had on his vision is difficult, Wiley added.

Located at the base of the cerebrum, the tumor is inoperable, Wiley said. But after different chemotherapy trials, James has been responding well to his latest immunotherapy treatment, Avastin, which helps his immune system fight the cancer.

Since starting it seven weeks ago, James' parents said he has been vocalizing observations, like naming his nurse from down the hall at the hospital, or pointing out the yellow school bus as they're driving.

""That's something to celebrate ... You want the best for your baby, you know— and it just makes me think it’s possible. I think he’s improving and I think it's this new drug,"" Eva said. ""I think he's been seeing a lot better in the past couple weeks.""

Wiley said James has tolerated the chemo and therapy very well.

""We just had a scan last Friday that showed it's really being quite effective,"" he said. ""The cancer is becoming much less active and the Avastin is doing what it's hoped to do.""

For the next one and a half to two years, James and his family will commute to Shands every other week for treatment sessions — a ""walk in the park"" compared to previous treatments, which required the family to make the 150-mile drive weekly.

James loves sliding on couch cushions across the floor with his siblings in a makeshift game of bumper cars, strumming on his dad's guitar and telling knock-knock jokes. But he even enjoys his hospital visits, riding the elevators and interacting with nurses. The little boy doesn't flinch when he gets his finger pricked.

The family is optimistic and grateful about the new treatment.

“It’s just kind of overwhelming."" Eva said. ""But from the beginning … we’ve been surrounded … by people who their kids are facing so much worse.""

Police said the Tucson's driver was cited for failing to yield the right of way.

93,Accused Colorado school shooter identifies as 'devonkillz' on Snapchat,"Federal authorities believe 18-year-old Devon Erickson and 17-year-old Alec McKinney, a transgender boy born Maya McKinney, planned the Tuesday school shooting in Colorado together.

On Wednesday afternoon, Erickson, whose name on Snapchat was ""devonkillz,"" appeared in court to face charges in the attack at STEM School Highlands Ranch that left 18-year-old Kendrick Castillo dead.

Erickson kept his head lowered, as his defense attorneys asked the judge to allow them to see the crime scene. His long hair covered his face during most of the hearing. The aspiring actor and musician's hair had shades of fuchsia, purple and orange. He wore dark nail polish.

His friend Aiden Beatty told The Denver Post on Wednesday that Erickson had told him a few weeks ago he had broken up with his girlfriend. His 56-year-old mother, Stephanie Erickson, told The New York Post she didn't know why he had committed the atrocity.

Devon Erickson, 18, and 17-year-old Alec McKinney, a transgender boy born Maya McKinney, are facing charges in school shooting in Colorado.

Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said the suspects used at least two handguns. ABC News' Denver affiliate reported some of the weapons were stolen from Erickson's parents. Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are investigating.

Douglas County prosecutors charged Erickson with one count of first-degree murder and 29 counts of first-degree attempted murder. He is being held without bond. He is set to appear in court again at 1:30 p.m. Friday.

A trooper saw the stolen 2019 Ford Taurus on State Road 44 and attempted to pull the vehicle over, but the teen driver fled through a parking lot and then back onto SR 44 before losing control near State Road 19, the crash report said.

The front of the car struck a Sprint store on Burleigh Boulevard, according to authorities. Photos provided by the Tavares Fire Department show damage to the corner of the building and the car with what appears to be a cinder-block column on top of it coming to a final rest against a fence it crashed into.

Firefighters said two teenagers were flown to a trauma center after the crash, while the two others suffered minor injuries.

Troopers said a 15-year-old boy fled on foot and was later arrested. A gun was found in another 15-year-old boy's pocket, according to the report.

Charges are pending against all four teenage boys.

95,Parents of 2-year-old who drowned in pond file wrongful death lawsuit,"Image of Franklin Parker provided by Law Offices of Anidjar & Levin on a retention pond photo provided by The Baker County Press

MACCLENNY, Fla. - The parents of a 2-year-old boy who drowned in a Baker County retention pond in April believe his death was preventable and are suing the owner of the property, claiming he didn't install fencing that might have protected their son.

Franklin Parker was found in the pond April 23 after he wandered away from the apartment where he was being watched by his 18-year-old sister while their parents were at work. A neighbor tried to revive the little boy with CPR, but he died at Ed Fraser Memorial Hospital in Macclenny.

A release from the attorneys now representing Franklin's parents said the boy died days before his third birthday.

According to the Law Offices of Anidjar & Levine, the retention pond is located on the property of Macclenny Cycle & Marine, owned by Stephen Clarence Williams Jr. According to court documents, the property owner did not have proper fencing as required by building permits, the attorneys claim.

""This tragedy was preventable,"" said defense attorney Glen Levine. ""Our clients are devastated, and we are working hard to ensure that those at fault take responsibility.""

Williams applied Jan. 13 to the St. Johns River Water Management District for a permit for the construction of the retention pond to be used for stormwater treatment, court documents show. Plans submitted to the district detailed the construction of a 6-foot fence with a self-latching gate. A permit for construction was issued two weeks later on Jan. 27.

Williams subsequently constructed the retention pond, which was completed in March 2017. However, the property owner failed to install the fence as detailed in the construction plans, the attorneys said.

The owner told News4Jax shortly after the boy's death that a fence is planned around the pond but it hasn't been built yet.

In a wrongful death lawsuit, Franklin's family alleges the corporation constructed the pond with an unreasonably dangerous slope and failed to provide signage warning of the pond's depth. They also allege the property owner knew or should have known the risk that the unfenced pond posed to the public's health and safety and that failure to comply with the building permit resulted in the toddler's death.

In 2000, a Florida family won a settlement against property owners for the wrongful death of their toddler who drowned in a retention pool that also lacked adequate fencing, the attorneys pointed out.

96,Lehigh Acres man charged in 2018 crash that killed 5-year-old Fort Myers boy,"CLOSE It was a dangerous year on Lee and Collier roads in 2018. Megan Kearney, mkearney@news-press.com

A Lehigh Acres man is facing charges of causing a death while driving without a valid license in a fatal November 2018 crash on Gunnery Road.

Mitchell Buenrostro, 18, remains in Lee County Jail on no bond. He will be arraigned June 20.

A Florida Highway Patrol report said Connor Green, 5, of Fort Myers, was killed in the two-vehicle crash in Lehigh Acres.

The crash happened when Buenrostro, 17 at the time, was driving a 2003 Dodge 1500 pickup westbound on Sunset Road, near the intersection of Gunnery Road.

Buenrostro ran a stop sign at Gunnery, the FHP said, and hit the right side of a 2015 Nissan Quest being driven north on Gunnery by Ashley Green, 33, of Fort Myers.

The impact forced the truck that Buenrostro was driving off the road to the right and it overturned. Green's vehicle traveled off the roadway to the left and struck a ditch.

Connor Green was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash, the FHP said. Ashley Green and a passenger in the Nissan suffered minor injuries. Buenrostro and three teen passengers in the truck also suffered minor injuries.

97,"Lonely 6-year-old's 911 call becomes teachable moment, bond with Tallahassee police officer","A 911 call from a lonely 6-year-old boy could have ended with stern discipline instead of a stuffed animal and perhaps a budding friendship.

The boy, who's name hasn't been released, said his mom was ""mean"" and made him cry, according to the 911 call. The dispatcher stayed on the line and asked him several questions, including his age, address and where were his parents, who were unaware their son called 911.

Tallahassee Police Officer Joe White was en route when the boy called a few more times to make sure an officer was coming. Once he arrived, the boy asked if he and White could be friends.

The Tallahassee Police Department posted on Facebook pictures of White and the boy holding a stuffed animal given by White. The officer informed the boy of when to use 911.

TPD spokesman Damon Miller told the Tallahassee Democrat the social media post was made by another public information officer so he couldn't confirm whether White made contact with the boy's parents before the post was made public.

Steve Harrelson, director of the Consolidated Dispatch Agency, said it's rare that a child calls 911 because they're lonely.

Here’s Officer Joe White's his new friend, who called 911 because he was lonely. (Photo: Tallahassee Police Department)

""Realizing he was a child, we put some extra attention to that,"" said Harrelson, who urged parents to teach their children about 911. ""It was a great conclusion to an incident that could have been a lot worse. (White) used that moment to educate the uses of 911 ... It worked all the way around for everyone.""

Miller said White did what most officers do every day, but most people don't know about. He said it's not unusual for officers to have similar encounters with children.

""He let the young man know that they can be his friend and how to use the 911,"" Miller said. ""This is a classic example that we are humans as well, and we are not robots.""

TALLAHASEE, Fla. (WFLA) – An upset, lonely 6-year-old boy called 911 in Tallahassee on Tuesday looking for a friend.

Officer Joe White responded to the 911 call and the little boy asked if the officer would be his friend.

Officer White explained how 911 worked and was for emergencies.

More importantly, according to a Facebook post by the Tallahassee Police Department, the officer told the boy he’d be happy to be a friend.

The little boy got to sit in the police vehicle, was given a new stuffed animal and now has a friend at the Tallahassee Police Department.

Throughout history, mothers have been the major impact on their children’s lives; mostly good but sometimes, not so good. I am lucky that all my mother figures were a major positive impact on my life. To honor them, I would like to share my letters to them.

My maternal grandmother

Dear Peggy,

I would not be the same without you. My earliest memories where numerous long-distance telephone conversations from you in Rochester, New York. You often visited us in Florida; here you loved taking us on adventures. You introduced us to the simple pleasures of exploring our surroundings with train rides across Central Florida. Or city bus rides all around Lakeland. This set the foundation for the wanderlust that rule my life today. You taught me the meaning of unconditional love.

When you aged, you moved to our town. Here you embraced my new wife and all our children. I fondly remember when you would call and insist that I come visit. Upon arriving you would announce “I am going to win the $20 Million dollars in the Magazine Sweepstakes; I need your help filling out the entry forms!” It was another way of when you just wanted to spend time together.

One of your greatest gifts was your sense of humor. A great example is when you called my wife Morgan and said, “How would you like to be a widow?” Morgan was left speechless. Then you went on to say, “if you do not immediately send Gregg to my house to fill out the Magazine sweepstakes form, you might become a widow.” Or, when I traveled out of town and you talked my wife into dyeing her hair purple. What grandmother does that?

It was sad when I sat hours with you when you were drifting towards death with pneumonia at the age of 93. Here we shared our last words. At least we got to hold hands and express our love. This love has never ceased, I still love you as much as ever.

My mother

Dear Janet,

(Note) My wife thinks it is very weird that my brother and I were brought up to call our parents by their first name.

When I strayed way off my path while in high school you tolerated my poor judgment and made it clear that you believed in me. I now understand your tactics when you allowed all my friend to hang out at our house. Here you could keep an eye on us and stay connected with our crowd. When I finally managed to graduate from high school, you were the voice that pushed me to continue my education. Boy was I surprised to learn if you show up for class and complete your homework, you can earn good grades.

You were also a good friend. We loved it when you and Dad made regular visits to Tallahassee. You were not only acting as parents, but you were good friends coming to watch football games or constantly celebrating anything imaginable. I would not be in a good place without having you as my guiding light and pushing me to succeed in life.

You died too early from lung cancer at the age of 63. When we received the unexpected call that you were very ill, we rushed down to Winter Haven, my father met up at the entrance of the hospital in shock. He was saying ""she’s gone."" Rushing upstairs to say goodbye to you was very tough. In addition to the emotions of losing a parent, this is when my own mortality set in.

I still carry many of the lessons you taught me. One of my guiding principles from you is, “When someone is being difficult, overload them with kindness.” This really works! I am a very lucky guy that “you” are my mother.

Dottie – my bonus Mom

Dear Dottie,

Thank you for stepping in and taking care of my father a few years after my mother passed. You immediately embraced our family as if it was your own. I am glad you and my Dad had a great time together. Every time we would talk on the phone, you would enthusiastically ask about everyone. When we would travel, you would follow every step of our journey, like a proud parent.

Dottie, I miss your annual pilgrimages to our family Thanksgiving Dinners. I never thought that while in my 50s and 60s that I would be so lucky to have someone treat me with unconditional love just like a maternal mother. We lost you last year, but I will always carry you in my heart. Thank you for being in my life.

Writing these letters to my Mother’s has rekindled and strengthened my memories of these fabulous women.

So, I urge you to get outside and go for a walk. Go solo, or bring a family member or friend. Talk and share stories about your mother (or mother figure). Then, go home and write her a letter. It will warm your heart.

Are you in?

101,"After regular Baker Act committals, program helps teen","NAPLES — Caleb Caldwell's delicate peace with himself wavered earlier this year when a violent outburst nearly led to a mental health evaluation under Florida's Baker Act — yet again.

The 19-year-old from Naples had skipped some of the medications he takes to treat symptoms of his bipolar disorder and got into an argument with his mother and brother.

""He was being very violent. And he did put his hands on me,"" said his mother, Mellisa Caldwell. ""He just gets really out of hand. He does. And he's a big guy.""

But given the troubles of Caleb's life, the fact this lapse was not worse is something of a victory.

Caleb, an otherwise soft-spoken young man who finally landed a paying job and hopes to work in sports medicine, spent most of his early and mid-adolescence in and out of mental health crisis units.

It was before his condition had been fully diagnosed, and his prescribed medication was wanting.

He was bullied. He had violent outbursts at home and at school. He regularly threatened suicide. And at one point, he was getting committed under the Baker Act nearly every other week.

The boy's troubling behavior, his later mood swings and propensity to violence — seemingly without remorse — even prompted one psychiatrist to tell the Naples family that the boy had ""sociopathic criminal potential.""

So much happened, and so much of it seems like a blur to Caleb.

""A lot of this has been going on for so long that I don't remember a lot,"" Caleb said.

Then, when he was 16, after one of his threats to kill himself and another Baker Act evaluation at the David Lawrence Center in East Naples, real progress: a new diagnosis and treatment plan that seemed to better address his behavior problems.

It turns out that Caleb, now 19, was on the autism spectrum, something multiple mental health professionals he encountered failed to notice, according to his family. He got different medications and found a mental health counselor who is helping him control his impulses.

He soon got an internship with the NCH Baker Downtown Hospital as part of the Project SEARCH program, which helps find jobs for teens and young adults with developmental disabilities.

Before his last behavioral lapse — the first serious one in years — Caleb said he hoped those days were behind him.

""There are times when I have some issues, but it doesn't get to that point anymore,"" he said.

But the family knows there will never be a treatment silver bullet. Caleb's problems will never just go away.

They consider themselves lucky because of the help from the David Lawrence Center and that they have the means to aggressively work to find him treatment. But they worry about Caleb's future.

He is transitioning into the working world. He still lives with his parents, but if he is committed under the Baker Act again, now as an adult, law enforcement officers would not be required to contact them.

Mellisa Caldwell is trying to establish legal guardianship of him into adulthood. Caleb isn't quite sure what he thinks about that.

""I feel like there are times that I need it,"" he said. ""But I think there are times when I need my own space and think I'm fine on my own. But I do think there are times — like when I get Baker Acted - what would I have done if she wasn't there?""",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190511/after-regular-baker-act-committals-program-helps-teen?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T16:26:25Z,News Chief,Couple,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881
103,This one's for all the ladies with a Simply Southern T-shirt in their closet,"Clothing companies spend fortunes capitalizing on the South to incorporate it into their brand identities. For instance, since Reese Witherspoon introduced her Draper James brand into the fashion world, she sells the wazoo out of upscale Southern charm and personality. Then, Allen Stephenson's Southern Tide line of men's wear reflects a sense of refined leisure with a Southern frat boy image. Based on general prices in both lines, it's not cheap dressing like us.

These brands were built by Southerners for Southerners and those who want to look like Southerners. There's a whole 'nother selling of the South going on out there, and that's the one we're discussing today.

Most of you women blessed enough to live here have at least one T-shirt declaring your love for the South or a favorite thing in the South. Mine is a blue, long-sleeved T-shirt by Simply Southern with a great picture of a Duke's Mayonnaise jar on the back. I've actually written a column about this condiment, and my shirt inspired it.

Bats vs. mosquitoes: Zapping mosquitoes with … bats? It could work

Summer safety: Can a hot bottle of water set a car on fire? It's rare, but yes

More dessert please: Why do Southerners go bananas for banana pudding?

That brand also doubles down on the kitsch by slapping farm animals and cute quotes across our chests. Kitsch is design generally considered garish, often due to being too sentimental. Seriously, though, how can we not be sentimental about our land, people and culture? We love them all, and isn't that enough to justify wearing those references for everyone to enjoy?

I see the Simply Southern and Southern Couture lines of T-shirts on women all over the South. I can't imagine that women who aren't residents of the South or at least natives being interested in these shirts, so I feel safe in assuming the lines are supported by Southern dollars.

I've wondered about exploitation, but then I think again. Why? We're the ones buying those designs. Our women are the ones sporting pictures of alligators saying, ""Careful-I Snap!"" and text-only,""Kill 'em With Kindness."" I'm the one who would buy Southern Couture's T-shirt showing a mermaid with the words, ""Gotta Get My Tail to the Beach"" if I found it.

Who doesn't have at least one Simply Southern T-shirt in their closet? (Photo: Brad Harper / Advertiser)

Don't think I haven't considered the irony of me talking about exploiting the South when I write about it every week and get paid for it, too. Some might think it approaches hypocrisy even. But it doesn't, because it isn't.

Any product for sale is driven by demand for it. We love, love, love making connections with other people by showing pride in our place. Here, the South is an independent identity who lives in all of us born within her borders. In fact, we probably need more merchants catering to her. There's so much to say and only so many shirts.

104,"Woman sues roofing company, claims house damaged when left unprotected during hurricane","Advertisement Woman sues roofing company, claims house damaged when left unprotected during hurricane Carrie Volpe wants $324,000 from Alliance Group Contracting Share Shares Copy Link Copy

A Palm Bay woman is suing the contractor she said she paid $20,000 for a roof repair she never got.Carrie Volpe said Alliance Group Contracting caused more damage to her house than she started with.She and her husband Joe ended up selling the house and taking the contractor to court.Other customers have lodged complaints against the company, too, according to the Florida Attorney General’s Office and the Better Business Bureau. “We thought we were going to have our dream house, our 5 acres, our country estate and we didn't. Not after they were done with it,” said Volpe.While living in Palm Bay in 2017, Volpe and her husband bought a Vero Beach house 30 miles away, believing it was worth renovating despite a previous fire in the attic that had destroyed some roof trusses.“We started fixing it up to renovate it because it was going to be the most beautiful house ever,” said Volpe.To fix the trusses and replace the tiles afterward, Volpe hired Alliance Contracting Group in Port St. Lucie, owned by Adam Ryckman.Volpe paid $20,000 down on March 25, 2017, so the work could begin. But she said despite repeated emails, calls and promises, all Alliance did in the next six months was remove some roof tiles -- breaking them in the process -- just in time for Hurricane Irma to roar through in August.“They left the roof exposed during Hurricane Irma so it just poured inside the house during the hurricane,” said Volpe. “And they left the windows open so the whole house got completely flooded. It caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages.”Ryckman told WPBF 25 News that wasn't true.“We took tiles off the roof to start our job and then she canceled the contract. The tiles are cosmetic, they're not water-tight. So you can take tiles off a house and it won't leak,” he said.Volpe said Alliance did finally put a tarp on the house weeks later, but then it was too late -- she says mold was setting in, attic wood was warping and the expenses were mounting.She filed a civil lawsuit against Ryckman asking for $324,000 in damages.“They took all of our money, then destroyed the inside of our house and then walked away,” Volpe said.And its not just a civil case arising out of this dispute -- Ryckman is facing a felony criminal charge stemming from the case.He’s charged with using his notary stamp on a notice of commencement that Volpe said she never signed nor saw.Volpe said she originally signed a notice of commencement with the company’s salesman on March 25, 2017, who notarized her signature.But when she went to the city to review her permit and file, she discovered a different notice of commencement, stamped by Ryckman.She claims he forged her signature on that document.In an interview with Port St. Lucie police before he was arrested last year, on suspicion of being responsible for the false signature and notarization, Ryckman told a detective he stamped the notice in his office.At that point, he already had been investigated by the state and found to been in violation of Florida's notary laws. The state required him to complete remedial action. Ryckman told police he had to retake the notary course.But he said he was just doing his customer a favor – saying Volpe signed two notices of commencement, one expired, and so to speed up the process, he notarized the other one.“Did you forge her signature?” the detective asked.“No,” Ryckman answered. Ryckman told police Volpe was just trying to get money out of him by making false allegations. He said she canceled the contract and went after him when she realized the original fire damage was so extensive, she'd have to replace her whole roof.“When she realized she'd have to pay more money she didn't want to do that and figured out a way for us to pay for it,” Ryckman said.Ryckman’s lawyer said they were still investigating the criminal case against him and had no comment at this time. “I think he should get his license taken away so he never does this to anyone else,” Volpe said.The Better Business Bureau offers these tips if you are considering hiring a roofing contractor:* Make sure you understand the full scope of the project. What exactly is the roofer going to do? Make sure you understand the pros and cons of the solutions and that everything is detailed in your contract.* Plan for bad weather. What happens if there is bad weather while your roof project is underway? Ask your roofer about what they will do to protect your home in the case of rain or storms.* Check your insurance coverage. If your project is for fixing damage, check your homeowner's insurance to see if your project is covered and how you should proceed if it is. * There are different contractors for different roofing systems. Roofing contractors may be certified to install specific types of roofs. You can check with the manufacturer to see if your contractor is certified for their system.For more information, you can visit the BBB website: https://www.bbb.org/article/tips/14082-bbb-tip-roofing-contractors>.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/woman-sues-roofing-company-claims-house-damaged-when-left-unprotected-during-hurricane/27439134,2019-05-11T02:52:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

106,Mom of Maleah Davis makes shocking allegations against ex-fiance,"- Four-year-old Maleah Davis has been missing for a week and now community activist Quanell X is speaking out with Maleah's mom, Brittany Bowens.

At a press conference Friday, they threw several allegations at Darion Vence, Maleah's stepfather and Bowen's ex-fiance.

Vence, who is a person of interest in Maleah's disappearance, told police that he, Maleah and his 1-year-old son were abducted by three men. Vence and the boy were released, but Maleah remains missing.

MORE: Stepfather is a person of interest in Maleah Davis' disappearance

Police have not heard from Vence since he first reported the alleged abduction.

Amber Alert Update: Houston police tell me Darion Vence is a person of interest in his stepdaughter Maleah’s disappearance. Sugar Land police tell me he changed his story, first saying he walked to the hospital, then saying someone dropped him off. https://t.co/YcS3luozmZ — Ivory Hecker FOX 26 (@IvoryHecker) May 7, 2019

Quanell X and Bowens allege that they have security footage from a neighboring apartment that shows Vence walking in and out of their apartment with multiple bottles of bleach. Later, he's said to be seen walking out with a garbage bag stuffed into a laundy hamper.

Bowens said that he told her he was cleaning the apartment. This would have been during the time that Bowens was out of town.

The footage is said to be in the hands of law enforcment to aid in their investigation.

Quanell also claims Vence had a history of violence against Maleah, that included spankings and beatings.

MORE: Maleah had been removed from home in August, returned from CPS custody

Bowens thinks Vence may have snapped because they got into a fight after she says she caught him sending explicit pictures to another man. She confronted him about being gay and then broke things off with him.

This comes just a day after police discovered the car that was stolen from the family in a Missouri City parking lot.

Little Maleah has been missing for a week.

107,Mother charged after throwing baby in dumpster in West Boca Raton; Deputies,"Update:



Deputies have charged Rafaelle Sousa with cruelty towards a child and attempted felony murder after they say she abandoned her newborn baby.

In her interview, police say Rafaelle admitted to delivering the baby, placing her in a bag and throwing her in a dumpster.

She is set to appear in court this morning.

CBS12 News will continue to follow this story





Detectives say the woman who they called a person of interest has been charged and booked into the Palm Beach County Jail.

Palm Beach County deputies confirm that she's the mother of the newborn baby found inside a dumpster at the Alister Apartments on Boca Entrada Boulevard.

Maria Saenz lives next door to the mother of the newborn and says she never knew she was expecting.

""She was really slim,"" she said. ""We never thought she was pregnant, maybe because she didn't have that much of a belly.""

The mother was transported to West Boca Medical Center and examined by doctors. Saenz says the woman is originally from Brazil, in her mid-30s, married and is the mother of a 3-year-old boy.

""He's a very happy little boy,"" Saenz said. ""I would always say hi to him and he always had a big smile.""

108,"Men accused of stealing cars, fleeing arrest face judge","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - A man accused of stealing two vehicles and speeding through multiple counties as authorities tracked his movements by air was ordered to be held without bond during a court appearance Thursday morning.

Orange County deputies said Wednesday's incident began when they saw a stolen truck in the area of East Colonial Drive and Avalon Park Boulevard. As authorities followed the vehicle without their lights activated, the occupants parked the truck and got into a white Dodge Charger.

Jacob Scott, 22, was driving the stolen Charger with passengers 19-year-old Roil Cambio and a 13-year-old boy inside on Wednesday, according to the affidavit.

Sky 6 video from the incident showed the Charger speeding on State Road 520 as authorities tracked it by air.

Records show Scott bailed out of the Charger on Wednesday and hopped onto a stolen motorcycle. The two other suspects fled on foot but were eventually caught, according to authorities.

Deputies said Scott was arrested at about 11:40 a.m. in the 16300 block of East Colonial Drive, where he abandoned the motorcycle.

Scott and Cambio are both facing multiple charges of grand theft. Cambio's bond was set at $11,450 on Thursday.

Court records show Scott has gone to jail at least three times since January.

The 13-year-old suspect is expected to face a judge at the Juvenile Justice Center on Thursday afternoon.

111,Hillsborough toddler will get court ordered chemo treatment today,"SAINT PETERSBURG, Fla. - TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - The decision is in when it comes to a Tampa toddler receiving chemotherapy treatment while he battles leukemia.

A Hillsborough County judge ruled that 3-year-old Noah McAdams must undergo chemo as he continues to fight a recent cancer diagnosis.

The child's parents were hoping for a more organic approach to treatment, one that includes medical-grade cannabis, vitamins and a strict diet.

While the judge ruled that alternative treatments are permissible, the primary course of action, she said, must include chemotherapy within the next 28 days.

As Noah's parents left the courthouse in downtown Tampa after Wednedsay's ruling, they described the judge's decision as, ""disappointing.""

The toddler's mother, Taylor Bland-Ball, told WFLA, ""I feel like it's definitely increased my fight, my strength and ultimately, my forgiveness, because having to look at these people who have no regards for my son is difficult.""

The child's father described how painful this has been and explained how his heart felt Wednesday.

""It's dropped, and it's picking back up, and it's still pumping blood. I love my son, and I'm going to be there for him,"" said Joshua McAdams.

The couple maintains they just want what's best for their little boy.

As Noah fights leukemia, his parents have been fighting the system.

The toddler has already received two chemo treatments at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, according to family members. However, when Noah's mother and father took him out of state last week, seeking a second opinion, they were stopped in Ketucky by law enforcement.

Shortly after, they lost custody of their son.

The parents hired an attorney and took their fight to court, hoping a judge would rule in their favor for a more natural approach to treating their young son's cancer.

They were pleased the court took time to listen to their concerns, but ultimately, heartbroken, when the ruling was announced Wednesday, after two days of grueling court testimony, that their son must undergo chemotherapy.

""It is a mixed bag, in that we obvously have to watch this child go through chemothearpy, but at least we know with the use of cannabis and other treatments that the child will be able to deal with chemotherapy, rather than not being able to have those alternative treatments available,"" their attorney, Michael MInardi, said.

For now, the child's grandparents have temporary custody, although Noah's mother and father will be allowed at his medical appointments and treatments.

The parents say they are working to regain custody of their little boy.

They explained that they're currently working with the Department of Children and Famlies to arrange unsupervised visits.

With the judge's ruling today, Noah is scheduled to receive chemotherapy treatment at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in downtown St. Petersburg today, according to his parents and their attorney.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/hillsborough-toddler-will-get-court-ordered-chemo-treatment-today/1991511210,2019-05-09T08:28:24Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
114,"Escambia County EMS ombudsman was part of 'good ol' boy' system, says ex-EMS director","CLOSE Dr. Rayme Edler speaks publicly for the first time about the allegations surrounding the Escambia County EMS division at the Escambia County Commission meeting Thursday, May 2, 2019. Courtesy of Escambia County, Pensacola News Journal

Escambia County's preliminary assessment by an ""ombudsman"" into the county's Emergency Management Services division and the entire Public Safety Department will be presented to County Commissioners on Thursday, but former two former senior public safety employees are already questioning the independence of the ombudsman.

Interim County Administrator Amy Lovoy, whose last day with the county is today, tapped former Public Safety Director Janice Kilgore as an ""ombudsman"" to do an assessment of EMS.

According to a statement released by the county at the direction of Lovoy, Kilgore was tasked with determining the answers to six questions:

Assessing the root issues in EMS/Fire that led to the vote of no confidence.

What is the communication chain for information dissemination both vertically and horizontally within the department?

What are the cause/causes of the perceived divisiveness and tribalism within the department?

Is there evidence of retaliation, perceived or real?

Is the workforce consistently and effectively utilized for their primary missions?

Is there a climate of favoritism shown by supervisors toward subordinates that negatively impacts the morale of the department?

""Kilgore is not only talented and experienced in public safety and large organization management, but she is also highly ethical, and we look forward to her findings,"" the statement said.

A 2005 file photo shows Janice Kilgore, then Escambia County Director of Public Safety, talking with Matt Lopez, then Chief of Emergency Management for Escambia County (lower left edge of photo) in the Emergency Operations Center on Sunday, July 10, 2005, as Hurricane Dennis approached Pensacola Beach. (Photo: file photo)

Escambia County's leadership is in turmoil after multiple resignations followed the revelation of allegations of falsifying training documents in EMS.

Kilgore worked in the county for 36 years, beginning as a clerk for the Santa Rosa Island Authority in 1972 and moving up to become the county's first ever Public Safety director when the job was created in 1997 after serving as the head of the county's Emergency Preparedness division, now known as Emergency Management.

Kilgore retired from the county in 2008.

When Lovoy tapped Kilgore as the county's ""ombudsman"" following the resignation of Public Safety Director Mike Weaver on April 9, members of the public, the EMS and fire unions and some county commissioners questioned the wisdom of appointing a former director to look into the department.

Now a former EMS director from 22 years ago is speaking out about his departure and the promotion of Kilgore, which he said created a culture of favoritism in Escambia County Public Safety.

Bruce Yelverton was director of EMS from 1983 to 1998 when EMS was its own department in the county.

Yelverton told the News Journal the decision to appoint Kilgore as an ""ombudsman"" to do an assessment of the culture of EMS is ""crazy.""

""A lot of this didn't happen overnight,"" Yelverton said. ""The stuff that happened way back to probably, I would say back to the time when I was forced out. She took over and micromanaged. It was a good ol' boy system. Who was in good with Janice would get her favor. Anybody that wasn't in good with Janice would be punished in various ways.""

Yelverton said he was pushed out after he accepted an invitation from then-president of Baptist Hospital Quint Studer to have EMS participate in an employee satisfaction survey.

Yelverton said the survey contained more positive than negative points, but the negative parts of the survey were leaked to the media.

The News Journal ran a short article on the front page of the Nov. 8, 1997, issue with the headline ""Rumors of privatization hurt morale of EMS workers."" The article described ""a survey in which a large number of employees in the EMS department said they believe the county is working to privatize the department"" and called it a ""wake up call for managers.""

Yelverton said he was criticized by the county administration for even participating in the survey. Two months later, Kilgore was named the county's Public Safety director for the new department, which at the time included Fire Services, Emergency Preparedness, EMS and Animal Control.

""She helped grow that culture to where it was,"" Yelverton said.

Moreover, Yelverton and others questioned how unbiased Kilgore can be knowing she hired and trained some of the very people she has been investigating.

Dr. Rayme Edler speaks: Escambia County medical director breaks her silence on EMS scandal

County spokeswoman Joy Tsubooka said Kilgore wasn't available to talk Wednesday as she was busy preparing for the presentation to the County Commission on Thursday.

Tsubooka pushed back on Yelverton's assessment, pointing out he was up for the same public safety director position Kilgore was hired for and he didn't get the job because the survey reflected negatively on his leadership of EMS.

""Why don't we give (Kilgore) a chance to give her report tomorrow and see what it's like and then go from there,"" Tsubooka said. ""...How can we say she's not going to be independent or doesn't know what she's talking about when we haven't even seen the work product that she's done?""

Yelverton said after Kilgore became his boss, she began to make changes that he had implemented to improve EMS performance through increased accountability. One example was metrics on ambulance crews' monthly performance was posted in EMS breakrooms, a practice ended under Kilgore.

Bob West, who was then the EMS quality assurance coordinator, confirmed Yelverton's account. West became the director of Public Safety for the Santa Rosa Island Authority in 2003. He said he left the county and went to SRIA because he disagreed with how Kilgore ran the department. West is credited with turning around the then-failing Pensacola Beach lifeguard program. He retired in 2015.

Tsubooka said that there have been nine county administrators since Yelverton was employed by the county.

Tsubooka said that speaking from her own personal experience working with Kilgore when Tsubooka previously worked for the county, she always knew what Kilgore wanted and where she stood.

""You can't get a more straight-talking, no-nonsense, on-top-of-it person,"" Tsubooka said. ""This whole stuff, from my personal experience, this good ol' boy thing, I don't believe it. Did she have very high expectation of her employees? You betcha. It was extremely high. And she expected you to meet it, or you were disciplined.""

Kilgore is set to publicly present her preliminary report at 9 a.m. Thursday to Escambia County Commission during their Committee of the Whole meeting in the commission chambers at the Ernie Lee Magaha Government Building in downtown Pensacola.

117,Palm Bay teacher accused of yanking student with autism from bus,"PALM BAY, Fla. - A school teacher who police said yanked a severely autistic student so hard that he fell face down from a school bus onto the pavement, was arrested last week.

The boy was not injured in the incident, which was also captured on the school's video surveillance system, according to News 6 partner Florida Today.

“It’s an active investigation,” said Nicki Hensley, spokesperson for Brevard Public Schools.

“Obviously we are taking it very seriously,” Hensley said.

Margaret Joyce O’Connor, 54, a teacher at Lockmar Elementary in Palm Bay, was charged with child abuse without causing great bodily harm after Palm Bay detectives were called to the campus May 2 to investigate reports of a child injured by an instructor. The Department of Children and Families also was called and O’Connor was placed on administrative leave as a criminal investigation got underway.

The incident happened at noon April 30, and drew the attention of administrators after an email to the assistant principal asked for the school transportation department to review video recordings on the bus to evaluate the student’s behavior. It was then that administrators saw O’Connor yank the student off the bus, reports show.

Police said O’Connor sent a note earlier to the assistant principal saying that the student had been disruptive on the bus recently and that she and the student both ""misstepped"" off the bus. The boy, however, was uncooperative.

The video shows O’Connor stepping onto the bus and screaming at the student to ""Stop it,” reports show. The boy apparently had been throwing his shoes before O'Connor got on the bus, reports show. O’Connor leaned over, unbuckled the boy from a seat belt harness and dragged him in the bus aisle, a video shows.

O’Connor then climbs down the bus stairs while the boy appears to brace himself, reports show. It was then that O’Connor appeared to jerk the child off the bus, records show.

O’Connor was booked into the Brevard County Jail. No hearing dates have been scheduled.

121,Storms in South kill girl in Florida,"A tree fell onto a house in Woodville, Florida, south of Tallahassee, killing the girl and injuring a 12-year-old boy.

ATLANTA — A strong storm system barreling through the South on Friday killed an 8-year-old girl in Florida and threatened to bring tornadoes to large parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia.

A tree fell onto a house in Woodville, Florida, south of Tallahassee, killing the girl and injuring a 12-year-old boy, according to the Leon County Sheriff's Office. The office said in a statement that the girl died at a hospital while the boy suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Their names weren't immediately released.

The same storm system was blamed for the deaths a day earlier of three people in Mississippi and a woman in Alabama.

The threat on Friday shifted farther east, where tornado warnings covered parts of northeast Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia.

The national Storm Prediction Center said 9.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were at a moderate risk of severe weather. The region includes the Charlotte, North Carolina metro area.

Torrential downpours, large hail and a few tornadoes were among the hazards, the National Weather Service in Raleigh, North Carolina, warned.

Radar readings appeared to show a tornado formed in western Virginia's Franklin County, south of Roanoke, though damage on the ground still must be assessed, said National Weather Service Meteorologist Phil Hysell. In South Carolina, authorities urged motorists to avoid part of Interstate 26 — the main artery from Upstate through Columbia and all the way to Charleston — because downed trees had left the roadway scattered with debris.

In Georgia, the storm system knocked down trees, caused flooding and cut off power to tens of thousands of people.

A tree came down on an apartment complex in an Atlanta suburb, but only one person reported a minor injury and was treated at the scene, Gwinnett County fire spokesman Capt. Tommy Rutledge told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

In Forsyth County northeast of Atlanta, three firefighters suffered minor injuries when their firetruck overturned during heavy rain and wind, Fire Department Division Chief Jason Shivers told the newspaper.

Meanwhile, hundreds of people cleaned up part of a central Mississippi town hit hard by a tornado on Thursday.

Volunteers and family members were swarming the north side of Morton, where the National Weather Service says a twister with winds as high as 132 mph (212 kph) hit a neighborhood. More than 20 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. The town of 3,500 is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Jackson.

""When it stopped, there was nothing left,"" Morton resident Sharon Currie told WAPT-TV. ""I was going, 'Oh my God. My house is gone.'""

Forecasters confirmed that 14 tornadoes had touched down in Mississippi and damage from the storm system was reported in at least 24 of the state's 82 counties. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency — the second one he has declared in less than a week due to tornadoes.

Authorities on Friday reported a third storm-related death in the state. Freddie Mobley, 63, died while helping cut a tree that had fallen on a house, Lincoln County Coroner Clay McMorris told the Daily Leader of Brookhaven. Mobley had made a few cuts on the tree and backed away when the trunk shifted before he could move, Deputy Coroner Ricky Alford said.

Two other people who were driving are being counted as storm-related deaths in Mississippi. A woman also died in Alabama when a tree fell on her mobile home Thursday.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190419/storms-in-south-kill-girl-in-florida?rssfeed=true,2019-04-19T21:36:31Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
122,"Storm topples tree, kills 8-year-old Florida girl","File photo. Storms cause damage in the South.

WOODVILLE, Fla. - A storm system moving through the South is being blamed for the death of an 8-year-old girl in Florida.

The Leon County Sheriff's Office said a tree fell Friday into a house in Woodville, south of Tallahassee, killing the girl and injuring a 12-year-old boy.

The office said in a statement that the girl died at the hospital while the boy has non-life-threatening injuries. Their names weren't immediately released.

Much of Florida was being hit Friday by strong storms that were also creating a threat of tornadoes in parts of the Carolinas and Virginia.

Most of Central Florida was under a weather warning, including a tornado watch, due to the system.

As of early Friday afternoon, no serious reports of damage had been reported.

134,Nissan Altima in Maleah Davis case found in Missouri City parking lot,"- Houston police say the silver Nissan Altima that 4-year-old Maleah Davis was said to be riding in when she was allegedly abducted has been located.

Police say the car was found in the parking lot of a Missouri City shopping center. Officers are on the scene.

Police have been searching for the car since Maleah was reported missing on Saturday. According to police, Maleah's stepfather Darion Vence said he, Maleah, and his 1-year-old son were ambushed by three men in a 2010 blue Chevrolet pick up Friday night in northeast Houston and abducted. Police say Vence said he and the boy were later left in Sugar Land.

Sugar Land police say Vence told investigators conflicting information. Police say he first said he walked to Sugar Land Methodist Hospital after regaining consciousness Saturday following the alleged abduction. Then, Sugar Land police say he changed his story to say he was dropped off there by someone in a car.

A Houston police investigator told FOX 26 that Vence is a person of interest in her disappearance.

Texas Equusearch resumed the ground search for Maleah in southwest Houston Thursday morning. Heavy rains on Tuesday left the search area flooded on Wednesday and caused Texas Equusearch to suspend their ground search. They searched by air instead.

Crews were initially looking for Maleah in northeast Houston but shifted search efforts to southwest Houston on Tuesday. Texas Equusearch set up a command post near the apartments where the girl is said to have lived with her mom and stepdad when she went missing.

If you have any information that can help police, you can call them or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS.

135,"Against parents' wishes, judge orders Tampa boy with leukemia to resume chemotherapy","Noah McAdams, 3, will soon resume what experts say is the most effective treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Parents Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball still want to try cannabis and natural remedies, however.

TAMPA — Standing in front of a row of news cameras, Joshua McAdams had a simple answer when asked how he felt about a judge ordering that his 3-year-old son resume chemotherapy treatment.

“It could have been worse,” said the 28-year-old father.

Moments earlier, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Caroline Tesche Arkin ruled Wednesday that Noah McAdams must immediately resume the first phase of chemotherapy to treat his leukemia against the wishes of his parents. Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball wanted to use medical marijuana and other natural remedies to treat their son instead of chemotherapy, which experts say is the most effective treatment to keep the child’s cancer from returning.

The parents and their attorney Michael Minardi, left the hearing disappointed but also encouraged. They said the judge held off on ruling whether Noah will have to complete the second and third rounds of chemotherapy, and allowed the parents to try other therapies, too.

“The best thing about this ruling is she didn't chart the course for 3½ years,” Minardi said. “She charted this course for the first phase of chemotherapy only and encouraged the parties to get together and talk about other possibilities.”

Wednesday’s hearing was the latest chapter in a legal and medical tug-of-war over Noah, who was diagnosed April 4 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow.

The parents said the boy underwent two rounds of chemo at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg last month before they decided to stop the treatment because they worried about side effects. Then deputies said the parents missed scheduled treatments at All Children’s and disappeared with their son in late April. Child protective investigators obtained a court order to take Noah into custody and the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office put out an endangered child alert for the boy on April 29, saying the parents “refused to follow up with lifesaving medical care that the child needs.”

Later that day authorities tracked down the family in Kentucky and took them into custody. The parents have said they were on their way to Cincinnati to consult with a doctor, not trying to flee Florida.

The Department of Children and Families asked for the emergency hearing to get the court’s permission to treat Noah according to recommendations from oncologists. Arkin made her ruling after several hours of testimony held over two days. Arkin granted a request from a guardian at litem attorney representing Noah to close the proceedings to the news media to keep the child’s medical information private.

The only source of what happened in court are the parents and their attorney. No one other parties have spoken about the proceedings. State officials did not respond to a request for comment late Wednesday.

At least two oncologists testified for the state. Minardi complained that he didn't have enough time to schedule his own expert witnesses but was able to arrange for Dr. Kelly King, a co-founder of ReleafMD Center for Medical Marijuana in Brandon, to testify about the benefits of cannabis.

Arkin's written order was not available Wednesday. The parents’ attorney said Noah must resume chemotherapy at All Children's as soon as Thursday. Meanwhile the parents can continue searching for other treatment options and get a second medical opinion.

The judge did not rule on the issue of who gets custody of the child. For now, Noah will remain with his grandparents. But the parents said they hope to soon get permission for unsupervised visits and will be there when he gets his chemotherapy treatment.

In addition to cannabais therapy, the parents plan to use oxygen therapy, an alkaline diet and herbal remedies, said the 22-year-old mother.

“Other than that, just giving him the most happiness and the least stress as possible,” Bland-Ball she said.

A mediation session between the parents and the state to discuss Noah's treatment is scheduled for June 4. There will be another court hearing the next day, Minardi said.

The type of leukemia Noah has can be cured in greater than 90 percent of cases with a full regimen of chemotherapy that begins as soon as possible after diagnosis, said Dr. Bijal D. Shah, head of the Moffitt Cancer Center’s acute lymphoblastic leukemia program. Shah, who is not involved in Noah's treatment or the legal case, told the Tampa Bay Times that the entire chemotherapy regimen, including the final, less intense “maintenance"" phase typically lasts about 2½ years.

Shah said experts it's too early to say cannabis shows any promise as an alternative treatment as effective as chemo.

“When we're talking about marijuana, it's really important to put it in the context of experimental therapy,” Shah said. “Are we ready at this point to encourage experimental therapy when the alternative is a standard treatment with a high rate of cure? I can't see how marijuana is going to get there.”

I received a friend request from Lisa. Reconnecting with my birth mother was just a click away. I immediately accepted and asked my co-anchor Jacey Birch to record the moment when I sent her my first message.

""Hi. Wow, I just saw this today. I've known your name since I was a child. I'm so happy you reached out. I'm having a hard time believing it's real,"" I wrote.

Within minutes, Lisa wrote back. She told me that she always knew my name and where I had grown up. She lives in rural Illinois, but she has been watching my career online for more than a decade.

She streamed newscasts online and followed me through social media. She watched as I announced the birth of my children and moved to South Florida.

I sent her photos of my childhood, introducing a boy she didn't get to watch grow up.

Eric Yutzy and his birth mother Lisa shared photos over Facebook.

She sent photos of herself and other family members I never knew I had, like two half-sisters.

Decades of a life were crammed into one thread with a common refrain: ""I am so happy.""

After a day of texts, it was time to talk.

""How are you?"" Lisa asked.

""I'm great. How are you?"" I replied.

""I am good,"" she said.

""Yeah, how you feeling?"" I asked.

""Nervous, but excited. How are you?"" Lisa asked.

""I feel nervous and excited,"" I said.

""Cool,"" Lisa said.

""We must be related,"" I said.

The nerves fell quickly away and we talked and laughed for a long time. Minute by minute, we began feeling more and more familiar and familial.

""Whatever you wanted to be, you needed that, and I couldn't do it,"" Lisa said. ""You needed to be able to grow to your full potential and become an amazing human being. You needed that.""

A California mother has filed a lawsuit against Etsy after her 18-month-old boy son was strangled by an item bought on the retail website.Deacon Morin was found unresponsive after being placed down for a nap Oct. 5 at Marriott Family Child Care in Fontana. He was rushed to a hospital, where he died five days later.Investigators say the boy was wearing a beaded necklace around his neck when he took the nap. CBS Los Angeles reports the necklace tightened and did not release, causing Deacon to suffocate. The teething necklace was given to his mother, Danielle Morin, as a gift by a close friend who purchased it on Etsy, a website that specializes in handmade items. According to the online receipt, the necklace is meant to help alleviate pain for teething babies and is supposed to have a releasing safety clasp that automatically releases when pulled on. ""Baby necklaces, if you use a baby necklace should have a releasing safety clasp so if there's any pulling on it, it releases. This one that was purchased on Etsy had a screw on clasp that could not be released. And so when baby Deacon was hung up on something, it didn't release and caused him to suffocate,"" Morin’s attorney, John Carpenter, said. Carpenter said the Etsy is legally responsible for Deacon’s death and has filed a lawsuit against the website in addition to the Lithuanian company that provided the necklace.The terms of use listed on Etsy’s website state, in part, “the items in our marketplaces are produced, listed, and sold directly by independent sellers so Etsy cannot and does not make any warranties about their quality, safety, or even their legality. Any legal claim related to an item you purchase must be brought directly against the seller of the item. You release Etsy from any claims related to items sold through our services.”Carpenter says that Morin did not agree to these legal disclosures because she received the necklace as a gift.""I want parents to know there is no more Toys R Us and people need to go online to buy products and these products are dangerous and these products aren't always safe.

139,Body cam released in takedown of man accused of trying to drown his son,"- Body cam video from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office shows the moments they took down and arrested Wilkens Ordena in March.

The footage shows a late-night chase ending in Orange County.

Inside the car is Wilkens Ordena, the man Orange County deputies say tried to drown his own son in a pool in March.

Fox 35 spoke with the toddler’s mother Tuesday.

The boy, Kameron, is doing just fine now.

“That’s what hurts me the most is that he had to go through it. My son is much happier. That’s what I can notice from him, that he is way happier,” said Shantia Warren, the boy's mother.

Deputies say Ordena tried to drown his nearly 2-year-old son because he was angry his father was babysitting him that night.

After family members rescued the boy from the pool, Ordena drove off, crashed into deputies’ vehicles and kept going until the moments shown in the body cam footage.

Deputies work hard to get Ordena out of the car, but he won’t budge.

146,Deadly April storms leaves trail of damage across Florida,"The Leon County Sheriff's Office said an 8-year-old girl was killed and a 12-year-old boy was injured when a tree hit this mobile home in Woodville, just south of Tallahassee.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A line of severe thunderstorms and possible tornados barreled across North Florida on Friday morning, leaving at least one child dead and a second injured near Tallahassee. The front facade of a furniture store in Kingsland, Georgia, was ripped off by high winds and a tractor-trailer was blown over on the causeway to St. Simons Island.

An 8-year-old girl was killed and a 12-year-old boy was injured when a massive oak tree fell through their mobile home in Woodbine about 8 a.m. The Leon County Sheriff's Office said a 12-year-old boy was also injured. Their father and two other children were unhurt, but a GoFundMe post set up for the family said that the home house was demolished.

A tree also came down on a mobile home near Live Oak, but there were no injuries were reported. There were hundreds of reports of trees, limbs and powerlines down across the News4Jax viewing area.

Authorities said straight-line winds were responsible for blowing the front wall off the Badcock Furniture in Kingsland. A viewer who sent a photo of the damage reported seeing a funnel coming from the clouds.

""This was after what looked to be a tornado hovered over the store and receded back into the sky,” Rhonda Askin wrote.

Baker County Fire-Rescue reported that two people injured when an SUV went off a slick road and hit a tree in Glen St. Mary, near the Florida-Georgia border.

Most people's brush with the storm was downed limbs, trees and powerlines.

Tammie's Kane's car parked near the intersection of King Street and Riverside Avenue was damaged when a tree fell on it.

""It came on fast. It started raining and it was pretty windy and then, boom, right after that the tree fell,"" she said. ""Cars can be fixed and replaced and people can’t.""

The Clay County Sheriff's Office reported road underwater and with trees, power lines and debris down. They urge people to report serious damage to the authorities and drive with extra care.

A Southwest Airlines flight from Nashville to Jacksonville was reported to have been struck by lightning before landing safely just before 11 a.m. The flight was scheduled to continue on to Fort Lauderdale but an airline spokeswoman told News4Jax the plane was taken out of service for a maintenance review.

A passenger on the plane said they weren't told about a lightning hit. The only thing he noticed on the approach to JAX was excess turbulence.

About a dozen other flights to and from Jacksonville were either canceled or delayed Friday due to weather, which is bad across a wide swath of the eastern United States.

Florida State University and Florida A&M, both in Tallahassee, didn't open until noon Friday, when the heavy weather had passed. Santa Fe College in Gainesville closed at midday, asking all students and staff to shelter in place. NAS Jacksonville sent nonessential employees home at 1 p.m.

About 1:30 p.m., Clay Electric reported 13,553 power outages between Alachua, Baker, Clay, Columbia and Union counties. JEA reported more than 7,000 customers out during the noon hour, but the number was under 1,000 by 1:30 p.m. Florida Power and Light was reporting isolated outages scattered across its north Florida coverage area.

150,Alliance honors locals with Community Service Awards,"Eighteen local leaders were honored last week with Lake County Community Service Awards for their investments in Lake County in the areas of business, philanthropy, public safety and other sectors.

Over the years, the Community Service Awards, hosted by the Lake County Chamber Alliance, has honored hundreds of people for contributing in ways seen and unseen for the betterment of this county and these communities that we cherish so dearly and that we call home. The honorees are citizens of surpassing accomplishment, individuals who combine immense personal and professional talent with an unbridled commitment to service. Their work transforms lives.

Molsick, who developed a passion for art at a young age, enjoyed a successful career as the owner and creative director of an advertising agency. In 2002, her desire to pursue her art full time won out, so she began to study with nationally known artists and eventually decided to share her gifts with her own students through the Mount Dora Center for the Arts and the Leesburg Center for the Arts. She was a founding member of Artisans on Fifth, Mount Dora’s successful artist cooperative gallery, and she recently debuted the Wild Ibis Art Studios and Gallery in Eustis, which is a cooperative of seven working artists.

Hussain is a true American success story. After migrating to the U.S. from Pakistan, he opened two restaurants in Central Florida in 1989, including one in Mount Dora. They were large and required a massive commitment of time, so he closed them after several years and went to work for Yum! Brands, managing KFC and Taco Bell stores. Ten years in corporate America was enough for Akhtar, so he went back into business for himself, opening the 500-square-foot Village Coffee Pot in Mount Dora in 2006 and then the 1,000-square-foot Mount Dora Confectionary in 2010.

Tiffany Bannworth looks into the faces of her seven children and sees her husband.

They are all she has left of the man who'd been her life partner for nearly 20 years. Stephen Bannworth died in August in a Fort Myers motorcycle crash.

This Mother's Day, the Cape Coral mother will celebrate each of the boys they created and the miracle daughter born nine months after his death with a nice dinner and family outing.

""We're replacing a bad memory with remembrance of happiness and celebration,"" she said of the holidays and anniversaries since their lives upended.

Tiffany Bannworth sits with her children Dante Alexander, 16; Cairo Hawthorne, 12; Jasper Constantine, 10; Roman Zhivago, 8; Quinton Phineas,7; Kipling Cicero, 5; and Amunet Corencia Pearl, 2.5 weeks. Bannworth's husband Steven died in a motorcycle crash last year. Calling him the ""perfect husband"" he left her a lingering gift: A baby girl, born on Good Friday. (Photo: Ricardo Rolon, Ricardo Rolon/The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

The six boys look like their dad Stephen Bannworth at different stages of his life, she said, as she cradles his final gift in her arms.

Amunet Corencia Pearl Bannworth arrived on Good Friday. The 35-year-old mother gave her the moniker they'd decided upon if it was girl during a 2007 pregnancy, their third.

""He would recognize it anywhere,"" she said of their daughter's name. Amunet is the Egyptian goddess of mystery. She joins siblings Dante, Cairo, Jasper, Roman, Quinton and Kipling Bannworth. A seventh son, Gatsby Bannworth, died six years ago at 3 months old.

Oldest son Dante, 16, said last year started out ""great at first,"" the six boys and their parents taking weekend outings and enjoying their time with one another.

Then, his father's death abruptly changed their trajectory.

""Now it sucks because my dad wanted a girl,"" Dante Bannworth said, his father's prayers answered in death, only never to see her.

Stephen Bannworth was a stay-at-home dad. He and Tiffany met and courted, having Dante when Tiffany was 19. Stephen supported her dreams, saw her through college and her doctorate.

She is now executive director at Nicaea Academy of Southwest Florida, a birth through college education facility in Cape Coral. Amunet sleeps in her mother's office, all six boys always nearby, attending classes.

The family's closeness is no surprise. It's what Stephen Bannworth cultivated, Tiffany Bannworth said.

Tiffany and Stephen Bannworth were with each other every day — a streak of 3,992 of them — since Sept. 1, 2007, she said. If she went on a quick archaeology trip — one of her many interests and qualifications — she left Saturday morning and returned Sunday night, making sure they kissed good-bye and hello.

Tiffany, an only child, had always known Stephen wanted a big family.

The Bannworth family is nearly three times the size of the average family. The U.S. Census Bureau counted about 83.09 million families with an average of 3.14 persons in 2018, down from 3.7 in the 1960s.

Dante was the first baby Tiffany Bannworth ever held. Within weeks, she told Stephen she wanted more. Lots more.

Four years after Dante, the Bannworths had five more sons within six years.

Their sixth, Gatsby, died in his sleep three months after his birth.

""We thought that was the unthinkable,"" she said. But Stephen held the family together.

""He was so strong and cultivated a tight-knit family,"" she said. ""A part of our hearts were missing. He carried us through the grief.""

Within the year, son Kipling was born, and Stephen understood Tiffany's fears of losing another child.

""I was scared it could happen again,"" Tiffany Bannworth said. ""He said he would quit his job and watch Kipling until he went to school.""

He kept that promise: Kipling started kindergarten days after Stephen's death.

In the years between, Stephen Bannworth washed their clothes, cooked and cleaned and did all the home repairs himself.

""Some people thought he was just some schlub,"" she said. ""He was so incredible. He was more of a man than I could ever imagine meeting.""

Their passion lasted their entire marriage.

Over the summer, the family car needed replacing.

While waiting on a new vehicle to arrive last August, Stephen Bannworth would take Tiffany to work on the back of his motorcycle. He did so the Saturday before his death.

He would park across from the main building on campus and rev the engine as she walked across the lot.

""He'd blow kisses and wink,"" she said. ""I still got flustered. We were really love struck.""

She drove the new vehicle to school for the first time the morning he died. He had fixed the locks on the vehicle to prepare it for use the day before. He'd also repaired the curio cabinet glass, cleaned the house and washed every bit of laundry, not knowing he wouldn't return from his motorcycle ride.

She remembers the acute feeling of loss in the days after his death — she didn't have a single stitch of clothing remaining that carried his scent.

""The glaring absence of him was noticed by me,"" she said, adding she was in her bed, crying to God: ""Let me be pregnant with his last child.'""

Then, when her pregnancy was confirmed six weeks later, ""How blessed I felt. What a miracle it was.""

Friends, family and even strangers stepped up to help fill the void. A GoFundMe campaign raised more than $12,000; a woman linked to the Nicaea school paid for the entire funeral. Christmas came and people showered the family with gift cards.

People told her stories about how Stephen had helped them, without her ever knowing.

On the weekend that would have been their wedding anniversary, friends gathered to celebrate the couple. The next day, Tiffany Bannworth said, 50 people came to her baby shower.

On her birthday Tuesday, the school's students gathered around a store-bought birthday cake with the bright yellow icing, macaroons and doughnuts. Her sons surrounded her, Amunet on her lap, as everyone sang 'Happy Birthday.""

It's a new memory, to complement the other birthdays where Stephen would make any kind of cake she asked.

""It's difficult to be away from him,"" she said. ""There's never going to be another man like Steve.""

As Mother's Day loomed, she reflected on what she learned from the man she knew she could spend several lifetimes with and follow the example he set.

""He was very loving and doting and protective and very pure,"" she said. "" ... Co-parenting with him was a piece of cake.""

That they are a strong family and going through life together shows in how the brothers have welcomed Amunet.

""They are very protective of her,"" Tiffany Bannworth said, ""especially (Kipling). They don't want anybody to touch her.""

She will spend her Mother's Day, the first having a daughter, thinking about the man who helped her become a mom and making memories with the six versions of himself he left behind.

""This was a day that Stevie lavished me with gifts and attention,"" she said. He'd take the boys to a thrift store to look for antique glass.

""I have a big collection, but I refuse to spend a lot of money on it,"" she said. ""That used to bug Steve. He liked to buy me expensive things, but I liked the novelty of finding it for next to nothing.

""This year there will be none of that.""

She planned to cook a nice dinner on Saturday, inviting her mother to join them.

She cherishes the memories Stephen left her with, their last morning together and their final embrace.

""Boy, would I kill for another kiss from my husband,"" she said.

157,'Maddox has got to be mafia': Read the most shocking quotes from J.T. Burnette's indictment,"CLOSE Stephen Dobson III, attorney for Scott Maddox, and Stephen Webster, attorney for Paige Carter-Smith, discuss the corruption case outside federal court. Jeff Burlew, Democrat senior writer

In conversations recorded by the FBI, developer J.T. Burnette paints a damning portrait of Scott Maddox.

While Maddox has pleaded not guilty to all charges, Thursday's superseding indictment adds more evidence to federal prosecutors' case against the suspended city commissioner.

When reached Thursday, Maddox's attorney had not yet reviewed the Burnette indictment.

The excerpts below are taken directly from the indictment. Read the entire document here.

► Indictment No. 3: Prolific Tallahassee businessman J.T. Burnette indicted in FBI corruption investigation

► Who is J.T. Burnette?:Indicted real estate mogul a key player in Tallahassee redevelopment

'Deliver the politics'

""Burnette stated that his only role in the project would be to 'deliver the politics' and for that, he would receive 20% of the deal. Burnette stated that he would 'take care of Scott,' and he would do so from his 20%.""

'He wants his piece of the pie'

""A Company F (Southern Pines) representative stated that in his experience, politicians often start with altruistic viewpoints and then realize that many people surrounding them, including developers, have a lot of money and start asking 'where's my piece of the pie.' Burnette responded: 'Let me tell you this: Scott Maddox is that guy. What I mean is, he wants his piece of the pie.'

'Vengeful motherf-----'

""After the Company F representatives began paying money to Governance and Gov. Services, Burnette told the representatives that they could not stop paying Maddox, agreeing that stopping payments to Maddox wouId 'p--- him off more and will vote against' them. Burnette further told Company F representatives that Maddox 'is a vengeful motherf-----. Feed a dog for a year, stop feeding that dog, and it gets hungry, he may bite your f------ hand off.'""

'Out of spite' and 'it will be served cold'

""On or about January 10, 2017, Burnette told a representative of Company F not to stop sending checks to Maddox, as Maddox can kill deals. Burnette further stated that 'Maddox has got to be a mafia, if you think he isn’t, shame on you.' Burnette continued that the Company F representative 'opened the door and now can’t close it, as Maddox will f--- you out of spite.' Burnette opined 'out of spite, absolutely and that it will be served cold.' Burnette also told the Company F representatives that 'if you want to burn your house down fine, but I won’t let my house burn down with yours.'""

158,Alleged Pasco child predator faced similar accusations more than 10 years ago,"8 On Your Side Investigates has uncovered new information about an accused child sex predator from Pasco County.

Since February, Joseph Anthony Ponchot, 49, has been in custody for various alleged crimes including possessing and transmitting child pornography, promoting sexual performance by a child and sexual battery. 8 On Your Side has learned that more than 10 years ago, Ponchot was accused of sexually abusing another child in Zephyrhills. That case went nowhere.

Records show that the 49-year-old was arrested after alleged pornographic files were flagged online in February.

8 On Your Side spoke with a woman who says her son was one of Ponchot's victims.

We are not releasing her identity in order to protect the child's privacy.

""My son was friends with his son,"" said the woman.

According to a Pasco County arrest report dated Feb. 11, Ponchot admitted to having child pornography and also producing it.

Deputies continued their investigation after the 49-year-old was booked. Additional charges were added twice in February and once in April.

According to a Pasco County arrest report dated April 17, Ponchot raped a 12-year-old boy and filmed the incident.

Detectives also state they've found more than 1,200 photos and videos of child pornography.

8 On Your Side continued to dig through documents released by the Zephyrhills Police Department.

We discovered that in November of 2008, another mother contacted police. The woman's son also claimed he had been sexually abused by Ponchot.

According to the paperwork, the child said it had happened ""numerous times when they lived with Mr. Ponchot.""

The State Attorney's Office declined to prosecute the case, according to Zephyrhills police.

In December of 2013, there was another case.

Police received an anonymous tip about a suspicious comment online. The person thought Ponchot was having a relationship with a child.

According to police documents, Zephyrhills detectives investigated and found the complaint to be baseless.

This story mirrors that of another accused child sex predator that 8 On Your Side has been tracking.

Manuel McGhee is a former decorated veteran. According to the Winter Haven Police Department, he slipped through the cracks for at least 13 years.

Right now, both men are in custody.

We will continue to follow this developing story.",http://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/investigations/alleged-pasco-child-predator-faced-similar-accusations-more-than-10-years-ago/1990401655,2019-05-08T22:28:11Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

162,1 dead in STEM school shooting outside Denver,"HIGHLANDS RANCH, Colo. (WFLA/AP) - At least one person is dead after a shooting at a STEM school outside of Denver, according to KUSA.

That person's identity has not been released.

Initial reports said eight students were admitted to hospitals.

A shooting at a suburban Denver middle school injured seven people Tuesday, and two suspects were in custody, authorities said.

KUSA reports the suspects are one juvenile boy and an adult man. Officials said they believe both are students at the school.

According to KUSA, the shooters walked into the school and engaged students in two seperate locations.

Lines of firetrucks, ambulances and law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies were at the school and medical helicopters landed on a grassy field.

The shooting occurred at the middle school at STEM School Highlands Ranch, a public charter with more than 1,850 students in kindergarten through 12th grades.

The sheriff’s office said deputies responded around 1:50 p.m. to the school in the Highlands Ranch community about 15 miles south of Denver.

Nicholson-Kluth said police and deputies got there almost immediately and heard shots as they arrived. The school is near a sheriff’s department substation.

The sheriff’s office directed parents to a nearby recreational center to pick up their children.",https://www.wfla.com/national/1-dead-in-stem-school-shooting-outside-denver/1986831957,2019-05-07T23:54:36Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

167,Emergency hearing scheduled today for Hillsborough toddler at center of medical custody battle,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

TAMPA, Fla. - TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - An emergency hearing has been scheduled for 8 a.m. Tuesday morning regarding a Hillsborough toddler at the center of a medical custody battle.

Noah McAdams is currently battling leukemia.

However, his parents do not want him to undergo traditional chemotherapy treatment.

Instead, they want his cancer treated with a more organic approach, one that includes medical-grade cannabis.

Noah has already received two chemo treatments at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, according to family members.

The child's parents, Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball, are now taking their fight to court, hoping the state will allow them to treat their son's cancer using homeopathic methods, not chemotherapy.

The family maintains that's what they were doing when they left Hillsborough County last Monday with their 3-year-old son, sparking a multi-state search. The parents claim they were seeking a second opnion, searching for an alternative to chemo.

The family was eventually found safe in Kentucky.

Authorities put out urgent alerts for Noah, saying the boy was in need of ""lifesaving medical care.""

Hillsborough County deputies said the parents failed to bring their son to a medically-necessary hospital procedure last week, then refused to follow up with additional lifesaving medical care.

""We just want of the therapies less drastic than chemotherapy,"" Noah's mother said.

The parents have temporarily lost custody of their son and the boy is with his grandparents.

""These parents are absolutely not looking to let their kid suffer, they're going to treat this child,"" said Michael Minardi, the attorney representing Noah's parents.

The couple tells News Channel 8 they absolutely do not want chemotherapy for their child, insisting that other treatments be considered.

""I want my son home and for him to be treated with a treatment that is not going to damage his little body so much,"" said Noah's mom.

The parents want to use medical cannabis, CBD oils, vitamins and a strict diet to treat Noah's cancer.

The couple tells us they're not opposed to treatment, they just want to do it differently.

""We want him to be treated with something that has less side effects,"" Noah's mother said. ""Chemotherapy is so brutal on a body.""

A judge will consider both sides of the case on Tuesday morning.

""The best outcome is that the judge says, 'nope. I'm not going to order any treatment. Let the parents do what they choose, as long as they are treating the child,'"" the family's attorney said.",https://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/emergency-hearing-scheduled-today-for-hillsborough-toddler-at-center-of-medical-custody-battle/1985508770,2019-05-07T08:21:03Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

169,"Boy, 11, charged with arson in connection with Sebastian boat, trailer fires","CLOSE Indian River County fire crews responded after an explosion was reported near U.S. 1 in Sebastian on Friday, March 15, 2019. A boat had caught fire. Eric Rogers, Florida Today

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — An 11-year-old boy faces two felony counts of arson after deputies said he and a friend set fire to a trailer and boat on a lot behind a Sebastian neighborhood.

The boat fire, reported at the end of Essex Lane off Schumman Drive, caused a small explosion March 15 when flames caught on 50 gallons of fuel left aboard, sending up thick plumes of smoke to the surrounding area.

No injuries were reported in that blaze, nor when a small metal trailer on the same lot burned to the ground a month earlier.

More: Cause of Sebastian boat fire, explosion may remain mystery

Investigators with the Bureau of Fire, Arson and Explosives Investigations determined the fires were intentionally set and interviewed the boy after he was named in an anonymous tip, the warrant said.

The boy denied starting the fires but was named by two friends, who told police he had caused the boat fire by torching the seat cushions with a lighter and used lantern fuel and matches to burn the trailer.

He was arrested Friday and taken to the Department of Juvenile Justice in Fort Pierce.

Investigators also implicated one of the friends, who was present for or participated in starting the fires, according to the warrant. Sebastian police Lt. Timothy Wood said the state attorney's office is determining whether charges will be filed.

The total value of the burned property was about $7,000, investigators said.

Indian River County Fire officials originally told reporters no actions would be taken after the boat fire, despite suspicions of arson, because the boat had little or no monetary value.

Sebastian police officials also said they would not investigate but later contacted Bureau investigators after detectives determined a series of fires in the area were likely connected.

174,Florida waitress leaps off pier to save boy in distress,"- A Daytona Beach woman jumped off a pier to save a boy, but she ended up with serious injuries.

Hanna Pignato, 19, was working a shift as a waitress at Joe’s Crab Shack Saturday night on the Main Street Pier. At about 8 o’clock, she heard a commotion below, realizing it was a mother screaming for her boy who was struggling in a rip current.

“She was so scared, it scared me so bad,” said Pignato.

With nobody around trying to save the boy, she jumped into action.

“I surf and I swim, so I thought, I can get to that kid,” said Pignato.

That’s all the convincing the waitress needed.

“I don’t even remember taking off my shoes and then I just jumped,” she said.

What she didn’t see was a sandbar below the pier. The water was less than three feet deep where she landed, breaking her back and foot on impact.

“Excruciating pain excruciating pressure, agony,” said Pignato.

Despite her injuries, she kept swimming.

“I wasn’t gonna give up but I knew I wasn’t going to save him at that point, which really broke my heart and I was just broken hearted,” said Pignato.

Moments later, Pignato was rescued -- she recalls a stranger comforting her on the beach.

“I remember, she was holding my back, she was just rubbing it and everybody was arguing because everyone was so frantic, you know,” said Pignato.

She was rushed to Halifax Health Medical Center of Daytona Beach for treatment and has since been overwhelmed with love and support for her act of bravery.

“So many people are reaching out to me, from all over, and I didn’t think that just trying to help somebody, I would get so much love, that’s not what I was trying to do, I was just trying to help him,” said Pignato.

The boy was rescued, but Pignato wants her story to inspire others to rise to the occasion to help.

“To go out of their way to help people, if you see somebody hungry on the street and you have something extra, give it to them, if you see somebody sad, smile at them,” said Pignato.

Her co-workers and friends have established a Go Fund Me account for her medical bills and to help her get by while she is out of work recovering.

190,It’s a boy! Birth photo showing mother’s surprised reaction goes viral,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — A photo showing a North Carolina mother’s surprised reaction to her newborn son has gone viral.

Winston-Salem photographer Lauren Jolly captured the moment last December while working with Nancy and Will Ray.

Jolly said the couple had waited to learn the sex of their first two babies at birth, but opted to find out early during the third pregnancy, and they were told it was a girl.

When the big moment finally arrived, Jolly said she rushed to the birth center just in time to photograph the baby’s speedy arrival.

“She delivered her baby in the tub and then carried ‘her’ over to the bed,” Jolly recalled. “About 10 minutes later, they prepared to cut baby’s cord and Nancy exclaimed, ‘What is THAT? Is this a boy baby?!'”

Jolly said Will looked closer to confirm, and fell to his knees.

“We were all in shock and couldn’t stop laughing,” Jolly said. “I’m so glad I was there to capture this moment – that’s the magic of birth photography!”

Nancy posted the image to her Instagram page where it currently has more than 6,000 likes.

“I will forever advocate for birth photography because this is one of my very favorite photos of all time. Thank you @laurenjollyphoto,” she wrote.

Jolly told WGHP that she knew it was a great story, but she never expected it to take off the way it has.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/05/06/its-a-boy-birth-photo-showing-mothers-surprised-reaction-goes-viral/,2019-05-06T13:58:09Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394

Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball rallied for their three-year-old son Noah who has leukemia. Earlier this week, they took the boy to Kentucky which sparked a search for them.

The couple avoided getting the boy chemotherapy because they claim it would be too tough on his body.

""I cannot believe how many people are rallying on social media and have rallied out here in the middle of the day in Florida. I mean its sweltering hot and they're out here with their kids and they believe in this movement,"" Bland-Ball said.

Right now the boy is in his grandmother's custody. The couple tells WFLA they're not opposed to treatment, they just want to do it differently.

194,"Former Bad Company singer Brian Howe plans to sell Florida house, donate to dog rescue group","CLOSE Former Bad Company singer Brian Howe talks about his 2017 heart attack. The animal lover lives on Fort Myers Beach with seven dogs and three birds. Charles Runnells, crunnells@news-press.com

There’s a lot of history in Brian Howe’s house on Fort Myers Beach.

It’s where the rock singer wrote and recorded many of the songs for his old band, Bad Company. It’s where he records his podcasts with people like former band mate Ted Nugent and Moon landing conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel.

And it’s where he lives with his beloved birds and dogs, including a particularly friendly “Florida brown dog” named Rosie.

But now, Howe plans to say goodbye to that house — and to Fort Myers Beach, too.

He’s moving to the Nashville area, where he wants to buy a bigger piece of property, collect more animals and perhaps start a new career as a songwriter.

“There’s mixed emotions,” says Howe, 65, about leaving Fort Myers Beach after living there for 34 years. “But I do believe that every now and again in life, it’s good to shake things up and to make a change. And it’s good to explore new pastures.”

His love for animals

Before he goes, though, Howe wants to do one last thing for the animals he loves. After he sells his beach house, he’ll give a portion of that money to Boca Raton dog rescue group Have A Heart, Inc.

Howe says he’s loved animals since he was a small boy — particularly dogs. That’s why he devotes a lot of time to helping those animals, including recording songs for animal charities and serving on the board of both Have a Heart and Guatemala nonprofit AYUDA (Spanish for “help”).

“Animals don’t really have a voice,” Howe says, sitting with Rosie in his upstairs music room full of guitars, amplifiers and recording equipment. “They don’t have anyone that can speak up for ‘em.

Former Bad Company lead singer Brian Howe is selling his Fort Myers Beach home and moving to Nashville. The longtime animal advocate plans to donate a portion of the sale to the Have a Heart Animal Foundation. He'll be holding an open house on April 27. He is shown with several of his dogs. (Photo: Andrew West/The News-Press USA Today Network-Florida, The News-Press)

""I’m not pretending I’m some sort of animal hero — because I’m not. But I do love ‘em.”

Open house

Howe will hold an open house for his two-story Fort Myers Beach house from 6:30-8:30 p.m. Saturday. The 4,100-square-foot Old Florida-style house — including 2,300 square feet of air-conditioned living space — is listed for $749,000. The property features a wrap-around porch, a downstairs apartment and an Olympic-sized swimming pool.

Howe will be attending the open house, says Realtor Trish Kelly of Advantage Florida Real Estate. Plus there will be food, drinks, live entertainment and a silent auction that includes a signed guitar owned by Howe, a gold Bad Company record, a private acoustic concert and dinner with Howe.

A charity close to his heart

There will also be a collection jar for donations to Have A Heart. All the money raised at the open house will go toward the charity, too, Kelly says.

“I think it’s a neat idea,” she says about the charity event/open house. “It shows how much he cares for animals.”

Janice Green, founder and president of Have a Heart, says the money will be used to help many of the charity's rescued dogs with surgery and other medical needs, including dogs with broken legs and heart worms.

Howe has helped the charity many times over the years, including playing fundraising concerts. “He’s very generous,” Green says, “and he helps us whenever he can.”

Howe says he’s leaving Fort Myers Beach for several reasons. He’s annoyed with the constant construction on nearby Estero Boulevard. Red tide has been causing him breathing problems. And ever since his 2017 heart attack, he can’t endure the heat as much.

Trying something new in Nashville

Another reason for the move: After years as a rock singer — including recording and co-writing Bad Company’s hit albums “Dangerous Age” and “Holy Water” — Howe’s thinking about trying something new. He’s hoping to start writing with other songwriters in Nashville, and perhaps try his hand at country music or become a full-time songwriter.

""I think I’m more of a songwriter now than I am a singer, although I still love to do shows,"" he says. ""I think I’ve explored most of the avenues of rock that you can go down, I think.

“It’s been a fun ride, but classic rock now is considered to be prehistoric, you know?”

He’s also toying with the idea of starting an animal rescue of his own, once he has a big enough piece of property to house all those animals.

“I really want to donate more time to helping more animals — and having more animals, I think,” he says. “I love the idea of having a donkey or two, rescuing a donkey. And maybe a pony. Chickens, you know.""

He grins. ""I want to become a farmer!” he says,

Howe doesn’t know how much he’ll be giving to Have a Heart. It depends on what the place sells for. He still needs enough money to buy his new place in Nashville, where he says property sells for much cheaper.

“It’ll be a good chunk, though,” he says.

He says he’ll likely visit Southwest Florida occasionally, since he has lots of friends and family members here (including his son Michael and granddaughter Kira). But he’s looking forward to this new chapter in his life.

“I’ve reached the age now where I really want to do something a bit more substantial with the things I love in life,” he says. “Although I do love music, of course, I love animals so much. And they’ve been predominantly a major part of my life.

“And I just feel that I could offer them more and rescue more animals if I make a move and buy property further north.”

Saturday’s open house is free and open to the public. To get the address, call Kelly at (941) 916-4079 or email HoweOpenHouse@hotmail.com.

195,"Florida House backs tougher texting, driving ban","0 Florida House backs tougher texting, driving ban

Law-enforcement officers could pull over motorists they see texting and driving, under a measure approved Tuesday by the House despite concerns the change could increase racial profiling.

However, the Senate is set to vote Wednesday on a different proposal that would only allow motorists to use hands-free wireless devices when they are traveling on Florida roads, a restriction that House leaders haven’t supported.

TRENDING:

The House voted 104-9 on the proposal (HB 107) by Rep. Jackie Toledo, R-Tampa, and Rep. Emily Slosberg, D-Boca Raton, that would shift texting while driving from a “secondary” offense to a “primary” offense.

Currently, police can only cite motorists for texting behind the wheel if they are pulled over for other reasons. By making it a primary offense, police could pull over motorists for texting while driving.

The House approved a similar measure last year, but the proposal failed to advance in the Senate.

STAY UPDATED: Download the Action News Jax app for live updates on breaking stories

“This bill is about one thing, saving lives,” said Slosberg, who has followed her father, former Rep. Irv Slosberg, in pushing for traffic-safety changes in the Legislature.

Emily Slosberg’s twin sister, Dori, was killed in 1996 when a speeding car in which they were passengers struck a median and crashed into an oncoming car.

As part of the House bill, law-enforcement officers would have to record the race and ethnicity of people who receive citations for texting while driving, which could allow tracking if certain motorists are being targeted.

Numerous black and Hispanic lawmakers raised concerns that making texting while driving a primary offense would lead to increased racial profiling of minority motorists.

Rep. Patricia Williams, D-Lauderdale Lakes, said she voted for the bill to save lives but wasn’t happy about how the measure could impact the “children that I serve.”

Williams said her son, who is a law enforcement officer, told her “you know you’re going to have problems with those officers not wearing the uniform for the right reasons.”

Rep. Dotie Joseph, D-North Miami, also raised concerns about law-enforcement officers targeting people of color like herself.

“These are issues that we cannot just brush under the rug,” Joseph said. “These are issues that in the current climate of our national discourse, people are afraid to get into these debates. People are afraid to get into these conversations because they make us uncomfortable.”

Rep. Al Jacquet, a Lantana Democrat who opposed the bill, warned of the potential repercussions of the measure.

“We’re going to look, and I want you to remember these words, we’re going to look back and we’re going to say, ‘Boy, were we wrong,’ ” Jacquet said. “While we had the right idea, the right mindset, the way we laid it out created a whole new problem.”

Meanwhile, without questions or comments, the Senate on Tuesday set up for a final vote its hands-free wireless proposal (SB 76).

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Wilton Simpson, a Trilby Republican next in line to become Senate president, is supported by traffic-safety advocates who want motorists to put down cell phones and other devices.

Both proposals would toughen the state’s longstanding ban on texting while driving, with the Senate measure also making it a primary offense.

Efforts in prior sessions in the Senate to toughen the law to a primary offense have failed, at least in part, because of concerns about racial profiling.

As part of Simpson’s proposal, county clerks of court would be able to dismiss cases of first-time offenders when violators buy wireless communications devices that can be used hands-free.

198,Southern Florida Make A Wish grants Sarasota boy's playground dream,"- Four-year-old Wyatt Ipe couldn't be happier after going through a surprise playground at his Sarasota, Florida home. The experience means everything to him and his parents, Jon and Crystal.

""He's been through so much. He’s taught everyone so much,"" said Jon.

Wyatt was born three months premature, weighing only two pounds. He faced 15 surgeries and medical procedures and spent nearly a year in the NICU.

Doctors gave him a 4% chance of survival and diagnosed him with chronic lung disease.

""The fact that he is still here, the doctors say, is a miracle. It’s because all of us all of our family just stood behind him and we never gave up on him,"" said Crystal.

Today, Wyatt always needs to be careful.

""He can get extremely sick and a small illness is not a small illness in his situation,"" said Jon.

Because a small illness can turn life-threatening, Wyatt can't use public playgrounds like most kids his age. So the Make A Wish Southern Florida decided to build him his own.

Wyatt's was their 16,000th wish granted.

""It will help him developmentally to be able to improve and it’ll make his life better,"" said Richard Kelley.

Richard Kelley, the chief operating officer of Make A Wish Southern Florida, said the playground will help Wyatt increase his physical and brain stimulation. It has an adaptive swing, slides, rock wall, sandbox, and sensory enhancements.

“It makes everything that he’s gone through... in the past just disappear for a little bit,"" said Crystal.

The new playground is already helping.

""Everybody calls him Wyatt the Warrior and we say, 'Never give up,'"" said Crystal.

Wyatt the Warrior now has his own place to dream, play, and make even happier memories.

""Saying [we are] thankful just isn’t even enough. Everything is just amazing and we are so incredibly grateful and thankful... We wouldn't be able to give him this,"" said Crystal.",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/southern-florida-make-a-wish-grants-sarasota-boy-s-playground-dream,2019-04-18T21:29:52Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609
199,Florida woman jumps off Daytona Beach Pier trying to save a drowning boy,"A mother on the beach screaming. A little boy bobbing in and out of rough waves, possibly drowning.

The sight terrified 19-year-old Hanna Pignato, so she jumped off the Daytona Beach Pier into the sea on Saturday evening to try to save the child.

""I was just thinking that could be my little sister I would hope someone would save,"" Pignato said with a deep sigh, lying in her hospital bed Sunday afternoon. ""So I jumped.""

Pignato, a surfer and swimmer, believed she could save the boy but as she fell into shallow waves she hit a sand bar.

""I wasn't thinking about the sand bar,"" she said. ""So I injured my back and broke my foot.""

The fall from the pier hurt Piganto's back and broke her right foot in three places, said her mother, Heather Pignato.

""She had surgery on her foot this morning,"" she said Sunday. ""I'm just glad she won't need surgery on her back.""

Hanna Pignato, a waitress who works on the rooftop of Joe's Crab Shack, told Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue officers that she jumped into the water to save the child shortly before 8 p.m., Ocean Rescue Capt. Tammy Malphurs said.

""An 8-year-old boy was caught in a rip north of the pier,"" Malphurs said, adding that the child was saved and taken to the hospital as a precaution.

""We also got a report of a woman, who appeared to be a Joe's Crab Shack employee, lying on the beach by the pier,"" she said. ""She advised us she jumped in to help save the boy.""

She said the agency discourages the public from attempting to rescue people and advised that it's better to call 9-1-1.

""We believe her heart is in the right place but we do not encourage people to try and rescue people drowning,"" Malphurs said.

Hanna Pignato said she just couldn't stand by as she watched the child's mother ""freaking out.""

""I didn't want the baby to die,"" she said, donning on the cap of her grandfather, a retired Volusia County sheriff's deputy who died last month. ""He wasn't a baby, he was 7 years old, 8 years old, but still I mean that's a human life you just can't look at that and walk away.""

Heather Pignato, who lives close to the beach, heard the sirens and headed out to see what was happening, not expecting to hear they were there for her daughter.

""I texted her and she didn't answer,"" the mother said. ""Then a friend from work called and said 'Don't worry Hanna is OK. A boy was drowning and she jumped in to save him.'""

Although her daughter was injured, she said she's proud of her because her intentions were good.

""She kept saying 'I'm sorry, don't be mad at me' and I said 'Hanna, you tried to save someone,'"" Heather Pignato said.

204,Clermont man guilty of hit-and-run fatality,"TAVARES — David Sheets is guilty of leaving the scene of an accident that claimed the life of pedestrian Aaron Zacharias in 2015, a jury decided after one hour Thursday.

The state argued that it proved four elements necessary for a conviction: that the driver was involved in a crash leaving the scene of an accident; knew he was involved in a crash; knew or should have known that the accident caused injury or death; and that he willfully failed to stop at or near the scene.

Much of the week-long testimony was highly technical, including Highway Patrol investigators talking about the complex mathematical equations used in their crime scene calculations, and a state crime lab analyst who testified that the odds of another person’s blood other than Zacharias’ being on the pickup truck’s broken windshield was 700-billion-to-1, or 100 times greater than the world’s population.

What the jurors did not hear was that Zacharias was a “mama’s boy,” in the words of his mother, Neena Zacharias.

“He was single … humble, loving, kind, a man anyone would like to talk to,” she said. “There was no judgment. He was a greater listener.”

He was the kind of person who would support his friends, no matter what. Unemployed at the time of the accident, he once worked at the Circle K he had walked to that night.

For someone with a gentle spirit, he had an unusual dream: He wanted to be an MMA fighter.

He walked the route down Lakeshore, not even a mile, every night, to lose weight, Neena laughed. He would always buy a bag of spicy potato chips, then walk home to his mother’s house on Priebe Road to play video games.

Defense attorney Kelly Johnson blasted what she called “weak links in the chain,” including a 911 caller’s testimony that he saw a light in the road and stopped to check it out. It was a cell phone with a flashlight app, he said, and he picked it up and used it to survey the scene. However, a later crime scene photo showed the phone lying face down, and it is unclear how the phone ended up in the hands of investigators.

There was also no proof that a flashlight found in the “on” position belonged to Zacharias, she said.

She also suggested that witnesses, including a woman who lived near the crash site, had “perfect times” in their timeline testimony because they had reviewed crash reports.

Assistant State Attorney Jason Nimeth, however, pointed out inconsistencies in Sheets'original statement to Florida Highway Patrol and a recorded report he made to his insurance company a month later.

Sheets claimed he thought he hit a deer, like the time he hit one on a country road in Georgia in 2008 or 2009. He said he stopped, went down Lake Shore, turned around and came back and still did not see anything.

Nimeth showed jurors a map and said the time, distance and cross streets Sheet cited made no sense.

Sheets self-reported the accident on Dec. 8, 2015 but did so because one of the clues at the accident site were pieces of Bondo, an auto body repair paste. His 1968 Chevy truck had chunks of the substance on the front from a prior accident, and he knew it would be difficult to get repairs with that information published in news reports, Nimeth said.

Circuit Judge Heidi Davis ordered a pre-sentence investigation. The maximum sentence is 30 years, with a four-year-minimum mandatory, although technically the judge could waive that requirement.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190509/clermont-man-guilty-of-hit-and-run-fatality?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T13:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748

""The Crazy Water Day"" by Ella Rose Briones

Let me describe a daft water fun day!

The day’s temperature was hot and humid.

My sister said, “Do you want to go play?”

I hopped up and made a pyramid.

“Look out,” screamed my Jack Russell Terrier,

“Yikes, there’s a baby shark on the next street.”

“Oh who cares,” Sis said, “the more the merrier,

but be careful or you’ll be its sweet treat.”

“Run fast, “cried my Husky, “it will get you!”

“No way, I want the excitement,” I said.

But when I saw the shark it just sang pew.

Mom yelled, “You are insane! Go to bed!”

I know this all sounds incredibly crazy.

It really is very surprisingly hazy.

""Yesterday’s Sonnet"" by Abby Lunsford

With paper in hand, I watch the sun rise;

The sun has gone down on my yesterday,

Marking the hardships the past years comprise

As I brush the sadness and pain away.

Looking forth from the past to what’s ahead,

Thinking of all I did and all I’ll do;

Of the things I wanted to do instead,

And all I did despite knowing the truth.

Now at the dawn I begin life again,

So sparkling and fresh, a tender new day.

And all the more as I pick up a pen,

I consider my new sonnet today.

My burdens laid down, I know I can say

I’m glad I let go of my yesterday.

""Misery"" by Vanessa Yunussova

Everyone knows that feeling of despair,

How you feel that you'll be blue forever,

When all you wish to do, is just sit there,

The thought that feeling glee is a never.

This feeling and I have become quite close,

I know this too well to act unconcerned,

Some people have their daily dreary dose,

Feeling that all this pain, they simply earned.

No one enjoys these melancholic thoughts,

Where you feel all empty on the inside,

And you believe all your heart does, is rots,

That joy is lost, regardless if you tried.

The thought that dismal is where you belong,

Fills your heard, but you must be extra strong.

Untitled by Liz Garone

In our youth we do not anticipate

Bliss lost along with ignorance we’ll find

Comes with the end of spring it is innate

Can opened eyes retain an opened mind?

Yet youth is like a flower yet to bloom

Left closed how can it show what is inside?

Left sealed a bud will not know of the room

It had to grow if only it had tried

But as a bud has petals all along

So do our minds with knowledge to be found

Need to taste the fruit called life is not wrong,

But rather the only way we are unbound

So growing up is just a way to bide

The child that we all still have inside.

""Siren Song"" by Thelonious Linford

...and as I floated on the tranquil sea

I came across a strange, small, floating isle

And there one lone young woman sang to me

Her voice stretched out, all men near to beguile

Her skin was soft and fair like brightest snow

Around her head her golden braids did twist

None other did my red heart want to know

Than this fair maiden; salt air and sea kiss’d

But something made her seem more siren like

Perhaps the scaly glint upon her skin

Or yellow teeth each sharpened like a knife

Which shone as her voice tried to draw me in

Thus warned, we set out 'cross the stormy brine

But even now she preys upon my mind

""Sonnet of Beckett"" by Aidan Monroe

To stand before the tyrant of nine kings

Beneath the confines of hallowed comfort,

Thy lord enslaves me through locks without keys

Lest I appeal to his home winter court.

His words will cut through my skin as if swords,

His posture transforms abodes into cells;

And those among him patrol 'bout the ward

directing their demands till I've been felled.

But what grand honors my king provides me:

To groom his fur coat and polish his crown;

Dependence unheard, affections unseen

His love makes this heart dare not let him down.

For never a storm born summer compare

A monster so loyal, brutish and fair.

""Gloriana"" by Bob Ferdinand

(an acrostic sonnet)

England’s great queen, fairest jewel of our isle!

Lady most gracious, whose praises we sing —

Inspire fair-flourishing Nature, while

Zephyrs blow sweetly in earliest Spring.

Abounding in virtue, temp’rate and wise,

Benevolent justice flows from her hands

Ensnaring the wicked, dishonor and lies

To strengthen and prosper all she commands.

Her beauty shines warmly, pure as the sun!

Timeless and radiant, heaven’s true light.

Unrival’d in glory, God’s Chosen One!

Dauntless she rises to take up the fight.

Our love and devotion grow stronger each year,

Renown’d Gloriana — queen without peer.

""One Fair Morn’"" by John Ryan Hall

One fair morn I found me in a forest

Beside a birch I imagined I would form

An arrow from it’s faithful inmost breast

I fancied that I would face the storm

Of those fierce darts that cause me dread

I decided I too would be armed

To strike the little demon of love dead

Only then could I be free from harms

Yet Jove’s imp scorned the image in my mind

And swiftly assigned your eyes to reside

Instead of those arrows only orbs I find

Thus he did all my engines deride

For how can I that deathless boy overcome

When I looked in your eyes and knew you’re the one.

"" Ah, Time Itself doth help us ably age"" by Thomas Robert Moore

(The title is from Line 9, a frequent Shakespearean “transition"")

Whilst young, n’er did I fret ‘bout growing old.

Yet Time doth boldly bring its storms and rain.

So soon learned I, one’s health’s worth more than gold,

As Time deals deftly Aging’s aches and pain.

My eyes and ears do fail me all too fast.

How can I win Life’s fickle flirt with Fate?

Or hope to cope, breathe breaths that long will last?

And find loud laughs, sweet smiles? And not too late?

Ah, Time Itself doth help us ably age:

We find the means o’er time to learn what’s real.

The very limits Life makes us engage,

Do bring near, All we see, hear, smell and feel.

We can embrace whate’er we treasure most.

Then, daily live that love we each hold close.

206,Kendrick Castillo's father says son died saving lives during school shooting,"<p>It was a split-second decision. Kendrick Castillo didn't hesitate. He hurled himself at the gunman who opened fire Tuesday inside a classroom at STEM School Highlands Ranch at Colorado's Douglas County. He is being heralded for his bravery. </p>

<p>Kendrick was at his desk ready for his British Literature class. When he saw Devon Erickson, 18, pull out a handgun, he lunged at him. Students and parents believe the shooting could have been far worse without his courage. </p>

<p>Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said there were eight injured: Five had been released by Wednesday morning but three remained hospitalized in intensive care. Castillo told reporters that he is having a hard time accepting his son's decision.</p>

<p>""I want people to know about him,"" John Castillo <a href=""https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/student-killed-in-stem-school-shooting-identified-as-18-year-old-kendrick-castillo"" target=""_blank"">told ABC News</a> through tears.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Friday would have been the 18-year-old robotics aficionado's last day at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado. The aspiring engineer was planning to go to Arapahoe Community College in the fall. He also had plans to enjoy his love of mechanics, fishing and hunting this summer.</p>

<p>""It doesn't surprise me,"" Kendrick's grieving father said during a Wednesday morning interview with <a href=""https://www.denverpost.com/2019/05/08/kenrick-castillo-victim-stem-shooting-highlands-ranch/"" target=""_blank"">The Denver Post</a>. ""He cared enough about people that he would do something like that ... I wish he had gone and hid, but that's not his character. His character is about protecting people, helping people.""</p>

<p>Nui Giasolli said she saw how Kendrick sacrificed his life to save her and the other students. Kendrick was the only one who died at the school Tuesday. Giasolli said she owed him her life. She said his brave act gave them time to escape. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Kendrick was an award-winning member of the <a href=""http://frc4418.weebly.com/"" target=""_blank"">FRC Team 4418 IMPULSE</a>, his school's varsity robotics team. He spent countless hours at the school's engineering labs working with his teammates. They had competed at the Oklahoma Regionals in March. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, the organizers of the prestigious <a href=""https://www.firstinspires.org/"" target=""_blank"">FIRST Robotics</a> competition released <a href=""https://twitter.com/FIRSTweets/status/1126122827378319362"" target=""_blank"">a tribute on Twitter</a>: ""We are heartbroken by the death of Kendrick Castillo, a victim of the STEM School Highlands Ranch shooting in Littleton, CO. Kendrick was a member of @Frc4418, of which his father is Lead Mentor. Our hearts go out to Kendrick's family, friends, & all affected by the shooting.""</p>

<p>Spurlock said there was a second shooter in another classroom working with Erickson. Sources told ABC News' Denver affiliate that he is a transgender boy who was likely struggling with transitioning. </p>

<p>Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who is running as a Democrat for a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona, and activists with Moms Demand Action also issued statements about Kendrick and Riley Howell, a 21-year-old who also died while tackling a shooter at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte last week. </p>

<p>""The families of Kendrick Castillo and Riley Howell should be planning for their futures, not funerals,"" wrote Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011. ""This is devastating. Our leaders owe it to them to take action."" </p>

<p> </p>

 
 Honoring Kendrick Castillo, 18. He and his classmates were brave enough to bring down one of the Denver shooters. He lost his life and saved countless others.

210,Emergency hearing resumes today for Hillsborough toddler at center of medical custody battle,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Noah McAdams

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - An emergency hearing has been scheduled for 8 a.m. Tuesday morning regarding a Hillsborough toddler at the center of a medical custody battle.

Noah McAdams is currently battling leukemia.

However, his parents do not want him to undergo traditional chemotherapy treatment.

Instead, they want his cancer treated with a more organic approach, one that includes medical-grade cannabis.

Noah has already received two chemo treatments at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, according to family members.

The child's parents, Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball, are now taking their fight to court, hoping the state will allow them to treat their son's cancer using homeopathic methods, not chemotherapy.

The family maintains that's what they were doing when they left Hillsborough County last Monday with their 3-year-old son, sparking a multi-state search. The parents claim they were seeking a second opnion, searching for an alternative to chemo.

The family was eventually found safe in Kentucky.

Authorities put out urgent alerts for Noah, saying the boy was in need of ""lifesaving medical care.""

Hillsborough County deputies said the parents failed to bring their son to a medically-necessary hospital procedure last week, then refused to follow up with additional lifesaving medical care.

""We just want of the therapies less drastic than chemotherapy,"" Noah's mother said.

The parents have temporarily lost custody of their son and now he's staying with his grandparents.

""These parents are absolutely not looking to let their kid suffer, they're going to treat this child,"" said Michael Minardi, the attorney representing Noah's parents.

The couple tells News Channel 8 they absolutely do not want chemotherapy for their child, insisting that other treatments be considered.

""I want my son home and for him to be treated with a treatment that is not going to damage his little body so much,"" said Noah's mom.

The parents want to use medical cannabis, CBD oils, vitamins and a strict diet to treat Noah's cancer.

The couple tells us they're not opposed to treatment, they just want to do it differently.

""We want him to be treated with something that has less side effects,"" Noah's mother said. ""Chemotherapy is so brutal on a body.""

On Tuesday after the court hearing , Noah's mom said her son is stressed out since he is separated from them.

""As of yesterday you can tell that he is severely traumatized by all of this, by being separated from us. He has never been separated from us this long and been restricted to when he can and cannot see his parents,"" said Taylor Bland-Ball, mother.

Since no decision was reached on Tuesday, she is hopeful the family still has a chance to get what they want.

""I am really thankful that the judge didn't make a decision today. That she is allowing more witnesses to come in, that she is allowing more information to be exposed about this treatment, said Bland-Ball.

The hearing resumes at 8 a.m. Wednesday.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/emergency-hearing-resumes-today-for-hillsborough-toddler-at-center-of-medical-custody-battle/1988311726,2019-05-08T08:44:49Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
211,Josh the Otter imparts swimming safety lesson in Flagler,"Josh the Otter, a child-friendly advocate for swimming safety, visited Wadsworth Elementary recently thanks to a group dedicated to saving young lives.

Walking between buildings on the campus of Wadsworth Elementary School, Josh the Otter had to pass by the playground and dozens of students engaged in a variety of activities.

The effect was immediate. Children abandoned their games and ran to greet the six-foot-plus fluffy celebrity, throwing their arms about him and shouting with delight.

Josh — really Flagler Palm Coast High School student William Vierengel in costume — gave out high-fives and hugs and, with finesse and the help of his associates, eventually completed the journey to the school’s gymnasium.

There he met with a large group of second-graders to share a message about swimming safety. Delivered by such a celebrity, it was a message the children are unlikely to forget. And that, William and his allies hope, will save young lives.

Josh’s visit was arranged by Brielle Goldberg, a local advocate for water safety, and a group of teens in FPC’s Community Problem Solving program. Their project, FLOATS — Fun Learning Opportunities for All To Swim — shares the goal of a similar effort by Goldberg when she was a student in the program: curb the number of childhood drownings in the county and the state.

[READ ALSO: Students seek to stop childhood drownings]

In addition to William, the FLOATS team includes Kolbie Adams, Anniel Buchanan, Diego Carrascosa, Cayla Joseph, Riley Kuiper, Morgan Mitchell, Michael Mwaura and Desiree Ruiz. Most members were able to join Josh and Goldberg for the presentations at Wadsworth.

A key element of the FLOATS project is to encourage kids to take swim lessons.

“It’s better to learn how to swim from a younger age,” said Michael, in explaining the value of introducing the subject to children in voluntary pre-kindergarten through second grade.

During the presentations, Goldberg spoke to the children about staying near their parents while swimming and an app they can get for free to use on any tablet or smart phone.

“It has tons of great information for children,” she said. “You can read the Josh the Otter book, sing the song, make a water safety pledge, which we’ve had all the kids do today so far. There’s a water safety quiz and they can color. So, it’s a great way for kids to learn something.”

“Living in Florida, it’s important that our young students understand water safety,” said Wadsworth Principal Anna Crawford. “You just never know when that could save a life, so that is very, very important to me.”

She said she was grateful to have the team visit her school.

Josh the Otter is part of an outreach of the Joshua Collingsworth Memorial Foundation, named for a young Nebraska boy who drowned in 2008. Goldberg and another swim instructor purchased the costume for their own local outreach.

Goldberg is director of WaterSafe, a Flagler County initiative that conducts annual events promoting water rescue, pool safety, infant swim lessons and more.

212,Adopted son of Jerry Sandusky wants to help child abuse survivors,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - It's a name you don't hear often in the news anymore, but one that's hard to forget: Jerry Sandusky. The former Penn State assistant football coach is serving up to 60 years in prison on child sex abuse charges. He still says he's innocent, but one of his sons -- Matt Sandusky -- insists he's not.

Matt spoke with News4Jax anchor Staci Spanos while he was in town speaking to Jacksonville's Exchange Club. He talked about how he was adopted by Jerry and now travels the country talking about what he said Jerry did to him.

Matt wants others to hear his story, learn from it, and heal from any abuse they may have experienced -- just like he's healing.

""The very first memory I have I was about 3 years old. I was sitting on the edge of a bed. My biological dad was sitting beside me, my mother and my grandfather were pounding on the door trying to get in. What my dad was doing was burning my toes with a cigarette lighter,"" Matt explained while speaking recently at Jacksonville's Exchange Club .

Matt said that difficult start to his life primed him to be the perfect prey. Matt claims he fell victim to his predator, Jerry Sandusky -- whom he met as a troubled youth.

Jerry would go on to be his foster father and ultimately his adoptive dad. During his Jacksonville speaking engagement, Matt said that the abuse started with a simple but sinister grooming process when Sandusky picked him up one day to watch a football game.

""I got into the car, shut the door and he put his hand on my left knee. He didn't squeeze my knee, he didn't move it, he didn't ask anything about it. I just knew it made me super uncomfortable as a 9-year-old boy, but as I would do many times over the years, I told myself it felt weird because it wasn't natural to me,"" Matt explained.

When Staci asked Matt what kind of guy Jerry Sandusky was, he told her, ""90 percent of the time that I spent with him and the Sandusky family was everything that I wish every single child would have in their lives.""

""That's very hard for people to understand because they seem to be this great person and behind closed doors they're a monster,"" Staci followed up.

""Yeah, and that's how society wants to reckon with these issues,"" Matt said. ""We want to paint the people that do these crimes, these heinous monsters. It's hard when we have to justify and come to the realization that they are parents they are coaches, they are loved ones in the child's life, in our lives, they're friends of ours and that's hard for us to grasp and why we still have a hard time dealing with this issue.""

Staci Spanos also spoke with child safety expert Stacy Pendarvis, who implements safety programs in schools across the country. Pendarvis said one statistic shows 95 percent of sexual abuse is preventable through education -- and that education needs to start at home.

""So I always tell parents start today. All a parent needs to do is say I saw a story on the news today about sexual abuse, I want to have a conversation about it. It's a perfect introduction even if you've never had a conversation with your child. And then every opportunity you can get, talk about it,"" Pendarvis suggested.

Matt said no one was there to talk to him about what was acceptable behavior, and subsequently, he said Jerry Sandusky abused him for years.

When Jerry Sandusky was brought to trial in 2012 on dozens of charges of child sexual abuse involving 10 victims, Matt -- at least outwardly -- appeared to support Sandusky.

""I didn't stick by him,"" Matt stated. ""I need people to understand that I was protecting myself. This was the biggest secret I had in my life. I didn't want anybody to know what he had ever done to me and what he had forced me to do to him.""

""For 20 years, every single day, all I could think about was making sure no one found out what ever happened to me,"" he explained.

Matt said he has severed ties with the Sandusky family, including Dottie Sandusky -- Jerry's wife, and the woman he once considered his adoptive mother. None of the Sandusky siblings support him, and one of them, Jeff Sandusky, is serving up to 7 years in prison for pleading guilty for child sex abuse charges.

Matt has since founded the Peaceful Hearts Foundation, dedicated to the healing of sexual abuse survivors. And he has a message for anyone who is suffering the trauma of abuse.

""Number one, I would say you're not alone. Number two, I would say it wasn't your fault, you're not to blame for any part of it. Number 3 is you are loved. You are deserving of love. And number 4 is you can heal from this, you will heal from this.""

213,New wonder drug could cure a horrible disease – for $2 million per treatment,"A new wonder drug is coming for babies with a crippling, often fatal disease. Expected price tag: $2 million per treatment, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Novartis AG is expected to begin selling Zolgensma, a possible cure for spinal muscular atrophy, after the FDA approves it this month. Novartis executives say Zolgensma’s ability to curb SMA—a muscle-wasting disease that often kills babies before age 2—explains the eye-popping price.

But it is controversial: “A therapy is useless if no one can afford it,” says a health-insurance industry spokeswoman.

Insurance companies are also uneasy about paying for a purported cure when no one knows about the long-term effects. After all, Zolgenma’s first clinical trial just happened five years ago.

Zolgensma is one of several new gene-therapy drugs that target a faulty gene behind a horrible illness. The only other US-approved gene therapy, Luxturna, costs $850,000 and helps children with a rare eye condition, per the Journal. Others include “bubble-boy disease” drug Strimvelis ($663,000) and leukemia drug Kymriah ($475,000).

What’s more, Bloomberg reports that Zolgensma seems to help a wider group of patients whose motor function is slowly ruined by SMA. But parents are bracing for a battle if the insurance industry balks at the price.

“It’ll be a big fight,” says Louisiana resident Andrea James, whose infant son is already taking spinal injections for SMA. Zolgensma’s actual price is yet to be announced, and the $2 million figure is just an estimate – it could go as high as $5 million.

214,"After regular Baker Act committals, treatment program helps Naples teen","Caleb Caldwell’s delicate peace with himself wavered earlier this year when a violent outburst nearly led to a mental health evaluation under Florida’s Baker Act — yet again.

The 19-year-old from Naples had skipped some of the medications he takes to treat symptoms of his bipolar disorder and got into an argument with his mother and brother.

“He was being very violent. And he did put his hands on me,” said his mother, Mellisa Caldwell. “He just gets really out of hand. He does. And he’s a big guy.”

But given the troubles of Caleb’s life, the fact this lapse was not worse is something of a victory.

Caleb, an otherwise soft-spoken young man who finally landed a paying job and hopes to work in sports medicine, spent most of his early and mid-adolescence in and out of mental health crisis units.

It was before his condition had been fully diagnosed, and his prescribed medication was wanting.

He was bullied. He had violent outbursts at home and at school. He regularly threatened suicide. And at one point, he was getting committed under the Baker Act nearly every other week.

The boy’s troubling behavior, his later mood swings and propensity to violence — seemingly without remorse — even prompted one psychiatrist to tell the Naples family that the boy had “sociopathic criminal potential.”

So much happened, and so much of it seems like a blur to Caleb.

“A lot of this has been going on for so long that I don’t remember a lot,” Caleb said.

Then, when he was 16, after one of his threats to kill himself and another Baker Act evaluation at the David Lawrence Center in East Naples, real progress: a new diagnosis and treatment plan that seemed to better address his behavior problems.

It turns out that Caleb, now 19, was on the autism spectrum, something multiple mental health professionals he encountered failed to notice, according to his family. He got different medications and found a mental health counselor who is helping him control his impulses.

He soon got an internship with the NCH Baker Downtown Hospital as part of the Project SEARCH program, which helps find jobs for teens and young adults with developmental disabilities.

Before his last behavioral lapse — the first serious one in years — Caleb said he hoped those days were behind him.

“There are times when I have some issues, but it doesn’t get to that point anymore,” he said.

But the family knows there will never be a treatment silver bullet. Caleb's problems will never just go away.

They consider themselves lucky because of the help from the David Lawrence Center and that they have the means to aggressively work to find him treatment. But they worry about Caleb's future.

He is transitioning into the working world. He still lives with his parents, but if he is committed under the Baker Act again, now as an adult, law enforcement officers would not be required to contact them.

Mellisa Caldwell is trying to establish legal guardianship of him into adulthood. Caleb isn't quite sure what he thinks about that.

“I feel like there are times that I need it,"" he said. ""But I think there are times when I need my own space and think I’m fine on my own. But I do think there are times — like when I get Baker Acted – what would I have done if she wasn’t there?""

216,Meghan Markle and 7 other American princesses who had a royal baby,"CLOSE With the birth of Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's royal baby, enjoy looking back at these historic royal births, from the 1940s to today. USA TODAY

Nearly a year after her wedding to Prince Harry, the Duchess Meghan of Sussex gave birth to her first child. Buckingham Palace said the boy arrived early this morning, weighing 7 pounds and 3 ounces.

A statement said the family, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Prince William and Duchess Kate and Harry's maternal aunts and uncle, have all been informed and ""are delighted with the news.""

The Duchess, better known as Meghan Markle, was born and raised in Los Angeles. Her newborn son is now seventh in line for the throne, right behind his father, Harry. The child is also the first ever mixed-race baby born into the royal family.

That said, the baby is not the first royal with an American mother.

Rita Hayworth

The actress was best known for her roles in films like ""Gilda"" and ""The Lady from Shanghai"" in the 1940s. But in 1949, Rita Hayworth left Hollywood behind to marry Prince Aly Khan, son of the leader of Nizārī Ismaili Muslims. She met him a year prior at the Cannes Film Festival.

They had both been married before, Khan once before and Hayworth twice, most recently to Orson Welles in a marriage that lasted from 1943 to 1947.

She gave birth to a daughter at the end of 1949, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan. Hayworth had previously given birth to another daughter fathered by Orson Welles. Her marriage to either child's father did not last.

Hayworth brought her daughter with her to Nevada to establish residency in order to qualify for a divorce, later saying there were threats against the child's life if the girl was not raised Muslim, according to a 1953 newspaper clipping. Hayworth said she wanted the child raised Christian.

The couple eventually divorced in 1953 but their daughter became her mother's caretaker as she suffered through Alzheimer's toward the end of her life.

Grace Kelly

Another Hollywood actress left behind a successful career in the 1950s after appearing in films like ""Rear Window"" and ""Dial M for Murder."" Grace Kelly also met her future husband at the Cannes Film Festival.

After a year-long courtship, Kelly married Rainer III, Prince of Monaco in 1956. The wedding was televised to an audience of an estimated 30 million viewers, according to the book ""Planet Wedding.""

As Princess of Monaco, she gave birth to three children: Princess Caroline in 1957, Prince Albert in 1958 and Princess Stéphanie in 1965. Albert is the current reigning monarch of Monaco, the second-smallest country in the world after the Vatican.

Kelly died in 1982 in a car crash after suffering a stroke while driving with Stéphanie in the car. Her daughter survived the crash.

The sister of First Lady Jackie Kennedy, Radziwill divorced another American, Michael Temple Canfield before marrying Polish Prince Stanisław Albrecht ""Stash"" Radziwiłł in 1959. The prince also divorced his second wife in order to wed the American socialite.

Her title became ""Her Serene Highness Princess Caroline Radziwill,"" and she gave birth to a boy, Anthony, in 1959 and a daughter, Anna Christina, in 1960. Neither made a career out of being a royal.

Hope Cooke

Born in San Francisco, Hope Cooke traveled to India while a freshman at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959. There, she met Palden Thondup Namgyal, the Crown Prince of Sikhism. He had two children, was nearly twice her age, and a widower, but in 1963, the two wed.

The marriage required Cooke to renounce her U.S. citizenship. She became Queen of Sikhism, giving birth to two children, Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. She was also a step-mother to her husband's other three children.

But political conflict with the nation of India ultimately led to the kingdom coming to an end in the 1970s. Cooke then traveled back to the U.S. with her two children, according to The New York Times. She was granted permanent residency in the U.S and later, divorced Mamgyal.

Lisa Halaby

Years after her grandfather immigrated to the U.S. from Syria, Halaby returned to the Middle East in the 1970s, meeting Hussein bin Talal, the King of Jordan. The two married in 1978, the King's fourth and final marriage.

Halaby took the royal name Noor Al-Hussein and converted to Islam. As Queen, she was step-mother to three of the King's children and gave birth to four more in the royal line:

Prince Hamzah in 1980, Prince Hashim in 1981, Princess Iman in 1983 and Princess Raiyah in 1986. Hamzah was Crown Prince of Jordan between 1999 to 2004 until his half-brother, King Abdullah II, removed him from the position. Abdullah has been King of the country since his father's death in 1999.

217,Royal baby birth! Who is next in line to the British throne?,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

LONDON (WFLA) - Royal watchers have been waiting for the birth of the newest royal. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex gave birth to their first child a boy at 5:26 a.m. London time 12:26 a.m. Eastern Standard time.

The new baby is seventh in line to the British throne, behind grandfather Prince Charles, uncle Prince William, three cousins, George, Charlotte and Louis, and father Prince Harry.

The UK's Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan Markle announced she was pregnant in October. And while it’s unlikely that Prince Harry or his child will ever be king, their family life will be royal.

Interestingly, baby Sussex will not automatically be a prince or princess, unlike the cousins, who were designated as his or her royal highness and given the title of prince or princess. The baby's great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, can step in to give him or her that title.

So who is in the line of succession to the British throne after Queen Elizabeth II?

Until Duchess Kate's first pregnancy, the rules of succession favored male heirs, so a younger brother would jump ahead of an elder sister in the line for the throne. But the rules were changed before Prince George was born to give royal daughters the same rights as sons. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 states that succession to the throne would be based on birth order, not gender.

That means Princess Charlotte will remain fourth in line to the throne, and Prince Louis will be fifth.

William's younger brother, Prince Harry, is sixth in line and baby sussex becomes seventh.

But who fills in the rest of the gaps? Here's a look at the long line of royals waiting to take their spot.",http://www.wfla.com/news/world/royal-baby-birth-who-is-next-in-line-to-the-british-throne-/1964063957,2019-05-06T13:53:35Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

(Photo: TIM SHORTT/FLORIDA TODAY)

Waiting any amount of time for a needed organ can feel like a lifetime for patients and their families.

According to Donate Life America, more than 110,000 adults and children in the U.S. are awaiting organ transplants and another person is added to the transplant waiting list every 10 minutes.

Not all are able to receive organs in time, with 8,000 people dying each year, or 22 people each day, because the organs they need are not donated in time.

The need for organs stretches across demographics, with all races, ethnicities and age groups represented on the waitlist.

Infant gets a liver transplant

Rayna Kamon, 10, of Satellite Beach was just 2 months old when her parents, both medical professionals, realized something was wrong.

After a series of tests, the baby was diagnosed with biliary atresia, a rare disease that affects the drainage of bile from the liver in infants.

A surgery to fix the disease was unsuccessful. Five months after the diagnosis, Rayna was placed on a liver transplant list. Given her age and size, the pool of potential liver donors was small.

“Both her father and I worked with organ procurement agencies in our careers prior to having Rayna and always knew how special organ donation was,"" said Corrinne Kamon, Rayna’s mother. ""But being on the recipient side was eye opening.""

Just 11 days after being placed on the waitlist, the family received word that a potential donor liver could be a match. Seven-month-old Rayna was in surgery less than 24 hours later at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami.

“We were elated that she was going to have a chance at life but also extremely sad and distraught over knowing another child was gone and that the family was grieving,” Corrinne Kamon said. “We will always be in debt for the gift of life they gave at their darkest hour.”

Today, Rayna is a healthy 10-year-old with no obvious signs that she underwent such a life-altering experience as a baby. She speaks matter-of-factly of the surgery and of her belief that organ donation is the right choice.

“It’s so easy to register as an organ donor,” Rayna said.

The privacy of the donor is respected in transplant cases so it is common that recipients never learn the donor identities.

“We know that Rayna’s liver came from a 2-year-old boy in Georgia. I looked up news stories from around that time but have never been able to definitively figure out who her donor was,” Corrinne Kamon said.

Each year on the anniversary of Rayna’s transplant, she and her loved ones celebrate “liver day,” taking time to give thanks to the family of the donor.

“I try to think about that little boy and his family,"" Rayna said. ""I want them to know how thankful I am that I have life.""

Cancer survivor gets needed liver

Tom Stokes, 70, of Melbourne will celebrate the second anniversary of his liver transplant in July.

His need for a new liver stemmed from a case of hepatitis that was discovered after he donated blood in the early 1990s. Stokes treated the disease for 20 years and eventually developed liver cancer.

“I drank my last alcoholic drink in October of 2015. I was a moderate drinker, usually a beer or wine with friends,"" Stokes said. ""But I knew that if I was to ask for the gift of a new liver, I needed to commit to keeping it healthy.""

Already a runner, Stokes bumped up his fitness routine and added multi-sport components in an attempt to get his body in the best shape possible to withstand a likely liver transplant surgery and recovery.

Tom Stokes, 70, of Melbourne will celebrate the second anniversary of his liver transplant in July 2019. (Photo: Provided)

In May of 2017, Stokes was officially added to the liver transplant list. Two months later, he received a call that he had been placed with a liver.

“I had completed a sprint triathlon that same morning. I showered and went to bed,"" Stokes recalled. ""Around 10:30 p.m. I got a call saying they had a liver for me that I needed to go right away.""

Stokes immediately went to the Transplant Institute at Advent Health in Orlando to prep for surgery. His wife, Deb Stokes, was visiting family out of state and hopped on the first flight she could find home.

The surgery lasted five hours and was completed without any complications.

For Stokes, the liver transplant sparked an even greater desire to push the limits of his healthy body, despite physician warnings that he may never be “100 percent” again.

“That really irked me when I was told that,” Stokes said. “I thought, well, what do you know? I’ll get back to better than 100 percent.”

Inspired to surpass expectations, he ran the Tailgate 2-miler race just six weeks after his surgery. In November of 2017, he ran the Space Coast Marathon relay, splitting the marathon course with his wife.

“At no point in my transplant journey was I afraid of dying,"" Stokes said. ""My biggest fear was losing the active lifestyle my wife and I had. I wanted to get back to it just as soon as I could.""

Today the couple is back to their normal routine, running and cycling with local groups several days a week and racing in some capacity nearly every weekend. Tom Stokes runs faster than he did pre-transplant. Both are advocates for organ donation.

“As sad as the circumstances typically are surrounding an untimely death, you can’t take it with you,” Tom Stokes said. “And what a gift of life to give to another family.”

Like the Kamons, Tom Stokes does not know the identity of his donor.

“I know he was younger than me at the time of the surgery but that is about all I know,” he said. “But I am forever thankful that he was an organ donor or that his family made that decision.”

Warning: Details in this article are disturbing and may be upsetting to readersVideo that police recovered from an Illinois woman’s cellphone showing her bruised 5-year-old son prompted the boy’s father to lead investigators to the child’s body, according to newly released court records.JoAnn Cunningham and Andrew Freund Sr. of Crystal Lake are charged with murder in Andrew “AJ” Freund’s death. Investigators found his body April 24. The court records offer details about the investigation into the boy’s disappearance and death.The video, dated March 4, shows AJ lying naked on a mattress, covered in bruises and bandages, according to an affidavit from McHenry County Sheriff’s Detective Edwin Maldonado. Freund told investigators his role in AJ’s death when they confronted him with the video, which police recovered after it had been deleted from Cunningham’s phone. Maldonado wrote that a female voice “consistent with Joann’s is holding the phone and videotaping. She is berating AJ for urinating his bed.”Freund led police to the boy’s body near Woodstock, wrapped in plastic and buried in a shallow grave covered with straw, records show. Cunningham and Freund had reported AJ missing April 18, three days after he died.According to the affidavit, the parents forced AJ to take a cold shower April 14 as punishment for lying about soiling his underwear.“Drew explained that he wanted JoAnn to stop with the hard physical beatings and do some less violent form of punishment,” Maldonado wrote. “Drew said cold showers was decided.”Freund told investigators they put the boy to bed “cold, wet and naked” and Cunningham later found him unresponsive. Freund said he put AJ’s body in a plastic container and stored it in the basement before later burying him. An autopsy found AJ died from multiple blunt force injuries to his head.The warrant also showed a search on Freund’s cellphone for “child CPR” and a picture of a shopping list that included “duct tape, plastic gloves, air freshener and bleach.”Cunningham, 36, and Freund, 60, are due in court May 10 for a preliminary hearing. They’re being held in the McHenry County Jail on $5 million bond each. Court records do not list an attorney for Freund who could be reached for comment on his behalf.

222,Teacher disciplined for telling students to give boy birthday punches,"A boy suffered bruises on his arm as a result of receiving ""birthday punches"" at school, officials said.

PORT ORANGE, Fla. - A middle school teacher who told his students to give one of their classmates ""birthday punches"" is being punished for his behavior, according to documents from Volusia County Schools.

The boy's father contacted Creekside Middle School administrators on March 7, saying that his son had been repeatedly punched in the locker room the day before as he was preparing to leave gym class.

The child said coach Devin Johnson told the students that it was the boy's birthday and they needed to give him ""birthday punches."" The boy suffered bruises on his arm as a result of the incident, the report said.

Students who were in the class and another physical education teacher were interviewed as part of the claims. Everyone except the other teacher, who was not present when the incident began and only saw the boy being punched, said that Johnson told the students the punch the boy for his birthday.

Johnson was put on leave after the incident was reported.

Multiple teachers and a parent wrote to school officials in support of Johnson. They described him as dedicated educator with a knack for connecting with his students. In their letters, they cited examples of Johnson's passion for his work and his willingness to go above and beyond for the student body.

Students also started a Change.org petition in support of Johnson.

On April 1, Johnson received a letter notifying him that he would need to take a course that provides workplace professionalism training by May 30.

223,9-year-old Cocoa Beach boy has close encounter with gator while running track,"(WESH) - A 9-year-old boy had a close encounter with an alligator while he was running track Thursday at an elementary school in Cocoa Beach, Florida.

Freedom Seven Elementary school student Trent Johnson saw something that looked a little curious while he was running around the track.

""It kinda just looked like a gray blob in the corner,"" Trent said. ""The closest I got was probably two to three feet,"" he said.

Trent told his coach, and the school immediately closed the track and made sure no students could get near the alligator. Police and a state-licensed trapper made sure nobody was hurt.

The gator likely wandered to the track from a retention pond nearby.

The pond is securely fenced, but alligators can climb.

226,"Elmer Tremont, Fort Myers and Cypress Lake High coaching icon, dies at 89","Fort Myers High School girls basketball coach Elmer Tremont watches intently from the sidelines as his team battles it out during a close game with Cypress Lake at Fort Myers in 2002. (Photo: news-press.com file photo)

Elmer Tremont, an area coaching icon, a man who coached and won more games of any kind than anyone in Lee County high school athletics history, reclined in a chair to watch an NBA playoff game Thursday night at his daughter’s home in Lithia. He fell asleep and never woke up.

Tremont, a record-setting punter at the University of Miami and a high school boys and girls basketball and football coach for more than 50 years in Fort Myers, died at the age of 89, sometime in the early hours of Friday morning. He would have turned 90 on Nov. 28.

“There were so many layers to his career,” said Sam Sirianni Jr., whose father’s iconic, 33-year varsity football coaching career overlapped with Tremont’s in basketball.

Tremont won 732 games in football, volleyball and boys and girls basketball over 54 years, all in Lee County. Many of those victories came at Cypress Lake in basketball, as he led the Panthers boys teams often to the state playoffs and even to the state’s final four in 1982.

In 1986, Dave LaRosa first met Tremont after arriving to Cypress Lake from West Virginia as a young teacher and future principal.

“One of the things you could always tell, without even knowing Coach Tremont, you knew from seeing him interacting with other people,” LaRosa said. “When he appeared somewhere, he turned people to him. You could always tell when somebody has a great amount of influence. He always had the ability to do that. Being young and new to the area and not knowing anything about him, I saw that right away. I knew that this guy was something. It didn’t take me long to understand the significance of him.”

Tremont began his coaching career in the 1950s at Fort Myers High after serving for two years as a medic for the U.S. Army in the Korean War.

Born Nov. 28, 1929, Tremont grew up in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. He and his wife Betty Jo, 88, had three children: Linda, Joanne and Teresa.

Linda died from cancer, and Teresa died in a drowning accident, in which her father found her in their home pool two years ago.

“He never really recovered from that,” Joanne Tremont said. The past four months especially have been rough on Elmer Tremont and his wife.

Family and friends are focusing on the joy and the discipline he gave to more than two generations of Lee County student-athletes.

“He was a great coach, and he was also a very good friend,” said Tim Lewis, 75, who played football and basketball for Tremont during the 1950s at Fort Myers High. “He was kind of like a father. I was very close to him. I’m going to miss him very much. He did more for Lee County than anybody, boys and girls, because he coached both.

“He had a lot to do with my life. He was a mean son of a gun. He kicked me off the basketball team in 1959. The whole season, my sophomore year. He did what was right, and I did what was wrong. I don’t remember nothing, but I can remember that.”

Tremont lorded over his 1970s teams as an authoritarian figure, albeit a beloved one.

""Ah, rule No. 1 is that Coach is always right,"" Cypress Lake basketball player Calvin Harrison told The News-Press in 1977, as Tremont glared at him to give the right answer. ""Rule No. 2 is to refer to No. 1 when in doubt what to do.""

The desire for warm weather led Tremont to Lee County by way of the University of Miami. He still holds the Gator Bowl record for punting, averaging 44.5 yards on nine punts, set in 1952 during a 14-0 victory against Clemson.

“He finished high school, and then he got recruited by many schools,” Joanne Tremont said. “A punter and a defensive back. But he chose Miami. He was from the north, and he wanted the warmth and the beaches and everything he never had before. He never traveled much.”

Joanne said she was the “boy of the family,” as she often tagged along with her dad to basketball practices.

“He was like a superhero to me,” she said. “I was proud of him. He was very, very serious about doing the best that he could for the youth of Lee County. When he was at Cypress Lake, he said he never worked a day in his life. He truly loved working with the kids and coaching. He had this drive. Believe me, I know. I don’t play games anymore with people. I’m too competitive. It was in our blood. If you don’t think you can win, then don’t play. That’s just his mentality.”

In the late 1980s, ‘90s and 2000s, Elmer Tremont often “retired” from coaching, only to unretire and resurface at other schools: Estero, where he helped establish the school’s athletic programs in 1987, Fort Myers during the 1990s and as an assistant girls coach at Bishop Verot and Fort Myers during the 2000s.

“Every time he retired, I’d get a new job, and I’d bring him back,” said James Browder, former Lee County superintendent and principal at Estero, Cypress Lake and Fort Myers high schools. “He’s the best basketball coach anywhere. He put every program that I’d put him into that was in disarray and get that program going again. He did it at Cypress. He did it at Fort Myers. He’ll do it in heaven now.”

Tremont leaves a legacy beyond coaching. Twenty-two years ago, he and his friend Monk Hillmyer established the Hillmyer-Tremont Foundation. It held its annual banquet Monday night and awarded three more scholarships, bringing the 22-year total to $1.8 million in scholarship money for local student-athletes.

“Monk Hillmyer was a big business leader, and coach Tremont was the coach,” said Sam Crimaldi, who helps run the foundation. Hillmyer died in 2008. “They were best friends. They went to the Final Four together. They focused not only on their jobs but the greater good of the community.”

Funeral services for Elmer Tremont are slated for 11 a.m. Tuesday, May 21, at Church of the Resurrection of our Lord, at 8121 Cypress Lake Drive, in Fort Myers.

“We had a lot of fun,” said pastor Ed McNamara, who will do the service and has known Elmer Tremont since 1972. “It was just a fun relationship with him. He was just an all-around guy, loved by everyone who ever met him.”

Cypress Lake High School named its gymnasium after Tremont in 1996 and rededicated it to him in 2006 when it was rebuilt following its 2004 destruction by Hurricane Charley.

The Lee County School Athletic Conference Hall of Fame inducted Tremont in 2013.

The Florida Athletic Coaches Association inducted Tremont into its Hall of Fame in 1984. The Florida High School Athletic Association so far has denied Tremont a spot in its hall of fame, an omission LaRosa hopes to someday change.

Sirianni and LaRosa each said Tremont’s career victory mark and long tenure never would be matched.

“Think about that,” Sirianni said. “Fifty years in one community. In today’s structure, the way high school sports and club sports and all the social media, it’s very hard to believe that somebody could coach for that long. You’re talking about just a handful of people who can leave that kind of legacy. He gave back with his foundation. Elmer Tremont, he’s got to go down as one of the legends.”

227,Why Meghan Markle and Prince Harry won't announce their royal baby's name right away,"Advertisement Why Meghan Markle and Prince Harry won't announce their royal baby's name right away If Duke and Duchess take William and Kate's lead, they'll keep us guessing for a few days Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's baby is here — but still, we know next to nothing about the new royal except that he weighs 7 pounds and 3 ounces. As for his name, it likely won't be announced for a few days, at least. And since the royals often repeat history, here's a timeline of when the names of the last three royal babies were announced.Prince George's name was announced on Twitter two days after he was born.Keeping to tradition, they announced Princess Charlotte's name two days after she was born.The third time around, the royals waited four full days before announcing Prince Louis' name. Think that's bad? Prince Charles and Princess Diana announced Prince William's name one week after he was born. Even worse, the Queen didn't publicly share Prince Charles' name until a full month after he was born. Prince Harry's name, on the other hand, was shared just 24 hours after his birth. So, that means it could take anywhere from 24 hours to 30 days for the name to be revealed. While it may just seem dramatic to the rest of us, it's actually quite customary for the royals. ""On one hand there's a desire to inform the families before a public declaration is made and any new parent appreciates having a little private time to get to know their new addition before the onslaught of announcements,"" commenter Victoria Arbiter told Town & Country.It also doesn't help that everyone is watching/waiting/betting on the name that the couple picks. ""Royals, however, also have to consider the great responsibility in naming a new member of the family and I expect they want to be a hundred percent certain of their choice before announcing the name and sealing the baby's place in history,"" she continued. Per tradition, it's likely that the name will have some close ties to Prince Harry's mom and dad, Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana. As of right now, top picks for a boy include Arthur, James, Albert, Spencer, Henry, Philip, Charles and Alexander. One thing we know for sure: The baby won't have a prince title, unless the Queen changes the rules like she did for Kate and William's children. Since 1917, there has been an order set in place by George V, the great-great grandfather of Prince Harry, that limits titles in the British royal family. If they adhere to these orders, Harry and Meghan's oldest son would have the title Earl of Dumbarton, a title given to Harry on his wedding day.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-baby-name-announced/27374112,2019-05-06T15:10:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
229,Number of Polk students taken into custody for disruptions increasing,"Lakeland Police saw one of the largest percentage increases in arrests, going from no arrests in 2014 through 2017, to 14 last year.

LAKELAND — In December, Haines City School Resource Officer Daniel Hicks responded to Eastside Elementary School, where a student, already enrolled in a behavioral turnaround program, had flipped over a table and chairs, threw papers on the floor and cussed at his teacher because he had been told to complete his assignment or he would lose a privilege to play basketball.

“I don't care about going to jail — my teacher is crazy,” the boy allegedly told School Principal Lorine Smith when she arrived to calm the boy.

Another student in the room had to be removed for their own safety.

Hicks gave the boy one final chance to pick up the table, chairs and papers, but he refused and told Hicks he did not like his teacher, Terry Benton, and did not care about what would happen to him. Hicks placed him in custody. The boy was already in a diversion program for a weapons charge, so Hicks took him to the Haines City Police Department for processing and then transported him to the Juvenile Assessment Center in Bartow.

The boy was one of eight juveniles arrested in Haines City last year for disrupting a school function, a misdemeanor. Three students have already been arrested this year for the same charge, records from Haines City Police show.

It is a charge that has seen a great increase in the last year in the number of students arrested or sent to a diversion program. It is a possible unintended consequence of The Marjory Stoneman Douglas Act, passed last year following the horrific shooting of 17 people at the Parkland, Florida, high school. The law requires a tougher stance on disruptions at schools and additional mental health help for struggling students.

“Since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas event, words matter,” said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. “If you say you're going to blow up a school, if you say you're going to kill a teacher, if you say you're going to kill a student, we know statistically that's childish talk, but we are no longer at the mercy of guessing what's in your mind.”

But Judd cautioned that not all students taken into custody are officially arrested, charged with this misdemeanor and then taken to juvenile detention.

“There's arrests and there's pre-diversion arrests — everybody we take to the Juvenile Assessment Center for what I call the 'therapeutic ride' don't all go into the arrest portal,” Judd said. “Some go into the pre-arrest diversion program.”

Schools Superintendent Jacqueline Byrd declined to comment for this story, but school district spokeswoman Rachel Pleasant said the district is not responsible for the arrests, adding that they defer to law enforcement judgment and authority in determining when a child is taken into custody.

“The decision and power to make an arrest lies with law enforcement, not the school district,” Pleasant said. “We work closely with our law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of our students and schools.”

Arrest makes national news

One of the arrests this year made national news, when a Lawton Chiles Middle Academy sixth-grader was questioned by a substitute teacher about his refusal to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. The situation escalated, a school dean was called and the school resource officer accompanied the dean to the classroom. The student had a meltdown when he was asked to leave the classroom, saying it was the substitute who should leave because she was racist.

The principal had planned to send the students home with his mother when she arrived at school. Instead, the SRO made the decision to place him into custody and send him to the Juvenile Assessment Center in Bartow, where he was placed in what's known as a pre-arrest diversion program — also called Teen Court. Students qualify for Teen Court only if they have no prior record with law enforcement. If they complete the program successfully, the incident will be removed from their record.

Of the Polk County Sheriff's Office; Lakeland, Winter Haven, Lake Wales and Haines City police departments, Lakeland Police saw one of the largest percentage increases in arrests, going from no arrests in 2014 through 2017, to 14 last year. In addition, they went from sending no students to a diversion program from 2013-2016, and three in 2017, to sending 11 students last year.

Lakeland Police Department spokesman Gary Gross said the department's school resource officers have already made five arrests this year, along with sending seven juveniles to Teen Court.

There's been “more of a presence (on campuses) since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018,” said Gross, adding that law enforcement “investigates all threats and any acts that may create a disruption at the school.”

Those threats include anything from a fistfight to a bomb threat to an outright threat to kill someone.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office arrested the same number of students as Lakeland Police, with 14. But it had 44 students in 2018 sent to Teen Court, which was up from 10 in 2017. The PCSO, which services a larger area than any of the police departments, saw the largest increase in sending students to Teen Court.

Scott Wilder, a PCSO spokesman, said disruptive behaviors include interfering with school operations in any way and can be anything from students making threats, having a long-lasting meltdown, fighting and calling in bomb threats.

A student is generally taken into custody “when a situation escalates beyond what school personnel or administration can handle — the vast majority of fights and disruptions are handled by school personnel and school discipline,” Wilder said. “It is when a student gets so out of control, refuses efforts to calm the situation down, and causes such a scene where there is legitimate disruption of the school process that charges are appropriate.”

Fighting biggest arrest factor

A request for random affidavits from each department shows fighting is the major issue for these arrests.

A redacted affidavit from the sheriff's office shows one of those arrests on Jan. 31 was for a fight behind a freshman building at an undisclosed school, when the arrested student began yelling and screaming at another student and trying to fight them.

“(The) Athletic Director had to hold (the student) to the ground to keep (him) from attacking the other student,” the arresting officer wrote, adding that the student kept trying to fight even as he was being handcuffed. “Approximately 200 students stopped to watch the incident.”

In addition to being charged with disrupting a school function and resisting an officer without violence, the student was then charged with violating his probation for petty theft.

In Winter Haven, which had six arrests for disrupting a school function in 2018, a similar incident took place between two girls at New Beginnings High School on Oct. 29. Winter Haven does not track how many students it diverts to Teen Court.

“She wouldn't stop yelling and cursing and she refused to comply with my lawful command,” Officer Wanson Etienne wrote in the report. “(She) became more aggressive and kept walking towards me in an attempt to walk pass me to go to the lobby to fight.”

Kerrin Wolf, an assistant professor of law at Stockton University in New Jersey, has studied the rise in student arrests. His 2013 study, “Booking Students: An Analysis of School Arrests and Court Outcomes,” concluded that “heightened disciplinary and security measures in schools are faulty policy responses, as they have adverse impacts on the students they intend to protect and siphon resources away from policies that more effectively ensure student safety and success.”

His analysis of arrests in Delaware revealed several troubling trends: a great number of students being arrested for minor misbehaviors that could be handled by schools; a highly disproportionate rate of black students faced arrests for their behavior in school; the juvenile justice system is forced to devote scarce resources to processing a high volume of minor school arrests that could have been dealt with by schools in a much more efficient manner; and students who were suspended or expelled were more likely to experience educational struggles and nearly three times more likely to have juvenile justice system involvement the following year.

All of it, he says, provides clear evidence of the phenomenon known as the “school-to-prison pipeline.”

Wolf said he has not looked at the issue since the Parkland shooting, but views new, stricter laws as an interesting development because, in his mind, a lot of schools were moving away from using arrests in that way.

“I think the concern is: Does arresting students for relatively minor behavior do actual good?” Wolf said in a phone interview. “It costs a lot of money to refer students to the JJS, it takes them out of schools … and the courts didn't really think it was their function to be involved in minor behaviors.”

Black students top infractions

A look at statistics provided by the law enforcement agencies shows black students, particularly black males, are arrested for disrupting a school function in substantially greater numbers than their white or Hispanic peers. Since 2013, 178 students have been arrested in the county and Polk's four largest cities. Of that, 73 were black males, 39 were white males and 21 were Hispanic males. At least 130 students were diverted to Teen Court, although Winter Haven did not track those statistics.

More black males — 38 — were sent to the diversion program for disrupting a school function, while 30 of their white peers and nine Hispanic peers were sent. Black girls were more likely to be sent to Teen Court than their peers, with 26 sent to the diversion program compared to 16 white females and nine Hispanic females.

The sheriff, though, doesn't just look at cold statistics — he looks at the children, who in many cases are crying out for help.

“We make sure they show up on our risk assessment lists and they get the help and counseling they need,” Judd said.

230,Putting the honor in Honor Flight: Veterans greeted and feted to D.C. and back,"As a hospice patient with lung cancer and a grim prognosis from doctors, Philip Keenly wasn’t an ideal candidate to make the Collier-Lee Honor Flight trip to Washington, D.C., on Saturday.

The group’s volunteer medical staff debated whether to allow him on the trip or assign him to the less taxing Honor at Home ceremonies planned on the same day at Southwest Florida International Airport.

CLOSE Southwest Florida veterans participated Saturday, May 4, 2019, in the Collier-Lee Honor Flight from Fort Myers to Washington, D.C. Brent Batten, brent.batten@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4776

In the end, they decided with some special accommodations, Keenly could go.

His determination to see the monuments to him and his fellow veterans played into the decision.

“I’m a patriot and I feel very strongly about this country. I went through quite a goddam lot to be here. I’ve never seen it (the Korean War Veterans Memorial). I want to see that our story was told,” said Keenly, one of 86 veterans — the largest contingent in group history — who made the daylong trip on a charter plane to view the war memorials in the nation’s capital.

Eighty-six veterans, 86 stories.

Keenly enlisted in the Marines while still in high school, right after the Korean War broke out.

A rifleman, he took part in the battle at the Chosin Reservoir, notorious for the bitter cold the Marines endured.

“I couldn’t tell you how many guys came back with black feet,” Keenly said, describing the effects of frostbite.

Wounded with shrapnel, he was out of action for 10 days.

“It could have been a helluva lot worse,” he said.

Stories like that of Bob Naum, a B-17 navigator based in England who flew 29 missions over western Europe during World War II. When not plotting a course with a sextant, pencil and paper, he manned a gun fending off German fighters. “I don’t think I ever knocked one down, but I shot a lot of shells at them,” Naum said.

He spent his 96th birthday Saturday in fine style, dancing to big band music and receiving kisses from Andrews Sisters lookalikes near the World War II Memorial.

All his squadron mates are gone, Naum said. “There must be something else someone wants me to do,” he said explaining his longevity.

“It was fantastic,” Naum said near the end of the 20-hour trip.

Or that of James Flanagan, 95. A Marine, Flanagan was learning to fly a dive bomber in preparation for the invasion of Japan when the war ended with the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “President Truman was nice enough to end the war,” Flanagan said.

He’s been to the World War II Memorial before, but never with a group of fellow veterans. “It brings it home now, more than then,” Flanagan said. “You realize what the service people did.”

There was Norma Jock, one of two female veterans on the trip and a Navy recruiter in New York City during the Vietnam War. She never served in Vietnam but being a recruiter in that era carried its own dangers, she recalled. “They blew up (a recruiting station) in the Bronx. They blew up one in Times Square,” she said.

And Joseph Lipps, who served with the Army’s 34th Engineers at the height of the Vietnam War.

Nearly blind, an impairment Lipps attributes to exposure to Agent Orange, although the government hasn’t acknowledged that, Lipps carried with him the names of 25 fallen comrades.

Honor Flight volunteers made pencil etchings of the names from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall and gave them to Lipps, so he can look at them up close under better light at home.

“I wasn’t expecting that,” Lipps said.

There were somber moments on the trip, to be sure. “It’s an emotional roller coaster,” said Rafael Lopez, one of the organizers.

“If you don’t well up with emotion on that sort of thing, you never will,” said Naples resident and Korean War era veteran Ray Nugent, leaving the changing of the guard ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.

But mostly, the mood was festive.

Arriving at Reagan National Airport the veterans and the volunteer guardians accompanying them were greeted by the 32-piece Falls Church, Va., concert band and well-wishers, some volunteers with Honor Flight in Washington, D.C., some simply travelers who walked over from their gates to shake a veteran’s hand and say, “Thank you.”

“That was a wonderful reception. I was in tears. It was just overwhelming, said Army veteran Theodore Cadieu. Although never in combat, some considered Cadieu the most important man in his unit. He was in charge of making sure everyone got paid.

He summed up what many feel about their military service.

“I got a life-changing experience from it. It instilled discipline in me, responsibility. It showed me I can be useful,” he said.

Throughout the day, spontaneous corridors of park visitors would form to thank the Honor Flight group as it made its way around the monuments.

Arriving back at Southwest Florida International, there was an even bigger welcome awaiting veterans.

Organizers estimate 3,000 people, the largest welcoming committee in the group’s six-year history, lined the terminal to shake hands and thank the veterans for their service. There were bands, JROTC units, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, veterans’ groups, costumed military personnel from different eras, flag-waving families and people with no affiliation other than to just thank a veteran.

“Don’t you dare write that I cried,” Nugent said making his way through the phalanx of greeters.

The number of World War II and Korean War veterans is dwindling. “History is leaving us quickly,” Honor Flight media coordinator Rick Wobbe said.

This trip, the local group’s 19th, included 15 veterans from World War II and 34 from Korea.

As the trend continues, the group will bring in Vietnam and Cold War era veterans take their place.

Chartering a plane costs about $130,000, gathered through donations. Storm Smart Shutters contributed $80,000 toward Mission 19.

The next trip is planned in September.

231,Letter to the editor: Lake County Commissioners must be held responsible,"Current events in our country should make it evident why a nine-foot statue of a Confederate general placed in Lake County Historical Museum only resurrects Lake County’s long and ugly history of racism.

The election held Tuesday evening at the old courthouse in Tavares for officers and a Board of Director for the Lake County Historical Society (LCHS) was a continuation of that history.

Why was the curator of the museum even on the ballot as a candidate for president? This organization is responsible for overseeing the actions of this museum.

The LCHS Board of Directors, after delaying the acceptance of new members who wished to make changes to the “old boy rule” of this organization, decided they would illegally change the bylaws of LCHS. Those changes required 2 years membership for the offices of president and vice president, and they were done without notice to members. No proposed bylaws were sent to membership and passed by the present board, in violation of the Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised, which “shall be the authority for this organization”.

The election ballot used was a replica of the old political machine — one check to vote for the full slate of candidates with a confusing description for circling the candidates’ names, further compounded by directions for entering candidate’s names when nominated from the floor.

This entire process was directed by a candidate whose name was on the ballot.

This statue doesn’t even meet the requirements of the new bylaws of this organization “connected with, pertaining to, or tending in any manner to reflect the history of Lake County, Florida…”

Lake County Commissioners must be held responsible for this election charade; they hold the purse strings for this museum.

Lake County cities and residents have made it clear this statue is not welcome in our County Historical Museum.

A 6-year-old boy riding his bike next to a school bus died Wednesday after being run over by the bus when he fell.Police in Rumford, Maine, said Jayce Holt was riding his bike when he went off the sidewalk and into a crosswalk at an intersection.It is believed he was communicating with someone on the bus while riding his bike, police said.Holt did not recognize the bus was turning left until it was too late, police said, and the boy did not have time to stop his bicycle.""By the time he noticed that the bus had turned, tried braking, fell off his bicycle... the bus, unfortunately, ran over him with their rear wheels,"" Rumford Police Chief Stacy Carter said.A makeshift memorial with flowers, teddy bears and balloons formed feet from where the accident happened.

239,Hillsborough 3-year-old to stay with grandparents as medical custody fight continues,"TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - The mother and father of Noah McAdams have been beside themselves.

""It's been awful,"" said the boy's mom, Taylor Bland-Ball. ""I haven't been able to sleep or eat anything at all, so I'm just a nervous wreck.""

Bland-Ball and Joshua McAdams, the boy's father, took their son to Kentucky earlier this week after refusing to give him the medical treatments he needs for cancer.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office issued an alert for his safe return. He was found with his parents in Kentucky.

In court Thursday, a judge agreed to let Noah's maternal grandparents take custody for now. We asked if they were satisfied with that.

""Yeah but we're definitely pushing for more, a lot more, to get our baby back,"" the boy's mother said.

The parents also don't want Noah to get treatments for leukemia. Bland-Ball said a recent test shows that the little boy has no cancer in his blood.

""I think that's the problem we have in this country right now, is the fallacy with doctors, pushing chemotherapy on people. As adults, we have a right to say no to that,"" said the family attorney, Michael Minardi.

246,911 calls detail trampoline park injuries in Central Florida,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - Broken bones, dislocated joints and injuries to patrons' heads and necks are just some of the medical calls that paramedics have responded to at Central Florida trampoline parks, 911 calls placed from those entertainment facilities reveal.

Typically located in strip malls and warehouses, the parks provide children and adults with a place to jump on trampolines of different shapes, sizes and angles. Many facilities also feature trampoline pits filled with foam blocks, dodge ball arenas or obstacle course elements like warped walls and tightropes.

""We had an accident,"" an employee of Hangar 15 in Daytona Beach told an emergency dispatcher last November. ""It sounds like a little girl fell off one of our ledges and hit her head on the way down. Her parents asked me to call 911. She just puked.""

The 4-year-old girl, whose identity was not released due to medical privacy laws, had been jumping into a trampoline filled with foam blocks from an elevated height when she struck her head on the edge of the pit, according to her father.

""She's not bleeding but her mother was rocking her. She's telling her, 'Don't rock me. Don't rock me. It hurts,'"" the father explained to the 911 dispatcher. ""She basically (lost consciousness). She never closed her eyes, but she's not herself right now.""

A spokesperson for Hangar 15 said the company could not provide an update on the child's condition or comment about any particular incident, citing their respect for patrons' privacy.

CBS News reports that at least six people have died of injuries at trampoline parks in the past seven years.

Nearly 18,000 emergency room visits were caused by trampoline park injuries in 2017 nationwide, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a significant increase from the 2,500 injuries reported just four years earlier.

The International Association of Trampoline Parks said those injury numbers are lower or on par with youth sports such as soccer, basketball and volleyball.

The industry trade group attributes the recent increase in injury reports to the growing number of trampoline parks.

""The industry has grown steadily since 2011 when we saw 40 parks worldwide. Now we have over 1,200 across the U.S. and all over the world,"" said Bethany Evans, executive vice president of IATP. ""You can have positive experiences at parks if you just follow the rules and take some precautions with safety.""

Adults and children sustaining injuries, 911 calls show

An employee of Outer Limitz Indoor Trampoline Arena in Orlando called 911 in July 2017 to report that an approximately 30-40 year-old woman had broken her leg.

""Her daughter said that she tried to jump across the trampoline,"" the employee told the 911 dispatcher. ""And the mom attempted it. And she said she thinks her leg just buckled. And it didn't end well.""

""Is there any serious bleeding?"" the dispatcher asked.

""No, but you can see a bone looked like it popped out of place,"" the employee responded.

An 11-year-old boy reportedly broke his arm at that same trampoline park in February 2018, according to another 911 call.

Orlando Fire Department crews responded to Airheads Adventure Arena in Orlando last October to assist an injured boy.

""A parent told her son to try to do a flip and he landed on his back. But he said his neck cracked,"" the employee reported. ""His eyes are rolling back.""

At Sky Zone in Daytona Beach, a child playing dodge ball needed medical attention last summer.

""A little girl just popped her shoulder out of place. Can I get an ambulance, please?"" a manager asked the 911 dispatcher.

Two weeks later, a 19-year-old man reportedly suffered a similar injury.

""I just had someone jump into the foam, possibly dislocated his shoulder,"" said the employee.

At Sky Zone Space Coast in Rockledge, an 11-year-old boy was screaming as he awaited paramedics to treat his knee injury.

""He was just bouncing, and we tried to get him up and he's just not getting up,"" the employee told dispatchers.

Few lawsuits filed against trampoline parks in Central Florida

A News 6 review of court records found very few lawsuits filed against Central Florida's trampoline parks.

A mother sued Hangar 15 for negligence in September 2017 claiming her 16-year-old son jumped from the warped wall and was significantly injured.

Three months later, another woman filed a lawsuit against Hangar 15 alleging that her son was hurt when a trampoline propelled him onto a set of unpadded steps.

Confidential settlements were reached in both cases, court records show.

While the cases were still in litigation, attorneys representing Hangar 15 pointed out that authorized adults signed liability waivers on behalf of the minors.

""By signing this agreement, I am giving up my rights and the rights of my spouse and/or child(ren) to sue Hangar 15 for any injury, including paralysis or death, caused in whole or in part by the negligence or fault of Hangar 15,"" the participant release states.

Legal experts believe such liability releases deter injured participants from filing lawsuits.

In addition, some waivers contain forced arbitration clauses that make it more difficult for customers to take trampoline park operators to court.

""Trampoline parks want to avoid justice. They want to rig the system against anyone who is injured who may assert claims against them,"" said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal.

The Connecticut Democrat is sponsoring a bill that would eliminate forced arbitration clauses in consumer cases.

""Congress should have a role here ... but the biggest deterrent to death and injury at these parks will be the park owners being hauled into court, held responsible, deemed culpable, having to pay,"" Blumenthal told CBS News.

Trampoline park operators respond to News 6

Although representatives from Hangar 15 did not comment on the lawsuits, a company spokesperson told News 6, ""The safety and well-being of our visitors is a top priority, and we adhere to the strictest standards prescribed by the International Association of Trampoline Parks.""

The owner of Airheads Adventure Arena acknowledged that injuries can occur at trampoline parks but he said no one has ever filed an insurance claim against his company, which operates five trampoline parks in Florida and Minnesota.

""I've seen some parks that are poorly run and taking chances,"" Russ Pikus told News 6. ""The first words out of my mouth are, 'Safety. Safety. Safety. Safety.'""

After buying three existing trampoline parks in Florida three years ago, Pikus said he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars bringing the facilities up to trampoline park standards set by ASTM International.

""I can go to bed at night knowing I've done everything possible to keep our patrons safe,"" Pikus said.

In response to this report, a Sky Zone spokesperson provided the following statement:

“At Sky Zone, the safety of our guests is our top priority and we are committed to ongoing safety evaluations. As with any physical activity or sport, there are inherent risks. We invest in best-in-class equipment and take several measures to reduce these risks, such as daily equipment and area spot checks, and educate our guests about safety by posting important safety rules and guidelines throughout our parks. Additionally, we station court monitors near all trampoline attractions to help enforce those rules and monitor guest activity. When there is an injury, all incidents are analyzed internally and we consult with third-party industry experts to continuously learn from them and create the safest environment possible for Guests.”

After a representative with Outer Limitz provided News 6 with an email address, the company did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment for this story.

Industry trade group taking steps to minimize injuries

Unlike at least 11 other states, Florida does not regulate trampoline parks or conduct mandatory inspections.

Even without state oversight, the International Association of Trampoline Parks plans to require its member parks to be evaluated by outside inspectors.

""We are looking to require third party inspections so that parents and visitors of our parks can have an extra layer of understanding and comfortability when they go visit a park to know ... they are operating with guest safety at the forefront of their agenda,"" said Evans.

The industry trade group shared the following recommendations for guests visiting trampoline parks:

1. Never jump without a court monitor stationed at the activity.

2. Be certain to read all rules and regulations posted throughout the park.

3. Make sure to watch a safety video or have a safety briefing from staff.

4. Always be aware of your surroundings, and never jump around or near other jumpers.

5. If the park has a foam pit, make sure the foam is at or above the level of the trampoline.

""The AITP works tirelessly to improve industry standards and to make sure we're creating positive experiences for guests that visit our member parks,"" Evans told News 6.

256,Polk students taken into custody for disruptions increasing,"Sheriff Grady Judd : ""Everybody we take to the Juvenile Assessment Center for what I call the ‘therapeutic ride’ don’t all go into the arrest portal.”

LAKELAND — In December, Haines City School Resource Officer Daniel Hicks responded to Eastside Elementary School, where a student, already enrolled in a behavioral turnaround program, had flipped over a table and chairs, threw papers on the floor and cussed at his teacher because he had been told to complete his assignment or he would lose a privilege to play basketball.

“I don't care about going to jail — my teacher is crazy,” the boy allegedly told School Principal Lorine Smith when she arrived to calm the boy.

Another student in the room had to be removed for their own safety.

Hicks gave the boy one final chance to pick up the table, chairs and papers, but he refused and told Hicks he did not like his teacher, Terry Benton, and did not care about what would happen to him. Hicks placed him in custody. The boy was already in a diversion program for a weapons charge, so Hicks took him to the Haines City Police Department for processing and then transported him to the Juvenile Assessment Center in Bartow.

The boy was one of eight juveniles arrested in Haines City last year for disrupting a school function, a misdemeanor. Three students have already been arrested this year for the same charge, records from Haines City Police show.

It is a charge that has seen a great increase in the last year in the number of students arrested or sent to a diversion program. It is a possible unintended consequence of The Marjory Stoneman Douglas Act, passed last year following the horrific shooting of 17 people at the Parkland, Florida, high school. The law requires a tougher stance on disruptions at schools and additional mental health help for struggling students.

“Since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas event, words matter,” said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. “If you say you're going to blow up a school, if you say you're going to kill a teacher, if you say you're going to kill a student, we know statistically that's childish talk, but we are no longer at the mercy of guessing what's in your mind.”

But Judd cautioned that not all students taken into custody are officially arrested, charged with this misdemeanor and then taken to juvenile detention.

“There's arrests and there's pre-diversion arrests — everybody we take to the Juvenile Assessment Center for what I call the 'therapeutic ride' don't all go into the arrest portal,” Judd said. “Some go into the pre-arrest diversion program.”

Schools Superintendent Jacqueline Byrd declined to comment for this story, but school district spokeswoman Rachel Pleasant said the district is not responsible for the arrests, adding that they defer to law enforcement judgment and authority in determining when a child is taken into custody.

“The decision and power to make an arrest lies with law enforcement, not the school district,” Pleasant said. “We work closely with our law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of our students and schools.”

Arrest makes national news

One of the arrests this year made national news, when a Lawton Chiles Middle Academy sixth-grader was questioned by a substitute teacher about his refusal to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. The situation escalated, a school dean was called and the school resource officer accompanied the dean to the classroom. The student had a meltdown when he was asked to leave the classroom, saying it was the substitute who should leave because she was racist.

The principal had planned to send the students home with his mother when she arrived at school. Instead, the SRO made the decision to place him into custody and send him to the Juvenile Assessment Center in Bartow, where he was placed in what's known as a pre-arrest diversion program — also called Teen Court. Students qualify for Teen Court only if they have no prior record with law enforcement. If they complete the program successfully, the incident will be removed from their record.

Of the Polk County Sheriff's Office; Lakeland, Winter Haven, Lake Wales and Haines City police departments, Lakeland Police saw one of the largest percentage increases in arrests, going from no arrests in 2014 through 2017, to 14 last year. In addition, they went from sending no students to a diversion program from 2013-2016, and three in 2017, to sending 11 students last year.

Lakeland Police Department spokesman Gary Gross said the department's school resource officers have already made five arrests this year, along with sending seven juveniles to Teen Court.

There's been “more of a presence (on campuses) since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018,” said Gross, adding that law enforcement “investigates all threats and any acts that may create a disruption at the school.”

Those threats include anything from a fistfight to a bomb threat to an outright threat to kill someone.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office arrested the same number of students as Lakeland Police, with 14. But it had 44 students in 2018 sent to Teen Court, which was up from 10 in 2017. The PCSO, which services a larger area than any of the police departments, saw the largest increase in sending students to Teen Court.

Scott Wilder, a PCSO spokesman, said disruptive behaviors include interfering with school operations in any way and can be anything from students making threats, having a long-lasting meltdown, fighting and calling in bomb threats.

A student is generally taken into custody “when a situation escalates beyond what school personnel or administration can handle — the vast majority of fights and disruptions are handled by school personnel and school discipline,” Wilder said. “It is when a student gets so out of control, refuses efforts to calm the situation down, and causes such a scene where there is legitimate disruption of the school process that charges are appropriate.”

Fighting biggest arrest factor

A request for random affidavits from each department shows fighting is the major issue for these arrests.

A redacted affidavit from the sheriff's office shows one of those arrests on Jan. 31 was for a fight behind a freshman building at an undisclosed school, when the arrested student began yelling and screaming at another student and trying to fight them.

“(The) Athletic Director had to hold (the student) to the ground to keep (him) from attacking the other student,” the arresting officer wrote, adding that the student kept trying to fight even as he was being handcuffed. “Approximately 200 students stopped to watch the incident.”

In addition to being charged with disrupting a school function and resisting an officer without violence, the student was then charged with violating his probation for petty theft.

In Winter Haven, which had six arrests for disrupting a school function in 2018, a similar incident took place between two girls at New Beginnings High School on Oct. 29. Winter Haven does not track how many students it diverts to Teen Court.

“She wouldn't stop yelling and cursing and she refused to comply with my lawful command,” Officer Wanson Etienne wrote in the report. “(She) became more aggressive and kept walking towards me in an attempt to walk pass me to go to the lobby to fight.”

Kerrin Wolf, an assistant professor of law at Stockton University in New Jersey, has studied the rise in student arrests. His 2013 study, “Booking Students: An Analysis of School Arrests and Court Outcomes,” concluded that “heightened disciplinary and security measures in schools are faulty policy responses, as they have adverse impacts on the students they intend to protect and siphon resources away from policies that more effectively ensure student safety and success.”

His analysis of arrests in Delaware revealed several troubling trends: a great number of students being arrested for minor misbehaviors that could be handled by schools; a highly disproportionate rate of black students faced arrests for their behavior in school; the juvenile justice system is forced to devote scarce resources to processing a high volume of minor school arrests that could have been dealt with by schools in a much more efficient manner; and students who were suspended or expelled were more likely to experience educational struggles and nearly three times more likely to have juvenile justice system involvement the following year.

All of it, he says, provides clear evidence of the phenomenon known as the “school-to-prison pipeline.”

Wolf said he has not looked at the issue since the Parkland shooting, but views new, stricter laws as an interesting development because, in his mind, a lot of schools were moving away from using arrests in that way.

“I think the concern is: Does arresting students for relatively minor behavior do actual good?” Wolf said in a phone interview. “It costs a lot of money to refer students to the JJS, it takes them out of schools … and the courts didn't really think it was their function to be involved in minor behaviors.”

Black students top infractions

A look at statistics provided by the law enforcement agencies shows black students, particularly black males, are arrested for disrupting a school function in substantially greater numbers than their white or Hispanic peers. Since 2013, 178 students have been arrested in the county and Polk's four largest cities. Of that, 73 were black males, 39 were white males and 21 were Hispanic males. At least 130 students were diverted to Teen Court, although Winter Haven did not track those statistics.

More black males — 38 — were sent to the diversion program for disrupting a school function, while 30 of their white peers and nine Hispanic peers were sent. Black girls were more likely to be sent to Teen Court than their peers, with 26 sent to the diversion program compared to 16 white females and nine Hispanic females.

The sheriff, though, doesn't just look at cold statistics — he looks at the children, who in many cases are crying out for help.

“We make sure they show up on our risk assessment lists and they get the help and counseling they need,” Judd said.

257,Project SEARCH graduates celebrated,"The Project SEARCH program at Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center works with students with disabilities, ages 18 to 22, to help prepare them for skilled jobs in a variety of industries.

LAKELAND — Sitting in the front row of Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center's Mulaney Family Auditorium on Friday were Project SEARCH's six graduates, decked out in caps and gowns and smiling after completing the training program for students with disabilities. Behind them — literally and figuratively — were teary-eyed family members, who had hoped for this day for years, and dozens of LRHMC employees, who helped to train the graduates.

""You're ready to begin your adult lives in our community,” Sandy Perlewitz, the Project SEARCH facilitator for Polk County Public Schools, told the graduates. “We love you so much.”

The Project SEARCH program at LRHMC works with students with disabilities, ages 18 to 22, to help prepare them for skilled jobs in a variety of industries. This is the third class of graduates from the program, which began 18 months ago as a partnership between Lakeland Regional Health, Polk County Public Schools, the Center for Independent Living in Central Florida Inc., Vocational Rehabilitation, and the Florida Developmental Disabilities Council. Project SEARCH, which began at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, is a business-led, one-year work-preparation program for young people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Even after employment, students continue to receive job coaching and support from Center for Independent Living and Vocational Rehabilitation trainers while working and earning incomes.

According to Cornell University's 2017 Disability Statistics, people with disabilities are employed less than half as often as their counterparts without disabilities. Project SEARCH offers students with disabilities a way to overcome that with on-the-job skills training.

All six graduates landed jobs — LRHMC hired four of the graduates, while another has a job at Hawthorne Inn Assisted Living Facility and the sixth was hired by Cardinal Health. A video produced by the hospital showed each of their reactions as they were offered full-time positions.

Darius Gibbs-Ellis received a job offer to work on “The Trash Team” in the hospital.

“I got the job!” he said after receiving his offer, a smile spreading across his face. Friday morning, he said he loves his job and the program. ”It's an opportunity for people. I want to help people out with their opportunity.”

""He does a good job,” Wilson said Friday morning.

Gibbs-Ellis was raised by his grandmother, Alma Franklyn, who is also raising his three siblings. She works as an accountant in Lakeland.

“Watching him mature into the man he has become was moving,” Franklyn said. “I'm still crying.”

As a boy, he attended Cleveland Court Elementary School. The school's then-secretary Diane Kossman saw the goodness in Franklyn and her grandchildren and informally adopted them as a second grandmother, often walking the children home from school.

“She was a special lady, just watching her provide for those four children,” said Kossman, hugging Gibbs-Ellis.

He graduated from Lakeland High School, for which he played defensive end on the state championship football team. His coach, Michael Farley, was also on hand to see his success Friday.

“You're going to buy me lunch now, right?” Farley joked.

As interns at the hospital, the group did everything from preparing food, sterilizing instruments, working in and around the operating room and patient transportation. They also learned how to shake hands, write a resume, practice interviewing and several other “soft skills” needed for success.

Scott Dimmick, senior vice president and chief human resources officer for LRH, told the students that he, too, struggled to achieve success after a childhood rooted in poverty.

“I had a few mentors and advisers who said never give up,” Dimmick said, adding that the hospital's three core values of “treasure, nurture and inspire” pertained to them, too. “We will fully fund your career growth in our organization — we will pay for all of that tuition.”

Graduate Kevontae Jones was described as someone who smiled constantly and was always willing to try something new.

“I am so blessed in being here,” he said in a brief speech. “Thanks to my mama right there, who inspired me.”

Polk County Public Schools Superintendent Jacqueline Byrd, Deputy Superintendent John Hill, Chief Academic Officer Michael Akes and Director of Exceptional Student Education Diane Taylor were all in attendance Friday morning. Assistant Superintendent of Learning Support Kimberly Steinke explained that they go to every graduation ceremony in the district and shake thousands of hands.

“But this is definitely by far one of the best and most special graduations we go to each year,” Steinke said. “It's important you understand how precious and how valuable you are to Polk County Schools … You are the epitome of what we want going through this program.”

259,Judge gives grandparents custody of boy as parents fight cancer treatment,"The parents of 3-year-old Noah McAdams fled the state rather than continue chemotherapy. Now a judge has placed the child in the custody of his maternal grandparents.

TAMPA — The 3-year-old boy caught in a legal tug of war over how he will be treated for leukemia will be turned over to the custody of his maternal grandparents, a judge ruled Thursday.

Noah McAdams, 3, was tracked down Monday in Kentucky, after his parents refused additional chemotherapy treatment for his acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, and instead fled Tampa.

The parents, Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball, failed to show up for the boy’s scheduled chemotherapy treatment at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg. To keep him out of the hospital, they decided to treat his cancer with natural remedies and fled the state, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office.

That led Florida authorities to issue an endangered child alert on Monday. Hours later, the family was tracked down to a motel room in Georgetown, Ky.

Hillsborough Circuit Judge Lisa Campbell ruled Thursday that Noah will go home with his maternal grandparents while she decides how his cancer will be treated. The boy is currently at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg. When doctors decided to release him, he’ll go home with the grandparents.

But the case is far from over and Noah will not yet resume treatment.

The judge must also decide whether the parents were within their rights to decline chemotherapy. To prepare for that hearing, the parents’ lawyer will have a doctor he found examine the child and give a second opinion as to the best treatment option for Noah. That will lead to another court hearing.

Before Thursday’s hearing started, the 23-year-old mother brought photos of her brown-eyed, blonde-haired child and laid them out on a courtroom table. She said she was sending a silent message to the judge, social workers and child protective investigators working on Noah’s case.

“I wanted (the photos) to be out when everybody was documenting, when they had the cameras going during the hearing,” Bland-Ball said. “I wanted people to see, those that are watching the case and the social workers to see as well, that we’re a happy family. Noah was very happy with us. He’s so loved, so there’s really no reason to go through all this.”

The boy was first diagnosed with leukemia by Johns Hopkins doctors on April 4, the mother said, after his parents took him from one emergency room to another in an attempt to find what had suddenly made him “sluggish” and “not himself.”

At first, Bland-Ball and her husband, Joshua McAdams, agreed that Noah should undergo chemotherapy treatments at the hospital, they told the judge. But after about 10 days there, the boy's father said they became worried about their son's care and told staff they were going to seek a second medical opinion.

“The hospital's governing body was disorganized and the doctors were not pleasant or professional to us,” McAdams, 28, testified. “It seemed like doctors were disappearing on us and just passing down Noah's information second hand ...

“There was intimidation from social workers who looked at me like I was not interested in my son’s health because I didn't want to give my son chocolate milk, or pudding, or ice cream. I care for my son and it's very important that we watch what he eats.”

The father said his wife contacted Johns Hopkins multiple times about their concerns. Then last week she told doctors they had had enough. Noah would no longer go to his scheduled chemotherapy appointments. The family set out for Ohio, where Bland-Ball said she had arranged for Noah to see a doctor who would provide alternative treatments.

“We have phone records we have voicemails we left for them and we even spoke to the social worker the physicians assistant and the doctor to tell them we were seeking a second opinion,” Bland-Ball said.

The father testified that the couple had already started treating Noah with CBD oil, fresh foods and clean alkaline water.

But Dr. Bijal D. Shah, head of the Moffitt Cancer Center’s acute lymphoblastic leukemia program, told the Tampa Bay Times this week that natural remedies do nothing.

In fact, he said the accepted medical treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia has become very effective. The cure rate is up to 90 percent, though it does require a patient to endure 2½ years of chemotherapy and the resulting side effects.

Kentucky authorities found the family Monday evening. They took Noah to a local hospital for treatment, then put him on a plane back to Tampa. His parents are now the subject of an investigation into criminal charges of medical neglect for refusing proper medical treatment for a child considered to be “gravely ill.”

During the hearing, a child protective investigators testified that she left voicemails and a Facebook message for the parents to tell them that they were under investigation. But the parents testified they never got those messages.

The couple’s lawyer, Michael Minardi, said a blood test taken Wednesday showed no trace of leukemia in Noah's blood.

“I know a doctor's not going to come back and say that chemotherapy is the best option and is the only treatment for him,” the lawyer said, “and I think that's the problem we have in this country right now is the fallacy of doctors pushing chemotherapy ... It destroys people.”

But Shah told the Times that patients who stop chemotherapy early are risking their health. The cancer return almost always returns.

“I put it in the same box as those who fear vaccination,” the doctor said. “The reality is, what we risk by not taking chemotherapy, just as what we risk by not taking vaccines, is much, much worse.”

260,Judge: Boy will stay with grandparents while being treated by doctors,"- A Hillsborough County judge ruled Thursday that 3-year-old Noah McAdams will not be returned to his mom and dad - at least right now.

He’ll stay with his grandparents for the time being.

“We do not believe this is a fair or a just resolution but we do have the ability to fight,” said attorney Michael Minardi.

“It has been awful, I haven’t been able to sleep or eat at all, I’ve been a nervous wreck,” said the boy’s mother, Taylor Bland-Ball.

The family is wrapped up in a legal fight following a frantic multi-state search for the boy and his parents earlier this week.

Their son was diagnosed with leukemia. After two rounds of chemotherapy, doctors said Noah was technically cancer-free. However, doctors wanted to continue treatment.

Noah's parents disagreed with doctors on what should be done. Ultimately, a judge issued a court order for Noah to be treated and an appointment was set for April 22.

Instead of going to the court-ordered appointment, Noah’s parents took him to Kentucky in search of alternative treatments.

“Seeing that he had no cancer cells in his body, we said we gotta find a different treatment one that wouldn’t hurt so much,” said Bland-Ball.

“We have to get over that fallacy that chemo is the only treatment for people with cancer at this point, especially in Florida we have medical cannabis CBD, both of those are viable options,” Minardi said.

The parents will be allowed visitation, both at the grandparents’ house and in the hospital where they are planning to see Noah Thursday night. Going forward, they know their legal fight is still far from over.

“We're definitely pushing for more a lot more to get our baby back,” said Bland-Ball.",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/judge-boy-will-stay-with-grandparents-while-being-treated-by-doctors,2019-05-02T22:45:47Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - A local family at the center of a medical custody battle is fighting to get their son back.

Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball left Hillsborough County on Monday with their 3-year-old son, sparking a multi-state search. The three were eventually found safe in Kentucky.

Authorities put out urgent alerts for 3-year-old Noah, saying the boy was in need of ""lifesaving medical care."" Hillsborough County deputies said McAdams and Bland-Ball failed to bring him to a medically-necessary hospital procedure last week and refused to follow up with additional lifesaving medical care.

The couple tells News Channel 8 they were avoiding getting the boy chemotherapy. Noah has leukemia and his parents wanted to treat him with something other than what doctors recommended. They told us the chemo would be too tough on Noah's body.

""Since he's been with us, his health has completely gotten back to normal levels,"" McAdams said.

In court Wednesday, Noah's parents asked for custody of the boy. But the sheriff's office and guardian ad litem program says they don't want the media there due to health and age concerns.

Noah's parents don't mind.

""We feel like it's silly. Why postpone it - what's there to hide?"" Bland-Ball said. ""Everything has already been talked about. It's all over media, all over TV all over social media.""

The couple tells us they're not opposed to treatment, they just want to do it differently. Social media posts show they previously spoke out against the use of chemo. Bland-Ball credited her son's improved health to vitamins and alternative treatments.

""We want him to be treated with something that has less side effects,"" Bland-Ball. ""Chemotherapy is so brutal on a body.""

262,"Boy, 2, wanders off and drowns in Lake Santa Fe","Detectives believe the child wandered away from his home, crossed the street, passed through a neighbor’s backyard and fell into the water near a bulkhead.

A 2-year-old boy drowned in Lake Santa Fe in Melrose Thursday morning after wandering away from his home.

Putnam County sheriff's deputies went to 738 Seminole Ridge Road about 8:15 a.m. in response to a call that the child was last seen around 7:30 a.m. at the home, a sheriff’s office news release states.

During the search, a deputy found the boy near the shore about 100 yards from the home, dove in to get him out and began CPR. The boy was taken to Putnam Community Medical Center and was declared to be dead.

Detectives believe the child wandered away from his home, crossed the street, passed through a neighbor’s backyard and fell into the water near a bulkhead.

Three adults and several other children were in the home when the boy wandered off. None of the other children left the home, PCSO spokeswoman Allison Waters-Merritt said.

“There are two families that reside in the home and a total of eight children, including the one that passed away,” Waters-Merritt said. “We received information that one of the adults was taking an older child to school and shortly thereafter was when the child wandered away. There were three other adults in the house.”

The Florida Department of Children and Families was contacted and the sheriff’s investigation is ongoing.

“Living in this area, there is a treasure trove of waterways that many of us enjoy and often take for granted,” Sheriff H.D. “Gator” DeLoach said in the news release. “However, these waterways can also prove to be deadly. I would implore everyone who lives near a waterbody and has children to install door alarms. Small children can be fast and are often fixated by water. Installing alarms can help alert family members if a child walks out of the house.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190502/boy-2-wanders-off-and-drowns-in-lake-santa-fe?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T15:06:37Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
263,Mother says tongue-tie procedure helped her baby boy,"<p>It happens to all of us. Even television anchors get tongue tied, but for children like Dylan Ramkisson  being tongue tied is a treatable medical condition known as <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tongue-tie/symptoms-causes/syc-20378452"" target=""_blank"">ankyloglossia</a>.</p>

<p>From the time he came home from the hospital, Dylan's mother  knew something was wrong. Melissa Ramkisson said her son made grunting noises in his sleep, seemed to have a stiff neck, spit up a lot, wouldn't breastfeed and hated being on his back.</p>

<p>Ramkisson took her son from doctor to doctor. Finally, this emergency room nurse figured out the problem. The condition happens when the tissue under the tongue, the frenum, doesn't develop properly.</p>

<p>Dentist Leslie Haller said in some cases the tissue is so tight, it literally ties the tongue to the floor of the mouth. Haller said babies with tongue tie don't swallow properly and can't breastfeed well. She said pediatricians don't screen for it, so it often goes undiagnosed and treated.</p>

<p>Victoria Wiltshire of Plantation was desperately looking for help for her son, Alexander, when someone told her about Ramkisson, the founder of <a href=""https://helpwithties.com/2018/10/03/my-journey/"" target=""_blank"">Help With Ties</a>, an organization dedicated to educating new parents.</p>

<p>""I would hate for another mom to go through what I went through,"" Ramkisson said. ""It's supposed to a bonding experience and it just wasn't.""</p>

<p>The good news: Haller said the solution is a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL4ROT89t1sVtyFCoK6Gls4E0xqKlSOvbm&v=S6WFfER3jL8"" target=""_blank"">lingual frenictomy</a>, a 10 minute laser procedure to release the tight tissue. It prevents a host of future problems. </p>

<p>""A child with tongue tie can have speech problems, sleep problems,"" Haller said. ""They are tired and cranky and can have behavioral problems and end up being diagnosed with ADHD.""</p>

<p>Alexander and Dyland were lucky. Their tongue ties were diagnosed and treated, but doctors say there are many adults with it who are suffering with sleep apnea and speech problems. Local 10 News photojournalist Curt Calhoon learned he has tongue tie while helping to produce this report.</p>

<p>Calhoon said he always hated how it sounded like he was slurring his words and had trouble pronouncing certain words. He underwent the frenectomy and hopes both his speech and maybe even his snoring will improve over time.<br />

A 16-year-old unaccompanied migrant boy from Guatemala fell ill after he was transferred to a government shelter in Texas and later died, officials said Wednesday.The boy crossed the border near El Paso, Texas, on April 19, and was taken to a shelter in Brownsville a day later, according to Guatemala's Foreign Ministry.He did not appeal ill when he was transferred to the care of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to a statement from the Administration for Children and Families, the division within HHS that cares for migrant children who cross the border alone. But the next morning, he had fever, chills and a headache and was taken to a hospital, where he was treated and released that day.When the teen didn't recover, he was taken to a second hospital and transferred to a children's hospital. Guatemalan officials said he had a severe infection in his brain and had emergency surgery, but never stabilized and died Tuesday. The cause of death was under review, as was the incident. His name was not released.The boy's brother and Guatemalan consular officials visited him while he was hospitalized, and hospital staff frequently updated his family in Guatemala, according to Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the Administration for Children and Families.It was the third death in government custody since December, as the United States deals with a surge of unaccompanied children and Central American families arriving at the southern border. Two other children died while in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody shortly after they arrived at the border.Trump administration officials have said the surge has strained resources beyond the breaking point, but immigrant advocates and some Democrats say part of the crisis is due to President Donald Trump's own hard-line rhetoric and failed border policies.The 16-year-old was from the municipality of Camotan in the eastern area of Chiquimula. The Guatemalan Consulate in McAllen tried to get humanitarian visas so the parents could be with their son, but they were too old to travel, the foreign ministry said. The boy's body will be repatriated, but it's not clear when.In December, 8-year-old Felipe Gomez Alonzo died Christmas Eve from influenza and a rapid, progressive infection that led to organ failure shortly after crossing the border. His death was two weeks after that of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin, who also had a bacterial infection that quickly led to sepsis and organ failure.Both of those children were also from Guatemala but arrived with a family member and were in Customs and Border Protection custody, not the care of Health and Human Services, which is tasked with dealing with the care of migrant children who arrive at the border alone. The agency also managed the children who were separated from their parents by the Trump administration last summer.The last time a child died in the custody of Health and Human services was 2015.The teen's death comes as the Trump administration asks for $4.5 billion in supplemental funding for the border, mostly for humanitarian aid. The official request said Health and Human Services will exhaust its resources by June. The funding request includes $2.8 billion to increase shelter capacity to about 23,600 total beds for unaccompanied children.There were 50,036 unaccompanied children encountered during the last budget year, and so far this budget year there have been 35,898 children. The highest number was in 2014: 57,496.Their average length of stay in a government shelter is 66 days, up from 59 during fiscal year 2018 and 40 in the 2016 fiscal year.

266,"Gunman steals shoes from teen walking to bus stop, Lake County deputies say","LAKE COUNTY, Fla. - A man with a gun forced a teenager to give him his shoes as the boy was walking to a bus stop Thursday, according to the Lake County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies said the boy was walking around 11 a.m. when a man on a four-wheeler approached him then a few minutes later the suspect, James Christopher White, approached from a nearby yard and started demanding the victim's shoes.

The victim told the men no three times before White pulled a gun out of his pocket, cocked it back and said, ""Give me your shoes,"" while pointing the firearm at the ground, the arrest report said.

At that point, the victim was afraid so he gave White the shoes, according to the affidavit.

The 15-year-old victim told a friend and that friend's mother confronted White and got the shoes back, authorities said.

On Tuesday, the boy's parents contacted authorities about pressing charges in the case. Deputies said they located White that same day and when he saw them, he started running but was quickly taken into custody.

White spontaneously uttered, ""I don't know about no gun and shoes,"" according to the report.

He was arrested on charges of robbery with a firearm and petit theft.

278,Review: Hank Williams Jr. gets rowdy at Hertz Arena,"CLOSE New security policies at Hertz Arena ask patrons to either bring clear bags or no bags at all into the arena. Amanda Inscore, AINSCORE@NEWS-PRESS.COM

Hank Williams Jr. apparently felt a little rowdy Friday night. But come on, did we really expect anything less?

This is the original country music hellraiser, after all (second, perhaps, only to his famous daddy). And that women-chasing, party-hearty attitude was on full display at Hertz Arena.

Bocephus swaggered around the stage in his trademark sunglasses and an endless supply of baseball caps and cowboy hats. And in between crowd-pleasing asides about his guns, his dad and Obama, he and his white-hot, rip-roaring country-rock band delivered one whiskey-soaked anthem after another about women, drinking and, well, women and drinking.

“Do you wanna drink?” Hank shouted on one of his biggest hits, “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight.” “Do you wanna party?”

The audience cheered and clapped and sang along to every word.

The answer, apparently, was a resounding ""Hell, yeah!”

Along the way, Hank and company put on a sweaty, (mostly) thrilling show packed with hits like “Family Tradition,” “Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound,” “The Conversation” and “Born to Boogie — and also a surprising number of cover songs, too.

He did a lot of songs by Hank Sr., of course, but also some sizzling, riff-packed salutes to ZZ Top (“Waitin’ for the Bus”) Johnny Cash (“I Walk the Line,” with Hank getting his voice really, really low), Lynyrd Skynyrd (“Gimme Three Steps”) and Aerosmith (“Walk this Way,” where Hank dabbled in a little rap-singing —with modest success).

His band was loud, raucous and super-tight with just the right amount of rough around the edges, boogeying and rocking and thundering like the best bar band you’ve ever seen in your life.

Then there was Hank himself, guitar slung around his neck and still full of fire and lust at age 69. And still apparently chasing women, too, as he urged the ladies to bare it all on one song and sang about “the hunt” on many of the others.

“I really, really, really, really, really, really like GIRLS,” he sang on a cover of George Thorogood’s “I Really Like Girls.”

Oh yes, he does.

It wasn’t a perfect show, though, especially in the problematic second half. A solo acoustic set — just Hank and his guitar, seated in front of a black curtain — rambled on for too long with loosely organized performances of songs like “Outlaw Women” and “A Country Boy Can Survive.” It was cool to see such an intimate performance, but those songs desperately needed less talking and more focus.

Then there was Hank’s fiddle playing on the otherwise awesome, propulsive cover of Hank Sr.’s “Kaw-Liga.” Maybe it was supposed to be funny. Or maybe it was meant to show a “Who cares?” attitude. But his fiddle playing was monotone, weak and downright hard to listen to. It did nothing but drag down the song.

Finally, there was the anti-climactic finale. After a rousing version of his dad’s “Hey, Good Lookin’,” Hank hollered “Bocephus in the House!” and abruptly left the stage. The band continued on, playing a long boogie-woogie instrumental and setting up the expectation that Hank would be coming back onstage soon.

And then — house lights on. No encore, nothing.

Oh well. I guess we’ll all just go home now.

Still, most of the show was fun, raw and just what you’d hope for from the country music outlaw. He told stories about all the guns he owns on his property (apparently a lot), his popular exhibit at Nashville’s Country Music Hall of Fame, his legendary dad and how he learned to play piano from people like Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis. And in between, he delivered some memorable moments.

His heartfelt performance of his dad’s “Lovesick Blues,” for example, featured Hank perfectly mimicking his dad’s yodeling (as he said at one point Friday: He ain’t adopted). And earlier in the show, he did both parts of his Hank Sr. tribute “The Conversation,” which famously starts with the line, “Hank, let’s talk about your daddy.”

CLOSE ESPN says they are bringing back country star Hank Williams Jr. to sing the ""Monday Night Football"" theme. Time_Sports

The coolest moment of all in the 90-minute set: Hank turning over all three choruses of “Family Tradition” to his eager audience, which gamely sang every single word (including the popular “To get drunk! To get stoned!” chant). Hank didn’t have to sing the chorus once.

“I think you got it!” he said, grinning.

Hank was in good company, it seemed. “All my rowdy friends are in this place tonight!” he sang as he pointed out into the audience during “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight.""

Hank was feeling rowdy, of course. And luckily, so were all his Hertz Arena friends, too.

279,Steps taken to revamp criminal justice laws,"- Florida lawmakers on Friday overwhelmingly approved a criminal-justice package that includes the first change in 35 years to the legal threshold for felony theft and reducing punishment for some non-violent offenders.

Supporters said the legislation, which now heads to Gov. Ron DeSantis, is an “important first step” to addressing problems in Florida’s criminal-justice system, with some lawmakers saying they would like to see it go further.

“Obviously, there’s more that I wish we could have done,” said Sen. Jeff Brandes, a St. Petersburg Republican who sponsored the bill (HB 7125) in the Senate. “I hope over the next few years we will cast a bold vision for what criminal justice should look like in this state.”

At the start of the legislative session, Brandes proposed a package that would have allowed thousands of non-violent offenders to be released from prison earlier for good behavior. It also would have given judges more leeway over sentences of nonviolent drug offenders.

But the Senate could not reach a compromise on some of the biggest changes proposed by Brandes, and a deal was struck to strip a number of provisions as the legislative session prepared to end. Lawmakers were expected to finish most of the session Friday, returning Saturday only to pass a budget.

The House voted 110-0 on Friday to give final approval to the package, which the Senate approved in a 39-1 vote Thursday. Only Sen. Randolph Bracy, D-Orlando, voted against the bill.

The package includes, among many things, raising the felony-theft threshold from $300 to $750. The House has initially sought to increase the threshold to $1,000, but that came down amid strong opposition from some of the state’s largest retailers like Walgreens and Walmart.

“It’s a long time coming,” said Rep. Wengay Newton, D-St. Petersburg. Using an example of a 14-year-old boy who stole a cell phone and had a felony on his record, Newton said raising the threshold “gives young people opportunities so they can come back.”

Other changes praised by Republicans and Democrats in both chambers included expanding the availability of inmate reentry programs and offering more opportunities for felons to get occupational licenses.

Also, the bill would raise the base threshold amount for trafficking in hydrocodone from 14 grams to 28 grams, and non-violent drug offenders would have their driver's licenses suspended for six months instead of a year.

But lawmakers didn’t go as far as many criminal-justice reform advocates wanted. For example, the Senate agreed to scrap a proposal that would have allowed convicted non-violent offenders to be released from prison after serving 65 percent of their sentences instead of 85 percent for good behavior.

Another proposal that did not make it across the finish line would have allowed people who committed aggravated assaults or attempted aggravated assaults to have sentences reduced if their crimes took place before July 1, 2016, when the Legislature had harsher mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines for those crimes.

Tossing some of these proposals frustrated people such as Bracy, who said he was “tired of submitting to the will of the House” on issues.

But other reform advocates, including some conservative-leaning groups, were supportive of the package overall.

“This is only the beginning, and we are so encouraged by the appetite to shift resources from the bricks and mortar of prison to developing better interventions to reduce recidivism, prevent victimization and promote public safety,” said Chelsea Murphy, the Florida state director for Right on Crime, which is backed by Koch Industries and the conservative Koch network of donors.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/mobile-app-news-feed/steps-taken-to-revamp-criminal-justice-laws,2019-05-03T19:00:23Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

POLK COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - Polk County parents are reporting a rash of rashes making its way through some schools. With measles a hot topic across the country, the bumps have some parents concerned.

A spokesperson for Polk County Schools told News Channel 8 Thursday the district was aware of some rashes being reported but there was no concern of an outbreak.

School officials say health officials told them, ""the health department routinely monitors for rash illnesses across the county. We are also prompt to investigate outbreaks that are reported. The health department is not investigating any active outbreaks at this time.""

Megan Lambert's son Chris woke up last Thursday covered from head to toe in mysterious red bumps. She said the third grader couldn't stop scratching his burning skin.

""It was all on my head, all the way down to my waist,"" the boy explained.

At first, Lambert feared measles, even though her son is vaccinated.

""I wanted answers,"" she said. ""I wanted to know what it was.""

After two trips to the doctor, they had a diagnosis...fifth disease.

You may not have heard of it, but Dr. Richard Frates at Lakeland's Watson Clinic said roughly 50 percent of people have had the viral disease at some point. He says he's seen a few cases in his office the last few weeks.

Frates explained there's no vaccine for fifth disease because, unlike measles, it is relatively mild and doesn't cause other dangerous complications. However, fifth disease is contagious before a trace of the rash even breaks out, meaning it's easy for kids and families to be exposed without realizing.

Lambert said a number of her friends' kids have broken out in similar rashes, diagnosed as fifth disease.

A week later, Chris said he's almost feeling good as new except for sensitivity to light and heat. His mom just hopes now her older son isn't her second kid to come down with the fifth.

Because fifth disease is viral, there's not much parents can do besides let kids rest up and let the virus run its course.

However, it can be problematic for pregnant women so if you experience the symptoms, you should give your doctor a call.",http://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/what-s-the-weird-rash-going-around-polk-county-/1974902230,2019-05-03T14:52:26Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
282,"Clearwater carjacker arrested after stealing FHP cruiser, trooper say","- An accused carjacker is in custody after he allegedly used a stolen hammer to steal a car and also stole a Florida Highway Patrol trooper’s cruiser to avoid an arrest, police said.

On Wednesday, Clearwater police said Shane Jensen stole a hammer from the Home Depot located on Gulf to Bay Boulevard and U.S. Highway 19. They said he tried to carjack a truck but one of them inside fought back.

Jensen moved onto a pickup truck with a 17-year-old boy sitting inside, police said. The engine was still running. The teen, named Jake Brown, told FOX 13 he was startled when Jensen entered the driver’s seat but managed to dodge the hammer that the suspect was swinging. The teen exited just before Jensen drove away.

Jensen fled in the 2007 silver Dodge 3500 Mega Cab pickup truck, which was located by FHP on the Florida Turnpike near Vero Beach.

Just after 4 p.m. Thursday, a trooper spotted a pedestrian that appeared to be “medically distressed,” who turned out to be Jensen. He was spotted along the Turnpike in Okeechobee County. As the trooper walked away from his cruiser to retrieve water for Jensen, the suspect got up and entered the patrol car.

Troopers said Jensen fled in the now stolen 2013 FHP Dodge Charger. Troopers said they did a traffic stop, but as they exited their vehicles to arrest him, Jensen put the stolen cruiser in reverse and attempted to run them over.

Jensen eventually drover into Osceola County, and deputies there deployed stop sticks. They said Jensen attempted to avoid the stop sticks and drove into a grassy median, and stopped against a guardrail.

Troopers said he ran into a nearby wooded area, and was taken into custody. He was taken to a Raulerson Hospital in Okeechobee County, but will be taken to jail when he is medically cleared.

A Palm City student turned an awkward incident into personal profit. Earlier this year, 14-year-old Gunnar Johannsen says he was denied his First Amendment rights while riding the school bus. Gunnar tells WPBF his mission is not only to speak up but to encourage other young people to join in his movement. He created his own apparel business. Gunnar arrived home from school around 3:30 p.m. Thursday. His family’s home office was filled with boxes of blue and white hats and T-shirts with the words ""Boys For Trump,"" designed by Gunnar. “It says Boys for Trump, and it has a surfboard with an American flag and it says First Amendment. I thought that would be cool, and I designed it and it became big,” Gunnar said. Gunnar’s new business stemmed from an incident with a school bus aide. Earlier this year Gunnar participated in a March of Dimes fundraiser. He paid a dollar to wear his Trump hat to school. When he got on the school bus, his bus driver allegedly grabbed his hat off his head. The entire incident was captured on surveillance video. “Whenever I ride on the bus, I remember what happened,” Gunnar said. The Martin County School District suspended the bus aide for four days without pay. She had to undergo training and was moved to another bus route. Meanwhile, Gunnar has replaced his old hat with his own original design. The hats are $25 and the shirts are $20. The profits will go to anyone who has an experience like Gunnar's. Gunnar said up next, he’s working on a new design, “Girls For Trump."" This is a family business. Behind the scenes working on the apparel website is Gunnar’s twin brother, Alexander. Gunnar said in this process, he’s not only learning a thing or two about business, but he is working closely with Ace Specialties, which designed the Make America Great Again hat.

287,Divers search for murder weapon in St. Johns County pond,"Vermount James Anderson (pictured left) was arrested after Everett Thompson (pictured right) was found dead in a pickup truck in rural St. Johns County.

ST. JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. - A dive team is searching a pond in St. Johns County for the weapon that killed a St. Augustine man just before Christmas, the Sheriff's Office said Thursday.

Everett Davon Thompson was found shot to death in a pickup truck on Poa Boy Farms Road off County Road 214 late last year.

Months later, Vermount James Anderson, 37, was charged with first-degree murder in the case.

ORIGINAL STORY: Man found in pickup truck in St. Johns County died of gunshot wound

According to the Sheriff's Office, Anderson owed Thompson several thousand dollars. On the day he was shot, Thompson went to St. Augustine to meet with Anderson and collect the money he was owed.

As the two men met, the Sheriff's Office said, Anderson pulled out a gun and fired a shot through the open door of the pickup truck, killing Thompson.

A Sheriff's Office spokesman said Thursday that the investigation had led detectives to a pond on Holmes Boulevard in the West Augustine area not far from a middle school. Divers were called in to search the pond for the gun used to kill Thompson.

289,Nurse defends parents who defied court order for son's medical treatment,"Related Headlines Missing boy found in Kentucky; being treated

- A day after setting off a multi-state search for a 3-year-old boy, considered by Hillsborough County investigators to be endangered, his parents' choices are igniting a heated debate.

Deputies said the child, Joshua Mcadams, whose parents call him Noah, was in need of life-saving medical care, but his father and mother, Joshua McAdams, 28, and Taylor Bland-Ball, 22, failed to bring him to a court-ordered, medically-necessary hospital procedure April 22.

""Child protective investigators don't always get involved in cases involving a sick kid,"" said Crystal Clark, a spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. ""This wasn't a case of a parent just choosing not to get their child a flu shot. [Investigators] felt like this child was extremely ill, needed medical assistance and, if they didn't intervene, he wasn't going to get it. So, in this case, they felt like if a child's life was at risk, they couldn't just sit back and allow the parents to make a poor decision that could ultimately take his life.""

The family was found Monday in Kentucky and Noah was taken for the treatments he needed. Charges of child neglect are pending for his parents, HCSO said.

In a post on her Facebook page Tuesday afternoon, Bland-Ball wrote, ""We are okay. They are taking Noah. We are on our way back to Florida tonight. Thank you so much for your support. Our hearts our (sic) broken and all we want is for our boy to get HEALTHY BIOLOGICALLY SOUND TREATMENT.""

The family had previously written about Noah's condition on the website for the Florida Freedom Alliance, which is supporting Noah's parents. According to the post, the child was diagnosed with a form of Leukemia and, following two chemotherapy treatments, was cancer-free.

Doctors, however, instructed the family that treatment needed to continue. The parents refused, preferring instead to seek out medical alternatives and then taking their son out of the state. A judge stepped in Monday and ordered them to bring him back for treatment.

""Where does a parent's rights end and where do the government's rights begin?"" asked Erin Marie Olszewski, a registered nurse who runs the Florida Freedom Alliance. ""The government being able to walk in and say, 'You have to be doing this,' is just an overreach of our First Amendment rights. We have that freedom and we should be able to decide what's best.""

FOX 13 medical reporter Dr. Joette Giovinco said the treatment advised by doctors is based on years of research, and has proven to be effective.

""Even though there's no detectable sign of cancer, it does not mean that there are not cancer cells hiding. And so when you treat this type of Leukemia, you treat to remission and then you have to continue treating to make sure it doesn't relapse,"" Dr. Jo said. ""This is a treatment plan that has proven to be effective in not only eliminating cancer initially but also long-term keeping it from coming back. It doesn't mean that it won't but, generally speaking, when cancers do relapse they're harder to treat.""

Noah's parents are scheduled to appear in court Wednesday afternoon. It's unclear who currently has custody of the child and if he's received any further cancer treatments.",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/nurse-defends-parents-who-defied-court-order-for-son-s-medical-treatment,2019-05-01T20:02:28Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609
290,FHP: 3 teens ejected when suspected drunk driver flips van,"COLUMBIA COUNTY, Fla. - A 40-year-old mother has been charged with DUI after three teens were thrown from a van in a rollover crash Tuesday morning on I-10 in Columbia County, troopers said.

None of the teens was wearing a seat belt, according to the Florida Highway Patrol report.

The report said Shemeaka Burnett was driving her Chevy Venture west on I-10 when she lost control for unknown reasons and the van flipped, ejecting an 18-year-old girl, a 16-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl.

The 16-year-old was critically injured and was taken to UF Health Shands Hospital. The 15-year-old suffered serious injuries, and the 18-year-old and Burnett suffered minor injuries.

Social media accounts appear to indicate the teens are Burnett's children. The report lists them as Fayetteville, North Carolina, residents, but News4Jax found records indicating they recently lived in Panama City, Florida.

Burnett is being charged with DUI causing serious bodily injury and careless driving, according to the FHP report.

292,10-year-old boy raises money to help the homeless,"- This weekend a local boy will be raising money to help the homeless.

""My name's Miles and we have miles to go gift bags in the car.""

But it's not for himself, Miles Newbold says these gift bags are for the homeless.

""It makes me feel sad when I see them on the road without a home,"" he said.

His mom, Danielle, says they've already handed out more than 2,200 gift bags to the homeless in Orlando.

Now, they're going from gift bags to shopping bags.

Miles and his Mom will be raising donations at Bloomingdale's during a family fun event.

They say the store will also sell their T-shirts and donate 10 percent of proceeds on the day of the event.

The boy's mother said another company donated 5,000 pairs of socks to put in the bags.

""It makes them feel valued, and there's a card that says you matter, and it's signed by the person that packed the bag,"" she said.

Miles and his mom say it makes a difference.

""I've seen somebody take out the toothbrush and brush their teeth right away.""

The 'Miles to Go' event takes place on Saturday at Bloomingdale's at the Mall at Millenia.

The family of 10-year-old Kevin Pope is expected to hold a press conference on Tuesday morning, as they plead for the public's assistance in identifying the semi-truck driver. Pope's family, including his mother, will be in attendance.

Law enforcement is reportedly still working tirelessly to identify the trucking company, the truck, and the driver involved in the incident. The Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) is assisting.

FHP is not calling it a “hit and run” because that implies the driver knowingly hit someone and kept going.

296,"Ohio boy, 8, who saved himself and sister from kidnapping is praised for quick thinking","- A police department in Ohio is praising the actions of an 8-year-old boy after he saved himself and his sister from an attempted kidnapping on Thursday when their grandmother's vehicle was stolen.

The incident happened in Middletown, Ohio after the children's grandmother had gotten out of the vehicle while taking another woman into the emergency room at a hospital and 24-year-old Dalvir Singh jumped into the driver's seat.

That spurred the boy, identified by Middletown Police as Chance, and his sister Skylar to take action as the vehicle sped away.

""This little guy is a hero. No question,"" Middletown Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw said in a statement. ""He pulled his sister out of the car with no concern for his own safety. That is incredible at his age and outstanding work by Officers Kirby and Engleka to find the suspect and take him down without incident.""

As the vehicle began to take off, Chance opened the door of the vehicle to escape as his sister attempted to jump until Singh grabbed the girl's hoodie, according to police.

""We both started screaming and then my grandma went out and grabbed a hold of the car and he just kept opening and shutting the door trying to get her off,"" Chance told FOX19.

Her brother was eventually able to grab a hold of her and pulled her away from the 24-year-old, sending both children tumbling out of the car in a moment that was captured on surveillance video.

""What do you see here? If three heroes was the answer then you are correct!"" police said in a Facebook post.

""Chance made sure that he and his sister Skylar got out of their car when it was stolen,"" police said. ""They weren't about to be taken by some stranger!""

The grandmother of the children, 69-year-old Nita Coburn, made a valiant effort to save the kids by trying to grab onto a door before being dragged. Coburn did not suffer any serious injuries after the incident, according to FOX19.

Singh, who police said is addicted to heroin, was taken into custody and charged with two counts of kidnapping, felonious assault and grand theft.

297,"Endangered Tampa boy, 3, who needs medical treatment found in Kentucky","Kentucky authorities took into custody an endangered 3-year-old boy on Monday, hours after Hillsborough deputies said his parents refused to provide him with the medical treatment he needs and instead fled Florida with the child.

TAMPA — Kentucky authorities took into custody an endangered 3-year-old boy on Monday, hours after Hillsborough deputies said his parents refused to provide him with the medical treatment he needs and instead fled Florida with the child.

Joshua “Noah” McAdams was found in Georgetown, Ky., and underwent medical treatment in that state, according to the Hilsborough County Sheriff's Office. The parents are also in custody and will face charges of child neglect.

Georgetown is about 20 minutes north of Lexington. But no information about how the Tampa family was located or captured in Kentucky was released by Florida authorities.

During the search, father Joshua McAdams, 28, was described as armed and dangerous by the Sheriff’s Office. He may have had several rifles with him, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. He was arrested for misdemeanor domestic battery in Hernando County in 2016, but the charge was later dropped.

The exact medical diagnosis and condition for Noah, which is the name the child goes by, was not released by deputies due to health privacy laws. They also did not say why the family refused to seek medical treatment.

But posts on a Facebook page in his mother’s name tell the story of her son’s cancer — and credit his recovery to vitamins, diet and other alternative treatment options.

Child protective investigators obtained a court order to take the boy into custody, the Sheriff’s Office said. But when they went to serve the order, the family had disappeared.

On April 22, according to deputies, mother Taylor Bland-Ball, 22, and the father failed to bring their son in for a “medically necessary” procedure. They also refused to come to a follow-up medical appointment to obtain the “lifesaving medical care” the child needs, according to the Sheriff's Office.

Noah may also have a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC line, in his body.

In early April, posts on the Facebook page noted Bland-Ball’s “baby boy” was at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital and had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Then on April 16, six days before the couple missed their medical appointment, a celebratory post on the Facebook page appears to show Bland-Ball and her son smiling, noting that they “busted on out of that hospital — with no cancer cells left to spare.”

“We did two rounds of chemotherapy, specifically vincristine because they can get a medical court order to force you to do it,” the post reads, before crediting other remedies, from rosemary to grapefruit peel.

Posts on the Facebook page, which was active as of late Monday afternoon, became home to small arguments between people angry at the parents’ actions and others defending them.

The page links to the websites of two businesses: Trinity Caim Birth Services and Herbal Education & Training. Both list “Taylor Bland” as employees. A number for Trinity Caim Birth Services is also listed on separate records for Joshua McAdams. A call from the Tampa Bay Times to the number went unanswered Monday afternoon.

The most recent address for the family was on the 12200 block of Bruce B. Downs Boulevard in Tampa, near University Mall. The Sheriff’s Office said the parents are also known to sleep in state parks overnight.

In August 2016, McAdams was arrested on a charge of misdemeanor domestic battery by Brooksville police. The victim in the case was Bland-Ball, the report said, and it took place while they lived in Brooksville and had been dating for three years. The incident started with McAdams arguing with Bland-Ball, who was holding their son, then just a year old, according to the arrest report.

The father threw a plastic toy bucket at the mother but accidentally hit the baby, cutting his face. McAdams then shoved his girlfriend into a wall “multiple times,” causing a head contusion, the report said. He spent three days in jail, records show, and the case was dropped in March 2017. The mother also filed for a protective injunction against the father, according to Hernando court records, but it was later dismissed.

Seven-month-old JT Borofka of Salinas, California, is one of 60 people worldwide diagnosed with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, an extremely rare disease that is life-threatening. TPI is a genetic, multisystem disorder with complications like respiratory and heart failure. In addition to the TPI, he has hemolytic anemia, which is premature destruction of red blood cells in the body which requires blood transfusions.As the disease progresses, other symptoms include neurological damage that can lead to paralysis, and intellectual disability, tremors and dystonia. “We believe, and the doctors believe, that he’s the first person to be detected with this very rare disease before the neurological and major symptoms start,” said Jason Borofka, the JT Borofka's father.The boy is Tara and Jason Borofka's only child.They said when he was 2 months old, their pediatrician detected low iron and oxygen levels in JT Borofka’s blood and sent them to Stanford Children’s Hospital in Palo Alto. He was diagnosed with TPI in March after five months of grueling testing. It was a gene panel test that confirmed the TPI diagnosis.“Our doctors at Stanford and their team are scrambling to come up with a cure or some type of treatment for our son,” Jason Borofka said.There is no known cure or course of treatment for TPI, and this is the first case ever documented in the state of California. “The doctors gave him two to five years to live, and he said it's going to be very tough on us and that it was going to be horrible. We cried for a solid week, for sure, but now we’re holding on tight and we’re going to try and beat this,” Borofka said.Later this month, JT Borofka will be admitted to Stanford Hospital for a week where doctors will try an experimental ketogenic diet to see if it improves his iron and oxygen levels.The Borofkas go to Stanford weekly, where he routinely has his blood drawn. “The struggle is how many times he has to get his blood drawn. There isn’t a parent out there that can stand watching their kid getting his blood drawn,” Jason Borofka said. It is the couple's hope that by sharing their son’s story, it will raise awareness about TPI and ultimately lead to a treatment or cure. “It’s more important that we’re building awareness, especially around our little community and we’re really building a team. Awareness is almost more important than raising all the money,” he said.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/7-month-old-diagnosed-with-disease-so-rare-it-has-no-cure-or-treatment/27361535,2019-05-04T03:50:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
305,Crystal Lake Elementary in Lakeland partnering with community to help students,"“We just want to see the children thrive.” — Crystal Lake Elementary Principal Kristan Fowler

LAKELAND — The sounds of hammering could be heard Thursday coming from two portables on the Crystal Lake Elementary School campus. Workmen continue to transform the buildings into a community clinic that will be available beginning Monday to the school’s 470 students, as well as their parents, neighbors and anyone who walks through the door.

“Our target audience is the 33801 zip code,” said Andrea Hagan, director of the unique community partnership with the school. The clinic will have a doctor, nurse practitioner and dentist on staff and will take health insurance as well as payments on a sliding scale of ability to pay. “Our families were predominantly receiving health care at the emergency room, so there was not preventative care or follow-up care.”

Hagan graduated from Southeastern University with degrees in elementary education and psychology and has spent many years working for Florida Baptist Children’s Home and then Heartland for Children, one of the five core partners with the school. The others are nearby Southeastern University, United Way of Central Florida, Central Florida Health Care, all working with Polk County Public Schools on the project.

Crystal Lake was awarded the community school pilot program two years ago, with core partners signing a 25-year memorandum of understanding, promising to provide financial support, medical and social aid, along with academic enhancement for several generations. They are providing after-school tutoring and will have before-school help, along with weekend academic help at the school as they build more partnerships. The tutoring is available outside of regular school hours because all of the students live in the working-class neighborhood around the school.

It is designed to break the cycle of poverty and improve student performance, based on similar programs in Hillsborough and Orange counties.

""No one can do their best in school or at work when they are hungry, sick or in pain,"" said Christina Criser, CEO of United Way of Central Florida. ""The holistic services at the Crystal Lake Community Partnership School addresses needs for students, families, and the community at large.""

Crystal Lake Elementary Principal Kristan Fowler said there is already an impact.

“The discipline (issue) has come down,” Fowler said, noting there are fewer referrals to the office and suspensions. “I start talking about it and I get so emotional — all these opportunities for our children here.”

Fowler has more than two decades of education experience and is in her second year as a principal. She was an assistant principal at Boswell Elementary in Auburndale and has spent time teaching fifth, third and first grades.

It is difficult to nail down an exact program cost, but three positions filled this year, along with contracted services, cost about $420,000, with the George Jenkins Foundation and the Iron Horse Foundation donating through United Way. The Givewell Foundation and Publix charities have also donated funding.

In addition to Hagan, there is a health and wellness coordinator, along with a parents and family engagement coordinator.

The groups and businesses send in volunteers to read with kindergartners and help students plant and tend to a vegetable and flower garden. They also provide food and clothing to the Title I students, most of whom qualify for free or reduced cost lunches. The Girl Scouts are on campus, as is Central Florida Health Care’s Mobile Kitchen to teach families about healthy and nutritious eating. A recent partnership and pizza event saw 250 people show up.

Classes are going to be offered for parents, based on things they have said they want, including financial, job and computer training, along with English language classes because foreign-born families want to assimilate.

Fowler and Hagan said some students are dealing with more than poverty: Some have educational or learning challenges, there are behavior issues, many come from single-parent homes or abusive situations, and some routinely go hungry.

Two fifth-graders who have attended the school for several years have seen a positive change.

“I got suspended for fighting,” said 11-year-old Enrique Hernandez, explaining the punishment straightened out his behavior. “I should not fight because school is not for fighting, it’s for learning. I’ve never been back to the office.”

He was one of four students rewarded for his improved behavior and grades with VIP treatment at a recent Lakeland Magic game.

“Kindness reminds the kids that they’re special, that they can succeed,” Hagan said.

Fowler and Hagan have implemented a positive behavior program based on “houses,” like in Harry Potter books. Their houses are based on character traits and are called Courage, Perseverance, Integrity and Loyalty. They even have their own T-shirts. The house with most points at the end of the school year is getting a trip to Legoland.

Shaelynn Cox, 11, said the positive behavior program has helped her be a better student and classmate.

“I’ve gotten extra recess, ice cream,” Shaelynn said. When asked what the best part of Crystal Lake Elementary is, she said, “Getting to learn — the teachers are nice.”

As Fowler walked down a sidewalk, students darted to her side, arms outstretched for hugs. Fowler says she worries about her students even when she is not at school, adding there is one little boy whom she never sees smile.

“I just want to take him home and rock him and tell him, ‘You’re going to grow up and be somebody important,’” Fowler said. “We just want to see the children thrive.”

306,"Popular Fort Myers statues leaving downtown, moving all over the city","They might be the most popular residents of downtown Fort Myers: The chess players. The juggler. The dancer. Even the dude peeing on the lamp post.

Especially the dude peeing on the lamp post.

“That one’s very popular!” says Robin Harkey, 64, of North Fort Myers, who works in downtown Fort Myers and has a clear view of the man and his dog on Hendry Street. “People are always taking photos of it, and they’re posing all the time.”

Those larger-than-life statues are always out on the street, doing their thing.

But not for much longer.

Most of the 24 metal statues will soon head to other places in Fort Myers. It’s part of a plan by Fort Myers' Public Art Committee to disperse the city's public-art collection to areas outside of downtown, where most of that collection is concentrated.

“We want to spread out the art we’ve acquired to all six wards,” says longtime committee member Ava Roeder. “I think it’s really exciting.”

The idea is to create miniature “art hubs” throughout the city featuring the artfully rusted statues by Colombian sculptor Edgardo Carmona, says Tom Hall, the city’s public art consultant. The hubs will feature signs and information about connecting to Otocast, a mobile app that will include information about the statues and the rest of the city’s public art collection.

Councilwoman Gaile Anthony says the move will bring more culture to all six wards, including her own Ward 6, where she hopes to place statues at a park planned for The Forum shopping center. That culture is much needed in her ward, she says.

“There’s no art,” she says. “There’s no library. There’s nothing.”

Spreading the art around will help create a feeling of unity in Fort Myers, too, she says. Now everyone can share the art and take pride in it.

“This ties us all together as city,” Anthony says.

The statues arrived in the River District in 2016 as part of a publicity campaign for downtown luxury condominiums Allure (that’s why the collection was previously called “Allure Your Senses”). They were supposed to stay for just three months. But then the exhibit got extended. And then it got extended again.

Finally, last August, the Fort Myers City Council voted to buy 23 of those statues for $55,000 and make them permanent residents of Fort Myers (the 24th sculpture would be part of the Allure condominium complex). The purchase wasn’t publicized much, though, and many people still don’t know the city owns the statues.

Victoria Yoraschek, 37, walks by them every day on her way to work on First Street, but she says she had no idea the statues were city property now.

“It’s really cool,” the Fort Myers resident says. “They add to the atmosphere in downtown, along with Art Walk and some of the galleries.”

Now some of that atmosphere will be leaving and taking up residence elsewhere. And Lee County residents have mixed opinions about the move, judging from people interviewed recently by The News-Press in downtown.

“I think they should stay here,” says Richard Ahlborn, 74, of Cape Coral as he sips coffee outside of Starbucks. “They belong together. It’s just part of the culture in downtown now.”

But Terry Tincher — a local art dealer who works as general manager at the new Seed & Bean Market — likes the idea of the entire city gaining access to the sculptures. Besides, he says, there are way too many of those statues jammed into downtown right now.

“It’s crazy to have 24 sculptures in a seven-block area,” says Tincher, 63, of Fort Myers. “They’re just stacked on top of each other, and that takes away from the artistic flair for the city. There are just too many.”

Eight of the statues will remain in downtown Fort Myers, while the other 15 will get split evenly among the city’s other five awards. Where they’ll be going, exactly, is still being worked out.

The statues staying in downtown will include the unicycle juggler, the boy fishing, the snow-cone vendor, the ribbon dancer, the two drunks on a park bench, the man listening to a radio and — yes — the man and his dog urinating against a light post.

When that last statue debuted in 2016, some people didn’t like it and considered the man’s exposed penis to be obscene. But city leaders and the Public Art Committee discussed the statue (officially called “Territorio” or “territory”) and decided to keep it, says Donna Lovejoy, the city’s public art liaison.

“Art is art,” Lovejoy says,” and it shouldn’t be censored.”

Besides, she points out, that statue remains one of the most popular ones in downtown. People are always posing for photos next to that man and his dog at the corner of Hendry and Main streets, Lovejoy says. “That’s always been a huge conversation piece — good, bad or indifferent.”

The rest of the statues could all be moved permanently within the next nine months, Hall says. City officials are still working out the details, including how much the move will cost and how, exactly, the statues will be moved. Each statue weighs between 200 and about 1,000 pounds and stands 7 to 10 feet tall.

The statues' creator, Edgardo Carmona, didn’t respond to several requests for comment via his daughter Carolina Carmona Montenegro, who was serving as an interpreter for The News-Press. But Hall, Anderson and other city officials say Carmona has said he doesn’t want the collection broken up.

“The artist hates the idea,” Hall says. “He wants to see his 23 pieces all kept together in close proximity. The committee, though, felt that it’s imperative that all of the wards be able to participate in the artworks.”

Carmona visited the city in January 2016 for the unveiling of the statues. Through an interpreter, the Spanish-speaking artist said he built the statues using hydraulic machines, sandblasting and a special method to remove the calamine from the rust and stop the oxidation process.

The rust, he said, gives each piece a pleasing, colorful patina. “It’s intentional.”

The city bought the collection from Carmona for $55,000. Lovejoy, however, says the statues were technically “donated” to the city. She estimated that they’re worth at least $20,000 or $30,000 each, but Carmona only required that the city reimburse him for the cost of the steel, alone.

“We really got them for a steal — all of them for just $55,000,” says committee member Roeder. “That’s crazy!”

Mayor Randy Henderson says he considers that money well-spent. “The sculptures have created excitement, interest, controversy, discussion and much more in downtown and beyond.”

He’s a fan, too. “I find the sculptures quite interesting, playful, a snapshot of life, vitality, action, whimsical, etc.,” he says. “It contributes to our quality of life in Fort Myers.”

Councilwoman Teresa Watkins Brown says she loves the idea of all Fort Myers residents getting to enjoy Carmona’s art — not just the people who visit downtown.

“(They) will now receive the benefit of seeing art displayed in their neighborhoods or wards,” she says. “I feel this is a great move by our city to share the pieces around.”

Meanwhile, the statues continue to be a big draw to downtown Fort Myers.

“They’re very popular picture subjects,” Lovejoy says. “Young or old, it doesn’t matter.”

308,What's the weird rash going around Polk County?,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Polk County parents are reporting a rash of rashes making its way through some schools. With measles a hot topic across the country, the bumps have some parents concerned.

A spokesperson for Polk County Schools told News Channel 8 Thursday the district was aware of some rashes being reported but there was no concern of an outbreak.

Megan Lambert's son Chris woke up last Thursday covered from head to toe in mysterious red bumps. She said the third grader couldn't stop scratching his burning skin.

""It was all on my head, all the way down to my waist,"" the boy explained.

At first Lambert feared measles, even though her son is vaccinated.

""I wanted answers,"" she said. ""I wanted to know what it was.""

After two trips to the doctor, they had a diagnosis...fifth disease.

You may not have heard of it, but Dr. Richard Frates at Lakeland's Watson Clinic said roughly 50 percent of people have had the viral disease at some point. He says he's seen a few cases in his office the last few weeks.

Frates explained there's no vaccine for fifth disease because unlike measles, it is relatively mild and doesn't cause other dangerous complications. However, fifth disease is contagious before a trace of the rash even breaks out, meaning it's easy for kids and families to be exposed without realizing.

Lambert said a number of her friends' kids have broken out in similar rashes, diagnosed as fifth disease.

A week later, Chris said he's almost feeling good as new except for sensitivity to light and heat. His mom just hopes now her older son isn't her second kid to come down with the fifth.

Because fifth disease is viral, there's not much parents can do besides let kids rest up and let the virus run its course.

However, it can be problematic for pregnant women so if you experience the symptoms, you should give your doctor a call.",https://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/what-s-the-weird-rash-going-around-polk-county-/1974902230,2019-05-03T02:21:51Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
311,Police took a cancer-stricken toddler from his parents. Their supporters call it a 'medical kidnapping.',"""MISSING ENDANGERED CHILD!"" read an urgent alert from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office that blasted across the news.

Less than two weeks after 3-year-old Noah was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, his mother claimed the cancer was gone.

""We busted out of that hospital - with no cancer cells left to spare,"" Taylor Bland-Ball wrote on Facebook on April 16. ""Doctors are amazed at his speedy healing and strength!""

The 22-year-old holistic birth attendant from Tampa said her son had undergone two rounds of chemotherapy - ""because they can get a medical court order to force you to do it anyways for a child with his diagnosis"" - but also tried a number of home remedies. Rosemary and colloidal silver, reishi mushroom tea and bitter apricot seeds, to name a few. ""This is one of our many alternative therapies for healing. #NatureHeals,"" she wrote.

But by Monday, police were telling a different story about Noah's healing progress.

""MISSING ENDANGERED CHILD!"" read an urgent alert from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office that blasted across the news.

""On April 22, 2019 the parents failed to bring in the child to a medically necessary hospital procedure,"" the sheriff's office wrote, naming Bland-Ball and her husband, Joshua McAdams. ""The parents have further refused to follow up with the life saving medical care the child needs.""

The alert launched a nationwide hunt for the couple and their son, Noah, a toddler with long curly brown hair and big brown eyes. In a matter of hours, they were located in Georgetown, Kentucky. Noah was taken from his parents and was ""now being medically treated,"" the sheriff's office said in an update. And his parents, meanwhile, were being investigated on suspicion of child neglect.

Since then, the case has attracted national attention as Bland-Ball and McAdams insist they were trying to find their son alternative medical care, accusing the police and medical officials of stripping them of the right to choose their own treatment plan for their son. Their supporters call the state's decision to take custody of Noah a ""medical kidnapping"" - a term that's become common in communities skeptical of traditional medicine when authorities take drastic measures to provide medical care they see as essential to the child's well-being.

The parents await a custody hearing Friday.

""We're not trying to refuse any kind of treatment,"" Bland-Ball told reporters Wednesday, according to WFLA. ""They think we're refusing treatment all around, putting him in danger, trying to kill him. But not at all. We're trying to save him.""

Experts have warned against stopping treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, however.

Bijal D. Shah, who leads Tampa's Moffitt Cancer Center's acute lymphoblastic leukemia program, told the Tampa Bay Times that the treatment has been remarkably successful, with a cure rate of 90 percent - but that it can require two-and-a-half years of chemotherapy. Stopping the treatment early, he said, means the cancer will almost always come back.

""I put it in the same box as those who fear vaccination,"" he told the newspaper. ""The reality is, what we risk by not taking chemotherapy, just as what we risk by not taking vaccines, is much, much worse.""

But an organization fighting on Bland-Ball and McAdams's behalf, Florida Freedom Alliance, which supports ""vaccine freedom,"" argues that the couple should be entitled to ""medical freedom"" and freedom from ""medical kidnappings.""

Modern medicine skeptics have recently claimed ""medical kidnappings"" in a whole range of scenarios, including among the anti-vaccination groups. Bland-Ball and her husband's case unfolds at a time when so-called anti-vaxxers are clashing with authorities seeking to stop a measles outbreak not seen in decades amid a spread of misinformation about vaccines. In some locations, such as Rockland County, N.Y., authorities have enforced court orders banning unvaccinated children from attending school.

In one notable case in February, police in Chandler, Ariz., busted down a family's door in the middle of the night with their guns drawn to seize a dangerously feverish, unvaccinated 2-year-old and bring him to the hospital. The boy's mother had reportedly ignored a doctor's orders and refused to take him to the emergency room, fearing authorities would report her for failing to vaccinate the boy.

In New York, child protection authorities took custody of a 12-year-old boy fighting leukemia last September after his mother refused additional chemotherapy treatment. The mother, Candace Gunderson, told News 12 Long Island that she took her son to Florida for alternative holistic treatment, but that when authorities found out, her son was seized and returned to New York to continue chemotherapy. She lost custody, she said, calling it a ""medical kidnapping.""

""They don't want me to be able to exercise my freedoms to choose medical treatment for my child,"" Gunderson told the news station.

Nonprofits such as the American Cancer Society have long warned against such ""alternative"" treatments.

In a January article, the American Cancer Society noted that about 40 percent of Americans believe cancer can be cured through alternative, unproven therapies alone, citing a 2018 survey by the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

""This is alarming,"" the cancer society noted, citing the study's findings, ""because evidence shows that people who use alternative therapies in place of standard cancer treatments have much higher death rates.""

Bland-Ball has said that she did not want to continue chemotherapy for her son because it was invasive, and since she believed the cancer had gone into remission, she did not believe it was necessary anymore.

""We want him to receive a treatment that has less side effects, because chemotherapy is so brutal on a body, even an adult body, so think of what it's doing to a little person who's only 30 pounds,"" she told reporters Wednesday. ""We want to get him something that's healthier, that is more biologically sound for him, specific to him and not just a standard protocol that they use for everybody, because he's an individual.""

She and McAdams said that's what they were looking for in Kentucky. Before they left for Kentucky, photos on Bland-Ball's Facebook feed show her taking him to the beach and feeding him grapefruit for ""Vitamin D & Vitamin C Therapy"" and trying organic juices and Madagascar periwinkle plants. Once they were apprehended in Kentucky, Bland-Ball defended herself on Facebook, writing, ""No neglect here considering his levels are the best they've ever been and still cancer free after two weeks without chemotherapy - shocker!""

Since they were apprehended by police, Noah's parents say they have not seen him and do not know where he is or how he is being cared for, medically or otherwise.

""I haven't slept,"" she told reporters Wednesday. ""I've eaten one banana. I've been a total anxious mess, not being able to do anything except think about him, think about what I can do to help speed up this process to just see him again and know what's going on.""

Dozens of supporters have rallied around the family, some of whom have attacked the police for taking the 3-year-old into custody.

""Medical kidnapping is real!"" one wrote on Facebook in response to the police's urgent ""MISSING ENDANGERED CHILD!"" alert.

Katherine Drabiak, an assistant professor of bioethics and genomics at the University of South Florida, told WFTS that if courts and police step in to take a child into custody for medical reasons, it is considered ""absolutely a last resort."" She said it is worth scrutinizing whether additional chemotherapy was warranted in this case, but that the state ""has a duty"" to step in if it feels a child is at risk.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190502/police-took-cancer-stricken-toddler-from-his-parents-their-supporters-call-it-medical-kidnapping?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T14:20:00Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
313,Deaf rescue dog learns sign language after 'fairy tale' adoption by man who is also deaf,"A man born deaf adopted a puppy who is also deaf in a story ""with an absolute fairy tale ending.""

Nick Abbott, 31, told WABI-5 that he saw a Facebook post about Emerson from NFR Maine, a foster-based dog rescue.

""I said, 'Oh, he's deaf, too,'"" Abbott told the TV station. ""Maybe I can go check him out to see what he's all about.""

Emerson was rescued from Florida when he was 6 weeks old. He had experienced seizures and was infected with canine parvovirus, a contagious virus affecting dogs that can be fatal if left untreated.

""Once we got him home from the vet's office from Florida, we realized he had hearing difficulties,"" Lindsay Powers with NFR Maine told Good Morning America on Tuesday. ""He had such a rough start to life.""

Cute alert: Blind dog gets his own 'seeing eye' dog. Excuse us, we can't see through happy tears

All of Emerson's siblings were adopted quickly, but ""our sweet boy Emerson"" was still looking for a home, the dog rescue group said in its Facebook post.

""He wants everyone to know that even though he may be deaf, he is still an AMAZING little pup with SOO much love to give!""

When Abbott first visited Emerson, the dog came right to him and sat at his feet, Abbott told WABI-5.

""He kind of picked me. And I knew right then and there that we would get along and understand each other pretty good,"" he said.

Americans loves labs: They're the top dog breed for the 28th year in a row, says AKC

Since then, Abbott has been teaching Emerson sign language commands.

The letter S is ""sit,"" and sweeping his hand across in a straight line is ""lie down,"" WABI-5 reported.

""If Nick reaches up and shakes his ear lobe, Emerson will bark – it's so cute,"" Abbott's mom, Richelle, told Good Morning America.

""The bond that we have is awesome,"" Abbott told WABI-5. ""We understand each other very well. I'd like to think it was meant to be. He's special.""

The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office reported Monday that the boy was due for a medically necessary procedure at a hospital but the parents failed to bring him in on April 22.

“The parents have further refused to follow up with the life saving medical care the child needs,” the Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post. Officials said the father of the boy could be armed.

The boy, Joshua McAdams, is about three feet tall and 30 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes.

The parents are his mother, Taylor Bland-Ball, 22, and father, Joshua McAdams, 27, according to the sheriff’s office. She is a 5-foot-6, 125-pound white woman with blue eyes and brown hair. He is a 5-foot-9, 155-pound white man with black hair and brown eyes.

The family may be traveling in a silver 2016 Mazda CX-5 with Florida take DERX82.

322,‘This little guy is a hero': Ohio boy saves sister from kidnapping,"MIDDLETOWN, OH (WCMH) -- A boy in Middletown, Ohio is being called a hero after he pulled his sister from a moving car, preventing her from being kidnapped.

At about 4:18 pm, April 25, the Middletown Division of Police received a call about a car with children inside had been stolen at Atrium Medical Center and an elderly lady was injured.

According to police, an 8-year-old boy and his 10-year-old sister were in the backseat of a vehicle that their grandmother had driven to the hospital as she brought another woman to the emergency room.

While the grandmother was helping the other woman into the emergency room, a man jumped into the car with the children and began driving off.

The 8-year-old boy opened the door to escape but when he began pulling his sister out as well, the suspect grabbed the girl’s hoodie to pull her back in.

Police say the little boy didn’t' give up and was eventually able to pull his sister out of the moving vehicle.

The grandmother was injured in the incident when she tried to stop the suspect by grabbing a hold of the car and was dragged a short distance.

Officers Kirby and Engleka with Middletown Police would later see the stolen vehicle and stop it where they arrested the suspect, 24-year-old Dalvir Singh from India.

Singh has been charged with two counts of kidnapping, felonious assault for dragging the grandmother, and grand theft.

""This little guy is a hero. No question. He pulled his sister out of the car with no concern for his own safety. That is incredible at his age and outstanding work by Officers Kirby and Engleka to find the suspect and take him down without incident. So proud of their work,"" said Middletown Division of Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw.

Police say they are planning on honoring the little boy for his bravery in saving his sister’s life.",http://www.wfla.com/news/national/this-little-guy-is-a-hero-ohio-boy-saves-sister-from-kidnapping/1963106092,2019-04-29T10:55:21Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

324,MUELLER REPORT: Russian connections abound in Florida,"Florida played a starring role in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s final redacted report on Thursday with Russian-linked actors trying to use the Sunshine State to influence the 2016 election in favor of Republican candidate Donald Trump.

There may be no legal basis to claim Trump colluded with the Russians, but one need only look at the Florida connections to see plenty of smoke.

“We’re not immune, especially if you’re in a swing state,” said U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach. “The Russians are not going to stop trying to interfere with our democracy. It’s going to keep happening, and (there) could be other countries trying to do it as well.”

Florida made an appearance in the report 31 times. The highlights included:

Trump rallies in Florida were staged by Russian entities. A shadowy Russian-born figure assured a high-level Donald Trump campaign adviser that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would ensure victory in the general election — as well as the allegiance of Russian President Vladimir Putin. A pro-Russian Ukrainian also shopped dirt on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to Roger Stone, a Trump confidante now under indictment. But no reference to the Sunshine State was more disturbing than the fact that the FBI believes a Russian military intelligence agency was able to gain access to the elections network of one Florida county.

The Russians in November 2016 sent spearphishing emails containing malicious malware to more than 120 accounts of Florida elections officials.

The state reached out to the FBI, but the bureau declined to say which county was in the cross-hairs and Mueller’s report said his investigators didn’t take time to chase it down.

>> READ THE MUELLER REPORT HERE

U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton, addressed the Russian spearphishing.

“Whether it’s county government or the servers at the DNC, the Russians looked for every way to influence the election,” he said. “We know that that’s the goal in 2020. There’s nothing partisan about working together to block the Russians from affecting our election.”

Then there is Felix Sater, one of the more colorful characters in the 448 pages of the Mueller report.

The Moscow-born confederate of Trump in a Fort Lauderdale condo project leaves a large footprint, his name dropped 104 times in the report.

Sater emailed self-proclaimed Trump fixer Michael Cohen about putting together a Trump Tower project in Moscow.

As Sater and Cohen worked on Trump Tower Moscow, Sater mused in a Nov. 3, 2015 email about how the skyscraper could boost Trump’s presidential prospects, according to the report.

“Sater emailed Cohen suggesting that the Trump Moscow project could be used to increase candidate Trump’s chances at being elected, writing: ’Buddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it.’”

Sater goes on to say: “I will get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this, I will manage this process. ... Putin gets on stage with Donald for a ribbon cutting for Trump Moscow, and Donald owns the republican nomination.”

The Sater-Trump Fort Lauderdale project in 2005 was never completed and resulted in lawsuits, with some potential buyers suing Trump personally for damages. Sater ended up in a rent-free office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower in New York, brokering connections between the Trump family and Russian elites.

Sater was scheduled to speak in front of the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees in March on the Moscow real estate deal, but it was postponed.

In another Cohen email, Sater talks about how Putin and Trump would hit it off:

“Donald doesn’t stare down, he negotiates and understands the economic issues and Putin only want to deal with a pragmatic leader, and a successful business man is a good candidate for someone who knows how to negotiate. Business, politics, whatever it all is the same for someone who knows how to deal.”

>>Trump in Palm Beach: President claims Mueller offers ‘total exoneration’

U.S. Attorney General William Barr, in a news conference Thursday morning, repeatedly said there was no collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia. However, that didn’t preclude Trump from using the fruits of Russia’s labor.

This is borne out in the first reference to Florida on page 39 of the report, which describes the actions of the Internet Research Agency, a Russian entity that was ultimately indicted for election interference.

The report noted that the IRA focused intently on the 2016 election promoting the Trump Campaign and opposing the Clinton Campaign, including a series of pro-Trump rallies in Florida in August 2016.

The Florida rallies drew the attention of the Trump campaign, which posted about the Miami rally on candidate Trump’s Facebook account.

Probably, the most well-known Florida connection in the report was former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who has a $1.5 million home in Palm Beach Gardens and 16 pages of the report are dedicated to him.

The investigation did not establish that Manafort coordinated with the Russian government’s election interference efforts. The report, however, does detail Manafort’s role with Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort employee who the FBI determined had ties with Russian intelligence, according to the report.

Manafort has since acknowledged he was a “backdoor” means for Russia to control eastern Ukraine, according to the report. Trump told Mueller in a written response that he did not remember Manafort talking to him about positions that the Ukraine or Russia would want the U.S. to support.

Manafort was convicted of financial fraud for work he did years earlier in Ukraine on behalf of pro-Russian political figures. A judge also found he lied to Mueller’s office after pledging to cooperate.

Despite that, Manafort will be allowed to keep his home in BallenIsles but will forfeit his New York homes, worth an estimated $22 million.

Another Florida character, the always flamboyant Roger Stone who lives in Fort Lauderdale, also had Russian ties.

Stone, indicted on charges of lying to investigators, met in the spring of 2016 with a Ukrainian who offered to sell the Trump campaign financial documents that he claimed showed Hillary Clinton had laundered money through his companies, according to the report.

>> RELATED: Roger Stone in West Palm Beach: ‘I will never roll on Donald Trump’

After being told that the alleged documents would show Clinton laundered hundreds of thousands of dollars, not millions, Stone refused to buy the information from Alexei Rasin, a Ukrainian involved in South Florida real estate, Mueller said.

“Stone refused the offer, stating that Trump would not pay for opposition research,” Mueller wrote.

However, the Russian who introduced Stone and Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo to Rasin told investigators that he doubted the damaging documents existed.

Russian Henry Oknyansky, a Hallandale Beach resident who also goes by the name of Greenberg, said Rasin had tried to sell the information to others without success.

While Florida records show that Rasin had companies in both Sunny Isles Beach and Naples, they have been inactive for years. Investigators confirmed Rasin has a valid Florida driver’s license, but Mueller said they were unable to find him anywhere in the United States.

“The Office otherwise was unable to determine the content and origin of the information he purportedly offered to Stone,” Mueller wrote. “Finally, the investigation did not identify evidence of a connection between the outreach or the meeting and Russian interference efforts.”

One Russian with Florida and Trump ties, oligarch Dimitry Rybolovlev, was not in the report. He bought a Palm Beach mansion from Trump in 2008 for $95 million, a sharp increase from the $41 million Trump had paid for the property just four years earlier.

Rybolovlev divided the property into three parcels, two of which he has sold for a combined $71 million. The purchase is one of several Trump business transactions that were reported to be under investigation by Mueller.

Palm Beach Post reporters Christine Stapleton, Lulu Ramadan and Chris Persaud contributed to this report.

Well, April has come and gone in a dizzying, colorful blur. Literature, film, music, dance, theater, art — all the cultural bases were covered in one of the most delightful spring months in memory.

Now it’s time to take a breath and contemplate the change in seasons. Summer is a-coming in, friends. The pace will slow to a mosey and there will be time to kick back and contemplate the clouds and the waves, the tomatoes in your garden and the inside of your eyelids.

Which is not to say the cultural whirl ceases - it eases back to more of a gentle eddy. There’s still plenty of music, theater (“Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!”) and more in store. It just won’t come in a big rush — it’ll be more like a soft summer breeze caressing your cheek.

337,Crystal Lake Elementary partnering with community to help students,"“We just want to see the children thrive.” — Crystal Lake Elementary Principal Kristan Fowler

LAKELAND — The sounds of hammering could be heard Thursday coming from two portables on the Crystal Lake Elementary School campus. Workmen continue to transform the buildings into a community clinic that will be available beginning Monday to the school’s 470 students, as well as their parents, neighbors and anyone who walks through the door.

“Our target audience is the 33801 zip code,” said Andrea Hagan, director of the unique community partnership with the school. The clinic will have a doctor, nurse practitioner and dentist on staff and will take health insurance as well as payments on a sliding scale of ability to pay. “Our families were predominantly receiving health care at the emergency room, so there was not preventative care or follow-up care.”

Hagan graduated from Southeastern University with degrees in elementary education and psychology and has spent many years working for Florida Baptist Children’s Home and then Heartland for Children, one of the five core partners with the school. The others are nearby Southeastern University, United Way of Central Florida, Central Florida Health Care, all working with Polk County Public Schools on the project.

Crystal Lake was awarded the community school pilot program two years ago, with core partners signing a 25-year memorandum of understanding, promising to provide financial support, medical and social aid, along with academic enhancement for several generations. They are providing after-school tutoring and will have before-school help, along with weekend academic help at the school as they build more partnerships. The tutoring is available outside of regular school hours because all of the students live in the working-class neighborhood around the school.

It is designed to break the cycle of poverty and improve student performance, based on similar programs in Hillsborough and Orange counties.

""No one can do their best in school or at work when they are hungry, sick or in pain,"" said Christina Criser, CEO of United Way of Central Florida. ""The holistic services at the Crystal Lake Community Partnership School addresses needs for students, families, and the community at large.""

Crystal Lake Elementary Principal Kristan Fowler said there is already an impact.

“The discipline (issue) has come down,” Fowler said, noting there are fewer referrals to the office and suspensions. “I start talking about it and I get so emotional — all these opportunities for our children here.”

Fowler has more than two decades of education experience and is in her second year as a principal. She was an assistant principal at Boswell Elementary in Auburndale and has spent time teaching fifth, third and first grades.

It is difficult to nail down an exact program cost, but three positions filled this year, along with contracted services, cost about $420,000, with the George Jenkins Foundation and the Iron Horse Foundation donating through United Way. The Givewell Foundation and Publix charities have also donated funding.

In addition to Hagan, there is a health and wellness coordinator, along with a parents and family engagement coordinator.

The groups and businesses send in volunteers to read with kindergartners and help students plant and tend to a vegetable and flower garden. They also provide food and clothing to the Title I students, most of whom qualify for free or reduced cost lunches. The Girl Scouts are on campus, as is Central Florida Health Care’s Mobile Kitchen to teach families about healthy and nutritious eating. A recent partnership and pizza event saw 250 people show up.

Classes are going to be offered for parents, based on things they have said they want, including financial, job and computer training, along with English language classes because foreign-born families want to assimilate.

Fowler and Hagan said some students are dealing with more than poverty: Some have educational or learning challenges, there are behavior issues, many come from single-parent homes or abusive situations, and some routinely go hungry.

Two fifth-graders who have attended the school for several years have seen a positive change.

“I got suspended for fighting,” said 11-year-old Enrique Hernandez, explaining the punishment straightened out his behavior. “I should not fight because school is not for fighting, it’s for learning. I’ve never been back to the office.”

He was one of four students rewarded for his improved behavior and grades with VIP treatment at a recent Lakeland Magic game.

“Kindness reminds the kids that they’re special, that they can succeed,” Hagan said.

Fowler and Hagan have implemented a positive behavior program based on “houses,” like in Harry Potter books. Their houses are based on character traits and are called Courage, Perseverance, Integrity and Loyalty. They even have their own T-shirts. The house with most points at the end of the school year is getting a trip to Legoland.

Shaelynn Cox, 11, said the positive behavior program has helped her be a better student and classmate.

“I’ve gotten extra recess, ice cream,” Shaelynn said. When asked what the best part of Crystal Lake Elementary is, she said, “Getting to learn — the teachers are nice.”

As Fowler walked down a sidewalk, students darted to her side, arms outstretched for hugs. Fowler says she worries about her students even when she is not at school, adding there is one little boy whom she never sees smile.

“I just want to take him home and rock him and tell him, ‘You’re going to grow up and be somebody important,’” Fowler said. “We just want to see the children thrive.”

339,"Milton High grads Watson, Weekley continue PGA Tour’s amazing storyline","CLOSE WATCH: Bubba Watson reflects on PGA memories Bill Vilona, Special to PNJ

Though five years apart in age, Bubba Watson and Boo Weekley have a commonality in professional golf extending well beyond their country boy first names and growing up in the same community.

They are self-taught players, who rose from frequent rounds at Tanglewood Golf Course, often with Heath Slocum -- the third connection of the Milton High-to-PGA Tour improbable journey -- into winning in golf’s highest, world competitive arena.

Thirteen years after Watson and Weekley first competed together on the PGA Tour, both realize their golf background and longevity is something that may never been seen again.

“You could say places like LA, or Dallas, or other cities with a lot of people, a lot of more affluent people in golf that something like this might happen there,” said Watson, who turned 40 in November, following a 2018 season where he won three PGA Tour events. “But when your talking about East Milton (Boo’s neighborhood) and Bagdad (Bubba’s home), it’s going to be very hard to beat that.”

So fitting the duo finished 30 minutes apart last Friday on the 18th hole at the Tournament Players Club-Louisiana, following a rain-delayed first round of the Zurich Classic in New Orleans. A round that started 20-plus hours earlier for both players.

But here they were, two players from the same high school, who played the same Pensacola area public courses, together among a field from the world on the PGA Tour last week in New Orleans.

“It’s what the Good Lord planned for us,” said Weekley, 45, whose spirits have been tested the past two years with elbow surgery and removal of a cancerous cyst from his shoulder. “(God) had a plan for all of us, Heath included. It was a matter of how we handle it and how we do it.

“I didn’t believe I was a golfer growing up. I was a hunter and fisherman and I was going to do something else. Bubba knew he was going to be a golfer. Heath knew he was going to be a golfer. So they kinda both inspired me to be a little better than I was.”

Weekley and Slocum, 45, who lives in Alpharetta, Ga., and last played a full PGA Tour schedule in 2015, were on the same Milton Panthers boys golf team coached by now-athletic director Murry Rutledge.

Watson was 12 years old when both were Milton High seniors.

“They were my idols growing up,” said Watson, now co-owner of the Pensacola Blue Wahoos and with a PGA Tour career of 12 wins, including two Masters Tournament victories that quality him for World Golf Hall of Fame consideration.

He reflected on the path last Friday at the Zurich Classic which included two busloads of 75 Blue Wahoos’ season-ticket holders, sponsors and front office stay traveling to see him.

“I was young, watching them, learning from them and seeing how they were doing it,” said Watson, who teamed with J.B. Holmes to make the cut and finished tied for 34th. “I wanted to be like them. I wanted to play on (Milton) team, then continue on in golf and hopefully be a pro.

“And now, when you look and see that all three of us have won at least three times on (PGA) Tour and we all played in the 2008 Masters… and we lived in Milton (Slocum), East Milton and Bagdad…. you add all that up, it’s pretty remarkable.”

As Watson said, it’s something that might be possible in a major city, but likely from the same private club. That’s not the case with this group.

Boo and Bubba both learned the game from their fathers, but neither went off to private golf academies or traveled across the globe to play in junior golf tournaments. Slocum’s father, Jack, was a PGA of America teaching pro and former mini-tour player.

“For me, all of a sudden, it just kinda clicked,” said Weekley, who played with friend Colt Knost at the Zurich Classic, but the duo didn’t make the cut. “And I got the right breaks at the right time. I have been healthy enough to stay out there and play the game.”

After Weekley missed all last season to recover from the tendinitis and cancer surgery, he has limited playing status on the PGA Tour, but is fully exempt on the tour-sanctioned, Web.com Tour.

He finished tied for 25th two weeks ago at the Heritage Classic in Hilton Head, S.C., an event Weekley won two of this three PGA Tour events. He’s planning to play as much golf as his body allows. His oldest son, Parker, is now 17 and “taller than I am,” Weekley said, and a junior at Milton.

“I’m still trying to get my mind wrapped around the actual grind again,” Weekley said. “We’re still knocking off the cobwebs to a certain degree. I get out there practicing, and I say, ‘Man, why am I doing this?’ My body is not feeling as good.

“It is hard to get myself motivated sometimes. Some days, it’s like going through the motions like slinging a hammer. It’s just bam, bam… it gets old after awhile.

“Being able to come back here (on PGA Tour), I wasn’t sure. But at least I knew I would go out and try it one more time on the Web.com. I haven’t played well (on Web), but I have out here (PGA Tour). I feel I can compete out there.

“I’m going to try and do it as long as I can do it.”

For both Weekley and Watson, it’s been a journey that has defied odds.

342,"Former UM, FIU professor sentenced to 6 1/2 years for possessing child porn","MIAMI - A Miami man, who was a former adjunct professor at the University of Miami and Florida International University, was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for maintaining two storage units that contained more than 5,000 images of child pornography, Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, announced Tuesday in a news release.

Adolfo Zayas-Bazan Albaisa, 56, pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography in February.

He was sentenced Monday to a total of 78 months in prison. U.S. District Judge Federico A. Moreno also ordered Albaisa to serve 20 years of supervised release following his prison sentence.

According to the news release, Albaisa earned a master's degree in architecture from Harvard University and taught as an adjunct professor at the University of Miami from 1994 to 2002, and at Florida International University from 2000 to 2002.

Prosecutors said he maintained control of the storage units in Miami and Doral from 2007 to 2016.

Authorities said he stopped making payments on the units and they were auctioned off to the highest bidder in 2013 and 2016.

According to the news release, each auction winner discovered pictures of underage boys engaged in sexual activity in the storage units.

The FBI later confirmed that Albaisa's fingerprints were found on two of the pictures.

In addition to the child porn images, other items, such as Boy Scout paraphernalia, children's clothing and photographs of teenagers taken at swimming meets and wrestling matches were found in the units, the news release stated.

Prosecutors said Albaisa also kept personal items in the storage units, such as ""architectural drawings and magazines, his library card to the University of Miami library, family photographs, his resume, and various articles of mail addressed to his home.""

357,Live like Darian: What if one teen's simple acts of kindness could change the world?,"Darian Locklear will be remembered as many things: bright, warm, kind, athletic and beautiful. But she was shy, too. Or as her mother phrased it with a laugh, “just a little socially awkward.” Even as a teenager, Darian was uncomfortable doing things like ordering at a restaurant.

And that’s why, following Darian’s death -- the 16-year-old from Metro Detroit was killed in a car crash on Feb. 6, 2018, en route to hockey practice with a friend -- Darian’s mother, Regina Locklear, was more than a little surprised when other teenagers started coming forward, contacting her with stories and fond memories to share about their beloved confidant and classmate.

The stories

The first girl who got in touch with Regina wanted to share an emotional experience about a particularly vulnerable time in her life: Years ago, the girl said, she had been ousted by her inner circle in middle school. She went from a large group of friends to no friends, and the only person who would talk to her, was Darian.

Regina was incredibly touched. She had no idea.

When Regina posted some of these details on her Facebook page -- with the girl’s blessing, of course -- a similar story surfaced, this time, via text message.

Regina received a message from a man she used to work with about 25 years ago, saying his daughter goes to the same high school that Darian attended, and apparently, the two girls knew one another.

About two weeks before Darian died, as the story goes, the man found a suicide note in his daughter’s bedroom. The family knew the teen was being bullied, but they didn’t know it was happening to such a serious extent. When they called a family meeting to talk about it, the girl confirmed that yes: “things had gotten bad enough to where she didn’t want to be here anymore,” as Regina said.

But one of the reasons the teen survived this tumultuous period, was thanks to Darian, the girl’s dad said to Regina.

“The girls didn’t even hang out outside of (school),” Regina said. “(But Darian) took her in and helped her. She coached and kind of mentored her through it. Darian never mentioned any of this.”

And then in another chance encounter, another former co-worker of Regina’s started chatting with the boy behind the counter at a local pizza restaurant, when it came up -- in a rather roundabout way -- that they were both familiar with the Locklear family.

When Darian’s name was mentioned, the boy lit up, recalling how when he was in the fourth or fifth grade, he’d sometimes sit at a lunch table by himself. But whenever that would happen, he said, Darian would get all her friends to come over, and they’d join him.

Fast-forward to today, the same young man now attends church regularly with the Locklears, after Regina came up to the pizza shop to meet him. He was even baptized this past February, and he’d never been a regular churchgoer before.

There was another teen who told Regina she had been sexually assaulted by a boy from school, and when she came forward, no one believed her, not even her friends. Darian was the only person at school who would talk to her, and she was forever grateful for that compassion. Darian’s kindness had gotten her through a very dark time.

The stories like these are plentiful.

Darian didn’t become best friends with everyone she encountered, but she was kind -- every day. She listened to people. And she touched people, in ways that her family might have never known about otherwise.

A mother's love, a mother's faith

To talk to Regina is to talk to a survivor. Although she says the family is doing OK these days, you can sometimes hear the grief in her voice, like a bumpy road she’s still trying to figure out how to navigate.

It’s more than understandable.

After all, it’s only been a little more than a year that she’s had to learn how to live without her only daughter.

“I mean, we’re able get out of bed every day,” Regina said. “We’re at peace. Peace is an OK work to use. We have our moments and our days when it’s difficult. But we have that outlook where you have to pick yourself up and keep going.”

Regina wrote about her experience, of opening her door and standing face to face with two state troopers, as they delivered the news that Darian had passed.

“It was 10 o’clock at night, and they asked if they could come in,” Regina wrote. “They then asked if Darian Locklear was our daughter. The last thing I recall them saying was, ‘She was in an accident, and I’m sorry, but she didn’t make it.’ I literally crumbled to the floor screaming, ‘NO!’ And then I just remember screaming, ‘Oh my God, what do I do? I don’t know what to do.’ Over and over and over again. My head was spinning. This could not be happening. To us. To HER … But it was. In the days to come, we would plan the funeral and bury our youngest child, our precious daughter, Darian. … We stumbled around like zombies for months. I don’t know how I got out of bed in the days following the accident. I wasn’t sure how I would go on without her. It was my worst nightmare -- the thing I prayed about every night. ‘God, please keep my kids safe and healthy.’”

In the wake of the accident, in trying to make sense of everything -- how this could have happened, the grief, how the family would move on -- the Locklears leaned on their faith. As Regina put it, she and her husband had always been believers, but life kind of got in the way, as it does sometimes.

“Darian played hockey, my son played hockey, we both worked and we were unbelievably busy,” Regina said. “We barely had time for dinner together.”

But in their time of need, the day after the accident, Regina’s sister-in-law, who’s very strong in her faith, came over to the Locklear home, accompanied by the pastors from her church.

Regina recalls sitting with everyone on the family’s living room floor when she became fixated on one thing in particular.

“My biggest concern, or worry, other than, ‘How am I going to survive this?’ is, I wanted to know (Darian’s) soul was in heaven,” Regina said.

Photo used with permission from Regina Locklear

The group talked it over, about how Darian had attended Spring Hill, a Christian camp in Northern Michigan, when she was 11 or 12, and how she’d been exposed to a Christian upbringing, even if the family didn't attend church regularly.

“It was easy to convince me, or all of us, that she was in a good place, and that she was with Jesus,” Regina said. “That perspective really made me want to be closer to God and Jesus, because then I’d be closer to her.”

People had been sending books to the family about losing a child, or how to cope with unimaginable grief. Regina said she probably read 15 of them in about two months. She was desperate for answers, and she needed to know why. Why did this happen?

So the family started attending church every week. At one point, their group swelled to about 20 to 25 people, and it felt good, she said.

“Every weekend, there’d be a connection and something we could relate to,” Regina said. “We left feeling uplifted. I don’t know how we survived those first few months. It’s a big blur.”

Regina returned to her job after only two weeks, and said she walked around like a zombie for probably four to six months. She had to give a big presentation about a month after Darian’s death, and apparently, it went really well, according to her former co-workers.

“I don’t even remember it,” Regina said. “I’m not superhuman or an ice princess. I just have to believe that it’s God giving me, and us, the strength.”

The bracelets

As time went on, Regina and other loved ones decided to do “a modest little thing” to honor Darian and keep her memory alive, as Regina put it.

Those quiet acts of kindness from Darian really seemed to resonate with people.

So the group had rubber bracelets made, with one side reading, “Kindness is beautiful” and the other side displaying the words “Fly high, Darian.”

Regina said she, along with others, handed the bracelets out to Darian’s friends at first, and they were tasked with giving out a bracelet to anyone caught performing a kind act, along with an extra one, to help spread the positive message.

Within hours, the teens had distributed all the bracelets, and they started posting photos to social media. From there, the concept took off. Regina’s first order of 300 bracelets was gone in a matter of days.

They’ve since been mailed across the country, to states including Colorado, Oregon, New York, South Carolina, Texas and Arizona. People really do want to live like Darian.

It’s often teachers and principals who’ve read Darian's story online or who have seen the social media posts, who want the bracelets for their own communities.

Maybe the group was on to something.

A community to lean on

Regina’s former company, Cooper Standard Automotive, wanted to do something special following Darian’s death, so it organized the construction of a playground in her honor, which was built at a shelter for women and children who have lived through domestic violence.

A fundraising account attached to the funeral website raised about $40,000, and the company matched that number. About 35 people -- some family and friends, and some employees -- built the playground in a single day, braving “every kind of weather you could imagine.” It was therapeutic, in a way.

From there, Darian’s loved ones continued full speed ahead, keeping busy with various fundraisers to promote her message of kindness.

At one 5K event, “Darian’s Kindness Warriors” gathered more than 100 participants and raised more than $14,000 in a matter of weeks.

Now, in fact, this coming weekend, there’s Dash for Darian -- a 5K for Kindness, which will raise money for the Darian Locklear Kindness Scholarship.

And that’s not to mention a three-on-three hockey tournament, a Skate for Darian event and several other good causes. The funds raised go toward the aforementioned kindness scholarship, which will soon be awarded to one or two students who’ve proven that they “live kindness” every day.

There’s another scholarship as well, intended for girls in Michigan who want to play hockey but struggle to afford the expensive sport. This year, five girls received about $13,000 to put toward expenses.

Darian played hockey starting at the age of 7, first with the boys, then with the girls in an AAA league. She went on to win three state championships and even a national championship.

The kindness talks

As for Regina, these days, she’s still adjusting to her “new normal.” It helps to stay busy with “kindness talks,” as they’re called. They started last spring because of a fourth-grade teacher who told her students all about Darian, and the children were enthralled by her, as Regina said. They all wrote essays about what it means to be kind, the teacher recorded them, and then at the end, they all yelled, “Fly high, Darian!”

The teacher reached out to Regina and explained how much it would mean to the kids if she paid the classroom a visit.

So she went. The students wanted to know all about her daughter -- all her favorites, and they wanted to hear exactly what she was like.

This school year, Regina is back at it, spreading Darian’s kindness, and explaining to the children how little daily acts can add up to make a big difference.

Online: The Darian Locklear Project

“I try to be interactive with the kids, and get them to talk about times when they’ve been kind,” Regina said. “It’s evolved now. I have a kindness quiz. It gets them to talk. We say like, ‘Have any of you ever been bullied? Have you witnessed it? Have you stepped in?’ They’re so into it. A handful of kids already had their Darian bracelets. They were bragging about how they got them.”

Darian's memory

Like most parents, Regina loves to talk about her kids. You can tell they're the light of her life. She has a son, too, who’s now in his second year of college, studying at the University of Michigan. Trever is 20. Darian would have been a high school senior this year. You can tell how proud Regina is, of both of her kids.

Some people don’t know how to broach the subject of Darian’s passing, Regina said, adding that sometimes, it can be awkward or “weird” when it’s clearly the elephant in the room, but no one should be scared to bring her up. It’s not as if Regina will somehow forget, and you’ll be the one to remind her.

She loves sharing stories about her sweet girl.

And speaking of stories, Regina has one more, or at least, that’s what she promised during this interview, with a laugh. It's a good one.

“When my son was a senior in high school, we still weren’t (attending church regularly),” Regina said, diving in. “But I wanted my kids to get baptized, and my son said, ‘Why would I get baptized? I don’t even know if I believe in God.’”

Regina and her husband were dumbfounded. They didn't know he felt that way.

“He came to church willingly,” Regina said. “He didn’t say much, but apparently, he wasn’t buying into it. We were devastated, like, ‘What do you mean, you don’t believe?’”

Trever was 17 years old at the time.

As Regina tells it, they eventually moved on. Life went on.

But then came the week of Darian’s funeral, and leading up to the service, the Locklears were trying to pick a song to play. They were struggling to come up with one.

Eventually, Trever found something online: “Believe,” by Brooks & Dunn. He showed it to his mom, who hadn’t forgotten their previous serious conversation about faith.

Regina listened to the lyrics carefully, and finally asked, “Does this mean you believe?” It seemed that that's perhaps what Trever was implying, but she didn't want to assume.

But the song clearly had an impact on him, and Regina could see that.

“He turned up and his eyes were full of tears,” she said. “And he said, ‘Mom, I just have to believe I’m going to see her again.’”

A wave of relief washed over Regina’s body.

“(Now) he’s a super strong believer. It was a 100% turnaround, all because he wants to see his sister again. Whatever the motivation is, that’s OK. He does believe that his sister died to save his soul, and a lot of other souls. A lot of people have come to (their faith) that never would have, ever, if this hadn’t have happened. She is an angel for so many people.”

The story of a girl

Everyone should have five minutes to chat with Regina. In her, you might hear your own mom, a friend or an aunt. You might hear yourself. It doesn’t take long to figure out where Darian must have learned how to be so kind and warm.

Regina spoke about how others have had to deal with unimaginable losses too, and she knows her family isn’t alone. They're not the only ones who've had to navigate unbelievable grief. Even in the accident, Darian wasn’t the only one in the car that day. Julianna Ward-Brown, a fellow high school junior, was also killed. She’s survived by just as many loved ones.

But for today, this is Darian’s story: about how the kindness of one girl has the potential to spread worldwide. About one family, saved by their faith.

The kindness message is simple, but it resonates with people.

“This was not something I would have ever expected from her,” Regina said. “We never knew she was that person who’d be there for all those girls.

“Yes, our lives are 100% different from what they were before. We are not the same people. (Darian’s passing) was life-changing. Of course, I’d choose to have my daughter back 100,000%, but at least there’s some good that’s come out of it.”

359,Twin baby golden-headed lion tamarins welcomed at Gulf Breeze Zoo,"CLOSE Learn more about these golden-headed lion tamarin twins, named Derwin and Dahlia, who were born at Gulf Breeze Zoo to parents Hector and Dorothy. Jake Newby, Wochit

The Gulf Breeze Zoo welcomed two new furry little members to its family last month when a boy/girl set of twin golden-headed lion tamarins was born.

Now this week, Derwin and Dahlia are enjoying their general public debut, hanging out with their parents and exploring their tamarin exhibit stomping grounds of the zoo.

""They're explorers, they're constantly on and off their parents' backs,"" said Gulf Breeze Zoo Executive Director Bill Baker of the rare primates, who were born on March 18. ""And they're constantly playing, climbing and generally exploring everything in sight.""

Golden-headed lion tamarins, named for their distinguished golden manes, are endemic to Brazil. They are indigenous specifically to the State of Bahia, located in the northeastern part of the Atlantic coast.

The tiny tamarins have tails typically in the 12-15 inch length range, which is considerably longer than their 8-13-inch tall bodies. Even at their maximum weight, the species rarely exceed two pounds.

Like their monkey relatives, the tamarins are an arboreal species, meaning they spend a good chunk of their lives hanging out and sleeping in trees. The forest is their primary habitat.

""They are listed on the ICUN red list as an endangered species with a current population in the wild of about 1,000,"" Baker said. ""That figure is stable at the moment.""

Derwin and Dahlia are kin of Hector and Dorothy. Hector has been with Gulf Breeze Zoo since 2007 and Dorothy since 2010. Baker said the twins can be very attached to their parents but in the case of baby tamarins in general, it takes a village to raise them.

""The kids tend to be raised by the parents but there's also a lot of alloparenting coming into this, where other members of the group will raise them as well,"" Baker said.

The babies have six brothers and sisters, according to Baker, as they are the third set of twins birthed by Dorothy.

Staff at the zoo couldn't be more giddy to welcome babies of another endangered species into their confines. In early 2018, Katana the baby white rhinoceros became the first southern white rhino born at Gulf Breeze Zoo in its 34-year history.

""We are very excited, we've had a lot of victories, a lot of wonderful things happen this year,"" Baker said. ""Of course we had our family of orangutans come back from the Connecticut Zoological Conservation Center from LEO. Then, of course, there was Katana, as well. It's wonderful to have that group back. So, we've had a lot of really significant advances in conservation and advances in our collection.""

Guests can get a glimpse of the twin babies at the zoo on 5701 Gulf Breeze Parkway at the tamarin exhibit. The zoo is open seven days a week, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

RICHMOND, Va. - A Virginia boy battling a debilitating disease got to live out his dream Sunday.

Smiling from ear to ear, Matthew Martinez was sworn in as a member of the Richmond Police Department over the weekend.

""He really did walk out of the room as Matthew a kid and came back in as Officer Martinez of the SWAT team,"" Michael Martinez, Matthew's father, said.

Matthew's wish came true Saturday as Make-A-Wish Greater Virginia revealed they were going to make him part of the SWAT team.

Make-A-Wish Greater Virginia President Sheri Lambert said granting Matthew's wish is all about bringing the family hope.

""You’re never alone. That’s something that the SWAT team preaches every single day, and I wanted him to feel that he would never be alone for any challenges that I know he’s gonna face,"" Richmond Police Department Interim Chief William Smith said.

Matthew has cystic fibrosis, the same disease that took his brother’s life on Christmas Day.

""As a two-time recipient of a wish with Michael and now with Matthew, we’re grateful,"" Michael Martinez said. ""The program itself is wonderful, for children that likely wouldn’t have these opportunities.""

Lambert said the happiness is contagious.

""To see his joy and excitement and just the perfect smile that was brought about through his wish experience, it's just so inspiring,"" Lambert said. ""It makes me want to work even harder and for us to do whatever it takes to achieve our vision of granting ever eligible child’s wish.""",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/04/29/virginia-boy-joins-swat-team-as-part-of-make-a-wish-opportunity/,2019-04-29T19:06:23Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394

PALM COAST, Fla. - Carmen Gray isn’t mourning alone after the death of her 18-year-old son Curtis.

On April 13, Curtis Gray was shot and killed near a laundromat in Palm Coast.

The boy accused of the shooting, 17-year-old Marion Gavins, turned himself in days later.

But Sunday was about how to move forward.

“I celebrate my son’s life,” Carmen Gray said. “He lived with us for 18 years and as you can see, he lived a full life.”

After her son’s death, Gray said she wanted his memorial to serve as a link to help others, one that would offer outlets for people to grieve and know what resources are available and how to access them.

For her, this wasn’t an effort she could accomplish on her own.

“Huge statement to the community and the community surrounding Flagler County,” Gray said. “We wanted to showcase that a community could come together even in the midst of tragedy.”

Gray admits that while on the outside she appears calm, little chips break off as she remembers her son, a high school senior and athlete who was counting down the days to graduation.

Gray said her mission now is to help others cope with the grief and trauma.

“I hope that with people, every step there will be commitment to be there for each other,” she said. “Strengthening our commitment and stand against violence.”

364,Five men trapped in cave in Virginia - Story,"FOX NEWS - Months before his body was found buried in a shallow grave, a 5-year-old Illinois boy had disclosed information about possible abuse to a doctor — but his alarming words weren’t enough to place him in protective custody, records showed. Andrew “AJ” Freund, who was found dead on Wednesday a few miles from his house in Woodstock, was at the doctor’s office with a large bruise on his right hip on Dec. 18, 2018, the Chicago Tribune reported. Freund and his mother said the family dog jumped on the boy, causing the injury, but the doctor was still suspicious. “Maybe someone hit me with a belt. Maybe Mommy didn’t mean to hurt me,” Freund then told the doctor, according to records released Friday. Department of Children and Family Services, which was investigating the Dec. 18, 2018, complaint, said the doctor could not determine how the boy got the large bruise. The case was eventually closed a month later because there wasn’t enough evidence to keep Freund in protective custody after his mother, JoAnn Cunningham, was arrested for driving on a suspended license. Freund’s body was found about 7 miles from his home on Wednesday after authorities launched a search for the 5-year-old when his father, Andrew Freund Sr., called 911 to report his son was missing on April 18. Cunningham, 36, and Freund, 60, allegedly beat and forced the child to stand in a cold shower for a long period of time, killing him three days before he was reported missing. His cause of death was ruled as ""craniocerebral trauma as a consequence of multiple blunt force injuries."" Records released by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services on Friday showed the agency received several complaints about the couple now charged in the boy’s murder. AJ Freund was removed from his mother’s care in Oct. 16, 2013, two days after he was born, after Cunningham and the then-infant tested positive for opiates and benzodiazepines. The child was returned to Cunningham in June 2015 and a Youth Service Bureau worker continued to visit their home several times until April 2016 and found no signs of abuse or neglect. The agency then received at least three hotline calls alleging abuse or neglect at the Cunningham and Freund household a year before AJ Freund’s death, records showed. Crystal Lake police officers were also repeatedly called to the Freund family home where they witnessed horrid living conditions, including broken windows, evidence of drug use and the overpowering smell of dog feces.

Over the past 20 years, the Tallahassee Tennis Challenger has built a reputation for attracting talented players from across the globe to its clay courts.

On the same level of excellence, the famed tournament is also known for its quality group of volunteers. These individuals provide top-rate service throughout the week as the unsung stars of the event.

Perhaps the most notable bunch are the ball boys and girls.

While fans watch the singles or doubles competition for entertainment, the ball boys and girls are observing the action to ensure the fluidity of the match.

As quickly as a serve or return sails out of bounds, the children are on spot to retrieve the ball.

The Dennis twins and Garcia volunteered as ball girls/boy. (Photo: Rory Sharrock/Democrat)

This coveted position features a host of returners as well as first-timers serving in this role.

Officials confirmed an estimated 70 kids listed on the roster. They come to Forestmeadows Tennis Complex on differing days and times based on their availability.

Prior to joining the crew, potential ball boys and girls must attend two 90-minute practices. These sessions feature simulated matches with balls hit at top speeds.

Quickness and alertness are the critical elements required to be chosen for the position. They learn to swiftly collect loose balls and the discipline of tennis etiquette.

""Everything is with urgency,"" said Elizabeth Adkison Seay, USTA volunteer who oversees the ball boys and girls at the Tallahassee Tennis Challenger.

""I told one boy to move like your house is on fire. Everything must be really quick. It's very disciplined. You have to be still. You have to keep your hands back while they're playing, or you'll be called out by the chair umpire.""

The ages for ball boys and girls range from 10-18 years old.

A typical weekday for begins after 2 p.m. when school ends. Children report for duty throughout the afternoon and evening. Some have stayed at the facility until 10 p.m.

While on site, the children are assigned to specific courts.

There's also a customized rest area where they use their laptops and cellphones. They can finish homework and eat their meals. Lunch and dinner were provided from the food cart and parents who donated pizzas.

Working as a ball boy/girl is beneficial beyond tennis. Students can use time toward any school-required volunteer hours.

However, the commitment to service centers around a love for all things tennis and the appeal of the city's premier tournament.

""I love being close to the players and running to get all the balls. Being out here makes me feel happy and excited,"" said third-year ball boy Gabe Garcia, a home-schooled sixth grader who competes on the tennis team at Community Christian School (CCS).

Working as a ball boy or girl provides a sense of responsibility and confidence. It also gives them a firsthand look at the behind-the-scenes structure of a tennis tournament.

""It's a really great experience. You get to be out here with the players. At first, you feel a bit timid, but then the more you work, the more comfortable you feel on the court. Then, the better you feel about your performance,"" said Chloe Dennis, fifth-year ball girl and freshman at Lincoln High School.

Although there are no daily financial rewards, the boy and girl who volunteered the most hours receives a check for $100 at the conclusion of the tournament.

This creates a competitive atmosphere for kids seeking to be in attendance on a regular basis.

These ""ball kid moms"" are equally passionate about the service as the kids. They enjoy the great tennis and sharing a common love for the sport with the youths.

""We're honored to be here. It's a great experience. We continue to have wonderful children come out every year,"" Neustadter said.

A Florida woman who was arrested for her 2-year-old son's beating death claimed her ghost has been comforting her while her boyfriend remains behind bars, WFTV reported.

Victoria Toth and her boyfriend, Johnathan Pursglove, 26, of Orlando, were charged with aggravated manslaughter in the 2018 death of Toth's son, Jayce Martin.

The boy reportedly suffered a ""sucker punch"" that was hard enough to drive his spine through his intestines, the news station reported, citing a medical examiner. He was also malnourished and could have been saved had he seen a doctor, the report states.

Toth has since been released from jail and the couple has been staying in contact as she awaits trial, despite being ordered not to. Toth got away with visiting Pursglove in jail due to a clerical error, according to the news station.

The report sheds light on the couple's conversations during those visits, which mostly focused on Jayce.

""I talk to Jayce and he tells me that this is something that we are supposed to go through,"" Toth said. ""Hearing Jayce tell me that we're going to get through it gives me something to hold onto.""

The couple also spoke with Pursglove's mother about the possibility of his car being impounded.

""He goes and sits down at his desk, looks something up on the computer, probably at what your charges were or some kind of crap and goes 'we can't do anything,'"" Pursglove's mother said, according to jailhouse records.

Phone calls revealed Toth once believed her son's ghost was following her around and playing pranks.

379,Daytona Beach Shores woman recalls childhood escape from Nazi Germany,"Beatrice Deutsch and her sister begged their mother to awaken them in time to see the Statue of Liberty as their ship entered New York Harbor.

But it was dark as they approached the port in the early hours of that March 1939 morning, and Bea’s mother let the girls sleep.

“(I wanted to see it) for the whole rest of my life,” said Bea, 85, of Daytona Beach Shores. “I’ve seen the Statue of Liberty from different places in New York, but I never saw it as an immigrant coming in.”

Bea and her family were Jewish refugees from Cronheim, Germany, a small Bavarian town about 100 miles northwest of Munich.

Her father, a Jewish spiritual leader, provided rabbinical services and slaughtered chickens and cattle for the Orthodox community’s kosher consumption.

Bea was born in her parents’ synagogue-attached apartment in 1933, the year Adolf Hitler came to power.

“There were lots of people in Germany that didn't think (Nazi ideology) was going anywhere. They thought Hitler was just a nut,” said Bea, whose surname is now Schemer. But her father wasn’t one of them. “He knew that he needed to take his family off of the European continent.”

Bea’s family sought asylum in South America in 1937, and gained entrance to the U.S. two years later. But before they left Germany, Bea got a taste of the roiling hatred that later would turn into full-fledged genocide.

“We all read about the history of the Holocaust and all of that, but individual experiences like (my family’s) need to be told,” Bea said.

She was only 2 in 1935 when Nazi Germany’s Nuremberg Laws institutionalized anti-Semitism, but she recalls the aftermath clearly.

As a toddler, she watched bright orange flames devour a neighbor’s home from the upstairs window of her family’s apartment. Firefighters blew trumpets in the street below, but they weren’t raising an alarm — they were celebrating.

“They were dancing in front of this burning house, not making any effort whatsoever to put it out,” Bea said. “Because the house was the house of Jews.”

Cronheim was known for the harmonious relationships between Jews, Catholics and Lutherans. But the Nuremberg Laws drove a wedge between Jews and their fellow citizens.

Vandals shattered three of the synagogue’s ground-to-ceiling stained glass windows while Bea’s family was home on the Sabbath.

Other threats were more direct.

“My sister and I would be outside playing and we would get attacked by the neighborhood boys,” Bea said.

One boy hurled a rock that struck her sister in the temple. “She bore a scar of that for the rest of her life.”

The Nazis targeted Jewish traditions — kosher meat was outlawed, and Jews could no longer conduct business with non-Jewish Germans.

But not everyone complied with the Nazi agenda.

A local farmer’s wife risked arrest to hide butter, milk and eggs under the stairs outside Bea’s home in the middle of the night so that her family would have something to eat.

In 1936, the Nazis notified Bea’s father that deportation was imminent.

Her mother’s German heritage dated back to the 1700s, but her father’s family had emigrated from Hungary when he was a child. The Nazis intended to send him back.

He immediately began applying for asylum and eventually was granted passage to Cali, Colombia.

In the event that he was deported before his family could set sail from Germany, he planned for Bea, her mother and sister to go live with Bea’s maternal grandparents in Amsterdam.

“I wouldn't be sitting here telling this story if we had wound up going with them,” Bea said. The Nazis invaded the Netherlands in 1940, and her mother’s relatives there were all sent to Sobibor death camp in Poland and exterminated.

Bea’s family boarded a ship from Hamburg to Colombia in April 1937. When they reached their cabin, they found the contents of their suitcases scattered across the floor. Two Nazi soldiers sifted through their belongings.

Jews weren’t allowed to take any valuables out of Germany, so Bea’s mother had sewn their family jewelry into the lining of her clothes.

“You could imagine how terrified she had to have been that they might find that,” Bea said. But they didn’t, and the soldiers left empty-handed.

Her father brought along his 177-volume rabbinical library to prevent Nazis from burning them.

About 50 Jews lived in Cali when Bea’s family arrived. Her father organized a synagogue, and by the time they left for New York two years later, the community had grown to about 300 Jewish refugees.

Bea’s family stayed in New York for six months, and then moved south to Jacksonville, where her mother’s brother taught in a local synagogue.

The war and the plight of their European relatives were ever-present worries.

They received letters from loved ones back home, but Nazis monitored and redacted the mail so details were scant.

News of Germany’s defeat came on Bea’s 12th birthday — May 7, 1945. But anti-Semitism didn’t just disappear.

Children yelled epithets at Bea and her sister, who was two years older, when they went outside to play. Her parents covered their windows during Jewish festival celebrations so the neighbors couldn’t see them lighting religious candles.

As a young adult, Bea was hired for a bank job — and then the manager began questioning her heritage.

“He said to me, ‘I’m sorry, but this bank does not hire Jews,” she recalled.

Despite those setbacks, Bea is a “very patriotic, proud American,” she said. “These are small incidents that occurred, but for the most part the United States of America saved my life.”

Bea has two daughters, and passed down to them the jewelry her mother smuggled from Germany. She also has one grandson.

She donated her late father’s rabbinical library to the University of Florida. The tomes are housed in the Rare Book Room of the Smathers Library Judaica Suite.

And in 2004, she finally captured the experience that eluded her as a young girl.

She went to New York City and took a boat tour to Liberty Island.

“I stood there and saw the Statue of Liberty as if I were coming in as an immigrant,” Bea said. “I will always remember how important that was to me.""

'Never forget'

The Holocaust survivors’ rallying cry has long been “never forget.”

As the youngest survivors age into their 70s, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., makes a special effort to preserve firsthand accounts in order to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike.

To honor this week's Days of Remembrance, established by Congress as the nation’s annual Holocaust commemoration, The News-Journal is sharing the individual accounts of four local Holocaust survivors.

Aimee Rubensteen, the museum's acquisitions coordinator, travels South Florida “rescuing the evidence of the Holocaust by speaking to firsthand witnesses,” she said, and collecting their World War II-era photos, letters, newspaper clippings, clothing and other artifacts of historical value.

“These original artifacts will be the things that teach the Holocaust to future generations,” Rubensteen said.

The museum’s mission is to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike and to encourage critical thinking about how and why those atrocities occurred.

Firsthand stories make those larger themes more personal.

“A lot of people don’t know about these specific, individual stories. The more we spread the word and expand the conversation, the better it is for everyone,” Rubensteen said.

Individuals or families who are interested in sharing their Holocaust artifacts or family keepsakes with the museum may contact Rubensteen at 786-496-2788 or arubensteen@ushmm.org to schedule an appointment.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190502/daytona-beach-shores-woman-recalls-childhood-escape-from-nazi-germany?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T07:13:16Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
382,Father of 3 killed in road rage case; was it stand your ground or murder?,"Father of 3 killed in road rage case; was it stand your ground or murder? Video

PARRISH, Fla. (WFLA) - Was it a case of your stand ground where a driver claims his life was threatened? Or a case of road rage that led to murder?

That's what Manatee County sheriff's detectives are trying to determine regarding the death of Zachary Barnett, a father of three shot and killed over Easter weekend.

The shooting took place in a rural area near Buckeye Road and U.S. 301 in Manatee County. The sheriff's office says Barnett and another driver came close to colliding that Saturday afternoon around 5:15 p.m.

According to investigators, Barnett swerved, causing the other driver to nearly run off the road.

That's when the driver did a U-turn to allegedly get the license plate from Barnett.

Both men were armed, and when they came to a stop and began arguing, the other driver claims he feared for his life, so he fired his weapon, killing the 32-year-old dad.

The driver then called 911 to alert deputies.

At first glance, the sheriff's office maintains, this appears to be a case of self-defense. However, detectives also point out this case is far from over. It's only ten days old and evidence is still being collected for processing in the near future.

""It's very unfortuate that someone was killed that night. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family. The situation got out of control,"" said Randy Warren, a spokesman for the sheriff's office.

Meanwhile, Barnett's family is anxious for answers, hoping for more details on what led up to their loved one's death.

""All we want is justice for Zach. That's it. It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair,"" said Terri Wood, a close friend of the family who tells us she's known Barnett since he was a boy.

She says this case has torn their community apart, with family and friends hearbroken over the loss of someone they love dearly.

""We loved him like one of our own. We love his family like one of our own, like they're ours. It's so terrible,"" Wood told WFLA.

Detectives say they have a lot of work to do, as investigators work closely with the State Attorney on gathering details and evidence, piecing together those final moments before the shooting.

For now, the accused shooter remains a free man as the case is under investigation.

""We want the family to know we're working hard on the case, and we want to provide them with more details. But, we have to be thorough and take our time,"" said Warren.

Meanwhile, the family is heartbroken for Barnett's wife and three children, now without a father and about to lose their home.

""A lot of questions, and we want answers. That's all, we just want justice,"" Wood said.

Detectives say it could be several weeks until they get more details.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/manatee-county/father-of-3-killed-in-road-rage-case-was-it-stand-your-ground-or-murder-/1967882293,2019-05-01T11:59:03Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

MARTIN COUNTY — Two Broward County men were arrested Monday after they tried stripping the wheels from a pair of vehicles in a Stuart apartment complex, according to arrest reports.

Rayquan Campbell, 19, of Lauerhill, and Jermain Allen, 27, of North Lauderdale, were each charged with two counts of grand theft, two counts of auto burglary and resisting arrest without violence.

Deputies were alerted about 12:30 a.m. of a red Hyundai SUV suspected in a number of recent wheel and tire thefts in Martin and Palm Beach counties.

Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officers say three-year-old Caleb Napal was on the kayak with an 8-year-old child and two adults identified as Emmanuel Herbert and Esteban Hernandez, when the kayak capsized around 8:30 p.m. on Saturday at Emerson Point Preserve near Terra Cia Bay.

Officers did not specify the relationship of those on board the kayak.

Three people were rescued, but 3-year-old Caleb's body was found several hours later. It was determined that no one on board the kayak was wearing a life jacket.

FWC officials urge anyone who is kayaking to wear a life jacket and say children under the age of 6 must always wear a life jacket.

390,SpaceX's rockets and spacecraft have really cool names. But what do they mean?,"CLOSE SpaceX is the undisputed rock star of the Space Coast's commercial launch boom. Their social media plays a role. Video posted Feb. 19, 2017 Rachael L Thomas, FLORIDA TODAY

Space exploration is serious business. Missions cost tens of millions of dollars and frequently put human lives on the line. That’s probably why rockets and spacecraft tend to have serious-sounding names. Atlas, Saturn, Delta, Soyuz (which means “union” in Russian), and a host of other spacefaring machines have some very authoritative names.

More: Ready for sonic booms? NASA, SpaceX targeting early morning for Falcon 9 launch from Cape

Then there’s SpaceX. On the commercial space scene, SpaceX is the kid who rolls around on a skateboard, always sits in the back of the classroom, and still makes straight A’s. The company makes a point of reminding the world that space is still fun—because we all wanted to be astronauts as kids. And they name their gadgets like enthusiastic eighth graders.

Here’s a rundown of SpaceX’s fancifully-titled inventions:

Falcon rockets

On Dec. 5, 2018, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying a Dragon cargo capsule blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 40 on the company's 16th Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) mission to the International Space Station. (Photo: SpaceX)

Okay, so outwardly this one seems pretty tame. Falcons are majestic birds, after all. But wait, there’s more. “Falcon” comes from the Millennium Falcon of Star Wars fame. Yep, that multi-million-dollar piece of high technology designed to ferry equally pricey gizmos into orbit (and beyond!) is named for a fictional spaceship that “once made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs.”

More: Launch schedule: Upcoming Florida rocket launches and landings

SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk is a known science fiction fan so it’s no surprise the company’s flagship rocket is named for the gold standard of sci-fi spaceships. There’s a whole family of Falcon rockets, including the super heavy-lift Falcon Heavy.

Until recently, the ambitious extra, super-duper, great big launch system that Musk says will be able to carry 100 astronauts to Mars was called the Big Falcon Rocket. But that name has recently changed to simply “Starship.” And that’s pretty Falcon disappointing.

Merlin rocket engines

If you’re thinking of King Arthur’s wizard buddy, you’re a little off. While this one sounds like it’s straight out of a 13-year-old's D&D game, it’s actually named for another bird.

A merlin is a variety of medium-sized falcon. Since the Merlin engine is currently used to power Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, that fits nicely. SpaceX’s other rocket engines have equally avian monikers: Kestrel and Raptor.

The Dragon capsule

With another name that sounds like it was ripped from the pages of a fantasy novel, the Dragon capsule and Dragon 2 conjure images of fire-breathing beasts. According to Musk, though, the name is firmly grounded in reality.

“Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if thought it could work, so I named it after their insult,” he said on Twitter in 2018.

Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 17, 2018

That’s right, the Dragon capsule was named for a Peter, Paul and Mary song about a boy and an imaginary dragon that has long been associated with smoking marijuana. Moreover, it was a very public clap back at SpaceX doubters.

With 15 successful missions under its belt, it’s safe to say the Dragon does, in fact, work.

“Of Course I Still Love You” and “Just Read the Instructions”

If these colorful names have you scratching your head, you’re not alone. SpaceX’s fleet of drone ships are named to honor the science fiction author Ian M. Banks. Specifically, his novel The Player of Games, in which OCISLY and JRtI are sentient spaceships.

The ships have whimsical names but their jobs are important. When SpaceX wants to land a rocket booster stage and the launch trajectory takes it too far over the ocean to land the booster at the landing site on solid ground, the autonomous barges head out to sea to serve as floating landing sites.

Another ship, which will be called “A Shortfall of Gravitas,” is currently under construction. The name is another reference to Banks’ work.

395,'He was such a sweet little boy:' Loved ones mourn child fatally struck by semi,"A memorial has been set up in memory of 10-year-old Kevin Pope, who was fatally struck by a semi while walking home from school.

ORLANDO, Fla. - Family, friends, and classmates are mourning the loss of a 10-year-old boy who died Wednesday after he was struck while riding his bicycle by a semitruck during his ride home from school.

Pope was a fifth-grade student at Wetheree Elementary.

Troopers say Kevin was riding his bike home in a crosswalk when a semitruck hit the boy and kept going. He died a short time later.

His classmates told News 6 he was funny, smart and loved to play basketball.

""In class, he would make us laugh all the time,"" said Pope's classmate, Tayella Anderson. ""He just made my day, really.""

A day after the crash, friends, and loved ones put out flowers and balloons at the intersection of Wetherbee Road and Landstar Boulevard, where Kevin was hit.

""He made me laugh and how he used to ride his bike with me and all that,"" Tayella said.

Tayella said she's now making some changes.

""I don’t want to ride my bike to school because anything can happen,"" she said.

Kevin's mother is devastated. She released the following statement to News 6: “I appreciate all of you for reaching out. There is a GoFundMe page that is being set up. I love my baby and he touched a lot of lives.”

Karla Jones, a family friend, told News 6 Kevin was a fun-loving kid who died way too soon.

""He was such a sweet little boy. He had a smile that would brighten up the room,"" Jones said. ""It’s just so new right now, and we’re just trying to make this all sink in.""

If you have any information that can help authorities track down the driver of the semitruck that troopers say was involved, give authorities a call.

The Parent Teacher Organization set up a GoFundMe account to assist the victim's family. Click here to find out more.

Investigators are still looking for a semi-truck driver who hit and killed a 10-year-old boy on a bike in Orange County.WESH Chopper 2 was over the scene Wednesday shortly after state troopers said the driver hit 10-year-old Kevin Pope and kept going. It happened around 2:30 p.m. at Landstar Boulevard and Wetherbee Road. Although the truck drove away, state troopers are not calling this a hit-and-run crash.Troopers said it's likely Kevin had the crossing symbol and the right of way to go through the crosswalk at Wetherbee Road and Landstar Boulevard when a semitruck turned right onto Landstar, hitting the boy.""It's a little boy that's not here anymore. You know what I'm saying?"" said witness Cornelius Smith.Smith said he and his son witnessed something awful Wednesday afternoon.Smith said he was picking up his son from school and heading to his mother's house when he saw a white semitruck with red lettering run over a child on a bicycle.""My son said, 'Daddy, that truck just ran over the little boy,' and when I looked, I saw the back part of the truck running over the little boy,"" Smith said. ""And I was like, 'Did we just witness a little boy getting hit?'""Officials said the Wetherbee Elementary School student was riding his bike alongside Wetherbee Road.The truck driver drove away, and the boy was rushed to Arnold Palmer Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.Smith and his son turned around and waited for investigators to arrive.He said they watched as first responders tried to save the boy.""Just to see the little boy lifeless there on the ground. When I look at him, it's like I'm looking at my son, you know,"" Smith said.Troopers are quick to caution that the law states drivers must know they hit somebody for a crash to be labeled a hit-and-run.The Florida Highway Patrol wants to speak to the driver of that truck before deciding on charging them with a crime.",https://www.wesh.com/article/10-year-old-fatally-struck-by-semi-in-orange-county/27258967,2019-04-25T17:17:00Z,WESH-TV,Couple,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - A Florida man who went to a junior high school with a loaded gun after his son contacted him to say a teacher pushed him has been sentenced to nearly a year of house arrest.

The Palm Beach Post reports 27-year-old Christopher Freeman pleaded guilty last month as part of a deal with prosecutors to possessing a weapon on school property.

Palm Beach County School District police say Freeman’s son video-called him in tears earlier last month, saying a teacher at Bear Lakes Middle School “slammed him.” Freeman told police he then saw an adult grab the boy before the call ended.

A police officer met with Freeman, who uses a wheelchair, when he arrived at the school. The officer reported seeing what appeared to be a gun sticking out of Freeman’s pants. Police found a loaded AK-47 pistol during a search.",http://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-man-gets-house-arrest-for-bringing-ak-47-to-son-s-school/1915571986,2019-04-11T01:27:25Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

407,Husband will deliver powerful message at We Wish You More event,"Jason and Amy Rosenthal. (Photo: Special to the Democrat)

The Tallahassee area has a rare opportunity to connect with a powerful love story that has touched the world.

Amy Krouse Rosenthal was a remarkable daughter, wife, mother, and children’s book author whose positive spirit and encouragement of others endeared her to all she met. When she was diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer, she found a way to continue encouraging others and to prepare her beloved family for the day she would no longer be physically present with them.

She was intentional about an Instagram project she started after her diagnosis to post at 1:23 each day an encouraging thought. When she realized this was taking too much of her energy she turned to writing a book with her daughter, Paris, setting her on a path in life that she finds meaningful. In her grief, Paris picked up that Instagram project her mother started and completed it with her own particular flair. It was a way for Paris to work through her grief.

A most notable way in which Amy prepared her family was in the permission she granted to her husband to find happiness in his life going forward. Between micro-naps on the couch she wrote an article that was published in the New York Times Modern Love Section on Valentine’s Day 2017, three days before her death.

She didn’t know that her words were so powerful they struck a chord with thousands around the world. Titled, “You May Want to Marry My Husband” it was filled with, as her husband describes, “unbearable sadness, ironic humor and total honesty.”

Jason Rosenthal comes to Tallahassee to share what this generous gift by his wife of encouraging him to live his life has meant to him. He says that her edict to fill his own empty space with a new story has given him permission to make the most out of his remaining time on this planet. And he is doing just that.

He started the Amy Krouse Rosenthal Foundation with two primary goals related to important matters in Amy’s life – literacy and ovarian cancer research. He is speaking in communities like ours about the importance of “talking with your mate, your children, and other loved ones about what you want for them when you are gone. Doing this gives them liberty to live a full life and eventually find meaning again,” says Rosenthal.

Amy Krouse Rosenthal wrote over 30 books in her 51 years. We have 29 of them in our public library so she must have a following here. One of them is titled – ""I Wish You More.""

According to Amy, “more” was her first word spoken. And she used it in her essay that went viral. She wanted more. But when she realized more was not in her future, she prescribed that those she love follow plan “Be” which was about being present in life because time is precious.

Jason will be speaking at the Goodwood Carriage House on Tuesday, April 30, from 6-7:30 p.m. at an event we are calling, We Wish You More. Big Bend Hospice and the Community Advance Care Planning Encouragement Task Force are offering this event for free to honor National Healthcare Decisions Day.

Midtown Reader, accepting cash, checks and cards, will be selling Jason’s recently released book, ""Dear Boy,"" which he will autograph, along with some of Amy’s popular titles. 1.5 CEUs are offered along with light refreshments. The Five Wishes living will document will be available to all. This promises to be an uplifting evening.

408,"Rabbi's hands are shattered in fatal attack on Calif. synagogue, says gun 'miraculously' jammed","- In the minutes after the gunman fled the scene of a shooting that killed a woman inside a Southern California synagogue, a wounded Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein wrapped his bloodied hand in a prayer shawl, stood on a chair and addressed the panicked congregation, vowing to stay strong in the face of the deadly attack targeting his community.

""We are a Jewish nation that will stand tall. We will not let anyone take us down. Terrorism like this will not take us down,"" Goldstein recalled telling his congregants after the gunfire erupted Saturday at Chabad of Poway.

Congregant Lori Kaye, 60, was killed in the shooting, which injured Goldstein, 8-year-old Noya Dahan and her 34-year-old uncle, Almog Peretz, authorities said. Hours after the three wounded were released from hospitals, Goldstein described the onslaught at a news conference Sunday outside the synagogue north of San Diego.

Goldstein said he was preparing for a service on the last day of Passover, a holiday celebrating freedom, and heard a loud sound. He turned around, and a saw a young man wearing sunglasses standing in front of him with a rifle.

""I couldn't see his eyes. I couldn't see his soul,"" Goldstein said. He raised his hands and lost one of his fingers in the shooting.

And then, Goldstein said, ""miraculously the gun jammed.""

The attack Saturday came exactly six months after a mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue.

John T. Earnest, 19, surrendered to police after bursting into the synagogue and opening fire as about 100 people were worshipping inside.

Earnest, who had no previous contact with law enforcement, may face a hate crime charge in addition to homicide charges when he's arraigned later this week, San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said. He was being held without bail, and it was unclear if he had an attorney. Police searched Earnest's house and said he was also being investigated in connection with an arson attack on a mosque in nearby Escondido, California, on March 24.

The 8-year-old victim said she had just finished praying and was getting ready to go play with other children when gunshots rang out. Her uncle rushed her and the other children outside, the girl said.

Her leg was bleeding but doctors told her she didn't need surgery, she said.

""I was scared, really, really scared,"" she said. ""I didn't see my dad. I thought he was dead.""

Her father, 32-year-old Israel Dahan, said he flipped over a folding table as soon as he saw the man enter carrying a long rifle and told people to run. He went to look for his children and found two had been ushered out and his 5-year-old was hiding in the bathroom, he said.

There were indications an AR-type assault weapon might have malfunctioned after the gunman fired numerous rounds inside, Gore said. An off-duty Border Patrol agent fired at the shooter as he fled, missing him but striking his getaway vehicle, the sheriff said.

Shortly after fleeing, Earnest called 911 to report the shooting, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said. When an officer reached him on a roadway, ""the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" he said.

Friends described Kaye as giving, warm and attentive to community members on their birthdays and when they were sick. A wife and mother, she loved gardening and made delicious challah for her family and friends, said Roneet Lev, 55.

Goldstein described her as a pioneering founding member of the congregation and said he was heartbroken by her death. He said the attack could have harmed many more people had the shooter turned toward the sanctuary where so many were praying.

""Lori took the bullet for all of us,"" the rabbi said, his hands wrapped in bandages. ""She didn't deserve to die.""

He said that Kaye's physician husband was called to tend to a wounded worshipper and fainted when he realized it was his wife.

When the gunfire erupted, another worshipper, Shimon Abitbul, said he immediately placed his 2-year-old grandson on the floor and waited for a break in the shooting to grab the boy and sprint away.

Then Abitbul ran back to the shooting scene to try to help a woman he described as having a hole in her chest and who later died, he said Sunday.

Abitbul, who was visiting from Israel and staying with his daughter and her family in Southern California, said he was still coming to grips with the carnage.

""All of us are human beings,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter if you are Jews or Christians or Muslims.""

Peretz, who was wounded in the leg, said he turned around after hearing gunfire and saw the shooter standing by the door. He grabbed his niece by the hand and carried out another child.

He then saw a group of children and got them running, ""I tell them, 'go this way, go this way,"" said Peretz, who is visiting from Israel.

Gore said authorities were reviewing Earnest's social media posts, including what he described as a ""manifesto."" There was no known threat after Earnest was arrested, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship Saturday and again on Sunday as a precaution, police said.

A person identifying himself as John Earnest posted an anti-Jewish screed online about an hour before the attack. The poster described himself as a nursing school student and praised the suspects accused of carrying out deadly attacks on mosques in New Zealand last month that killed 50 and at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, in which 11 people were killed.

""It was a hate crime, no doubt about it,"" national security adviser John Bolton said on ""Fox News Sunday."" He said investigators have not seen any connection between the suspect and other extremist groups.

California State University, San Marcos, confirmed that Earnest was a student who was on the dean's list and said the school was ""dismayed and disheartened"" that he was suspected in ""this despicable act.""""

Goldstein said President Donald Trump called him to share condolences on behalf of the American people.

The White House acknowledged the call. ""The President expressed his love for the Jewish people and the entire community of Poway,"" Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement.

Several dozen people, many wearing black, gathered on a street corner in Poway Sunday to show their support for the victims and congregation and to call for an end to hate and violence.

They carried signs reading ""no more killing"" and ""Shalom."" A young boy sat with a cardboard sign reading ""we must do better"".

Deb Lira, 71, of San Diego, said she was angry and sickened by the attack in what has long been a peaceful community.

""I'm here because I'm Jewish and this is my message,"" she said, pointing to a sign that read ""never again"" and ""never forget.""

""I will not be silent,"" she said.

409,'She's part of my family now:' Pensacola woman donates kidney to former employee,"CLOSE A Pensacola woman donated her kidney to her former employee in January. Here, the two discuss the special bond they've forged over the past nine years. Jacob Newby, jnewby@pnj.com

The boss-employee relationship between Pensacola woman Donna Huelsbeck and Diana Petersen, of Somerville, Alabama, is far from typical.

That was made clear in 2010 when Petersen, an accountant suffering from the early stages of kidney failure, explained to her boss that she would one day need a kidney.

Huelsbeck had a compatible blood type, and without so much of a hint of trepidation, she told Petersen that when that day came, she would happily donate one of her kidneys.

""Back then, she told me, 'I'm going to give you a kidney,'"" Petersen recalled. ""You never know, in my situation, when you're going to need it. And a lot of people will say, 'I'll do it.' But I could tell, she was really gung-ho.""

Earlier this year, Huelsbeck made good on that commitment, saving Petersen with a kidney transplant at a time when the woman's bout with Polycystic Kidney Disease had taken a turn for the worse.

""Diana and I clicked from the very beginning,"" said Huelsbeck, who oversaw Petersen when the two worked together at J.H. Wright, an industrial equipment supplier in Alabama. ""No. 1, we hate to even say 'boss,' because she didn't need any supervising.""

While pregnant in 2008 with her now son Garrett, now 10, Petersen learned she had PKD.

""My father, my three uncles, my grandmother on my father's side and then my sister passed away at 26, and we found out during an autopsy that she had PKD, as well,"" Petersen said of her family's tragic battle with the incurable disease.

But Petersen didn't really feel the effects of the hereditary condition until 2018, which is common.

""It's a slow progression,"" said Laura Little, a Fresenius Kidney Care Nurse who helped Petersen with in-home dialysis. ""You don't really have symptoms until you've lost 75% of your kidney function.""

Petersen's kidney function dipped below 25% in 2018, and by September, she started dialysis. She didn't stop working though, often pulling 40-plus hour work weeks while doing her best to keep her condition veiled from her coworkers.

But Petersen admitted her energy was completely zapped.

""I refused to stop working, but I was tired all the time,"" Petersen explained. ""By 1, 2 p.m. in the afternoon, I was ready to go to bed. My husband had to pick up where I left off with taking Garrett to his baseball games. That's when I realized it's probably time to start dialysis. Once I did that, I felt a lot better.""

Volu: 86-year-old retired nurse volunteers weekly at Baptist Medical Park

Little began visiting Petersen's home late last year for home dialysis.

""I had to have a surgery to have a port put in, which, it was basically put in my abdomen, there was this 12-inch tube that came out. And that was a little bit shocking,"" Petersen said. ""When you wake up, you have this image. My little boy called it my 'tentacle.'""

Petersen eventually conducted home dialysis by herself, hooking up to a dialysis machine every day from 7:30 p.m. until 5:30 a.m. the next day.

The transplant surgery was originally estimated to take place this month, but Huelsbeck's son is a pitcher for the University of West Florida baseball team and she wanted to push up the surgery.

""I said it had to be either January or June, I wasn't going to miss any of his season,"" Huelsbeck said.

The sooner the better for Petersen, so the surgery took place Jan. 18 at UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama.

It went off without a hitch, and both women say they've been complication-free since the procedure. Petersen said she's up to 77% kidney function and feels better than she has in years.

""I'm extremely grateful,"" she said. ""It's a new life. I never realized how sick I was until the day after surgery. You wake up after surgery and automatically feel different.

""But I can't even explain to Donna how grateful I am,"" Petersen added. ""She's part of my family now.""

Though the two haven't worked together since 2012, they've obviously remained very close.

And even something so potentially divisive as Huelsbeck's Alabama Crimson Tide fandom and Petersen's love for the Auburn Tigers can't break their lifelong bond.

""Things are rocky in November when the Iron Bowl comes around,"" Huelsbeck joked. ""But now she's got some Crimson Tide blood in her.""

415,Dozens of crashes reported at intersection where boy was fatally struck by semi,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - A latest report from the Florida Highway Patrol shows there have been 24 crashes since 2017 at the intersection where a 10-year-old boy was fatally struck by a semitruck Wednesday afternoon.

Kevin Pope, 10, killed as a result of the crash on Landstar Boulevard and Wetherbee Road.

""This is all the time, trucks, bikes and kids,"" said Marz Aponte, pointing at an 18-wheeler driving down the road next to the subdivsion. ""It's very dangerous.""

Aponte is hoping to get parents together to share their concerns about traffic safety in the area.

The location of the crash is about a half mile from Wetherbee Elementary School. Aponte said her son and Pope rode their bikes to school together up until just last month when Aponte and her family moved.

""It's just tough when you have to explain to a 10-year-old that you have a young child he used to ride the bike with is no longer here,"" Aponte said, crying. ""It's tragic.""

She feels like it was only a matter of time.

At the beginning of the school year, she reached out to school officials and the county about getting more crossing guards, not just at the intersection where school lets out, but intersections along Wetherbee Road where neighborhoods are.

The Orange County Sheriff's Office said Thursday that there are already three crossing guards in the area, but will examine whether it's necessary to add more.

""Two are stationed directly across the street from the school on Club Woods Drive and Wetherbee Road. The other crosses children across Landstar Boulevard at Wetherbee Road on the opposite side from where the child was hit on Wetherbee Road,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have asked Orange County Traffic Engineering to reassess the intersection to determine if additional crossing guards are needed.""

Orange County will also be sending out traffic engineers to look at the area. Currently, the county has a list of schools to be evaluated for pedestrian safety.

Wetherbee Elementery was not included but now it will be.

District 4 County Commissioner Maribel Gomez Cordero in a statement said she will personally look into this as well.

""We are truly saddened by the loss of one of our children. Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and all affected by this tragic loss of young life. I am committed to reviewing the facts once presented, as well as ensuring that pedestrian safety remains a priority for all,"" Gomez Cordero said.

A GoFundMe has been established to help support Kevin's family.

416,"Pembroke Pines youth pastor accused of sexually abusing minor, false imprisonment","PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. - A Pembroke Pines man who served as a youth pastor at a local church was arrested Thursday on multiple counts of sexual abuse of a minor and false imprisonment.

Luis Clarke, 38, allegedly began a coercive sexual relationship with the victim in March 2016 when she was 16 years old. According to the victim, the abuse continued through March 2017.

An investigation by the Pembroke Pines Police Department found that during one of the sexual battery incidents at the suspect's residence, a 15-year-old boy witnessed the abuse inside the home.

When Clarke learned about the boy's presence, he allegedly turned on the home's alarm system so that neither minor could leave the residence.

After taking Clarke into custody, he admitted to several of the crimes which had occurred in Pembroke Pines and other South Florida cities.

Clarke was charged with 20 counts of Sexual Battery, 2 counts of False Imprisonment, Sexual Performance by a Child and Lewd & Lascivious Exhibition.

Because Clarke was a youth pastor at Abraza tu Sueño Church before it closed in 2018, police are asking parents with children who attended the church and are concerned about possible involvement with Clarke to contact them immediately.

421,"Boy, 4, dies after being burned while under care of mother's boyfriend, police say","Khalil Jabali, of Miami Gardens, is facing charges of aggravated child abuse and molestation of a child in connection with two separate incidents.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - A 4-year-old boy died Wednesday, days after he was burned while under the care of his mother's boyfriend, Miami Gardens police said.

According to a police report, Khalil Jabali, 23, was watching his girlfriend's three children Sunday while she was at work when the woman's son was burned by hot water that had been boiled in the microwave.

Police said Jabali called his girlfriend to tell her that the boy had wet his bed and was burned by hot water he had left in the bathroom when her younger child started crying.

Explaining that he had boiled water in the microwave so he could wash the boy's wet clothes, Jabali told police he left a bowl of hot water on the bathroom sink while he was in another room checking on the other child. When he returned to the bathroom, Jabali said he found the boy on the floor moaning and his skin peeling off.

The boy's mother left work and, along with Jabali, took her son to Jackson North Medical Center. He was then transferred to the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.

Police said the boy had burns to 15 percent of his body.

The boy also had other injuries, including bleeding around the brain and the chest cavity and broken ribs, authorities said.

The boy's body was taken to the Miami-Dade County medical examiner’s office, where an official cause of death will be determined.

Jabali was initially arrested on an aggravated child abuse charge. It's unclear whether that charge will be upgraded.

Jabali also faces a molestation charge involving a 6-year-old girl.

He remains in custody at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center without bond.

430,"John Singleton, maker of 'Boyz N the Hood,' dies at 51","NEW YORK — Director John Singleton, who made one of Hollywood's most memorable debuts with the Oscar-nominated ""Boyz N the Hood"" and continued over the following decades to probe the lives of black communities in his native Los Angeles and beyond, has died. He was 51.

Singleton's family said Monday that he died after being taken off life support, about two weeks after the director suffered a major stroke.

Singleton was in his early 20s, just out of the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, when he wrote, directed and produced ""Boyz N the Hood."" Based on Singleton's upbringing and shot in his old neighborhood, the low-budget production starred Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ice Cube and centered on three friends in South Central Los Angeles, where college aspirations competed with the pressures of gang life. ""Boyz N the Hood"" was a critical and commercial hit, given a 20-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and praised as a groundbreaking extension of rap to the big screen, a realistic and compassionate take on race, class, peer pressure and family. Singleton would later call it a ""rap album on film.""

For many, the 1991 release captured the explosive mood in Los Angeles in the months following the videotaped police beating of Rodney King. ""Boyz N the Hood"" also came out at a time when, thanks to the efforts to Spike Lee and others, black films were starting to get made by Hollywood after a long absence. Singleton became the first black director to receive an Academy Award nomination, an honor he would say was compensation for the academy's snubbing Lee and ""Do the Right Thing"" two years earlier, and was nominated for best screenplay. (""The Silence of the Lambs"" won in both categories). At 24, he was also the youngest director nominee in Oscar history.

""I think I was living this film before I ever thought about making it,"" Singleton told Vice in 2016. ""As I started to think about what I wanted to do with my life, and cinema became an option, it was just natural that this was probably gonna be my first film. In fact, when I applied to USC Film School they had a thing that asked you to write three ideas for films. And one of them was called Summer of '84, which was about growing up in South Central LA.""

In 2002, ""Boyz N the Hood' was added to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, which called it ""an innovative look at life and the tough choices present for kids growing up in South Central Los Angeles.""

None of Singleton's subsequent movies received the acclaim of ""Boyz N the Hood"" and he was criticized at times for turning characters into mouthpieces for political and social messages. But he attracted talent ranging from Tupac Shakur to Don Cheadle and explored themes of creative expression (""Poetic Justice""), identity (""Higher Learning"") and the country's racist past, notably in ""Rosewood,"" based on a murderous white rampage against a black community in Florida in 1923. He also made the coming-of-age story ""Baby Boy,"" a remake of the action film ""Shaft"" and an installment in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" More recent projects included the FX crime drama ""Snowfall,"" which he helped create. Starring Damson Idris, ""Snowfall"" returned Singleton to the Los Angeles of his youth and the destructive effects of the rise of crack cocaine.

""Drugs devastated a generation. It gave me something to write about, but I had to survive it first,"" Singleton told the Guardian in 2017. ""It made me a very angry young man. I didn't understand why I was so angry, but I wasn't someone who took my anger and applied it inward. I turned it into being a storyteller. I was on a kamikaze mission to really tell stories from my perspective — an authentic black perspective.""

Singleton was married twice, and had five children. Besides his career in movies, Singleton also directed the video for Michael Jackson's ""Remember the Time,"" which included Eddie Murphy and Magic Johnson. He cast hip-hop artists and other musicians in many of his films, including Ice Cube in ""Boyz N the Hood,"" Janet Jackson and Shakur in ""Poetic Justice"" and Tyrese Gibson in ""Baby Boy.""

Singleton's early success didn't shield him from creative conflicts or frustration with Hollywood studios. He blamed the commercial failure of ""Rosewood"" on lack of support from Warner Bros. He fought with producer Scott Rudin during the making of ""Shaft"" and was furious when Rudin brought in Richard Price to revise the script. He had planned to direct a biopic about Shakur, but quit after clashing with Morgan Creek Productions. In 2014, he chastised the industry for ""refusing to let African-Americans direct black-themed films,"" but Singleton was pleased in recent years by the emergence of Ava DuVernay, Barry Jenkins, Jordan Peele and others.

""There are these stacks of (films by non-black filmmakers) where black people have had to say, 'OK, at least they tried,'"" he told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018, adding that now blacks were making the films themselves. ""What's interesting when you see 'Black Panther' is you realize it couldn't have been directed by anybody else but Ryan Coogler. It's a great adventure movie and it works on all those different levels as entertainment, but it has this kind of cultural through-line that is so specific that it makes it universal.""",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190429/john-singleton-maker-of-boyz-n-hood-dies-at-51?rssfeed=true,2019-04-29T15:05:09Z,News Chief,Couple,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881

Tommy Paul is on an impressive run.

A week after winning the Elizabeth Moore Sarasota Open, the 21-year-old American from New Jersey advanced into Sunday's championship at the Tallahassee Tennis Challenger.

The No. 9-seeded Paul swept No. 2 seed Tennys Sandgren 6-4, 6-3 in Saturday's second semifinal at the Forestmeadows Tennis Complex. Emilio Gomez earned his slot in the title match with a 6-1, 6-4 upset of No. 3 seed Corentin Moutet in the first semifinal.

433,Nassau County schools investigating student's alleged threat,"CALLAHAN, Fla. - The Nassau County School District is investigating whether a third grader made death threats toward another student and her family.

Erin Christopherson, the mother of the student on the receiving end of the threat, said she didn’t even hear about it until her daughter recently came home from school upset.

Christopherson said her daughter was in the Callahan Intermediate School cafeteria when the topic of the Easter Bunny came up. She said a student snapped because no one agreed with him.

At some point, she said, things escalated.

“He looked directly at my daughter and said, ‘I’m going to rip your throat out, suffocate you with my lunchbox…and kill your mom,” Christopherson recalled her daughter saying.

Even though she doesn’t believe the child meant what he said, Christopherson expressed concern that the school district did not tell her about it, or remove the student from class.

“It’s really concerning to hear your 9-year-old who comes home at the end of the school day and you have not been notified by the administration,” she told News4Jax on Friday.

Christopherson raised those same concerns when she addressed the incident to the school board Thursday night in the hopes that her daughter would be separated from the boy.

She also shared what she had learned with the Nassau County Sheriff’s Office so investigators could document the incident in case anything else happened as a result.

The school district confirmed it is investigating the incident, but declined to go into detail, saying it cannot release additional information because of laws protecting student privacy.

Christopherson said she wishes she could meet with the boy’s family to discuss what happened between their children and clear the air.

“It would go a long way for my peace of mind if I knew that his parents were taking this as seriously as we are,” she said.

PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. - A South Florida man who served as a youth pastor at a Broward County church is accused of having sex with a minor after threatening to turn her and her family into immigration authorities, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

Luis Clarke, 38, of Pembroke Pines, was arrested Thursday morning and charged with 25 felony counts, including sexual battery of a minor and false imprisonment, according to court records.

The girl “never reported the sexual acts to her parents and went along with (Clarke’s) request because he threatened to report her and her family’s illegal status” to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, according to court records.

Clarke, who was a part-time youth pastor at the defunct Abrazo tu Sueno Church, in Pembroke Pines, allegedly began the sexual relationship with the victim in March 2016 when she was 16, the Sun-Sentinel reported. The victim told authorities the abuse continued through March 2017, the newspaper reported.

According to Pembroke Pines police, one of the sexual battery incidents at Clarke’s residence was witnessed by a 15-year-old boy, WPLG reported. Police said when he learned the boy was present, he turned on his home’s alarm system so neither juvenile could leave, the television station reported.

The boy reported the incident to police April 3, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

Clarke gave a sworn statement to authorities after his arrest and admitted to two sexual encounters with the girl, the newspaper reported. He told police the boy had been to his home but denied the minor had been there while he was having sex with the girl, Detective Alkie Lewis-Siminies wrote in a police report.

436,Cops: South Fla. youth pastor used ICE threat to force sex with girl,"Authorities say Luis Clarke, 38, faces 20 counts of sexual battery, two counts of false imprisonment, sexual performance by a child and lewd and lascivious exhibition.

PEMBROKE PINES — Authorities say a 38-year-old youth pastor at a now defunct South Florida church coerced a girl into having sex with him by threatening to turn her family in to immigration officials.

The Sun Sentinel reports Luis Clarke assaulted the 15-year-old girl over six months in 2016 and 2017 while he was a part-time youth pastor at Abrazo tu Sueno Church in Pembroke Pines. Clarke was arrested Thursday.

Pembroke Pines police said he faces 20 counts of sexual battery, two counts of false imprisonment, sexual performance by a child and lewd and lascivious exhibition.

Police Capt. Al Xiques says Clarke once forced a 15-year-old boy to watch him assault the girl. The boy went to police on April 3.

The report says Clarke admitted to two sexual encounters with the girl.

439,"Hate-filled posts draw concern from Creekside High students, parents","ST. JOHNS, Fla. - Some Creekside High School parents and students said they're upset over hate-filled social media posts.

There appear to be four pictures total, with two on each post. The first post involved two pictures, one showing two Creekside High School teenage girls who appear to be naked in a bathtub with swastikas drawn on their bodies, as well as on a wall behind them.

The district said those pictures are linked to two other offensive posts that followed from a teenage boy, who parents and students told News4Jax is a senior at Creekside High School. Those two pictures were also seen on Snapchat.

Paul Abbatinozzi, senior director of school services for the St. Johns County School District, said four students are facing punishment for the posts, which he said did not occur on school grounds or during school hours.

""They're certainly offensive. They have no place within the educational system or in society at all. They're inappropriate,"" Abbatinozzi said. ""When an incident happens sometimes off-campus there is still an impact felt at the school level. Students became offended.""

Due to privacy concerns, the district said it can’t talk about the consequences the four students are facing, but students and parents told News4Jax the four students involved received several days of out-of-school suspension, a punishment Kamryn Courson, a senior, said she doesn’t feel is enough.

""It was really upsetting. I go to the school and it’s all over the news,"" Courson said. ""It’s just embarrassing.”

The St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office was also involved and said there was no criminal investigation because no crime was committed. Detectives did a threat assessment at the home of the teenage boy, which the Sheriff’s Office said did not reveal anything.

The district said the principal has met with several students individually, as well as in groups, including a group of Jewish students.

Abbatinozzi said the principal will continue to make himself available to any students who wish to talk about the posts.

Police believe an Illinois couple who reported their 5-year-old son missing last week killed him days earlier by beating him and forcing him to stand in a cold shower for an extended period of time, according to court documents released Thursday.The allegations are included in a criminal complaint that outlines first-degree murder, aggravated battery and several other charges against Joann Cunningham, 36, and Andrew Freund Sr., 60, in the death of Andrew “AJ” Freund. A judge on Thursday set bail at $5 million, meaning each parent would have to post 10%, or $500,000, to be released from jail.An autopsy was scheduled for later Thursday to determine a cause of death and to confirm that the remains found a day earlier wrapped in plastic and buried in a shallow grave are those of the child, as investigators believe.Investigators say they found the body a few miles from the family’s Crystal Lake home based on information provided by Freund. Crystal Lake is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Chicago. The couple’s brief court appearance Thursday came exactly a week after Freund triggered a massive search on April 18 when he called 911 to report that the couple hadn’t seen their son since bedtime the night before. Police believe the boy was killed April 15, according to the criminal complaint.Authorities say the boy had lived in deplorable conditions.“It is my hope that you may have some solace in knowing that AJ is no longer suffering and his killers have been brought to justice,” Crystal Lake Police Chief James Black told reporters Wednesday, in a statement directed at the child’s relatives.The Illinois Department of Children and Family Service had a long history with the family — including an investigation that was launched shortly after AJ was born when tests revealed there were opiates in his body that prompted the agency to place the boy in foster care for nearly two years.Crystal Lake police also have repeatedly been called to the family’s house. Officers in police reports described finding filthy living conditions, broken windows, evidence of drug use and the overpowering smell of dog feces.After AJ’s parents reported him missing, authorities immediately placed his younger brother in the custody of state welfare workers.Lawyers from the McHenry County public defender’s office represented the parents during Thursday’s hearing, and it was unclear whether they had hired private attorneys.

441,Grief counselors comfort students at Orlando elementary school after boy's death,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Grief counselors are comforting students at Wetherbee Elementary School after a student was fatally struck by a semitruck while walking home on Wednesday.

Outside the school, parents said the family of Kevin Pope, 10, has been in their prayers and many have been having conversations with their children about what happened.

""As a parent, that's just crushing,"" Julius Buie said. ""I've been teaching my daughter about safety awareness and making sure you definitely look both ways when you cross the street.""

The crash happened around 2:30 p.m. at the intersection of Wetherbee Road and Landstar Boulevard, which is less than a half mile from the school.

According to the Florida Highway Patrol, Pope was crossing in a crosswalk and a semi was turning right when the middle portion of the trailer hit the child.

The truck did not stop, but troopers said they're not classifying the crash as a hit-and-run because the driver likely didn't know the child was struck.

""It appeared the boy tried to swerve away from the semi and was struck from the center portion of the trailer portion of the semitruck,"" Lt. Kim Montes said.

Cornelius Smith and his son witnessed the crash. The two walked to school together early Thursday.

""I don't know what it's like to lose a child, but that was like an up close encounter yesterday for me and it was also eye opening,"" Smith said.

According to FHP, troopers have looked at more than 100 trucks in the area, but haven't been able to identify the vehicle connected to the crash.

Troopers said charges are pending against the driver as the crash remains under investigation.

UPDATE: The body of the missing Crystal Lake 5-year-old, Andrew “AJ” Freund, has been found, according to a source close to the case the Chicago Tribune reports.

CHICAGO (AP) — The mother of a 5-year-old suburban Chicago boy who went missing last week is refusing to cooperate with detectives, police said Monday.

JoAnn Cunningham has declined to say anything further to police since her initial report that Andrew “AJ” Freund had disappeared sometime between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Crystal Lake Deputy Chief Tom Kotlowski said.

“She is a valuable resource because she was the last to see Andrew,” Kotlowski said, adding that the boy’s father, Andrew Freund, has spoken to detectives.

Cunningham does not have a listed telephone number and could not be reached for comment. Her attorney, George Kililis, did not immediately return a call for comment on Monday, but late last week he told reporters that Cunningham had been cooperative “until at some point we got the impression that she may be considered a suspect.”

On Monday, Kotlowski said police K-9 teams have searched the area in and around the house in the heavily wooded community about 50 miles northwest of Chicago, and investigators are confident that the boy did not wander away on foot.

Police have said there is no evidence the boy was abducted. A news release Monday said the investigation is “focusing on the residence and the individuals that may have seen or had contact with “AJ” last.”

In the days after the boy disappeared, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services said that it has had previous contact with the family — stemming in part from the fact that the boy was born with opiates in his system. DCFS said the boy spent nearly two years in foster care before he was returned to his parents. DCFS had contact twice with the family in 2018 but deemed the allegations of neglect and abuse unfounded.

Meanwhile, when the boy disappeared last week, a younger son was placed into DCFS custody. The Northwest Herald reports that Cunningham is trying to regain custody of the younger boy and a hearing at the McHenry County courthouse is scheduled for Tuesday.",http://www.wfla.com/national/mother-of-missing-illinois-5-year-old-not-talking-to-police/1950001084,2019-04-24T17:03:46Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

455,Out of the hospital; still in the woods,"An alarm sounds whenever Brenden Charles Fisher stops breathing.

Two or three times each night, it draws his sleepy parents to a crib where they find the baby’s body arched and rigid and his eyes wide open. They suction saliva from his airway and cuddle him back to sleep.

Appointments with doctors and specialists fill each day.

His parents shuttle him from one clinic to the next for a slew of treatments to help their baby breathe, swallow and move.

He also needs a steady supply of medical equipment. Boxes containing new feeding tubes, syringes and gauze pads land on the doorstep regularly. So do dozens of medical bills from various providers totaling more than $700,000, and climbing.

The Sarasota baby who suffered catastrophic brain damage during an attempted out-of-hospital breech delivery with a Rosemary Birthing Home midwife is home now after nearly two months in the hospital.

But his long-term prognosis remains unclear, and his parents’ fight for justice continues despite Rosemary’s recent announcement it will close next month after more than a decade of operation.

“I’m glad Rosemary is shutting down, and I’m honestly surprised it took so long,” said Brenden’s father, Jason Fisher. “But I’m not satisfied. Midwives need to have more education, more oversight, more insurance. I don’t know how the state let this happen.”

Brenden’s injury was the latest incident at the Rosemary, which was profiled last year as part of a nine-month investigation by GateHouse Media and the Herald-Tribune into the dangers of out-of-hospital births.

[READ MORE: Failure to Deliver: How the rise of out-of-hospital births puts mothers and babies at risk, a special investigation by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune and GateHouse Media.]

One of the area’s two birth centers, Rosemary has had a troubled history that includes at least three infant deaths and a rash of hospital transfers. At least one of the deaths was due to a congenital heart defect and not preventable, according to the child’s mother.

Plans for a lawsuit

Fisher and his wife, Paris Bean, checked into Rosemary Birthing Home early Jan. 30, excited to deliver their first child.

Hours later, the baby went into cardiac arrest and respiratory failure after midwife Jordan Shockley unsuccessfully attempted to deliver him breech — foot first instead of head first — without consulting a physician or transferring care as state regulations require.

The baby’s lower half emerged, but his head became stuck in the birth canal and he went into distress. Paramedics rushed mother and child to Sarasota Memorial Hospital, performing chest compressions on his partially exposed body after he went into cardiac arrest.

Brenden was delivered with no pulse or heartbeat and had to be revived at the hospital. He suffered severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and registered no brain activity, according to a hospital spokeswoman and the family.

Doctors transferred Brenden that night to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg. No one expected him to survive.

“He is such a miracle,” Bean said Wednesday from her Sarasota home, where she cradled Brenden in her arms. “We don’t let ourselves get angry. We stay focused on the positives. We have to stay strong for him.”

Brenden beat the odds. He is alive and breathing on his own. He makes eye contact, holds his head up, rolls over, kicks and coos.

But he has not fully recovered, and doctors don’t know if he ever will, the family said.

He has no gag reflex and cannot swallow — all his food comes from a tube. His most recent evaluation returned the same diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy that he got his first day of life.

Caused by a lack of blood and oxygen to the brain, HIE can result in numerous lifelong issues including epilepsy, cognitive impairments, motor problems and developmental delays.

The family hired an attorney and plans to file a lawsuit against both Rosemary Birthing Home and Shockley.

The state Department of Health opened a case on the incident in February, Bean said, but the agency declined to publicly confirm or deny that. If the investigation finds Shockley violated state midwifery regulations, the state can revoke her license.

But such actions are rare.

In the past decade, Florida formally pursued discipline on just 36 of the 170 midwifery complaints — at least 10 involving fatal incidents. It revoked only one license during that time, although six other midwives voluntarily surrendered theirs after facing allegations.

Neither Shockley nor Rosemary’s owner, Harmony Miller, responded to numerous requests for comment.

Rosemary is set to close its doors May 12.

More requirements needed

Florida midwives must have a high school diploma, graduate from an accredited midwifery school and attend at least 50 births under a senior midwife before obtaining their state-issued license.

Unlike certified nurse midwives, they are not required to have master's-level nursing degrees.

Bean and Fisher said that should change.

“I always thought a midwife was a supposed to be a qualified nurse,” Fisher said. “I had no idea they were not nurses. Or that they’re not even considered medical professionals.”

The couple believes Florida should require more education, more clinical experience and more liability insurance for licensed midwives who practice outside the hospital. Currently, the state mandates midwives carry $100,000 per incident and $300,000 aggregate.

It’s rarely enough to cover the cost of a lawsuit, making it difficult to find attorneys to take a case against a midwife, several lawyers told GateHouse Media last year.

Fisher said midwives should have to carry at least $500,000 per incident.

Even that amount wouldn’t cover the family’s medical bills — the flight-for-life helicopter ride alone was $39,000, according to the bill from Med-Trans Air Medical Transport.

Nor would that amount cover the continued care the little boy could require the rest of his life.

But the family tries not to focus on the future. Fisher and Bean said they take it one day at a time.

“Every single day, we walk into his room and say, ‘We need a miracle to happen,’” Fisher said. “And at the end of every day, when we walk out, we realize it was a good day.”

Cuddles and gift cards

Before the baby, Fisher and Bean ran The Green Bean Coffee House on Bradenton Road. They served specialty drinks, fresh juices, sandwiches and pastries to a mostly college-student crowd.

But they closed the café after Brenden’s birth injury — first, so they could be with him at All Children’s Hospital; now so they can be with him at home. They plan to reopen in the fall.

Between the diaper changes and doctor’s appointments, the couple spends time trying to stimulate Brenden’s brain with different activities, like going to the aquarium and getting extra tummy time.

“We also cuddle a lot,” Bean said.

While the café remains closed, the family relies on income from Fisher’s other job doing home repairs, remodeling and maintenance work as The Sandyland Handyman.

They also have received overwhelming support from the community.

“Everybody has been so generous,” Bean said. “We have people bringing us meals, people offering their services. A local church — Sarasota Community Church — dropped off gift cards and gas cards for us.”

And the family’s GoFundMe account raised more than $22,600 from nearly 250 individual donations in the past two months. Money will go toward helping the family get back on its feet.

Fisher and Bean said they’re humbled by the support.

“We have been blessed with so much,” Fisher said. “When you start at rock bottom with doctors telling you your baby is going to die, every day we get with him is a miracle.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190429/out-of-hospital-still-in-woods?rssfeed=true,2019-04-29T04:01:00Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

According to attendees, his four-wheeler was hit head-on.

As news spread on Facebook, comments poured in from people checking on their loved ones.

Some people questioned if the combination of alcohol and offroading is safe.

“Unfortunately, sometimes people run into one another,” Skeet Alford, part owner of the property, said.

“It’s just the exception, it’s not the common thing. Every now and then, sometimes, things happen.”

In 2012, a 3-year-old-boy died at the park after being run over by his aunt.

Action News Jax went on a ridealong with the property owners Saturday.

They said they work hard to ensure the park is safe for families.

They always have at least two off-duty deputies on site along with emergency medical services personnel, they said.

Each person is also required to sign a liability release waiver warning of the risk for injury or death.

“I mean we know what we’re getting into at the end of the day,” Franco said.

Action News Jax asked property owners if they planned to bring more off-duty deputies on-site after the crash Friday.

The owners said deputies can ask for additional security at the owner’s expense if they feel it's necessary.

The identities of the two people involved in the crash have not been released. Action News Jax has requested the Florida Highway Patrol report and more information from troopers.

458,"Viewpoint: Adopt greyhounds, make fast friends","Buy Photo Marlette's Florida Election Cartoons (Photo: Andy Marlette, amarlette@pnj.com)

Have you ever rescued a greyhound? If not, you’re missing out on a gentle companion that could change both of your lives for the better.

Florida’s recent election allowed voters to decide if greyhound racing should be banned.

The voters spoke.

Greyhound racing in Florida will be phased out by Dec 31, 2020.

So what does this mean? It means that commercial dog racing will no longer be in operation. It also means that other forms of gambling at these dog tracks will not be affected (slots and card games).

I am thrilled the ban passed because I have rescued greyhounds, and I know the tales behind the tails.

When I lived in Florence, AL, I vacationed here along the panhandle, more specifically, Destin. The people I traveled with at the time loved going to the Ebro Greyhound Racing Park and Poker Room in Ebro, FL. I didn’t care about the racing part but loved going to pet the greyhounds. They usually had a couple out that you could go visit.

Granted, this was many years ago and I wasn’t sure how I felt about greyhounds being used as racing dogs for entertainment. I did not know how they were treated, and they all looked a little malnourished.

One good thing I can say about this particular track is that they promoted adoption. Because of my few visits to the park, I became involved with greyhound adoption.

After careful consideration, I adopted my first greyhound back in 1997. Her racing name was Laurel, but I quickly changed it to Maggie. She was a black, beautiful girl with a gentle disposition and loving personality.

She wasn’t a good racer and was only two-years-old when I adopted her. The reasoning for this was because she did not make her owners any money. So, instead of allowing her to be euthanized, I made her a member of my family. I didn’t care that her teeth were in horrible shape due to the high protein foods she was fed at the track; I loved her all the same.

She lived to the age of seven, sadly passing away from kidney failure while I held her in my arms. Putting her down was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, but it was comforting knowing that I gave her a chance at life—a life of being spoiled, plenty of hugs and kisses, long walks and a big backyard to run in.

Some argue that greyhounds enjoy their racing lifestyle. Obviously I am not a greyhound, so I wouldn’t know.

What I do know is that Maggie did not have to be in a kennel for 23 hours a day, and she did not have to chase a fake rabbit that she never had a chance to catch, risking injury in the process.

Before Maggie passed, I adopted a big, beautiful 4-year-old gray boy named Maverick. Maverick was a sure fire bet back in his heyday; he made his owners money in the many races he won, as well as the people that bet on him. However, when Maverick tore his right shoulder muscle during a race, he was no longer any use to his owners, so he was put up for adoption.

He could have easily been put down, but thanks to the greyhound adoption program, I was able to adopt him and give him a loving home. He also gained a sister to share his retired racing life with.

There is a slogan that refers to retired greyhounds as “couch potatoes.” Maverick eased into his role as a retired racer as easily as a puppy eases into a warm blanket. He had a big backyard where he could run his laps. Afterward, he curled up in his favorite oversized leather chair.

He was not put into a crate with little to no interaction.

Maverick sadly passed at the age of nine, but he fully enjoyed his retired life. I take comfort in that.

Declining revenue and concerns of animal cruelty have caused 40 states to ban the sport. Florida was one of the last states to hold out, however, Florida is home to twelve of the tracks in the U.S., so this amendment passing was a huge victory for those that oppose it.

Scare tactics were used leading up to the election; those against the ban claimed that 8,000 greyhounds would be euthanized because they will have nowhere else to go. When Massachusetts banned the sport in January of 2010, there was a record for adoptions in the state (according to state records).

I say to you all: There are plenty of adoption programs out there that will take these dogs in. The adoption process ensures that they greyhounds are placed in the right homes, so you can rest assured that your new best friend is a perfect fit.

I cannot recommend adopting a greyhound enough. They are so sweet and gentle, and training them is a breeze. They are already kennel trained, so all that is required is weaning them out of their kennels and into your home.

Devin White is just a ""small town country boy from Louisiana,"" trying to make a big impact in his first season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The linebacker out of LSU, selected 5th overall by the Bucs, will essentially be replacing Kwon Alexander at linebacker in a system he feels very comfortable in.

He said when he met with Bucs Defensive Coordinator Todd Bowles prior to the draft, he saw a lot of similarities between Bowles' 3-4 defense and the defensive scheme he played at while still at LSU.

White says this makes him feel much more confident in his ability to make the transition from college to the NFL with ease.

Head Coach Bruce Arians was thrilled about getting White a that #5 spot, as White was the organization's top choice per GM Jason Licht Thursday night.

Arians said he was impressed with White's pass-rushing ability up the middle in addition to his speed and ability to cover.

On a personal level, White brings energy to every room that leaves a lasting impact on you.

He's humble yet confident and has referred to being able to wear a Buccaneers uniform as a blessing.

The young rookie has a long road ahead in terms of proving himself to his teammates and to Bucs fans, but he's up to the challenge.

460,"Crosswalks, sidewalks to be added outside First Coast High","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - New pedestrian safety measures, including crosswalks and sidewalks, are planned to be added this summer outside First Coast High School on Jacksonville’s Northside.

The city's plan comes months after a freshman student was hit by a pickup truck the morning of Jan. 18 while crossing Duval Station Road on his way to class. The teenage boy suffered a broken leg and was expected to recover.

After that incident, the city told News4Jax that it was studying pedestrian movements in the area of the school, located at the intersection of Duval Station and Starratt roads. The city completed a report that showed justification for installing marked pedestrian crossings.

That study and report by the city can be partially credited to First Coast High parent Tiffany Clark, who had city officials do a walk through with her one morning, giving them an idea of how bad traffic conditions were for students trying to cross the road.

In an email to Clark, city traffic engineer Christopher LeDew said, ""We will be installing three crosswalks with Rapid Rectangular Flashing Beacons (RRFB’s) and sidewalks.""

As of Friday afternoon, News4Jax was awaiting a response from the city on where exactly the three crosswalks will be located.

Students and parents have told News4Jax on multiple occasions that crosswalks are needed, as there currently aren’t any at either entrance of the school. One entrance is on Duval Station Road and the other is on Starratt Road.

The city also said in the email that the speed limits on both roads would be lowered from 45 mph to 40 mph.

Students told News4Jax on Friday that they think the crosswalks will help with safety, but they’re not sure lowering the speed limit will, saying, unfortunately, speeders will continue to speed.

""People are still going to speed,"" said 17-year-old Jarari Gilyard, a senior at First Coast High. ""They drive fast regardless.""

According to the city, the work is scheduled to begin in the summer and should be completed by next school year.

First Coast High School Principal Timothy Simmons issued the following statement:

We are so thankful to our incredibly engaged school community and the City of Jacksonville for working collaboratively to ensure that the paths our children use for school are safer.""

463,"Video: Teen burglary suspects swim through lake to avoid arrest, deputies say","VOLUSIA COUNTY, Fla. - Helicopter video shows deputies taking down three teenage vehicle burglary suspects who swam through a lake in an attempt to avoid arrest, according to the Volusia County Sheriff's Office.

Authorities said a DeLand resident reported an in-progress vehicle break-in around 4 a.m. Wednesday. While deputies on the ground and the Sheriff's Office helicopter unit were searching for the suspects, a black Honda that had been reported stolen out of Deltona was seen in the area, a news release said.

The vehicle was driven off when deputies attempted a traffic stop, traveling with its lights out on East New York Avenue until it came to a stop on Lakeview Drive in Lake Helen, according to authorities.

The 15-year-old driver and two other teenage boys got out of the vehicle and fled into a heavily wooded area before jumping into the lake.

""Oh, they're in the water now,"" the helicopter pilot told deputies on the ground.

Two of the boys swam across the lake toward Lake Macy, where they were arrested. The third got out of the water along the lakeshore, continuing to lead deputies on a chase and refusing to follow commands until he was bitten by a K-9, the report said.

The boy was treated at the scene, then taken to an area hospital.

Deputies said they found stolen property in the Honda and they believe the teens are linked to vehicle burglaries in DeLand, DeBary and Seminole County.

The boys are facing multiple charges.

The body of a 5-year-old boy reported as missing last week was found wrapped in plastic in a shallow grave on Wednesday, and his parents have been charged with murder, police said.Crystal Lake Police Chief Jim Black said police interviewed the parents of Andrew ""AJ"" Freund overnight after information was obtained through forensic analysis of their cell phone data.The parents, Andrew Freund Sr. and JoAnn Cunningham, then provided information that ultimately led to the recovery of AJ's body in Woodstock, Illinois, about 10 miles from their home in Crystal Lake, police said.They both face charges of first-degree murder, aggravated battery and aggravated domestic battery and failure to report a missing or child's death, Black said. Freund Sr. also faces charges of concealment of homicidal death, police said.The cause of death is unknown at this time.""To AJ's family: It is my hope that you may have some solace in knowing that AJ is no longer suffering and his killers have been brought to justice,"" Black said.The search began last Thursday morning when his father calmly called police and reported him as missing.""We have a missing child,"" he said, according to a 911 call released by the Crystal Lake Police Department on Tuesday. ""Woke up this morning and he wasn't ... he wasn't.""Freund told a 911 dispatcher that he put AJ to bed in his pajamas last Wednesday night but could not find him in the morning before school.""I had a doctor appointment this morning and when I got back from the doctor's appointment and I checked in on him to say good morning and he wasn't there,"" the father told the dispatcher Thursday.He said he searched all around the house and canvassed the neighborhood but couldn't find him.The resulting search has included 15 police agencies, drones, and rescue canine units. But police said it was likely that AJ had not walked away and was not abducted, and instead focused the investigation on the family home.Sonar teams that searched Crystal Lake found nothing, and the canine teams ""only picked up Andrew's 'scent' within the residence, indicating that Andrew had not walked away on foot,"" the police said.""(T)here is no indication that would lead police to believe that an abduction had taken place,"" the department said in a statement.In addition, Crystal Lake Police earlier said Cunningham ""continues to be uncooperative with police.""Child welfare investigationsPolice on Tuesday released 63 pages of reports detailing several police calls to Andrew's home in recent years. In December, for instance, an officer described unlivable conditions in the home with ""dog feces and urine"" scattered there.The officer during the visit also reported a suspicious bruise on one of the children, but a child welfare worker was unable to make a determination of abuse, the report said. Someone at the house said it may have been caused by a dog.Months earlier, a local resident called police to check on the children because the home had been without power for weeks, according to the reports. An officer wrote the two children appeared ""healthy and happy"" and that child welfare authorities said the lack of electricity did not warrant their investigation.The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has ""been involved with the family"" since AJ's birth, department spokesman Jassen Strokosch told CNN.

CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill. (AP) — Authorities on Wednesday dug up the body of a 5-year-old Illinois boy who was reported missing last week and charged his parents with murder and other counts.

The body, believed to be that of Andrew “AJ” Freund, was wrapped in plastic and buried in a shallow grave in a rural area of Woodstock, Crystal Lake police Chief James Black said at a news conference. Woodstock is about 50 miles northwest of Chicago and a few miles from the family’s home in Crystal Lake.

Black said investigators were led to the body after they interviewed the boy’s parents overnight and presented them with cellphone evidence.

The parents, Andrew Freund Sr. and JoAnn Cunningham, each face five counts of first-degree murder and other charges, including aggravated battery.

In a message intended for the slain boy, the chief said, “We know you are at peace playing in heaven’s playground and are happy you no longer have to suffer.”

Black said his efforts are underway to confirm that the body is AJ’s and that his department won’t be releasing further details in an effort to protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation.

Officers removed several items from the family home on Wednesday, including a shovel, mattress, paper bags and a plastic storage tub.

Authorities said the couple reported AJ missing on Thursday and told officers they had last seen him at bedtime the previous night.

Early on in their investigation, though, police said they didn’t believe the boy was abducted or that he had left the home on foot. They also said they were “focusing on the residence and the individuals that may have seen or had contact with AJ last,” and that Cunningham wasn’t cooperating with detectives.

On Tuesday, the department released more than 60 pages of police reports written by officers who responded to various calls about the house, which is about 45 miles (72 kilometers) northwest of Chicago.

One report described seeing the home littered with dog feces and urine, and a children’s bedroom where “the smell of feces was overwhelming.” Another report said the officer found the house to be “cluttered, dirty and in disrepair,” and without electrical power.

The heavily-redacted reports also indicate state child welfare workers were called after officers spotted a large bruise on one of the young boys living there, but that the children appeared to be “healthy and happy” and were not removed from the house.

Cunningham and Freund were in court Tuesday seeking custody of their 4-year-old son, Parker. Parker was taken into custody by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services on Thursday after Andrew was reported missing by his parents.",https://www.wfla.com/national/5-year-old-illinois-boy-s-body-found-in-shallow-grave-parents-charged-with-murder/1950001084,2019-04-24T20:16:58Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

<p>According to an arrest report, a 6-year-old girl was interviewed by detectives Monday and said that Khalil Jabali, 23, touched her vagina over her clothing while she was lying on her mother's bed at their home in Miami Gardens.</p>

<p>Police said the incident occurred when the victim was 5.</p>

<p>During the interview, the girl was able to make a distinction between the truth and a lie, authorities said.</p>

<p>Local 10 News is withholding the relationship between Jabli and the victim to protect the child's identity.</p>

<p>Jabali remains in custody at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center.</p>

<p>According to a police report, Jabali was watching his girlfriend's three children Sunday while she was at work when the woman's 4-year-old son was burned by hot water that had been boiled in the microwave.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Police said Jabali called his girlfriend to tell her that the boy had wet his bed and was burned by hot water that he left in the bathroom when her younger child started crying.</p>

<p>Explaining that he had boiled water in the microwave so he could wash the boy's wet clothes, Jabali told police he left a bowl of hot water on the bathroom sink while he was in another room checking on the other child. When he returned to the bathroom, Jabali said he found the boy on the floor moaning and his skin peeling off.</p>

<p>The boy's mother left work and, along with Jabali, took her son to Jackson North Medical Center. He was then transferred to the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.</p>

<p>Police said the boy had burns to 15 percent of his body.</p>

<p>""They do not know if he is going to survive, and if he does he will likely be in a vegetative state,"" a prosecutor told Miami-Dade County Judge Renatha Francis during Jabali's bond hearing Monday morning.</p>

<p>Police said the boy had other injuries, including bleeding around the brain and the chest cavity and broken ribs. </p>

<p>The prosecutor said paramedics were never called.</p>

<p>Francis initially set Jabali's bond at $10,000. She also ordered him to remain on house arrest upon his release and to stay at least 500 feet away from the child.</p>

<p>However, Jabali reappeared in court Tuesday, at which time Francis ordered him held without bond due to the new charge. He was also ordered to have no contact with either victim. </p>",https://www.local10.com/news/florida/miami-dade/man-accused-of-burning-girlfriends-son-also-faces-molestation-charge,2019-04-23T14:53:15Z,WPLG,Couple,"3401 W Hallandale Beach Blvd, Pembroke Park, FL 33023, USA",FL,33023
472,Burt Reynolds honored during Florida State's Pillars of Champions ceremony,"CLOSE The unveiling of an honor for the Bandit at FSU. Jim Henry, Democrat sports editor

Bobby Bowden reckoned there has never been an actor in Hollywood who had more humility than Burt Reynolds.

""When he came around, he was like one of us,"" Bowden said.

One of us, of course, was a Seminole.

For life.

Though Reynolds played only parts of two seasons (1954 and 1957) at Florida State before a knee injury ended his football career, his connection to the Seminoles remained genuine and strong. Reynolds went on to become an iconic movie star, director and sex symbol, but he always treasured his return trips to Tallahassee during football season.

Reynolds, who died last September at the age 82, was honored Friday night in the Dunlap Champions Club at Doak Campbell Stadium. Seminole Boosters, Inc., held the fourth installment in its Pillars of Champions series with the pillar unveiling and ceremony recognizing Reynolds.

Special guests included Reynolds' son Quinton Reynolds and his niece Nancy Lee Hess. The ceremony featured introductions from Gene Deckerhofff, a video of Reynolds, a heartfelt speech of thanks from Hess and, of course, Bowden's witty storytelling. Reynolds, a running back, ran for 146 career yards on 19 carries and scored two touchdowns at FSU.

""To him, FSU football and coach Bowden were as much a part of his life as his film career,"" Hess told the crowd. ""If he couldn't be here in Tallahassee for his game, I can assure every TV in his home was turned to the Seminole game. We all know what home means to each of us. Home is a place where you feel comfort, love and respect for who you are, This is why FSU meant so much to him. This is how he felt when he was here.

""It was his home.""

Bowden, the Seminoles' legendary football coach who retired following the 2009 season, told the group how Reynolds stopped by his office on Fridays when he was in town for games. Bowden shut the door and said the pair told stories and ""laughed and laughed and laughed. I really enjoyed that,' Bowden said.

Bowden, with tongue in cheek, explained how Reynolds went on a recruiting trip with him to Ohio back when alumni were permitted to do so. ""How can I get a better (recruiter) than Burt Reynolds?"" Bowden said. ""That would open some eyes."" Bowden explained the prospective recruit lived with his mother and didn't have a father.

""While I am sitting there recruiting that boy, Burt is talking to the momma. … you understand,"" Bowden said as the crowd laughed. ""Then we went out for supper. Back in those days you could take them out for supper. We go out to supper and have a good visit, momma and Burt, me and the boy. While the boy and I were talking football, Burt was out there dancing with the momma.""

Bowden, saying he wanted to make a long story short, told the crowd that FSU didn't land the recruit. He went to Notre Dame.

But....

""The momma came to Florida State,"" Bowden said.

On a serious note, Bowden also told the crowd that when he, along with wife Ann and his longtime football secretary Sue Hall, attended Reynolds' 80th birthday party in his hometown of Jupiter, Reynolds shared his testimony with him.

""He said Jesus Christ was his savior,"" Bowden said. ""That means he's right up there (pointing skyward), watching us. I know he's laughing.""

The event was capped by the unveiling of Reynolds' pillar by Reynolds' son Quinton that features a large image of the Seminole player. Quinton, 30, who resides in Los Angeles, is the adopted son of Reynolds and his ex-wife, actress Loni Anderson. Reynolds once hailed Quinton as “his greatest achievement” in life.

Quinton told the Democrat he enjoyed his trips to Tallahassee with his father as a youth. Family and friends toured FSU's athletic facility and campus Friday and was scheduled to attend Saturday's spring game at Doak Campbell Stadium.

""This is absolutely fantastic,"" said Quinton, who is yes-sir, no-sir polite.

""This is an honor to be here, it's a please to be at this school of all schools. I grew up with Florida State. Watching games, visiting coach Bowden, Mr. (Gene) Deckerhoff, being able to meet him and grow up with them, that's Florida State. That's the energy, that's the vibe. Knowing them was everything. This facility is absolutely fantastic. Seeing the film program here is phenomenal.

""Who wouldn't want to come here? I would want to come here all over again.""

474,Florida mom charged after young son nearly drowns in pool,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - The mother of a 3-year-old boy who nearly drowned in a jacuzzi at a Florida resort has been charged with neglect of a child after she was found to be intoxicated and using drugs.

Apryl Connolly, 36, was arrested after video showed the boy sinking to the bottom of the jacuzzi at Perry's Ocean Edge Resort in Daytona Beach, WKMG reports.

Connolly was supposed to be watching her two sons, but instead was drinking tequila and smoking pot.

A hotel security employee noticed the boy stepping into the jacuzzi and disappearing. The employee contacted another staff member who pulled the boy out.

After being given CPR, the boy was resuscitated after he was not breathing. The child was taken to a nearby hospital, but is expected to recover and has since been released.

Connolly admitted to officers that she had taken three shots of tequila and was mixing alcohol with pills. She was later released on her own recognizance.

481,"1 week, 2 dead in separate Orange County hit-and-run crashes involving large trucks","Kevin Montalvo Lopez, 23, died Friday after he was taken off life support. His death marks the second fatal hit and run crash involving a large truck this week in Orange County. (Image courtesy of Lopez family)

ORLANDO, Fla. - Kevin Montalvo Lopez's family made the decision Friday to take him off life-support four days after the 23-year-old was hit by with dump truck while on his motorcycle.

The crash happened at the intersection of Orange Blossom Trail and Kaley Avenue around 6 a.m., according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The driver of the truck said they had no idea Lopez was hit.

According to the crash report, the semi dump truck was traveling southbound on Orange Blossom Trail and attempted to make a left to turn on Kaley Avenue. When the semitruck turned, the motorcycle driven by Lopez struck the right, rear tire of the truck's trailer.

Troopers said the semitruck driver continued down Kaley Avenue unaware that he was even involved in a crash.

""A good Samaritan followed the truck,"" FHP Lt. Kim Montes said. ""Followed him down Kaley when he stopped directed him that he had been involved in a crash.""

Montes said the driver came back within 10 minutes visibly upset and is cooperating with troopers. Charges against the truck driver are pending, she said.

""That wasn't Kevin ... that wasn't him,"" said friend Ismael Ocasio of his friend being taken off life support Friday.

Lopez's death marks the second person killed at the fault of a truck driver in the same week. On Wednesday, 10-year old Kevin Pope was hit and killed by a semitruck while on his way home from Wetherbee Elementary School. The semitruck driver did not stop.

At first, troopers want to give the driver of that truck, who still hasn't been found, the benefit of the doubt of maybe, like in Lopez's case, he didn't know. However, as time goes by authorities say that may change.

""We are into two days after this crash (investigation) now and there has been so much publicity about it -- either the truck driver is not from this area or he is not willing to come forward,"" Montes said.

She also added truck drivers are held to a high standard and have to have a specialized commercial license and have more responsibilities when it comes to being safe on the road.

""There are blind spots in a truck but those drivers are trained to overcome those obstacles and make them a better driver so when we do have crashes with semitrucks, although some can be explained, it doesn't give them excuse,"" Montes said.

Lopez's friends and family hoping to raise awareness for all drivers, especially truck drivers to pay attention and be more careful when behind the wheel.

""I'm just devastated not just because one of them was my friend, but the other was a 10-year-old boy,"" Ocasio said. ""Today it's my friend. Tomorrow it could be someone else and we just don't want that.""

Lopez's sister started a GoFundMe to help his family pay for medical, and now, funeral expenses.

482,Former Miami police officer acquitted in kicking case before it ever went to jury,"MIAMI - A former Miami police officer who was caught on camera trying to kick a handcuffed suspect in the head has been acquitted of wrongdoing before his case even went to a jury.

Miami-Dade County Judge Michael Barket said he had no choice but to end the trial because of a Broward County judge's decision to not allow the alleged victim, David Suazo, to travel to Miami to testify in the trial of Mario Figueroa.

Figueroa was not only fired for the May 3, 2018, incident but he was also charged with misdemeanor assault.

""It was an obvious violation of our policy,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said in May 2018.

Barket said he was forced to clear the officer without the case ever going to a jury, citing a lack of evidence due to the lack of testimony from Suazo.

""My client was denied his right to appear before the court and tell the court his side,"" Suazo's attorney, Rod Vereen, said.

Prosecutors asked Barket for more time to get Suazo to court, but with Broward County Judge Tim Bailey already denying the request to allow Suazo to travel to Miami-Dade County for the trial, Barket said no.

Suazo is currently incarcerated in Broward in connection with a carjacking.

""Somebody fumbled the ball and, as a result, an officer got acquitted of conduct he should not have gotten acquitted of,"" Vereen said.

The incident involving Figueroa and Suazo occurred May 3, 2018, at the Culmer Place Apartments at 610 NW 10th St.

A resident filmed and published the video on Facebook.

According to an arrest report, Suazo was in a blue 2000 Jeep Cherokee that was reported stolen in Broward County when officers ordered him to stop, and he sped away instead. Officers said Suazo crashed into a concrete wall at 835 NW 7th Ave. and took off running.

When an officer first caught up to him, Suazo took a ""fighting stance"" and shouted an expletive, according to the arrest report. The officer deployed his Taser, but officers said ""it was ineffective"" and Suazo continued to run. When police officers caught up to him again, a witness began to film.

The video shows an officer, identified as Figueroa, running into the camera's view and taking a kick at Suazo's head while the suspect was already facedown on the ground and motionless.

Suazo was taken to a hospital after complaining of chest pains and told Figueroa, ""Missed trying to kick. Learn how to aim, my boy.""

""If I wanted to kick you, you know I would have kicked you, right?"" Figueroa replied.

The Miami Fraternal Order of Police stood by Figueroa during the ordeal, with its president saying shortly after the incident that Figueroa did not violate police policy because he never actually kicked the suspect and ""simply gestured to make him comply.""

483,"'Our greatest concern': Youth pastor used immigration threats to rape girl, police say","A former youth pastor is behind bars after police say he sexually assaulted a teenage girl and forced a teenage boy to watch the unthinkable crime.

Pembroke Pines police arrested Luis Clarke, 38, after the victim came forward about the assaults that happened between August 2016 to February 2017, according to an arrest report.

""The level of coercion that this suspect used in order to victimize this young lady is just so egregious, it makes this crime that much more serious,” said Captain Al Xiques of the Pembroke Pines Police Department.

According to the report, the female victim told police Clarke sexually assaulted her about 20 times.

She was between 15 and 16 years old.

In the report, the former youth pastor of the now-closed Abraza Tu Sueño Church picked the teenage girl up from school and took her to his house.

In one instance, police say Clarke activated his home alarm system, so neither of the teens could leave.

""You never know who you're encountering, you never know who you're meeting,” Xiques said.

The teenage girl told police she didn’t report the assaults because Clarke threatened to report her and her families’ illegal status to authorities.

""Our greatest concern is that there are potentially additional victims in the community,"" Xiques said.

The church closed last year.

Police believe there could be more victims.

""We're asking the community, parents and guardians, if you know that your child has come into contact with Mr. Clarke at any point in time in the past, please speak to them and ask them, if at any time, they have has any inappropriate contact with Mr. Clarke,” Xiques said.",http://cw34.com/news/local/our-greatest-concern-youth-pastor-used-immigration-threats-to-rape-girl-police-say,2019-04-26T02:47:30Z,WTVX,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407

A man who shot his live-in girlfriend and her son as she tried to get away from him is now facing murder charges after the child died, according to the Newberry County Sheriff’s Office.X’Zavier Sharif Davis, 26, lived with his girlfriend, two of their children and the girlfriend’s son in a home on Cherry Lane, officials said. Davis and his girlfriend had gotten into a domestic dispute on early Saturday, according to the Sheriff’s Office. Investigators said Davis had come home after midnight and found the door locked. He demanded the woman let him in, but she and the children had gone to bed, investigators said. Sheriff Lee Foster said in a Facebook post that Davis then got into the house and began yelling at the woman and her children. Davis’ girlfriend gathered up her children and left through a back door, Foster said.“As she fled the property, Davis opened fire with a handgun, hitting the car several times,” Foster said.Foster said the woman was hit by the gunfire, and as she was driving to Newberry County Memorial Hospital, she realized her 7-year-old son, Iven James Caldwell, had also been shot.Because of the seriousness of his injuries, Iven was transferred to a Columbia hospital, Foster said.Deputies went to the home on Cherry Lane and found Davis had locked himself inside. After a brief time, deputies said they were able to talk Davis into coming out of the house and took him into custody without incident.Davis was initially charged with four counts of assault and battery with intent to kill.Newberry County Coroner Laura Kneece said Iven died of his injuries Monday afternoon.Foster said one of the charges against Davis will be upgraded to murder. Davis is being held without bond in the Newberry County Detention Center.“As a parent, my heart just aches for the mother and children who had to watch this child be shot and eventually die from this senseless act of violence,” Foster said. “It is simply abhorrent to me that this child’s life was taken because of the willful, senseless and reckless actions of this suspect.”Foster thanked the staff of Newberry County Memorial Hospital for their “heroic and compassionate care of the victims.”He also thanked the staff for their patience because the emergency department had to be treated as a crime scene during the investigation.There was no immediate update on the girlfriend's condition.

Prosecutor Marc DiGiacomo told a judge Tuesday the state won't seek the death penalty against 60-year-old Amy Elizabeth Fleming.

Clark County District Court Judge Douglas Herndon scheduled trial Jan. 6.

Fleming's son, Francillon Pierre, was never found after Fleming and then-fiance Lee Luster reported he wandered away from a swap meet in August 1986.

A detective reviewing evidence in 2017 found letters Fleming wrote to Luster in 1986 appearing to acknowledge the boy was dead, and police say new witness accounts support a murder charge.

490,State closes investigation into death of Jacksonville toddler,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The Florida Department of Children and Families has ruled that inadequate supervision did not contribute to the death of a toddler found unconscious last year at a Jacksonville day care.

The child welfare agency wrapped up its investigation into 15-month-old Malik Baker’s death April 2. It found no evidence of abuse or neglect at the hands of staff at Tip Top 24 Hour Learning Center.

Baker died in September 2018 at Wolfson Children’s Hospital, where he was taken after paramedics discovered the boy unresponsive at the day care facility on Blanding Boulevard.

An autopsy found the child’s cause and manner of death were undetermined. It determined there was no visible trauma to the boy’s body.

The medical examiner concluded that the child’s death was not from choking as was initially thought, based on what caregivers told first responders when they arrived at the facility Sept. 20.

Paramedics called to the day care about 11:15 a.m. that day found the boy lying on a table without a pulse. They were told the child was seen chewing on a toy block, but found his airway was clear.

Baker was taken to the hospital, where he died the next day despite life-saving efforts.

The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office closed its investigation March 19 after ruling the death undetermined. According to the DCF report, there was no further law enforcement action taken in the case.

491,Deputies: 2-year-old drowns in Baker County retention pond,"MACCLENNY, Fla. - A 2-year-old boy pulled from a retention pond off West Minnesota Avenue in Macclenny drowned Tuesday morning, according to Baker County Sheriff Scotty Rhoden.

A post on the Baker County Sheriff's Office Facebook page said the boy, Franklin Parker, was being watched overnight by his 18-year-old older sister while the two were staying with friends. Their parents were at work, deputies said.

The girl told deputies she and Franklin slept together on a couch, but he woke up at 6:50 a.m. and she gave him a toy and a cellphone to play games on. She said the doors were all closed, but the front door was unlocked at the time.

Deputies said the sister was later awakened by neighbors knocking on the door, saying they'd seen Franklin running around outside between 9:40 and 10 a.m.

The girl and the two neighbors searched for the boy, and one of the neighbors found him in the nearby retention pond.

""When I came out to smoke a cigarette I seen the man jump in the water and then I seen him carry the baby out,"" neighbor Gordon Hall said. ""He said the baby was face down in the water.""

Another neighbor began CPR on Franklin until deputies arrived.

Franklin was taken to Ed Fraser Memorial Hospital in Macclenny, where he died.

Trisha Bennett, who lives across from the pond, has two small children and said she was heartbroken by what happened.

""I did not know a pond was over there,"" Bennett said. ""I see people all the time, riding four-wheelers all the time over there. I did not necessarily know there was a pond over there.""

News4Jax is working to learn more, including why the retention pond across from a small apartment complex is not fenced.

A check with the St. Johns Water Management District showed the pond, which is under construction as part of a storage unit lot, was permitted. The owner told News4Jax a fence is planned but hasn't been built yet.

The owner was devastated Tuesday but declined an interview.

The Department of Children and Families was notified and is investigating the boy's death.

""Sheriff Scotty Rhoden asks the community for continued prayers for the family and friends of the deceased, as well as the Law Enforcement Officers involved in the investigation,"" the Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook.

Country music star Kelsea Ballerini is unapologetically herself, even while performing her first arena-headlining tour at the sold-out Hertz Arena on Thursday night.

Wearing a fiery red outfit with knee-high boots and an equally high ponytail, the 25-year-old Knoxville native commanded attention when she first hit the stage with her girl power anthem ""Miss Me More.""

""I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings

Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you

Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more (I miss me more)""

Country-pop singer, Kelsea Ballerini brought her first arena-headlining tour ""Miss Me More"" to Hertz Arena in Estero, FL, April 25, 2019. The concert was sold out. (Photo: Staff Photo by Andrea Melendez)

The hit song also happens to be the name of Ballerini's 14-city tour, which kicked off April 11 in Maryland and features two Florida stops, including St. Augustine.

Coming up at Hertz: ZZ Top to play at Hertz Arena for 50th anniversary tour with Cheap Trick. Tickets on sale this week.

Ballerini was joined by country newcomer Brandon Ratcliff, who performed a 15-minute set, and Brett Young, who had nearly every female concertgoer swooning as he sung his No. 1 single on Billboard's Country Airplay chart, ""Here Tonight.""

Young, who's from California, had the crowd going for nearly an hour with his Cali-country hits, and it seemed as though concertgoers couldn't possibly get more excited until Ballerini took to the stage.

She sang several tracks from her latest album “Unapologetically,” including her cheeky “Get Over Yourself” and her more reflective tracks “Machine Heart” and “Legends.” She also performed songs off her first album ""The First Time,"" including “Dibs,” “Love Me Like You Mean It” and “Peter Pan.” She closed the show with a high-energy performance of “This Feeling,” a mainstream pop song she and The Chainsmokers collaborated on.

Hot off her sophomore album ""Unapologetically,"" to say Ballerini's musical career is on fire is an understatement. She was recently inducted as the newest and youngest current member of the Grand Ole Opry by one of country's leading ladies, Carrie Underwood.

In between songs, Ballerini spoke from the heart, sharing intimate stories behind ""Unapologetically,"" which she said she recorded while she was going through her first real breakup and growing into her own as a woman. She also shared how excited she was to receive the honor from the Grand Ole Opry earlier this month.

""It's the peak of life,"" she told the crowd, then joking that it could only go downhill from here. ""It was the biggest honor of all time.""

Ballerini, now a two-time Grammy nominated artist, moved to Nashville with her mom when she was only 15 to pursue a music career. She dedicated ""In Between,"" a song off her latest album, to her mom, who was in the crowd Thursday night for the three-hour show, along with Ballerini's Australian singer-songwriter hubby Morgan Evans.

But it was the fans Ballerini kept coming back to.

""Thank you for making a 15-year-old girl's wish come true,"" she told concertgoers before stepping off the stage and walking around the arena to take selfies and shake hands with fans while singing her hit song ""Love Me Like You Mean It.""

Ballerini is a force to be reckoned with not just in country radio but the music industry in general. In the past she's opened for some of country's biggest acts like Alan Jackson, Lady Antebellum, Tim McGraw, Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban. Now that she finally has her own tour she can show off how versatile she is as an artist. She can go from country to pop and isn't afraid to cross genres.

And she also isn't afraid to strap on a guitar or play the drums when the occasion arises. She was completely in her element when it was just her and the mic. A couple of times she took a break from skipping around the stage to autograph posters all while still singing.

She's definitely on her way and while there's no telling what Ballerini will do next, one thing is for certain: She won't apologize for being herself.

Of course you'll walk away from ""And the World Goes 'Round"" at TheatreZone humming your favorite John Kander-Fred Ebb tunes. But the ones you don't know steal the show.

The five singers-dancers-actors do a hilarious diatribe to life on the treadmill with ""Coffee in a Cardboard Cup,"" adding jitters and speed as they gulp and the song flies on. While you may not be singing ""Yes"" on the way home, it's a sunny spirit lift, with a bouyant beat to match its chipper lyrics:

There's lots of chaff, there's lots of wheat

You might get mugged as you walk the streets

But on the other hand you might reach

That handsome stranger you've longed to meet

Both of the above songs are from a long-forgotten musical for which the two wrote music, ""70 Girls 70."" For every ""Chicago"" and Cabaret"" — both works with the Kander and Ebb team behind them — there are another handful of musicals that didn't make it, with some of the team's great music on the shelf with them.

""And the World Goes 'Round,"" the musical revue of their works, dusts them off and splices in some of their outside works for an engaging music marathon.

And there's always room for a tap dance, featuring Kayley Stevens and Charles Logan romping nimbly around stage. (Learn to tap dance, guys; that clicky cavort-athon changes the outcome of Logan's plaintive ""Marry Me"" proposal to Stevens.)

Each of the five in this production was chosen for a special skill; one may sing better, but precision timing and comic touch may be the forte for another. While Broadway veteran Patrick Sullivan may deliver a suitably menacing ""Kiss of the Spider Woman,"" he's fracturing as the toned, tanned, Ray-banned boy toy of ""Arthur in the Afternoon.""

All of them can sell the song, but they have to work to match Carolann Sanitas' vamp of ""How Lucky Can You Get,"" a tune from the long-gone ""Funny Lady"" sequel to ""Funny Girl."" (For the record, the hit ""Funny Girl"" was a Jule Styne-Bob Merrill collaboration, so you won't hear ""People"" here.)

Sanitas and Laura Hodos also ham up ""Class,"" from ""Chicago,"" playing a pair of low-lifes sniffing at others' manners. They reprise as a pair for ""What's So Wonderful,"" a movie star and a housewife wryly comparing lives.

Only Logan can match them in the silly, slightly suggestive cabaret paeon to ""Sara Lee,"" effusing over every product in the freezer:

And it thrills me right to my soul

When I'm chewin' your finger roll

And I'm cryin' ""For goodness sake

There never been a better banana cake""

And he lusts to taste her cherry Danish, too, so we're pretty sure this one didn't show up in TV commercials.

Logan does another comic turn with a ""Chicago"" tune as the sad sack ""Mr. Cellophane,"" a dweeb who can't even get the spotlight to stay on him as he moves.

The evening has its share of poignant moments, such as Sullivan's wistful ""I Don't Remember You"" from a musical titled ""The Happy Time."" He does its title tune as well; Hodos offers a hopeful ""Maybe This Time"" from ""Cabaret"" and Stevens meditates on love as ""A Quiet Thing"" (from ""Flora, the Red Menace"").

Karen Molnar's choreography takes advantage of the G&L Theatre's small stage with circular routines and visuals, such as a black light segment in ""New York, New York""; the troupe dons white top hats, gloves and spats for a visual treat on the darkened stage. She even puts the troupe on roller skates for breathtaking zips around ""The Rink,"" title tune to that musical.

This show employs lighting cleverly, embedding lights in the singers' hats to give their faces a glow for the dark tune ""Money, Money"" (from the movie version of ""Cabaret"").

And the troupe outdoes itself in a jazzed, Manhattan Transfer harmony take on the title tune from ""Cabaret,"" backed by Charles Fornara and a top-flight band whose arrangements — save for a strangely waltzy ""My Coloring Book"" — seal the evening.

It's a happy way for TheatreZone, and audiences, to close the 2018-19 season.

509,Tyler Florence and 'The Great Food Truck Race' rolled through Fort Myers — here's the aftermath,"CLOSE Tyler Florence and the 'Great Food Truck Race' in Fort Myers Andrew West, News-Press

Food Network's ""The Great Food Truck Race"" and chef-host Tyler Florence spent a whirlwind 48 hours in Fort Myers. It was crazy. Let's recap.

The calls and messages started coming Monday night.

Several out-of-town food trucks, all with little history and not much of a social-media following, reached out to local breweries, venues and other area food trucks hoping to secure last-minute spots at their sites.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

""We got a voicemail and an Instagram message from a couple of the trucks Monday,"" said Jen Gratz-Whyte, owner of Fort Myers Brewing Co. in Gateway.

""I was like: We book food trucks weeks in advance, who do these people think they are?""

Competitors on ""The Great Food Truck Race,"" that's who.

The Food Network reality competition rolled through the Fort Myers area Wednesday and Thursday, drawing legions of fans and interested food lovers to downtown Fort Myers, Fort Myers Brewing, Millennial Brewing and Old Soul Brewing during a whirlwind 48 hours of production and reality-show theatrics.

The show also brought its host, celebrity chef Tyler Florence, to town. The Food Network star checked in with his contestants — and with local restaurants.

""I'm all about craft,"" Florence said.

""This show takes me all over the country and I love finding those little, out-of-the-way places that truly celebrate the craft of food.""

Florence made stops at Bennett's Fresh Roast in Fort Myers, Dixie Fish Co. on Fort Myers Beach and Rosy Tomorrows Heritage Farm in North Fort Myers. The first two will be featured in a digital special Florence is shooting in conjunction with ""The Great Food Truck Race.""

His visit to Rosy's came at the behest of a certain food writer (ahem), who thought the chef might enjoy the farm-restaurant's unique approach.

""This is incredible,"" Florence said after tasting Rosy Tomorrows' turmeric-pickled eggs, its mangrove salt, its ice cream churned from milk squeezed from Brie, the Jersey dairy cow out back who Florence had fed just moments earlier.

""This is Michelin-level stuff happening out here. This is crazy.""

Almost as crazy as leading a band of food trucks up and down the East Coast of the U.S. for a few months.

The past two days' events will be featured in season 10 of ""The Great Food Truck Race,"" which Florence and executive producer Jeffrey L. Weaver said should air in August.

The show pits food trucks against each other, with $50,000 in prize money at stake for the winner. In each new city, the trucks vie for sales. Each truck starts with the same budget for ingredients. The truck that nets the lowest profit is sent packing at the end of each episode.

The reality of this reality show became apparent Wednesday.

After the mob scene that was Fort Myers Brewing Co., where a trio of the show's trucks had set up for the afternoon, Florence headed to Madea Made, a barbecue and Southern comfort-food truck that had parked alongside Jonesez BBQ at the corner of Crystal Drive and Metro Parkway in south Fort Myers.

Madea's quiet, dusty lot stood in stark contrast to the throngs of people at the brewery in Gateway.

""This is the competition,"" Florence said.

""These guys choose the venues themselves. They make these decisions on their own. Madea chose to tag along with Jonesez, which has an amazing reputation in the area, but this is not the scene we saw at the brewery, that's for sure.""

Back at Fort Myers Brewing, Fort Myers resident Les Butler was first in (a very long) line for NOLA Creations 504, a Cajun-Creole truck offering po' boys, beignets and gator jambalaya.

Butler placed his order and then waited a solid 15 minutes for his $12 shrimp po' boy with Cajun rice to be delivered.

""Delicious,"" he said, smiling.

Butler and his wife, Mary, got to Fort Myers Brewing at 1 p.m. Wednesday. The trucks were supposed to start serving at 2 p.m., but due to ""competitiony things,"" as Gratz-Whyte put it, they didn't open their windows till almost 4 p.m.

""We've just been hanging out, sipping beers,"" Butler said. ""No complaints here.""

That same vibe permeated Old Soul Brewing in Fort Myers, where patrons waited Wednesday for the Frank n Slides truck. Erin Croop of Cape Coral sipped a pineapple kombucha on a late lunch break as the first scents of bacon and sizzling meat filled Old Soul's parking lot.

""I'm just a food lover,"" Croop said. ""I had to come and see what this was all about.""

Late Thursday morning the show shifted gears to downtown Fort Myers, where the trucks competed in a head-to-head challenge on First Street. At noon, some of the trucks dispersed, including Rolling Indulgence, a 1950s-style diner truck that headed to nearby Millennial Brewing.

""We had no idea what to expect,"" Millennial's owner Kyle Cebull said. ""We always host food trucks, but this was another level of drama and intrigue.""

Florence said the show will continue rolling through South Florida in the coming weeks, though he couldn't pinpoint where exactly.

As for the love Fort Myers showed him and his contestants, Florence seemed genuinely blown away.

""This is our 10th season, 10 seasons of me chasing taco trucks all around the country,"" he said, ""and I've never seen anything quite like this.

""Fort Myers rolled out the red carpet for us. It's been a great time.""

510,"Former gang member who shot, killed 9-year-old granted new sentence","- Stacy Williams will never forget May 21, 2007.

""Were you present when your son, Stacy was killed?"" Assistant State attorney Art Brown asked Stacy Williams, Sr. in court Tuesday.

He replied, ""Yes.”

His 9-year-old son, Stacy Williams, Jr. was riding his bike in Samoset, Florida when a car pulled up. In the back seat was 15-year-old Orlando Valenzuela.

Valenzuela, a gang member, armed himself with a gun and fired shots at a rival gang member. He missed his target and hit little Stacy twice, killing him.

Continue reading below

Valenzuela was sentenced to life without parole in 2008., but a Supreme Court ruling allowed him to be resentenced.

On Thursday morning, Stacy Williams' father asked that Valenzuela remains behind bars for life.

""Can you tell the court what you would think would be an appropriate sentence in this case?"" asked Brown.

Williams replied, ""Life on life. That’s all I see.”

His defense attorney argued Valenzuela grew up without a father and faced many challenges as a child. Those challenges led him to gang life.

An expert witness testified that Valenzuela found acceptance, for the first time, from the gang.

""Adolescents, by virtue of their brain development, are more focused on 'Why should I? What is a reward outcome of their behavior?'"" explained Dr. Kraim Yamout.

Valenzuela's older brother also testified. He was once a gang member himself, but with help, he turned his life around.

""All that kid stuff is in the past. Do I want to go back? No. I just hope in your heart that you give him a second chance,"" said Alberto Valenzuela.

Orlando Valenzuela spoke, apologizing to Stacy's family.

""If I had the power to trade my life for Stacy's, believe me, I would. I would rather you be happy than me live with guilt for killing your son,"" he said.

Judge Riva re-sentenced Valenzuela to 40 years in prison followed by 10 years of probation.

He will be eligible for parole after 25 years, but with time served, he could be eligible for parole in 14 years.

Stacy's family said their little boy never even had a chance to experience life and Valenzuela's bad decision shattered their life.

""He knew what he was doing when he got that gun. Meant to hurt somebody. It just meant to be my grandson,"" said his grandfather Michael Battie.",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/former-gang-member-who-shot-killed-9-year-old-granted-new-sentence,2019-04-25T23:41:54Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - It was the sound Jessica Purcell had been waiting to hear, on a day she's wanted for so long.

A ringing bell.

In fact, when the moment finally arrived Monday, it overwhelmed her at first .

The St. Petersburg mom was at a loss for words, left speechles. She knew exactly what it meant.

No more chemo.

Monday marked a major miletstone for Jessica. It was her final chemotherapy treament at Moffitt Cancer Center in in Tampa after fighting a non-stop, grueling battle.

What happend next shattered her heart, leaving her terrified every day of her pregnancy.

If she wanted to see her son born and be there as her 21-month-old little girl grew up, doctors recommended chemotherapy. They also probvided a chilling prediction if she opted out of chemo.

Jessica knew this was a time for power, fueled bypositivity.

Her spirit was strong as she relied on faith, family, mental toughness and most of all - a good attitude.

I've got this, God's got this, I will beat this, she'd tell herself while sitting through twelve rounds of chemo. I've got this, my little guy in my belly will be just fine, we've got this.

She did.

In March, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy, marking down the days until her final treatment, knowing what was waiting at the finsih line .

The chemo bell, which rang out Monday afternoon, a tradition carried out all oer the country at hospitals and canccer centers. Jessica will soon begin daily radiation, and she knows exactly when it will end.

She also knows what she''ll do on that day - she'll ring the bell again.

She's aleady counting down the days til mid-summer when she completes tjhe treatment. And, on that final day of treatment - the sound of victory.

She'll ring the bell..

Some call it the most beautiful sound in the world.

Jessica calls it music to her ears

Jessica Purcell is one tough mama.

She's a captain in the United States Army. She's served overseas on mutiple deployments in places like Afghanistan and Qatar.

She's faced dangerous situations before. But, it was her battle here at home with breast cancer where she found herself fighting for her life and the life of her newborn son.

""I just knew ultimately, this is God's will, God's way. Somehow, some way, it will, we can do this,"" she said, cradling her 5-week-old baby boy. He is her miracle.

When Jessica was 9-weeks pregnant, doctors gave her devastating news. She was diagnosed with breast cancer.

For this St.Petersburg mom who served in the military, perserverance and positivity became her ammo in battling the disease. ""We got this, somehow it's going to work out,"" she said with a sigh and a smile. ""Just keep the faith. Keep your hope. It's so mental.""

Jessica would need that mental strength and toughness as she endured a mastectomy and 12 rounds of grueling chemotherapy, all while pregnant.

At the same time, she and her husband were also raising their little girl, nearly two years-old. ""Just going through chemo alone is hard, being pregnant is hard. But, going through both, I just, you would never imagine doing that,"" she told us.

She explained how terrfiying it was to face chemotherapy while carrying her son. She says she sought multiple opinions from top oncologists all over the country and coupled their findings with extensive research she performed on her own.

She says she was told if she didn't seek chemotherapy treatment, she would most likely not survive to see her son or raise her daughter. She recalled the fear and crippling anxiety she felt wondering what her future held.

Jessica relied on her faith, friends, family and support groups comprised of other moms going through similar circumstances.

Then, came the joyous moment. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy in March.

But, because she couldn't breastfeed, Jessica wanted to give her little guy a boost to his immune system. A jump-start for baby Jameson.

So, she posted a plea on Facebook for breast milk.

""I'm like, 'Oh my goodness,'"" Jessica told us with a wide grin. ""This is, you know I mean. I have offers coming from around the world now, just to ship from other countires. I literally thought just the girls in St. Pete, maybe Tampa, would be a stretch.""

The mother of two says she's still in shock that her goal went global.

For now, she's focusing on feeding her son with donated breast milk from local moms and familiar faces. She says some moms have paid for extensive bloodwork when offering their milk, while others are close friends in which she has a history.

""It's wonderful, it's overwhelming. My freezer is full, I can actually feed my little guy,"" she said.

Jessica says she's pleasantly overwhelmed with the love and support she's received worldwide. It has warmed her heart and strengthened her mama bear spirit.

""I'm more excited than anything, I'm just so blessed,"" she told us. ""My little guy, he's here, just a breath of fresh air.""

Jessica has one more final chemo treatment, then she will soon begin radiation. She says her nurses at Moffitt Cancer Center keep her going, as does her moms' group.

515,"Juveniles accused of stealing gun from vehicle, trading it for marijuana","MOUNT DORA, Fla. - Two middle school students are accused of stealing a gun from a parked vehicle then trading it for marijuana, according to the Mount Dora Police Department.

The vehicle burglary happened at a Lowe's parking lot on Dec. 6, 2018. The victim said he left his Glock underneath a backpack on the passenger's seat of his Ford Mustang and he returned hours later to find it and $40 stolen, according to the report.

On April 11, a parent who monitors her child's social media accounts notified a resource officer at Mount Dora Middle School that she had seen pictures on Snapchat showing two male students with a gun and what appeared to be marijuana, the affidavit said.

Police said the date on the photo indicated that it was taken around the same time of the vehicle burglary and the gun had the same specifications as the one that was stolen.

Both boys admitted that they stole the gun from a vehicle parked at Lowe's and exchanged it for marijuana, according to the report.

One boy was arrested April 12 and the other was arrested on Monday.

The boys face charges of armed burglary of a conveyance, use of a firearm during a felony and grand theft of a firearm.

517,Officers surprise birthday boy ‘obsessed’ with police,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

CHESTERFIELD COUNTY, Va. – Two police officers made a Chesterfield boy’s birthday wish come true thanks to an epic surprise on Easter.

Gabriel Valenzuela called the police station hoping an officer might be able to stop by to surprise his friend's police-obsessed son, Mason Sanchez, for his birthday.

Valenzuela was told the department would do their best to send an officer that afternoon, according to WTVR.

When Officer Gonzalez and Wells showed up at the family's home, Valenzuela was elated, but said the boy's family had no idea what he had arranged.

In a video posted to Facebook, the family keeps the birthday boy and his friends waiting in the hall and then tells him to come out for a surprise.

“They came for your birthday,” Lorena Rodriguez, Mason's mom, says as the boy runs through the front door.

The boy runs into the arms of Officer Gonzalez before running to hug Officer Wells.

“Happy Birthday,” Officer Wells says.

“They came to wish you a happy birthday, Mas!” his mom says.

As the boy sees the police cruiser parked in the family’s driveway, he jumps up and down.

“How old are you now?” Officer Gonzalez asks.

“Five,” Mason replies, pointing to his no. 5 police badge-emblazoned t-shirt.

“High five for turning five,” Officer Gonzalez replies.

Mason started “admiring everything about police officers” over the past year, according to Valenzuela said.

In fact, he dressed up as an officer for Halloween last year.

“He calls them his fellow brothers and he can’t wait to grow up to be like one of them,” Valenzuela said.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/04/22/officers-surprise-birthday-boy-obsessed-with-police/,2019-04-22T14:04:32Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394

519,Florida Navy vet tells of making history in WWII,"ORMOND BEACH -- An old photo rests atop a table in Clint Lake’s Ormond Beach, Fla., home. In it, he’s young, handsome, and ready to take on the world.

And he did.

Lake had hair then and wasn’t bent or hard of hearing as he is now at 93. And though he can’t seem to find his medals, the World War II Navy veteran’s memory remains sharp.

As a dive bomber radioman and gunner aboard the USS Intrepid, an aircraft carrier whose role in the war was so integral it has its own museum, Lake took part in 19 missions — most before he turned 19. By the time the war was through, Lake had ditched his plane in the ocean, survived a kamikaze attack, and helped destroy the Yamato, an “unsinkable” Japanese battleship.

Lake’s story grows more precious with time. Of the 16 million Americans who served in the war, fewer than 500,000 remain.

“It’s kind of scary,” Lake said. “Sometimes I stop and think about it and say, ‘Gee whiz, where is everybody?’”

Lake’s role in the Allied mission to take Okinawa placed him at a historical milestone, and recently officials from the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum came to Ormond Beach to interview him for their oral history project.

“There’s certain things that we can never discover through reading archives and reading books,” said Jessica Williams, museum curator of history and collections. “These are things that really can only be brought to life by speaking with people who experienced it directly.”

Okinawa

Wanting to avoid the grunt work of the Army he feared was about draft him, Lake joined the Navy at 17 on Aug. 2, 1943. After radioman and gunnery training, the Miami Florida native was sent to his new home, a ship so massive its crew numbered in the thousands.

“It was enormous. I had never seen anything that big before,” Lake said of the Intrepid. “We drove up there in a bus and we all kind of gaped, ‘I ain’t gonna ride in that thing.’”

Embarking from Pearl Harbor toward the Pacific theater, Lake’s first mission was to attack Kure, a Japanese naval harbor home to, among other things, the Yamato — a battleship so strong it was whispered to be unsinkable.

Lake’s job on the on the two-man SB2C Helldiver dive bomber was to operate the radio, radar, and two 30-caliber machine guns. He did this while facing backwards, and the view, for better or worse, didn’t allow Lake to see what was in front of him. By design, dive bombers flew high before quickly plunging toward their target and dropping their bombs, meaning they had to get fairly close to the enemy.

Though Lake’s was among hundreds of planes dispatched to attack Kure, Allied forces weren’t able to sink the enemy warships, leaving the Yamato free to lurk seas and Lake to face her another day.

From Kure, the Intrepid headed to Okinawa where it fought in the war’s last major battle. The plan was to take the airbase there and mount a final campaign on the Japanese home islands.

On Easter Sunday, as part of the colossal force assembled, Lake attacked the island, providing fire so that U.S. forces could storm it.

Records show Okinawa was fortified with more than 100,000 Japanese, many dug in further inland waiting to entrap U.S. forces. While the initial Japanese counterattack was muted, it was Lake’s first experience with being shot at or “walking on flak.”

“You could feel the concussion of the flak exploding by you,” Lake said of the way near-misses from anti-aircraft fire rocked the plane.

But there was too much going on to be frightened, Lake said. And soon, he would be on another mission.

Hunt for the Yamato

Having come to know the Yamato’s menacing reputation first-hand, Lake knew he would be in for a fight. As the lead battleship for Japan’s Imperial Navy, the ship was big, armored, and loaded with a daunting array of more than 200 guns.

Despite the Yamato’s prowess, because of a fuel shortage it was ordered to beach itself at Okinawa and fight until destroyed. If the ship made landfall, its heavy armament and troops — determined to die for their homeland — could wreak havoc for Allied forces already on the island.

“They were going to do what damage they could,” Lake said. “It was kind of a suicide mission and they were going to run this battleship up on land and give the sailors some rifles and say goodbye.”

Fortunately, Allied forces decoded Japan’s battle plans and U.S. submarines spotted the Yamato before it made landfall. With this, on April 7, Lake and hundreds of others were ordered to dispatch the monster ship.

A dot in the vast Pacific, the Yamato remained elusive until new coordinates were given, ones that Lake said placed him directly in the ship’s crosshairs.

“We were flying along at about 4,000 feet and someone on the radio said, ‘If you turn right you’ll run right into the big boy,’” Lake said. “We turned right and boom! The ship fired at us.”

As Allied planes swarmed overhead, the Yamato unleashed hell, lighting up the skies with antiaircraft fire. Undaunted, Lake’s plane dove, swooping down to bomb the ship.

While Lake returned to the Intrepid, records show that after a relentless Allied attack, the Yamato hung listless in the sea before capsizing. She exploded before finally plunging into the Pacific’s dark waters.

The myth was no more.

Japan’s revenge

The war was not yet over and before Lake would return home, the empire of the rising sun would have its revenge.

On April 16, just 11 days after sinking the Yamato, Lake was below deck filling up his cigarette lighter when the Japanese attacked the Intrepid as it was patrolling the waters near Okinawa. He felt the ship vibrate. Alarms sounded.

“A kamikaze, one of their death planes, attacked us and hit the deck,” Lake said.

The aircraft fired on the ship before crashing through its flight deck, the force propelling the plane clear down into the hangar deck below. A museum excerpt of gunnery officer Lt. Commander William Lindenberger’s journal tells of his up-close encounter of the attack.

“We knew he was a 'Kami-Kazi' and knew he would fly his plane into us unless we exploded him in mid-air. All the ships guns pumped shells into him but he kept coming down. Pieces of his wing broke off but he didn’t swerve from his course,” Lindenberger wrote. “I had the feeling that he couldn’t possibly miss me. Everyone feels that way when a plane is bearing down on him.”

“He passed over my head out of view, our gun ceased firing just before a terrific jar shook the whole ship,” he wrote. “Then an explosion resounded through the decks, followed by two distinct shuddering vibrations. It felt as if some giant sledge hammer had fallen with all its force.”

SEE THE ATTACK HERE: Kamikaze suicide plane attacks USS Intrepid (CV-11) - 16 April 1945

With the flight deck ablaze, the ship was locked down as crews worked to put the fire out, Lake said.

All Lake could do was wait and hope.

While he was unharmed in the attack, others weren’t so lucky. Reports show that nine men perished.

The Intrepid, which during the war was struck by a torpedo and survived four kamikaze attacks, was called the “Dry I” because it spent so much time being repaired in dry docks. After the April 16 attack, the ship headed back to the U.S. Most of its crew was ditched at Saipan where they waited until being picked up by another ship.

And in an instant, the war was over.

Like many who served, Lake lost friends but said the cause was worth it. Making a choking motion with his hands, Lake said, “I would’ve liked to have gotten a hold of Hitler myself.”

After the war

Once back in Florida, Lake attended Stetson University, performing as a cheerleader and majoring in teaching. He wound up in banking and worked in DeLand before moving to Ormond Beach and working for what was then known as First Atlantic Bank for 23 years.

After his wife passed away in 1974, Lake married his current wife, Nan, who also was widowed. He has two adopted children from his first marriage and is a stepfather to Nan Lake’s four children.

For his service, Lake was awarded two air medals and a gold star.

“I often wondered what would’ve happened to me if there hadn’t had been a war,” he said.

Then he wouldn’t have his story, one that Williams said was important and worth preserving.

“There will be a time when there will be no surviving crew members of the Intrepid. We treat these stories the same way we treat our uniforms and our gear and our photograph collection,” Williams said. “Our goal is to ensure they last into the future as long as the Intrepid exists or beyond even ... so they will be available for future generations to learn from and ask questions about and think about.”

Glancing at the 75-year-old photo sitting atop the table, Lake downplayed the notion that he helped shape history.

“I didn’t do anything,” he said.

TAMPA (WFLA) - Two teens are being called heroes after they rescued two children from rip currents while on Spring Break.

Alex Byrd, 16, and Tyler Brueck,17 were enjoying their spring break at Melbourne Beach ahead of their lacrosse camp in Port St.Lucie.

While boogie boarding the boys heard screams according to Alex's father David. The teens heard another child yelling ""help me"" and sprung into action hoping to rescue a young boy and girl approximately 6 and 8 years old.

The boys were able to pull the two children out of a rip current and carry them to shore. Both kids were shaken up according to Alex's Father but were both conscious.

A lifeguard was able to meet up with the teens and children on the beach soon after they were out of the water. The mother of the two children was tearful as she thanked and hugged Alex and Tyler. The family left the beach soon after, however, the teens never got their names or where they were from.

When asked if the boys consider themselves heroes Alex Byrd told WFLA ""not really, anyone would have tried to help them in that situation.""",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/teen-spring-breakers-rescue-children-from-rip-current-in-florida/1904552548,2019-04-06T15:46:51Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
521,Texas boy missing 2 years found in Central Florida with dad,"SANFORD, Fla. - A 9-year-old Texas boy missing for more than since 2017 was found safe Saturday in Florida with his father.

Sanford police say Joshua Graham was taken from Texas by his father. Authorities say 52-year-old Kenneth Graham did not have custody of his son and did not tell the boy’s mother he was taking him.

According to authorities, they located the father and son while investigating a suspicious vehicle.

“That was one of the most happiest days of my life. That was a call that I never thought would come,"" Yolanda Graham said of when authorities located her son, Joshua.

The child had been reported missing earlier this week. Police did not say why he was not reported sooner. The boy is under the care of child welfare officials until he can be reunited with his mother.

Yolanda Graham told WKMG-TV in Orlando she and her husband were separated on Sept. 26, 2017, when she came home to find a note that read, ""Gone to visit grandparents out of state.""

It was assumed that Kenneth Graham was going to take Joshua to Tallahassee, where his parents lived, but Yolanda Graham later learned that her husband was kicked out of his parents' home in December 2017 and that he Joshua were homeless and living in the Sanford area.

Texas law enforcement in Houston listed Joshua as missing this month with the status of ""abducted by a non-custodial parent.""

''Regardless of the circumstances, the feelings of loss and devastation are indescribable when any child is taken from a parent. The officers and investigators involved in this case are delighted to have played a significant role in reuniting this mother with her child after two long years. I am proud that the officers responding to this call quickly identified that something didn't seem right, and those instincts led to this happy conclusion,"" Sanford Police Chief Cecil Smith said.

According to police, Joshua is in the custody of Child Protective Services while he waits to be reunited with his mother. Yolanda Graham, her two daughters and her son-in-law, are driving to Sanford from Houston to pick up Joshua.

Officials said the state of Texas may file criminal charges at a later date.

527,"A wealthy developer, a local actress, a failed hotel project and an indecent proposal","Palm Beach actress Mia Matthews is busy these days rehearsing in New York City for the upcoming off-Broadway premiere of “After,"" a play about the consequences of a bullying text message.

Off stage, she’s immersed in another emotional production involving texts, this one a bizarre personal drama with one of her biggest admirers — Palm Beach Polo President Glenn Straub.

It’s a drama with salacious allegations detailed in court records, including one ripped from a Hollywood script: In what amounted to an indecent proposal, Straub, who has known Matthews and her husband, Robert “Bob” Matthews, for 20 years, is alleged to have said he let a $27 million mortgage go unpaid “every time Bob let him sleep with Mia.""

Straub denied making any such proposal, although he has engaged in business deals with the Matthewses over the years, including a last-minute loan that saved their Nantucket summer home from foreclosure in 2010.

But he admits sending Mia flirtatious text messages last year, sometimes as a joke, including one with a reference to oral sex. He also bought her earrings, took her to a Broadway show, offered to pay her daughter's tuition, gave loaner cars to the family and provided $300,000 to help Mia and Bob hire criminal lawyers, according to court records.

Those apparent extensions of generosity came at a time when Mia and her husband were desperate and vulnerable: They had been targeted and later charged in a federal fraud investigation into a failed Palm Beach hotel project.

Prosecutors were building a case that Bob, Mia and others had misused millions of dollars that was supposed to be spent to renovate the Palm House Hotel, court records show. The money had been pledged through a federal program by foreign investors seeking green cards.

Bob and Mia are accused of spending some of that money on mortgage and tax payments for their homes and lavish indulgences, such as a yacht, luxury cars and a Paris vacation on a private plane, according to prosecutors.

Bob was among four men, including his brother, arrested in March on multiple fraud charges. As the Palm House scandal swirled in the months before Mia’s arrest in August on a single count of tax evasion, Straub pursued her for an intimate relationship and told her to leave her husband, according to text messages described in court records and a provocative legal argument targeting Straub.

But when Mia refused his advances, he sued her and Bob demanding they return the money he said he loaned them for their lawyers. He also filed a separate lawsuit against the Connecticut law firm representing Bob Matthews, demanding the return of the $150,000 retainer Palm Beach Polo had wired in May.

Mia is not the first female friend Straub has taken to court. Since 2013, five former girlfriends, all significantly younger than Straub, have been sued by his companies over alleged broken debts, The Palm Beach Post reported in November. Two of those women said the lawsuits are frivolous and accused Straub of suing only because they broke up with him.

Although Mia never accused Straub in court records of suing for romantic revenge, lawyers in a Palm House bankruptcy case say he filed the lawsuit just days after she rebuffed his advances.

In court records, Mia said $150,000 of the money “was not a loan but was instead a gift” provided by Straub “without expectation of repayment."" Similar claims were made by other women who have been sued by him.

Straub dismissed the lawsuit against Bob and Mia on Jan. 28 after he said they “paid a good chunk of it back,"" he told The Post. His lawsuit against Bob Matthews’ criminal law firm was settled in December, a few weeks after a Connecticut judicial panel dismissed a professional grievance that Straub had filed against the firm.

Straub, 72, denies having ever been anything more than just a “close friend” to Mia, 52.

In August, he offered a different take on Mia to an FBI agent. Straub considered Mia “an instigator” who drove her husband ""to the ‘high life'” and Bob “'a ‘salesman’ who used ‘every tactic’ to keep Mia happy in the lifestyle,"" according to an FBI memo shown during a Palm House bankruptcy trial.

Bob, 61, and Mia, who each pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges, both declined to comment for this story. Mia referred questions to her attorney, Brian Spears of Connecticut, who declined to comment.

Bob and Mia certainly were aware of Straub’s litigious history — they’d been sued by him at least once before, in 2010 over the Nantucket loan. But with the Palm House scandal engulfing them, they had no other choice but to lean on the wealthy businessman for help.

“(I)f you look at Wikipedia under Glenn Straub it says most litigious person in South Florida,"" Bob Matthews said at a Securities and Exchange Commission hearing in January 2017.

“I mean, Glenn loves to have coffee with you in the morning, sue you in the afternoon and play tennis with you in the evening. He has this thing where it’s fun. He loves going to court.""

‘Famous signer’ in the USA

Mia’s smiling face once briefly adorned an electronic billboard in Times Square, an image used in a Palm House promotional brochure sent a few years ago to potential investors in China, Iran and Turkey.

The brochures claimed, erroneously, according to federal prosecutors, that former President Bill Clinton, singer Tony Bennett and other celebrities had pledged to be members of the Palm House Club “due in part to the fame of Mia Matthews, the developer Robert Matthews’ wife. Mia Matthews is a famous signer"" — the word “singer” is misspelled — “and entertainer in the USA.""

How famous? That’s up for interpretation. But by most accounts, Mia has enjoyed a modestly successful career.

She had an uncredited appearance as a bartender in a 1997 episode of Michael J. Fox’s “Spin City” and she enjoyed a 52-episode run playing a witch called Desdemona in Nickelodeon’s “Every Witch Way” in 2014-15.

Her website mentions films, brief television roles on a Fox’s “13 Bourbon Street” and the short-lived Hulu series “South Beach,” along with appearances on David Letterman and in TV commercials for Old Navy and the Florida Lottery.

She won a regional acting award for her performance in 2016 in a Miami play, and she can be seen in YouTube clips singing and cartwheeling in “The Bombshell Show,” in which she portrays iconic singers.

Straub said he has attended some of Mia’s performances. Watching her cartwheel across the stage during “The Bombshell Show” a few years ago made an impression on the wealthy developer.

“I knew of her because she was an actress and I’d seen her at different events and she’d do that cartwheel,"" Straub, who has been divorced since 2009, said in a deposition. Her “claim to fame is that she does a cartwheel, a perfect cartwheel, on stage.""

Since Mia married Bob in 1997, she enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle with homes in Palm Beach, Nantucket and Connecticut. In recent years, they were members of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a Lago Club, the Breakers and the Kravis Center, and Mia drove luxury cars such as an Aston Martin, Maserati and Mercedes Hummer, according to statements her husband’s bookkeeper gave to SEC investigators in 2016.

Photos of Mia and Bob on Nantucket with the Clintons, actor Alec Baldwin and the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy — photo ops made decades ago through her husband’s business and political connections — were included in Palm House promotional material.

More recently, she has mingled at Palm Beach society events with Trump, Palm Beach billionaire Bill Koch, golfer Greg Norman and, of course, Straub.

‘A father figure’

No stranger to controversy, Straub is a proud, hard-nosed businessman with a talent for mining gold from distressed properties and a penchant for butting heads with opponents big and small. He can be pugnacious and polarizing — in January, he was accused of making racially insensitive comments at a Wellington Village Council meeting.

He has forged connections to powerful people, including State Attorney Dave Aronberg, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath and President Trump, who also knows Mia. (In a deposition, Straub says Trump asked about Mia during a phone conversation Straub says he had with the president last summer.)

Straub doesn’t deny that he finds Mia attractive. “She raised two kids, she works and she is beautiful,"" he said.

But he said he always considered himself more as “a father figure” to her, a contention challenged by attorneys opposing Straub in the bankruptcy case. It is the bankruptcy case files, of all places, that contain the most salacious allegations about Straub’s “bizarre and influential” relationship with Mia and her husband.

Straub and Mia have had “a very complicated relationship"" that at some point was “intimate,"" according to allegations by attorney Phil Landau, who represents the entity that owns the Palm House property in the bankruptcy case filed in August.

Why else, he asked, would Straub continue doing business with Mia and her husband after he’d sued them for defaulting on a short-term $775,000 loan Straub gave in 2010 to save their Nantucket home from foreclosure?

That loan included an unusual stipulation, added by Straub, for Matthews to sell the home and put the proceeds into a trust for the benefit of Mia and the couple’s two daughters.

Then there’s the letter Straub wrote to federal prosecutors in June, three months after Bob Matthews was arrested and ordered to stop communicating with potential witnesses, Landau said.

In the letter, Straub asked prosecutors to make an exception for him, describing himself as “an acquaintance” of Bob Matthews and “a close friend” of Mia’s who needed to “provide moral support” since “all of the Matthewses’ other friends are avoiding them because of the indictment.""

Even though permission was granted, Straub said he hasn’t had too much communication lately with Bob Matthews. But he apparently has communicated plenty with Matthews’ wife.

Salacious text messages

Mia hasn’t said much publicly about her relationship with Straub. In fact, she invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 600 times in a deposition Nov. 26 when two lawyers grilled her for seven hours about flirtatious text messages Straub exchanged with her last year.

The actual texts are not included in court records. The only public description of their contents comes from a transcript of the attorneys reading them during the deposition, and those were only a sample of the texts Straub and Mia exchanged.

The text messages, the attorneys say, show that Straub either had or at least pursued a relationship with Mia that went beyond friendship, making him an “insider” who shouldn’t be allowed to seek claims in the Palm House bankruptcy.

“(A)s bad my situation is, I can’t accept your offer to be a significant other in order for you to drop the lawsuit,"" Mia texted Straub on July 16, more than a week after his company sued her and Bob.

“This whole thing is heartbreaking,"" her text continues. “I can’t say that we would end up together, but I will say any hopes of that are dashed with your recent actions and behavior. Being with someone who threatens to put me in jail, promises things, then takes them away, and tells me that he will do whatever he can to destroy me, won’t work. I wish things were different.""

But when the lawyers asked her to elaborate on those and other texts, her response was the same: “On advice of counsel, I’m exercising my rights under the Fifth Amendment and declining to answer the question.""

During the depositions, neither Mia, Straub nor their lawyers disputed the authenticity of the texts.

Texts earlier in the year suggest Mia made several requests to Straub — for a job, for money for her daughter’s acting class and for permission to use his credit card to go shopping.

Other texts suggest they attended a Broadway show. And in others, Straub appears to offer her an apartment in Aspen, Colo., and legal advice about her husband’s criminal case.

On July 3, Straub texted Mia a warning that he planned to sue her in St. Lucie County, an hour from Palm Beach County, to “keep these facts out of the public eyes and your daughter’s friends’ gossip. …"" In a deposition in November, Straub confirmed the text, saying, “That’s a little trick I got. To keep things out of the newspaper, I’ll sue in other counties.""

A month later, on Aug. 8, Mia sent Straub a text that Landau assumed was about her husband: “I talked to him. Told him the truth. He was relieved we didn’t have sexual contact. And understood my desperation in trying to get you to back off the lawsuit. …""

‘You anxious boy’

Other texts sound racy.

“Any interest in a dinner and sleepover party?” Straub asks May 20. Mia replies, “I have church at five. Could do dinner after but no sleepovers yet. You anxious boy.""

On June 18, Mia texted Straub about a pair of earrings she wanted to give to her daughter: “I think I may give her the little hoops you bought me. Is that okay with you?"" Straub replies, “Okay, as you know the prices of gold doubled, so I get one BJ for each side over three days.""

When Landau read those texts, an attorney for Straub’s lending company interjected. “Are you done? Is there a question there? I want to express my embarrassment on your behalf, Phil,"" said attorney Luis Salazar.

Landau replied, “And I’m embarrassed that we have to be here reading through this.""

In his own deposition three days later, Straub was asked if the “BJ” reference was meant as a colloquial term for oral sex.

“When you’re acting as a father figure to women, do you suggest that they should come and give you three BJs for something that you’re doing for them?” asked attorney David George, who represents 61 Palm House investors from China, Iran and Turkey who sued the Matthewses, Straub’s lending company and others in federal court in 2016.

Straub replied, “I do a lot of that kind of comments. To me, it’s like your first-born child. If you don’t pay me, you owe me a BJ. In other words, that’s very, very personal to people. They will usually pay you the money they owe you. …""

Straub admits he encouraged Mia to leave her husband, who is facing 325 years in prison if convicted on all counts, and to move to Aspen. But only so she can get a new start on her life, not to run off with him.

“You can interpret those texts to whatever you want. I never had sex with the girl,"" Straub said Nov. 29 in a deposition. “I’m saying to you, she always fascinated me that she was a worker like my daughters.""

Disputing the attorneys’ characterization, Straub said, “I wouldn’t call it an intimate relationship. It is a relationship with a woman that has got herself in trouble through her husband.""

Mia didn’t invoke the Fifth for every question during her seven-hour deposition. When Landau asked why she was crying, she replied, “My eyes are watering from yawning and from not getting a lot of, from work.""

Straub, who attended her deposition, interjected with a skeptical remark: “She’s an actress.""

‘Character assassination’

Perhaps the most explosive allegation about Straub and Mia was made by developer Ryan Black, a minority owner of Palm House, in an email to Landau on Aug. 29.

Describing a meeting he attended at Straub’s Wellington office in November 2014, Black said Straub was asked why he’d waited to foreclose on the Palm House mortgage five months after Matthews had started defaulting on payments.

Straub replied that “he would give Bob an extension every time Bob let him sleep with Mia,"" according to Black’s email, which is included in court records.

In an interview with The Post, Straub said, “I don’t remember ever, ever making that kind of remark. If I did, I’m sure it was a dumb joke. I’m a 72-year-old guy. I’m allowed to make some dumb-ass jokes.""

Black didn’t return a phone call and email from The Post.

Although Straub wasn’t asked about the Black email during his deposition, he was questioned about the “sleepover” text he’d sent Mia.

“I’d love to have her stay, spend some time with me, but she was always coy,"" he replied. “That’s why we never had sex. She’s been a player from day one.""

In court records, Salazar, the lawyer for Straub’s lending company, accused Landau of resorting to “a character assassination strategy” against Straub because he has a weak case.

“Debtor then makes up this deficit in substantive, relevant facts by dumping a truckload of tabloid fodder that might support newspaper sales in the checkout aisle but here amount to irrelevant tripe,"" Salazar said in an October filing.

None of the salacious allegations about Straub and Mia were mentioned in the time-limited, non-jury Palm House federal bankruptcy trial that ended Feb. 22 when a judge invalidated Straub’s mortgage claim on the hotel.

Meanwhile, Straub continues to deny accusations by Palm House investors in federal and state civil lawsuits that his lending company conspired with Matthews to steal their money.

Best supporting actress?

Barring another rescue from Straub, Bob and Mia won’t be living much longer at Casa Bendita, the spacious $30 million oceanfront mansion they built in 2006 next to a house owned until September by fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.

Once the scene of society galas and charity parties hosted by the couple, Casa Bendita — Spanish for “Blessed House” — is scheduled to be sold at an auction March 28 as part of Bob Matthews’ personal bankruptcy case.

A few months after that, Bob and Mia are scheduled to stand trial in Connecticut along with Palm Beach attorney Les Evans in the Palm House criminal case.

But before that trial, Mia will be judged on-stage April 8 at the 43rd Annual Carbonell Awards, which honor the best of South Florida theater.

She’s been nominated as best supporting actress for her role as Marie Antoinette in “The Revolutionists” at the Theatre Lab in Boca Raton. It’s not her first Carbonell nod.

In 2016, she won for her role in the Miami production of “After,” the same play she’s currently rehearsing for an off-Broadway run that starts March 17 and ends April 14.

ODESSA, Fla. (WFLA) - Where happiness, love and innocence once occupied the Odessa home of Gary and Maureen Myers, now there is a sorrow-filled void.

Four and a half years ago, the Myers lost their 39-year-old son Tommy.

""It's just been like my heart's just been ripped out of my soul,"" Tommy's mother Maureen said. ""You know, I can't tell you how much we loved that child."" Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Photo provided by the Myers family)

Tommy's death certificate states he died from ""complications of multidrug intoxication"" and says he was ""given drugs during a dental procedure.""

""Somebody tried to treat my son, who was not qualified for special needs, and he died,"" Tommy's father Gary explained.

It was Sep. 24, 2014. Gary accompanied Tommy for an appointment with Dr. Veronica Thompson at Grand Dentistry in New Port Richey.

""He had to be sedated with an IV every time that he's gone to the dentist since 2002,"" Gary said. ""You know, he's Down Syndrome, special needs, mentally challenged.""

Tommy didn't understand what was going on around him but his Dad was there for reassurance.

""I'd stand behind the chair and I'd hold his shoulders back, you know. He'd look at me and I'd say, 'Tommy relax,'"" Gary tearfully remembered.

Dr. Thompson adminstered the drugs.

""As soon as she put the anesthetic in him, he started coughing. A real deep choking cough,"" Gary recalled.

Gary claims Dr. Thompson assured him there was nothing to be concerned about. The coughing stopped, so Gary took a seat in the waiting room.

Within 40 minutes, his life changed forever.

""They came into the waiting room and said we had a problem,"" Gary said. ""I think they said that he stopped breathing.""

At that moment, paramedics were already rushing Tommy to Morton Plant North Bay Hospital in New Port Richey.

""He wasn't breathing and he didn't have a heartbeat,"" Gary said.

""Then I got the phone call,"" Maureen added.

She had been home taking care of her sister who had suffered an injury earlier in the week. Maureen got to the hospital as quickly as she could.

""The doctors were doing everything, absolutely everything that they could,"" she remembered.

""He had a tube in his mouth, he had a respirator, he wasn't breathing on his own,"" Gary added. Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Photo provided by the Myers family)

Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Photo provided by the Myers family)

""As soon as I looked at Tommy, I knew. I knew he wasn't going to come back,"" Maureen said as her voice cracked.

A chaplain asked about the family's religious preference. Maureen told her Catholic.

""So a priest came and gave him his last rites,"" Maureen said.

Tommy's parents kept him on life support for two days.

""By this point, his kidneys are failing,"" Maureen recalled. ""He's getting treated for pneumonia, he's getting treated for diabetes.""

With no brain wave activity and no hope for recovery, the family decided to remove him from life support.

""It's like somebody ripped a piece of my flesh out of me, and it's never gonna come back,"" Gary said of Tommy's death.

""I can't tell you how much we have suffered with the loss of our son,"" Maureen added.

Florida's Department of Health investigated Tommy's death. It claims Dr. Thompson made several mistakes, including giving Tommy too much anesthesia too soon - four times the maximum safe dose for a healthy adult.

The state says Dr. Thompson also failed to follow emergency protocol and failed to administer a reversal drug. It added she performed ""deep sedation"" without a permit to do so.

The practice manager for Grand Dentistry sent 8 On Your Side this statement:

“While we cannot discuss protected health information, please know that Grand Dentistry of New Port Richey is committed to providing our patients with high-quality dental care. We ask that you respect the privacy of all parties involved. Thank you for understanding.”

Dr. Thompson has not responded to our request for comment for this report.

""We entrusted his health with her,"" Maureen explained. ""You know, she's had no punishment for Tommy's death and that's not acceptable.""

Four and a half years later, the state has taken no action against Dr. Thompson's license. She still practices at Grand Dentistry.

For Maureen and her family, nothing remains the same. Their special boy, loved so very much, drifted away quickly once life support was removed.

But not before his mother gently told him, ""Just that we loved him, go to sleep.""

532,"Former Bad Company singer Brian Howe plans to sell Fort Myers Beach house, donate to dogs","CLOSE Former Bad Company singer Brian Howe talks about his 2017 heart attack. The animal lover lives on Fort Myers Beach with seven dogs and three birds. Charles Runnells, crunnells@news-press.com

There’s a lot of history in Brian Howe’s house on Fort Myers Beach.

It’s where the rock singer wrote and recorded many of the songs for his old band, Bad Company. It’s where he records his podcasts with people like former band mate Ted Nugent and Moon landing conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel. And it’s where he lives with his beloved birds and dogs, including a particularly friendly “Florida brown dog” named Rosie.

Former Bad Company lead singer Brian Howe is selling his Fort Myers Beach home and moving to Nashville. The longtime animal advocate plans to donate a portion of the sale to the Have a Heart Animal Foundation. HeÕll be holding an open house on April 27. He is shown with several of his dogs.

But now, Howe plans to say goodbye to that house — and to Fort Myers Beach, too.

He’s moving to the Nashville area, where he wants to buy a bigger piece of property, collect more animals and perhaps start a new career as a songwriter.

“There’s mixed emotions,” says Howe, 65, about leaving Fort Myers Beach after living there for 34 years. “But I do believe that every now and again in life, it’s good to shake things up and to make a change. And it’s good to explore new pastures.”

Before he goes, though, Howe wants to do one last thing for the animals he loves. After he sells his beach house, he’ll give a portion of that money to Boca Raton dog rescue group Have A Heart, Inc.

Howe says he’s loved animals since he was a small boy — particularly dogs. That’s why he devotes a lot of time to helping those animals, including recording songs for animal charities and serving on the board of both Have a Heart and Guatemala nonprofit AYUDA (Spanish for “help”).

“Animals don’t really have a voice,” Howe says, sitting with Rosie in his upstairs music room full of guitars, amplifiers and recording equipment. “They don’t have anyone that can speak up for ‘em.

""I’m not pretending I’m some sort of animal hero — because I’m not. But I do love ‘em.”

Howe will hold an open house for his two-story Fort Myers Beach house from 6:30-8:30 p.m. Saturday. The 4,100-square-foot Old Florida-style house — including 2,300 square feet of air-conditioned living space — is listed for $749,000. The property features a wrap-around porch, a downstairs apartment and an Olympic-sized swimming pool.

Howe will be attending the open house, says Realtor Trish Kelly of Advantage Florida Real Estate. Plus there will be food, drinks, live entertainment and a silent auction that includes a signed guitar owned by Howe, a gold Bad Company record, a private acoustic concert and dinner with Howe.

There will also be a collection jar for donations to Have A Heart. All the money raised at the open house will go toward the charity, too, Kelly says.

“I think it’s a neat idea,” she says about the charity event/open house. “It shows how much he cares for animals.”

Janice Green, founder and president of Have a Heart, says the money will be used to help many of the charity's rescued dogs with surgery and other medical needs, including dogs with broken legs and heart worms.

Howe has helped the charity many times over the years, including playing fundraising concerts. “He’s very generous,” Green says, “and he helps us whenever he can.”

Howe says he’s leaving Fort Myers Beach for several reasons. He’s annoyed with the constant construction on nearby Estero Boulevard. Red tide has been causing him breathing problems. And ever since his 2017 heart attack, he can’t endure the heat as much.

Another reason for the move: After years as a rock singer — including recording and co-writing Bad Company’s hit albums “Dangerous Age” and “Holy Water” — Howe’s thinking about trying something new. He’s hoping to start writing with other songwriters in Nashville, and perhaps try his hand at country music or become a full-time songwriter.

""I think I’m more of a songwriter now than I am a singer, although I still love to do shows,"" he says. ""I think I’ve explored most of the avenues of rock that you can go down, I think.

“It’s been a fun ride, but classic rock now is considered to be prehistoric, you know?”

(Photo: Andrew West/The News-Press USA Today Network-Florida, The News-Press)

He’s also toying with the idea of starting an animal rescue of his own, once he has a big enough piece of property to house all those animals.

“I really want to donate more time to helping more animals — and having more animals, I think,” he says. “I love the idea of having a donkey or two, rescuing a donkey. And maybe a pony. Chickens, you know.""

He grins. ""I want to become a farmer!” he says,

Howe doesn’t know how much he’ll be giving to Have a Heart. It depends on what the place sells for. He still needs enough money to buy his new place in Nashville, where he says property sells for much cheaper.

“It’ll be a good chunk, though,” he says.

He says he’ll likely visit Southwest Florida occasionally, since he has lots of friends and family members here (including his son Michael and granddaughter Kira). But he’s looking forward to this new chapter in his life.

“I’ve reached the age now where I really want to do something a bit more substantial with the things I love in life,” he says. “Although I do love music, of course, I love animals so much. And they’ve been predominantly a major part of my life.

“And I just feel that I could offer them more and rescue more animals if I make a move and buy property further north.”

Saturday’s open house is free and open to the public. To get the address, call Kelly at (941) 916-4079 or email HoweOpenHouse@hotmail.com.

SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) - Two teens face felony charges after a 15-year-old was accidentally shot in a crime gone wrong.

One of the teens was well known among the officers for a very violent encounter.

When one officer in particular rushed to Bellasol Apartments Tuesday night, he quickly recognized one of the suspects because he had a run in with him before.

Just before 5 p.m. Tuesday, neighbors at the Bellasol Apartments were alarmed to hear a gunshot.

Within minutes, officers discovered three teens were involved in a crime, and one of them, a 15-year-old boy, was injured.

""It was an attempted robbery that resulted in an accidental discharge of a firearm,” said SPD Spokeswoman Genevieve Judge.

The 15-year-old was shot in the arm. He was rushed to All Childrens’ Hospital for treatment and is considered a suspect.

The other two boys, a 16-year-old and a 15-year-old, both face felony charges.

Officials say they all knew each other.

But the 16-year-old has been in the news before. In February, officials say he was with a group of teens who beat up an off-duty police officer.

The officer was trying to stop them from attacking a homeless man.

That officer was one of the first on scene at last night's shooting.

“It’s extremely frustrating and what’s ironic to all of this is the officer that was involved in that off-duty incident back in February was also one of the first officers that responded to the scene yesterday,” said Judge.

Neighbors in this family-friendly complex are alarmed.

“A lot of kids disrespect their parents, disrespect authority. They think they can do whatever they want in society,” said resident TJ Willman.

""Its just kind of sad that we as a society, our younger generation especially, there's just been a real loss of respect for authority,” said resident Kathryn Rivera.

Mazza wrote ""The Life: A True Story About a Brooklyn Boy Seduced into the Dark World of the Mafia.""

Pier 220 opened New Year's Eve, and Shenoy says business has been good. Having an Academy Award superstar visit the restaurant is the cherry on top.

""We're busy as is, but it's nice for people to come in, and it's a validation to what we do,"" he said. ""It's De Niro, you know? It's iconic.""

538,Prosecutors decline to file charges against teen involved in rough arrest,"BROWARD COUNTY, Fla. - The Broward State Attorney's Office announced Tuesday afternoon that it would not be filing any charges against a 15-year-old boy whose rough arrest by Broward Sheriff's Office deputies last week in Tamarac made national headlines.

""The investigation of the sheriff's deputies' actions is ongoing,"" the Broward State Attorney's Office said in a statement.

The announcement came hours after Deluuca Rolle and his attorneys met with prosecutors.

Rolle's legal counsel said they were seeking to have all of the charges against him dropped, as well as have the deputies involved in the arrest held accountable for their actions.

Rolle was initially arrested on charges of assaulting a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest and trespassing.

Rolle's mother and aunt also joined him Tuesday for the meeting with prosecutors and his new attorneys, Ben Crump and Sue Ann Robinson.

The meeting came five days after Rolle was seen on cellphone video being sprayed with pepper spray, thrown to the ground and punched by deputies. He also had his head repeatedly slammed into the pavement Thursday outside a McDonald's in Tamarac.

""He is a victim. He was abused. That is how he feels,"" Robinson said. ""He is a kid, and he was obviously unarmed and not involved in anything.""

Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony said Deputy Christopher Krickovich has since been reassigned to administrative duties pending the outcome of an internal investigation.

Sgt. Gregory LaCerra, who is accused of pepper spraying the teen, was placed on administrative duty, as well.

Krickovich stated in Rolle's arrest report that he had to act quickly, ""fearing I would get struck or having a student potentially grab weapons off of my belt or vest.""

According to the arrest report, deputies were surrounded by a crowd of teenagers who had gathered in the parking lot to watch a fight after school between two students.

Robinson said she wants to make sure the case is thoroughly investigated and that deputies involved in the incident are held accountable for their actions.

""It is unconscionable what we've seen happen to Lucca at the hands of local law enforcement who are sworn to serve and protect,"" Crump said in a news release. ""Once again, we see that this promise does not extend to people of color -- one would hope that an unarmed 15-year-old child would not be treated in this brutal manner, no matter the circumstances. Starting now, we will seek justice through every avenue possible for Lucca and his family.""

Krickovich has been employed by the Broward Sheriff's Office since August 2012. Local 10 News received a copy of his personnel file Tuesday, which shows that he received ""meets expectations"" and ""exceeds expections"" remarks on his annual employee performance evaluations.

In a 2017 review, it was noted that Krickovich was assigned to the Tamarac crime suppression team. He was commended for being energetic, articulate and having a positive attitude. Krickovich was also called dependable and loyal, and received many other accolades.

LaCerra has been employed by the Broward Sheriff's Office since October 2000 and also received similar remarks on his employee performance evaluations.

In March 2014, then-Assistant State Attorney Evagelia Solomos praised LaCerra's work ethic in a letter to Lt. Ron Barerez.

""I have had the pleasure of working with many wonderful detectives, but Detective Greg LaCerra stands out,"" the letter said.

In the letter, Solomos commended LaCerra for going ""above and beyond the mere arrest,"" investigating other things associated with each case and speaking with potential witnesses to ensure that the prosecutor had ""the best and most thorough understanding of each defendant on each individual case that he presents to me.""

According to his personnel file, LaCerra has also received several other commendations throughout his career with BSO.

541,Man accused of stealing car with child inside is on probation for similar crime,"A father jumps into action, chasing and shooting at an accused carjacker who got away with his 6-year-old son in the car.

The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office Lamar Thurman, 29, is accused of stealing the white, Honda Civic outside a home on Roberts Lane near Lake Worth after 2:30 a.m. Saturday.

He was just released from prison and may be heading back to jail, that is if he survives.

Investigators say the car was parked with the engine on, as the father of the 6-year-old boy was outside saying goodbye to friends.

The father and his friends drove after them, following Thurman for several miles, calling 911 as they chased him.

Thurman eventually crashed on Loquat Tree Drive near Lantana, about four miles away, and was shot several times as he tried to get away again all while the boy was still inside.

Luckily, the boy was unharmed.

A viewer sent multiple photos of the damaged car to CBS12 News after the chaos.

CBS12 News discovered this isn’t Thurman’s first run-in with law enforcement.

The 29-year-old was just released from prison in February after he tried to steal an 86-year-old woman’s car in 2016.

According to state records, he’s on probation until 2022.

He remains in critical condition as of Monday night and faces several charges.",http://cw34.com/news/local/man-accused-of-stealing-car-with-child-inside-probation-for-similar-crime,2019-04-23T02:57:47Z,WTVX,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407

WYOMING, Mich. (AP) — A 5-year-old Michigan boy had a craving for McDonald’s but his grandmother was sleeping so he called 911 and made a request.

WZZM-TV in Grand Rapids reports Iziah Hall of Wyoming asked the dispatcher: “Can you bring me McDonald’s?” Dispatcher Sara Kuberski says she told him no but reached out to the police.

Wyoming police officer Dan Patterson says the April 14 request made him laugh, so he stopped at McDonald’s on his way to check on Iziah’s home in the western Michigan city.

Patterson says he thought, “I’m driving past McDonald’s on my way there and I might as well get him something.” The officer says the first thing the boy said to him was, “My grandma’s gonna be so mad, can you please go away?”

544,Sinking the unsinkable: Florida Navy vet tells of making history in WWII,"ORMOND BEACH -- An old photo rests atop a table in Clint Lake’s Ormond Beach, Fla., home. In it, he’s young, handsome, and ready to take on the world.

And he did.

Lake had hair then and wasn’t bent or hard of hearing as he is now at 93. And though he can’t seem to find his medals, the World War II Navy veteran’s memory remains sharp.

As a dive bomber radioman and gunner aboard the USS Intrepid, an aircraft carrier whose role in the war was so integral it has its own museum, Lake took part in 19 missions — most before he turned 19. By the time the war was through, Lake had ditched his plane in the ocean, survived a kamikaze attack, and helped destroy the Yamato, an “unsinkable” Japanese battleship.

Lake’s story grows more precious with time. Of the 16 million Americans who served in the war, fewer than 500,000 remain.

“It’s kind of scary,” Lake said. “Sometimes I stop and think about it and say, ‘Gee whiz, where is everybody?’”

Lake’s role in the Allied mission to take Okinawa placed him at a historical milestone, and recently officials from the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum came to Ormond Beach to interview him for their oral history project.

“There’s certain things that we can never discover through reading archives and reading books,” said Jessica Williams, museum curator of history and collections. “These are things that really can only be brought to life by speaking with people who experienced it directly.”

Okinawa

Wanting to avoid the grunt work of the Army he feared was about draft him, Lake joined the Navy at 17 on Aug. 2, 1943. After radioman and gunnery training, the Miami Florida native was sent to his new home, a ship so massive its crew numbered in the thousands.

“It was enormous. I had never seen anything that big before,” Lake said of the Intrepid. “We drove up there in a bus and we all kind of gaped, ‘I ain’t gonna ride in that thing.’”

Embarking from Pearl Harbor toward the Pacific theater, Lake’s first mission was to attack Kure, a Japanese naval harbor home to, among other things, the Yamato — a battleship so strong it was whispered to be unsinkable.

Lake’s job on the on the two-man SB2C Helldiver dive bomber was to operate the radio, radar, and two 30-caliber machine guns. He did this while facing backwards, and the view, for better or worse, didn’t allow Lake to see what was in front of him. By design, dive bombers flew high before quickly plunging toward their target and dropping their bombs, meaning they had to get fairly close to the enemy.

Though Lake’s was among hundreds of planes dispatched to attack Kure, Allied forces weren’t able to sink the enemy warships, leaving the Yamato free to lurk seas and Lake to face her another day.

From Kure, the Intrepid headed to Okinawa where it fought in the war’s last major battle. The plan was to take the airbase there and mount a final campaign on the Japanese home islands.

On Easter Sunday, as part of the colossal force assembled, Lake attacked the island, providing fire so that U.S. forces could storm it.

Records show Okinawa was fortified with more than 100,000 Japanese, many dug in further inland waiting to entrap U.S. forces. While the initial Japanese counterattack was muted, it was Lake’s first experience with being shot at or “walking on flak.”

“You could feel the concussion of the flak exploding by you,” Lake said of the way near-misses from anti-aircraft fire rocked the plane.

But there was too much going on to be frightened, Lake said. And soon, he would be on another mission.

Hunt for the Yamato

Having come to know the Yamato’s menacing reputation first-hand, Lake knew he would be in for a fight. As the lead battleship for Japan’s Imperial Navy, the ship was big, armored, and loaded with a daunting array of more than 200 guns.

Despite the Yamato’s prowess, because of a fuel shortage it was ordered to beach itself at Okinawa and fight until destroyed. If the ship made landfall, its heavy armament and troops — determined to die for their homeland — could wreak havoc for Allied forces already on the island.

“They were going to do what damage they could,” Lake said. “It was kind of a suicide mission and they were going to run this battleship up on land and give the sailors some rifles and say goodbye.”

Fortunately, Allied forces decoded Japan’s battle plans and U.S. submarines spotted the Yamato before it made landfall. With this, on April 7, Lake and hundreds of others were ordered to dispatch the monster ship.

A dot in the vast Pacific, the Yamato remained elusive until new coordinates were given, ones that Lake said placed him directly in the ship’s crosshairs.

“We were flying along at about 4,000 feet and someone on the radio said, ‘If you turn right you’ll run right into the big boy,’” Lake said. “We turned right and boom! The ship fired at us.”

As Allied planes swarmed overhead, the Yamato unleashed hell, lighting up the skies with antiaircraft fire. Undaunted, Lake’s plane dove, swooping down to bomb the ship.

While Lake returned to the Intrepid, records show that after a relentless Allied attack, the Yamato hung listless in the sea before capsizing. She exploded before finally plunging into the Pacific’s dark waters.

The myth was no more.

Japan’s revenge

The war was not yet over and before Lake would return home, the empire of the rising sun would have its revenge.

On April 16, just 11 days after sinking the Yamato, Lake was below deck filling up his cigarette lighter when the Japanese attacked the Intrepid as it was patrolling the waters near Okinawa. He felt the ship vibrate. Alarms sounded.

“A kamikaze, one of their death planes, attacked us and hit the deck,” Lake said.

The aircraft fired on the ship before crashing through its flight deck, the force propelling the plane clear down into the hangar deck below. A museum excerpt of gunnery officer Lt. Commander William Lindenberger’s journal tells of his up-close encounter of the attack.

“We knew he was a 'Kami-Kazi' and knew he would fly his plane into us unless we exploded him in mid-air. All the ships guns pumped shells into him but he kept coming down. Pieces of his wing broke off but he didn’t swerve from his course,” Lindenberger wrote. “I had the feeling that he couldn’t possibly miss me. Everyone feels that way when a plane is bearing down on him.”

“He passed over my head out of view, our gun ceased firing just before a terrific jar shook the whole ship,” he wrote. “Then an explosion resounded through the decks, followed by two distinct shuddering vibrations. It felt as if some giant sledge hammer had fallen with all its force.”

SEE THE ATTACK HERE: Kamikaze suicide plane attacks USS Intrepid (CV-11) - 16 April 1945

With the flight deck ablaze, the ship was locked down as crews worked to put the fire out, Lake said.

All Lake could do was wait and hope.

While he was unharmed in the attack, others weren’t so lucky. Reports show that nine men perished.

The Intrepid, which during the war was struck by a torpedo and survived four kamikaze attacks, was called the “Dry I” because it spent so much time being repaired in dry docks. After the April 16 attack, the ship headed back to the U.S. Most of its crew was ditched at Saipan where they waited until being picked up by another ship.

And in an instant, the war was over.

Like many who served, Lake lost friends but said the cause was worth it. Making a choking motion with his hands, Lake said, “I would’ve liked to have gotten a hold of Hitler myself.”

After the war

Once back in Florida, Lake attended Stetson University, performing as a cheerleader and majoring in teaching. He wound up in banking and worked in DeLand before moving to Ormond Beach and working for what was then known as First Atlantic Bank for 23 years.

After his wife passed away in 1974, Lake married his current wife, Nan, who also was widowed. He has two adopted children from his first marriage and is a stepfather to Nan Lake’s four children.

For his service, Lake was awarded two air medals and a gold star.

“I often wondered what would’ve happened to me if there hadn’t had been a war,” he said.

Then he wouldn’t have his story, one that Williams said was important and worth preserving.

“There will be a time when there will be no surviving crew members of the Intrepid. We treat these stories the same way we treat our uniforms and our gear and our photograph collection,” Williams said. “Our goal is to ensure they last into the future as long as the Intrepid exists or beyond even ... so they will be available for future generations to learn from and ask questions about and think about.”

Glancing at the 75-year-old photo sitting atop the table, Lake downplayed the notion that he helped shape history.

“I didn’t do anything,” he said.

551,Rosanne Cash remembers and it rings true | Music Roundup,"Rosanne Cash’s latest album, “She Remembers Everything,” is the fierce and tender soundtrack of a woman claiming her power — all of it, the accumulated power of the past and the ancestors, the power of lovers and children and broken dreams and hard roads, the power of the breaking and mending of a heart, over and over.

“There is a woman’s real life, complex experiences and layered understanding in these songs,” Cash said of the 2018 release. “I could not have written them 10 years ago — not even close. Time is shorter, I have more to say.”

Boy, does she ever. Cash is a survivor. She has survived the hazards of fame — that of her father Johnny Cash and stepmother June Carter Cash, that of her first husband Rodney Crowell and that of her own fame, which plunged her into the meatgrinder maw of the Nashville music machine before she finally fled to New York City, where she now lives with husband John Leventhal.

Cash has survived addiction, a bitter divorce (that, after the dust settled, yielded an enduring and fond friendship with Crowell) and the loss of father, stepmother and mother all within the span of two years. Most recently, she survived brain surgery to treat a rare condition responsible for decades of debilitating headaches.

Rosanne Cash will perform at Opening Nights at 7:30 p.m. Saturday in Ruby Diamond Concert Hall. (Photo: Rick Diamond)

All along, she has spun the dross of her life into gleaming gold on such albums as “Seven Year Ache,” “King’s Record Shop,” “Interiors,” “The Wheel,” “Black Cadillac” and “The River and the Thread.”

And, now, on “She Remembers Everything,” an album that will ring like a great bell of truth to those of us of a certain age, those who’ve run out of damns to give and have discovered the freedom and power that conveys. And such is the musical and lyrical power of Cash’s flinty, unflinching and graceful songwriting that the album will ring true for anyone with open ears and an open heart.

The album’s central anthem is “Everyone But Me,” which was almost an afterthought, according to an interview with NPR.

“I had written these lyrics in my notebook and just kept them for myself, and didn't think it could be a song — I thought it was too raw to be a song,” Cash said. “And then John (Leventhal) and I were recording in the studio one day, and we hit a wall, and he said, ‘What else you got, kid?’

“I felt like when I lost my parents, I didn't really lose them yet — for better and for worse. You spend a long time extricating yourself from trauma, and there's both and love and rage, and it's not just me. That's a universal feeling, I think.”

She sings:

“Mother and father, now that you’re gone,

It’s not nearly long enough,

Still it seems too long;

I gave up my name for you,

Gave up my edge, it made me bleed,

And I pleased everyone,

I mean, everyone but me;

There behind the closing door,

I’m not enough and then too much,

Our strange and beautiful lives

Fade and turn to dust.

It’s all there - gold from dross, treasure from pain, the bittersweet rewards of enduring.

Cash and her band will perform that song and others from “She Remembers Everything,” as well as songs from an upcoming musical version of “Norma Rae” that she’s writing with Leventhal and hits from throughout her career to close the Opening Nights season at 7:30 p.m. Saturday in Ruby Diamond Concert Hall. Tickets are $65, $55, $45 and $25 general public, $32, $27, $22 and $12 students. Visit openingnights.fsu.edu.

554,"After nearly 32 years at South Daytona, Joe Yarbrough to see out sales tax vote","Come May 22, Joe Yarbrough will have more free time to go out on a fishing boat with a couple of beers and drift as far away from government offices as he likes.

No worries. No phone calls to answer. No more complaints from residents or elected officials.

Until then, though, the former city manager of South Daytona, who actually retired more than a month ago after three decades on the job, has to see something through that he started nearly five years ago.

When the ballots are mailed out next week for a special election on a half-cent sales tax that would raise money for road and water infrastructure projects throughout Volusia County, the final countdown on Yarbrough's government service will begin — and the results of the May 21 tally will determine if his final send-off includes a victory lap.

Yarbrough, 67, is already viewed as a role model to other city managers who came on after he arrived. And he's beloved by the residents who appreciate his folksy charm and attention to public service, including one who tells of the time the manager rushed to his house to look after a child who had accidentally eaten glass.

After a more than 40-year career in the public sector, Yarbrough's profile has never been higher. It was he who over the past five years relentlessly lobbied and cajoled leaders at Volusia's 16 cities to unite behind the sales tax push, which he has joked more than once may be the first time they've agreed on anything.

But no matter the outcome of the tax, Yarbrough has no intention of leaving his home in South Daytona, where he lives with his wife, Bobbie, and where he raised two sons. Gabriel, 37, works as a chemist with the city of Daytona Beach, while Joey is currently a doctor working a residency in Shreveport, Louisiana. At 27, he's about the age his father was when he took his first city manager gig.

Yarbrough, a University of Tennessee alum, started in the mountain tourist town of Gatlinburg — when Jimmy Carter was in the White House. Then one of the youngest city managers in the country, Yarbrough would often struggle to fall asleep, worried that he’d messed up somehow or let down his residents, employees.

While his sleep got better through the years, he still encountered restless nights from time to time even after he came to South Daytona in 1986 and became one of the longest-serving managers in Florida.

""It's probably good that I've been that way,"" Yarbrough said from his home on a recent Friday afternoon. ""It got a little bit better, but I never really got rid of that, I don't think. It kept me from getting lackadaisical. I don't want to disappoint those who hired me, and I certainly didn't want to disappoint the community.""

Even post-retirement, he expects that insomnia to return maybe to an even greater degree in the coming weeks as he anxiously awaits the sales tax verdict. Unlike his managerial decisions and policies, this is completely out of his hands. He's done all he can do.

Either way, he said, ""I probably won't sleep much the night before the election.""

'Too much credit'

Yarbrough is quick to downplay his role and deflect praise toward the city employees who work alongside him.

He will admit, though, that uniting Volusia's cities on the sales tax push was one of the toughest things he's done. And if he weren't so humble, the Tennessee man and son of a newspaper reporter would probably call it one of his most significant achievements.

Others see it that way. The effort took him five years, several failed attempts, a lot of negotiating, and more than a little Southern charm.

With his drawl, ""he knows how to relate to people in a way that doesn’t come across as threatening,"" said Michael Pleus, who has worked for the city of DeLand since 2000 and was named its manager in 2008. ""He helps people understand the importance of working together.""

Pleus now has ""big shoes to fill"" as he's been tabbed to take over as chair of the Volusia Manager's Association, a role Yarbrough has held for decades.

It was in that capacity that Yarbrough worked behind the scenes to win manager approval for the sales tax, which was required before elected officials could come on board by adopting a resolution and before it could be placed on a ballot. But Yarbrough doesn't want credit for any of it.

""As chair of the managers, I felt it was going to fall on me if I didn't do it,"" he said, adding that his primary job was to facilitate cooperation among cities. ""I did not do anything; they (other managers) did it. All I did was peddle it, and I get too much credit for that.""

Ormond Beach Manager Joyce Shanahan said Yarbrough deserves credit.

""One of Joe’s greatest strengths is getting communities to collaborate with one another. He’s continually championed the motto that we are always more successful working together than trying to go it alone,"" Shanahan said. ""Joe’s continuously been the boundless advocate for the profession and a skillful professional. I, for one, have learned lots from him.”

Howard Tipton, a former Daytona Beach city manager who now lives in Port Orange, knows how challenging it is to get 17 government entities to join forces for a cause. He advocated for consolidating fire services in 2011, but failed to convince his peers even while armed with a study that showed the idea would save money and be more efficient.

""It’s very difficult to get the county manager and all the cities to come together to agree on anything, "" Tipton said. ""He (Yarbrough) has done a yeoman's job leading this effort with the sales tax.""

The sales tax, if approved, would generate an anticipated $42 million a year to be split among cities and the county. City and county leaders have been working to convince voters that it’s the only way to fund road and water fixes, and that a half-cent sales tax would put Volusia on equal footing with its neighbors and most other counties in Florida. Some residents, though, have objected to the cost, the way the county has managed growth or how the vote has been handled.

Tipton can't think of a better retirement gift for the out-going South Daytona manager than an election win.

""I hope that for the sake of the county the voters approve it,"" Tipton said. ""He (Yarbrough) certainly stayed in there and gave it his best effort and he’s to be applauded for that.”

'He was there'

After four decades in the public sector, Yarbrough understands that every action comes with critics — and the sales tax vote is no exception. But he acknowledges how fortunate he's been that controversy never put him at odds with the council. He felt especially lucky to work alongside the same mayor for 20 years, the late Joe Piggotte.

The city's new mayor, Bill Hall, a former police chief, doesn't view Yarbrough as favorably.

""I think it was time for him to go,"" he said. ""I think it was time for the city to have a breath of fresh air. I don’t throw rocks at people, but it was time. I think any time you have a person who stays for three decades you look for new ideas. He’s a very intelligent man and he’s done very well and I wish him all the best.""

In a city the size of South Daytona, which has a population of more than 12,000, the city manager is often the first person that residents call for animal issues, billing questions or police matters. Yarbrough took some heat for that in 2003 when the union accused him of meddling into official police business.

The police chief at the time, Gary White, defended Yarbrough, chalking it up to ""small town politics.""

Yabrough was always just a phone call away for Andy Lyons, who met Yarbrough as a former News-Journal reporter but came to know him well as a South Daytona resident. He's still grateful for the time in 2004 when the city manager came to his house with paramedics after his son, a toddler at the time, dropped a jar of jelly on the floor and put broken glass into his mouth.

Lyons' wife was alone with the boy at the time and neither she nor the paramedics could get the frightened boy to open his mouth through the pain and blood.

Yarbrough, with a commanding voice, piped up: ""Open your mouth, Noah.""

The child obeyed.

""That’s the kind of city manager and friend Joe Yarbrough was,"" recalled Lyons, now the communications director for a hospital in Charleston, South Carolina. ""For the Lyons family what’s so significant about that moment, it’s not just that he had the commanding voice, it’s the fact that Joe Yarbrough was there. He was there for you.""

And he's been there for three decades, even as other cities tried to snatch him away with offers for more money. What has kept him here so long?

It's an easy answer.

""The city has been very good to me,"" he said. ""Rarely do you get to have a child and raise it and stay in the same school system. I have a youngin' that was born right here in the hospital and grew up here. Having that family here helps.

""Yes, I could have left and made more money, but why?"" Yarbrough said. ""I had a home here. I've spent longer here than I have any one place in my life. It's my home.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190425/after-nearly-32-years-at-south-daytona-joe-yarbrough-to-see-out-sales-tax-vote?rssfeed=true,2019-04-25T13:07:51Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

557,"Martin County sees larger number of children using e-cigarettes than St. Lucie, Palm Beach counties","STUART — In Martin County, 23.3% of children between the ages of 11 and 17 use e-cigarettes.

That fact, mentioned in a youth substance abuse survey recently completed by the state, surprised a group gathered Wednesday morning at First United Methodist Church.

""If 23.3% of our youth in Martin County are using these substances, chances are we know a kid, we have a kid or are related to a kid that has these substances,"" said Kim Nash, the community health advocate for The QuitDoc Foundation, a non-profit organization that's part of Tobacco Free Florida.

""It's more common than we think. It's not something that you know only in a certain area or at a certain school. This is definitely affecting our entire community.""

About 45 people attended the event — the quarterly Community Conversations hosted by the United Way of Martin County.

Many in attendance were officials from organizations including the Martin County School Board, Children's Services Council of Martin County, Martin County Department of Health and the Boy's and Girl's Club of Martin County.

Nash spoke about the concerns her agency has with the increasing number of children in the county using these vaping devices.

""Our rates here in Martin County are higher than St. Lucie County, They're about on trend with Indian River County and they're higher than Okeechobee and Palm Beach counties,"" said Nash.

Anthony Calzadilla, assistant principal of Jensen Beach High School, said parents should be talking with their children about e-cigarette use before children enter high school.

""This is affecting every single youth in our county in a negative or an indirect way,"" he said. ""If we don't put an end to it, we're going to have very highly addicted kids.""

He said a nicotine patch — often used to help a person quit smoking by helping to reduce withdrawal symptoms — does not have enough nicotine to combat the nicotine that's in Juul.

Nash said e-cigarette products, such as Juul, have recently become popular with children because they're meant to go unnoticed.

""They don't omit an odor; they don't make a noise; they look like a flash drive. It's very hard for teachers to see that this is going on in a classroom,"" she said.

She said often when she talks to children about e-cigarettes, they believe they're just breathing in flavored water and don't realize they're also breathing in nicotine.

Nash said when someone breathes in one puff of a Juul pod, they get an entire cigarette's worth of nicotine in one breathe.

""So when you're introducing nicotine at such a young age, you're now changing the way that your brain is going to deal with addiction for the rest of your life, and that's terrifying,"" she said.

Joe Flanagan, the assistant principal for Anderson Middle School in Stuart said it's difficult for teachers to know when students have been using e-cigarettes because the products don't typically smell like cigarettes.

""It smells like bubble gum or it smells like fruit candy, which is the sneaky way that it's being done,"" he said. ""The first time I was doing a legal search looking for a Juul, I thought it was a flash drive.""

Martin County Schools Superintendent Laurie Gaylord said one of the biggest concerns with children using e-cigarettes is that the long-term effects of the devices on children are unknown.

""You don't see a lot of middle school kids that are smoking cigarettes, but we have a lot of middle school kids vaping because, No. 1, their parents don't know it, and, No. 2, people don't realize the dangers of it,"" she said.

560,"House backs tougher texting, driving ban","- Law-enforcement officers could pull over motorists they see texting and driving, under a measure approved Tuesday by the House despite concerns the change could increase racial profiling.

However, the Senate is set to vote Wednesday on a different proposal that would only allow motorists to use hands-free wireless devices when they are traveling on Florida roads, a restriction that House leaders haven’t supported.

The House voted 104-9 on the proposal (HB 107) by Rep. Jackie Toledo, R-Tampa, and Rep. Emily Slosberg, D-Boca Raton, that would shift texting while driving from a “secondary” offense to a “primary” offense.

Currently, police can only cite motorists for texting behind the wheel if they are pulled over for other reasons. By making it a primary offense, police could pull over motorists for texting while driving.

The House approved a similar measure last year, but the proposal failed to advance in the Senate.

“This bill is about one thing, saving lives,” said Slosberg, who has followed her father, former Rep. Irv Slosberg, in pushing for traffic-safety changes in the Legislature.

Emily Slosberg’s twin sister, Dori, was killed in 1996 when a speeding car in which they were passengers struck a median and crashed into an oncoming car.

As part of the House bill, law-enforcement officers would have to record the race and ethnicity of people who receive citations for texting while driving, which could allow tracking if certain motorists are being targeted.

Numerous black and Hispanic lawmakers raised concerns that making texting while driving a primary offense would lead to increased racial profiling of minority motorists.

Rep. Patricia Williams, D-Lauderdale Lakes, said she voted for the bill to save lives but wasn’t happy about how the measure could impact the “children that I serve.”

Williams said her son, who is a law enforcement officer, told her “you know you’re going to have problems with those officers not wearing the uniform for the right reasons.”

Rep. Dotie Joseph, D-North Miami, also raised concerns about law-enforcement officers targeting people of color like herself.

“These are issues that we cannot just brush under the rug,” Joseph said. “These are issues that in the current climate of our national discourse, people are afraid to get into these debates. People are afraid to get into these conversations because they make us uncomfortable.”

Rep. Al Jacquet, a Lantana Democrat who opposed the bill, warned of the potential repercussions of the measure.

“We’re going to look, and I want you to remember these words, we’re going to look back and we’re going to say, ‘Boy, were we wrong,’ ” Jacquet said. “While we had the right idea, the right mindset, the way we laid it out created a whole new problem.”

Meanwhile, without questions or comments, the Senate on Tuesday set up for a final vote its hands-free wireless proposal (SB 76).

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Wilton Simpson, a Trilby Republican next in line to become Senate president, is supported by traffic-safety advocates who want motorists to put down cell phones and other devices.

Both proposals would toughen the state’s longstanding ban on texting while driving, with the Senate measure also making it a primary offense.

Efforts in prior sessions in the Senate to toughen the law to a primary offense have failed, at least in part, because of concerns about racial profiling.

As part of Simpson’s proposal, county clerks of court would be able to dismiss cases of first-time offenders when violators buy wireless communications devices that can be used hands-free.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/house-backs-tougher-texting-driving-ban,2019-04-23T22:40:25Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
561,Ronsisvalle: Turning that inner voice from foe to ally,"Marriage counseling can be tough for counselors as well as those seeking counsel. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

I was 25 years old and just beginning to see patients as a psychologist in training.

I’ll never forget the moment I watched the first couple I would ever see as a marital therapist drive up to the clinic and walk in for their first appointment.

The thing that struck me was how successful they appeared. The husband stepped out of a Mercedes and he appeared to be at least twice my age.

His wife was wearing high-end designer clothes that I could only dream of purchasing for my new bride.

Buy Photo Dr. Mike Ronsisvalle (Photo: FLORIDA TODAY FILE)

As I walked into the waiting room to meet them I had a rush of insecurity wash over me. I tried to fake confidence as I extended my hand toward my new clients.

“I’m Mike, we spoke on the phone yesterday,” I said.

The husband looked at me in disbelief, then looked at his wife and said, “here’s the big counselor you brought me to see, huh?”

It was a humiliating moment in large part because I felt almost as if I agreed with him.

That little voice inside my head was screaming negative messages about me, my value as a budding professional and the reality that I was about to waste everyone’s time pretending to be a competent psychologist.

As the session went on, my inner voice got louder and louder.

“They see right through me.”

“Don’t blow this.”

“I’m an imposter right now who has no idea what to say next.”

It was indeed a torturous 50 minutes of psychotherapy. I could not have been any more relieved when they walked out the door.

What astounded me even more was the fact that they made another appointment. I had to go through all this again.

After that first session I used the husband’s condescending statement and my negative inner self-talk as motivation to learn everything I could about marital therapy.

I was determined to utilize the same “succeed or suffer” mentality that had driven much of my success and self-discipline in the past.

I’m sure that many of you have utilized the same critical voice as motivation for success in different areas of your life.

How many of us have tapped that monster within to motivate us to train harder for athletics or get through rigorous seasons in our professional life, or even commit to a difficult marriage?

Many of us use our critical voice to help us hone in on our faults and weaknesses before other people have a chance to identify them and use them against us.

And this is essentially the paradox of that monster within us all: it undermines and attacks us to protect us from feeling the shame of failure and criticism by other people.

So over time, the voice of the monster within can essentially cripple us and our attempts to succeed and keep us stuck in an unhealthy pattern of negative self-talk and criticism.

There is a better way.

I spoke with my supervisor about the couple and eluded to the fact that I was using my feelings of inadequacy as fuel to drive my success with them.

“When he’s condescending again I will use that as motivation to study harder,” I said with as much bravado as I could muster.

More: Ronsisvalle: Is civility gone and kindness a thing of the past?

More: Ronsisvalle: The shortest path may not be the best option

My supervisor immediately cautioned me with a warning about using the monster within for that purpose.

“Mike, using those self-critical messages will ensure that you approach your profession driven more by fear of failure than by passion or inspiration,” he said.

His words struck me right between the eyes. I resonated deeply with the idea that real joy had almost become an elusive emotion since I started my training.

I had traded my joy for anxiety and stress about my performance. Over the next several weeks I used my supervision time to develop some strategies to ensure that I no longer gave the monster within any leverage in my life.

And sure enough, as I practiced these strategies the self-critical messages became less and less intense.

Here’s the simple steps I used to crush the power of the voice of the critical monster in my head.

Self-distancing. The solution to self-critical thoughts isn’t to attempt to shut down the monster’s voice completely. That will never work.

The voice will only come back stronger and with more intensity. Trying to run from the emotions created by the self-critical thoughts will only create a negative cycle of rumination in which you feel the negative emotions, then spend inordinate amounts of time trying to examine why you are always so self-critical.

When you practice the art of self-distancing you replace the first person pronoun “I” with pronouns that are more distant like “you” when you are talking to yourself.

For instance, when the silver fox insulted me in the waiting room I rehearsed a thought that sounded something like this: “Why give another person the power to make you feel like a fake?” or “ why do you feel like such a sham now when you feel so confident in the classroom?”

I know it seems too easy, but the first person thought mode actually feels very personal. Self-distancing allows you to pause, step away from the situation and intentionally consider a rational response as if it had happened to someone else.

Normalize the monster’s voice. When we find that we have entered the negative cycle of self-criticism, one of the best strategies we can employ is to normalize the idea of that monster’s voice in your head.

“Oh boy, here we go again. That monstrous critical voice is at it again.”

Positioning the self-critical voice as something that is likely to happen allows us to detach from the criticism instead of identifying with it and allowing it to dominate us in the moment.

Value the process over the outcome. Once we begin to feel some distance from the monster’s critical voice, we can begin to change the story we are rehearsing about failure or inadequacy.

If we can truly begin to believe that struggle and failure is a part of life then we are in a position to learn from whatever situation we find ourselves in.

We can now rehearse new thoughts in the moment that become much more productive.

For instance, with my couple in marital therapy I began to rehearse these messages: “I can’t control whether or not this couple gets better. I can do everything possible to prepare for these sessions and just let my best effort be good enough.”

These are the moments that I am learning to deal with difficult clients who throw me curve balls in session. This is an awesome learning experience.

The key to choosing process over outcomes is based squarely on our willingness to embrace our own brokenness and to allow ourselves to exercise self-compassion.

Practice transcendence. The opposite of self-criticism is not affirmation, it is actually transcendence.

That means that the real solution to an obsession with the voice of that critical monster in your head is to believe beyond any shadow of a doubt that we are a part of something bigger.

In my work with the couple years ago, I intentionally rehearsed these kinds of transcendent thoughts in my preparation for the sessions with them: “this couple is very different from me, but they have value and inherent worth and their marriage deserves a chance to thrive.”

The outward focus of the inherent worth of my clients and the value of marriage as an institution in our culture set me free to get outside of myself and my own fear and to focus on the needs of the clients.

That transcendent outward focus opened the door to my own self-compassion and it crushed the remaining power of the critical monster within me.

A Titusville man used a hidden recording device to make videos of several people showering and using the bathroom at his home without their consent, according to the Brevard County Sheriff's Office.



Jonathan Moist was arrested and charged with video voyeurism Thursday after a months-long investigation that began in November of last year when two young women were housesitting for Moist at his Diamond Road residence.

One of the two realized the USB charger in Moist's bathroom was suspicious and recalled using it to charge her phone when she housesat for him in the past. The device was inspected and an SD memory card was found inside, according to arrest reports.

567,Winter Springs boy runs alongside sheriff to honor fallen deputies,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - A Winter Springs boy ran alongside the Orange County Sheriff's Office on Thursday evening.

During the annual Corporate 5K along Lake Eola, Zechariah Cartledge, 10, ran with Orange County Sheriff John Mina.

Zechariah said that he wanted to honor the fallen deputies of the department.

""It makes me feel really touched inside, but it also makes me feel like that if all these people watched the videos, they found out about the officers I ran for and found out more about them,"" said Cartledge.

News 6 first showed viewers little Zechariah last month while he was carrying his flag. He said that he has run more than 100 miles for officers killed in the line of duty.

“Sheriff Mina pushes me to my limit, and he did amazing today as well, so, I want to thank Orange County a lot,"" said Cartledge. “It’s not about the time, it’s about running for the officers, running to respect them and I’m just glad that we did it.""

Sheriff Mina said that it's moving to see a 10-year-old with passion to honor the people to protect and serve.

""It’s truly amazing. It makes me smile really big inside,"" said Mina. “We’ve all lost friends in the line of duty and it hits home. And we think about that all the time and then when our community members especially someone so young thinks about our fallen officers, as well it means the world to us.”

Cartledge also said it was inspiring to watch the deputies run in full uniform.

""I asked the sheriff how much gear he was wearing on him. He said about 25 pounds. I was like, 'Oh my gosh that's like half of me,'"" said Cartledge.

568,"'Help me!' Michigan teens hear cries, rescue kids on spring break trip","MELBOURNE, Fla. - Tyler Brueck and Alex Byrd heard the noise, but they didn’t know exactly what it was right away.

Brueck and Byrd were boogie boarding on Melbourne Beach in Florida on April 7, thinking at the time it was just going to be a normal, relaxing day while on spring break with their lacrosse team from Clarkston High School in Michigan.

It turned out to be anything but normal from the moment they heard the noise.

“We noticed these two kids five to 10 (yards) out to the right of us and we were maybe 50 yards from the shore,” Brueck said. “We heard screaming. We weren’t sure if they were just messing around or what’s happening. After paying closer attention, we hear ‘Help me.’ It was a boy and a girl.”

The kids were caught in a rip current and in need of rescuing, and Brueck and Byrd probably felt they weren't so qualified for the task, considering neither had never had any previous lifeguard training.

But instinct took over and Brueck and Byrd swam toward the children.

Byrd grabbed the boy, while Brueck put the girl in his arm, as both teens initially struggled with the rip current themselves.

“I had her around my one arm and I was trying to swim with the other,” Brueck said. “I knew to swim horizontally, so that’s what I was doing. I was trying to use the waves to propel me forward. It was working and I got to calmer waters and carried her out to shore.”

Once everyone was on shore, came the expected tearful and happy reunion, as the parents of the kids ran up to Brueck and Byrd to offer their appreciation.

“The mom was crying and hugged me and thanked me,” Brueck said. “The dad was in disbelief. He shook my hand and thanked me as well.”

Brueck estimates the age of the boy was 8 and the age of the girl was 6, but they never officially found out because the family left the beach a short time later.

They don’t know where the family was from or if they were on a spring break trip, as well.

“They were probably traumatized,” Brueck said.

Whoever that family is, they’ll likely never forget Brueck and Byrd, who in turn will never forget that day that started off so leisurely.

“We just thought it would be a normal spring break day,” Brueck said.

569,Interactive map shows where Florida's nuisance alligators are,"Watch out for increased alligator activity as the weather warms.

April is alligator courting season, which means the frisky crocodilians may be venturing out more in the hopes of finding a companion before mating season begins in earnest in May and June.

With an estimated 1.3 million alligators in Florida, the state's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is warning the public to be aware of the increase in alligator activity this time of year and the possibilities of encountering them.

And don't think the prehistoric predators are confined to wildlife areas. A map of where nuisance alligators have been removed includes all areas of the state, from Pensacola to the Keys. And there's plenty of activity documented in Polk County.

""They can literally be in any puddle of water,"" said Boynton Beach resident Richard Cochran, who removed nuisance alligators for the state until last year when an unrelated back injury sidelined him. ""Not to scare people, but there are over a million of them and they are all around.""

Statewide, 6,700 nuisance alligators were killed or relocated in 2017. That increased to 7,114 last year, according to FWC data.

Areas with the highest removals are in and around Tampa, Sarasota, Orlando, Fort Myers and Jacksonville. Tampa topped the list in 2017 with 181 nuisance gators but was bested last year by Sarasota, which tallied 205.

West Palm Beach and its suburbs racked up a total of 205 removals over the past two years, with 139 taken from Wellington and 77 from Palm Beach Gardens.

Even tiny Palm Beach had at least one removed during the same time period when a wayward gator found itself on the beach side of the Intracoastal.

""They've been at people's front doors, in retention ponds, swimming pools,"" Cochran said. ""Pools aren't uncommon. They just push through the screen and off they go.""

American alligators are no longer an endangered species, but are protected under a classification that allows only people with special licenses and permits to take them.

That means Floridians can't just call up the local alligator trapper to remove one like they would if it were a raccoon or possum.

Instead, the FWC operates the Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program, where people can report a suspicious gator. The FWC decides whether it poses a risk and will then assign a trapper that it contracts with and licenses.

Cochran said if a nuisance gator is 4 feet or longer and the trapper doesn't have a special permit to take it alive, it's usually killed. Otherwise, nuisance gators can be sold to an alligator farm.

""I don't like to kill them, and I had a license not to for a couple of years. I found it more enjoyable to be good to them,"" he said.

Over the past decade, Florida has averaged seven unprovoked alligator bites to humans per year that are serious enough to require medical treatment. From 1948 through 2008, 410 unprovoked bites have occurred, with 25 ending in the person's death.

One of the people killed was 10-year-old Bradley Weidenhamer, who died after he was attacked by a 400-pound alligator on the Loxahatchee River in 1993.

In June 2016, 2-year-old Lane Graves died after he was snatched from the shore of a Disney World resort by an alligator. Six alligators were killed following the boy's death.

Two years later in June 2018, an alligator killed 47-year-old Plantation resident Shizuka Matsuki while she walked her dogs in Davie's Silver Lakes Rotary Nature Park.

""When temperatures rise, an alligator's metabolism increases and they begin seeking prey,"" an FWC press release says. Although alligator bite incidents resulting in serious injury are rare in Florida, the FWC recommends taking precautions when having fun in and around the water.

Jeremy tells WFLA that they wanted the ceremony to be as fun as possible so they got married in the back of their friend's pickup truck and the bride even wore an all white bikini as opposed to your average wedding dress.

The backroad romance even included a dip in the mud after the couple said I do.

Jeremy tells us that their love is ""country boy love"" and he couldn't be happier.

Congratulations and yee-haw to the happy couple.

577,"Letters to the Editor: April 24, 2019","Criminal trial for Sarah Heard was waste of resources

I commend the jury for recognizing what a sham the criminal prosecution of Commissioner Sarah Heard was.

It's unbelievable that the state prosecutor's office had Nita Denton lead the prosecution. An all non-Martin County prosecution team would have avoided any perception of a vendetta, given that Heard and Denton were both members of the Martin County GOP organization for years.

Commissioner Heard deserved the public embarrassment she went through. However, I wholeheartedly approve of the verdict. A state ethics commission investigation would have been far more appropriate. We have a free and open elections process for ridding ourselves of officials who are caught in breaches of integrity short of felonies or severe misdemeanors.

Aggressive criminal prosecution of polarizing elected officials over minor violations that public officials around the state commit every day is a waste of resources. It also borders on Bolshevism.

Compared to President Trump, Obama was a saint

I would like to agree with Pat Parker (Letter, April 1) that Carl Hiaasen’s characterization of President Obama as a “Boy Scout” was erroneous; compared to the current president, he’s more like a saint. Imagine, being married to the same woman without being adulterous. Yes, it does take just a smidgeon of character, which leaves the current president out.

Was Obama perfect? Of course not, but he has a thousand miles of decency between him and the current president.

Parker goes through three whole “lies” that Obama told, somehow missing the daily lies coming from the current president’s mouth. One of these “lies” was about the Benghazi tragedy; evidently, Parker missed the eight Republican investigations and the millions spent to find out it was a just that, a tragedy.

As for lying, the current president has established himself as someone who, if he said his name was “Donald J. Trump”; you would be entirely justified in asking for identification. Come on, he lied about where his father was born! He did it as easily as he breathes. But Parker’s standards evidently only come into focus when it comes to Obama.

Then, Parker goes into Obama’s school records, something that has never been asked of any president. But I get it. He, being black, couldn’t have gotten into a nice school unless he was given loads of help and, in Parker’s mind, was admitted solely on his race. Never mind that Obama was editor of that sophomoric rag, The Harvard Law Review. He probably got that, too, because he was black.

But again, back to the current president, a man who threatened his schools with lawsuits should they reveal his grades. As the current president once said, “What’s he got to hide?”

In the current president’s case, everything!

U.S. needs effort like Manhattan Project to build southern wall

With no help from Congress, and the judicial branch, including the Supreme Court, blocking all proposals by the Trump administration to be able to handle the onslaught of illegal asylum seekers and criminals, it is time for President Trump to take a more direct action. To keep from sending more personnel, and building more facilities to handle the number of people and to let the influx go unchecked, the wall is essential to focus the points of entry.

It is reported that the old fences are being replaced with a more substantial fence and new fence is being built, but not at the rate required to get the situation under control. Just as the United States did in WWII, we need a ""Manhattan Project.”

To educate those who are too young and others, this was a project that was needed to build the facilities to produce the atomic bomb before the Germans. Gen. Leslie Groves of the Army Corps of Engineers was appointed to the job of organizing and building the facilities and infrastructure required to produce such a weapon based upon ongoing research in the late 1930s.

From 1940, in less than five years, the feat was accomplished, and you know the results; it ended WWII in mid-1945. If we did that massive project in less than five years, surely with the proper leader and within the military budget we could build the necessary wall in two years.

What are traffic light cameras for?

Why was taxpayer money spent on traffic light cameras?

I was in a car accident and falsely given a ticket because a witness claimed I went through a red light. When I called the traffic department the very next day to get a copy of the accident report — and prove the light was green for me — I was advised that not only are the cameras not monitored but they don’t record!

If they recorded for a week or some period of time, they could be a source of revenue for the city/county from individuals/insurance companies requesting a copy. And even more vital, they would be an aid to law enforcement for Amber Alerts, Silver Alerts (e.g., Susy Tomassi’s disappearance), and as a crime-solving tool.

Currently, the Indian River Shores Public Safety Department utilizes a license plate reader system (cameras), which the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office and the Vero Beach Police Department can access if a crime has been committed in their jurisdiction and there is reason to believe a suspect has fled to Indian River Shores.

Wouldn’t the current traffic light cameras be just as effective to identify suspects of criminal activity in the county?

What purpose do these traffic light cameras serve?

578,Blue Wahoos host big Easter weekend with four events,"CLOSE Blue Wahoos pitcher Dusten Knight performs a celebratory backflip after closing out game. Courtesy of the Pensacola Blue Wahoos, Pensacola News Journal

The perfect weather was only part of the Pensacola Blue Wahoos memorable Easter weekend.

In two days, the Blue Wahoos (12-5) won two games, extending the best record in the Southern League, staged their massive Egga-Wahooza Easter Egg Hunt and hosted an inclusive sunrise Easter Sunday service produced by Marcus Pointe Baptist Church.

It was a lot in a short time. But with big impact.

Essentially within 36 hours, the Blue Wahoos welcomed more than 20,000 people to their bayfront stadium and Community Maritime Park.

“I think it’s really special,” said Blue Wahoos President Jonathan Griffith. “It meets the whole mission of the Blue Wahoos to improve the quality of life, and to have 20,000 to come down and enjoy what we have to offer at the stadium is really great.”

Sunday featured back-to-back events. The stadium provided a spectacular setting for the annual Community SonRise Service, which began at 6 a.m. with a sunrise amid crystal clear sky above Pensacola Bay and lighting its way over the left field portion of the stadium.

Once the service was complete, a professional team of event installers took down the stage, cleared the field, removed all items and enabled the Blue Wahoos to play the Mobile BayBears at 5 p.m.

The Blue Wahoos then raced to an 8-0 lead, powered by a pair of home runs, before winning 8-5 before a crowd of 3,647.

Saturday night, the Blue Wahoos delighted a sellout crowd of 5,038 in a 5-0 win to extend their fast start and first place standing as the new affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. In that game, Sean Poppen, a Harvard University graduate who was making his first Blue Wahoos start, threw five scoreless innings before the bullpen took over.

“It’s been impressive to see,” said Poppen, referring to the Blue Wahoos fast start. “Coming after in after our (previous) starters and what they have done…. I am glad I was able to put up zeroes on the board and keep that going.

“They have set the standard of excellence that everyone wants to reach now.”

The game Saturday also included the team’s periodic “Homerun for Life” moment to showcase a youth or adult who has battled serious illness or hardship. In the case of Saturday’s event, John Matthew Peacock, who turns 4-years-old in May, leaped into the waiting arms of Blue Wahoos mascot Kazoo, who met the boy at home plate after he ran the bases.

Both teams came out of their dugouts to line the baselines in the fifth-inning event.

Peacock’s mother, Jessica Stevens, explained in a biography provided by the Studer Family Children’s Hospital at Sacred Heart, she was 30 weeks into pregnancy when diagnosed with a medical condition. Her son was born four weeks early and spent two weeks in intensive care.

After being born weighing only 4 pounds, he slowly got better and out of danger. At 3, he started learning Spanish. He became a Blue Wahoos fans and is now playing wee-ball.

“The thing we do there… that is great,” said Blue Wahoos manager Ramon Borrego, seeing his first Homerun for Life. “You could hear a lot of the players… it was the first time they saw it and they were talking about how great. It was an unbelievable thing to see.”

Earlier Saturday, the Blue Wahoos hosted what organizers said was the largest of the Egga-Wahooza plastic egg hunts. More than 5,000 kids were part of the scene.

An all-night effort ensued after Saturday’s baseball game to get the venue ready for church service. This was the first time since the Blue Wahoos inaugural season in 2012 they have played a home game on Easter.

“We had people had people in here all day, all night long,” Griffith said. “We were able to get everything off the field by 11 a.m (Sunday) so we know next time we can have an earlier game and keep our 2 p.m. start on early-season Sunday games.

Sunday, reliever Dusten Knight punctuated the Blue Wahoos’ victory against the BayBears with his signature backflip, after recording his fourth save in four attempts. The three-hour game featured 22 hits, including 13 for extra bases, before Knight sealed the deal.

“I love that feeling. I love the adrenaline that comes with it,” said Knight, 28, an Oklahoma native, who pitched in the San Francisco Giants organization before the Minnesota Twins acquired him in December. “I love the excitement.

“And I love being that guy out there who helps my team win. It is what every relief pitcher lives for. That is our dream job to have.”

The Blue Wahoos will continue their season against Mobile on Monday with flame-thrower Brusdar Graterol on the mound. Tuesday, Devin Smeltzer will pitch only five days after sustaining a line drive off the back of his neck in a road game against Biloxi.

The weekend became the Blue Wahoos biggest on an Easter weekend. In 2012, the egg hunt was only a couple hundred kids on the field. This year, it was a three-hour event with two separate children’s divisions of age groups scouring for the eggs.

“It is exciting,” Griffith said. “When (fans) are here they are seeing good baseball. When you lose by a lot people notice. We’ve been in every game (all five losses by one run).

The four events in 36 hours reinforce what Blue Wahoos Stadium and the team have meant. The Blue Wahoos are approaching their 500th home game in franchise history.

“With everything that is happening downtown, this is another layer of that,” Griffith said. “Making Pensacola that strong town that we want. That award we won (Strong Towns No. 1) comes from the hard work we have done in our community.”

591,Doctors find possible cure for 'bubble boy' disease,"(CNN) - In a major breakthrough for the medical world, doctors believe they have found a solution for children born with an immunodeficiency disorder known as “bubble boy"" disease.

Jayceon Golden, 2, is a pretty typical toddler, who likes to play ball and peek-a-boo with the door. But when he was born, his aunt Dannie Hawkins, who takes care of him, thought moments like this might never be possible.

“What kind of life would that be? Nobody touch him. He can’t have friends. He can’t go to birthday parties. He can’t swim. How am I going to tell him, as he gets older, that he can’t go outside?” Hawkins said.

When Jayceon was born, he tested positive for a rare genetic condition known as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency disorder, which basically meant he had no functioning immune system.

The condition became a part of pop culture after John Travolta played a boy with the same diagnosis in the 1976 movie “The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.”

In real life, kids with the disease don’t actually live in hermetically-sealed rooms, but it is critical to keep them as best protected from germs and pathogens as possible.

""These babies are prone to severe infections, opportunistic infections, if they are not treated properly - on time, early on,” said Dr. Eliaf Dokmeci with the University of New Mexico.

Current treatment requires those diagnosed to undergo a bone marrow transplant and a lifetime of immune-boosting maintenance with antibiotics and other drugs.

But in a study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors described a newly developed gene therapy that they believe may be a “cure” for children like Jayceon.

""Three to four months post the infusion, not only was he able to go home and start to live a relatively normal life, but we were able to take him off complete isolation and all prophylactic medications,” said Dr. Mort Cowan, who oversaw Jayceon’s treatment at the University of California, San Francisco.

The experimental therapy, which was developed at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, TN, involves harvesting bone marrow cells from a child with the disease, inserting the healthy gene that is missing in these patients and infusing them back in to repopulate and restore the immune system.

""I don’t use the “cure” word very often for these patients, but I have to tell you I truly believe we’ve cured Jayceon of his severe combined immunodeficiency disease,” Cowan said.

Jayceon is one of eight children treated with the therapy. They were on average 3 1/2 months old. It’s been between 1 1/2 to two years since they were treated, and all are doing well.

""From a physiological point of view and from a 'quality of life' for these patients, this is a cure. The question will become, will it be a durable cure? Will it last 10, 20, 50 years for these children? And only time will tell,"" said Dr. James Downing, president and CEO of St. Jude.

Dr. Ewelina Mamcarz, first author of the study and a researcher at St. Jude, says the therapy is still in the early phases of development. It is performed in combination with a chemotherapy called busulfan, which is most commonly used in bone marrow transplantation.

“It's too early to estimate the overall cost, but we want it to be accessible to any and every child who needs it,"" she said. ""Most patients require just one infusion, and because we were able to restore fully their immune system, they did not require any additional therapies, like in transplant,” she said.

X-linked SCID affects at least 1 in 50,000 to 10,000 newborns, primarily boys, according to the US National Library of Medicine. If left untreated, it’s rare a child with the disease would live beyond their 2nd birthday.

In the United States, all newborns are screened for SCID, of which there are several types based on which gene defect is involved.

Researchers intend to investigate how the gene therapy could be used to treat patients of older ages and with other types of disease.",http://www.wfla.com/national/doctors-find-possible-cure-for-bubble-boy-disease/1936971791,2019-04-18T21:20:37Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
592,Second arrest made in death of toddler,"A second arrest has been made in connection to the death of a 1-year-old boy.

West Palm Beach police arrested Octavius S. Wiggins on Thursday for the Nov. 18, 2018 death of a 1-year-old boy. The boy died at St. Mary's Medical Center. According to West Palm Beach Police, the medical examiner ruled the cause of death as complications of a ""spinal cord injury."" The report said the boy suffered the injury from being ""struck in the back at the base of the neck with a belt.""

During a non-custodial voluntary sworn statement, Stephanie Michelle Robinson, the boy’s mother, said he received facial injuries from falling at a park and in her backyard. She said her boyfriend, Wiggins, also watched the victim and that he must have caused the other injuries.

In a second non-custodial voluntary sworn statement, Robinson said that she met with the Wiggins on Nov. 18 and Wiggins admitted to striking the boy with a belt, according to police. On April 15, Robinson said that on Nov. 1, 2018, she left her residence and left the child in Wiggins' care. She said the victim had no fresh injuries.

When she returned later the same day, about 30 minutes before 911 was called, police said. She said Wiggins brought the boy to her from his bedroom. She said he was alert and looking at her, but his body was completely limp.

She asked Wiggins what he did to the victim and he told her “all I did was beat him with a beat.”



Wiggins is currently in custody facing charges of aggravated manslaughter of a child and aggravated child abuse.

593,Man who allegedly pretended to be Illinois boy indicted by grand jury,"Advertisement Man who allegedly pretended to be Illinois boy indicted by grand jury Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Brian Rini, the man who allegedly pretended to be missing Illinois boy Timmothy Pitzen, has been indicted by a grand jury on charges related to making false statements to federal agents and aggravated identity theft, federal officials said.A federal grand jury indicted Rini, 23, on Wednesday and the indictment was filed Thursday, federal officials said. Rini was charged by criminal complaint April 6 with one count of making false statements. Thursday's indictment includes two counts of making false statements and one count of aggravated identity theft, federal officials said. The incident began April 3 when Rini was found in northern Kentucky, claiming to be Timmothy Pitzen, an Illinois boy who has been missing since 2011.Federal officials later confirmed Rini was actually an ex-convict from Medina, Ohio. Rini allegedly told officers his name was Timmothy Pitzen and that he was abducted when he was 6 years old and he “just wanted to go home.”Local authorities confirmed that Pitzen's name was associated with a missing and possibly abducted child. Specifically, in 2011, Pitzen, then 6 years old, went missing from Aurora, Illinois, Pitzen was picked up at his school by his mother, and a few days later, his mother was found deceased in a Rockford, Illinois, hotel room.Several notes were found in the hotel room that claimed Pitzen was with people who loved him and would take care of him. The notes also stated he would never be found.Posing as Pitzen, Rini allegedly claimed he had recently escaped from a hotel room in which two men had been holding him captive. He said he had been sexually and physically abused for years while in captivity and that he was having abdominal pain.Rini was transferred to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Emergency Room because of the complaint of abdominal pain, and there, FBI task force officers met with Rini to potentially investigate sex trafficking and crimes against children. FBI special agents and a detective from the Aurora Police Department also spoke with Rini.It is alleged that Rini continued to claim to be Pitzen throughout conversations in the hospital.Rini refused to provide his fingerprints to investigators at Children’s Hospital; however, eventually, he agreed to submit a cheek swab for DNA testing.DNA test results confirmed Rini’s identity. As a known felon, Rini’s DNA was known to the FBI. Ohio Department of Corrections records indicate Rini was released from an Ohio prison March 7.Once law enforcement officers confronted Rini about his true identity, Rini immediately stated he was not Pitzen. He allegedly said he watched a story about Pitzen on ABC's ""20/20"" and stated he wanted to get away from his only family. When questioned further, it is alleged that Rini stated “he wished he had a father like Timmothy’s.” Rini is scheduled for arraignment on the indictment at 1:30 p.m. Friday.",https://www.wesh.com/article/man-who-allegedly-pretended-to-be-illinois-boy-indicted-by-grand-jury/27196908,2019-04-18T20:53:00Z,WESH-TV,Couple,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789

One near-drowning happened at the Sheraton hotel.

A father was vacationing with his daughter when a nearby mother told him her son was in trouble.

He jumped in, pulled him to the edge of the pool and started performing CPR.

""I checked his pulse, he had no pulse. And as CPR was about to get started he spit up some water, so we put him on the side and gave him some back thrusts. He opened his eyes and progressively got better.

A 26-year-old Palm Bay mother was charged Wednesday in the death of her 14-month-old son after detectives determined she left the boy alone in a car for hours while she drank at a bar, smoked marijuana and searched for cocaine. An autopsy showed that the baby suffered a fatal heat stroke while locked in the woman's car, reports show.

Emily Hartman was charged with aggravated manslaughter by neglect, possession with intent to sell cocaine and possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana, after an investigation by Melbourne police. Detectives determined that Hartman left the boy, identified as Richard Wighard, alone several times on April 3.

Melbourne police issued a warrant for Hartman's arrest earlier this week.

Hartman, now in custody, will go before a judge at the Brevard County Jail Wednesday for a bond hearing.

Detectives were called to investigate the case after Hartman turned up about 1 p.m. on April 4 at Melbourne Fire Station 71. Detectives said Hartman had left her child in the car alone as she drank with a friend at a bar the night before.

Police said that after leaving the bar, Hartman spent the overnight hours meeting with several people. She turned up later at a North Melbourne home where she left the child in the car alone for up to six hours as she went inside and smoked marijuana.

Hartman - who police said also obtained several grams of powdered cocaine - admitted that the car's engine was off during the times and that the boy was still strapped in his car seat, reports show.

Hartman left the home on April 4 and noticed the child appeared in 'distress,' reports show. She then drove the child to a fire station where paramedics worked to revive the boy.

Hartman, who brought her unresponsive baby to the station, told paramedics he was suffering from unidentified medical problems.

Paramedics determined the baby was suffering a ‘heat-related illness’ and rushed him to Holmes Regional Medical Center for further treatment.

601,Day care funded defense of two employees accused of molesting children,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Bright Horizons, one of the country’s largest child care providers, paid thousands of dollars to defend two former employees accused of molesting children at two of its Florida daycare facilities, court records show.

In both cases, court records indicate Bright Horizons executed payment agreements with West Palm Beach criminal defense lawyer Nellie King and attorney Thomas Pavlinic, a Maryland-based lawyer who specializes in sex crimes defense.

""Everyone accused of a crime is entitled to competent legal representation,"" King told News 6 in response to questions about the payment agreements. ""Most large employers carry insurance for unforeseen events, including those that may require legal representation for employees.""

In each of the cases, prosecutors filed court papers raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest resulting from the financial relationship between Bright Horizons and the criminal defense attorneys.

""The fee structure of (the former day care employee's) defense counsel creates an incentive to advise him to proceed to trial and not plead guilty,"" an assistant state attorney prosecuting one of the cases wrote.

""Everyone wants a just outcome to this painful case, and assisting former employees in finding competent counsel to guide them through an unfamiliar process also assists justice,"" King said.

Pavlinic, her co-counsel in both criminal cases, did not respond to multiple emails from News 6 seeking comment.

Jayrico Hamilton, 26, recently agreed to plead guilty to three counts of lewd and lascivious conduct.

The former employee of the Bright Horizons facility in Orlando’s Baldwin Park neighborhood committed sex crimes against a 4-year-old boy, according to the Orlando Police Department.

In 2017, the state attorney in Broward County dropped all criminal charges against Olakunle Omomowo, 44, following accusations of prosecutorial misconduct.

Authorities arrested the former teacher more than three years earlier for allegedly molesting multiple girls at Discovery Preschool, a Bright Horizons facility in Coconut Creek.

After the state attorney in Broward County dropped the charges, Florida's governor signed an executive order transferring Omomowo's case to a neighboring state attorney's office for review and possible future prosecution.

Bright Horizons representatives did not respond to more than two dozen questions from News 6 about the company’s payment agreements with the criminal defense attorneys.

""As you’re aware, there is pending civil litigation related to this matter,"" an unnamed Bright Horizons spokesperson wrote in an email. ""We feel we must respect the civil court judge assigned to this case who recently cautioned all parties as it relates to engaging with the media. For that reason we feel we cannot respond further.""

Two weeks after Bright Horizons provided that statement to News 6, the company’s civil attorneys filed motions seeking formal gag orders in the cases, citing concerns of obtaining fair trials in Orange County. The judges have not yet issued rulings on the requests.

Shortly after police arrested Hamilton, a Bright Horizons spokesperson told News 6 the company fully supported the investigation.

""The well-being of the children in our care is our primary concern,"" former Bright Horizons communications director Bridget Perry said in that February 2018 statement. ""We were deeply troubled to learn of this new development, and we are committed to supporting our families in any way we can.""

The child care provider did not respond to multiple inquiries from News 6 seeking comment about Hamilton's decision last month to plead guilty to lesser sex crime charges.

“When the families of children who were allegedly sexually abused by their teachers at Bright Horizons learned that Bright Horizons was paying for the criminal defense, they felt revictimized,” attorney Jeff Herman said.

His law firm has represented several families in civil lawsuits against Bright Horizons.

“In my opinion, their behavior is repugnant and instead of protecting the accused pedophile, Bright Horizons should be engaged in efforts to help the victims,” Herman told News 6.

Payment agreement between Bright Horizons and attorneys detailed in court filing

While Omomowo was being criminally prosecuted in Broward County, parents of his alleged victims filed lawsuits against Bright Horizons.

As part of that civil litigation, the confidential payment agreement between the child care provider and Omomowo's criminal defense attorneys was made public in court filings.

""Bright Horizons has agreed to pay the attorneys for Mr. Omomowo's legal defense,"" states the July 2013 contract authored by Stephen Dreier, the company's current executive vice president.

King and Pavlinic signed the payment agreement in July 2013, approximately one month after Omomowo's arrest.

Under the agreement, King and Pavlinic could each bill Bright Horizons at an hourly rate of $350, but no more than $125,000 total for both attorneys, for any work prior to the case going to trial.

Bright Horizons also agreed to be responsible for third party costs such as airfare, rental cars, lodging, expert witnesses and court transcripts, the agreement stated.

""Bright Horizons understands that all decisions about handling of the case are exclusively between Mr. Omomowo and the attorneys. The attorneys will provide regular updates to Bright Horizons about the status of the case,"" according to the agreement.

The payment agreement also provided instructions on how the lawyers should handle inquiries from news organizations.

""The attorneys will use reasonable efforts to notify Bright Horizons about any media contact they receive about the case,"" the agreement noted. ""The attorneys will not invoke Bright Horizons' or Discovery Preschool's name in any respect with the media without Bright Horizons' prior written approval.""

The existence and terms of the payment agreement were to remain confidential unless the parties were required by law or the court to disclose it, the agreement stated.

That agreement became public record as part of the discovery process in the civil litigation, according to court records.

Broward prosecutors raise conflict concerns

Weeks after Broward County prosecutors learned about the financial arrangement between Bright Horizons and Omomowo’s attorneys, the state attorney’s office notified the judge about a potential conflict.

""The Payment Agreement indicates that Bright Horizons has the right to terminate the Payment Agreement, and therefore no longer pay for the Defendant's criminal defense, if the Defendant makes a confession to any of the allegations relating to students at the facility,"" Assistant State Attorney Stacie K. Wilensky wrote in a September 2016 court filing.

Prosecutors noted that they had previously relayed a plea offer to Omomowo that would have given him a sentence of probation instead of possible life in prison.

As part of that plea deal, Omomowo would have been required to make a statement regarding his molestation of the victims, according to the state’s filing.

""The Payment Agreement suggests that, if the Defendant had accepted the State's offer, Bright Horizons no longer would have paid for his defense,"" wrote the prosecutor.

The state attorney's office also highlighted another term of the agreement that granted the attorneys a combined fee of $6,000 per day should Omomowo's case advance to a jury trial.

""The potential financial benefit to the attorneys to proceed to trial could be seen as a disincentive to plea,"" the prosecutor said.

There is no record of Omomowo's attorneys filing court papers in response to the state’s conflict notice.

State drops charges against Omomowo

In March 2016, jurors in one of the civil cases found Bright Horizons ""vicariously liable for the wrongful acts committed by their employee Olakunle Omomowo"" and awarded $3 million to the alleged victim, court records show.

The parties later reached a confidential settlement for a different sum as Bright Horizons entered into separate settlements with the families of four other alleged victims, according to court records.

Ten months later, King and Pavlinic filed a motion seeking to dismiss the criminal case against their client due to alleged prosecutorial misconduct.

The attorneys noted that the former supervisor of the state attorney's Sex Crime Unit, Dennis Siegel, left the prosecutor’s office to work for the Herman Law Firm, which was representing the alleged victims' families in their lawsuits against Bright Horizons.

Omomowo's attorneys claimed Siegel remained in communication with his former colleagues and subordinates at the state attorney's office while working with civil attorney Jeff Herman.

""The State has actively sought to aid Herman Law in signing up clients who could point the accusatory finger at (Omomowo) so that Herman could then springboard the claims of these minors into multi-million dollar lawsuits,"" King and Pavlinic wrote in their 53-page filing.

The judge presiding over Omomowo's criminal case never had the opportunity to rule on the defense attorneys' motion to dismiss the case.

On the same day the defense accused prosecutors of misconduct, State Attorney Michael Satz announced his office was dropping all criminal charges against Omomowo.

""(Mr. Omomowo) spent 43 months in jail for something he did not do,"" King told News 6.

Two weeks after Omomowo was released from pretrial custody, former Gov. Rick Scott signed an executive order transferring the case from the state attorney's office in Broward County to the state attorney in Palm Beach County.

""To avoid a conflict of interest or any appearance of impropriety, (Satz) has voluntarily disqualified himself and has requested the executive assignment of another State Attorney with respect to the investigation and prosecution of this case and all related matters,"" Scott's executive order stated.

Gov. Ron DeSantis recently extended that case reassignment through January 2020.

A spokeperson for Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said she could not comment on the active case, but acknowledged it had been transferred to his office for potential future prosecution.

Bright Horizons representatives did not respond to an inquiry from News 6 asking whether it would fund Omomowo's defense if Aronberg's office re-files criminal charges.

King and Pavlinic did not indicate whether they would represent Omomowo again should he find himself in need of a criminal defense attorney.

Hamilton discusses Bright Horizons payments in jail phone call

In June 2017, the first of two families filed civil lawsuits in Orange County against Bright Horizons and former employee Jayrico Hamilton, court records show.

The parents alleged that Hamilton had sexually abused their children at the company's Baldwin Park location.

In February 2018, following a monthslong investigation, Orlando police took Hamilton into custody on a warrant alleging sexual battery on a child.

After his arrest, Hamilton placed a phone call from the Orange County jail to his roommate.

During that conversation, which was recorded by jail personnel, Hamilton and his roommate discussed Bright Horizons paying for his criminal defense lawyers.

""I got some minor good news from your attorney,” the unidentified roommate said, apparently referring to the lawyer representing Hamilton in the civil cases. ""I guess she's still trying to work some magic to get Bright Horizons' insurance to pay for it.""

""They already did,"" Hamilton replied. ""There's some guy named Tom Pavlinic, but he's up in Maryland. So we're just trying to get them to change it to somebody local, more preferably (Orlando criminal defense attorney) Lyle Mazin.""

Mazin was never hired to represent Hamilton.

Instead, Omomowo's former attorneys, Pavlinic and King, filed notices in court announcing that they would be Hamilton's lawyers.

Mazin told News 6 he did not know why he was not chosen for the case.

News 6 submitted a question to Hamilton through his lawyer asking whether he was under the impression that Bright Horizons would pay for any attorney of his choosing.

King did not provide an answer to that inquiry on behalf of her client.

""Mr. Hamilton received zealous and aggressive representation from not one, but two, attorneys nationally recognized for their defense in these types of cases,"" King said.

Bright Horizons representatives did not respond to questions from News 6 inquiring whether the defense funding agreement was contingent on Hamilton using the same two attorneys the company had previously paid to represent Omomowo.

During the recorded phone call from jail, Hamilton and his former roommate celebrated the announcement that the child care provider would be helping to defend him against sex crime charges.

""That's good news they got somebody, because that's better than a public defender,"" the roommate said.

""Hell yeah,"" Hamilton replied. ""If nothing else, I don't want no damn public defender. Not for no case like this.""

""I think they probably, they finally figured that if this case goes well for you, it helps their case in the end,"" said the roommate.

""Yeah,"" replied Hamilton. ""Plus I think everyone has come to realize exactly what is going on.""

In an email to News 6, King indicated that her client is not the only beneficiary of funding from Bright Horizons.

""The same insurance coverage afforded to Mr. Hamilton is also providing legal representation for other former and present employees who were potential witnesses in the criminal proceeding,"" she said.

Prosecutors ask Hamilton to waive conflict of interest

Unlike the payment agreement in the Omomowo case, the contract between Bright Horizons and Hamilton's legal team has not been publicly released as part of a court case.

A clinical psychologist testified in January that Bright Horizons was paying him $350 an hour for his work on behalf of Hamilton's criminal defense. The same expert witness said he previously worked with the attorneys in the Omomowo case.

Earlier that month, prosecutors asked the judge to “engage in a colloquy” with Hamilton regarding any potential conflicts of interest that could arise from the payment agreement.

""The fee structure of his defense counsel creates an incentive to advise him to proceed to trial and not plead guilty,"" wrote Assistant State Attorney Jenny R. Rossman in a motion requesting Hamilton waive any conflict of interest claims.

The motion also suggested that Bright Horizons' liability in the civil suits hinges on Hamilton not pleading guilty in the criminal case.

""The State's interest in this matter is solely to ensure that the Defendant does not later claim ineffective assistance of counsel based on a conflict of interest,"" the prosecutor wrote.

King says it is false and irresponsible to infer that her client's defense was compromised.

""Mr. Hamilton was asked in court on two occasions whether he was satisfied with the counsel he selected and his response was, 'absolutely.' The State indicated there were no conflicts of interest at the same proceeding,"" King said.

According to the state's motion, the defense team brought in an outside attorney, Michael Snure, to advise Hamilton regarding any potential conflicts of interest related to the payment agreement.

""There was no conflict, only the potential of conflict. The conflict never arose,"" Snure later told News 6. ""These are fine lawyers. They fulfilled their professional obligation to Mr. Hamilton.""

Snure, who said he worked on the case pro bono and was not compensated by Bright Horizons, disputed suggestions that the payment agreement discouraged Hamilton from entering a plea or gave his attorneys a financial incentive to take the case to trial.

""Neither of those two things happened,"" Snure said. ""The kid entered a plea.""

Hamilton to plead guilty as civil cases continue

Under a plea deal signed last month, prosecutors agreed to drop the most serious charge against Hamilton, capital sexual battery, which would have carried a mandatory life prison sentence if he was convicted.

In exchange, Hamilton will plead guilty to three counts of lewd or lascivious conduct, court records show, a second-degree felony with a maximum prison sentence of 15 years.

Instead of recommending prison time, prosecutors agreed that Hamilton could serve 15 years of supervised probation as a sex offender while receiving credit for the year he spent incarcerated in the Orange County jail while awaiting trial.

The state attorney's office also agreed not to file criminal charges against Hamilton in connection with undisclosed allegations against him from 2017.

A judge will formally sentence Hamilton May 7, court records show.

""The strength of the defense efforts is reflected in the disposition of the case to probation,"" King said.

The first of two civil cases against Hamilton and Bright Horizons is scheduled for a jury trial in September.

606,A fighting Chance: New drug saves Milton boy,"MILTON — After losing her infant daughter Kensley to a rare genetic disease eight years ago, Destiny McCalvin vowed to exhaust every option when her third child, Chance, developed the same disease. She believes Chance would not have survived spinal muscular atrophy if not for a new drug.

Kensley appeared healthy until around 2 to 3 months old, McCalvin said.

“She always kept her hands closed,” McCalvin said. “They were so tensed up and we didn’t know why.”

She and her husband Justin also noticed she couldn't hold her head up.

At each monthly checkup, doctors kept telling her to wait, McCalvin said. She said it took her husband coming with her and demanding answers at the six-month checkup to get a referral to Shands Hospital in Gainesville.

“They knew immediately what she had,” McCalvin said.

The doctor promptly admitted Kensley into the hospital. He brought 20 medical students to see Kensley’s symptoms, McCalvin said. Kensley had little control over her head and limbs. She was breathing hard and her body was bell-shaped.

“They pulled us into a room,” McCalvin said, “basically telling us, ‘Your daughter has a genetic disorder called SMA (spinal muscular atrophy). It’s a two-week test but she has every sign for it and she has two weeks to live.”

The hospital suggested one of two options: either let Shands monitor her while the family stayed at the Ronald McDonald House or go home and put 6-month-old Kensley into hospice care. The McCalvins chose the latter.

Destiny said hospice made Kensley comfortable, even giving her musical therapy, and she beat doctors' expectations by living two more months. McCalvin said her daughter loved the outdoors but they couldn’t take her often for fear of her contracting pneumonia.

One day, the family took Kensley out for her first boat ride.

“We had the best day ever,” McCalvin said.

When they got home, Kensley's 2-year-old brother told her he loved her.

“Right after, we saw her belly go down,” McCalvin said.

It was the last breath Kensley took. Justin could not resuscitate her.

Two years later, the McCalvins decided to try having another child.

“We mustered the courage,” Destiny said. “I felt it was more for my husband, because our daughter was his only biological child. My first child (Bryce) he helped raise.”

In researching SMA, Destiny found out she and her husband were both carriers of the disease and there would be a 1-in-4 chance their child would develop it.

However, because SMA is not on the list of conditions for which hospitals test, she had to demand it. So at 16 weeks, she got the test, and two weeks later the McCalvins got the devastating news. Their son had SMA — the same disease that took his sister’s life.

By this time, Destiny was a part of an SMA Facebook group. She asked if anyone knew of any trial drugs.

“We knew what nothing’s going to do,” she said.

Through this group, Destiny learned about Spinraza, the first SMA treatment. Biogen, a pharmaceutical company, was in the first phase of the drug’s development. She contacted Dr. Richard Finkel at Nemours Children’s Hospital in Orlando and through him, Destiny was accepted into the trial.

Chance was born Sept. 30, 2015. He is now 3 years old and doing well now, McCalvin said.

“Now he’s just growing. I can’t believe how well (the drug has) done,” she said.

Every four months, the family makes the same trip to Orlando for treatment.

“During surgery they put him to sleep, draw out a tablespoon of spinal fluid and replace with Spinraza,” Destiny said. “He has to lay flat for an hour. Then he wakes up and he’s ready to go.”

She said Chance resists the process but he gets to wake up to his favorite foods: pizza and chocolate pudding.

Not only is Chance otherwise living as a normal 3-year-old, but he hasn’t shown any side effects from the drug for two years, Destiny said.

Chance was originally supposed to be named Justin Jr., Destiny said, but the family's ordeal inspired his parents to name him Chance. Renewed by their son’s success, the McCalvins had another child 15 months ago and named him Justin Jr.

Not only did Justin Jr. not develop SMA, he does not have the defective gene that could have been passed to his children.

Starting in August of 2020, expecting parents in Florida will be able to get tested for SMA.

McCalvin said expecting mothers should get this test.

“Better safe than sorry,” she said. “Like Down syndrome, you’d want to know if your kid has it. I lost my daughter at 7 months old. It’s not a joke. It’s very serious.”",https://www.srpressgazette.com/news/20190420/fighting-chance-new-drug-saves-milton-boy?rssfeed=true,2019-04-20T13:49:32Z,Santa Rosas Press Gazette,Couple,"6576 Caroline St, Milton, FL 32570, USA",FL,32570
607,Cell phone video shows takedown of teens by Broward deputies,"Cell phone video from a witness shows a rough takedown involving a teenage boy.

Broward Sheriff's Office deputies say they responded to a disturbance at a McDonald's near J.P. Taravella High School Thursday afternoon.

At some point, things escalated and a deputy was caught on camera pepper spraying a teen.

The same deputy appeared to body slam the teen in the video before, slamming his head against the pavement and punching him on the side of his head. Two teens were taken into custody, but it's not clear if they will be charged.

Sheriff Gregory Tony released a video statement Friday afternoon, saying he would launch a ""thorough investigation"" into the incident.

“It may take some time but we will be transparent, and if folks need to be held accountable, it shall be done,” he said in the video.

The Broward Sheriff's Office Division of Internal Affairs is investigating the incident. Deputy Christopher Krickovich, who was one of the deputies involved, has been placed on restricted administrative assignment.

Broward County Mayor Mark Bogen released a statement Friday saying a Broward County Sheriff's Office deputy who was captured on cellphone video banging a 15-year-old boy's head into the ground during an arrest should be fired. ""The behavior of these Broward Sheriff's Office deputies was outrageous and unacceptable,"" said Bogen. ""The officer who jumped on the student, punched the student and banged his head to the ground should be fired immediately. There is no excuse for a law enforcement officer to harm a teenager who was on the ground and who gave no resistance. I also have a problem with the deputy who threw the student to the ground after he pepper sprayed him. After being sprayed, the teen held his face and walked away. If the deputy wanted to arrest the student, he could have easily done so without throwing him to the ground. I hope the appropriate authorities investigate this conduct and take the appropriate action.""

""His family is very upset as to what happened to him.""Della Fera's client and another teen were arrested in the incident.

612,Charge downgraded for teen who got head slammed into ground by deputy,"BROWARD COUNTY, Fla. - A 15-year-old boy who was arrested Thursday after he was pepper sprayed and his head was slammed into the ground by Broward Sheriff's Office deputies appeared in court Friday, where one of the charges against him was downgraded.

The teen was originally arrested on charges of aggravated assault against a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest without violence and trespassing.

The teen's attorney argued in court that there was no probable cause for the aggravated assault charge, and the judge agreed to downgrade to a simple assault charge.

The judge, however, said there was a struggle during the incident outside a McDonald's in Tamarac and the teen tried to get his arm free, hence the resisting arrest charge.

The teen, who has no prior history with the criminal justice system, was released after the hearing to his mother.

The incident between the teen and deputy was captured on cellphone video by a group of teens who told Local 10 News they had gathered at the McDonald's after school to watch two teens fight.

Two other deputies then jump in, one of them banging the teen's face on the pavement and punching his head.

The teen and another teen were ultimately arrested.

A man who witnessed the incident told Local 10 News he believed the deputies went ""way too far.""

The Broward Sheriff's Office has not released the identities of the deputies involved in the incident and it's unclear whether they will be reprimanded.

613,Woman charged in toddler's death,"A woman is facing charges in the death of an 18-month-old boy.



The boy died last November at St. Mary's Medical Center. According to West Pam Beach Police, the medical examiner ruled the cause of death as complications of a ""spinal cord injury."" The report said the boy suffered the injury from being ""struck in the back at the base of the neck with a belt.""

Police arrested 25-year-old Stephanie Michelle Robinson on a charge of child neglect causing great harm. Robinson initially said the boy suffered the facial injuries from falling at the park and in her back yard. She also claimed her paramour may have caused some of the injuries.

Police said she failed to make ""a reasonable effort to protect the victim from abuse and neglect by violating safety plans implemented to protect the victim, by allowing the victim's abuser to care for the victim,"" and ""by providing false information to law enforcement."" The ""abuser"" is not named in the police report, however, police said Robinson allowed the 18-month-old boy to be around the abuser for several months beginning in August, which violated a safety plan agreed to by Robinson in June 2018. The report from the Critical Incident Rapid Response Team (CIRRT) said the boy was left in the care of his mother's paramour in the months prior to his death.



Investigators said the victim's multiple injuries are consistent with physical abuse. CPT investigators also noted ""a pattern of this child being endangered.""

DCF Secretary Chad Poppell issued this statement.

I cannot imagine the pain this precious child experienced in his short life, nor the pain this family is still feeling after his loss. I was outraged when I learned about this case and we will continue to support law enforcement to ensure those responsible for his death are brought to justice.



Poppell said DCF acted to address the ""acute and systemic issues identified in this case."" They're included in the CIRRT report below.

614,2 boys nearly drown in hotel pools,"- Orange County Fire Rescue responded to two near drowning Wednesday afternoon at two different hotel pools near the amusement parks.

They say the first call came in at around 1:30 at a Sheraton on Apopka Vineland Road, where a six-year-old boy almost drowned. Orange County officials say a bystander, who happened to be a nurse, stepped in to help and revived the boy.

A father was vacationing at the Sheraton with his daughter. They were by the water slide, when he said he realized a child was in trouble.

""I was sitting at the pool with my seven-year-old daughter, and I heard a woman say someone is drowning,"" said Jeff Rodrigues.

He looked over and saw that the child's mother was completely calm, as she told him her six-year-old boy was drowning.

""I saw a lifeless body at the bottom of the pool in front of her feet. Immediately jumped in and swam to the bottom.""

It all happened in the deep end of the pool at the Sheraton.

""I'm a short guy, so the pool depth is a little more than my height so, as I was swimming and hoisting him up, it was a pretty good effort to get him to the side. I'm a pretty good swimmer, but it's pretty difficult to swim with someone above your head.""

When he finally got to the edge of the pool, he said other hotel patrons came and assisted with CPR.

""I checked his pulse, he had no pulse. And as CPR was about to get started, he spit up some water, so we put him on the side and gave him some back thrusts. He opened his eyes and progressively got better.""

Paramedics arrived and took the child to the hospital. While this is the first rescue for Rodrigues, he admits he was mentally prepared, he serves as a law enforcement officer in Maryland, who happened to be in Orlando.

""At the right place, at the right time,"" he said. ""We decided to take a break from Disney today.""

The other near drowning happened less than an hour-and-a-half later, three miles away at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club on Arrezzo Way, where a five-year-old boy almost drowned, but a bystander stepped in to help. Orange County Fire Rescue says the bystander was Dr. Jordan Weinstein, a cardiologist on vacation from Chicago. The boy was revived.

Both boys were taken to nearby hospitals and are expected to be okay.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/2-boys-nearly-drown-in-hotel-pools,2019-04-18T04:09:14Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

BEND, Ore. (AP) — The father of a 1-year-old boy who was left outside in central Oregon with a broken leg, cracked skull and meth in his system has accepted a plea deal that will send him to prison for over two years.

Brandon Blouin agreed this week to enter an Alford plea to criminal mistreatment, endangering the welfare of a minor and felon in possession of body armor.

In exchange, charges of custodial interference, child neglect and abandonment of a child were dismissed.

Under the plea, Blouin’s lawyer acknowledged that prosecutors had sufficient evidence to prove the charges.

Authorities say Blouin and the child’s mother took the boy from his legal guardian in West Virginia. Authorities say Blouin allegedly told authorities he’d set the child down in the woods outside Bend but couldn’t find him.

618,Report: School expels girl for kicking boy who entered the girls' bathroom,"- A female student has been expelled from school after kicking a boy in the groin who she says came in the girls' bathroom and blocked the door.

According to the Anchorage Daily News, a group of seven teenage boys entered the girls' bathroom at North Pole High School in Alaska in protest because a transgender student, who identifies as a boy, took a selfie in the boys' bathroom.

""On April 4, a group of male students began to enter the restroom. Only one male student actually proceeded past the door frame,"" said the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District in a statement. ""The other male students followed behind him and were not yet in the restroom. A female student (not the transgender student) was exiting the restroom at the time the first male student began to enter. The female student kicked the first male student in the groin. The male students turned around and left the area.""

The family of the girl said that she was expelled ""indefinitely."" The incident caught the attention of Rep. Tammie Wilson, who is questioning the decision by the school district.

“She is somehow being blamed for this situation when she was the only one where she should’ve been,” said Rep. Tammie Wilson, R-North Pole, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “If you feel threatened, you should be able to defend yourself.”

The school district says all eight student involved in the incident have been disciplined.

""The district does not encourage students or staff to use force against students, staff or visitors to school facilities. In general, we recommend students talk to school staff about any situations in which they feel unsafe.""",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/mobile-app-news-feed/report-school-expels-girl-for-kicking-boy-who-entered-the-girls-bathroom,2019-04-17T15:01:51Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

622,Florida History: Who were the “two Henrys?”,"Florida, our home state, made it out of recessions with the help of leaders. Two of which, happened to be named Henry. Henry Flagler and Henry Bradley Plant are the ""two Henry's.""

Q: Who were the “two Henrys?”

At the end of the 19th century, Florida leaders figured it out. Tourism was a sweet gig. It wasn’t a tire factory. People came down and when they went home, all they left behind were their dirty bath towels and their money. Just the thing to get Florida out of various recessions.

Then someone thought it would be even better if people moved here. The state took advantage of that and wooed developers. Two men, both coincidentally named Henry, leaped at this opportunity and forever changed Florida.

Henry Bradley Plant started as a cabin boy for a New York-area steamboat line. He later relocated to Georgia and expanded rail lines throughout the south. He was drawn to Florida and would lay some 1,200 miles of track.

Plant spent $2 million – more than $50 million in 2018 dollars – to build an iconic hotel that would exploit America’s then-fascination with “Moorish revival” architecture and be called the Tampa Bay Hotel. He topped each of the 13 minarets, cupolas and domes with a crescent moon. His wife traveled the world and spent another $1 million on furnishings that filled 80 boxcars.

The hotel opened in April 1891. Some 2,000 people from the cream of society came. They were treated to a grand salon, two ballrooms, two reading rooms, a billiard room, a “gentleman’s bar,” grand dining rooms and sitting rooms. Each of the 511 hotel rooms had both electricity and new-fangled telephones.

Three years later, in April 1894, in Palm Beach, Henry Morrison Flagler opened the doors to his Royal Poinciana.

Flagler, son of a minister, had been the second-in-command at Standard Oil and one of America's wealthiest men. Around 1877, his wife, Mary Harkness, was ill with tuberculosis, so he took her on the long steamboat journey to balmy St. Augustine. She died four years later. In 1893, Flagler who was 55-years-old married his wife’s longtime nurse and came back to St. Augustine for his honeymoon. He decided to build a hotel that would become the $2.5 million, four story, 450-room Hotel Ponce de Leon.

To encourage Flagler to move his railroad farther south, the state offered 8,000 acres for every mile of track laid south of Daytona Beach. At the time, the southern peninsula might as well have been Mars; fewer than 1,000 people lived between the St. Lucie River and Key West.

Flagler first visited Palm Beach, clandestinely, in 1892 and returned to say he had found “a veritable paradise.'' He eventually would buy about 140 acres for $300,000. He then built yet another hotel: the Royal Poinciana.

The hotel opened Feb. 11, 1894. It had cost nearly a million dollars. A thousand workers and artisans labored on it completing it in only nine months. It was advertised as the largest wooden structure in the world. Soon the railroad extended to Palm Beach.

In a fishing village a little farther south, a lady named Julia Tuttle was pestering Flagler to keep the tracks going. The famous story tells how she gave one of his captains a box of orange blossoms to show her area was frost-free. The real deal-closer was Tuttle’s promise of about half her property. That became Downtown Miami.

Women in Florida history: 15 women, 15 moments

Henry Flagler had one last accomplishment in mind: the monumental task of building a 128-mile-long oversea railroad to link the mainland with Key West. The railroad cost Flagler $20 million; two-fifths of his total Florida investment. Detractors called it `Flagler's Folly.' But in 1912, after seven years of work by 3,000 to 4,000 men, a stooped and weak Flagler made a triumphant entrance to a frenzied Key West. The next year, Flagler died at 83.

From a reader: Thank you for creating this news! I love History and specially history about where I live. I have lived in Florida 20 years and one of the reasons I moved to Palm Coast was that it was very near the oldest city in the United States. I have read every book published about Henry Flagler, he was an amazing man, who fulfilled his destiny at a time, just in time to create Florida as a wonderful state! Starting with St. Augustine and ending with Key West, he was a progressive thinker who knew how to get things done! I will love reading about the creation and development of our great state!

623,"Florida men shot at children, shouted racial slurs at them, deputies say","LAKE COUNTY, Fla. (WESH) - Two men are facing hate crime charges after deputies said they yelled racial slurs and then fired shots at two children near Leesburg.

Officials with the Lake County Sheriff’s Office said James Reidnauer and Brent van Besein fired shots at a 16-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl as they were walking home from a convenience store.

According to an arrest affidavit, it started when the children took a shortcut on their way home from the store. Reidnauer asked what they were doing and the boy responded that they were just walking home.

The children said Reidnauer then fired a shot into the ground and van Besien used a racial slur and fired a shotgun near where they were standing.

The kids ran home and told their mother, who called the police.

Reidnauer told deputies he had fired a warning shot at “two meth heads walking through the area because they were acting suspiciously.”

Both men denied using racial slurs.

They are facing hate crime charges of aggravated battery with a firearm.

627,Jacksonville police investigating shooting of 2-year-old girl,"JACKSONVILLE — Jacksonville police say a 2-year-old girl is expected to recover after being shot and wounded Friday night at a Northside home.

The toddler, whose name wasn’t released, sustained a gunshot wound to the foot that is non-life-threatening, said Lt. Shawn Coarsey of the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

She is the second 2-year-old shot within two months in Jacksonville, according to Times-Union records.

Coarsey said three adults, twin 2-year-old girls and a 6-year-old boy were inside a home in the 100 block of East 44th Street when the shooting happened shortly before 9 p.m. Police were called about 9:10 p.m. when the mother of the injured girl took her to UF Health Jacksonville, he said.

“Thankfully, it’s non-life-threatening. Obviously, it’s a tragedy when a child gets shot,” Coarsey said. Detectives hadn’t determined whether one of the children accidentally fired the gun, he said.

Coarsey said the adults heard a gunshot and ran into a front bedroom where they found the girl wounded. About that time, the child’s parents arrived, scooped her up and took her to the hospital, he said.

He said it was too early in the investigation to say who fired the gun or owned it. Detectives were interviewing the people inside the home when the shooting happened, Coarsey said.

The victim’s mother and grandmother live at the home with an adult family friend. The friend and his girlfriend were at the house when the shooting happened, Coarsey said.

In a separate case, Jayden James Piedra died Feb. 11 after accidentally shooting himself inside a Jammes Road apartment on the Westside.

Police have said Jayden, his 7-year-old brother and their mother were visiting her boyfriend — who lived at the apartment — when the shooting happened.

The Sheriff’s Office subsequently arrested Jayden’s 29-year-old mother, Donna Anteonette Crump-Piedra, on two counts of child neglect and two more of culpable negligence involving a firearm. Her boyfriend, Lephabion Emaul Griggs, 25, was arrested on charges of culpable negligence/improperly stored gun and violation of probation.

The Sheriff’s Office said the loaded gun had been left out on a table as Crump-Piedra and Griggs slept on a couch. The brothers were playing with the weapon when Jayden shot himself, according to the Sheriff’s Office.

The Sheriff’s Office also said the gun previously had been reported stolen, and investigators are looking into how Griggs had possession of it.

(Photo: TIM SHORTT/ FLORIDA TODAY)

Everyone knows Washington D.C. is a mess. Sadly, the temperament in D.C. is being mimicked in Tallahassee and the Viera Government Center. The disrespectful tone and actions of elected officials toward each other and even constituents are appalling.

Tallahassee is no different as legislators lie to each other and the public about the impact of bills and then, through missives and social media posts, even go as low as to name call constituents that happen to disagree or point out flaws in legislation, as state Rep. Randy Fine has done.

In Viera, Commissioner Bryan Lober, in particular, is known for his vindictive actions from the dais and on social media. Aggressive rebuttals in commission meetings are common, and he has even made sure dissenting citizen posts are known to the person’s employer.

There is a level of decorum and professionalism missing in politics these days and it’s degrading to the institutions we elect to serve us. These officials need to grow up and be statesmen for a change.

Freedom of speech under attack

The Florida House, already a Second Amendment antagonist after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas School Safety Act, is 118-0 wrong on freedom of speech.

House Bill 741, which requires schools and universities to treat anti-Semitism the same way as racism when prohibiting discrimination, is clearly an infringement on freedom of speech.

And just like the school safety act, claims that the bills do not infringe on the United States Constitution or that of Florida are campaigning tactics to limit dissenting thought and trap legislators into bad votes. This bill would also endanger our colleges and lower the threshold for labeling students as racist for speaking opinions or even the truth.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said last week the role of a university is not to shield students from speech that would make them uncomfortable. The governor is right. And the role of the Legislature is to protect those freedoms and ensure they are not infringed.

Let’s hope the governor remembers that with a veto pen when he gets HB 741 on his desk.

Justified jewel kick?

A transgender student in Alaska went into a school boys’ restroom and took a selfie that was posted to social media. The boys in the school were a bit miffed by this and decided they would return the favor, so seven of them marched to a girls’ restroom to accomplish the task.

As the seven arrived and began to enter, a female student was exiting the facility, but was blocked from leaving by the first boy coming in. Imagine being a girl and your perception is that seven boys are trapping you in the girls’ room.

How would you react?

You got it, she kicked him in the groin and the remaining boys scattered as if Batman had just arrived and thwarted their evil plans. All were disciplined, but the girl was suspended indefinitely for the violence. Whoa! She was being blocked from leaving in what could have been an attack.

This school needs to reevaluate what happened and look at the girl’s perspective.

632,Local mom battling cancer posts Facebook plea for breast milk,"Local mom battling cancer posts Facebook plea for breast milk Video

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) - Jessica Purcell is one tough mama.

She's a captain in the United States Army. She's served overseas on mutiple deployments in places like Afghanistan and Qatar.

She's faced dangerous situations before.

But, it was her battle here at home with breast cancer where she found herself fighting for her life and the life of her newborn son.

""I just knew ultimately, this is God's will, God's way. Somehow, some way, it will, we can do this,"" she said, cradling her 5-week-old baby boy.

He is her miracle.

When Jessica was nine weeks pregnant, doctors gave her devastating news.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer.

For this St.Petersburg mom who served in the military, perserverance and positivity became her ammo in battling the disease.

""We got this, somehow it's going to work out,"" she said with a sigh and a smile. ""Just keep the faith. Keep your hope. It's so mental.""

Jessica would need that mental strength and toughness as she endured a mastectomy and 12 rounds of grueling chemotherapy, all while pregnant.

At the same time, she and her husband were also raising their little girl, nearly 2-years-old.

""Just going through chemo alone is hard, being pregnant is hard. But, going through both, I just, you would never imagine doing that,"" she told us.

She explained how terrfiying it was to face chemotherapy while carrying her son. She says she sought multiple opinions from top oncologists all over the country and coupled their findings with extensive research she performed on her own.

She says she was told if she didn't seek chemotherapy treatment, she would most likely not survive to see her son or raise her daughter.

She recalled the fear and cripipling anxiety she felt wondering what her future held.

Jessica relied on her faith, friends, familly and support groups comprised of other moms going through similar circumstances

Then, came the joyous moment.

She gave birth to a healthy baby boy in March.

But, because she couldn't breast feed, Jessica wanted to give her little guy a boost to his immune system.

A jump-start for baby Jameson.

So, she posted a plea on Facebook for breast milk.

""I'm like, 'oh my goodness,'"" Jessica told us with a wide grin. ""This is, you know I mean. I have offers coming from around the world now, just to ship from other countires. I literally thought just the girls in St. Pete, maybe Tampa, would be a stretch.""

The mother of two says she's still in shock that her goal went global.

For now, she's focusing on feeding her son with donated breast milk from local moms and familiar faces. She says some moms have paid for extensive bloodwork when offering their milk, while others are close friends in which she has a history.

""It's wonderful, it's overwhelming. My freezer is full, I can actually feed my little guy,"" she said.

Jessica says she's pleasantly overhwhelmed with the love and support she's received worldwide.

It has warmed her heart and strengthened her mama bear spirit.

""I'm more excited than anything, I'm just so blessed,"" she told us. ""My little guy, he's here, just a breath of fresh air.""

Jessica has more final chemo treatment, then will soon begin radiation. She says her nurses at Moffitt Cancer Center keep her going, as does her moms' group.

""They're angels to me!""",http://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/local-mom-battling-cancer-posts-facebook-plea-for-breast-milk/1937701030,2019-04-19T03:28:58Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

Longtime Tampa Bay sports broadcaster Justin Pawlowski, who spent years on local sports talk radio and broadcast from Bulls and Bucs football games, was arrested Wednesday on charges that he tried to solicit a 14-year-old boy.

Pawlowski, 37, faces charges of charges of transmitting harmful material to a minor, using a computer device to solicit a minor and unlawful use of a two-way communication device. The arrest warrants were issued in Hillsborough County.

He was taken into custody at a St. Petersburg address by Pinellas sheriff’s deputies and booked into the Pinellas County jail at 8:54 a.m. Wednesday, records show. He was freed more than 8 hours later after posting $6,000 bail.

Pawlowski sent an explicit photo of himself to “what he believed to be a 14-year-old boy,” according to Tampa police. “The defendant also expressed interest in meeting with the child on several occasions,” police said, to engage in sexual acts.

Police did not say whether Pawlowski allegedly solicited an actual 14-year-old or an officer posing as one. No other details about the case were released. The arrest warrants were not available on Wednesday.

Pawlowski was an offensive lineman at Tampa Catholic High School who signed to play football for the University of Connecticut in 2000. He returned to Tampa to finish his degree at the University of South Florida and start his broadcasting career, according to his online bio. He became known as “The Commish” while broadcasting about fantasy football.

He worked at sports radio station WDAE-AM 620, going from promotions to executive producer to hosting his own show, his bio said. In 2007 he started working as the pre- and post-game radio show host for football games on the Bulls Radio Network until 2017. In 2011 he went to work for the Buccaneers Radio Network for two seasons.

Most recently, Pawlowski produced his own podcast, Bucs Uncensored, which aired on JoeBucsFan.com. However, JoeBucsFan.com said he has never been an employee there and oversaw the sponsorship deals for his own podcast. His latest episode, No. 392, was about the NFL draft and posted Wednesday, the day of his arrest.

641,Orlando-area first responders serve up kindness instead of warrants,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Law enforcement officers and other first responders across Central Florida are going beyond the call of duty each week, and our team at News 6 loves to share the ways they're getting results in their communities.

Whether it is to crime victims and their families, animals in need or even each other, our first responders are always lending a helping hand.

When you see your hero, you obviously have to take a picture with them, right? That was the case this week when a little boy saw an Ormond Beach police officer in his apartment complex and the officer stayed to snap a photo with him. Of course, the little boy had his own toy police gear to show the officer how much he admired his line of work. The Ormond Beach Police Department later shared the special moment on social media.

The Lake County Sheriff's Office is helping inmates stay busy and get results for a good cause while they serve their time. Through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Lake-Sumter, inmates are building homes for those who need them, after getting a few lessons on how to form a slab from Bay to Bay Concrete. After seeing some pictures, you could say their first day on the job was pretty productive.

All lives matter to members of the St. Cloud Fire Department, including those of five baby kittens that were trapped in a storm drain last week. The department shared pictures of the rescue on Facebook with the good news that -- despite getting a little dirty -- all five kittens were safely removed and cared for.

Flagler County deputies set out to teach the importance of safety over the weekend at their first annual safety expo. Pictures and a summary of the event posted on Facebook show the community responded, with more than 1,000 local residents and children showing up to get involved. Deputies are already looking forward to next year's event.

It wouldn't be our weekly tradition of first responders getting results in their communities if we didn't include a turtle rescue, would it? Officer Gerardi, with the Winter Park Police Department, thought outside the box (get it?) to keep a special turtle safe. Gerardi nicknamed his new friend Teddy the Turtle.

#MondayMood 😊#WPPD's Ofc Gerardi took the time to keep this little guy safe🐢 - affectionately named 'Teddy the Turtle'. 😊 pic.twitter.com/ADd5BxVUCm — Winter Park Police (@WinterParkPD) April 15, 2019

643,"Naked boy found wandering Palm Bay neighborhood with pit bull, police say","PALM BAY, Fla. - A Palm Bay woman was arrested Saturday after a naked boy was found wandering around a neighborhood, officials said.

Taylor Brown was arrested on a child neglect charge.

According to Palm Bay police, a concerned citizen called officers after noticing the child walking around the 1500 block of Main Street with a pit bull.

The boy's age was not released by police, but officers said he was too young to identify his home, according to police.

Police said officers canvassed the neighborhood to find anyone who could identify the child. An officer talked to Brown, who said she passed out in a bathtub after drinking a quarter bottle of Bacardi, according to police.

Officers said Brown did not seem worried that the boy was not home. It's not known how long the boy, who had abrasions on his ribs, was alone, police said.

According to Palm Bay police, Brown has had two previous incidents in connection with child neglect.

Brown was arrested and taken to jail.

646,"Florida community pays $85,000 for iconic underwater photos","Bruce Mozert's iconic underwater photography captured the days before Disney and Universal Studios, when Silver Springs was Florida's hot-spot tourist destination.

OCALA — Bruce Mozert, the pioneer of underwater photography, was known more for his stunning pictures than his organization skills.

Mozert, 98, died in October 2015 and left behind a treasure trove of history in his photography studio near Silver Springs State Park.

Inside the studio, there were about a dozen of his original underwater camera housings that he used to snap his first underwater photos in Silver Springs in the 1930s.

Hundreds of decades-old prints depicting movie stars and movie sets were found stacked throughout the studio. Thousands of negatives, some from nearly 90 years ago, were found stuffed in drawers and sometimes mixed with personal vacation images.

The collection captures the days before Disney and Universal Studios, when Silver Springs was ""the"" tourist attraction in Florida.

Despite his iconic connection to Marion County, it was uncertain if his collection would remain here. Soon after Mozert's death, his relatives shopped the collection around, trying to find a buyer.

A local group of concerned citizens began meeting with elected officials and others to fight for the collection. Now, after more than a year of negotiations, Marion County government and the College of Central Florida have teamed with the state Division of Library and Information Services to purchase the collection from Mozert's family for $85,000.

Lois Brauckmuller, CF spokeswoman, said the state paid $42,500 to the family and guaranteed that all of his negatives would be digitally archived. The county and the college each paid $21,250 and can access the digital archive to make prints. The equipment will be stored in Tallahassee and displayed when needed.

Michelle Stone, chair of the Marion County Commission, said preserving the collection was an important mission. Stone said that it was important for the community to keep the collection together.

Stone said the state will digitally archive the photos for anyone to view. The county and CF will have access to print copies.

""He was the first underwater photographer and his work was right here in Marion County,"" Stone noted. ""We didn't want it sold off and split up all over the world.""

CF President Jim Henningsen said the Appleton Museum of Art, which is operated by CF, will one day soon showcase Mozert's camera housings and 20 or so of his iconic photos that were hand colored and autographed by the legend. The exhibit has not been scheduled.

""We are fortunate the family decided to sell so that it (collection) could be preserved for our community,"" Henningsen said.

Since the acquisition of the Mozert collection, Marion County government will be the first to display some of his work. The agency decided to display six of Mozert's framed iconic photographs during Marion County's 175th anniversary celebration, scheduled for 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at the McPherson Governmental Complex, 601 NE 25th Ave., Ocala.

Nick Zoller, a Marion County spokesman, said the six framed photographs will be on display at the Marion County tourism booth.

The subjects of Mozert's framed pictures are:

Lady sunning on the grassy banks of Silver Springs with a passing glass-bottom boat Aerial view of the swimming platform with glass-bottom boats in the background Lady underwater laying on the sand using a rotary phone Two ladies underwater holding a ""Greetings from Silver Springs"" sign Lady playing golf underwater from the ""9th hole water trap"" A diver using the underwater camera and housing to capture images.

Mozert spent 30 years as Silver Springs' official photographer. He designed and built an underwater camera housing in the 1930s when ""Tarzan"" movies were being filmed at the park. He made a camera housing from Plexiglas, sheet metal and soldering wire. It was pieced together using a few nails and screws.

During an interview with the Star-Banner in 2013, two years before his death, Mozert shared the story of the day he first explored the concept of underwater photography.

""I saw that crystal clear water and that's how I got into my underwater work,"" Mozert said. ""I went out in the backyard of Silver Springs one morning after I had made the camera case and I found an old inner tube. That was back when they were made out of real rubber. I fitted it on my arm and my arm fit tight. I attached it to the housing and took it down in the water. (""Tarzan"" star) Johnny Weissmuller was there. They all laughed at me, but all 12 pictures came out clear. They ended up sending them to Hollywood.""

During Mozert's career at Silver Springs, he shot photos of such notables as Gregory Peck, Lloyd Bridges and Jane Wyman.

""The photos I shot of Jayne Mansfield went worldwide,"" Mozert said in 2013. ""She was nobody until she came to Silver Springs, and boy did she play up the photography.""

And the legend of Bruce Mozert was born.

In 2016, a year after his death, the Appleton showcased more than 100 iconic images, many of which were Mozert's.

The exhibit was called ""Paradise Park Remembered: Photographs by Bruce Mozert and Others."" For 20 years until 1969, Mozert photographed visitors of Paradise Park, which was the African-American version of Silver Springs before integration.

649,Resort workers revive Florida 3-year-old with CPR after child falls into hot tub,"(WESH) - Two resort workers are credited with saving the life of a 3-year-old boy who nearly drowned Sunday night in a hot tub in Daytona Beach Shores, Florida.

A desk clerk, who was watching surveillance video from the lobby, saw the boy step into the hot tub and fall under the water.

The desk clerk radioed another staff member, who was able to pull the boy from the water and begin performing CPR.

An investigation into the incident revealed that 3-year-old twin boys were in the hot tub with their mother and father. As the pool was closing, the father left the children in the care of their mother while he gathered the family's belongings.

The mother was arrested and charged with child neglect after investigators said she admitted to consuming alcohol, marijuana, oxycodone and suboxone prior to the incident.

659,'It's fun to win',"PACE — When Nate Golmon decided to be a wrestler, he envisioned himself flying through the air after jumping from the turnbuckle post and delivering a flying kick to his opponent's head — just like in the World Wrestling Federation.

He was in for a surprise and so were the wrestlers he competed against. Last Wednesday, with family and friends gathered around him, Golmon signed a letter of intent to attend the University of North Carolina at Pembroke on a wrestling scholarship.

""I thought it was the coolest thing,"" Nate Golmon said when he found out what real wrestling was about. ""It's fun to win.""

Golmon wrestled in the 160-pound weight class in high school. As a junior, he placed second at State for Tate High School, a record finish for a wrestler at that school.

In his senior year, Golmon transferred to Pace High School and set a record there placing third in State. His season record this year is 55-3.

Golmon also led Pace to a district team championship and a traditional team title — the first time any school in our area has accomplished winning both championships. Golmon was also named Region One North West Florida Wrestler of the Year for 2019 by coaches and referees.

""He is a good fit with the program,"" Golmon's mother, Kerri said of UNCP.

Coach Reggie Allen agrees with Golmon's Mother. It was coach Allen who encouraged Golmon go to UNCP. Allen's son wrestled and graduated from Pembroke.

""I sent him a boy and he came back a man,"" Allen said about his son's experience at UNCP. Pembroke's head coach Othello Johnson, is a man of his word Allen said.

When Allen's son was injured and the possibility he would never wrestle again existed, Johnson called Allen and assured him his son would keep his scholarship.

""I recruited your son for the whole person,"" Johnson told Allen.

That kind of attitude sold Golmon to the school. He liked the fact that his coaches were interested in developing the whole person.

""The coaching staff said they cared about me becoming a better person and if I happen to become a great wrestler, well that's good, too,"" Golmon said.

Golmon will study education at Pembroke. He hopes to become a teacher and coach.

Golmon's 12-year-old brother Phillip is his biggest fan. Phillip Golmon was born with Dandy-Walker Syndrome that affects his learning, speech and balance. Phillip loves to watch his brother wrestle.

""He (Nate) is the most amazing big brother,"" Kerri said. ""All he wants to do is make him (Phillip) proud.""

During his signing ceremony, Golmon thanked everyone that helped him get to where he is.

""I'm just going to go there and do the best I can do,"" he said.",https://www.srpressgazette.com/news/20190419/its-fun-to-win?rssfeed=true,2019-04-19T09:57:24Z,Santa Rosas Press Gazette,Couple,"6576 Caroline St, Milton, FL 32570, USA",FL,32570
660,Columbine survivors are helping others affected by massacres,"In this March 23, 2019, file photo, Columbine survivor Heather Martin reflects about the upcoming 20th anniversary of the mass shooting at her high school in Littleton, Colo.

PARKLAND, Fla. (AP) - Alex Rozenblat can still hear the cries of a wounded boy calling for help as she hid from the gunfire that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year.

Talking to therapists at the school in Parkland, Florida, didn't help. Each session had a different counselor, and she found herself rehashing traumas she had already expressed. She would rather turn to her friends, who understand what she went through.

""There is slight pressure to get better as quickly as you can, and since it's been a year, everyone thinks that you are better,"" the 16-year-old said.

The mental health resources after a school shooting range from therapy dogs and grief counselors at school to support groups, art therapy and in-home counseling. But there is no blueprint for dealing with the trauma because each tragedy, survivor and community is different. Many survivors don't get counseling right away - sometimes waiting years - making it difficult to understand the full impact.

The struggle is getting them to seek help in the first place. In the two decades since the Columbine High School massacre, a network of survivors has emerged, reaching out to the newest victims to offer support that many say they prefer to traditional therapy.

As the anguish festers, the danger grows, illustrated by the recent suicides of two Marjory Stoneman Douglas survivors and a father whose young child died in the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut.

""It changes the community,"" said psychologist Robin Gurwitch, a trauma specialist at Duke University Medical Center.

Grief, troubling memories and emotions can bubble up any time for survivors and even community members who didn't see the bullets fly, she said. They can hit on anniversaries of the tragedy, birthdays of victims, graduations and new mass shootings, Gurwitch said. The trauma can even rush back with a song, favorite meal, video game or fire alarms.

""There's never a time limit. We don't get 'over it.' We hope we learn to get through it and cope,"" Gurwitch said.

Survivors of the Columbine attack, which killed 12 Colorado students and a teacher on April 20, 1999, started The Rebels Project, which is part of a loose nationwide network of survivors of mass attacks.

The groups reach out after each shooting. They held a packed meeting for survivors and parents in Parkland this month, describing how they have learned to cope over the years through therapy, exercise and hobbies and assuring the Florida community that their pain is normal.

""We are one family,"" said meeting organizer Mike Dempsey, a survivor of 9/11 and the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. ""What helped me after 9/11 was that Oklahoma City bombing survivors drove all the way up to New York to help us. They weren't mental health professionals, but they were able to offer comfort and outreach and just to let us know: 'We've been through this.'""

Rozenblat refuses to talk about the Parkland shooting. If she feels anxious during the school day, she holes up in a TV production classroom because there are no windows for a gunman to shoot through.

Her mother worries. Alex had been an honors student but now struggles with schoolwork. She's also started hanging around a new group of friends, said her mother, Lissette Rozenblat.

She schedules therapy appointments, but Alex often makes excuses to postpone or cancel. The family bought a therapy dog and is trying to get Alex into art therapy.

""The common theme among parents ... almost all of our kids don't want to talk about the incident,"" Lissette Rozenblat said.

Some students who were not physically wounded minimize their trauma and don't seek help because they try to convince themselves they were lucky, said Columbine survivor Heather Martin, who co-founded The Rebel Project.

""You can't measure trauma in that way,"" Martin said. Still, she said people need to seek help when they feel ready, not when others think they should.

Victims often receive compensation for longer-term care, but many in recovering communities, especially those may have seen horror but avoided injury, say there's still not enough help to go around.

Stoneman Douglas math teacher Kimberly Krawczyk said no typical school counselor - no matter how well-intentioned or trained - can fully help students or staff who survived a mass shooting.

""These kids have seen as much as soldiers who have been in battle. They survived gunfire. They walked over bodies. They had classmates who were right next to them who got shot,"" Krawczyk said.

Teachers also are dealing with their own trauma and insecurities, she said.

""We don't all have our marbles back in our bags yet, but we are in charge of those children. That gravity is a lot of responsibility, and for some teachers, it is too emotionally overwhelming,"" Krawczyk said.

Managing long-term mental health effects poses unique challenges in each town touched by tragedy, but experts agree that isolation is a red flag and keeping victims connected to family, friends and community is critical.

Dr. April Foreman, a psychologist on the board of the American Association of Suicidology, called treating mass shootings ""a profound lifetime health care issue"" but stressed that a majority of those who have suicidal thoughts recover.

Marjory Stoneman sophomore Julia Brighton said she's attempted suicide four times in the year since she watched the gunman shoot through the window of her English class, killing three friends. Despite an outpouring of community support and a bevy of mental health services, Brighton said she still felt ashamed to seek help.

After months of therapy, she said she realized ""there's nothing to be afraid of because it made me a better person in the long run.""

663,Famed Tampa Bay sportscaster accused of soliciting 14-year-old for sex,"Longtime Tampa Bay sports broadcaster Justin Pawlowski, who spent years on local sports talk radio and broadcast from Bulls and Bucs football games, was arrested Wednesday on charges that he tried to solicit a 14-year-old boy.

Pawlowski, 37, faces charges of charges of transmitting harmful material to a minor, using a computer device to solicit a minor and unlawful use of a two-way communication device. The arrest warrants were issued in Hillsborough County.

He was taken into custody at a St. Petersburg address by Pinellas sheriff’s deputies and booked into the Pinellas County jail at 8:54 a.m. Wednesday, records show. He was freed more than 8 hours later after posting $6,000 bail.

Pawlowski sent an explicit photo of himself to “what he believed to be a 14-year-old boy,” according to Tampa police. “The defendant also expressed interest in meeting with the child on several occasions,” police said, to engage in sexual acts.

Police did not say whether Pawlowski allegedly solicited an actual 14-year-old or an officer posing as one. No other details about the case were released. The arrest warrants were not available on Wednesday.

Pawlowski was an offensive lineman at Tampa Catholic High School who signed to play football for the University of Connecticut in 2000. He returned to Tampa to finish his degree at the University of South Florida and start his broadcasting career, according to his online bio. He became known as “The Commish” while broadcasting about fantasy football.

He worked at sports radio station WDAE-AM 620, going from promotions to executive producer to hosting his own show, his bio said. In 2007 he started working as the pre- and post-game radio show host for football games on the Bulls Radio Network until 2017. In 2011 he went to work for the Buccaneers Radio Network for two seasons.

Most recently, Pawlowski produced his own podcast, Bucs Uncensored, which aired on JoeBucsFan.com. However, JoeBucsFan.com said he has never been an employee there and oversaw the sponsorship deals for his own podcast. His latest episode, No. 392, was about the NFL draft and posted Wednesday, the day of his arrest.

Pat McCourt, a former Bonita Springs city councilor and fire commissioner, died of cancer April 7, city officials said.

The 78-year-old was born in Detroit and served on the Bonita Springs City Council for four years.

""Pat was larger than life, just a wonderful presence,” Councilor Peter O’Flinn said about McCourt at Wednesday evening's City Council meeting. “You sure knew what he felt, and he wasn’t shy about telling you, which was delightful.”

Mayor Peter Simmons said he knew McCourt and visited his family’s stores and shops on Mackinac Island, Michigan. Simmons said he attended McCourt’s St. Patrick’s Day parties.

“You couldn’t have seen a happier Irishman than Pat McCourt down at his house on those St. Patrick’s Day parties,” Simmons said. “Pat, we love you. Thank you for your service to Bonita Springs.”

Simmons said he remembers McCourt’s time as a councilor, although they didn’t serve on the council together.

“It doesn’t matter if you agreed or disagreed with him, he would engage you and you would learn something,” Simmons said. “He had something to offer.”

McCourt was born in Detroit in 1940 and earned an Eagle Scout badge before joining the U.S. Army, according to his obituary.

He served as Scout Executive with the Boy Scouts of America, training scout leaders and organizing troops in the Detroit area.

McCourt then entered the financial sector and ended as vice president at Massachusetts Financial Services.

McCourt was a member of the Bonita Springs City Council from 2006-2010. He went on to serve as a Bonita Springs fire commissioner from 2014-2018.

An investigation into the incident revealed that 3-year-old twin boys were in the hot tub with their mother and father. As the pool was closing, the father left the children in the care of Connolly while he gathered the family's belongings.Moments later, the desk clerk, who was watching the surveillance video from the lobby, saw the twins return to the hot tub. One of the boys then stepped into the middle of the hot tub and went under the water. The desk clerk radioed another staff member, who was able to pull the boy from the water and begin performing CPR. The child eventually began breathing on his own, but he was taken to Arnold Palmer Hospital for further treatment. When officers reviewed the video surveillance footage, they said Connolly could be seen throwing something in the garbage while her son was being resuscitated. Police said they pulled a pill from the trash and Connolly eventually admitted that she was under the influence.

683,Barron Collier grad Nick Denove making college baseball look easy,"Barron Collier graduate Nick Denove was recently named the Division III Rookie of the Week. Denove is a freshman pitcher for Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. (Photo: Submitted photo)

In his first college baseball season, Barron Collier graduate Nick Denove hasn’t needed much of an adjustment period.

Quite contrarily, he’s doing just fine in his freshman year at Division III Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

Denove, the Naples Daily News Baseball Player of the Year as a senior last year, has started his college career in fine fashion. Denove, a left-handed pitcher, is 4-2 with a 2.55 earned run average in eight starts with the Spartans. In 53 innings pitched, he’s allowed 44 hits with 12 walks and 30 strikeouts. In a recent dominant stretch, Denove pitched three straight complete games – including a five-hit shutout against a powerful New York University lineup. For his efforts, he was named the NCAA Division III Rookie of the Week by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association, becoming the first player in program history to receive that distinction.

“Practice-wise, it hasn’t been that much of an adjustment because we always had long practices (at Barron Collier),” Denove said. “But the big thing you notice is that going through the lineup one through nine is tougher than it is in high school. Pretty much everybody in the lineup can hurt you if you don’t make your pitch.”

Denove played a key role on two Barron Collier teams that advanced to the state semifinals, and he said that experience was a big help in getting him ready for the next level.

“I don’t think most high schools practiced the way we practiced at Barron Collier,” he said. “The intensity, the work we put in, that kind of did make it a little easier to adjust.”

Case Western Reserve is well-known as an academic institution, with a highly regarded medical school, business school, law school and dental school helping its sterling reputation. The school is also a leading institution for research in electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering.

“The school work is a big step up from high school,” Denove said. “You really have to stay on top of your work or it can be easy to fall behind. So I guess the biggest challenge is time management, being able to balance the school work with baseball. But so far, it’s going pretty well.”

Denove said he makes good use of the long bus rides and the hotel stays, which provide perfect opportunities to get some work done.

“A 10-hour bus ride can be pretty boring anyway, so you might as well make the most of that time,” he said.

Denove is majoring in mechanical engineering and is on the pre-med track, so his course load is obviously challenging.

The other big adjustment Denove had to make was getting accustomed to the Ohio weather, particularly early in the season. For a Florida boy, that sounds difficult. But Denove has always been a fiery competitor, which has certainly helped.

“The second game I pitched, it was 26 degrees outside,” he said. “To be honest, I didn’t notice it as much when I was pitching. You notice it more in the dugout. But you learn to make some adjustments like wearing long sleeve shirts and finding ways to keep your hands warm. When I’m on the mound, I’m pretty focused on what I’m doing to realize it’s cold, anyway.”

It’s fitting that Denove is pursuing the medical field, because he’s always pitched with pinpoint precision to help offset the lack of a blazing fastball. His heater sits in the low 80s and occasionally touches 85, but he relies on changing speeds and outsmarting the hitter – something he always did with great effect at Barron Collier.

“I’d love to be able to throw harder and get looked at by the pros,” he said. “But realistically speaking, this is where I need to be. That’s one of the biggest reasons I picked (Case Western Reserve). It was an academic decision just as much as a baseball decision.”

684,"After Beyoncé surprise album, Netflix 'Homecoming' documentary may feature familiar FAMU faces","Before the much-anticipated Netflix documentary, “Homecoming: A Film By Beyoncé” was scheduled to start streaming at 3:01 a.m. Wednesday, Don P. Roberts wasn’t quite sure what to expect.

The Queen Bey dropped a surprise 40-track album Wednesday to accompany the documentary, wowing the world and her faithful Beehive of fans.

But the former Marching 100 drum major — chosen by the star’s team to help bring the authentic HBCU culture to her 2018 Coachella concert upon which the film is based — expects it to include glimpses of faces familiar to Florida A&M University alumni.

In a nod to the pop culture icon’s international status – and the total control she commands over her empire — Netflix remained mum on any advance details.

Earlier this month, it did release a trailer, a fast-moving tease of some of the scenes.

Included was snapshot of men wearing FAMU T-shirts, which already has made its way around social media.

USA Today reported it gives “glimpses at Queen Bey and her team's preparation for the performance, set to the words of Maya Angelou.”

""I want to be representative of my race: the human race,"" the late poet and activist can be heard saying. ""I have a chance to show how kind we can be, how intelligent and generous we can be. I have a chance to teach and to love and to laugh. I know that when I finish doing what I'm sent here to do, I will be called home, and I will go home without any fear (or) trepidations wondering what's going to happen.""

Special premier viewings were held Tuesday night at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and Texas Southern University in the star’s hometown of Houston.

Netflix's 'Homecoming' documentary has FAMU ties

The two-hour-plus film captures a behind-the-scenes look at Beyoncé’s groundbreaking 2018 performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.

In it, she exposed the world to homecoming culture at HBCUs, complete with dancers, a nod to Greek life, marching bands and drumlines.

Beyoncé’s affinity for HBCUs stems from her father, who graduated from Fisk University, a private HBCU in Nashville, Tennessee.

The Florida A&M influence was propelled when Beyoncé’s team requested the assistance of Roberts, a FAMU alum and former Marching 100 drum major, who is recognized as one of the country’s most respected music educators.

Roberts attended FAMU from 1980 to 1985, earning his degree in music education. One of his classmates was Shelby Chipman, current professor of music and director of marching and pep bands at the university.

Based in Atlanta, Roberts is CEO of DRUMLine Live, music supervisor for DeKalb County Schools and former band director at Southwest DeKalb High School.

Roberts gained national recognition as executive band consultant for the movie “Drumline,” where he was in charge of working with actors, creating the precision drills and more.

He also served as band consultant for the BET series “The Quad” which which was set on a fictitious black university campus in Atlanta.

DRUMLine Live is an international tour production, including alumni from Florida A&M, Tennessee State, Alabama State and other HBCUs.

Among its members are former FAMU musicians and dancers with campus troupes. Former Marching 100 drum major Slater Thorpe, serves as its show announcer, the same role he snagged for Beyoncé’s Coachella performance.

It was Roberts who was sought after by Beyoncé’s team to help bring the HBCU experience to her Coachella production.

“None of us had a role in the 'Homecoming' Netflix special,” Roberts said. “However, I'm sure you will see most of them in the special.”

Roberts said DRUMLine Live was responsible for securing HBCU-experienced band members to blend in with the group already established by Beyoncé’s team for her performance at Coachella.

“Her musicians were incredible and so were the members of DRUMLine Live,” Roberts said. “They made an extraordinary team that made musical history together. We were not responsible for the steppers and dancers. I selected all members from DRUMLine Live and assisted her musical director with rehearsals. I think our greatest role was bringing true HBCU authenticity to Coachella.”

That was critical, Robert said.

“Going into the project, my biggest concern was being authentic to the HBCU culture,” he said. “I know the Beehive was tough, but I knew if we did not properly pay tribute to the HBCU culture, inclusive of marching band, sororities, and fraternities, we were gonna have to deal with the wrath and scorn of HBCU band heads and alumni worldwide.”

Fortune magazine reported Beyoncé — the first black woman to headline at Coachella — broke viewership records on YouTube, with her HBCU-themed set attracting 458,000 simultaneous global viewers at its peak, making it the most viewed Coachella performance ever.

Her performance included over 100 singers, dancers, and musicians.

“I applaud the Queen and her staff for taking such a huge risk, but also for flawlessly executing what some may have thought was an impossible task,” Roberts said. “She is now a part of HBCU music history forever. I think her impact will be felt in the future by the positive exposure it will bring to the HBCU culture.”

686,Naples brothers return to Haitian hometown to help send children to school,"Golden Gate High School teacher Fortinel Faustin still remembers his childhood in Mare-Rouge, Haiti. His family struggled to send him and his brother, Jhony, to school, but always made it work.

He recalls his parents would try to help other children get access to an education, just like them. In the Faustin house, an education was everything.

""Without an education, you won't even get a seat at the table,"" Jhony Faustin said.

A couple of years ago, Fortinel, 30, and Jhony, 28, returned home to Mare-Rouge, located about 100 miles northwest of Port-au-Prince, the country's capital.

Fortinel Faustin, 29, a social studies teacher at Golden Gate High School, is one of the creators of the nonprofit organization ""The Faustin Project."" Fortinel, along with his brother, Jhony, started a charity for children in Mare-Rouge, Haiti, where they grew up. The charity helps send kids to school and provides needed supplies.

The brothers had not seen Haiti in several years. In search of greater opportunity, their family moved to Southwest Florida in May 2002.

Both of them quickly realized how much ""hopelessness"" was in their birth country. Still recovering from Haiti's 2010 earthquake, the poverty level was very high and many children were not in school.

""We started to brainstorm ideas and ways that we could help,"" Fortinel said. ""We arrived at education because that's highly valued down there in Haiti.""

They decided to help Mare-Rouge children get their seat at the table by founding The Faustin Project in 2018.

The project

Named for their parents, Fortilus and Morilia Faustin, the brothers' project works to help provide scholarships for underprivileged children to attend school in Mare-Rouge.

""When I go there I have meetings with the kids and the parents,"" Fortinel said. ""I've had parents tell me how much it means to them.""

The project secured scholarships for 40 Mare-Rouge children to attend school by raising a couple of thousand dollars, but Jhony said they are just getting started.

The team hopes to provide more than 50 scholarships. The big goal is to open their own school in Mare-Rouge, which Jhony said would fill the greatest void.

""We're actually seeing the kids grow up before our eyes,"" Jhony said. ""The biggest change is watching kids go from being really shy to being really vocal and outgoing with us.""

The project started with selling T-shirts and soon developed to a nonprofit. The project is now partnered with the Rotary Club of Naples and the Enterprise Holdings Foundation.

In February, Golden Gate High School's athletic department donated more than 500 T-shirts to the project, according to their Facebook page.

Fortinel hopes it's just the beginning of the school's involvement. Some of his students have shown interest in aiding the project, which he said could help them develop their own causes.

""Going forward we are going to collaborate more with the students because they are very interested,"" Fortinel said.

Fortinel teaches social studies at Golden Gate High, where he encourages his students to get a world view of other places. He said Haiti is often labeled negatively without context.

In the United States, people don't have a full picture of what it's like in Haiti, who the Haitian people are and why local work is more essential than blind donations, he said.

""That first trip I gave people everything I had as far as money, but that's not a sustainable way of helping,"" Fortinel said.

Haitian roots

When they were students at Lely High School, Fortinel and Jhony dreamed of giving back to the Haitian schools where they got their early education, Fortinel said.

The brothers remember walking the school halls where many of their scholarship students now attend, Jhony said.

""We see both sides and we understand both sides,"" Jhony said. ""The connection we have to back home that's what makes it different from any other nonprofit over there in Haiti.""

Experiencing school in the United State and Haiti helps them understand the gap, he said.

""We grew up in that stuff, so we understand exactly what we need to do to help the community and help those kids for a better future,"" Jhony said.

In Haiti, people are fighting to feed their families, and paying for school is too often a financial burden, Fortinel said. They try to relieve it.

Every summer and any chance he gets throughout the year, Fortinel returns to Haiti. Jhony always follows.

Fortinel said it's hard to describe his experiences going back to Mare-Rouge. Sometimes he just acts on instinct. He recalled seeing a young boy with terrible burns down his back. His aunt, who primarily cared for him, could only afford to put powder on the burns.

Fortinel can still remember the boy's screams, which brought him to tears. The project helped provide him with medical care and now he's full recovered.

He said the Mare-Rouge community is responding positively to their future plans and work.

""They really appreciate what we're doing,"" Jhony said. ""They really support our vision down there.""

Mare-Rouge parents laud praises on the brothers for returning home.

""If this foundation grows, the kids will definitely benefit from more than just their school fees being paid,"" Fortinel said. ""They'll have a normal childhood.""

689,Truck driver accused of kidnapping 2 children gets trial delay,"A federal judge granted a request Tuesday for a trial delay in the case against a truck driver from Jacksonville accused of kidnapping two children from Texas.

Marshall Pendergrass, 47, was indicted in March by a federal grand jury on two counts of kidnapping.

His defense team asked for a delay in the start of the trial, which had been set for May 7, saying they have not yet received evidence in the case.

The prosecution didn't object, and the judge granted the motion, canceling an April 22 status conference and setting a new trial date for July 2.

At his arraignment in Flagstaff, Arizona, Pendergrass pleaded not guilty to all counts and waived formal reading of the indictment, according to the federal court docket. The court hearing lasted two minutes.

Pendergrass was taken into custody March 16 in northern Arizona after authorities said they found two children who used to live in Jacksonville and who were abducted from Texas held captive in the cab of his semi truck.

According to a federal complaint obtained by News4Jax, the 12-year-old boy and his 14-year-old sister told police that they were kidnapped by the Jacksonville truck driver and bound with zip ties and duct tape during their ordeal.

Pendergrass told investigators he learned the children ""ran away"" from home and he said he planned to take them back home, the complaint stated.

Jessica Purcell posted a plea on Facebook, asking for breast milk donations, getting the attention and support of thousands online.

""There are good people out there, and I'm amazed at the Mamas reaching out,"" Purcell told FOX 13 News.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer during her ninth month of pregnancy. Despite the odds, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy five weeks ago.

""I'm still mind blown that it was possible,"" said Purcell who underwent 12 rounds of chemo during her pregnancy.

Because her treatment is still ongoing, Purcell can't breastfeed her son. She's tried getting donations non-profit milk banks but doesn't qualify.

The only accredited milk bank in Florida, Mothers' Milk Bank of Florida, said it prioritizes sick or premature babies over healthy babies that can survive on formula. At the current rate, there aren't enough donors, according to the organization.

Purcell wants to jumpstart her son's immune system and believes breast milk is key.

She's received offers from women all over the country, and although she is extremely appreciative, she is focusing on moms who live in her area.

""So I would be able to meet them personally or at least have a close friend of mine vouch for them,"" she said.

CLEVELAND - A young boy who has been a patient at Cleveland Clinic's Children's Hospital for the past several months is waiting for a new heart, but Saturday he reached a major milestone at his home away from home.

He may not be your typical superhero, but Jaxxon Austin is currently in the fight of his life.

""It takes a really strong person to get through this as an adult, so I can only imagine as a child how much stronger it is because physically, he's the one going through all of it,"" said his mom, Jessica Austin.

Jessica said Jaxxon has been at Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital since December, after being diagnosed with a congenital heart defect.

""Where one of the coronaries or one of the vessels feeding his heart was connected improperly, so it was depriving his heart of the oxygen that it needed,” nurse practitioner Hannah Bostdorff explained.

At just 8 months old, Jaxxon underwent open heart surgery, but it was unsuccessful and followed by a stroke.

""The goal of the open heart surgery was obviously to fix his valve but ultimately, his heart was just too sick to heal itself,"" Austin said.

Jaxxon’s condition has put him at the top of the heart transplant recipient list.

Still hospitalized while waiting for a new heart, he reached a major milestone, celebrating his very first birthday, surrounded by his five siblings, friends and caregivers.

The theme of the party was superheroes. It brought balloons, toys and smiles to the young boy who has touched so many at his home away from home.

""We always tell everybody, 'Jaxxon has family at home and now he's got a hospital family as well.' When you come up here, he's always happy always smiling. It's hard but being in the situation that we're in, I'm just grateful he's being taken care of the way he would at home too,"" Austin said.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/04/15/ohio-boy-celebrates-first-birthday-in-hospital-while-waiting-for-heart-transplant/,2019-04-15T12:34:54Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394

A FedEx driver told investigators that she witnessed the man, identified as Christopher Griffis, 31, yelling at the boy to get out of his car as she walked out of a Belk store on U.S. 1 South, the Sheriff's Office said. The FedEx driver contacted deputies.

The boy told a Department of Children and Families investigator that he was in the car with Griffis, and they were driving to the Anchor Faith School when he got sick, according to the report. He said Griffis pushed him out of the car and drove away.

According to the Sheriff's Office, Griffis admitted to being angry during a recorded phone call and telling the boy to get out. Griffis said he was at the school for about 15 minutes while the boy was left alone outside.

While in the parking lot of the nearby school, deputies said Griffis was in the car with three other children who are ages 1, 5 and 7, the Sheriff's Office said. A deputy said Griffis refused to get out of the car, rolled up his windows and locked his doors.

Before a deputy could breach the driver's side window, investigators said, Griffis put the car in reverse, peeled out, slammed the brakes and took off while towing a boat. Griffis was later taken into custody at his home.

Court records show that multiple injunctions have been filed against Griffis for repeated allegations of violence. Griffis also has multiple convictions for battery.

As of Friday night, Griffis was in the St. Johns County Jail on a $7,000 bond. He faces four charges of child neglect, one charge of reckless driving and one charge of resisting law enforcement.

704,Restaurant review: Uncle Nick's in South Lakeland offers a taste of New York without the hustle & bustle,"LAKELAND — New Yorkers talk fast and always seem to be in a hurry. Maybe not ALL New Yorkers, but a good many.

And they know good food, especially in the deli department, where a ""baconeggandcheeseonaroll"" is standard commuter fare, a hot, handy meal-on-the-go built for subway portability.

At Uncle Nick's in South Lakeland you can experience the magic without the hustle and bustle. And you can dine on the aforementioned breakfast sandwich any time of day, with your choice of roll or bagel, with a crispy hash brown patty to boot.

Nick DeBellis Jr. opened this deli outpost in October 2015, followed by two more Lakeland locations that have since closed. A Bradenton shop with a similar menu is under new ownership, but the original at 6955 Old Highway 37, just north of Shepherd Road in Lakeland, seems to be cruising along just fine.

DeBellis splits his time between New York and Sarasota. A cousin, Ken DeBellis, is a partner in the Lakeland restaurant that's named for Nick's father, a native of The Bronx, New York, who operated a deli for 25 years.

The Lakeland menu is heavy on sandwiches, but the owners have recently beefed things up with more Italian-American fare, things like hot meatball subs and chicken parmigiana.

You can pluck a number of items from a refrigerator case to take home, or shop for Italian cookies, pastas, sauces, olives and other treats. Like any delicatessen, meats and cheeses are available by the slice, or pound. Boar's Head products are in good supply.

I'm not sure why they call it The Bishop, but it's No. 10 on the sandwich lineup and it's a keeper — a sub roll piled with eggplant shaved cardboard-thin, breaded and fried, fresh mozzarella, roasted red pepper and chopped romaine dressed in a killer Italian vinaigrette. Ecclesiastically speaking, it should be elevated to The Pope.

Uncle Nick does meatballs equally well, bathing them in a classic, slightly sweet marinara and topping them with melted mozz. Just sprinkle the grated Parmesan and pair with a plate of perfect fries.

The restaurant's bagels are better than average to this Florida boy, but a companion who recently moved here from Long Island wasn't quite so quick with praise. In her estimation the bagels could use a little more substance, (meaning everything's better in New York).

Still, my Long Island lunch mate heartily endorsed the overall vibe, and attention to detail with Nick's generously proportioned grinders, subs and clubs. There's also a selection of omelets and breakfast sandwiches sporting names like the Jersey Giant (two eggs, ham, grilled onions, Swiss cheese and grilled tomato on a toasted bun).

If bagels and lox are your thing, Nick's has you covered. Go all the way by adding cream cheese, tomato, red onion and capers. It's a mashup created in New York, after all.

Burgers, salads and chicken noodle soup round out a menu that aims to emulate the quintessential New York corner deli that speaks Italian and delivers textbook cannoli, the crisp shell tasting of cinnamon, the creamy ricotta filling not too sweet.

One very smart move was to put Brooklyn's very own Junior's cheesecake on the menu, which to my mind is what every cheesecake aspires to be — three fingers high, sinfully rich, not too dense and not too light, tasting of vanilla and a hint of lemon with a thin crust of something approximating sponge cake.

Three Uncle Nick's in one town of Lakeland's size proved overly ambitious. But one is just right.

707,"After Beyoncé surprise album, Netflix 'Homecoming' documentary features familiar FAMU faces","Before the much-anticipated Netflix documentary, “Homecoming: A Film By Beyoncé” was scheduled to start streaming at 3:01 a.m. Wednesday, Don P. Roberts wasn’t quite sure what to expect.

The Queen Bey dropped a surprise 40-track album Wednesday to accompany the documentary, wowing the world and her faithful Beehive of fans.

But the former Marching 100 drum major — chosen by the star’s team to help bring the authentic HBCU culture to her 2018 Coachella concert upon which the film is based — expected it to include glimpses of faces familiar to Florida A&M University alumni.

In a nod to the pop culture icon’s international status – and the total control she commands over her empire — Netflix remained mum on any advance details.

Earlier this month, it did release a trailer, a fast-moving tease of some of the scenes.

Included was snapshot of men wearing FAMU T-shirts, which already has made its way around social media.

USA Today reported it gives “glimpses at Queen Bey and her team's preparation for the performance, set to the words of Maya Angelou.”

""I want to be representative of my race: the human race,"" the late poet and activist can be heard saying. ""I have a chance to show how kind we can be, how intelligent and generous we can be. I have a chance to teach and to love and to laugh. I know that when I finish doing what I'm sent here to do, I will be called home, and I will go home without any fear (or) trepidations wondering what's going to happen.""

Special premier viewings were held Tuesday night at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and Texas Southern University in the star’s hometown of Houston.

Myrcele Neal-Scott, president of the Marching 100, saw the documentary with a group of other band members who are in Torrance, Calif., to perform at the closing ceremony of the Honda Campus All-Star Challenge championship Tuesday night.

Seeing Marching 100 alum who they looked up to performing with Beyonce’ was powerful, Neal-Scott said.

“It was inspiring and humbling,” said the graduating senior from Pompano Beach.

Netflix's 'Homecoming' documentary has FAMU ties

The two-hour-plus film captures a behind-the-scenes look at Beyoncé’s groundbreaking 2018 performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.

In it, she exposed the world to homecoming culture at HBCUs, complete with dancers, a nod to Greek life, marching bands and drumlines.

Beyoncé’s affinity for HBCUs stems from her father, who graduated from Fisk University, a private HBCU in Nashville, Tennessee.

The Florida A&M influence was propelled when Beyoncé’s team requested the assistance of Roberts, a FAMU alum and former Marching 100 drum major, who is recognized as one of the country’s most respected music educators.

Roberts attended FAMU from 1980 to 1985, earning his degree in music education. One of his classmates was Shelby Chipman, current professor of music and director of marching and pep bands at the university.

Based in Atlanta, Roberts is CEO of DRUMLine Live, music supervisor for DeKalb County Schools and former band director at Southwest DeKalb High School.

Roberts gained national recognition as executive band consultant for the movie “Drumline,” where he was in charge of working with actors, creating the precision drills and more.

He also served as band consultant for the BET series “The Quad” which which was set on a fictitious black university campus in Atlanta.

DRUMLine Live is an international tour production, including alumni from Florida A&M, Tennessee State, Alabama State and other HBCUs.

Among its members are former FAMU musicians and dancers with campus troupes. Former Marching 100 drum major Slater Thorpe, serves as its show announcer, the same role he snagged for Beyoncé’s Coachella performance.

2018 Coachella performance: First black woman to headline, other achievements

It was Roberts who was sought after by Beyoncé’s team to help bring the HBCU experience to her Coachella production.

“None of us had a role in the 'Homecoming' Netflix special,” Roberts said. “However, I'm sure you will see most of them in the special.”

Roberts said DRUMLine Live was responsible for securing HBCU-experienced band members to blend in with the group already established by Beyoncé’s team for her performance at Coachella.

“Her musicians were incredible and so were the members of DRUMLine Live,” Roberts said. “They made an extraordinary team that made musical history together. We were not responsible for the steppers and dancers. I selected all members from DRUMLine Live and assisted her musical director with rehearsals. I think our greatest role was bringing true HBCU authenticity to Coachella.”

That was critical, Robert said.

“Going into the project, my biggest concern was being authentic to the HBCU culture,” he said. “I know the Beehive was tough, but I knew if we did not properly pay tribute to the HBCU culture, inclusive of marching band, sororities, and fraternities, we were gonna have to deal with the wrath and scorn of HBCU band heads and alumni worldwide.”

Fortune magazine reported Beyoncé — the first black woman to headline at Coachella — broke viewership records on YouTube, with her HBCU-themed set attracting 458,000 simultaneous global viewers at its peak, making it the most viewed Coachella performance ever.

Her performance included over 100 singers, dancers, and musicians.

“I applaud the Queen and her staff for taking such a huge risk, but also for flawlessly executing what some may have thought was an impossible task,” Roberts said. “She is now a part of HBCU music history forever. I think her impact will be felt in the future by the positive exposure it will bring to the HBCU culture.”

708,Mom demands children give their Build-A-Bears to daughter at birthday party,"- This is un-bear-able.

A mom was shocked by an unusual incident that allegedly unfolded at a child’s birthday party and turned to Reddit for advice.

The anonymous poster claimed on Reddit’s Parenting forum that she took her 6-year-old daughter to a classmate’s birthday party at Build-A-Bear Workshop over the weekend.

“The invitation said each kid (about 8 total) would get to make a Bear, and I just assumed they would get to take them home, since that is what happened at another BAB party I went to. Me and my husband even pitched in about 30 dollars as we know these things can get expensive,” the poster wrote on Reddit.

After the children spent time making their special animals and picking accessories, the group left the store and planned to go back to the birthday girl’s house for the rest of the party. However, as the kids left the workshop, the mom of the birthday girl announced each child would have to turn over their animal.

“All is well, we leave the store, then friends mom announces that the kids need to give all their animals to her daughter. Cue the upset and angry kids. They all disappointingly handed over their animals, and friend wasn’t even being nice about it either. Another little boy didn’t want to, and friend ripped it out of his hands. I probably should have said something, but I didn’t. The other parents seemed pretty baffled too,” she wrote.

The mom said she went to the party, but her daughter became upset watching as the birthday girl played with all her new animals.

After she returned home, the mom turned to Reddit asking if “this is totally normal and I should have expected this, or am I being an entitled parent?”

Those on Reddit were quick to respond, defending the mom as not being entitled.

“That is really weird!! I can't believe the parents made all the kids give away their bears,” one person commented.

“Agreed. Beyond strange. I would never in a million years think to have a party where the kids (and our guests) have to give away their item. So bizarre,” another wrote.

“Their daughter and family will forever be remembered for this. And NOT fondly,” another pointed out, concerned the birthday girl will now be disliked by her peers.

Though some tried to reason that maybe the parent throwing the party thought the bears would be gifts — but those attending the party should have been told in the invitation.

“I think it would have been less weird if they had said that up front like ‘Oh she wants a bear specially thought out by each of her friend’ to make it seem like they'll be special or something lol,” one person wrote.

In an update, the original poster explained that she talked to the mom of the party at the school pickup, but did not get a satisfying explanation.

The mom said she asked the mom throwing the party “why the kids didn’t get to keep their bears,” noting she “even pitched in a little bit of money, assuming the bears would go to the kids.

To which the mom allegedly responded, “Well I didn’t have enough money for each of the guests to make their own, that would get pretty expensive! If you want your money back I’ll see about getting it back to you. I don’t really see the problem though.”

Though the mom who wrote the post said she didn’t “push” the topic, she was frustrated that the mom didn’t “have enough money for all the kids” to get a bear, but had “enough [money] for her daughter to get like 8 bears.”

710,"Roadside memorial in Palm Bay draws support, criticism","It was supposed to be a day of new beginnings. Instead, it turned out to be one of heart-rending tragedy for Frank Caufield and his family.

That was the day the 68-year-old learned his 19-year-old grandson Zachary — who was supposed to have a college interview the following day — died after driving off a road and plunging head-on into a grassy, southwest Palm Bay canal.

“He was driving on his way home when the crash happened,” said Frank Caufield, a Satellite Beach resident. “He had just turned 19 in November and the last time I saw him, on Christmas, he was telling me that he wanted to go to Eastern Florida State College to study air conditioning. He was just one of those kids who was really outgoing.”

Now a roadside memorial to the teen, made up of two garden chairs, a tall cross plastered with photos and sun-faded flowers, is stirring controversy.

A couple neighbors want it removed.

Albert Messenger said the memorial is an eyesore that should be removed. He is one of two who contacted Melbourne Tillman Canal authorities about the memorial. A hearing about it is 9 a.m. April 23 at West Melbourne City Hall.

Rules for memorials differ

The memorial, one of any number that dot roadsides across Palm Bay and throughout Brevard County, is the latest to stir emotion as loved ones co-opt the landscape to recall the lives of those killed in traffic crashes.

Among the ubiquitous tributes are memorials to those killed in crashes and accidents over the years: There's one to a 17-year-old Heritage High School student killed while walking along Emerson Drive; another dedicated to boy struck by a car on Minton Road. Further along on Malabar Road, there's one where the shrubbery is ringed with flowers, notes and weathered clothing for a man killed on a motorcycle.

State law does allow for small roadside markers to be placed on state roadways.

Municipalities, however, have varying rules, with some deferring to code enforcement if the tributes are deemed unruly.

""It's considered a private property issue for the most part,"" said Lt. Steve Bland of the Palm Bay Police Department. ""If it's on city property, then it can be something that code enforcement looks at.""

Keeping the memory

The Caufield family is taking up a petition drive to keep the tribute.

They also want more warnings placed along Hoffer Avenue. They believe Zachary Caufield drove into the canal because the warnings about it may not have been clear.

Palm Bay police said the investigation is open and did not release further details surrounding the circumstances leading to the deadly crash.

Melbourne Tillman authorities would not comment on the shrine but sent FLORIDA TODAY a copy of its policy that effectively bans such structures from being placed along any of its 163 miles of canal.

The roadside shrine to Caufield sits along the canal line and sits several yards from Hoffer Avenue and several neighborhood homes.

""It's out at the end of the community I live in. I oppose any of those that are not following the legal guidelines,"" Messenger said. ""I find it distracting. The family is overstepping their bounds. They could have done this at the cemetery.""

For their part, the family said they simply want to remember the teen at the spot where he died and hopefully to remind others to be careful.

They added a picture of his dog, Drac, a boxer who died March 27.

""They're together now,"" Frank Caufield said.

""To us, this is like hallowed ground. Somebody brought out the chairs. The flowers are there also. It's just a place for us to go and pay our respects to him and what we lost.""

711,'Their dads would be so proud',"FORT WALTON BEACH — As little boys playing T-ball, soccer and football — and as top athletes at Choctawhatchee High School — Mason Bruns and Tom Kiehn could always count on their dads cheering from the stands.

Now, the 18-year-old best friends and high school seniors must move on without them.

Hank Bruns, Mason’s 61-year-old dad, suffered a dissective aortic aneurysm and died suddenly on Feb. 7. The 56-year-old Pat Kiehn, Tom’s dad, succumbed to pancreatic cancer on Nov. 19, 2017, about nine months after being diagnosed.

In the fall, Mason and Tom, who met playing football in the seventh grade at Pryor Middle School, will both walk on to their universities' sports teams. They plan to make the announcement at 2 p.m. Thursday in the Choctaw auditorium.

A punter and kicker, Mason will join the football team at Louisiana State University, where his dad competed as a swimmer and a two-time state champion for his Baton Rouge, Louisiana, high school.

Tom also plans to walk on to the soccer team at Rollins College in Winter Park. His dad played football at the University of Nebraska Omaha and, later in life, refereed local football games.

Hank and Pat “believed sports and athletics developed character, mental health and physical health,” said Shari Bruns, Mason’s mom.

The two families have shared a special and tight bond through the years. They would grill peppercorn steaks at cookouts held at each other’s homes. They celebrated Pat’s last birthday together. The Brunses and Kiehns even took a trip to Port St. Joe to go scalloping. On the way back from the Gulf of Mexico, the boat broke down. Later that night, they shared a pizza instead.

Hank and Pat, like their sons, were buddies.

Today, they represent the types of men their sons aspire to be.

On the day Hank died, Mason skipped out the door to track and field practice at Choctaw. He had no idea it would be the last time he would see his dad's smile.

He said love from his family and friends have filled the void from the loss of his father about nine weeks ago.

“God and Dad are the cornerstones of my success,” Mason said. “I would not wish anyone going through what I felt, even my worst enemies. It was heart wrenching. Sleepless nights. Sick to my stomach for a week and a half.

""The first month after his death was a deep blur, a deep state of depression and grief. It’s really hard to explain. I was feeling a freezer in my chest.”

Tom recalled the horror of watching his dad wither away over months. Pat was a strapping man who played football for an elite college program. He spent his whole career as a navigator and as a civilian for the Air Force Special Operations Command, or AFSOC, at Hurlburt Field.

Guilt still wrestles with Tom nearly 18 months later. He remembers thinking a concussion playing soccer that sent the four-year starting goalie — the recipient of Rookie of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year and MVP — to the bench for two weeks early in 2017 was bad. While Tom was recovering, his dad got the news that he had terminal cancer.

“He was a strong and physical guy,” Tom said. “I watched his condition deteriorate. I questioned why did this happen? I was confused and had a whole bunch of different emotions.

“I miss hearing his voice and having conversations with him. When I have accomplishments, I’m not able to tell him, but obviously he knows. I appreciated he believed in me and knew I was able to play at the next level.”

Fortunately, his dad — knowing his condition was terminal — wrote him letters and recorded 10 videos for special occasions throughout Tom’s lifetime. Tom has already read a few of his dad’s letters, which brought tears to his eyes.

Both sons say their dads instilled strong values, a desire to serve others and motivation to succeed. They are described as selfless, humble, hard-working and magnetic men.

Hank ran his own architectural landscaping company. He served as a janitor, bus driver and substitute teacher at Liza Jackson Preparatory School, where he took pleasure in high-fiving and fist-bumping the students. Hank finished his career by serving the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office.

Meanwhile, Pat set an Air Force record by receiving nearly two years in donated sick leave time from his colleagues, said his wife Anna Kiehn. He followed the Golden Rule and would engage McDonald’s employees in banter to make their days better.

When he dropped the boys off to school, he would tell them, “Make today better. Stay strong, confident and courageous!”

Having experienced his dad’s cancer, Tom made sure he was there for Mason.

“Someone had to tell him to save his voicemails,” he said.

Each boy has his favorite memories, too.

Mason said he treasured the bonfires in the backyard with his dad. They would swap stories and talk about life.

Tom enjoyed learning to fly fish from his dad. While battling cancer, Pat took his son to Paradise Valley, Montana, and Tom hooked a 15-pound trout.

When Mason and Tom step on the collegiate field for the first time, their dads may not be in the stands but they will be in their hearts.

Their moms, Shari and Anna, will be there, though.

“It’s sad their dads will not be there. Their dads would be so proud,” Shari said.

Will a time come when Mason and Tom will drift apart after all they have gone through together?

Tom: “I don’t think that’s possible.”

Mason: “Our connection can’t be broken.”",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190416/their-dads-would-be-so-proud?rssfeed=true,2019-04-16T16:16:36Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
712,"Will diners, tourists close their wallets until source of Hep A outbreak is identified?","CLOSE According to the Florida Health Department, hepatitis A is a highly contagious disease that attacks the liver. and the est way to avoid the virus is through diligent cleanliness and a vaccine. GINNY BEAGAN Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

Few customers were around when I stopped out at Palm City Farms last week, and I figured it had something to do with the Heptatis A outbreak.

But it was just the afternoon lull. Owner Rob Dawson said few customers were asking about the outbreak; the farmer's market does little food prep, so the chance for contamination is relatively small.

But still, said Dawson, ""It's scary.""

It is.

More: What we still don't know about Hepatitis A outbreak

As of this writing, the number of Hepatitis A cases in Martin County remains at 19. In the grand scheme of things that’s not huge: Pinellas County has 168 cases, the highest in the state. Pasco County has 152 cases; with a population of just over 525,000, that’s almost 29 cases per 100,000, the highest per-capita rate in the state and more than double the per-capita rate here.

But what makes Martin County’s situation different is the deaths. Hepatitis A is rarely fatal, and since Jan. 1, 2018, only eight people in Florida have died from the malady. Three of them lived here, in Palm City.

Blood sample for hepatitis A virus (HAV) test (Photo: jarun011, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Last week, state epidemiologist Carina Blackmore said there was a “cluster” of cases in Palm City; we knew of five. Then Martin County Commissioner Ed Ciampi said he’d spoken to a Palm City woman who, along with her husband, had Hep A. If they’re among the confirmed cases, that would make 7 of 19 in that one small area.

At the same press conference, Blackmore said five of the 19 are homeless. What of the other seven? Were any of them in Palm City? Health officials have so far declined to say.

Hmm.

The homeless, along with drug users and men who have sex with men — more on that in a moment — are more at-risk than others. But many of the local cases don't seem to fit in these boxes.

Five of the Palm City cases — Jeff and Nancy Kirsch, found dead in their home March 28; Lee Collins, 61, whose family said he died after his liver failed due to Hep A; and Martin Gucciardo, whom I spoke with last week and who said both he and his wife were ill — would not seem to face these known risk factors.

Gucciardo told me he lived right down the street from the Kirsches. They’d never met. But might they have eaten at the same restaurant, ingested some impure product?

“We eat out a lot,” said Gucciardo; he and his wife also have food delivered frequently. He said he was willing to turn over receipts and bank records — anything that could help crack the case. But the Health Department hasn't asked for them.

And here’s where Martin County Sheriff William Snyder’s offer to lend a hand could really help; all the health officials have to do is ask.

As of Tuesday, Snyder said they hadn't.

More: Hepatitis A - what you should and shouldn't do

Meantime, some nervous diners say they’re staying home. Carol Goodcuff of Stuart emailed me last week to say that, “my family will not be frequenting any restaurants in the area until we know the sources of these outbreaks. And we’re not alone.”

One also wonders if news of the outbreak, now being reported nationwide, could become yet another reason for tourists to avoid Martin County (as if our periodic blue-green algae outbreaks weren't enough).

Buy Photo Gil Smart (Photo: JEREMIAH WILSON/TCPALM)

This is how the Hepatitis A outbreak could take a toll on our local economy.

And it’s another reason the Health Department must move quickly. So long as people don't know the source, more and more will decide it's not worth risking their health eating here, coming here.

Health officials really ought to take Snyder up on his offer.

Meantime, vigilance is all we've got.

People need to get the vaccine. I got mine Saturday, at the Walmart in Stuart. I got there early to avoid what I was sure would be a mob scene, but there were only about a dozen others. Then, over the weekend, I heard two different people say: “Do you really think I should get the shot?”

My God. Yes, absolutely.

Lastly, a word about those “at-risk” populations. According to the Florida Department of Health, 59 percent of those who got the virus since Jan. 1, 2018, reported at least one of the following risk factors: any drug use (54 percent); non-injection drug use (35 percent); injection drug use (34 percent); recent homelessness (17 percent); men who have sex with men (7 percent).

On that last one, I got a call from Stuart City Commissioner Mike Meier, who noticed it wasn't mentioned at state Sen. Gayle Harrell’s Hep A press conference last week. It was probably just an oversight, he said — although conservative Martin County can be a little, well, conservative about such things.

But there is indeed such a population here, and it’s vital for health officials to reach out to them “so they can protect themselves, their friends, families and loved ones,” said Meier.

“Ultimately, this affects the whole community,” Meier said.

And it does. But boy, wouldn’t it be nice if this outbreak would stop affecting Martin County so acutely?

713,Local therapy dog Spencer returns to Boston Marathon sporting yellow raincoat,"Spencer the therapy dog gets ready for this years Boston Marathon (Photo by Rich Powers) Spencer the therapy dog gets ready for this years Boston Marathon (Photo by Rich Powers)

- If you had your eyes on this year’s Boston Marathon, it was difficult to miss the local celebrity who stole the hearts of millions by being a very good boy.

Local therapy dog Spencer was seen cheering on the racers from the sidelines wearing a yellow raincoat at the Boston Marathon trail this year with his owner, Rich Powers, giving the runners something to look forward to.

Powers posted a video of the pup to his Facebook page, saying, “Another year motivating some awesome athletes and it looks like we can lose the raincoat soon!”







In 2018, a video of Spencer in his owner’s raincoat holding two flags in his mouth with the words “Boston Strong” written on them went viral, garnering millions of views.

“We were there to motivate and judging by the faces we saw running, it was a success,” Powers told Inside Edition in an interview last year.







Spencer has been a regular at the marathon for the past three years. He and his sister Penny were both supposed to attend the race, but because of weather conditions, Spencer attended the race without his sister.

Spencer and Penny are both therapy dogs and spend their time visiting local schools and hospitals, according to Powers’ Facebook.

715,Teen arrested in connection with shooting death in Flagler County,"FLAGLER COUNTY, Fla. - The Flagler County Sheriff’s Office on Sunday arrested 17-year-old Marion Lee Gavins and charged him with first-degree murder in the shooting death of 18-year-old Curtis Israel Gray.

On Saturday, Gray died after what deputies said was an altercation outside the Coin Laundry on Belle Terre near Palm Coast Parkway.

To get the news that your child has not just died, but has been violently taken from you. There are no words,"" said Gray's mother, Carmen Gray.

Gray is hurting, and she wishes her 18-year-son was still here. She said he had so much promise.

""(He was a) very bright young man and very talented,"" said Gray.

Curtis Gray was only a month away from his high school graduation, and he was bound for college.

Flagler Palm Coast High School track and field coach Dave Halliday, who coached Gray, said he was a likeable teammate and ambitious athlete.

Curtis Gray was the victim of a shooting death on Saturday. Photo contributed.

""He cared more about helping others over himself,"" Halliday said. ""He'll certainly be missed. The kids are shocked and taking it pretty hard. I was just stunned. You never want to see anything like this happen to anyone, let alone a young man who (was) weeks away from graduating high school.""

Deputies said Gavins turned himself in at 3 p.m. Sunday with his mom present.

""I have no doubt that we have the right person,"" said Flagler County Sheriff Ricky Staly. ""This is a tragedy for two families: one who has lost a son who was an inspiring athlete and another whose son will likely spend the rest of his life in prison and possibly even face the death penalty.""

Gavins was previously arrested in October 2014 for sale of marijuana within 1,000 feet of a school, violation of probation and possession of a weapon on school campus in 2015 and domestic violence 2016, according to deputies.

As for the victim, Gray’s mom and family are trying so hard to move forward, knowing it’s tough. But, they’re being positive.

""To know, as a mom, that I birth a young man that has such a reach is amazing to me. And I’ll tell you what, I was proud of him when he was alive, and I’m proud of him even in his death, I want to celebrate that,"" said Cheryl Gray.

Right now, Gavins is sitting behind bars in juvenile custody. Staly says he’s pushing for Gavins to be charged as an adult.

716,The Venice Shark's Tooth Festival is something 'Special',"The 27th Annual Shark's Tooth Festival is a fundraiser for the Special Olympics of Sarasota County.

VENICE — Lewis Stieffel was a boy on the beaches of Venice when he started looking for shark's teeth.

And it wasn't hard.

Stick your hand in the shell line at any beach from Manasota Key to Englewood and you'll get a hand (or sifter) full of the glistening black teeth of a tiger, hammerhead, mako or even a prehistoric megalodon, the largest shark ever.

""It's always a thrill no matter what you find — it's a discovery,"" said Stieffel at the 27th Annual Shark's Tooth Festival in Venice. ""Out of nine billion people on the planet you're the very first person to see it, to ever touch that fossil. It's always a thrill, even if it’s a common fossil.""

The three-day event hosted by the Special Olympics of Sarasota County was a fundraiser for local Special Olympians.

""We don't charge fees for Special Olympians to participate in our programs,"" said Randy Klinger, director of the Special Olympics of Sarasota County. ""Festivals like these are fundraisers we use to help us provide equipment, training, practices — they help basically provide the programming so we can get athletes to the state games and have them participate in Special Olympics at no cost.""

Klinger said Special Olympics was pleased to partner with an event with such a long and proud history.

""This is the first year Special Olympics as an organization has conducted this shark's tooth festival. Obviously when you have shark's teeth, fossils, 165 vendors, food, bands, it's a great event.""

In past years, the proceeds were split between the Special Olympics and individuals with special needs.

The main attraction this weekend was the giant, charcoal-colored megalodon teeth on display in three fossil tents. They were estimated to be anywhere from 2 to 3.6 million years old.

Megalodon could grow to be about 60 feet long and had 45 front teeth — 24 in the upper jaw and 22 in the lower jaw. The largest teeth ever found were about 7½ inches long, the distance from the serrated tip of the extinct shark's cutting tooth to the top of the root.

Stieffel said the large teeth, which can weigh just a few ounces to about a pound, are interesting, but he's not one of those ""triangle guys."" He likes putting together fossilized bones.

Fossils can be found just about anywhere in Florida — and are not necessarily limited to Gulf waters.

""Any wheres they're digging a hole in this part of Florida you stop and look,"" Stieffel said. ""I found a mammoth skull, I found some walrus tusks in the Peace River they needed for a study. I've found a lot of different fossils.""

Megalodon teeth can fetch anywhere from about $20 for a small, partial tooth to over $5,000 for a pristine 7-inch tooth.

Doug Mann of Fossilicious.com, an online vendor selling teaching materials and fossils, says it depends on the quality. He published a megalodon buyer's guide on his website, fossils-facts-and-finds.com, to help rookie fossil hunters.

""A lot of them have the enamels chipped off,"" Mann said. ""Some are pretty complete and some have serrations on the end.""

The plethora of shark's teeth in Florida are because of the rise and fall of the glaciers, which last submerged most of the peninsula under 100 feet of water about 2.5 million years ago. Only about a 50-mile wide area of the central state extended south from the Florida Panhandle.

That allowed sharks to freely swim over most of South Florida.

Stieffel said he attended one of the first Shark's Tooth Festivals in Venice as a boy, when it was held at a nearby beach.

""It's a transition that still surprises me how fast it's grown,"" he said. ""Until the day I die, I’ll be interested in this. You just can't not be fascinated with it.""

Festival-goers Mike Berry and his family, of Venice, all clad in shark-related regalia, said the area's prehistoric past is what drew them to the area.

""Go down to Englewood Beach,"" Berry said. ""Put your hand in the shell line and you're going to find five or six teeth.""

They recommended Blind Pass Beach, known as Middle Beach, for shark tooth hunting, where Berry's son, John, found a partial megalodon fossil.

""I thought it was a rock to be honest,"" John Berry said.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190414/venice-sharks-tooth-festival-is-something-special?rssfeed=true,2019-04-14T17:34:03Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236
719,Man accused of throwing a child at the Mall of America has criminal record,"BLOOMINGTON, Minn. - The man arrested for allegedly pushing or throwing a boy from the third floor of the Mall of America in Minnesota had been banned from the mall in the past and once told police he had anger issues, court records show.

Witnesses said Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, 24, either pushed or threw the 5-year-old boy on Friday morning from the third level of the Bloomington mall's interior to the first-level floor nearly 40 feet below, police said.

Aranda, whom police said took off running after the incident, was found inside the mall's transit station and arrested.

Authorities described the boy's injuries as life-threatening and said witnesses gave him first aid. Police Chief Jeff Potts said he couldn't reveal details about the child's condition Saturday afternoon.

""The child is still alive, he's still receiving care, and I think we're just asking for thoughts and prayers for that child to recover,"" Potts told reporters outside his police department Saturday.

At this point, police do not believe there is a relationship between the family of the child and the suspect, Potts said.

Investigators are trying to figure out the motive, he said.

""(Through) our investigative work and witnesses that we've spoken to, we feel confident saying that the suspect threw the child off of the third floor. But as to why he did that, is still something we're looking into and trying to figure out.""

Aranda is being held on suspicion of attempted homicide, and police expect to submit the case to prosecutors in support of charges by noon Monday, Potts said.

Suspect has a history with the mall

Aranda lives in the Bloomington area and has had a series of arrests and convictions related to the mall.

He had been banned from Mall of America in the past and was convicted of misdemeanors in two incidents there in 2015, court records show.

Aranda was charged in July 2015 with causing damage inside stores after he threw items off the upper level of the mall to the lower level, court records obtained by CNN affiliate WCCO show.

He was accused three months later of throwing glasses of ice water and tea at a woman in a restaurant at the mall after she refused to buy him food, the records show. In that incident, he got into a physical scuffle with the manager of the restaurant, sending panicked diners fleeing, according to court records that also note Aranda at that point had been banned from Mall of America property through early July 2016.

In August 2015, witnesses saw Aranda smashing computers on the floor of a Minneapolis library, causing about $5,000 in damage, according to a 2015 complaint. Police were called and arrested him without incident after finding him at a bus stop across the street.

Aranda in that case told authorities he got ""angry after he read something on the Facebook"" and so smashed five computers, screens and keyboards, court records show, citing a recorded statement. ""He said he has some anger issues and told the officer that it does not happen all the time,"" the complaint states.

Child's mother was screaming

A witness Friday at the mall told WCCO that the child's mother was screaming that someone had thrown her child from the balcony.

""She was screaming, 'Everyone pray, everyone pray. Oh, my God, my baby, someone threw him over the edge,'"" Brian Johnson told WCCO.

Mall of America officials said any more information about the incident will come from police.

720,"Motorcyclist killed in Hollywood was wearing unsafe helmet, police say","HOLLYWOOD, Fla. - A month after Jorge Melendez died in a motorcycle crash, Hollywood Police Department detectives were still investigating the incident Friday.

Melendez was riding a white Suzuki GSX-R1000 sport bike when he crashed at the intersection of 64th Avenue and Park Street, police said. Officers said the quality of his helmet was not in compliance with the Department of Transportation's safety standards.

Officer Christian Lata, a spokesman for the department, released the crash report saying it was redacted because there was a minor involved. A teenage boy was driving a maroon 2016 Ford Explorer when he struck Melendez about 9:45 p.m. March 13.

Officers reported the impact caused motorcycle's front wheel to be crushed inward and the tire to be taken off the rim. The front faring of the motorcycle was pushed inward and the gas tank upward, police said.

Hollywood Fire Rescue personnel took Melendez to Memorial Regional Hospital where doctors pronounced him dead about 10:40 p.m., March 13. Officers determined the teenage boy failed to yield to Melendez who was traveling southbound on 64th Avenue.

The teenager told police officers he didn't see Melendez approaching when he turned west onto Park Street because the motorcycle's headlight was not on, according to the crash report. The front seat passenger of the Ford Explorer told officers he was looking down at his phone.

Miranda Grossman, a spokesperson for the Hollywood Police Department, said Friday the investigation is still active.

721,Mary Baer's 1993 interview with Michael Haim: 'Something just wasn't right',"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - It was January 1993 when I sat down with Michael Haim in the living room of his Northside home while an active search was underway for his wife, Bonnie. Never could I have imagined that her body could be right outside, buried by the pool.

I was reporting on the night shift for the 11 p.m. Eyewitness News broadcast. When I found out we could talk to a missing mother's husband on camera, I remember thinking it would make for a good story.

Stepping into their home, I recall looking around at photographs of their little boy, Aaron, other pictures of the family and precious photos of a loving, 23-year-old mother with her son.

Did he kill her? I remember wrestling with the thought in my mind. Had he ever been violent with her? How can I ask?

Michael Haim seemed quiet and somehow not urgent in his message asking for the community's help finding Bonnie. He averted his eyes while telling me about her, saying she got upset and left the house and never returned. He claimed he didn't know where she was.

I remember being surprised when he called Aaron out to join us, placing the 3½-year-old boy on his lap, so he'd be on camera, and asking his tow-headed son, ""Where's Mommy? Where's Mommy?""

Little Aaron gazing up at his daddy, and answered, ""She's not here.""

FROM WJXT ARCHIVES: Mary Baer's report on search for Bonnie Haim

Something just wasn't right. I left feeling certain that the young woman could not have left her beautiful boy. As a young mother myself, it just didn't seem possible.

We now know that boy would never see his biological mother again. He was adopted and raised by another family, won that Northside home in a wrongful death lawsuit against Michael Haim, and as an adult, would dig up Bonnie Haim's remains in the backyard while trying to rehab the house for sale.

Giving a victim-impact statement Friday afternoon minutes after Michael Haim was found guilty of second-degree murder, Aaron Frazer showed emotion that he had not when testifying during the trial.

""I think anyone can imagine, even if it's not a loved one, finding a skull, picking it up, just what that would do to somebody. Not to mention, it's your mother,"" Fraser said.

Asked if that was the only physical interaction he remembered with his biological mother, the almost 30-year-old answered, ""Yes.""

723,Florida History: What Oscar-winning celebrity committed suicide in a Florida beach house?,"He was wearing a swim suit and a bath robe. His body was hanging in a closet of a rented beach cottage, a red and white belt cinched around his neck.

When he didn't show up for breakfast at a nearby restaurant, a neighbor went to the house and found him.

John Monk Saunders -- Army aviator, author, Rhodes Scholar, magazine editor, Academy Award-winning writer, and recently divorced husband of actress Fay Wray, of ""King Kong"" fame -- was dead at age 42.

""BEACH WRITER HANGS SELF,"" screamed the banner Page 1 headline in The Fort Myers News-Press on March 12, 1940. It was front-page news across the country, too.

More classic Hollywood: How Veronica Lake's career began and ended in Florida

The small, two-bedroom cottage that Saunders rented in Fort Myers Beach on Florida's southwest coast was about as far as you could get from Hollywood, where his stories of wartime fliers were turned into classic movies such as ""Wings,"" which won the first Oscar for best motion picture.

Saunders had been in a tailspin for a long time. Handsome and talented, he was once dubbed the ""Golden Boy."" But alcohol, drugs and mood swings began to dominate his personality.

And then there was the way he treated his wife.

King Kong desired Wray's character so much that he fought off airplanes on top of the Empire State Building. But in real life, Saunders cheated constantly on his wife, neglecting her and saying she bored him. Toward the end of their marriage, he even kidnapped their two-year-old daughter, and spent all her money.

He didn't leave a suicide note. His life was one long suicide note.

Except to early film fans, Saunders is mostly forgotten, but the sad arc of his life is getting attention again in an excellent new memoir by Wray's daughter. And few know that if it wasn't for Saunders, the man many consider Hollywood's most debonair actor might have a different name.

***

Fay Wray never forgot the first time she saw Saunders at the gates of Paramount's studio.

""It was a warm summer afternoon. He was dressed in white flannels, a dark-blue blazer and wore a white Panama hat. I thought he was astonishingly good-looking.""

Wray's recollection is quoted in her daughter Victoria Riskin's new book, ""Fay Wray and Robert Riskin: A Hollywood Memoir"" (Pantheon). In telling the story of Wray's happier marriage to her father, screenwriter Riskin (""It Happened One Night""), she recounts her childhood surprise at discovering her mother had been wed before.

Saunders and Wray met in 1927. She was 18, a rising star who had never gone on a date. He was ten years older. Wray felt ""a current of sensory feeling"" when Saunders touched her arm. They fell hard for each other, but he was having an affair with the wife of studio chief Jesse Lasky, and he told her he wasn't planning to stop.

She married him, anyway.

In her youthful ""confusion,"" Riskin wrote, she tried to accept a man who drank heavily and blamed his infidelities on being ""oversexed.""

On the surface, they were glamour personified. She became an icon for playing the Beauty to King Kong's Beast. His aviation and underworld tales were turned into movies for legendary directors William Wellman, Josef von Sternberg and Howard Hawks.

Saunders' pinnacle was winning the Oscar for Best Story for Hawks' ""The Dawn Patrol."" But as his drinking magnified, the work dried up, Riskin wrote.

The couple had brief glimpses of happiness, but then Wray would catch him drunk or with other women. Saunders would make anti-Semitic, pro-Hitler comments. At a party, he decked actor Herbert Marshall, who had lost a leg in World War I, which played badly in the gossip columns.

Wray became pregnant and they had a daughter, Susan, but it didn't help their relationship.

""John's decline accelerated,"" Riskin wrote. ""His pupils were often enlarged, his eyes vacant, his movements bizarrely slowed.""

When she woke up to find him injecting a drug into her, Wray finally asked for a divorce. He retaliated by selling their house and taking all her money.

As she worked to replenish her bank accounts, he kidnapped their daughter for a couple of months and eventually landed in Charlottesville, Va., where he checked into a hospital for ""a nervous condition"" and had their daughter put in the pediatric unit.

Custody laws favored fathers in Virginia at the time, Riskin wrote, but Wray managed to take Susan back to California and get a divorce. Saunders went for more treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, but finally headed south with a nurse, winding up in Fort Myers.

""For a long time, John had been standing precariously at the abyss,"" Riskin wrote. ""Now he had reached the dark and lonely end of his journey.""

***

Saunders was no stranger to Florida. He did his military training here. And it was front page news when he arrived in Fort Myers in February 1940.

""This is Mr. Saunders' second season at the beach,"" the News-Press reported, ""which he says is the best place he has found for a rest, as well as the quietude he needs for his working hours.""

He apparently kept to himself, preferring long walks and time alone in his cottage. It was the 1940s version of celebrity rehab. But his nurse departed three days before he was found dead on March 11, and he probably shouldn't have been left alone.

After his suicide, rumors about a dissolute lifestyle quickly spread, and the paper followed up with another front page story on March 13: ""Beach Friends Deny 'Wild Tales' About John M. Saunders.""

Local restaurant owners got to know him, including Mrs. Watt Harris, who ran the tea room where he was supposed to show up for breakfast.

""Mr. Saunders was a lovable character,"" Mrs. Harris (no first name given in those days) told the News-Press. ""He was sensitive and nervous and not in good health and insisted on working long hours. Sometimes he drank too much and then hated himself for doing so.""

Harris said Wray called her soon after his death. According to national news accounts at the time, the actress was ""heartbroken,"" and had ""collapsed.""

""He often told me how proud he was of the fine life and happy times he had lived with Miss Wray,"" Harris told the Fort Myers paper. ""I don't know why he wanted to take his life except he was not happy and his work did not make his life complete.

""The only reason I'm saying all this about Mr. Saunders is that some people had spread wild tales,"" she added. ""He may have had too much to drink for his own good but he was always a gentleman.""

Why did he kill himself? Some trace Saunders' problems to the fact that he spent World War I in Florida -- as a flight instructor instead of in heroic combat. A columnist friend claimed that punching actor Marshall had exiled him from Hollywood, and he couldn't bear it. Today, his mood swings and drinking might be diagnosed as a bipolar disorder.

***

Saunders' abbreviated career remains, at best, a footnote in Hollywood history. In the 1920s and early 1930s, though, his name was big enough that it was a selling point in advertisements for his films.

Perhaps his true claim to fame is a gift he unknowingly gave to a young actor.

In 1931, Saunders wrote his only novel, ""Single Lady,"" a Lost Generation tale of a French girl and her soldier pals that critics felt was patterned too closely on Hemingway's writing. It was turned into a Broadway musical called ""Nikki."" Despite Wray as the star, it did about as well as the book, closing after 39 performances.

Her leading man in the show was a former acrobat and vaudeville comic with the curious moniker of Archibald Leach. Saunders had named Leach's character Cary Lockwood.

When Leach went to Hollywood, he needed to change his name to something suitable for a movie star. Fond of Wray and his experience acting with her, he chose the name Cary, then added the last name of Grant. You know the rest.

Until she died at age 96 in 2004, Wray never spoke unkindly about Saunders. When writing her autobiography, she fretted to a New York Times reporter that it was ""unfair"" to expose his weaknesses.

""How can anyone make a judgment on what other people do?'' Wray said in that 1989 interview. ''It's just not possible for me. It's so tragic that John had this theme in his life of living dangerously and dying young.''

In an interview last month with the Los Angeles Times about her memoir, Victoria Riskin said Wray ""didn’t talk a lot about (Saunders) except toward the end of her life. I found in some of her personal notes that she felt she had let him down. She knew she was stronger. She knew she was caring and didn’t find that key to open the door to saving him.

""She felt that she should have been able to help him, and she couldn’t. He was beyond help.""

725,Restaurant review: A taste of New York without the hustle & bustle,"LAKELAND — New Yorkers talk fast and always seem to be in a hurry. Maybe not ALL New Yorkers, but a good many.

And they know good food, especially in the deli department, where a ""baconeggandcheeseonaroll"" is standard commuter fare, a hot, handy meal-on-the-go built for subway portability.

At Uncle Nick's in South Lakeland you can experience the magic without the hustle and bustle. And you can dine on the aforementioned breakfast sandwich any time of day, with your choice of roll or bagel, with a crispy hash brown patty to boot.

Nick DeBellis Jr. opened this deli outpost in October 2015, followed by two more Lakeland locations that have since closed. A Bradenton shop with a similar menu is under new ownership, but the original at 6955 Old Highway 37, just north of Shepherd Road in Lakeland, seems to be cruising along just fine.

DeBellis splits his time between New York and Sarasota. A cousin, Ken DeBellis, is a partner in the Lakeland restaurant that's named for Nick's father, a native of The Bronx, New York, who operated a deli for 25 years.

The Lakeland menu is heavy on sandwiches, but the owners have recently beefed things up with more Italian-American fare, things like hot meatball subs and chicken parmigiana.

You can pluck a number of items from a refrigerator case to take home, or shop for Italian cookies, pastas, sauces, olives and other treats. Like any delicatessen, meats and cheeses are available by the slice, or pound. Boar's Head products are in good supply.

I'm not sure why they call it The Bishop, but it's No. 10 on the sandwich lineup and it's a keeper — a sub roll piled with eggplant shaved cardboard-thin, breaded and fried, fresh mozzarella, roasted red pepper and chopped romaine dressed in a killer Italian vinaigrette. Ecclesiastically speaking, it should be elevated to The Pope.

Uncle Nick does meatballs equally well, bathing them in a classic, slightly sweet marinara and topping them with melted mozz. Just sprinkle the grated Parmesan and pair with a plate of perfect fries.

The restaurant's bagels are better than average to this Florida boy, but a companion who recently moved here from Long Island wasn't quite so quick with praise. In her estimation the bagels could use a little more substance, (meaning everything's better in New York).

Still, my Long Island lunch mate heartily endorsed the overall vibe, and attention to detail with Nick's generously proportioned grinders, subs and clubs. There's also a selection of omelets and breakfast sandwiches sporting names like the Jersey Giant (two eggs, ham, grilled onions, Swiss cheese and grilled tomato on a toasted bun).

If bagels and lox are your thing, Nick's has you covered. Go all the way by adding cream cheese, tomato, red onion and capers. It's a mashup created in New York, after all.

Burgers, salads and chicken noodle soup round out a menu that aims to emulate the quintessential New York corner deli that speaks Italian and delivers textbook cannoli, the crisp shell tasting of cinnamon, the creamy ricotta filling not too sweet.

One very smart move was to put Brooklyn's very own Junior's cheesecake on the menu, which to my mind is what every cheesecake aspires to be — three fingers high, sinfully rich, not too dense and not too light, tasting of vanilla and a hint of lemon with a thin crust of something approximating sponge cake.

Three Uncle Nick's in one town of Lakeland's size proved overly ambitious. But one is just right.

Broadway Palm’s customers have been saying it for years: Give us something new, something fresh, something different.

Well, now they’re getting exactly that: A season packed with relatively recent hit musicals, including “Kinky Boots,” “Finding Neverland,” “Something Rotten” and “Once.”

“We’re definitely picking newer, contemporary, recent Broadway shows,” says Broadway Palm owner Will Prather. “We wanted to have an emphasis on new. … We’ve really been trying to listen to our audience.”

It’s a bold, risky move for the Fort Myers dinner theater, Prather admits. He could potentially alienate older audiences who’d rather see warhorses like the beloved 1959 musical “The Sound of Music” — the only show older than 20 years in Broadway Palm’s recently announced 2019-20 season.

Then again, younger people are the future of Broadway Palm. And Prather thinks his audiences are ready for the change.

“I think they’re going to trust us and be excited and enthused about it,” he says.

Broadway Palm’s new season is part of an adventurous 2019 for Prather. Chapter two of that adventure: His Fort Myers-based Prather Touring Company — part of the bigger Prather Productions, the Fort Myers-based company that includes Broadway Palm and The Dutch Apple Dinner Theatre in Lancaster, Pennsylvania — is heading overseas for the first time in its 11-year history.

The company’s “The Wizard of Oz” began touring the United States in 2017, including a stop last year at Mann Hall. Now it’s going on a four-month tour of China starting this August. That will be followed by a tour of the Middle East.

The Chinese tour starts at Foshan Grand Theater in Foshan, and then travels to Tianqiao Performing Arts Center in Beijing, Shanghai Daning Theater in Shanghai and several other Chinese cities. Then it goes to the Middle East for stops in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and more.

“Taking our first show internationally to China is something I never imagined we would be doing,” he says. “The touring company has definitely grown over the past few years and has become the largest division of Prather Productions.

“It has opened up opportunities for us to produce new shows that would not normally be available to our dinner theatres.”

Prather Touring (also known as APEX Touring) often goes hand-in-hand with Broadway Palm and the Prather family's Dutch Apple Dinner Theatre. “Finding Neverland,” for example, plays Broadway Palm for six weeks and then goes on a 14-week national tour.

Then there’s another big experiment for Broadway Palm with “Once.” The intimate folk-rock romance plays six weeks at Broadway Palm, and then jumps to nearby Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall to do its technical work and prepare for a 20-week national tour. That includes a two-day run at Mann Hall.

Prather’s a big fan of the heartfelt musical, and his family knows the show’s producers and performers. He’s seen it four times already.

“It’s a show I’ve had my eye on for years,” he says. “It’s just a beautiful production.”

The show will be directed by J. Michael Zygo, a cast member from the original 2012 Broadway production. The tour also features sets and musical instruments from the original production, Prather says, including the famous working bar onstage.

Scott Saxon, general manager of Mann Hall, says he’s thrilled about working with Prather again. “It’s just a natural fit, I think.”

It also means audiences at Mann Hall and elsewhere in the United States will get a terrific show they might not otherwise see in 2019-20.

“I love the show,” Saxon says. “It’s a nice counterpoint to the usual spectacle (of Broadway). ... It shows the wide range of things that Broadway has to offer.

""It’s a small, intimate show, and it’s just so engaging.

729,Sarasota's Rosemary Birthing Home to close,"Midwife involved in recent delivery that severely injured baby was prepared to take over

A Sarasota birthing center profiled as part of a nine-month investigation by GateHouse Media and the Herald-Tribune will soon close its doors.

Rosemary Birthing Home made the announcement on its website this week. The decision follows a series of adverse outcomes culminating with an incident in January that severely injured a baby boy after a midwife attempted to deliver him breech.

The owner of Rosemary was previously trying to sell the business to the midwife involved in that January incident, according to a source. But citing financial concerns, the center will close instead.

Miller also filed notice of the closure with the state.

“Hearing the news that Rosemary Birthing Home is closing is a huge victory,” said Riva Majewski, who lost her daughter during an attempted home birth with a Rosemary midwife in 2016. “This brings my husband and I a great sense of relief and finally after three years, a feeling of justice for our precious Baby V.”

Harmony Miller, the owner of Rosemary, did not return calls, emails or texts seeking comment Tuesday.

On its website, the birthing center said it would continue serving clients who deliver before May 12, but referred all others to the Birth Center of St. Pete and Birthways Family Birth Center in Sarasota. Both centers have waived their registration fees for families who already paid them to Rosemary.

Birthways has already begun receiving clients as a result of the announcement, said its owner, Christina Holmes, also a state-licensed midwife.

“We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience, and for the abruptness of this announcement,” Rosemary employees wrote in the online statement. “Despite our best efforts to create a closure that would enable us to provide care until each of you had your precious baby, and your postpartum care was completed, it is not financially possible to maintain the business until everyone in care delivers without taking in new clients.”

Rosemary drew ire from some area obstetricians, who say they were overwhelmed with the number of emergency hospital transfers originating at the birthing home.

From 2007 through the end of 2017, midwives at Rosemary delivered 396 babies inside the birth center and called for hospital transfers 130 times, according to a review of annual reports filed with the Agency for Health Care Administration.

Midwives at the birth center also were calling 911 and requesting paramedics to be on “standby” — leading to a rift with local first responders.

“How many examples of bad outcomes do we need before the community, medical leadership and state leadership go ‘Now we get it’?” Kyle Garner, a physician with Gulf Coast Obstetrics and Gynecology, previously said of Rosemary’s care. “How many major complications are we going to tolerate in Sarasota?”

The birth home has a troubled history that includes at least three infant deaths, including that of Baby V, and a rash of hospital transfers. At least one of the deaths was because of a congenital heart defect and not preventable, according to that child’s mother.

In the most recent incident, which was profiled by GateHouse Media and the Herald-Tribune, midwife Jordan Shockley attempted to deliver a footling breech baby on Jan. 30 at the birth center instead of immediately consulting a physician or transferring the laboring mother to the hospital, as state regulations require.

The baby’s lower half emerged, but his head became stuck in the birth canal and he went into distress. Paramedics rushed mother and child to Sarasota Memorial Hospital, performing chest compressions on his partially exposed body after he went into cardiac arrest.

Brenden Charles Fisher was delivered with no pulse or heart beat and had to be revived at the hospital. He suffered severe brain damage and spent several weeks at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg.

The state Department of Health launched a preliminary investigation into the incident, according to the mother, Paris Bean, who said she received calls from the agency seeking information. The department declined to confirm or deny such an investigation.

When the joint investigation, “Failure to Deliver,” was published in November, Bean said, she defended the birth center. After her experience, she said it needed to be shut down.

“I have chills from all these moms that went through a similar situation,” she said. “This can’t happen to anyone ever again.”

Rosemary Birthing Home opened in 2003 and was originally owned by state-licensed midwife Heidi Dahlborg. Miller took over in 2007. She was in the process of transferring ownership to a yet another midwife when the latest incident occurred, according to the website.

“For the last nine months we have worked toward that end,” the website said. “That is no longer happening.”

Although the website does not name the other midwife, Holmes said Shockley was the one preparing to take over the business.

Shockley started training at Rosemary as a student midwife while attending the Florida School of Traditional Midwifery, according to an earlier version of the birth center’s website. When she received her state license in November, she became a permanent part of the team.

Prior to joining Rosemary, Shockley had trained under Holmes, who said she had several concerns about the student midwife and “dismissed her” from her internship.

Holmes said she shared those concerns with both the school and with Miller.

No one at the Florida School of Traditional Midwifery, based in Gainesville, could be reached for comment late Tuesday.

Shockley also did not return a call for comment Tuesday.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190416/sarasotas-rosemary-birthing-home-to-close?rssfeed=true,2019-04-16T19:12:47Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236
731,Check out the latest in pet gear from the 2019 Global Pet Expo in Orlando,"Canine influencer Vienna takes us on a tour of this year's Global Pet Expo

Hello, humans! Wiener influencer Vienna (as in sausage) here. I’ve been sniffing through all the good stuff at the American Pet Products Association’s Global Pet Expo this year. Exciting stuff!

This year marked record-setting attendance numbers for Global Pet Expo in Orlando, with more than 17,000 people and an undisclosed number of dogs, cats, bunnies, pigs and chickens ogling the 3,604 booths. It takes humans three days to get through the humungous show, because the pet industry is big business, with 67 percent of U.S. households spending $72.56 billion last year in pet supplies.

Some of the products I saw made me drool, but I gotta admit, others left me scratching my head. Here are some of the cooler goodies, so you can get shopping.

Keeping us well dressed

Dressing pets in apparel and costumes has become a major trend over the past few years.

Pet Krewe, based in that original party town, New Orleans, exhibited costumes to “unleash the parade” A comprehensive augmented reality app, Pet Krewe GO, accompanies each costume and allows users to create videos for social media starring their furry friends. For example, when a pet parent purchases a mermaid costume for their pooch, they get a code that links to an AR world where the mermaid doggo is surrounded by waves, reefs, and jellyfish.

The company also donates 10 percent of their profits to animal shelters and other pet causes and only uses adoptable shelter animals as their costume models, which helps significantly in getting them placed in forever homes. Petkrewe.com

Keeping us clean

At almost 20 years of age, The Rockster street dog not only is still going strong, he is still going after the ladies (he fathered a litter in 2016), which says a lot about the superfood he has been fed all these years. The Rockster’s humans, Zoe and Sven Ley, found him in Naples, Italy, during their honeymoon in 2004. They cancelled their honeymoon to rescue him, but the problem was that he refused commercial food.

The couple, who must be the best pet parents ever, set to creating pet food using theories on immunological responses from Zoe’s late godfather, Noble Prize winner for Medicine Sir John Vane. The special food transformed The Rockster. The family eventually went into production of Rockster superfood, which combines quality antibiotic- and growth hormone-free meats with a combination of superfoods such as quinoa, lingonberries, chia seeds and green-lipped mussels instead of fillers.

732,16 people shot accidentally in Volusia-Flagler in 2018; some were children,"How one bullet can alter a life.

A .45-caliber bullet pierced Amarion McDuffie’s chin, blasted his jawbone to bits and exited just below his right ear.

By the time Keosha McDuffie saw her 12-year-old son, there was so much blood she couldn’t pinpoint its source.

“His body was jumping on the stretcher, and they was ripping all his clothes off. He was crying,” Keosha said. “I was screaming and yelling.”

Earlier that afternoon, Amarion had asked permission to attend a sleepover with school friends across town from the McDuffies’ Daytona Beach apartment.

[TRUTH ABOUT SHOOTINGS: Tap here to read all the stories]

[HOW WE REPORTED THIS PROJECT]

Keosha felt uneasy when she pulled up to the host boy’s home on Jan. 6, 2018 — the last Saturday of Christmas vacation. The boy’s mother wasn’t there, and an adult tenant was babysitting.

“I never let (my kids) go nowhere unless it’s with immediate family,” said Keosha, a 36-year-old single mother of four. “The one time I let him go…”

Amarion joined the more than 6,000 people in Florida treated each year for gunshot wounds. Daytona Beach’s Halifax Health Medical Center admitted 58 patients with gunshot wounds last year, Halifax Health spokeswoman Tangela Boyd said. That number excludes those discharged from the emergency room as well as those admitted for less than 24 hours who were not treated by the trauma team.

Survivors often are saddled with long-term physical and emotional burdens. And the staggering financial cost of treatment falls not only on the victims, but on the community.

The News-Journal set out to compile and analyze every incident in which a person was shot in Volusia and Flagler counties over the course of 2018, the first such local study. No single source tracks every shooting, so the effort required that reporters make dozens of public records requests to 15 local law enforcement agencies in order to build a comprehensive list.

Of the 176 people shot locally last year, 16 were wounded in non-fatal firearm accidents.

The News-Journal attempted to contact each of them. Several, including Amarion and Keosha, agreed to share their stories.

Bullets and the body

After Amarion was shot, emergency responders transported him from his friend’s home to Halifax Health.

The hospital, which treats most Volusia and Flagler shooting victims as well as some from surrounding counties, has an around-the-clock medical team, blood bank and operating room for trauma patients, said Dr. Dan Jazarevic, director of the hospital’s trauma department. The hospital brought in “Dr. J,” as colleagues call him, four years ago to upgrade its trauma treatment capabilities.

Keosha arrived as Halifax Health’s trauma team stabilized Amarion for air transport to Orlando’s Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children for surgery because of that facility’s expertise with pediatric patients.

Doctors told Keosha her son’s condition could have been much worse, but his strong jawbone forced the bullet that struck his chin outward and away from his carotid artery.

Such impossible-to-predict variables make gunshot wounds much trickier to assess than other penetrating injuries, Jazarevic said. A knife wound, for instance, is contained to an area the size of the blade, but bullets can burrow into a blood vessel, flow away from the entry point and inflict widespread damage.

“A round enters here — may go up, may go down, may go left, may go right, make a turn — you don’t know where it’s going to end up,” Jazarevic said in a thick Croatian accent. “Sometimes you get shot in the abdomen and we find the bullet down by the foot.”

Numerous factors determine the severity of a victim’s injuries. Was an internal organ perforated? Was a major artery punctured? What caliber was the bullet? From which angle did it enter the body?

And misconceptions abound.

“(People think), ‘Oh, you got shot in the heart. You will die,’ ” Jazarevic said. “No, not necessarily. I’ll open your chest real fast, I’ll probably stop (the bleeding) and fix the hole in there and you’ll be fine.”

A punctured lung may not be fatal, either, because the bleeding stops on its own. On the other hand, he said, “An injury to the major (blood) vessel of the leg will kill you if you don’t come to a hospital because you will bleed to death on the street.”

A common belief, perpetuated by Hollywood, is that gunshot victims must undergo surgery to remove bullets or shrapnel lodged in their bodies.

“Only in movies (do) we take bullets out,” Jazarevic said, unless they’re causing further harm or discomfort. “(A round) can do bad things going in and coming out. But once there, it’s in tissue and doesn’t matter. You can leave it there.”

And there are freak incidents, too, in which people survive suicidal shots to the head or, in Amarion’s case, a close-range bullet to the face.

‘Every angel touching his body’

Keosha didn’t know her son’s friend had access to a gun when she dropped him off at the sleepover.

The boys had been playing the video game “Grand Theft Auto V” together online, and Amarion’s friend boasted that his mother owned a real version of the virtual gun they fired in the game — a Rossi Ranch Hand Model 92.

At the house, the boy and Amarion went to the master bedroom where the gun was stored in a closet. The other boy retrieved the gun from a shelf and it fired. Volusia County Sheriff’s Office deputies determined the shooting was accidental, according to an incident report.

“I was in shock,” said Amarion, now 13. “I tasted the blood in my mouth.”

That’s when he realized he’d been shot and ran to the babysitter for help. The man had been listening to music and didn’t hear the disturbance, the report states.

“I had to call (9-1-1) myself,” Amarion said.

Keosha’s initial disbelief when a nurse called to deliver the details soon shifted to panic.

“Of course there’s me in danger, running every light trying to get to the hospital,” she said. She rushed through lobby security, obtained a visitor ID and ran to the trauma room where she found her son bloody and crying — but alive.

“I swear he had every angel touching his body,” Keosha said. “His jawbone can be replaced. Teeth can be replaced.”

And they’ll need to be. But that will come later.

At Arnold Palmer, a medical team drained the bullet hole below Amarion’s ear, plucked scattered shards of teeth and bone from his mouth and throat, stitched up the entry wound on his chin and wired his jaw shut.

“The doctors couldn’t even describe how many pieces were shattered in his mouth,” Keosha said. “They didn’t want him to wake up and choke.”

After surgery, a tube drained fluids from Amarion’s neck for five days. And then Keosha took him home.

He was stable, but not out of danger.

“The only thing they said could make it get life-threatening was if I did not take care of him and he got an infection,” Keosha said.

She bought bandages and a blender to make shakes and smoothies he could drink through a straw. About a week after returning home, Amarion collapsed in the kitchen. He wasn’t getting the nourishment he needed from those liquid meals.

“He was drinking Ensure, but he needed me to blend up broccoli. I saw him shaking,” Keosha said. “That scared me.”

She quit her retail job to nurse him full time, and her father helped her pay the bills for two months until she felt it was safe to return to work.

Amarion missed the whole spring semester at Campbell Middle School. He underwent a second surgery six weeks after the shooting.

“He was still tasting the bullet, so they had to go in and wash his mouth out and make sure there was no pieces of the bullet left in there,” Keosha said. They also removed the wires.

“The first thing he asked the doctor when he came out of the second surgery was, ‘Can I eat?’”

Amarion graduated to soft food but still can only chew on the left side of his mouth — the lower right side is nothing but tissue.

Shootings’ costs: Flesh and $5 billion

More than a year after the shooting, Keosha has yet to receive a medical bill. She anticipates a big assist from Medicaid. But that won’t cover her out-of-pocket costs for the blender, the bandages, a baby-sitter, the special food, the lost wages or the gas for round trips to Orlando.

The direct cost of the 6,000-plus shootings in Florida each year — which includes health care, law enforcement and court expenses, costs to employers and lost income — is more than $5 billion, and approximately $950 million of that burden falls on taxpayers, according to Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence’s 2018 report, “The Economic Cost of Gun Violence in Florida.”

Amarion endured an unexpected surgery in February to extract shards of bone and misshapen teeth that were cutting through his gums. And he still faces another major operation to rebuild his jawbone using bone from his hip, but doctors want to watch how his jaw grows back on its own first. Then he’ll need teeth implants.

The whole ordeal has left an emotional and social imprint on him as well.

In the shooting’s wake, “my face looked fat,” Amarion said, and he had an eye-catching bandage on his neck for a while. “I wore a hoodie because I didn’t feel like explaining myself to people.”

He wouldn’t leave the house with his head uncovered. He had to get glasses, and “everyone he looked at he was scared of,” Keosha said.

His demeanor has changed, too. “He’s more to himself now. All the energy he used to have, he just don’t have all that anymore,” she said.

She moved her family to Port Orange — and a different school zone — to keep Amarion from crossing paths with his former schoolmates.

The mother of the boy who shot Amarion was charged with improper storage of a firearm and sentenced to six months of probation.

Her time has been served, but the repercussions for Keosha’s family continue to surface. “We’re living in 2018. We know that’s not fair,” Keosha said. “As time goes on you think, ‘Oh my God, this ain’t right.’ ”

736,Boy fishing in Nocatee pond accidentally hooks alligator,"0 Boy fishing in Nocatee pond accidentally hooks alligator

A boy fishing in a Nocatee pond found a surprising catch at the end of his line: an alligator.

He and his friend recorded the encounter on a cellphone.

“I don’t know what to do. Like, we’ve got a gator. He’s not that far from where I’m standing,” said 12-year-old Connor Foard in the video. “I really didn’t mean to do this.”

Foard said he was fishing for bass in his gated neighborhood.

TRENDING:

He said the pond is close to a playground and dog park.

Unsure of what to do next, Connor called his dad.

“Even as a parent, I don’t know what to do. So, I can’t imagine what goes through the mind of a 12-year-old,” said his father, Jay Foard.

The lure snapped off Connor’s line.

Then Connor got a net and tried to catch the gator because he didn’t want to leave the lure in its mouth.

“Because I didn’t know if it would, like, maybe get stuck there, and it couldn’t get out, and maybe he couldn’t eat,” Connor told Action News Jax.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said this is not the right move.

An FWC spokesperson said the safest thing to do is cut the line right away and leave, no matter how small the gator looks.

Connor said the gator he caught was about 4-feet long.

That’s the minimum length for FWC’S Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program (SNAP) to remove a “nuisance gator.”

People with concerns about an alligator can call FWC’s Nuisance Alligator Hotline at 866-FWC-GATOR (866-392-4286).

“A lot of young kids, we see a lot of them out right now fishing and getting involved outdoors. They don’t realize that some of this nature is out there and it can be dangerous,” said Jay Foard.

From now on, Connor is only allowed to fish if he’s with an adult.

Michael was turning 11-years-old and had invited his entire class to his birthday party on April 7 at a park. His family says that he struggles with disabilities and it's tough for him to make friends in school, so he was worried that no one would show up.

741,"Store owner catches hungry teen shoplifting, gives him food instead of calling cops","TOLEDO, Ohio - When a 7-Eleven owner was told there was a shoplifter in the store, the man could have immediately called the police and had the suspect arrested.

But instead, when Jitendra Singh saw the security video and noticed the shoplifter was a young teen, he confronted him before notifying the authorities.

After demanding the boy empty his pockets, Singh asked why he had been stealing from the store. The teen said he and his brother were hungry and needed the food.

""I said, 'Well that's not food. You're stealing gum and candies. That's just something for munching,'"" Singh told CNN. ""I said, 'If you're hungry, ask me. I'll give you food.'""

Singh hung up on the 911 operator that was called and gave the boy food for him and his brother.

""When he said, 'I'm hungry and that's why I'm stealing,' I said OK, he has some genuine problem. He's not a thief who's going and stealing stuff and selling it,"" Singh said.

Singh wanted to make sure the boy's life continued on the right path.

REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Authorities say a 20-month-old boy survived a six-story fall from suburban Seattle apartment window after the toddler landed on the roof of a parked car that cushioned the impact of the plunge.

Redmond police spokesman James Perry told the KIRO television station that the toddler “landed in a way where the car absorbed enough of the impact that he was awake and crying when paramedics arrived” Wednesday afternoon.

The boy was in serious but stable condition at a hospital.

Perry said the toddler was alone in a bedroom, while his mother and two siblings were in another room.

SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) - A nanny was arrested for child abuse after a couple came home to find both of their young children with significant bruises.

Sarai Rivera, 25, was arrested for child abuse and booked into the Sarasota County Jail on Tuesday.

Deputies said the 2-year-old boy and 8-month-old girl were admitted to Sarasota Memorial Hospital after their parents returned home from a date and saw bruising on the boy's neck and bruises on the girl's face and under her chin.

When questioned about the bruises, Rivera allegedly told the parents that the boy had thrown a toy at the girl and that the girl had been kissing the boy too hard and gave him a ""hickey"" by accident.

The children later underwent medical examinations at the Child Protection Center in Sarasota.

A forensic nurse told detectives that the bruising under the girl's chin was consistent with an intentional grab and that the bruise on her ear was likely from a grab or a pinch. The boy's bruises were also consistent with a pinch. The injuries were not accidental in nature, the nurse said.

Rivera later told deputies she was adjusting medications to cope with her depression, which sometimes caused her to ""snap"" and become ""irritable."" She also admitted to drinking rum after the couple left for the date and being intoxicated, the affidavit states.

Rivera said the baby started screaming and crying and she couldn't get her to stop, so she grabbed her by the chin out of frustration. Then she whipped her in the face with a towel twice, according to an affidavit.

Rivera said the boy's bruises were from a tickle game they were playing and that she may have pinched him or sucked his neck too hard, deputies said.

Rivera was booked into the Sarasota County Jail on two counts of child abuse. She also met the criteria for a Baker Act, which was completed.",https://www.wfla.com/news/sarasota-county/drunk-nanny-arrested-for-child-abuse-blamed-on-hickey-deputies-say/1917573950,2019-04-11T15:58:38Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - An employee at South Dade Senior High School is accused of engaging in sex acts with a 15-year-old boy, authorities confirmed.

According to an arrest report, Victor Brantley, 45, of Miami, who works in the internet technology department of the school, first met the victim Saturday on the internet dating app Grindr.

Police said Brantley gave the teen his screen name on the Kik Messenger app and they began engaging in conversations there regarding sexual acts.

According to the arrest report, Brantley and the teen exchanged photos of their penises and Brantley picked up the teen from his home and took him to Brantley's residence, where they engaged in sexual activity.

Authorities redacted Brantley's statements to detectives in the arrest report.

He was arrested Tuesday on charges of lewd of lascivious battery, electronic transmission of child pornography, prohibited use of a computer service, using a computer service to travel to meet a minor and interference with custody.

""The allegations against this individual are inexcusable and shameful,"" Miami-Dade County Public Schools spokesman John Schuster said in a statement. ""Employees are routinely familiarized with School Board policy and kept apprised of any updates -- especially where employee-student interactions are concerned.

Deputies said they were called March 17 to Goose Prairie Road near Lemon Street after James Reidnauer, 30, and Brent van Besien, 33, shot at the children, who were walking home from a convenience store.

Investigators said the men confronted the children on a trail on property owned by a nearby church.

Michelle Sabb, the victims' mother, told WFTV.com on Wednesday that her children had gone to a BP gas station to buy candy, as they do almost daily.

""There is a path behind all of the homes on this road that all the children take to the bus stop,"" she said. ""The bus stop is in front of the church over here on Goose Prairie (Road), and that's the route they take anywhere.""

Deputies said Reidnauer and van Besien fired at least two shots -- one near the girl's foot and one in the air -- before shouting slurs at the biracial children.

752,John Jonchuck trial: Man who tossed 5-year-old daughter off bridge found guilty of murder,"John Jonchuck is guilty of first-degree murder, a jury ruled Tuesday, and should spend the rest of his life in prison for dropping his daughter, Phoebe, off a bridge into the chilly, dark waters of Tampa Bay.

LARGO — John Jonchuck is guilty of first-degree murder, a jury ruled Tuesday, and should spend the rest of his life in prison for dropping his daughter, Phoebe, off a bridge into the chilly, dark waters of Tampa Bay.

He was not facing the death penalty.

Over more than four weeks, jurors heard a tangled narrative of Jonchuck’s mental history. His public defenders argued that he was insane at the time of the killing, driven by imagined voices and delusions, unaware that what he was doing was wrong. Their case was built on Jonchuck’s recollection of hearing an old Swedish Bible knocking, of listening to Phoebe chanting when she touched it, of thinking she was possessed and that he was the Pope or God.

His rantings did not sway the jury, which ultimately decided that Jonchuck, now 29, knew killing 5-year-old Phoebe was wrong. Prosecutors said he was acting out of vengeance, killing Phoebe so her mother could never get custody of her and because he was bitter that his own mother loved the little girl with affection she never showed for him.

Jonchuck’s mother and uncle both said if he was not insane, he should “rot in hell” for what he did to Phoebe.

“I want to tell him I love him, because he’s my son,” Michele Jonchuck said through tears in a phone interview after the verdict Tuesday. “But when it comes to what he’s done, I hate him. He took my sunshine away.”

The verdict comes four years after the horrific morning of Jan. 8, 2015, when the region awoke to the inconceivable news that a father had dropped his daughter off the Dick Misener Bridge, on the approach to the landmark Sunshine Skyway.

Phoebe loved the color pink, angels and butterflies. Her smiling face was burned into the area’s collective conscience. A makeshift memorial lingers at the edge of the bridge.

Since her death, the prevailing question has gone unanswered: Why?

In rendering a verdict, jurors gave their assumed answer: Evil.

“I am satisfied that justice was done,” said Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney Bernie McCabe. “My immediate reaction is killing children doesn’t make one a very sympathetic character.”

Pinellas-Pasco Public Defender Bob Dillinger did not return a call for comment, though his office is likely to appeal. Craig Whisenhunt, a former public defender turned private attorney who consulted on the case, said that as the verdict was read, Jonchuck’s mind was with two of his public defenders, Jessica Manuele and Jane McNeill.

As they embraced in the courtroom, “John told his attorneys to take care of each other.”

A troubled boy

No one knows what was going through Jonchuck’s mind when he raced to the top of the bridge, scooped his daughter from the back seat, yelled at a police officer — then dropped her into Tampa Bay.

Twelve lay people — seven men and five women — had to decide. They deliberated for 6½ hours.

After the verdict was read, deputies led the jurors out of a side door in the courthouse. Minutes later, in the parking garage, five declined to comment on their decision.

5 KEY MOMENTS IN THE TRIAL

Not guilty by reason of insanity cases are very rare. State numbers show between 2004 and 2018, there were 5,998 murder trials that went to juries in Florida. Of those, 111 ended with a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity — less than 2 percent.

The Jonchuck jurors heard from law enforcement officers and mental health experts, family members and forensic psychiatrists. They looked at autopsy photos and watched video interrogations. They missed a month of work, of reading the news and being on social media.

They learned about a lifetime of struggle, scheming and violence. And a kindergartener who didn’t know how to swim. Who begged to stay with her daddy, the night before he killed her.

Jonchuck had always been troubled and temperamental, desperate for attention and prone to violent outbursts, his friends and family said. His parents split up when he was young, and he spent his childhood bouncing between his dad’s and uncles’ houses. His mother, who used cocaine and spent time in jail, mostly was absent.

During the trial, psychologists said that abandonment left Jonchuck angry and suffering from attachment issues.

He got thrown out of a dozen preschools. He was 5 — Phoebe’s age — when his family started taking him to see a doctor, who prescribed drugs to stabilize his moods. He was 12 the first time he was arrested, for threatening his dad with a butcher knife.

In middle school, Jonchuck was loud and popular; he put on puppet shows in the cafeteria. He often had bruises and black eyes. He told his friends his dad beat him, told them he hated his dad.

Child protective officers investigated Jonchuck’s dad four times, but never arrested him. John Jonchuck Sr. could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

In eighth grade, Jonchuck told everyone he was gay. The next year, he dropped out of school. He was 17 when he climbed on the roof of his dad’s duplex and slit his arm with a knife — a desperate attempt to get out of his house, one psychologist said.

That was the first time his family committed him. By their count, Jonchuck has been Baker Acted 27 times.

Born into strife

In many ways, his life — and Phoebe’s death — show failures in mental health treatment and child protective services. Jonchuck had prescriptions, but couldn’t always afford to fill them, or didn’t want to. When he didn’t have insurance, he stopped going to treatment.

The Department of Children and Families knew about Jonchuck and Phoebe, and were called to check on them multiple times. Both were left in their broken homes.

At 18, Jonchuck was bouncing between friends’ houses, working at a strip club, doing drugs. He drank a lot, smoked pot and spice, used meth so often his fingers were singed from the little glass pipe. Sometimes, the drugs helped him relax, friends said. Other times, they made him mean.

“He was a monster,” his uncle Bryan Morris had said.

Jonchuck was high when he met Michelle Kerr, a buxom blonde who was five years older. He told her she was beautiful. “Maybe,” he said, “I’m not gay.”

He asked her to marry him four times. He enrolled at Hillsborough Community College with her, slit her tires in a jealous rage, threw her mother’s wedding ring out a window. “He’d be as sweet as anything,” Kerr once said. “Then go all Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”

She wouldn’t marry him. But they moved in together, and she got pregnant. They named their daughter Phoebe, after Jonchuck’s chihuahua.

Kerr could not be reached for comment on the verdict Tuesday. She did not appear in court during the trial.

Their relationship was rocky, riddled with drugs and fights. Kerr was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis soon after Phoebe was born, and became unable to drive. So when they split up, Jonchuck said he would take care of their daughter.

Phoebe had long, honey-colored hair that had never been cut. She loved ""Blues Clues,"" thick steaks, books about dogs — and her daddy. When she sat on Santa’s lap, she asked what he wanted for Christmas.

Jonchuck dragged her between friends’ houses, his dad’s duplex, his uncles’ home and his mom’s apartment. He filed injunctions against Kerr, trying to keep her from seeing Phoebe. During the month before he killed his daughter, Jonchuck started worrying that Kerr or his mother would take her from him.

That’s why he went to a custody lawyer that last day, before Phoebe died. He told the lawyer, Genevieve Torres, he was the creator, and asked her to read the Swedish Bible. The lawyer called police and child protective services. A Department of Children and Families hotline worker decided not to send anyone to talk to him.

But deputies responded that afternoon and interviewed Jonchuck at a church where he went begging for a baptism. They decided he was okay, then let him go, with Phoebe.

Hours later, she was dead.

Torres said Tuesday she watched the verdict live on YouTube.

“So glad that justice is finally served for Phoebe,” she later said by phone while coaching a middle school tennis match. “It’s closure for the family and everyone who was touched by this tragedy.”

The St. Petersburg police officer who heard Phoebe scream as she dropped toward the dark water shared the lawyer’s relief.

“I am pleased with the verdict,” William “Drew” Vickers said in a statement, “and am glad to have some closure for Phoebe and her family after four long years.”

Battle over insanity

The jurors’ challenge was to determine whether Jonchuck knew what he was doing when he killed Phoebe, and that it was wrong. They had to hear how the girl fell 62 feet into Tampa Bay. And they had to look at autopsy photos of Phoebe’s pale, bruised body.

No one from Phoebe’s family, or any of Jonchuck’s friends, came to watch the trial. His uncle later said he was sequestered and not allowed to sit in court but wished he could have testified.

Jonchuck’s mother took the stand early, for just minutes, saying Phoebe couldn’t swim. As she left court, she mouthed to her son, “I love you.”

His dad also testified briefly. He said he threw his son out of the house at 18 “because he damaged my house, scared my wife.” Jonchuck was at his dad’s house, with Phoebe, that night he scooped her from her bed, carried her into his Chrysler PT Cruiser and strapped her into her car seat. His dad said he saw them as late as 10:30 p.m., and Jonchuck wasn’t acting particularly strange. He testified that he didn’t hear them leave. In court, he never really looked at his son.

Most of the witnesses were law enforcement officers who saw Jonchuck the night he killed Phoebe. And experts who argued he was either evil or insane.

Prosecutors painted a portrait of an angry, vengeful man who couldn’t hold a job, cooked up money-making schemes and planned to kill his daughter at least a day in advance.

Defense lawyers emphasized how long Jonchuck had been treated for mental health issues, and how he became psychotic before he dropped his daughter, ranting about God and making a sacrifice to save the world.

Both teams of attorneys spent a lot of time debating what witnesses would be allowed to say on the stand. Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Chris Helinger kept sending the jurors out of the courtroom so she could conference with the lawyers.

There were a lot of things the jurors didn’t get to hear — including the word “psychopath.” And a paralegal’s testimony that, on the day before Phoebe died, Jonchuck had told her not to worry about his custody case, saying, “If I can’t have her, then no one else will.”

The judge called that a “killer statement.” But because prosecutors hadn’t told defense attorneys about it, jurors never got to hear it.

Assistant state attorneys Doug Ellis and Paul Bolan brought in a psychologist who said Jonchuck had mental illness, but that he knew what he was doing that night — and that it was wrong. Jonchuck told the officer who watched him carry Phoebe from his car, “You have no free will.” After he let her go, he raced south over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, then made a U-turn to elude police. Both of those actions, psychologist Peter Bursten said, show Jonchuck was sane when he committed the crime.

“A guy who, right up to the murder, has some appreciation of legal boundaries,” the psychologist said. “It doesn’t mean he was not having psychotic symptoms. You can have both.”

Emily Lazarou, a psychiatrist hired by the prosecution, testified that she doesn’t think Jonchuck is even mentally ill, much less insane. She said he couldn’t have bipolar disorder because he took stimulants as a boy, which could bring on bouts of mania.

She thinks Jonchuck was malingering — making things up. And if he really thought both he and his daughter needed to die that night, Lazarou asked, why didn’t he jump, too?

The defense challenged Lazarou vigorously on cross-examination, and contrasted her testimony with their own experts — two psychologists and a psychiatrist — who said Jonchuck was insane when he killed his daughter.

“It is never going to make sense,” Manuele, one of the public defenders, said during her closing argument. “We’ve tried our hardest, we’ve listened to it all. It is insanity.”

The missing voice

Throughout the trial, jurors took notes on yellow legal pads, looked at evidence, asked experts questions.

And they watched Jonchuck, slumped at the defense table in a borrowed dress shirt and tie, rocking, his mouth hanging open. They didn’t know that, two weeks into the trial, his lawyers had told the judge that he was hallucinating again, hearing voices. Or that two psychologists had evaluated him and determined he was competent to continue going to court.

Jonchuck never took the stand. Jurors never heard his voice. Except in videos they watched.

In one, Lazarou asks how he’s feeling. “Kind of sad,” Jonchuck says slowly, his speech slightly slurred. What makes you feel sad? the psychiatrist asks.

In the video, Jonchuck hesitates. He says, sniffling, “Because I was her father and she loved me so much and I always told her I’d never let anything happen to her.

“And I did.”

753,North Port foster dad accused of sexual abuse stands trial today,"Gilberto Rios and his wife have fostered 48 children since 2009

SARASOTA — A 64-year-old North Port foster parent stands trial today for the alleged sexual and physical abuse of a 3-year-old girl back in 2015.

Last year, the child reportedly told her adoptive mother that Gilberto Rios forced his penis into her mouth, triggering a police investigation.

In an interview with investigators in April 2018, the girl said Rios “took my hand and pulled me over there,” unzipped his pants, then told her to put her mouth on his penis, according to a transcript obtained from court files related to the case.

Afterwards, she ran to her room and locked the door, the child told investigators.

Rios, who has pleaded not guilty and opted for trial, has fostered 48 children with his wife since they became licensed foster parents in 2009, according to child welfare officials.

His wife, Nereida, has not been charged.

But the allegations of sexual and physical abuse are not the first to be made against the Rios family.

GateHouse Media has identified at least four more suspected victims through public records and court documents. None are being named to protect their privacy.

In 2016, a biological mother complained to the Department of Children & Families that her two daughters had been sexually and physically abused while in the couple's care. But DCF could not substantiate the complaint and continued to send vulnerable foster children to the couple for more than a year.

Then in 2018, suspicions of abuse surfaced again with regard to a young child whom Rios and his wife adopted. The boy began disclosing disturbing stories to caseworkers after his father’s arrest last year, according to a former case manager for the Safe Children Coalition.

And Monday, the adoptive mother of yet another child previously fostered by the Rios family said she also fears her daughter was sexually abused.

The Sarasota YMCA/Safe Children Coalition, the nonprofit agency contracted by the Department of Children and Families to manage the child welfare system in Sarasota County, did not answer questions about how many abuse allegations have been filed against Rios over the years or why he and his wife were allowed to continue fostering after the initial allegations were made in 2016.

In an email, Steve Hurwitz, the attorney for the agency, said simply that DCF handles child abuse investigations in Sarasota County.

He added that the Rios foster home was “closed” the day Rios was arrested in April 2018.

The Florida Department of Children and Families did not return multiple requests for comment.

Gilberto Rios’ defense attorney Jeffrey Young also declined to comment on the case Friday.

But before jury selection on Monday, he and fellow defense attorney Betsy Young argued that allegations by children, especially those who have been through other trauma, are susceptible to false memories and embellishment through repeated questioning.

A database of foster care placements obtained by GateHouse Media shows that Rios and his wife often fostered five or six children at a time and were licensed to accept traditional foster kids under the age of 5 as well as medically needy foster children. The records also show that the couple was paid an average of $1,512 per month from 2013 through 2017 for foster services.

The database may be closed to the public next year because of a bill making its way through the Florida Legislature that would make the names of all foster parents a secret.

DCF worked with legislators to craft the proposal after GateHouse Media and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune made a public records request last year asking for the names of all licensed foster parents in the state.

Rios will now stand trial in Sarasota County Circuit Court following an investigation that began in April 2018. That’s when the adoptive mother of one of his former foster children noticed the girl simulating oral sex with Barbie dolls.

When questioned, the girl said that she had once “bit” someone’s penis, according to court documents. Later, on her way to a therapy appointment, she revealed that person was Rios, police in North Port said.

According to police, the girl’s adoptive mother immediately reported the allegations to authorities, who interviewed the child on April 12, 2018.

Police arrested Rios later that night and charged him with sexual assault against a child. He bonded out on $200,000 the next day, court records show.

During the course of the investigation, North Port Police Department detective Shannon Fortuno also learned of a previous allegation made against Rios in 2016. Fortuno noted in court documents that investigators conducted a medical exam in that case, but did not conduct a forensic interview, “possibly due to the age of the child.”

In an interview Friday, the mother of that child said she believes both of her daughters — then 2 and 3 — were molested by Rios.

She started to suspect abuse after noticing her daughters showing up for visits with cuts and bruises on their lips and buttocks. Her 3-year-old later began bleeding from her vagina and developed a yeast infection, according to the mother, whose name is being withheld to protect her children’s identities.

When asked about the injuries, her daughter “said she couldn’t tell me because she would go to jail or not be able to go home to Mommy,” the mother said.

She added that child welfare officials ignored her requests to have her daughter forensically interviewed to determine the veracity of her statements.

“Everybody kept getting ignored,” she said. “Emails, calls — it was ignored.”

After Hurricane Irma, she moved her and her daughters out of the state.

“My (daughter) is not even potty trained because she’s terrified of the toilet from when she was dunked into the toilet by Mr. and Mrs. Rios,” she said. “If I try to cut (my daughter) an apple, she screams out, please don’t cut the baby.”

Since she made her report, child welfare officials in Sarasota placed at least 10 foster children with the Rios family, according to the database obtained by GateHouse.

A former case manager with the Safe Children Coalition who asked that her name be withheld because of fears of retribution said the state’s investigation into the alleged abuse was inconclusive.

Despite the uncertainty, she said officials often continue to send children to homes with previous abuse allegations because of the severe shortage of available foster homes.

“There’s been foster homes which were less than stellar that we’ve had concerns about and they keep using them because, ‘Oh, well, they take the hard kids,'"" she said.

The former case manager said that’s also when concerns cropped up about the couple’s adopted son, who began disclosing stories to caseworkers about “how he would go to Daddy’s room and they would have candy and have special time together,” she said.

“We had serious concerns that the mother was grooming the child.”

But legal efforts to temporarily remove the adoptive son from the home were turned down by Judge Rochelle Curley last year, according to two sources familiar with the case. It is unknown whether the child remains in the home.

Other people who took in children previously fostered by Rios also expressed concerns, including one mother who adopted her daughter out of the system in 2017.

After more than two decades as a foster parent, specializing in children with medical needs, she said it was the worst case she’d ever seen. The 2-year-old girl could not walk, talk or eat on her own. She looked as if she’d never seen the sun. The child was underweight and vomited profusely.

The mother, whom GateHouse is not naming to protect her child’s identity, feared her daughter had been abused.

“She was just so terrified of public restrooms, our bathroom, any bathroom,” the mother said. “You could see the sheer terror in her eyes.”

She said it took years for the child to gain trust in her as a mother. During bath time, the little girl would cover her privates, and scream “please, Mommy, no.”

“I had to tell her 100 times a day, I will never hurt you,” she said. “I don’t know by whom, but I can guarantee you, that child was abused.”

The adoptive mother was surprised to learn from GateHouse Media reporters that her daughter spent six months under Rios’ care as an infant in 2015, before later spending time with at least four other temporary caregivers.

The state never contacted her about the allegations against Rios.

“They don’t do the responsible thing,” she said. “It’s all supposed to be what’s in the best interest of the child. But it’s not. It’s what’s in the best interest of the agency.”

“The system is so broken. It makes me want to cry. Our most vulnerable children are being preyed upon.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190416/north-port-foster-dad-accused-of-sexual-abuse-stands-trial-today?rssfeed=true,2019-04-16T07:01:59Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236
754,"Cordell Richards' torturers, killers resentenced to life","FORT WALTON BEACH — Long years of torment torment for the family of Cordell Richards ended Monday when Ronald Bell and Kristel Maestas were each resentenced to life in prison for his 1999 kidnap and murder.

In issuing his ruling, Circuit Court Judge William Stone notified both defendants that he had considered all the relevant factors in each of their cases, including their youth at the time and “all evidence relating to the offense.”

A former airman, the 31-year-old Richards had been missing for just over a month when, on March 4, 1999, a 12-year-old boy playing on an undeveloped lot in the Parish Pointe subdivision discovered his badly decomposed body.

Richards’ remains were found chained to a tree and burned. Assistant State Attorney Bobby Elmore would later tell a jury that just enough of the man’s fingerprints remained to allow for identification. Investigators learned that he had been horribly tortured for a full day before his death.

The resentencing of the pair, who killed Richards when Bell was 17 and Maestas 16, was ordered following a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court originally published on June 23, 2012. Justices ruled at that time that mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles were unconstitutional.

“The only thing I can say is my family and I are still just in shock we had to go through this in court, Reanna Richards, Richards daughter, said after Monday’s hearing. “I thank God the judge found the wisdom to rule the way he did.”

Both Bell and Maestas, who are now in their 30s and have spent more than half of their lives in prison, appeared in court for their sentencing.

Bell showed no emotion as Stone re-sentenced not only to life in prison for one count of first degree murder, but also to a consecutive live sentence for kidnapping with a weapon.

Maestas, however, openly wept during the proceedings. She will serve life in prison for the killing of Richards and 30 years consecutive to that for her role in the kidnapping, Stone said.

Both will be eligible for a hearing on the kidnapping charges for which they were sentenced next year, at the 20-year anniversary of their being sentenced.

What would become two days of torture began on Feb. 2 when Bell, angered by sexual advances Richards had made toward Maestas and her friend, Renee Lincks, attacked him with a baseball bat.

The attack began at Richards’ apartment on Marshall Court, off Wright Parkway in Fort Walton Beach. After beating the victim severely enough to break bones, Bell, Maestas and Lincks tied him up and took him out to the Waterford Estates subdivision in Parrish Point, where they chained him to a tree.

Bell again beat Richards with the bat, at one time proclaiming himself “Babe Ruth” as he wound up to club his helpless victim, reports from the time said. Bell poured an accelerant on Richards and Maestas, according to reports, lit him on fire.

After leaving him to die, the threesome returned Feb. 3 to find Richards somehow still alive and trying to call for help. They went to a store, bought a meat cleaver, and cut his throat, then returned the item to Target for a refund.

Lincks, who was 15 at the time of the killing, pleaded no contest to manslaughter and false imprisonment and received a sentence of no longer than 15 years for testifying against Bell and Maestas. She was released from prison in 2012.

Bell was originally sentenced to die for his role in the crime, but in 2002 the Florida Supreme Court revoked the death penalty, stating that Circuit Court Judge Thomas Remington didn't properly consider Bell's young age at the time the crime was committed.

Stone has now resentenced four of six youthful Okaloosa County offenders impacted by the 2012 Supreme Court ruling. Sentencing hearings in the cases of Kyle Walling and Tyree Washington are still being scheduled.

Walling and Washington were convicted of first degree murder in the shooting death of Chrisopher Pitcock, who was gunned down by a third man, Timothy Chavers, during a robbery attempt. Walling and Washington were 16 at the time of the fatal 2010 shooting. Chavers, who was 17, has already been resentenced to life in prison. Christopher Pitcock was also 17 on the day he was killed.",https://www.crestviewbulletin.com/news/20190415/cordell-richards-torturers-killers-resentenced-to-life?rssfeed=true,2019-04-16T05:51:42Z,Crestview News Bulletin,Couple,"638 N Ferdon Blvd, Crestview, FL 32536, USA",FL,32536
756,Triple-murder suspect said argument sparked killings,"On Facebook, Ernst Cherizard told followers: ""IDK what happened all I know is we were fighting for the gun then I lost it.""

HAINES CITY — Ernst Cherizard had been on the run from authorities for hours when he went on Facebook early Saturday to talk about what had happened.

He said he had been planning to visit with his daughter, whom he hadn't seen since 2015. His current girlfriend, Eli Junia Normil, became jealous when he spoke with the daughter's mother, Cherizard wrote.

An argument and scuffle ensued inside the Citrus Ridge Apartments then Cherizard said he became overcome with anger.

""IDK what happened all I know is we were fighting for the gun then I lost it,"" Cherizard wrote on Facebook.

Authorities said he shot and killed Normil, 23, and critically wounded her daughter, 6-year-old Elizabelle Frenel, who was shot in the temple, face and arm. The girl was pronounced dead late Saturday night at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando.

After the initial two shootings, police said he fired two shots, killing Normil's aunt, Nicole Guillume, 48, after she had knocked on their apartment door searching for her niece.

He then ran to Normil's Nissan Altima about 7:30 p.m. and sped away, leading law enforcement on a manhunt to South Florida until he turned himself in to Haines City Police Sunday afternoon.

""I don't have much light to shed on it,"" Police Chief Jim Elensky said Monday when asked about more details. ""He's a monster.""

Jake Orr, a spokesman with the State Attorney's Office, said in the coming weeks the agency will determine if they will seek the death penalty against Cherizard for the three deaths. During his first appearance Monday, Cherizard was charged by Haines City Police with three counts of first-degree murder.

In the Facebook post, Cherizard, 38, went on to say he deserves the ""worst that's coming for me nothing less.""

""And one thing plz Guys don't keep no guns at your home man fr I we had 2 guns one for me n look now what happen I ---- my life up and the one I truly love and care bout I don't think my kids deserve this at all they won't know their mom this is pure evil and I'm not a evil person at All,"" Cherizard wrote. ""I took a great person live from you now it's time for me to pay for what I've done.""

In addition to more details about a motive, Elensky said detectives were still trying to piece together if Elizabelle was shot before her mother. The Altima was found in Miami and planned to be returned to Haines City this week.

Cherizard and Normil had 8-month-old twins together. The girl and boy were sleeping in another unit with relatives at the complex when the shootings occurred, Elensky said.

Normil's older sister, Ania Normil, said her sister rarely spoke about any strife with her boyfriend. She remembered hearing her older brother, Dominique, talk about the couple's spats.

""He told her that if you don't want to stay together, leave him,"" Ania Normil said.

As Ania mourned the death of her sister and niece so did classmates and her kindergarten teachers at Alta Vista Elementary.

In a statement, Alta Vista Principal Celeste Stewart wrote Elizabelle was outgoing, enjoyed dancing and loved to help her classmates after she finished her own work.

""Her teacher said this was almost like having another little teacher in the classroom,"" Stewart wrote.

Counselors were on the school grounds to help teachers and students.

""Elizabelle was a beautiful little girl who was sweet, kind and intelligent,"" Stewart wrote. ""She will be greatly missed by her classmates and the entire school community.""

758,LARRY WILLIAMS: Winter annual weeds a great place to hide Easter eggs,"As a boy in a small town in Georgia, we had a St. Augustinegrass lawn. My dad started the lawn before I was born.

That lawn was still doing fine when I left for college at age 17. I don’t remember weeds in the lawn during summer months. I do fondly remember winter “weeds” in that lawn.

To see clumps of winter annuals in our yard and in neighbors’ yards was a natural part of the transition from winter to spring. They added interest to what would have been a plain palette of green.

It was expected to see henbit with its square stiff stems holding up a display of small pinkish-purple flowers in late winter and early spring. A clump of henbit was a great place to hide an Easter egg, especially a pink or purple one.

Wild geranium, another common winter annual, offered another good hiding place for Easter eggs with its pink to purple flowers. Large clumps of annual chickweed would nicely hide whole eggs. Green colored eggs would blend with chickweed’s green leaves.

Crimson clover with its reddish flowers, hop clover, and black medic with their bright yellow flowers were also good hiding places for Easter eggs. Plus, clovers add nitrogen back to our soils.

I never remember my dad using any weed killer. He rarely watered. The lawn was healthy and thick enough to be a deterrent to summer weeds. But during fall and winter as the lawn would naturally thin and go dormant, winter annual weeds would run their course.

I’ve heard that the sense of smell provides our strongest memories. I remember the first mowing of the season with the clean smell of chlorophyll in the spring air. It was refreshing.

Once mowed and as the heat took its toll, by late April or mid-May, these winter weeds were gone. What was left was a green lawn to help cool the landscape as the weather warmed. We mowed the lawn high as St. Augustine should be, played on it and typically didn't worry about it.

Most people have winter weeds in their lawns that let us know spring is near. Perhaps we worry too much with these seasonal, temporary plants that may have wrongly been labeled as weeds.

Besides, how long have we been battling them and have the result that they're still here? Most lawns have countless numbers of the seeds awaiting early winter to become yet another generation. By May they are gone.

The massive storm system that killed several people from Texas to Mississippi is now barreling east, threatening to spawn tornadoes and other catastrophic weather from New England to the Gulf Coast.About 90 million people are under the gun for destructive weather Sunday, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said.While Sunday's storms might not be as severe as the ones that battered the South on Saturday, they will hit far more people in heavily populated cities.""New York, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta all within the zone,"" CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said.At least one tornado was reported Sunday morning in southeast Alabama, near Troy and Goshen, the National Weather Service's Birmingham office said.""Heavy rainfall may hide this tornado. Do not wait to see or hear the tornado. Take cover now,"" the NWS office said.""Flying debris will be dangerous to those caught without shelter. Mobile homes will be damaged or destroyed. Damage to roofs, windows and vehicles will occur. Tree damage is likely."" But tornadoes aren't the only possible cause of destruction Sunday.""Damaging winds and some hail are also associated with these storms pushing through the Southeast this morning,"" Brink said.The threat of severe weather will likely increase throughout the day, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said.""Some storms may also produce large hail or torrential downpours resulting in localized flash flooding,"" NWS tweeted. The storm system's first two victims were two children in east Texas.The children, ages 3 and 8, were killed when a tree fell on a car. They were in the back seat with their parents in the front, according to Angelina County Sheriff's Department Capt. Alton Lenderman.A preliminary damage survey showed an EF3 tornado, with winds up to 140 mph, touched down in Robertson County, the NWS in Fort Worth said.Multiple injuries were reported in the Robertson County town of Franklin, the NWS said. KWTX reported widespread damage there, including uprooted trees and roofs ripped off buildings.The entire town of Franklin and neighboring Bremond lost electricity, with 3,088 customers without power early Sunday.About two hours north of Franklin, dime-sized hail pelted the Dallas-Fort Worth area.The rash of storms then headed east, where it claimed the life of a Louisiana teen. The 13-year-old boy drowned in a drainage area in West Monroe late Saturday afternoon, the Ouachita Parish Sheriff's Office said. The death is believed to be storm related, the sheriff's office said. Warm air enhanced the atmosphere's instability Saturday, allowing the storm system to rev up more energy and grow, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.But ""the storm is so vigorous that tornadoes are still possible after dark,"" he said.As the storms tore through Mississippi overnight into Sunday, they left a trail of destruction that authorities are still combing through.It's still not clear how many lives this storm system has claimed. On Sunday, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said multiple fatalities have been confirmed in Monroe County, but did not say how many.The fire station in Hamilton was destroyed, as were multiple homes and a retail center.""It looks like a storm came up through Louisiana and into Mississippi and exploded in Monroe County,"" Monroe County Sheriff Cecil Cantrell said.""We were hit really, really, hard. We have a lot of flooding. There are several trees down. We are just a mess.""

760,'I just want him to know that he’s not alone',"Mothers seem to have a sixth sense when something is wrong with their children.

It was just a fever, Vincent “Vinny” Lucari’s pediatrician told his mom, Jordan Lucari. It was January and the flu had been making its rounds. As long as Vinny wasn’t throwing up, his pediatrician said he should be fine.

But Jordan’s instinct told her otherwise.

“I had a feeling something wasn’t right,” she said.

When the fever didn’t go away after a few days, Jordan made an appointment for Vinny to see his pediatrician. The last thing she expected to hear was that her previously healthy 7-year-old boy was having seizures.

“My world was crushed,” she said.

She decided to get a second opinion and was told Vinny was possibly suffering from night terrors. But still, no one could diagnose exactly what was happening to her son. So she took matters into her own hands and began digging through Vinny’s medical records.

“Everybody thought I was crazy,” she said.

She discovered the doctor who had suggested night terrors had witnessed Vinny experiencing seizure activity, but didn’t notify her. She knew there was more to Vinny’s condition.

“I’m a problem solver and I can’t fix him,” Jordan said. “There’s nothing you can do as a parent but lay there and watch it happen.""

Finally, an electroencephalogram — which monitors electrical activity of the brain — confirmed that Jordan’s instinct was right.

In July 2018, Vinny was diagnosed with epilepsy.

“He went undiagnosed for seven months, which worsened my son’s condition,” Jordan said. “I lost my son a year ago. He’s not the same kid.”

Vinny’s condition has not only affected him but his whole family. Jordan had to quit her job until they were able to find a diagnosis. Her father and stepmom sold their home in Louisiana and moved in with Jordan and her husband to help take care of Vinny.

Vinny is now on anti-seizure medication, but it doesn’t mean his life is back to normal.

“He can’t do what other kids can do,” Jordan said. “He can’t go swim without a life jacket anymore. I mean he can but he can’t. He can’t take a bath.""

But through it all, two things have remained the same for Vinny. His generous heart and his love of Nerf guns.

“He has a whole shed for his Nerf guns,” Jordan said. “We have Nerf wars all the time, that’s his escape.”

The family had also planned to take Vinny to Disney World for the first time in March as a part of an epilepsy event, but had to cancel due to the cost of his medication. Instead, Vinny decided to raise money for the Walk the Talk for Epilepsy event that will be held in Pensacola on May 4.

He has an initial goal of $2,000, but Jordan said it would be nice if they could raise more.

""I just want him to know that he’s not alone,” she said, “just to see a smile on his face.”

Vinny’s sense of humor hasn’t diminished either. When asked why he wants to raise the money, he initially laughed and said “so I can spend it on Nerf guns,” but quickly added “to donate to other people like me.”

761,Police officer ensures bullied 9-year-old has a happy birthday,"GRAND RAPIDS (CNN NEWSOURCE) - It's a birthday that a boy in Michigan will probably never forget. That's because Grand Rapids Police Officer Austin Lynema made sure of it.

Officer Lynema and 9-year-old Thomas Daniel became fast friends.

Officer Lynema, 22-years-old and six months on the job saw a 9-year-old in need, capturing it all on bodycam video.

""I was finishing a call on Kindle Street and saw Thomas running down the sidewalk trying to catch up to his bus crying,"" Officer Lynema said.

Thomas, along with his mom and brother who immigrated from Tanzania, was devastated.

Reporter: ""Why were you so worried about missing the bus?""

Thomas: ""Cause I missed school and I really want to go to school and do my work and have fun.""

Thomas loves school, never missing a day.

""Mom wasn't able to take Thomas to school. She doesn't have a car. So I asked if it was okay if I took Thomas to school and she said it was. And once we showed up school, you know, all my lights are on,"" Officer Lynema said.

Lynema also learned this wasn't an ordinary day, it was Thomas's birthday.

""Thomas confided in me that he didn't think that anybody else would show up to his birthday party because he was being bullied at school, he invited his entire class,"" Officer Lynema said.

Lynema and his partner decided on a surprise of their own.

“I ring the doorbell and he comes out of his balcony and sees me and my partner. Comes downstairs and gives me my partner hug. And so we asked him Hey, where's, where's the Where's everybody else? Where's the birthday cake? Nobody showed up and there's no cake,"" Officer Lynema said.

The next day, Lynema and fellow officers went the extra mile.

""I was able to get permission to get Krispy Kreme Doughnuts for him personalized Happy birthday. A Grand Rapids Police goody bag that had shirts, hats, stickers, you know, the works for him,"" Officer Lynema said.

The story made the news and now cards and gifts have turned up from across the country.

Officer Lynema and Thomas, friends today, possibly partners down the road.

Thomas says he wants to be a police officer when he grows up.

765,Police: Teen carrying two loaded guns arrested at Catholic school,"JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla. - A 16-year-old boy was arrested Friday morning at St. Paul’s Catholic School in Jacksonville Beach after he was found carrying two loaded handguns, authorities said.

An off-duty officer was called to the school campus on 2nd Avenue North about 11 a.m. after staff noticed the teen walking on school property, according to the Jacksonville Beach Police Department.

Once the officer arrived, he confronted the teen, who had two semiautomatic handguns on him, police said. The teen also was wearing a knit cap that was found to be a ski mask when it was unrolled.

Police said the teen gave him a series of bogus names before he was eventually identified as 16-year-old Derrick L. Conner, who is not a student at the school or from Jacksonville Beach.

Conner was apparently dropped off in the area, though his intentions remain unclear. Police said the teen would not speak with investigators beyond providing fake names.

Conner was arrested on two counts of possession of a firearm on school property, one count of possession of a firearm by a delinquent juvenile and a count of giving a false name to police.

In a statement, Sgt. Larry Smith praised school staff for their close cooperation with police. “We would like to reiterate, ‘If you see something, say something,’” Smith said.

The school sent out a statement to parents letting them know about the incident, though it did not acknowledge that the teen was armed or had a ski mask on him:

Today, our school safety officer approached a suspicious person who was walking on 1st Avenue. Upon investigation, the officer handcuffed him and he was taken to the police station for further questioning. This is a police matter. Please know our campus is safe and the security procedures in place were followed by all. We are so fortunate to have our Jacksonville Beach Police department on our campus and we so appreciate their diligence in keeping our students safe.

766,Deputies: Man leaves 10-year-old in parking lot after child throws up in car,"ST. JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. - A 31-year-old St. Johns County man was arrested this week after deputies said he kicked a 10-year-old child out of his car for throwing up and drove off, leaving the child alone for 15 minutes.

Christopher Griffis had three other children in the Kia Soul at the time and was pulling a boat on a trailer, deputies said.

A FedEx driver saw what happened Wednesday in the parking lot near a Belk store on U.S. 1 and called the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office, deputies said. The driver said Griffis cursed at the boy as he kicked him out of the car for getting sick in the vehicle.

Deputies arrived and were with the driver and the child when Griffis returned in the Soul with the other children. Deputies said when they approached Griffis and explained they were investigating the 10-year-old being left, Griffis rolled up his windows and yelled that the deputies were holding the child hostage.

Deputies said the three children in the car with Griffis, ranging in age from 1 year to 7 years old, became distraught and screamed and cried. One of them agreed to unlock the passenger door when a deputy asked, but as the child tried to unlock the door for the deputy, Griffis reversed quickly, then hit his brakes, causing the tires to screech, deputies said.

They said Griffis then sped forward almost hitting curbs and ran a stop sign as he got onto Old Moultrie Road, again leaving the 10-year-old behind.

Investigators caught up with Griffis Thursday and arrested him on four counts of child neglect and one count each of resisting an officer without violence and reckless driving.

Physician Mark Robert Gardner is facing four charges including sexual assault by custodian and lewd and lascivious behavior. A 15-year old boy whom he had served as guardian went into detail about how the doctor allegedly molested him.Bail was set at 85,000 dollars Wednesday morning.The 63-year old licensed medical dermatologist who also volunteers at Palm Beach County high schools, according to West Palm Beach police and Gardner's lawyer, is accused of molesting the boy who, according to the police report, would run away from his group home and spend time with Gardner.The Palm Beach County School District says it does not have any record of Gardner volunteering at its schools.On one occasion, the boy alleges, while at Gardner's home the doctor supplied marijuana to him and his friend, also a minor, and after the alleged victim laid down to rest, Gardner got in bed with him and began to fondle him, according to police.According to the police report the boy, feeling weak from the marijuana, “couldn’t fight Gardner off.”The fifteen year old alleges Gardner offered to let him move in with him when he turns eighteen, telling the boy, he wanted to be his “sugar daddy.”Gardner’s lawyer told the court this behavior is not like his client, who has no criminal history.“I can understand if he had a prior record, if there were charges against him previously or anything else like that,” the attorney told Judge Dina Keever-Agrama. “But, there’s been nothing. He’s lived a very clean life.”Before leaving the courtroom Gardner signed a No Contact order. It bars him from associating with the alleged victim as well as students in the PBC schools system.The police report also states Gardner was released as the boy’s guardian in November 2018 but continued to see him. It alleges the doctor checked him out of a group home without permission, under the pretense of being his guardian.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/doctor-who-volunteers-at-palm-beach-high-school-accused-of-molesting-15-year-old-runaway/27093556,2019-04-10T17:39:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

776,Foster dad accused of sexually abusing a toddler stands trial today,"SARASOTA — A 64-year-old North Port foster parent stands trial today for the alleged sexual and physical abuse of a 3-year-old girl back in 2015.

Last year, the child reportedly told her adoptive mother that Gilberto Rios forced his penis into her mouth, triggering a police investigation.

In an interview with investigators in April 2018, the girl said Rios “took my hand and pulled me over there,” unzipped his pants, then told her to put her mouth on his penis, according to a transcript obtained from court files related to the case.

Afterwards, she ran to her room and locked the door, the child told investigators.

Rios, who has pleaded not guilty and opted for trial, has fostered 48 children with his wife since they became licensed foster parents in 2009, according to child welfare officials.

His wife, Nereida, has not been charged.

But the allegations of sexual and physical abuse are not the first to be made against the Rios family.

GateHouse Media has identified at least four more suspected victims through public records and court documents. None are being named to protect their privacy.

In 2016, a biological mother complained to the Department of Children & Families that her two daughters had been sexually and physically abused while in the couple's care. But DCF could not substantiate the complaint and continued to send vulnerable foster children to the couple for more than a year.

Then in 2018, suspicions of abuse surfaced again with regard to a young child whom Rios and his wife adopted. The boy began disclosing disturbing stories to caseworkers after his father’s arrest last year, according to a former case manager for the Safe Children Coalition.

And Monday, the adoptive mother of yet another child previously fostered by the Rios family said she also fears her daughter was sexually abused.

The Sarasota YMCA/Safe Children Coalition, the nonprofit agency contracted by the Department of Children and Families to manage the child welfare system in Sarasota County, did not answer questions about how many abuse allegations have been filed against Rios over the years or why he and his wife were allowed to continue fostering after the initial allegations were made in 2016.

In an email, Steve Hurwitz, the attorney for the agency, said simply that DCF handles child abuse investigations in Sarasota County.

He added that the Rios foster home was “closed” the day Rios was arrested in April 2018.

The Florida Department of Children and Families did not return multiple requests for comment.

Gilberto Rios’ defense attorney Jeffrey Young also declined to comment on the case Friday.

But before jury selection on Monday, he and fellow defense attorney Betsy Young argued that allegations by children, especially those who have been through other trauma, are susceptible to false memories and embellishment through repeated questioning.

A database of foster care placements obtained by GateHouse Media shows that Rios and his wife often fostered five or six children at a time and were licensed to accept traditional foster kids under the age of 5 as well as medically needy foster children. The records also show that the couple was paid an average of $1,512 per month from 2013 through 2017 for foster services.

The database may be closed to the public next year because of a bill making its way through the Florida Legislature that would make the names of all foster parents a secret.

DCF worked with legislators to craft the proposal after GateHouse Media and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune made a public records request last year asking for the names of all licensed foster parents in the state.

Rios will now stand trial in Sarasota County Circuit Court following an investigation that began in April 2018. That’s when the adoptive mother of one of his former foster children noticed the girl simulating oral sex with Barbie dolls.

When questioned, the girl said that she had once “bit” someone’s penis, according to court documents. Later, on her way to a therapy appointment, she revealed that person was Rios, police in North Port said.

According to police, the girl’s adoptive mother immediately reported the allegations to authorities, who interviewed the child on April 12, 2018.

Police arrested Rios later that night and charged him with sexual assault against a child. He bonded out on $200,000 the next day, court records show.

During the course of the investigation, North Port Police Department detective Shannon Fortuno also learned of a previous allegation made against Rios in 2016. Fortuno noted in court documents that investigators conducted a medical exam in that case, but did not conduct a forensic interview, “possibly due to the age of the child.”

In an interview Friday, the mother of that child said she believes both of her daughters — then 2 and 3 — were molested by Rios.

She started to suspect abuse after noticing her daughters showing up for visits with cuts and bruises on their lips and buttocks. Her 3-year-old later began bleeding from her vagina and developed a yeast infection, according to the mother, whose name is being withheld to protect her children’s identities.

When asked about the injuries, her daughter “said she couldn’t tell me because she would go to jail or not be able to go home to Mommy,” the mother said.

She added that child welfare officials ignored her requests to have her daughter forensically interviewed to determine the veracity of her statements.

“Everybody kept getting ignored,” she said. “Emails, calls — it was ignored.”

After Hurricane Irma, she moved her and her daughters out of the state.

“My (daughter) is not even potty trained because she’s terrified of the toilet from when she was dunked into the toilet by Mr. and Mrs. Rios,” she said. “If I try to cut (my daughter) an apple, she screams out, please don’t cut the baby.”

Since she made her report, child welfare officials in Sarasota placed at least 10 foster children with the Rios family, according to the database obtained by GateHouse.

A former case manager with the Safe Children Coalition who asked that her name be withheld because of fears of retribution said the state’s investigation into the alleged abuse was inconclusive.

Despite the uncertainty, she said officials often continue to send children to homes with previous abuse allegations because of the severe shortage of available foster homes.

“There’s been foster homes which were less than stellar that we’ve had concerns about and they keep using them because, ‘Oh, well, they take the hard kids,'"" she said.

The former case manager said that’s also when concerns cropped up about the couple’s adopted son, who began disclosing stories to caseworkers about “how he would go to Daddy’s room and they would have candy and have special time together,” she said.

“We had serious concerns that the mother was grooming the child.”

But legal efforts to temporarily remove the adoptive son from the home were turned down by Judge Rochelle Curley last year, according to two sources familiar with the case. It is unknown whether the child remains in the home.

Other people who took in children previously fostered by Rios also expressed concerns, including one mother who adopted her daughter out of the system in 2017.

After more than two decades as a foster parent, specializing in children with medical needs, she said it was the worst case she’d ever seen. The 2-year-old girl could not walk, talk or eat on her own. She looked as if she’d never seen the sun. The child was underweight and vomited profusely.

The mother, whom GateHouse is not naming to protect her child’s identity, feared her daughter had been abused.

“She was just so terrified of public restrooms, our bathroom, any bathroom,” the mother said. “You could see the sheer terror in her eyes.”

She said it took years for the child to gain trust in her as a mother. During bath time, the little girl would cover her privates, and scream “please, Mommy, no.”

“I had to tell her 100 times a day, I will never hurt you,” she said. “I don’t know by whom, but I can guarantee you, that child was abused.”

The adoptive mother was surprised to learn from GateHouse Media reporters that her daughter spent six months under Rios’ care as an infant in 2015, before later spending time with at least four other temporary caregivers.

The state never contacted her about the allegations against Rios.

“They don’t do the responsible thing,” she said. “It’s all supposed to be what’s in the best interest of the child. But it’s not. It’s what’s in the best interest of the agency.”

“The system is so broken. It makes me want to cry. Our most vulnerable children are being preyed upon.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190416/foster-dad-accused-of-sexually-abusing-toddler-stands-trial-today?rssfeed=true,2019-04-16T00:21:00Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

A jury convicted a Cape Coral man this week for soliciting a child in a 2018 sting that netted 17 others.

Joseph F. Mainini, 28, was charged with traveling to meet a minor and unlawful use of a two-way communications device. The 20th Judicial Circuit trial took two days and the jury announced its decision Thursday, according to the State Attorney's Office.

According to the State Attorney, in May 2018 Mainini communicated with a person he believed to be a 14-year-old girl through text messages and phone apps called MeetMe and Skout.

Ensemble Skater Anthony Kan has a role in several numbers during the show including the Opening March Band, the young boy citizen of Arendelle in the “Frozen” segment, and as a Chinese warrior in the “Mulan” section.

“My favorite number in the show is the Opening March Band,” he said. “I get to do my favorite jump, a triple lutz. I feel like in another life I could’ve been a cheerleader, so it’s nice to live a little bit of that at the start of every show.”

The performer from Canada says he enjoys touring with Disney on Ice, but admits he gets homesick at times.

“Since we’re on a North American tour, I got to perform in my hometown, Toronto, for the first time in my professional career,” he said. “My family came to see me on opening night and really enjoyed the Toy Story segment that I was in. It was a moment that I’ll never forget.”

Kan grew up watching the Disney Channel and every Disney movie as a kid. He said by being a part of this tour, he is reliving his childhood in a fairy tale.

“I’m really looking forward to spending more days performing in the show doing what I love, but also enjoying the time I have with my tour family,” he said. “We’re from all over the world, so I like to take advantage of the time I have with them on our days off in all the different cities before we head back home from our little passport to adventure.”

Pierce Fitzgerald portrays Buzz Lightyear in the show. He said the audience will experience a fun, lighthearted, family show with lots of exciting skating tricks and everyone’s favorite Disney classics performed by extremely talented, Olympic-level ice skaters.

“I’d say that it takes about a year of planning to get the show to this level, plus a few months of rehearsal for the skaters to learn the show in a seamless manner,” he added.

The Disney on Ice show and the character of Buzz Lightyear are very familiar to Fitzgerald. The skater experienced the show as a child and was enamored by the presentation.

“I remember seeing this show when I was about 8 years old,” he said. “I begged and begged my mum for ice skating lessons just so I could be like the amazing performers in the show. Skip 10 years later, and I sent my audition video to Disney On Ice and they sent me a contract straight away. This is literally a dream come true, and also Buzz Lightyear was my favorite Disney character growing up and now I have the pleasure of portraying him. I couldn’t think of anything better.”

Touring from city to city is an adventure in itself for the cast and crew. Fitzgerald said that one of the best times so far for him was traveling to New York to see one of his all-time favorite musicals “Dear Evan Hansen” and meeting up with friends he used to perform with on this show.

Fitzgerald also said he is looking forward to going to all the other cities on the tour schedule and seeing new places that he has never been to before.

“I really hope everyone enjoys themselves and has a great time at our show,” he said.

785,Man arrested after father shot to death while walking dog,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Months after a father was found shot to death while walking a dog, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office on Thursday announced an arrest.

According to Lt. Craig Waldrup, Corey Carnes, 20, was arrested at a home on Kona Avenue and charged with murder. Carnes was accused in a deadly shooting that occurred just around 9 p.m. on Dec. 22.

ORIGINAL STORY: Family searching for answers after man gunned down in Jacksonville

Waldrup did not identify the person who died in the shooting, however, News4Jax records show Thomas Gordon, 24, was found shot to death while walking his dog at the Huron-Sophia Apartments on that date and time.

Paris Gordon said in the months following her brother's death, her family has been on edge.

“We can’t sleep at night,"" she said. ""We’ve been affected so much by this.”

According to Paris Gordon, her brother was walking a puppy that he was going to give his 7-year-old son as a Christmas present. Relatives said the boy has been struggling since his father's death.

“He’s always sad. He used to be happy, and I catch him crying all the time. He knows his father is gone and not coming back,"" Paris Gordon said. ""How is he supposed to adjust to that life without his father, somebody he woke up to every day?”

The Sheriff's Office acknowledged Thomas Gordon and Carnes knew each other but gave no motive for the shooting. Investigators said witness tips led to Carnes' arrest.

Carnes was in the Duval County jail Thursday night on a $1.1 million bond.

The Executive Clemency Board sent a letter two weeks ago to Richard Wershe Jr.'s attorney, saying it has denied the request for a commuted sentence.

The letter didn't state a reason.

Wershe's current release date is in October 2020.

Wershe is in prison for his role in an interstate car theft ring which operated while he was already imprisoned. At age 14, Wershe was an FBI informant in Detroit who helped convict a major cocaine trafficking ring but he eventually got caught selling drugs himself.

789,State builds case against Michael Haim,"Michael Haim's trial in the slaying of his wife, Bonnie, in 1993, began Monday with jury selection.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The biological son of a man on trial for killing his wife in 1993 told the court he had no recollection of what happened to his mother when he was 3½ years old, but he was emotionally shaken when he dug up her skull 21 years later.

""I picked up the coconut object and it ended up being the top portion of her skull,"" Aaron Fraser testified Tuesday. ""I had it in my hand. .... Looked back in the hole and you could see teeth. At that point in time, you could see the top portion of her eye sockets.""

UNCUT: Aaron Fraser's testimony on finding remains

WATCH: Gavel-to-gavel coverage of Michael Haim trial

Michael Haim, now 52, is accused of second-degree murder in the death of 23-year-old Bonnie Haim, who went missing while the couple was having marital problems.

Her body was not found until their now-grown son, who had been adopted shortly after his mother's disappearance, was renovating his boyhood home in 2014. He was tearing out a nonworking pool and outdoor shower in the backyard when he came across the bag of remains buried in the ground.

A .22-caliber shell was also found near the body, he said, and Michael Haim owned a .22-caliber rifle.

Although a medical examiner could not confirm how she was killed, Assistant State Attorney Alan Mizrahi told the jury that Michael Haim shot her and then buried her there in 1993.

""The truth was always out there, buried in their backyard,"" Mizrahi said in opening statements in the murder trial. ""The defendant's actions before the killing and after the killing demonstrate his depraved indifference to Bonnie Haim's life.""

Haim's defense attorney, Janis Warren, told the jury that prosecutors do not have enough evidence to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

""We agree she's dead. We agree that's her body in the backyard. But they have to prove to you that he did it,"" she said. ""When you listen to the evidence, ladies and gentlemen, and when you're finished, you're gonna see the lack of evidence in this case far outweighs any evidence they brought you.""

While Aaron Fraser said Tuesday he does not remember his birth mother's disappearance, he told a caseworker at the time, ""Daddy shot Mommy,"" according to the 2015 arrest affidavit.

That caseworker, Brenda Medders, testified Tuesday about her conversation with the boy in 1993, saying Aaron told her he knew his mother was hurt. When she asked who had hurt her, Medders said the boy told her, ""His daddy. His father.""

During extensive cross-examination, Medders confirmed that she had a bachelor's degree in social work at the time and had worked in the field for about one year when she was asked to interview Aaron.

UNCUT: Social worker Brenda Medders' testimony

Asked pointedly if she had asked the boy when his mother was hurt, if she had ascertained if he knew the difference between right and wrong or if she had tried to determine if the boy had been coached, she answered she had not.

Asked why she didn't, Medders answered, ""Due to his young age.""

""What I was trying to do is gather as many facts as I could, which he gave me many,"" she said.

SEBASTIAN — A Sebastian man arrested Tuesday after a search turned up hundreds of images of child pornography was charged in connection with the molestation of a 12-year-old boy, sheriff's officials said.

It's possible there are other victims in the case, they said.

Randall Hitchcock, 24, of the 300 block of Harp Terrace, faces two counts of lewd and lascivious molestation on a child 12 to 16 years old. He was being held Wednesday at the Indian River County Jail on $200,000 bail.

793,"Hey, hey, it's a Monkee: Micky Dolenz talks early years of original boy band","They were the first boy band, a throwback version of ""Glee"" that began as a television show and also created memorable music.

Micky Dolenz of the Monkees sang hits including ""I'm A Believer"" and ""Last Train to Clarksville,"" and recalled his time with bandmates Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork as wonderful years.

Dolenz's concert is April 14 at the Southwest Florida Event Center in Bonita Springs.

""We became like siblings,"" Dolenz said in a recent telephone interview. ""I spent probably more time with those other three guys than I did my siblings over the decades.”

He’s one of two remaining band members, with the recent death of Peter Tork and the 2012 passing of Davy Jones. Nesmith is the other living Monkees' member.

The four formed first as actors on the situational comedy TV series ""The Monkees"" on NBC, where the four set out to become a popular band with funny, quirky skits and with silliness built into every episode. ""The Monkees"" ran from September 1966 to March 1968, but has lived on for decades in syndication.

But unlike many bands, they didn't know each other before forming. The Monkees were the brainchild of film writers and producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, who wanted to create a made-for-TV band. The two were inspired by the Beatles' 1964 movie ""A Hard Day's Night.""

Dolenz auditioned for a part in the TV series, along with Jones, Nesmith and Tork and some 400 others. Jones was performing in ""Oliver"" on Broadway, Nesmith had a record deal and Tork was a singer-songwriter, Dolenz said.

None had known each other before the auditions.

About 20 years old at the time, Dolenz had auditioned for other musical acting roles but was intrigued with the Monkees' concept.

“I do remember thinking this is different, this is really interesting and that I hope I get this one,"" Dolenz said. The show for it's time was ""incredibly unique,"" he added.

“You just do your best and surround yourself with people doing their best and are talented and are working hard,"" Dolenz continued. ""TV producers were looking for that kind of chemistry and that sort of happens or not.”

The four young actors began to gel and develop their music. Dolenz was cast as a vocalist and drummer, even though he wasn't one, pointing out he performed Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode"" on guitar during his Monkees audition (he learned to play classical guitar as a child).

They recorded the Monkees' theme song with Dolenz singing lead. Record producers and songwriters also joined in to make the show and band a success. Neil Diamond wrote ""I'm A Believer"" for the Monkees, and the song reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the last week of 1966.

Other songwriters included other successful musicians, including Neil Sedaka and Paul Williams. Carole King and Gerry Goffin, married at the time, penned ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"" that became one of the Monkees' most successful songs when it was released in July 1967.

Carole Bayer Sager and Sedaka wrote a lesser hit, ""When Love Comes Knocking At Your Door"" and David Gates later of Bread wrote ""Saturday's Child.""

John Stewart, at the time with the Kingston Trio, wrote ""Daydream Believer"" that reached No. 1 in late 1967 and remained there for a month.

Academy Award-winning actor Jack Nicholson even did his part, co-writing a Monkees' 1968 satirical film ""Head"" that was not a commercial success.

It was the TV show that was the focus of the band and most identify with the series through the songs. Their first single, ""Last Train to Clarksville,"" released in August 1966 just weeks prior to the series' TV broadcast debut.

Then the band's first album, ""The Monkees,"" dropped a month later and spent 13 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard, where it would remain on the charts for 78 weeks.

With the TV success, the Monkees eventually toured and that's when Dolenz had to actually learn to play drums. They toured in 1967 with a young, not-yet-famous guitarist named Jimi Hendrix opening for them.

“He was a young quiet, very nice kid,"" Dolenz said of Hendrix, a rock legend many consider the greatest guitarist of all time.

“We would hang out and do stuff after the show on days off. He was a lovely person.”

The Monkees endured until 1971 when they broke up but would later join for reunions and performances.

Before ""Fame' and ""Glee,"" and the Backstreet Boys and the Jonas Brothers, the Monkees could be considered pioneers for teen musical shows and ""boy"" bands, although some would claim the Jackson 5 and The Osmonds hold that honor.

Even so, fans of the band, musical writers and others have pushed for the Monkees to enter the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.

“I’ve never chased awards and banners and things like that,"" Dolenz said.

“Those songs have lasted decades, as great songs will. I always put that down to the writers. I always acknowledge the writers of the songs because we had some of the best in the world.”

Micky Dolenz of the Monkees will perform April 14, 2019, at the Southwest Florida Performing Arts Center in Bonita Springs, Florida. (Photo: Photo courtesy of David Salidor Co.)

Dolenz still performs occasionally with Nesmith, as then two recently toured. He said the February death of Tork was unfortunate but expected because he had been sick for a while.

""Davy’s passing was. That was a big shock,"" Dolenz said of Jones' death in 2012 of oa heart attack at his home near Stuart, Florida.

Dolenz said his show Sunday in Bonita will include all the Monkees' hits, especially because he sang lead on most of them.

""I do them in their entirety, no medlies,"" he noted.

Fond of the Sunshine State, Dolenz said he visited Naples in 1975 with his wife at the time and enjoyed its (then) small-town, beachside vibe.

""We loved that place and talked about it for years after,"" he said.

He said he's eager to revisit Southwest Florida.

“We just caught lightning in a bottle,"" Dolenz said, reflecting on the Monkees' success.

""Our personalities were all different. That was intentional. They didn’t want us to be stepping on each other’s personalities. And we did have a lot of fun, that’s for sure.""

He hopes when people listen to their music, as many first did in the mid-1960s, that it will bring them joy.

“That was the plan,"" he said. ""We’re too busy singing to put anybody down. It says it all in the theme song.”

795,Dominatrix tells Florida lawmakers: Don't hurt consensual sex work,"CLOSE Attorneys representing the New England Patriots owner want a judge to block the release of video that police say shows them engaging in sexual acts. AP

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A professional dominatrix urged Florida lawmakers Tuesday not to hurt consensual sex workers as the Legislature considers bills addressing human trafficking.

""I am your neighbor, I am your co-worker, I am the person in the grocery store. I am also a consensual sex worker,"" said Grace Taylor of Pinellas County, who said she began work as a dominatrix about 20 years ago so she could afford to send her sons to Philmont Boy Scout Ranch. ""And as such, I am your first line of defense in helping you find those who have been trafficked.""

She and fellow sex-worker Kristen Cain told the House Criminal Justice Committee there's a difference between people who choose to work in the sex industry and those forced into the trade. They testified before the committee approved two bills aimed at addressing the problem of human trafficking — an issue that's gained more attention after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with paying for sex as part of a Florida investigation into massage parlor prostitution.

""Sex work does not equate to human trafficking. Conflating the two is dangerous for both victims of human trafficking and sex workers,"" Cain said. ""Listen to sex workers. We are here to help you.""

A bill sponsored by Republican Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen would create a statewide council to focus on human trafficking and require massage parlor employees and hotel front desk and housekeeping staff be trained to recognize signs of human trafficking. A second bill sponsored by Republican Rep. Toby Overdorf would create a mandatory 10-day jail sentence for anyone convicted of soliciting a prostitute and an additional 30-day sentence if the person solicited is a human trafficking victim.

Both bills were approved. Overdorf mentioned the investigation that snared Kraft and about 300 other men in arguing for his bill. He said he hopes his bill will reduce demand for paid sex.

""Mr. Kraft's unfortunate choices certainly have raised the awareness of what human trafficking is in the state of Florida and how prevalent it is throughout our entire society,"" Overdorf said after the meeting. ""It's a scourge that's really affecting the state of Florida.""

More: It's not just the Florida spa investigation allegedly tied to Robert Kraft. Sex trafficking is rampant across US

But Christine Hanavan of the Sex Worker Outreach Project told the committee that laws aimed at punishing men who seek out prostitutes don't work.

""Criminalization is the root cause of trafficking. Prohibition did not end drinking and it can't end sex work. What it can do is make it more dangerous,"" said Hanavan, who isn't a sex worker but advocates for them. ""Sex workers should be your best resource for fighting violence and exploitation in the sex industry. We need to stop going after men who pay for sex and go after the men who think they can just take it.""

But despite the offers to help, Fitzenhagen said she wasn't interested.

""In case it was lost on you, a consensual sex worker, a.k.a. a prostitute, is committing a crime,"" Fitzenhagen told the committee. ""It is not my intent to work with them moving forward.""

After the meeting, Taylor said she isn't a prostitute, but rather dresses up to create a fantasy for her clients.

""Professional dominatrix is not illegal,"" Taylor said.

Police say a 6-year-old Florida boy died after finding a loaded handgun inside a home and shooting himself in the head.

Miami Gardens Police officer Carolyn Frasier told reporters the shooting happened Saturday morning when the boy was with two caregivers. His parents were not present. She did not release the boy's name.

Frasier said investigators are still determining what happened. No one has been charged, but under Florida law a gun owner must take reasonable steps to assure firearms are not accessible by any child 15 or under.

805,150 years: Gainesville goes from cow town to university hub,"Outmaneuvering Lake City to become UF's home was overriding factor in Gainesville's development.

Gainesville is celebrating its 150th birthday today and to understand the city as it is now, a trip back in time would be appropriate.

The Civil War ended but oppression of blacks didn’t — “Young Men’s Democratic” clubs flourished as covers for the Ku Klux Klan, and blacks were lynched. The racial disparities that exist today are rooted in the time of the city’s founding.

Vagrancy and theft were the big crime issues of the day. They are still issues today.

One of Gainesville’s oldest businesses, Chestnut Funeral Home, was started by descendants of emancipated slave Johnson Chestnut from the plantation of Thomas and Serena Haile. He served on Gainesville’s city commission, the first in a Chestnut political dynasty that has included modern city and county commissioners, Alachua County School Board members and state representatives.

Boulware Springs on Southeast 15th Street was a popular recreation spot in the 1860s. It still is — the trailhead for the Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail is there. It is also a gateway to the popular La Chua Trail in Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park.

And an area on the southern end of downtown was a hub of activity because of the railroad, from which the major crops of citrus and cotton were shipped. In 1864 it was the site of a Civil War skirmish. Now it is Depot Park, the city’s beloved gathering spot.

“Without the railroad Gainesville wouldn’t exist,” said historian Peggy Macdonald. “When you go to Depot Park, it’s such a beautiful place and it’s so fun for families, but you are surrounded by history — that history of the Civil War which was fought in and around downtown Gainesville.”

Gainesville as a formal city is older than its 1869 incorporation, and ignoring that is ignoring tumultuous events that continue to echo in Gainesville today.

For the record, the Gainesville was officially established in 1854. It was first incorporated in 1866, a year after the Civil War ended. Florida was under military rule until 1867 and the next year, the state ordered all cities to re-incorporate. So in 1869 Gainesville became officially a city once again.

“If the birthday is 2019, then Gainesville has had a facelift and might be lying about its age,” Macdonald said. “It was a fascinating time in Gainesville’s history, and certainly worth celebrating.”

Flagler's railroad allows

Gainesville county-seat status

It was the chugging railroad that got residents to switch the county seat from Newnansville (near what is now Alachua) to Gainesville.

Henry Flagler was laying train tracks linking the Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico on a route though Gainesville and Archer on its way to Cedar Key.

Like a lot of good things do, the idea of moving the county seat from Newnansville near Alachua to Gainesville — and establishing Gainesville as a city — started at a barbecue. It was at Boulware Springs in 1853.

“It was a no-brainer. The fact that Gainesville was established is due entirely to the construction of the Florida Railroad,” Macdonald said. “It took time for Gainesville to get going but because the people from the other towns had to come to Gainesville to do business, to ship goods and receive goods. It lined the coffers of the people in Gainesville. The Gainesville businesses did well.”

Contrary to legend, Gainesville was never named Hogtown. That was a settlement near what is now Westside Park.

Still, Gainesville had a lot of hogs. Swine beached in Florida with the Spaniards, and their descendant feral hogs wandered the streets. They had a particular liking for the cool crawl space under the courthouse before it was skirted to keep them out.

But Gainesville never made money off hogs. Cattle was the lucrative livestock — water was diverted off Paynes Prairie so it could become a 10,000-head cattle ranch. Sheep were also raised.

Cotton was grown with slave labor on plantations around the county — Haile was an actual plantation before it became a subdivision.

For a time immediately after the Civil War freed blacks and whites lived, if not side by side, at least relatively peaceably.

Josiah T. Walls, an emancipated slave, came to Gainesville to teach at the school of the Freedmen’s Bureau — the bureaus were created by the federal government to help former slaves and poor whites after the war. Walls was the first black elected to Congress.

Walls was a Republican, the party of Abraham Lincoln that supported the abolition of slavery. Bickering about race issues existed in the party then but Democrats were overtly racist.

During Reconstruction, whites had to take a loyalty oath to the U.S. to register to vote. Many whites, still bitter about the defeat of the Confederacy, refused. They were disenfranchised from voting while blacks were able to vote for the first time.

But Gainesville joined the rest of the South in segregating blacks, snuffing out civil rights and acting with violence.

“Intimidation of the black and white Republicans was extensive, extending even to murder,” Charles H. Hildreth wrote in ‘A History of Gainesville.’ “The daring of the murderers knew no bounds. In one instance a white man rode into a local store and calmly shot his victim.”

Lynchings occurred. Rarely, if ever, was anyone held accountable.

Public schools didn’t exist when Gainesville was founded. Separate private schools for blacks and whites were created. The black school, the Union Academy, flourished until separate public schools were built for whites and blacks in the early 1920s, said Albert E. White, president of the Lincoln High School Alumni Association.

“(Union Academy) went to the eighth grade, and at some point they went to the 10th grade,” White said. “In 1922, there were 500 students in the Union Academy. They didn’t have many teachers. It was a two-story building on Northwest Second Street. It looked more like a house or church than a school.”

Charles Chestnut III, who runs the funeral home his family started more than 100 years ago, said the slavery of his ancestors was not discussed when he was a boy.

But he remembers living in a segregated society and became a leader in the movement to crush it.

After serving in the Army and attending a mortuary school in Philadelphia, Chestnut returned to Gainesville and was an early civil rights leader.

“I came back here in 1961 and that’s when I was very involved in the movement,” Chestnut said. “My experiences in Philadelphia — how I was treated there and how I was treated here were very, very different.”

UF's affect on city:

'Berkeley of the South'



The railroad was the first economic engine and transformer of Gainesville. Next was the decision to locate the University of Florida in town.

An early incarnation of UF was in Lake City but the town-gown relationship was often full of animosity, said UF historian and archivist Carl Van Ness.

In 1905 the Florida House of Representatives agreed to create four institutions of higher learning — the University of the State of Florida for Men, the Florida Female College, the Florida Normal and Industrial College for Negroes and the Blind, Deaf and Dumb Institute.

Gainesville city officials decided to try to wrest UF from Lake City. Both offered land and money. But Gainesville offered one more enticement — water at no charge, pumped from the city’s water works at Boulware Springs.

Gainesville won on a 6 to 4 vote of the Board of Control and the Board of Education, though Van Ness said UF never got the free water.

Within 20 years, Gainesville’s economy evolved from primarily agriculture to one based on UF — its students, staff, growth and the businesses that cater to them.

“A lot of people ask what Gainesville would be like without the University of Florida. It’s the simplest question to answer — get on Interstate 75, go 45 miles north and get off at Lake City,” Van Ness said. “One thing you can’t stress enough is that this is a comprehensive university. We are a land-grant institution so we have the engineering, the agriculture, the medical school. We have everything, and that is not typical of most universities.”

As UF continued to grow, its impact grew as well. It is the single largest employer in the county and the money it generates waves throughout the county.

Over time with the addition of Shands Hospital, UF was the catalyst for the medical industry that is an economic lifeblood of the city and county, said Jon Mills, director of UF’s Center for Governmental Responsibility and a former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives.

UF also evolved into a cultural hub with the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, the Harn Museum and the Florida Museum of Natural History.

“The location of the medical complex here generated more medical complexes. That is a significant part of Gainesville,” Mills said. “You have a pretty large cultural complex that University of Florida funding was able to bring together that wouldn’t have been doable without public funding.”

UF also had a role in changing the politics of the city, which became known in the 1970s as the “Berkeley of the South” — after the activism of the University of California, Berkeley. On voting maps today, it is Democratic blue among the Republican red of the region.

Zipping I-75 traffic

changes city again

In the mid-1960s Gainesville was transformed again with the construction of Interstate 75 in what, until then, had been relatively undeveloped and far outside the city’s limits.

Once I-75 was completed, more businesses sprouted along Archer and Newberry Roads at the interchanges. Subdivisions and apartment complexes crept westward to the interstate and now far beyond.

The Oaks Mall was built on Newberry Road. The initial Butler Plaza was a single strip built at the site of the old Stengel Field airport.

Former Alachua County Commissioner Lee Pinkoson remembers Gainesville before the growth spurred by I-75. He had to cope with it decades later as the county grappled with the impact of sprawl development.

Pinkoson played in woods behind Terwilliger Elementary School before they were cleared for construction of the Oaks Mall. He remembers Stengel Field.

“Obviously the interstate had a big impact on the city and a dramatic impact on downtown businesses like Silverman’s, Fagan’s Bootery and those kind of places,” Pinkoson said. “There’s no question it changed growth. People wanted to go out to the suburbs and we had to deal with that as far as people’s expectations of a higher level of service — fire delivery, the sheriff’s office. As a result it had an impact on the county’s budget.”

After decades of development westward in unincorporated Alachua County, Gainesville grew by gobbling up unincorporated areas through annexation.

Now the city is trying to figure out how to grow within its boundaries. Again, UF is having an impact as it expands its reach from the campus eastward to downtown.

A recent attempt by the city to allow increased densities in first-generation neighborhoods including Porters, Pleasant Street/Fifth Avenue and the Duckpond drew enough opposition to force the commission to tell its staff to try again — and to talk to residents before drawing new plans.

Those neighborhoods are among the oldest in Gainesville and among residents' concerns is the potential to wipe out the very history in their streets, homes and character.

“There are a lot of people who are very concerned — distraught — over gentrification. From UF’s perspective it makes sense to focus on developing the east part of Gainesville,” Macdonald said. “But it’s a real concern. The Fifth Avenue Festival, an annual tradition that’s coming up, was started over three decades ago by a group of residents who want to preserve that and were concerned about gentrification. We can see now why they were so concerned.”

Much of the background for this story is from “The History of Gainesville.” It was written by Charles H. Hildreth and was first published to celebrate the city’s 100th birthday in 1954 — the year it was first incorporated. The book was updated in 1979 by Merlin G. Cox.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190413/150-years-gainesville-goes-from-cow-town-to-university-hub?rssfeed=true,2019-04-13T09:01:00Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
806,The murder that chased Canadian spring breakers from Daytona,"DAYTONA BEACH — Scott Edwards has seen the bawdiest Spring Breaks this city has ever hosted, full of public nudity, alcohol abuse and pool dives from top-floor balconies.

But 1996 was the worst Spring Break of his life and it wasn't because of wanton college students.

Something happened that was so tragic, so jarring, that it shut off an entire revenue stream and made Edwards do something he didn't think he could prepare for.

An 18-year-old Canadian was shot and killed at a payphone in Daytona Beach seconds after hanging up with his mother.

Edwards had to personally pay his respects to the hometown of a murdered teen. He had to stand before a congregation overflowing with mourners and then he had to face the teen's shattered parents.

Edwards, in some small way, helped heal an entire town 1,300 miles away — but he was powerless to spare Daytona Beach from economic damage caused by that murder. Canadians don't come to Daytona like they used to.

""That pretty much ended Canadian Spring Break,"" said Edwards, who manages the Daytona Beach Welcome Center, a job he also had 23 years ago. ""Daytona was not the spot to come to. The big Canadian tour operators backed away from it. They just didn't come to Daytona. It shut off Canadian break like a faucet.""

A troubled Lake County teen, one who had escaped from juvenile detention, crossed paths with Mark Fyke, of Belleville, Ontario, who was on vacation and was one wake up away from boarding a bus and going home. One life was ruined and another was violently taken away by that single confrontation at a beachside payphone.

Before he hung up the phone with his mother, Fyke had a gun to his back. The receiver was placed on the cradle and Fyke was ordered to hand over his wallet. The gun was raised and the hammer was cocked.

Fyke, 18, didn't give up what little money he had. He was shot in the head.

The shooter, John Rainey, who was just 17 at the time, is serving a life sentence in prison. Two of his accomplices also served time.

News of the fatal shooting reverberated across Canada, particularly in the lakeside town of Belleville, where Fyke was a high school student.

Fyke's mother told the media she heard a commotion in the background before hearing her son tell her that he had to go.

""The most salient feature of this is the story of a boy talking to his mother. (He) knew that he faced peril and couldn't tell his mother. (He) had to hang up on his mother as he was just seconds away from being shot,"" said Rob Russo, now the Ottawa bureau chief of CBC, who at the time was a reporter for the Canadian Press. He covered Rainey's trial in July 1998.

The murder was newsworthy. So was Daytona's drop-off in Canadian tourism, which is still being felt.

Canadians don't come to Florida like they used to — at least not during Spring Break.

""There was a lot of concern generally about how this would affect not just Spring Break, but tourism in general,"" said Mark Lane, now a News-Journal columnist who was an editorial writer when the shooting took place. ""There was this narrative out there that Florida was a dangerous place and this certainly reinforced that.""

Fyke and dozens of his classmates were in Daytona Beach while school was out for a week.

On the night of March 15, 1996, Fyke died in the arms of his best friend. His friend used his own shirt in an attempt to stem the bleeding from Fyke's head. It was a horrifying scene for those witnesses who ran over to the payphones after hearing the gunshot.

Fyke and his friends were scheduled to board a bus the following morning and begin the 1,300-mile trip home. He had told his mother during his phone conversation with her that he was looking forward to being home. The weather in Florida hadn't been as good as he had hoped.

Canadian students used to show up en masse for Spring Break, which took place earlier in the year compared to their American counterparts. Their visit was a warmup for what Daytona would be seeing a week or so later.

""Back in '96, we were past the heydays of the late 80s and early 90s, but it was still pretty strong,"" Edwards said of Daytona's Spring Break crowds. ""There was a heavy Canadian Spring Break presence in late February every year.""

Two years later, Rainey was convicted of first-degree murder. Jurors recommended life.

Last year, Rainey got a new hearing. His sentence was not reduced. He remains housed at the Lake Correctional Institution in Clermont.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190412/murder-that-chased-canadian-spring-breakers-from-daytona?rssfeed=true,2019-04-12T14:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748

WASHINGTON (AP) — It was a far cry from “I love WikiLeaks!”

President Donald Trump declared on Thursday that “I know nothing about WikiLeaks” after its disheveled founder Julian Assange was hauled out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to face charges, a stark contrast to how candidate Trump showered praise on Assange’s hacking organization night after night during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign.

Asked about Thursday’s arrest, Trump said at the White House, “It’s not my thing. I know there is something having to do with Julian Assange. I’ve been seeing what’s happened with Assange and that will be a determination, I would imagine, mostly by the attorney general, who’s doing an excellent job. So, he’ll be making a determination . I know nothing really about him.”

“It’s not my deal in life.”

But WikiLeaks was Trump’s deal in 2016 as he welcomed the political boost his campaign got and cheered on the release of Clinton campaign emails.

On the same October day that the “Access Hollywood” tape emerged, revealing that Trump had bragged in 2005 about groping women, WikiLeaks began releasing damaging emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta. Trump and his allies, facing a tough battle in the campaign’s final month, seized on the illegal dumps and weaponized them.

“WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks,” Trump said in Pennsylvania.

“This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove,” Trump said in Michigan.

“Boy, I love reading WikiLeaks,” Trump said in Ohio.

All told, Trump extolled WikiLeaks more than 100 times, and a poster of Assange hung backstage at the Republican’s debate war room. At no point from a rally stage did Trump express any misgivings about how WikiLeaks obtained the emails from the Clinton campaign or about the accusations of stealing sensitive U.S. government information, which led to the charges against Assange on Thursday.

Assange for years has been under U.S. Justice Department scrutiny for WikiLeaks’ role in publishing thousands of government secrets. He was an important figure in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, as investigators examined how WikiLeaks obtained emails that were stolen from Democratic groups.

When asked about Assange in 2017, Trump said he did not “support or unsupport” WikiLeaks’ move to release hacked emails and that he would not be involved in any decision for the U.S. government to arrest Assange.

“I am not involved in that decision,” whether or not to arrest Assange, Trump told The Associated Press then, “but if they want to do it, it’s OK with me.”

The Justice Department now has charged Assange with taking part in a computer hacking conspiracy, accusing him of scheming with Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, to break a password for a classified government computer.

The single charge of computer intrusion conspiracy carries up to five years in prison, though the Justice Department can add additional charges depending on the evidence it gathers. Manning was ordered jailed last month for refusing to testify before a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, suggesting that prosecutors are still at work.

It was unclear why the Assange charge, which was brought under seal last year, was made public at this time and why he was taken into custody now — weeks after Mueller’s investigation had concluded. None of the allegations in the case relate to Russian election interference or WikiLeaks’ role in publishing emails stolen from Democrats by Russian intelligence operatives.

An indictment against 12 Russians last year described WikiLeaks’ role in publishing hacked emails in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Though the indictment said WikiLeaks had worked to coordinate the release of information, there was no allegation that the organization solicited the hacking of Democratic email accounts or worked with Russians.

Assange’s arrest provoked passionate responses overseas, and from some who had expressed concern about whistleblower protections, but the initial bipartisan reaction in Washington was relief.

“I’m glad to see the wheels of justice are finally turning when it comes to Julian Assange,” tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally. “In my book, he has NEVER been a hero. His actions - releasing classified information - put our troops at risk and jeopardized the lives of those who helped us in Iraq and Afghanistan.”

And Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, said he hoped the British courts would quickly transfer Assange to U.S. custody “so he can finally get the justice he deserves.”

Assange’s lawyer has previously said he planned to fight any U.S. charges against him. Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012 after he was released on bail in Britain while facing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations that have since been dropped. British police said Assange had been arrested Thursday for breaching his bail conditions and in relation to the U.S. arrest request.",http://www.wfla.com/news/politics/i-know-nothing-trump-changes-his-tune-on-wikileaks/1918117835,2019-04-11T18:18:49Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
809,Man repairing childhood home finds his mother's buried remains,"- Jury selection began Monday for the trial of a Florida man who prosecutors say killed his wife in 1993 because she had plans to leave him with their son.

Michael Haim's trial in Jacksonville was starting this week more than a quarter century after his wife, Bonnie, disappeared from their home. Haim has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder.

A key witness will be Haim's biological son, Aaron Fraser.

As a 3-year-old boy at the time of his mother's disappearance, Fraser told a child welfare worker, ""Daddy hurt mommy,"" or something similar, according to detectives.

""Aaron also stated that 'Daddy shot Mommy,' 'Daddy placed Mommy in timeout,' and 'My daddy could not wake her up,'"" a 2015 arrest affidavit said.

Continue reading below

While Haim remained a suspect, detectives had trouble building a case without a body.

In 2014, having won his childhood home as part of a wrongful death lawsuit against his father, Fraser discovered his mother's skeletal remains while making repairs to the property, according to detectives with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.

A water leak required Fraser to remove a concrete slab underneath which he found the badly composed remains. DNA tests confirmed the remains were those of Bonnie Haim and a medical examiner concluded she died from a homicide ""by unspecified means,"" according to the affidavit.

A spent shell casing found where Bonnie Haim was buried was the same type of caliber as a rifle that Haim owned, the affidavit said.

According to the affidavit, Haim was abusive to his wife and she had made plans to move into an apartment with their son while he was away on a trip. She had secretly opened a bank account and when Haim found out about it and made her close it, she started giving money to a trusted friend to hold for her.

Haim, 52, who had moved to North Carolina by the time of his arrest in 2015, claimed his wife left their home without their son late one night in January 1993 after they had an argument about their marital problems. Haim also said he went searching for his wife, although he didn't notify law enforcement about her disappearance. Law enforcement wasn't told about the disappearance until a maintenance worker found her purse in a hotel dumpster and called police.

""Michael Haim was the last known individual to have contact with victim,"" the arrest affidavit said. ""The suspect admits that he and the victim were fighting over marital issues and that she was planning to leave and take their child.""",http://www.fox13news.com/news/florida-news/man-repairing-childhood-home-finds-mothers-buried-remains,2019-04-11T16:39:10Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609

He calls himself the ""unofficial chairman of the spring break committee,"" which attracts college students to the area and books them in hotels. Before that, he managed one of the largest hotels in the city, so he was around when Daytona Beach was inundated with decadent, beer-fueled college students every March during the 1980s and early 1990s.

[INVESTIGATION: Hotel bookings took a steep dive for Bike Week 2019. Is Daytona Beach’s oldest special event riding off into the sunset?]

Edwards didn't volunteer to go to Belleville. He was pushed into it because it was a job no one wanted. No city official stepped up, no legislator, no local law enforcement officer. The Halifax Area Advertising Authority decided to send the spring break chairman.

The funeral

Bill Fyke, the slain teen's father, had told the Toronto Star the day after his son's death, ""The person who did this doesn't belong in this world. They think it's easy to put a Canadian in a box. But not this time, not this time.""

That's who was waiting for Edwards in Belleville.

Edwards remembered the long drive from the Toronto airport to Fyke's hometown. During his two-hour commute, he listened to a news station on the radio. The only news story being played on the air was the one about the upcoming funeral of the slain teen.

Edwards remembers seeing people setting up speakers outside the Roman Catholic cathedral because of the pending overflow of people. He remembers introducing himself to a woman inside the church. She signaled over the city's police chief.

""He told me that I was not to leave his side throughout the entire service because there were some people who were very upset and they didn't need another tragedy to happen,"" Edwards said. ""Needless to say, it put me on notice that this could be problematic.""

Edwards sat near the front pew. A few people spoke, including Fyke's best friend, who couldn't finish his eulogy because his emotions were so raw. Fyke's aunt also spoke, blaming her nephew's death on American gun violence. After she was done, the priest introduced Edwards.

He stood on the altar and looked across the church. He saw a lot of angry faces.

""It was a tough room,"" Edward said.

He stuck to the written speech he and a colleague had prepared.

""My opening line was something like, 'I'm from Daytona and I've traveled extensively in my life, but today is the longest journey of all,'"" Edwards said.

When he was done, the congregation applauded. It astonished him.

A reception was held after the funeral. It was there that Edwards met Fyke's family. He was the most apprehensive about meeting Bill Fyke, based on the quote Fyke had given to the Toronto Star, which was published in newspapers all over the world, including The News-Journal.

Edwards remembers Fyke approaching him and getting close to him. Fyke paused for a second and then embraced Edwards.

""He broke down and told me those were some of the nicest words he had ever heard anyone say about his son,"" Edwards said.

Edwards had a police escort to the county line. He flew out of Toronto the next day and returned to his office that same afternoon preparing for the next wave of spring breakers who were coming in that week.

The aftermath

Two years later, Rainey was convicted of first-degree murder. Jurors recommended life.

Last year, Rainey got a new hearing. His sentence was not reduced. He remains housed at the Lake Correctional Institution in Clermont.

Rainey's accomplices, William Schmidt and Scott Malone, who were 18 at the time of the shooting, served their prison sentences and were released in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The latter stole the gun that Rainey used in the slaying, authorities said.

""This is one of the few cases in my career as a reporter that stands out,"" said Joe Ditzler, a former News-Journal reporter who wrote extensively about the case. ""The cold-bloodedness of it, the heartbreaking phone call with his mother, the fact they were leaving within hours.""

Russo said the murder hit home for Canadians because it showed them a darker side of Florida they hadn't previously considered. They had always seen Florida as a prosperous, tropical place, he said.

The economic impact that Fyke's murder had on Daytona Beach and across Florida was felt by many in the tourism business. Russo said those in the criminal justice system had that on their minds when they prosecuted Rainey.

""They was clearly a sense that a signal needed to be sent,"" Russo said. ""Nobody wanted to see tourism tempered because of what John Rainey had done.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190411/murder-that-ended-canadian-spring-break-in-daytona?rssfeed=true,2019-04-11T11:34:37Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
811,MARK LANE: Legislature is set to build the road to Sprawlville,"Legislators are getting ready to build toll roads to encourage sprawl in the Florida interior. Say goodbye to a landscape of farms, ranches, forest and springs.

How many times have you heard someone say, “Boy, I wish there were a faster way to drive from Lutz to Mayo, or up to Thomasville, Georgia. A road like that sure would be worth the billion-and-a-half dollars it would take to build it”?

I’m guessing somewhere around, well, never.

How about: “I sure wish a whole lot more subdivisions and strip malls could go up closer to Florida’s springs, rivers and farmland”?

No?

Or: “I sure wish more forests could be clear-cut and springs drained so houses could be built in the middle of nowhere filled with people demanding a full range of government services and infrastructure.”

Not even that?

And yet one of the signature achievements of this year’s session of the Florida Legislature may be a plan to expand the Suncoast Parkway all the way to Georgia. Plus, another toll road connecting Polk County to Collier County. Because Floridians are clamoring for a faster way to get from Bartow to Arcadia.

Ha-ha, just kidding. Nobody’s asking for that except for a few large developers, landowners, construction companies and campaign contributors.

And if that southern route sounds kind of familiar, congratulations, you are an official longtime Floridian. Yes, that plan hearkens back to the old Heartland Parkway, a project environmentalists and rural life advocates have fought since Jeb Bush was governor.

The toll roads would represent the most significant expansion of the Florida road system in my lifetime. And although nobody campaigned for the Legislature on the promise of building all that, it’s on the legislative fast track. That’s because it’s a particular project of Senate President Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton. Florida’s Legislature is very top-down, and the House speaker and Senate president seldom close the session overly disappointed in their priority projects.

The bill would commit the state to spending $45 million next budget year, twice that in the next budget year, $133 million in the budget after that and about $140 million a year in succeeding budgets. If everything goes well at least. Construction would start by the end of 2022. The legislation calls for cars on the road by 2030.

You might wonder why the Legislature doesn’t want to spend transportation money on places where people actually live. Where there’s a loud demand for better roads and bridges. Instead, we’re poised to spend the next decade pouring asphalt for the Road to Sprawlville.

Florida’s cities are crying out for more transportation infrastructure investment. To get going on needed projects that were put off during the Great Recession even as more people and cars kept arriving.

Instead, we have a Legislature that’s stuck in a 1960s mindset of egging on sprawl and laying more asphalt through what used to be the countryside.

When planners talk about “smart growth,” they mean encouraging higher density growth in areas close to existing services and more limited growth in rural and natural areas. This road-building project would encourage the opposite of that, which would be dumb growth. The kind that Florida traditionally used to encourage and underwrite until the costs of doing that became too obvious.

But now we’re about to travel down that toll road again.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190411/mark-lane-legislature-is-set-to-build-road-to-sprawlville?rssfeed=true,2019-04-11T11:13:26Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

The Palm Beach Post reported 27-year-old Christopher Freeman pleaded guilty last month as part of a deal with prosecutors to possessing a weapon on school property.

Palm Beach County School District police said Freeman's son video-called him in tears early last month, saying a teacher at Bear Lakes Middle School ""slammed him."" Freeman told police he then saw an adult grab the boy before the call ended.

815,Riviera Beach police officer disciplined after K-9 attack caught on camera,"A wild incident caught on police body worn camera.

Startling video shows a Riviera Beach Police officer with a K-9 dog as he tries to talk a suspect into giving up.

It ended with the police dog repeatedly biting the suspect. Officials determined the officer violated department policy and disciplined him.

“Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Get on the ground,” the officer says on the video.

Video from Officer John Vanderlaan’s body cam shows what happened last October when a suspect ran away from him and had climbed up on an awning at a business.

Police say the suspect refused to pull over during a traffic stop, then fled and caused a car accident.

“Get on the ground! Get the dog. Get on the ground! Get the dog off me. If go up there, I’m bringing him with me. Please don’t bite me,” the suspect said.

Vanderlaan urged the suspect to get down, but he expressed fears of the dog biting him.

“Get down! I’m coming up to get you. Get down! Don’t let that dog bite me! Get the (obscenity) down! Don’t let the dog bite me,” the suspect shouts back. ""Just get the dog off me! I’m gonna get down, just get the dog off me!”

At one point, the K-9 runs away and the officer runs after it.

Vanderlaan returns to the spot where the man is sitting on the awning.

“Get on the ground. Get down or you’re gonna get it. Get down. Let the dog off me. Get down! Get down,"" Vanderlaan shouts.

Nearly four minutes into the encounter, the suspect finally says he will surrender.

“Get on the (obscenity) ground! I’m surrendering! I got him. I’m surrendering. Get on the ground! Don’t forget I’m surrendering. Get on the ground! Get down,” the officer shouts as the dog barks.

The officer grabs his leg, pulling him through a hole in the awning.

“Come get me! Come get me, come get me,” the suspect said.

Vanderlaan pulls him from the awning and the K-9 repeatedly bites the man as he screams.

Still photos show the suspect was bitten several times on his back and arm.

The video shows the dog panting as the officer praises him.

“Good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy! Good boy,” Vanderlaan said.

Vanderlaan praises the dog while other officers tend to the suspect who appears to be passed out.

“Check for a pulse, make sure he ain’t faking it,” Vanderlaan said in the video.

Moments later, video shows the dog being placed in the police officer’s SUV and the suspect being led away in handcuffs.

An Internal Affairs report found Vanderlaan went too far, violating department policy because his use of countermeasures was excessive, resulting in injury.

He was suspended for 84 hours, removed from the K-9 unit and was ordered to perform 40 hours of remedial K-9 training.",http://cw34.com/news/local/riviera-beach-police-officer-disciplined-after-k-9-attack-caught-on-camera,2019-04-10T02:41:26Z,WTVX,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407

819,"6 shot, including 2 children, during baby shower on South Side","Seeley shooting Seeley shooting

- At least six people were wounded, including an 8-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl, in a shooting Saturday evening on the South Side that happened while a family was celebrating the upcoming birth of a child.

Gunfire erupted at 6:21 p.m. at a gathering in the 6300 block of South Seeley in the Englewood neighborhood, according to Chicago police. Two men in dark clothing approached the family gathering and opened fire before fleeing on foot, police said.

Both children were taken to Comer Children’s Hospital where their conditions are critical but stable, authorities said. The boy was struck in his back and chest, and the girl was shot in her shin, police said.

A 29-year-old woman was shot in her shoulder and chest, while a 42-year-old man was shot twice in his hip, police said. They were taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where the woman was in critical condition, and the man’s condition was stabilized.

The gunfire also hit a 23-year-old man in his foot and a 28-year-old man in the shoulder, police said. They were both taken to Holy Cross Hospital, where their conditions were stabilized. The older man was later transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital.

Witnesses were not cooperating with investigators, but based on the victim’s profiles police believe the shooting may have been in retaliation from an earlier incident in the neighborhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Detectives were reviewing footage from nearby surveillance cameras but had little physical evidence to work with at the scene.

The family was celebrating the upcoming birth of a child, authorities said.

The mother and grandmother of the wounded 8-year-old boy were seen waiting outside Comer, both of them visibly distressed. The mother, whose shirt was stained with blood, was crying out for her child.

“He’s just a baby, he’s just a baby,” the mother said, as tears flowed down her face.

The grandmother told reporters the boy was in surgery.

Meanwhile, in another shooting, a 13-year-old boy was seriously wounded about 8:20 p.m. in the 1200 block of West 73rd. Two males ran out of a vacant lot and fired shots into a car where the boy was sitting, striking him in the hip, police said. The car drove to 69th and Racine where paramedics were called. The boy’s condition was stabilized at Comer.

Speaking to reporters outside Comer, community activist Andrew Holmes called for prayers for the young victims and urged any witnesses to talk to police.

820,Review: Florida Rep's 'Million Dollar Quartet' kills it. And so does The Killer.,"CLOSE Florida Rep's new artistic director, Greg Longenhagen, talks about why he wanted the job and what the Fort Myers theater means to him. Charles Runnells, crunnells@news-press.com

There’s a reason they call him The Killer.

I’ve seen three different productions of “Million Dollar Quartet” now. And in every single one, the character of Jerry Lee Lewis absolutely kills it. And I mean that in the best possible way.

It’s a juicy role, to be sure. And in Florida Rep’s new production of the jukebox musical, actor Brady Wease doesn’t buck the trend. He rings every last possible drop he can from the role.

More: Florida Rep's new season: Patsy Cline, 'A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder' and more

More: Live Music in SWFL: Night Ranger, Village People, Joe Diffie, Mickey Dolenz, etc.

Wease’s Killer is a force of nature, all libido and cockiness and feral, backwoods Louisana charm. Simply put, you can’t take your eyes off him as he drawls and leers and pounds the living bejesus out of his piano (make that his PIE-ano).

Naturally, he gets some of the best lines in the musical, too — delivered with wild-eyed mischief and note-perfect comedic timing.

“My mom LOVES that song,” he says after hearing Johnny Cash sing “Folsom Prison Blues.” “It reminds her of my daddy.”

How can you top such a hilarious, go-for-broke performance? Honestly, you can’t. But the other stars in “Million Dollar Quartet” do their best, turning in solid and often jaw-dropping takes on Sun Records superstars Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley.

The Cast of ""Million Dollar Quartet"" (Photo: Joe Dafeldecker)

Director Jason Parrish has assembled an impressive cast for this rare Florida Rep musical — and more importantly, an impressive group of singer/musicians. Nobody’s faking the music onstage. All the actors really sing and really play their own instruments.

Gregg Hammer portrays a characteristically reserved Johnny Cash, but he gives you goosebumps when he drops his voice really, REALLY low on “Sixteen Tons” (then makes you laugh when he turns to Lewis and says, “You’ll get there someday, Jerry Lee!”).

Joe Boover’s Elvis Presley has a likable charm and some crazy, swiveling hips that have to be seen to be believed. And Jeremy Sevelovitz’s earthy country boy Carl Perkins not only sizzles on the guitar – but in one memorable scene, he shreds on it while standing on top of an upright bass played by Daniel Bailey.

They’re joined by Elvis’s sassy, oh-my-God-I-think-I-love-her-too girlfriend Dyanne (played by Julie Kavanagh, who does a little killing, herself, on the sultry “Fever”), a back-up band made up of Bailey and drummer/music director David Sonneborn, and especially Brendan Powers as the wise and passionate “Father of Rock ‘n’ Roll,” Sun Records owner Sam Phillips.

Together, this smoking-hot cast nearly blows the roof off Florida Repertory Theatre (not really, of course. It just feels like it). And the audience cheers and hoots and claps like these four dudes really ARE Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis.

Joe Boover and Gregg Hammer portray Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash in Florida Repertory Theatre's ""Million Dollar Quartet."" (Photo: Joseph Herrera)

This doesn’t feel like any old musical. It’s a rock ‘n’ roll revival, pure and simple.

The story drops the audience into the famous Sun Records studio in Memphis for that near mythical day when Presley, Perkins, Lewis and Cash gathered for a never-repeated, one-night-only recording session in 1956. That gathering later became known as The Million Dollar Quartet.

The musical isn’t without problems, though. And I’m talking about the script, not the performances. Some of the show’s dramatic developments are a little too convenient to be believable. And some of the lines can be super-corny. “I swear,” Elvis says at one point, “I’ll never play Vegas again.”

Go ahead and roll your eyes. I did. But I’ll gladly put up with a few groaners for a musical that’s this much fun.

You probably already know all these classic rock, country and gospel songs if you’re older than, say, 40. Even the youngsters might know a few from movies and TV commercials.

But these aren’t golden oldies. Not here. Music director Sonneborn and his cast take those classics, kick them in the butt and make them come to sizzling, thrilling life.

A scene from Florida Repertory Theatre's ""Million Dollar Quartet"" (Photo: Joseph Herrera)

Everyone looks like they’re having a blast, too — especially on the crowd-pleasing “fantasy concert” finale that dumps the story altogether and transforms the show into a full-on rock concert with each star taking a turn on one of his most famous songs.

Show highlights — and there are many — include the gospel number “Down By the Riverside,” with all four men's voices blending in soul-stirring, four-part harmony; Lewis kicking his piano stool all the way across the stage as he lays into his piano for the raucous finale; Perkins' sizzling guitar on “Blue Suede Shoes” (a song, Carl will tell you, that HE wrote and not Elvis Presley); and Presley’s haunting, unexpectedly mournful take on “Peace in the Valley.”

It’s a magical, mythical, roof-raising recording session. And yeah, I know, it probably never actually happened this way. That’s OK. It’s cool just to sit in on the Million Dollar Quartet, even a fictionalized version.

Sure, The Killer steals the show. He always did. But there’s so much more to love in Florida Rep’s outstanding “Million Dollar Quartet.”

So go for Jerry Lee Lewis. But stay for the rock ‘n’ roll.

821,"Florida History: Here are Florida’s top 15 moments of all time, with a woman’s touch","Here's a round up of defining moments in Florida’s women’s history from Mary McLeod Bethune to Emma Gonzalez. They are women who should be remembered during Women's History Month and every other month throughout the year.

Florida Time is a weekly column about Florida history: from the Fountain of Youth and Walt Disney to the Miami Riots, the extent of Jim Crow, the mermaid at Weeki Wachee Springs, the moon landing and more. It publishes to 21 newspapers across the state every Thursday.

In the first official segment of the column, columnist and author Eliot Kleinberg shared the most important events in our state’s history. The list was assembled in 1999 by The Palm Beach Post and rated by a distinguished panel of state history scholars.

Even with the passage of two decades, the list is pretty solid. It is, of course, open to reflection and debate. Florida residents, some natives, some transplants responded to the column and it sparked conversation that continues. We reached out to historians, professors and other leading women to chime in.

Mary Martinez, Diversity & Inclusion Strategist and Consultant to corporations, not-for-profits and the public sector, thinks the list is “pretty good” at touching on Black and Native American history in the state, but not so much on women, Latinx and the LGBTQ community or their defining moments. We agree. Additionally, the events are described largely from the historical perspective of white males.



The value of diverse viewpoints is that “the voices are different in not only content but tone and perspective,” Martinez explained.



While these two points don’t necessarily change the events listed, they did inspire another list: In honor of Women’s History Month, here are 15 women and their moments that helped define women’s history in Florida.

Jacqueline Cochran becomes director of the Women Airforce Service Pilots in Miami, teaching 1,200 women to fly. She is the first woman to pilot a bomber across the Atlantic Ocean and the first living woman enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1971. Julia Tuttle purchases hundreds of acres that we now know as Miami. She is the first and only woman to have founded a city. Zora Neale Hurston leads the Harlem Renaissance with a unique writing style and completes ‘Mules and Men,’ a collection of African-American folktales, and publishes “Their Eyes Were Watching God,” named one of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923 by TIME. AnEta Sewell-Spense appears on air making history as the first African-American television reporter in the Palm Beach and Treasure Coast market in 1974. Emma Gonzalez, survivor of the deadliest school shooting in American history, speaks to lawmakers and gun advocates, calling them out on their “B.S.” days after a teenager killed 17 people at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School. The shooting, along with her viral speech and other activism, inspires many national retailers to raise the age minimum for buying guns. Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, one of the first writers at The Miami Herald, publishes a book about the Everglades and coins the phrase “river of grass.” She is inducted into the Florida Women’s Hall of Fame in 2000. Hope Alswang oversees the most ambitious transformation of the 77-year-old Norton Museum as CEO and Executive Director. The museums new design and expansion costs over $100 million. Mandy Moore, a Winter Park native, releases her first album “So Real” in 1999. She later releases other albums, stars in films like “The Princess Diaries” and “A Walk to Remember” and now is known for her role on the popular “This Is Us” television series. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings wins a Pulitzer Prize for fiction for ‘The Yearling,’ a book about a boy who adopts a deer. The book is turned into a film and becomes a breakthrough for what we now know as young adult fiction. Known as “The First Lady of the Struggle,” Mary McLeod Bethune changes the lives and standard of African American men and woman. She is the only woman to have founded an academic institution, Bethune Cookman College in Daytona. Miami Sound Machine becomes Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine in 1987 and Estefan becomes an international superstar. Latin pop crosses over to a mainstream American audience. May Austin Elizabeth Mann Jennings leads campaigns for a better environment including one that became Everglades National Park. Jennings is also a former Florida first lady. Annetta Wilson of Central Florida becomes the first African-American (and African-American woman) to anchor a weekday evening newscast in the Central Florida market. A five-foot-tall, 20-year-old from Boca Raton releases a debut pop and R&B album. Six years in and five albums later, she is one of the biggest singers on the planet. Ariana Grande makes history as Apple Music’s most streamed female artist and breaks Billboard streaming records with her album “Sweetener.” Florida legend Gloria Estefan calls her “gifted.” Moore Haven proudly elected the first female mayor of the south, Marian Newhall Horwitz.

There is always room for more women and their contributions to history. We’d like to ask you, what defining moment, woman or event in Florida history would you add to this list?

Miami Gardens Police officer Carolyn Frasier told reporters the shooting happened Saturday morning when the boy was with two caregivers. His parents were not present. She did not release the boy's name.

Frasier said investigators are still determining what happened. No one has been charged, but under Florida law a gun owner must take reasonable steps to assure firearms are not accessible by any child 15 or under.

832,"Richard Cole, last surviving member of the Doolittle Raiders, dies at 103 in Texas","CLOSE Retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole is 97, but that didn't stop him from taking the controls and flying a vintage B-25 bomber at a reunion of the famous World War II Doolittle Raiders. (April 18) AP

Retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole, the last survivor of the Doolittle Raid, the first U.S. strike on the Japanese islands during World War II, died Tuesday in Texas. He was 103.

Cole was one of 80 men sent to target factory areas and military installations in Japan on April 18, 1942. The daring raid stunned Japan and is credited with boosting U.S. morale and helping turn the tide of the war in the Pacific.

“There’s another hole in our formation. Our last remaining Doolittle Raider has slipped the surly bonds of Earth, and has reunited with his fellow Raiders,” General David Goldfein, chief of staff of the Air Force said Tuesday. “The Legacy of the Doolittle Raiders – his legacy – will live forever in the hearts and minds of Airmen, long after we’ve all departed.”

Cole, born in Dayton, Ohio, was mission commander Jimmy Doolittle’s co-pilot in the all-volunteer attack which took place less than five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

After bombing targets in northwest Tokyo, Cole's plane turned toward China with plans to land at an airfield. But things went awry when authorities at the airfield heard their engines, assumed it was Japanese and turned off the lights. Cole and Doolittle couldn't find a place to land at night.

Shortly before running out of fuel, everyone bailed out; Cole gave himself a black eye when he pulled his parachute ripcord. He landed in a tree where he spent the night, climbing down in the morning, and walking the whole day before finding a couple of Chinese students who eventually took him to Doolittle, who said, ""Boy, am I glad to see you.""

Richard Cole: Last Doolittle Raider remembers historic mission 75 years ago

David Thatcher: 79th Doolittle Raider dies in Montana

Of the 80 men who flew from the USS Hornet deck, three died in the raid, and four who were captured by the Japanese were executed or starved to death. Two others who survived the raid were later killed while flying the China-Burma-India route over the Himalayas known as the ""Hump.""

After the raid, Cole went to India, helped establish the dangerous Hump flying route and flew more than 100 missions carrying cargo, earning three Distinguished Flying Crosses.

The Doolittle Raiders received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2015, and donated it to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Ohio.

Cole, who often attended Raider-related events and air shows, told The Associated Press last year that since he was older than many of the other Raiders, he didn’t expect to be the last.

“I figured that Mother Nature and the good man upstairs would pick the time, and I wouldn’t have any control over it,” he said.

Cole will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the Air Force Times reported, and memorial services are also being scheduled at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in Texas.

A nighttime beach walk turned into a nightmare when a couple were accosted by a pair of thugs, whose gunfire grazed one in the abdomen.

According to a Cape Coral police report, the couple arrived at the Cape Coral Yacht Club, 5818 Driftwood Parkway, about 8:15 p.m. Sunday.

The suspects approached the couple near the playground and were saying inappropriate sexual innuendos, the couple reported.

835,Judge orders psychological exam for teen accused in stabbing,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A Broward County judge Sunday ordered a Coral Springs teenager accused of stabbing a classmate to be securely detained and undergo a full psychological assessment.

A defense attorney for Jayden Hutchinson -- a 16-year-old junior at Coral Springs High School -- argued that the boy should be placed under house arrest, but Judge Ginger Lerner-Wren disagreed. The attorney said the teenager is an excellent student, an athlete and active in the community.

According to Broward County Public Schools spokeswoman Nadine Drew, Hutchinson stabbed a 17-year-old classmate in the leg Friday during a fight over a girl in the school's parking lot just after 3 p.m.

Drew said school employees intervened and broke up the fight.

Paramedics transported the victim to a local hospital. His injuries were described as not life-threatening.

Hutchinson faces a charge of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

Parents of Coral Springs High School students received a message Friday from Vivian C. Suarez, the school's principal, saying both students involved in the fight will be facing ""appropriate disciplinary measures.""

836,Card trick turns boy with autism and hotel worker into fast friends,"- An unlikely friendship between a hotel worker and a boy with autism is melting hearts across the internet—and it all started with a simple card trick.

Colin Haas, 13, was checking into the Hampton Inn in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania with his family where Kahlief Hill was working behind the desk.

The family says Hill was very kind. So kind in fact that Colin went right back to see him. In a Facebook post, Megan Griffin Haas posted a photo of the touching interaction between the two when Hill asked Colin if he wanted to see a card trick.

“He didn’t know that this little boy has autism. That learning and doing card tricks is a passion of his because it helps to quiet and focus his brain as well as keep his hands busy.""

""He didn’t know that this little boy lost his dad a few years ago, has been on the waiting list for a ‘big brother’ for well over two years now, and lives with only his mom and sister, so very much misses interacting with male figures.”

Haas wrote that Hill never once made Colin feel like he was a nuisance or a bother. In fact, when Colin saw that Hill was working the next day, ""he made it a point to let Colin know he was geared up and ready to go with more card tricks.""

The two are now friends on Facebook and Hill has invited Colin to be his guest at an Autism Awareness brunch that The Hampton Inn Selinsgrove is hosting at the end of the month.

841,Family of boy with prosthetic legs sues Legoland claims discrimination,"An example presented in the lawsuit against Legoland of a ride at Islands of Adventure that a 9-year-old boy with prosthetics could ride and a ride at Legoland he was not allowed on.

POLK COUNTY, Fla. - The family of a 9-year-old boy with prosthetic legs filed suit against Legoland Wednesday after they were told by ride attendants he could not ride some of the attractions.

The couple brought their son, who is a bilateral amputee, to Legoland in August 2016 and he wore his full-length prosthetic legs, according to the lawsuit filed in the Middle District of Florida U.S. District Court. The boy is referred to by his initials I.S. throughout the lawsuit.

The family went to the customer service office before exploring the park to ask about whether there would be any limitations on what rides he could participate in with his prosthetics, which are from the knee down. They were told, according to the lawsuit, that there were only two rides their child could not ride because of his disability. The family was also given a hero pass for ""those who may have difficulty waiting in line.""

However, when the family attempted to embark on ""The Dragon"" rollercoaster, they were allowed to board and sit in the ride but after a delay the ride operator approached the boy and hold him he could not ride because he did not have ""one natural leg.""

""All of this took place in front of a large number of other families and individuals, making I.S.

and the Suarez Family feel singled out and humiliated,"" the lawsuit states.

The family went back to customer service and were told they should have been permitted to ride ""The Dragon"" and were assured they would not have any further problems during their trip.

But when the family attempted to ride another attraction that was on the approved list the boy was again told ""without any compassion, discussion, or individualized analysis"" he could not ride without ""one real leg.""

The parents said the situation was very confusing and upsetting for the 9-year-old boy who had both legs amputated when he was a toddler.

The family again went back to customer service and again were told the boy should have been able to participate in most of the rides. Park officials also offered the Suarez family season passes.

According to the lawsuit, the family did go back to the park several times and the boy could ride the same rides he was previously denied, including The Dragon, and other times they were told he could not. On another occasion the boy was denied access to a water playground where infants and toddlers were permitted, because an attendant said he did not have ""three fully development limbs.""

""After each of the humiliating and upsetting incidents ... I.S. and the

Suarez family would attempt to resolve their issues with Defendant’s Customer Service staff,

only to then have I.S. and the Suarez Family exposed to further pain and humiliation when the

Suarez Family would again attempt to experience the attractions at LEGOLAND only to be

repeatedly singled out, embarrassed, and denied access,"" according to the lawsuit.

According to Legoland's own policies, the 9-year-old should have been able to ride almost all of the attractions. He met the height requirement, could sit upright, unassisted and could hold onto the lap bar, according to the lawsuit.

The family claims that their son was able to participate and never treated differently at any of the other area theme parks, including SeaWorld Orlando, Universal Studios and Walt Disney World Resort.

Legoland could not comment to News 6 on the ongoing litigation. A spokesperson for the park gave this response:

Our parks offer a variety of fun attractions for guests of all abilities to enjoy such as stage shows, 4-D theater experiences, LEGO brick building classes, LEGO character interactions and the beautiful Cypress Gardens.



While we do not comment on specific cases, we are fully committed to providing an awesome experience for all of our guests, including individuals with different abilities.



Our highest priority is the safety of our guests. The minimum safety requirements to use certain attractions, rides or water slides at our resort are based upon the guidelines and best practices set by the equipment manufacturers and industry associations. We adhere to their guidelines with the utmost attention and accuracy in order to ensure guest safety in all potential situations

844,Florida to decide clemency for FBI informant 'White Boy Rick',"TALLAHASSEE — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Clemency Board are considering early prison release for a man known as ""White Boy Rick,"" once one of the FBI's youngest informants and the subject of a recent Hollywood movie.

The board this week heard the case of Richard Wershe Jr., 49, who's imprisoned in Florida for his role in a large interstate car theft ring operated while he was already in prison. At age 14, Wershe was an FBI informant in Detroit who helped convict a major cocaine trafficking ring but eventually got caught selling drugs himself.

His story was the basis of the 2018 film ""White Boy Rick"" and starred Matthew McConaughey, with Richie Merritt in the title role.

At the hearing, two retired FBI agents told the board Wershe deserves early release because of all he did for the government, including assistance on several public corruption cases while behind bars. His current release date is Oct. 26, 2020, from the Putnam Correctional Institution in Florida.

The board did not immediately issue a decision, although its staff recommended early release.

""I believe a great injustice to Richard Wershe has been done by the government,"" said ex-agent Herman Groman, who said Wershe infiltrated a violent Detroit drug gang and helped prosecutors convict 20 people in the 1980s. ""He has never been recognized because of this.""

Added former agent Gregg Schwartz: ""He has never lied to me about anything. I fully recommend for clemency. He's contributed greatly to law enforcement.""

DeSantis, a Republican chairing his first clemency hearing since taking office, appeared to express skepticism. The governor noted that Wershe got involved in a car theft ring involving some 150 stolen vehicles while behind bars serving his drug sentence.

""He had been helping you guys and then turned around and engaged in additional criminal conduct,"" DeSantis said.

""You need to look at the totality of everything he has done over 32 years,"" Schwartz replied.

Attorney General Ashley Moody, a former judge and prosecutor, told the agents it ""speaks volumes"" that they showed up for Wershe but did not indicate if she supports early prison release.

DeSantis told reporters before the board meeting that he has an open mind on all clemency cases.

""You know, I want there to be a rough equality of justice here. Not all cases are exactly the same,"" the governor said. ""I do believe in redemption and that does play a role.""

In Detroit, Wershe became a youthful FBI informant after agents began investigating his father for illegally selling guns. After infiltrating the drug gang and assisting in numerous convictions, Wershe was arrested with a large amount of drugs himself and eventually was sentenced to life in prison in Michigan.

He was released on parole in 2017 and then moved to the Florida prison to serve his five-year racketeering sentence in the car theft ring.

Attorney Jeff Kottkamp, a former Florida lieutenant governor who represents Wershe, said he's optimistic that Wershe will win his release.

""I think it's fair to say Mr. Wershe has paid his debt to society and then some,"" Kottkamp said.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Clemency Board are considering early prison release for a man known as ""White Boy Rick,"" once one of the FBI's youngest informants and the subject of a recent Hollywood movie.

The board on Wednesday heard the case of Richard Wershe Jr., 49, who's imprisoned in Florida for his role in a large interstate car theft ring operated while he was already in prison. At age 14, Wershe was an FBI informant in Detroit who helped convict a major cocaine trafficking ring but eventually got caught selling drugs himself.

His story was the basis of the 2018 film ""White Boy Rick"" starred Matthew McConaughey, with Richie Merritt in the title role.

At the hearing, two retired FBI agents told the board Wershe deserves early release because of all he did for the government, including assistance on several public corruption cases while behind bars. His current release date is Oct. 26, 2020, from the Putnam Correctional Institution in Florida.

The board did not immediately issue a decision, although its staff recommended early release.

""I believe a great injustice to Richard Wershe has been done by the government,"" said ex-agent Herman Groman, who said Wershe infiltrated a violent Detroit drug gang and helped prosecutors convict 20 people in the 1980s. ""He has never been recognized because of this.""

Added former agent Gregg Schwartz: ""He has never lied to me about anything. I fully recommend for clemency. He's contributed greatly to law enforcement.""

DeSantis, a Republican chairing his first clemency hearing since taking office, appeared to express skepticism. The governor noted that Wershe got involved in a car theft ring involving some 150 stolen vehicles while behind bars serving his drug sentence.

""He had been helping you guys and then turned around and engaged in additional criminal conduct,"" DeSantis said.

""You need to look at the totality of everything he has done over 32 years,"" Schwartz replied.

Attorney General Ashley Moody, a former judge and prosecutor, told the agents it ""speaks volumes"" that they showed up for Wershe but did not indicate if she supports early prison release.

DeSantis told reporters before the board meeting that he has an open mind on all clemency cases.

""You know, I want there to be a rough equality of justice here. Not all cases are exactly the same,"" the governor said. ""I do believe in redemption and that does play a role.""

In Detroit, Wershe became a youthful FBI informant after agents began investigating his father for illegally selling guns. After infiltrating the drug gang and assisting in numerous convictions, Wershe was arrested with a large amount of drugs himself and eventually was sentenced to life in prison in Michigan.

He was released on parole in 2017 and then moved to the Florida prison to serve his five-year racketeering sentence in the car theft ring.

Attorney Jeff Kottkamp, a former Florida lieutenant governor who represents Wershe, said he's optimistic that Wershe will win his release.

""I think it's fair to say Mr. Wershe has paid his debt to society and then some,"" Kottkamp said. ""I believe if given a second chance, Mr. Wershe will be a model citizen.""

856,Piping hot: Cameron Carpenter ready to take Naples on a fast organ ride,"With his Mohawk head shave, his earring and his intense brown eyes, Cameron Carpenter looks like someone you might have some of those profiling fears about if you met him in a dark alley. Quick, defend yourself: Ask a question about pipe organs.

What quickly emerges is a mind like Sheldon Cooper from the ""Big Bang Theory"" with a Stephen Hawking sense of humor: Carpenter is a guy with an immense knowledge of and enthusiasm for the instrument on he's such a virtuoso. His concert begins at 8 p.m. Thursday and Friday at Artis—Naples.

But you'll want to come at 7 to catch his interview during the prelude.

More: Last chances, first ops: For BFF 'Bridesmaid,' 'Mamma Mia!', legal art and that drawing

Carpenter dives into conversations about organ music with the relish usually reserved for sports fanatics and wine enthusiasts. He obviously loves pipe organs and remembers every one he has played, including a stint on the 3,600-pipe Casavant organ in Hayes Hall when he was 11 years old.

""I remember this organ from when I was a boy, so I'm kind of familiar with it, "" he said in phone interview. ""I'll definitely forget a face. But organs I remember.""

Carpenter laughed at the notion of being an ""organ star: ""Organ star is the most relative of terms,"" he teased.

But before July he'll have performed in Moscow, Estonia, China, Austria and Switzerland. Some of the concerts will be on the local venue's pipe organ. Others, often recitals, will be on a Marshall & Ogletree digital pipe organ that he calls his ""touring organ."" It's an instrument developed by two longtime professional that creates all the tones organ pipes deliver — even, in its Opus series, with the sounds of the sounds of the blower, the organ chest, stop actions and the motors.

Carpenter is excited about its potential for organists, who can have much more of a hand in developing the mix.

""This lowers the barrier between the (musician and the builder). Ultimately the organ has to be a user’s instrument. The more an organist can be involved at the beginning, the better it will be.""

He's also philosophical about the dearth of pipe-organ orchestra works.

""There are real reasons behind the fabric of the organ, how it is and what it is. It really isn't a collaborative instrument. It's not that it can't collaborate, but its concept is to be a total musical universe,"" he explained. ""So in a way, everything that you add to it is bizarrely kind of redundant.""

Further, he added, that organs of the past were in more of a nascent stage than composers realized.

""When people we think of as the great concerto writers were writing, the organ was much less than it is today. The piano, when Brahms was writing, was pretty much the same piano you've got on stage today,"" he said. But with organs ""especially now with the new digital organs, it's a completely new universe.""

The concerto he'll play, the Poulenc Organ Concerto, was written in the early years of the pipe organ's renaissance, which carried it outside churches into concert halls, restaurants, department stores and even homes. The concerto is regularly played with a voicing specified by Maurice Duruflé, the virtuoso who premiered the work. Carpenter cheerfully says he ignores that.

""Duruflé is a great composer, but I completely do away with his registration suggestions. I don't agree with them at all,"" he said.

Anyone who has heard other renditions of the Poulenc only need a snippet of Carpenter's rendition to appreciate the difference.

French fare: Preview that Poulenc with Carpenter at minute 2:48

He doesn't want to be too hard on Duruflé: ""Who's to say what Duruflé would have done if he had the organ I have today?""

""I think the secret to the Poulenc is the use of these incredibly interesting registers. If you like, you can see it as using the organ as parts of the orchestra that are not in the instrumentation, actually, because the score uses only the strings and timpani.

""It's kind of a way to use the organ so that it makes it a complete whole. That's one problem for me with Duruflé. For my taste, he made the organ part of the piece into something that was too confrontational.""

Carpenter has carried his ardor for collaboration into transcription of orchestral works to bring in the pipe organ. Among them are the final movement of Mahler's Fifth Symphony and the Chopin ""Revolutionary"" Etude, during which he actually rips through a run on the pedals. His first orchestral disc, under the baton of Christoph Eschenbach, includes a dazzling rendition of the Rachmaninoff Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.

It's a wonderful entree into the orchestral world for Carpenter. ""It's a big audience favorite. All orchestras know it. And every conductor does it. So it's a very practical work to submit.""

Seeing Carpenter perform it — or perform the Poulenc, for that matter — onstage will take you back to the same eye-stopping presence that gave you pause in the alley. Carpenter's wardrobe, including his shoes, is no stranger to glitter, and he incorporates a rock musician's essence into the most elegant of Bach works.

""I'm a maniac onstage,"" he admitted.

857,Clermont man gets 15 years in home invasion death,"CLERMONT – A man convicted of felony murder in a home invasion robbery in Clermont caught a break Tuesday when a judge imposed a 15-year prison sentence instead of slamming shut a steel door on him for the rest of his life.

Tareak Ilarreza was found guilty of second-degree murder in January for a robbery and shootout at Raintree Apartments in Clermont because his cousin, who intended to rob the man in the apartment, was shot to death.

Ilarreza’s mother begged Circuit Judge Lawrence Semento for mercy.

“He’s a good boy,” said Milagros Peguero.

She said her then-19-year-old son had only been in Florida for three days and had just graduated from high school in St. Croix.

Ilarreza’s attorney, Alison Kerestes, asked Peguero if her son would return to the Virgin Islands, a U.S. territory, once he released from prison.

“Fast,” she said.

Kerestes said Ilarreza was even eligible for youthful offender status.

Assistant State Attorney Jonathan Olson argued for the maximum penalty: life without parole.

He conceded that the state could not prove Ilarreza’s intent was to rob that night, but someone did die, he said.

He also disputed Kerestes’ claim that Ilareza was a “minor participant.” He lied to police and tried to conceal a bloody T-shirt at the hospital, Olson said.

A jury found that Ilarreza was with his cousins and a family friend on July 30, 2017, and decided he was guilty of felony murder, but they didn’t find him guilty of attempted murder or burglary.

Luis Robles-Carmona testified that someone knocked on his door at 3 a.m. He said he looked through the peep hole, didn’t recognize the man but opened the door anyway. When he did, a bullet whizzed past his head.

Robles-Carmona, who had picked up a handgun on his way to the door, opened fire, hitting Aswad Velasquez, 22.

Someone yelled, “My brother!”

Suddenly, bullets were flying from all directions, including from downstairs, where someone opened fire with a .30-caliber carbine. One bullet was aimed at a neighbor who opened her door to see what was going on. It just missed her.

Another bullet caused a minor injury to Robles-Carmona’s wife. The couple’s children were not injured.

Ilarreza, Lawrence Alexis, and Isiah E. Velasquez, took the wounded man to Celebration Hospital, where he died.

Trial is tentatively scheduled in late May for Alexis and Isiah Velasquex.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190409/clermont-man-gets-15-years-in-home-invasion-death?rssfeed=true,2019-04-09T16:08:15Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
858,Her idea. Her movie. Marsai Martin’s ‘black girl magic’ blew away her fellow ‘Little’ producer,"CLOSE From the producers of ""Girls Trip,"" ""Little"" shows a business mogul trapped in her 13-year-old body. USA TODAY

When FAMU graduate and producer Will Packer was 14-years-old, the movie ""Big"" debuted. When Marsai Martin was the same age, she was executive producer and lead actress in a Hollywood movie inspired by that 1988 film.

""She is somebody who is very grounded, has a very strong sense of self,"" Packer told Sway's Universe SiriusXM program. ""I didn't have that at my age.""

The 14-year-old known for her role on the ABC sitcom ""Black-ish,"" recently became the youngest Hollywood executive producer ever with the release of ""Little."" When she came up with the idea as a 10-year-old and shared it with Will Packer, he said she was already acting out scenes she had developed in her head.

""She had this vision for this movie. She already knew she wanted Regina Hall to be the actress that played her as an adult,"" Packer told xoNecole.com. ""This is actual, real, black girl magic.""

The idea was for reverse the plot of the movie ""Big,"" so instead of a boy in a man's body, Martin portrays a woman in a girl's body. The role required maturity because it needed her to act and speak like a person beyond her years in scenes alongside Issa Rae and Justin Hartley. Packer, who's also a producer on the film, said he talked to her about how she wanted to pull that off while making it accessible to more than just adults.

""What she said was 'I don't want to make it soft. I don't want to make a movie that doesn't feel real to my generation,' "" Packer said. ""It has the sensibility of today's teens, and Marsai helped with that.""

Will Packer movies have grossed $800 million and counting: How he grew up and how he got here

Packer's career in film didn't start until he arrived at FAMU. He and fellow graduate Rob Hardy put out an independent movie called ""Chocolate City"" during their time at the university, to little fanfare. Since then, he's produced blockbusters like ""Stomp the Yard,"" ""Straight Outta Compton,"" ""Girls Trip.""

""Whenever you are doing something for the first time, you are always going to run into challenges that seem insurmountable. But we got past it,"" Packer said at an event celebrating the 25th anniversary of the release of ""Chocolate City"". ""That early success still drives me when I encounter challenges in my career today.""

Those same messages have no doubt been passed onto Martin, who's grateful to both Packer and fellow producer Tracy Y. Wilson.

""It feels very important to me because they did listen to my story,"" Martin said at the film's premiere in Atlanta.

Unlike many child stars who may not go onto have a successful Hollywood career in adulthood, Packer sees a very bright future for Martin.

""Some people have an innate ability, a skill set that is undeniable,"" Packer said. ""She is going to be somebody we're going to be talking about for a long time.""

""Little"" opens at Tallahassee theaters on April 12.

Two men who opened fire on a crowd of people gathered for a baby shower, wounding six people, including two children, may have acted in retaliation for an earlier gang conflict, police said Sunday.Authorities have only “shards of information” about what happened at the family gathering in Chicago because witnesses are not cooperating, a police spokesman said, but investigators hope the serious nature of the children’s injuries will prompt someone to talk.“This is a very tragic incident. You have two young children, an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, clinging to life,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.At least a dozen people were gathered outside a home decorated with balloons for the baby shower when two armed men approached on foot and began shooting about 6:30 p.m. Saturday, Guglielmi said.The gunmen fired multiple rounds and ran away down an alley, he said.An 8-year-old boy was shot in the chest and back, and a 10-year-old girl was shot in the leg. Both children were in critical but stable condition. Their names were not released.Also shot were four other people — three men ranging in age from 23 to 48 and a 29-year-old woman. The woman was hospitalized in critical condition, and the two younger men were in stable condition.The condition of the oldest man was unknown, and Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the woman who was hurt may have been the person who was pregnant.People rushed inside the house when the shooting began. Children who had been playing in the yard reportedly started piling atop one another as they tried to get through the door.“We were trying to pick the kids up, get the kids out of the way. They were going to get crushed,” Richard Nix, whose grandson was having the shower, told The Chicago Tribune. “It wasn’t nothing but kids in front of the house, sitting on the porch. They was just playing, and the shooting went off.”The shooting occurred in the West Englewood neighborhood of Chicago’s South Side, and investigators had indications it was in retaliation for a previous incident, the spokesman said.“It’s part of a larger conflict that’s going on in that area,” Guglielmi said.Another shooting occurred Sunday morning about three blocks from the home where the gunfire erupted, he said, but it was unclear whether there was any connection.Authorities have struggled to contain violence in Chicago, the nation’s third-largest city. Police said 561 homicides were committed in the city last year, a total that exceeded the number of killings in New York and Los Angeles combined.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/2-children-4-adults-shot-and-wounded-during-baby-shower-in-chicago/27070155,2019-04-08T09:06:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
860,Impact 100 grants making life-saving programs possible | Guestview,"Oct. 15, 2017 is a day I fondly remember. The Pensacola Humane Society (PHS) was chosen as an IMPACT 100 Pensacola Bay Area grant recipient, and our dream of a mobile adoption bus became a reality. Adoption is a pillar of our organization’s programs and the mobile unit would enable PHS to increase our annual adoptions by facilitating off-site events. With a yearly adoption average of about 900 -1000, we anticipated it would increase annual adoptions by at least 10%. In the first eight months The Humane Express traveled to over 70 community and adoption events and found “furever” homes for 80 cats and dogs at these events. We are very proud of the success, but most importantly the impact on these 80 animals. No more days in the shelter but finally with their forever families.

Several heart-warming stories come to mind. One of the most recent is Pilgrim. Pilgrim came to PHS as a stray dog in September 2017. He spent 372 days with us before being adopted by an amazing family at the “Fall in Love” adoption event at the fairgrounds on September 24, 2018. Had it not been for The Humane Express, we might not have been able to introduce Pilgrim to his new family.

Savina was transferred to PHS from Escambia County Animal Services last spring. We thought she would be adopted right away due to her wonderful personality and gorgeous coat; however, she had been seen and passed over both at the adoption center and at events. At a Gulf Breeze event, we were discussing Savina and how we just couldn't understand why she hadn't been adopted yet. We figured her forever family just wasn't ready for her yet, and fate would eventually bring them to her. About 15 minutes later a mother and her autistic son came to look at the dogs. They fell in love immediately with Savina, and truly, we had never seen her behave as gently and wonderfully with any other potential adopter. Sadly, when the mother called their landlord, he said no to allowing them to bring a dog home. With everyone in tears, we put Savina back on the bus and they went away devastated.

The event continued, and the volunteers had packed up and gone home. We were pulling the last door closed on the bus when we heard someone yelling ""Wait!"" It was the mother back with her son. The landlord had relented! Our volunteer coordinator, Mark Sortino, and I were able to complete the adoption and Savina had her new family. About a week later we received the most wonderful update from the adopters.

Savina had fit perfectly into their new home and had changed their lives for the better. Somehow Savina instinctively knew that the little boy's outbursts were triggered by noise, so she never made a sound when the boy was in the house, only when he was away. She would calm him down immediately if he was upset in any way. Thanks to Savina, this wonderful family is living a fuller and more “normal” life.

The Humane Express plays an important role in our community programs, which also include a spay/neuter clinic, our new thrift store, educational programs offered to civic and student organizations, volunteer opportunities, and a resource of valuable information on a wide variety of topics, including adoption.

The Barbara Grice Memorial Spay and Neuter Clinic offers a high quality, low-cost alternative and plays an important role in decreasing numbers of homeless pets. The clinic was also made possible by an IMPACT 100 grant awarded in 2014. Since opening in May 2015, it has successfully performed over 20,000 spay and neuter surgeries! We partner with Escambia County and now Santa Rosa County to make available to residents meeting specific requirements a low-cost option for vaccinations and altering to not only control the pet population but ensure their health and welfare.

We are incredibly thankful to IMPACT 100. These funds have made life-saving programs possible in our community. Pensacola Humane Society. IMPACT 100. Saving Lives 4 Paws at a time.

Nonprofit organizations that would like to be considered for an IMPACT 100 grant this year, should attend the Nonprofit Workshop held on April 16 from 9 a.m. – 12:15 p.m. at the Brownsville Community Center, 3200 W. DeSoto Street, Pensacola. Pre-registration is required and can be done online at https://impact100pensacola.org/grant-info/nonprofits-workshop.

The featured speaker at this event is Karin Cox, senior executive vice president and chief creative officer of Hartsook Companies. She will focus her talk on ""Grant Me the Money: Define, Prepare, Apply & Award,” drawing on her extensive experience in assisting nonprofit organizations in raising millions of dollars. She will share tips, techniques and best practices for effectively participating in a grant cycle from beginning to end. The workshop will also include information regarding the IMPACT 100 grant application process for 2019 with a review of all required forms and instructions for digital grant submissions. A panel discussion with board members, previous grant recipients, and a construction consultant will cap this event.

Jennifer Bitner is executive director of the Pensacola Humane Society.

864,"Toddler chokes on apple at day care, now paralyzed","A toddler went into cardiac arrest for 30 minutes, resulting in severe cerebral palsy, after choking on a piece of raw apple at his day care, news outlets in New Zealand reported this week.

The scare took place in May 2016, when Neihana Renata was 22 months old, at the Little Lights Kindy nursery in Rotorua, New Zealand.

Neihana is now paralyzed and brain-damaged. He was hospitalized for two months as he recovered from the choking incident.

Neihana was just recently featured on the news program “Sunday,” which is part of TV-NZ, a New Zealand public broadcast service.

In the aftermath of the emergency, “We basically got told we have a boy that can breathe,” said Wi Renata, Neihana’s father. “(He was) still -- no movements. He could open his eyes, but there was nothing there. He could just breathe.”

MSN reports that prior to the incident, the boy loved to run, dance and play outside. Now he can’t walk, talk or move his body. Neihana makes frequent trips to the hospital and he’s prone to chest infections. He needs constant care.

Published reports say day care teachers attempted to remove the lodged chunk of fruit from the boy’s mouth, and perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. But the cardiac arrest starved his brain of oxygen.

“Staff at the (center) did all they could to help this little boy,” said Katrina Casey, deputy secretary sector enablement and support for the Ministry of Health, according to the MSN story.

Casey said a report showed the day care followed first aid and supervision guidelines, had trained staffers on hand and called emergency services immediately.

The whole situation led to more than 120 preschools across New Zealand changing their food protocols. Evolve Education Group updated its policy in 2017, a year after the incident, reports say.

“Apple and other hard fruits and vegetables are now only served to under-3s if they are peeled and grated, cooked or mashed,” the New Zealand website Stuff reports. “This is in line with Ministry of Health guidelines.”

Science News in 2016 wrote a news story about baby-led weaning, which is when babies eat solid foods instead of spoon-fed purees, and they feed themselves.

Scientists said the practice is safe, if done right. Babies aren’t any more likely to choke eating solids, according to Science News.

865,Lawsuit says Legoland failed to accommodate boy with disability,"WINTER HAVEN — The parents of a 9-year-old boy with amputated legs have sued Legoland Florida Resort, claiming the park denied their son access to more than half of its rides during visits starting in 2016.

Josias and Sarahy Suarez, listed as Polk County residents, filed the federal lawsuit Wednesday in the District Court in Tampa, alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Florida Civil Rights Act. Their son, identified in court documents as I.S., was born without some bones in his legs and underwent amputations at the knees of both legs at age 1. He wears prosthetic limbs.

The suit says the parents visited Legoland’s customer service office upon arriving at the park on Aug. 27, 2016, and received a “Hero Pass,” given to guests who might have difficulty waiting in line. The family tried to board The Dragon roller coaster, and I.S. was placed on the ride but then removed and told he couldn’t ride because he did not have “one natural leg,” the suit alleges.

The family attempted to board another ride, and again the boy was denied access because an employee said he didn’t have “one real leg,” the suit claims.

Similar experiences occurred on subsequent visits to Legoland Florida, the suit alleges. It says an employee denied I.S. access to an area for infants and toddlers at Legoland Water Park.

The suit says I.S. was denied access to 14 of the 28 rides in the main park and four of six in Legoland Water Park. The suit says the boy met minimum height requirements for all the rides while wearing his prosthetic limbs.

The suit says the family had no problems in visits to Walt Disney World Resort and SeaWorld in Orlando. Employees at those theme parks accommodated I.S. and treated the family with respect, the suit says.

The incidents at Legoland have caused I.S. and his parents distress and lost sleep, the suit alleges. Lawyers with the Social Justice Law Collective in Dunedin filed the lawsuit.

Legoland issued the following statement:

“While we do not comment on specific cases, we are fully committed to providing an awesome experience for all of our guests, including individuals with different abilities.

“Our highest priority is the safety of our guests. The minimum safety requirements to use certain attractions, rides or water slides at our resort are based upon the guidelines and best practices set by the equipment manufacturers and industry associations. We adhere to their guidelines with the utmost attention and accuracy in order to ensure guest safety in all potential situations.”

866,"Brian Michael Rini, who claimed to be missing boy Timmothy Pitzen, charged with making false statements","CINCINNATI — The Ohio man who claimed to be Timmothy Pitzen, an Illinois boy who went missing in 2011 at age 6, has been charged with making false statements to a federal agent, according to the FBI.

According to the FBI, Brian Michael Rini, 23, told investigators he heard about Timmothy on TV's ""20/20,"" and said he wished he had a father like Timmothy's.

Rini is accused of telling the FBI he was being held captive in a hotel room and forced to have sex with men, according to a criminal complaint.

The complaint states, Rini refused to provide fingerprints, but ultimately agreed to DNA testing at Children's Hospital.

U.S. Attorney Ben Glassman said law enforcement responded to the situation ""exactly as you would hope they would,"" contacting other federal and local law enforcement.

A Cincinnati police officer working with the FBI task force spoke to Rini who insisted he was Timmothy Pitzen until confronted with DNA evidence.

Glassman said Rini had twice before claimed to be a victim of child sex trafficking. In those cases, his fingerprints were used to debunk him, Glassman explained.

Glassman said the search for Timmothy is still ongoing.

""My heart goes out to the family of Timmothy Pitzen,"" Glassman said. ""I can only imagine the pain they've been through.""

Rini had twice before made similar claims that he was someone else.

Rini was booked into the Hamilton County Jail around 11 p.m., according to the Hamilton County Jail website.

On Wednesday, Rini told police he was Timmothy, who has been missing from Illinois for nearly eight years. DNA tests showed that he was not the boy.

Rini's name came up in a DNA database, officials said.

Newport Police Chief Tom Collins told The Cincinnati Enquirer that he doesn't know why Rini made up the story.

He has an adult criminal record dating back to 2013.

Authorities say a local investigation continues into the person's true identity.

The boy, who is around 14 years old, was found on the west side of Newport, Kentucky, on Wednesday afternoon.



He told authorities a story that prompted the involvement of federal investigators and local police departments in three states -- Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois.

According to a police report from the Sharonville Police Department, the boy -- who identified himself as Pitzen -- told investigators that he had just escaped two men who held him hostage for years.

That information was given to Sharonville police via Campbell County dispatchers in Kentucky.

The boy told investigators that he and his two abductors were staying at a Red Roof Inn, but could not provide the exact location of the hotel, the report stated.

The boy said he was able to escape his captors, the report stated, and flee into the Kentucky area.

869,Police say Ohio teen is not boy kidnapped 7 years ago,"CINCINNATI - Authorities say an Ohio teen who identified himself as missing Illinois boy Timmothy Pitzen is not the child who was kidnapped 7 years ago.

DNA results indicated the person in question was not Pitzen and an investigation continues to find his true identity.

The 14-year-old boy told authorities in Campbell County, Kentucky, that he fled a Red Roof Inn where he and the two men who held him for seven years were staying, according to a Sharonville, Ohio, police report obtained by WCPO.

He was unsure of the hotel's location, police said, but it appears the boy ""kept running until he ran across a bridge into"" Kentucky.

Police in Sharonville checked all Red Roof Inn hotels in the area and did not find anything, the report said. Sharonville is about 12 miles northeast of Cincinnati.

FBI field offices in Louisville and Cincinnati investigated the missing child case with law enforcement agencies in Aurora, Illinois, Cincinnati and Hamilton County, Ohio, as well as in Newport, Kentucky.

Timmothy, then a 6-year-old, went missing in May 2011 after his mother took him out of his Aurora, Illinois, school citing a family emergency and they went on a three-day road trip with stops at zoos and water parks.

The boy was last seen at a water park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

Police said the teen described his kidnappers as two white men of ""bodybuilder type build, one with a spiderweb tattoo on his neck and the other with a snake tattoo on his arms,"" the report said.

The men drove a Ford SUV with Wisconsin plates, police said.

What happened to Timmothy Pitzen?

Timmothy and his mother traveled more than 500 miles over two days. Mother and son seem relaxed and cheerful in the security video footage that investigators recovered from their stops.

During the trip, Timmothy's mother, Amy Fry-Pitzen, made several brief calls to family members, including one to her mother. She assured her that she and Timmothy were safe.

The boy also spoke to a family member, and didn't seem to be in any distress.

Timmothy's mother was found dead later in a Rockford, Illinois motel. She had killed herself.

A note was found saying that her son, Timmothy, was safe with people who would love and care for him.

""You'll never find him,"" the note read.

Timmothy's family, including his father, has continued searching for him.

""I know in my heart that he's absolutely alive, a hundred percent,"" his aunt, Kara Jacobs, said in an interview last year for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. ""I know he's out there, we just have to find him.""

870,"Man faces charges after son, 6, grazed by bullet in Miami","Trayon Fussell-Dumas, 22, faces charges after his son, 6, was shot by the boy's cousin in Miami, police say.

MIAMI - A man was arrested Tuesday, a day after his son's mother was arrested in connection with a shooting that left the 6-year-old boy injured.

Trayon Fussell-Dumas, 22, faces charges of child neglect with great bodily harm and child abuse.

The boy's mother, Laqayette Dock, 21, faces the same charges.

According to an arrest report, Fussell-Dumas left his son at a relative's home on March 31.

Police said he told detectives he arrived back at the home a few hours later and saw several family members panicking.

Fussell-Dumas asked them what happened and was told his son and the boy's cousin were playing and his son was shot by the boy's cousin, the arrest report stated.

Police said the victim's cousin is 8 years old.

According to authorities, the victim's neck was grazed by a bullet and Fussell-Dumas admitted that the injury was serious enough to require treatment, but he was scared to take the boy to a hospital.

Police said the boy's father dropped him off at Dock's home the same day and assumed she would take their son to the hospital.

Authorities said Dock did not believe the wound was severe enough to take the boy to the hospital and she instead decided to self-treat it.

Police were notified about the shooting after the boy went to school and told his classmates that he had been shot over spring break.

The Florida Department of Children and Families has opened an investigation into the incident and the boy has been placed in the temporary custody of his maternal great aunt.

873,Florida mulls clemency for FBI informant 'White Boy Rick',"Richard Wershe Jr.'s story was the basis of the 2018 film ""White Boy Rick"" starred Matthew McConaughey, with Richie Merritt in the title role.

TALLAHASSEE — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Clemency Board are considering early prison release for a man known as ""White Boy Rick,"" once one of the FBI's youngest informants and the subject of a recent Hollywood movie.

The board on Wednesday heard the case of Richard Wershe Jr., 49, who's imprisoned in Florida for his role in a large interstate car theft ring operated while he was already in prison. At age 14, Wershe was an FBI informant in Detroit who helped convict a major cocaine trafficking ring but eventually got caught selling drugs himself.

His story was the basis of the 2018 film ""White Boy Rick"" starred Matthew McConaughey, with Richie Merritt in the title role.

At the hearing, two retired FBI agents told the board Wershe deserves early release because of all he did for the government, including assistance on several public corruption cases while behind bars. His current release date is Oct. 26, 2020, from the Putnam Correctional Institution in Florida.

The board did not immediately issue a decision, although its staff recommended early release.

""I believe a great injustice to Richard Wershe has been done by the government,"" said ex-agent Herman Groman, who said Wershe infiltrated a violent Detroit drug gang and helped prosecutors convict 20 people in the 1980s. ""He has never been recognized because of this.""

Added former agent Gregg Schwartz: ""He has never lied to me about anything. I fully recommend for clemency. He's contributed greatly to law enforcement.""

DeSantis, a Republican chairing his first clemency hearing since taking office, appeared to express skepticism. The governor noted that Wershe got involved in a car theft ring involving some 150 stolen vehicles while behind bars serving his drug sentence.

""He had been helping you guys and then turned around and engaged in additional criminal conduct,"" DeSantis said.

""You need to look at the totality of everything he has done over 32 years,"" Schwartz replied.

Attorney General Ashley Moody, a former judge and prosecutor, told the agents it ""speaks volumes"" that they showed up for Wershe but did not indicate if she supports early prison release.

DeSantis told reporters before the board meeting that he has an open mind on all clemency cases.

""You know, I want there to be a rough equality of justice here. Not all cases are exactly the same,"" the governor said. ""I do believe in redemption and that does play a role.""

In Detroit, Wershe became a youthful FBI informant after agents began investigating his father for illegally selling guns. After infiltrating the drug gang and assisting in numerous convictions, Wershe was arrested with a large amount of drugs himself and eventually was sentenced to life in prison in Michigan.

He was released on parole in 2017 and then moved to the Florida prison to serve his five-year racketeering sentence in the car theft ring.

Attorney Jeff Kottkamp, a former Florida lieutenant governor who represents Wershe, said he's optimistic that Wershe will win his release.

""I think it's fair to say Mr. Wershe has paid his debt to society and then some,"" Kottkamp said. ""I believe if given a second chance, Mr. Wershe will be a model citizen.""",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190313/florida-mulls-clemency-for-fbi-informant-white-boy-rick?rssfeed=true,2019-03-13T09:55:43Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471
876,Woman charged for taking garden shears to dentist's sexy Easter mannequins display,"CLIFTON — The woman who used garden shears to destroy a sexy mannequin Easter display in front of a dentist's office has been charged with criminal mischief.

Desiree Shepstone, 37, of Clifton damaged the mannequins and decorations as she used garden shears to take down the display from the front yard of Grove Street dentist Wayne Gangi's office and residence on Tuesday, according to a police summons that has been mailed to her home.

Shepstone approached the display of five mannequins that were dressed in sexy black and pink lingerie and holding Easter baskets on Tuesday afternoon as a New York City news crew was filming for a later broadcast.

She returned with the shears and, in front of the crew, cut the bindings that held the mannequins to stands and dismantled the display, according to the WPIX News recording.

Shepstone then left the area. On Wednesday, police said they had mailed the summons to her home, across the street from the dentist's office.

Gangi first drew media attention Monday when the community reacted to the mannequins dressed as Playboy Bunnies, some wearing fishnet stockings, on a lawn festooned with Easter eggs.

Gangi, who was not in the office during the destruction of the display, returned and was captured on video by the same news crew as he learned of his mannequins' fate.

Local opinion on the display varied from offensive to funny to ""gross,"" but after the destruction, most said the dentist has a right to express himself on his own property.

Shepstone, who was not available for comment, spoke with WOR radio on Wednesday morning and said she removed the display because she didn't want her 16-year-old son to be subjected to it.

""Nobody was going to do anything about it, so I did,"" Shepstone told the radio show.

Gangi said he wasn't buying her story.

""There was a lot of drama going on, and she wanted to be a part of it,"" he said.

Shepstone's actions may have backfired, as she will now have to appear in Municipal Court — and support for Gangi and his display have grown.

""Nobody deserves this,"" said Clifton's Gina Scaduto-Zhitnik, who previously posted that she found the display abhorrent. ""Nobody has the right to enter somebody's property and touch, destroy or damage anything.""

Police conducted an investigation that included interviews with multiple eyewitnesses and a review of multiple sources of video evidence, said Clifton Sgt. Robert Anderson.

Gangi said he wanted her to have to appear in court.

""I made sure of that,"" he said, adding that based on police advice he posted ""no trespassing"" and ""private property"" signs where the display once stood.

He said he was told that if she or anyone else trespasses, it will be a more serious infraction.

""I'll go to court. I won't say anything, but watch the videos,"" Gangi said.

Gangi's office, at the corner of Robin Hood Road, is no stranger to holiday decoration controversy. In the past, his elaborate Halloween and Christmas decorations have drawn criticism as well as lots of visitors and praise.

In 2012, the dentist's display of bloody corpses, skeletons and furry spiders that covered his building and property at 562 Grove St. attracted lots of visitors as well as a parking-ticket blitz, because Clifton police cracked down on what they called traffic hazards. Gangi was not happy and threatened to put an end to the decorations. He has not done so.

The lifelong Clifton resident said the displays, which he admits often push the envelope, are his way of giving back to the community.

""It's fun when things are going your way. It's fun to make people laugh,"" he said. ""It's not fun when it starts going bad.""

More: Judge won't tell Indian River County law enforcement agencies not to release sex tapes

He said he has received ""nasty"" notes and letters about the latest display. He has also received calls and notes of support and callers who want to help him set up the display again.

""I've had callers, all of them women, saying they are willing to help set it back up,"" Gangi said.

Others offered to replace any mannequins that were damaged.

879,"After loss of limbs and unborn son, woman holds on to hope for family home in Ave Maria","CLOSE In March of 2017, Kayleigh Ferguson-Walker contracted sepsis, which caused her to lose her unborn child and all four of her limbs. She still struggles with grief and daily frustrations, but she tries to stay positive, and has continued to make progress with the help of her family and her faith. Alex Driehaus, Naples Daily News

Kayleigh Ferguson-Walker races her daughter down the driveway of their home and onto the cul-de-sac of their Coral Springs neighborhood — the little girl on a bike with training wheels, her mom in a motorized wheelchair.

Aaliyah shrieks and giggles when she beats her mom to the end of the driveway. But if Mom wins, it’s because she cheated.

“Again,” Aaliyah tells her mother about a dozen times. She wants to go again.

It’s warm out and Ferguson-Walker is ready to go back inside. Meanwhile, her 4-year-old zooms around like a Looney Tunes character.

Ferguson-Walker wants her daughter to have as normal a life as possible. She strives to be a dedicated mother despite some limitations.

When Ferguson-Walker had her arms and legs, she could run after her daughter and hold her. She would dance with Aaliyah when she came home from work every day. She could braid her girl’s hair. They could bake together and play at the park.

“Those things I do long for,” Ferguson-Walker, 32, said. “She remembers to this day, I promised her when I get my legs I’d dance with her.”

All the Moms: Girl, 4, hospitalized with life-threatening sepsis after trying on shoes without socks

Ferguson-Walker was a healthy, young mom and wife until the day her health spiraled.

She worked as a pharmacy technician. She and her husband, Ramon Ferguson-Walker, were expecting their second child — a boy they’d already named. She was six months pregnant.

The couple’s dream to buy a home was close to becoming a reality. They looked forward to raising their growing family in a two-story home in Ave Maria and be close to some of Ramon’s family.

Then things fell apart.

In March 2017, a deadly illness claimed Ferguson-Walker’s limbs and the life of her unborn child, but it didn’t take away her will to fight.

Like a bad flu



It felt like a bad flu.

The night she got sick, Ferguson-Walker thought she could sleep off the temperature spikes and chills, but her symptoms grew worse.

She asked her husband for water and juice, but she couldn’t keep the fluids down. Her heart raced.

Ramon packed his wife and daughter in their car and rushed them to the Broward Health Coral Springs emergency room. As doctors and nurses examined Ferguson-Walker and took her to the labor and delivery unit, her condition went into a steep decline.

She felt dizzy and had trouble breathing. Her vision was blurred. Her heart rate spiked and her blood pressure tanked. She couldn’t provide a urine sample; her kidneys were failing.

“Everything was failing,” Ramon Ferguson-Walker, 36, said.

Doctors induced labor. The couple’s baby boy didn’t survive.

Her heart continued to race. Her breathing was labored. Doctors sedated her and, ultimately, induced a coma to treat her.

Ferguson-Walker was in a coma for two weeks, her family gathered around a hospital bed praying for her recovery, hoping she would live.

In March of 2017, Kayleigh contracted sepsis, which caused her to lose her unborn child and all four of her limbs. Since then, she has been learning to complete tasks that have allowed her to slowly regain a level of independence, as well as learning how to fill her role as a mother in a different capacity.

At the hospital

When Ferguson-Walker emerged from her coma, she said she knew something was still wrong.

Her hands were puffy and black. Her extremities were necrotic, she said — the tissues died from lack of blood flow.

“I was a big water balloon,” Ferguson-Walker said.

Ramon Ferguson-Walker said his wife’s diagnosis came down to sepsis possibly caused by a complication in her pregnancy called incompetent cervix, a condition in which the pressure of a growing baby can cause the mother’s cervix to open prematurely, causing preterm labor or miscarriage. The condition can increase the risk of infection.

Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition in which the body becomes overwhelmed by an infection and essentially turns on itself, blocking blood flow to parts of the body and possibly causing extensive tissue damage and organ failure, if not death.

2017: 'Rory's Regs' on sepsis require hospital checklists, save lives

A lawsuit the couple filed in Broward County Circuit Court cited the diagnosis. The Ferguson-Walkers filed the suit in October 2018, seeking more than $15,000 in damages and alleging Kayleigh’s doctors were negligent in her prenatal care.

According to the suit, Kayleigh saw one of her doctors about a month before she got sick and was placed on antibiotics for symptoms related to incompetent cervix. One of her doctors discontinued the antibiotics a few days later, and that day she was admitted to Broward Health Coral Springs for monitoring and steroid injections. She was discharged the next day, according to the suit.

Two weeks later, Kayleigh landed in the hospital again with the life-threatening infection.

Kayleigh’s doctors filed defenses, denying negligence and contending the couple's own negligence contributed to her illness, according to court records.

Sepsis causes the body’s blood-clotting mechanism to go into overdrive, causing blockages in the blood vessels and keeping oxygen and nutrients from reaching tissues and organs.

Her organs were spared from blood flow-related damage. Her limbs weren’t. When Ferguson-Walker emerged from the coma, she was transferred to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale for surgery. Doctors told her they would need to amputate her limbs.

Her family sprang up with questions: Were there no other options? What alternative treatments could be considered? Couldn’t some of her limbs be saved? How much time did they have to decide?

“We didn’t have the luxury of time to think about options,” said Dr. Robert Fletcher, Ferguson-Walker's surgeon. (Fletcher is not among the doctors the lawsuit accuses of negligence.)

Ferguson-Walker, still under the haze of medications and unable to ask many questions herself, didn’t take long to make her decision.

She told doctors to do whatever they needed to do to save her life.

Grateful

Ferguson-Walker said she is grateful to be alive. So is her family. But their gratitude still comes with pain.

Ferguson-Walker’s mother, Laurel Robinson, still gets emotional when she talks about what her daughter has gone through. She said it was hard to see her daughter lose her independence and struggle with everyday tasks people sometimes take for granted.

Robinson sometimes helps her daughter bathe. She put a shirt on Kayleigh one day after a bath and told her to put her arm through the sleeve.

“I was waiting for her arm to come through and realized it wouldn’t,” Robinson said.

Ferguson-Walker’s legs were amputated below the knee. Her left arm was amputated below the elbow; her right arm above the elbow.

“I do have faith but also question God,” Robinson said. “Why all four limbs? Why not just one? But I’m also glad she’s here in her daughter’s life and her husband’s. I know she’ll get better. She won’t be at this stage forever, but you still wonder when and why.”

Their gratitude also comes with frustration.

Ferguson-Walker wants to take care of herself independently again. To drive, bathe herself, go to work, take walks, swim. To not have to rely on anyone but herself to get to where she needs to be.

She gets discouraged sometimes, Ferguson-Walker said, because of everything she wishes she could do. But she works every day toward achieving goals and views her challenges as a journey.

“I’ve been thinking positively,” Ferguson-Walker said. “Thinking I have to go on in life and do things creatively. Take things one day at a time.”

In the two years since she fell ill, Ferguson-Walker has mastered feeding herself, putting on her makeup, combing her hair and getting herself around her parents’ home with the help of an electric wheelchair and a left-arm prosthetic with a hook attached. She can transfer herself from her regular wheelchair to the sofa in her parents’ living room.

She started seeing a therapist in the past few months and said talking to someone helps. For a while, she attended a support group for amputees at a Hanger Clinic in Broward, where she is being examined for prosthetics. Some of her wounds are still healing.

She said she would like to create her own support group of people closer to her age who survived sepsis or lost limbs. She is thinking of making motivational videos and doing speaking engagements somewhere down the line.

Her husband is there to challenge her, encourage her to take on new things and cheer on her progress.

He sometimes sends his wife YouTube videos of amputees talking about their journeys and showing what they have accomplished since the incidents that claimed their limbs. The videos, he hopes, will show her everything she can do and inspire her when she feels low. He looks for ways to make her life easier and tells her he believes in her.

“He pushes me,” Ferguson-Walker said.

She started to take up writing and drawing. She can fill out doctor’s forms with her prosthetic and draws pictures at home with Aaliyah.

In the past few months, she started transferring herself from her bed to her wheelchair and vice versa. It requires some twisting, wiggling and praying she won’t hit the ground, but she gets it done.

“Being able to do that felt good,” Ferguson-Walker said. “Once I got over the fear, the task became so much easier.”

Every accomplishment, every small step toward independence, is a victory.

“From 2017 to now, I see it as a new lifestyle,” Ferguson-Walker said. “I didn’t want to take it on as something impossible to live with, to live through. The triumph is still being here. Having a family, being a wife and mom.”

A home of their own

The couple and their daughter moved in with Kayleigh's parents when she was discharged from the hospital and rehabilitation programs. Kayleigh’s mom helped with her daughter’s personal care while Ramon was at work. Kayleigh’s dad, Charles Robinson, helps with Aaliyah’s care and drives her to and from school.

The couple’s dreams for the future, while postponed, also keep them afloat.

Two months before Ferguson-Walker got sick, the couple started the process of buying a home. They were almost ready to close on a house in Ave Maria.

“This puts a pause right in the middle of your dreams,” Ramon said. “We were looking forward to having another child, and this happened. We felt like we made it; we’re there, buying a home.”

Months after his wife’s illness, he said they had to decide whether they should go through with the purchase.

They did. Ramon said it was an opportunity they didn’t want to pass up. The house was a symbol of the hope they had before his wife’s illness, he said, but it wasn’t a good fit. It’s two stories tall, and while Kayleigh hopes to one day have prosthetics on her legs, she can’t climb stairs. The couple may sell or rent the house once they have a place they can move into.

The Ave Maria house serves as an escape for Ramon and Kayleigh when they need a break from the doctor’s appointments, insurance calls and general responsibilities. They try to drive from Coral Springs to Ave Maria every few weekends and visit some of Ramon’s family, watch movies and go out for ice cream. Their drives also allow them to see the progress of their home being built.

Aaliyah will have a room on the second floor. Ramon and Kayleigh will sleep on air mattresses or on a couch in the living room.

“Every time we come here, we’re holding on (to the hope),” Ramon said.

The home isn’t wheelchair-accessible, so the space Kayleigh can use is limited. They bought an Amazon Alexa device that gives Kayleigh some voice control over things such as the television, lights and thermostat.

Friends of the family are raising money to build a more accessible home not far from the one the couple bought.

After Kayleigh fell ill, a GoFundMe account was created to help the family with medical bills and expenses. The fundraising for the more accessible home is being done through a website called Fundly.

The couple said CC Homes, the builder of the home the Ferguson-Walkers bought, agreed to build them a more accessible one-story home and donate the labor. The house will have ramps, widened doorways and some basic smart technology.

Looking ahead

Despite the setbacks, low moments and frustrations, the couples’ faith in God, their family and each other keep them moving forward.

(Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Aaliyah saw her mom at the hospital when Kayleigh was being treated in 2017. The girl, then 2 years old, realized something was different and didn’t want to get too close to her mom at first. She became more comfortable once Kayleigh was moved to the rehab center and started asking questions.

Kayleigh told her, “Mommy’s legs and arms had to go, but I’ll get something to help me.”

It took her some time, but Aaliyah would get close and give her mom kisses. She’d grab a spoon and feed Kayleigh, then herself. She’d put on gloves and apply her mom’s lotion.

Aaliyah became her mom’s little helper and still is. She brushes Kayleigh’s hair, helps with her makeup and sometimes feeds her snacks.

The Ferguson-Walkers wanted their girl to have a little brother. Aaliyah probably would have been as caring for him as she is for her mom.

Kayleigh has her moments, but she said she has made peace with the loss of her baby. Talking to her husband and therapist helped her process the grief.

“The only way to move forward is to confront these things I’m uncomfortable with,” she said.

Robinson, Kayleigh’s mom, said it was difficult for her daughter to be around pregnant women at first. Kayleigh said she has become more comfortable being around babies, but she sometimes feels off balance when she is around baby boys.

“For the little one we lost, we’ll see him again,” Ramon said. “We work harder now because of how things have changed.”

For Kayleigh, the hard work of recovery will culminate in being able to dance with her daughter again.

880,Sawgrass Bay students hear account of Holocaust,"TAVARES – Sawgrass Bay Elementary fifth-grade students on Friday heard the personal account of what a local woman’s family experienced during World War II and, specifically, the Holocaust.

Leslie Maxson, a fifth-grade teacher and team leader at Sawgrass, hoped the presentation would prepare students for their study of the Alan Gratz novel Prisoner B-3087, about a Jewish boy in the 1930s who is captured by the Nazis. They will start reading the book Monday.

“The book is based on a true story, and the age of the main character is the current age of our students,’’ she said. She and the other English Language Arts teachers on the team arranged the presentation, which will be shared at 9:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., as part of the lesson.

“Students will learn about history though this book and how determination and hope are important in our lives,” she said.

But first, they heard from doctor of education Sheryl Needle Cohn, an author and playwright who works as a teaching assistant at the school. Cohn is the author of The Boy in the Suitcase, a compilation of nine family stories of victims and survivors of the Holocaust, which she wrote after discovering more about her family history.

“I did not think that I would be a published author one day,” she said. “But upon discovering who the people were in a photograph in a box in the bottom of my grandmother’s closet in Brooklyn, NY, I began my own emotional genealogical journey.”

The journey took Cohn to her ancestral homeland of Dubno, a small village in the former Russian-Polish-Eastern European territories. There, she located the ditch where her relatives had been shot by roving Nazi troops.

She returned to America and began telling their story. In return, other families shared theirs. Many of those stories, including the harrowing tale of German parents who escaped to the Dominican Republic by hiding their newborn son in a suitcase, are now in her book.

Cohn, who in 2008 was selected to study at the International School for Holocaust Studies in Jerusalem, said she wanted to help students expand their knowledge of this part of history, a subject the state of Florida requires be taught in Social Studies.

She recognizes that it can be difficult emotionally for some children to process the material. So, she said, she planned to mediate the Holocaust photographs and vocabulary with dialogue that explains, teaches and stimulates thinking.

“They should take away an understanding of how cruel prejudice, discrimination, hatred, lies, ignorance and bullying can be,” she said. “In spite of hardships faced by Jews during the Holocaust, I end each section with the inspirational message, ‘We are still here.’ Due to the bravery of our relatives, we the children, second and third generations, survived and are here to tell the stories. Respect for diversity and respecting the rights of all citizens, regardless of race and religion should be the culminating message.”",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190406/sawgrass-bay-students-hear-account-of-holocaust?rssfeed=true,2019-04-06T19:31:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
881,Teen arrested facing charges in deadly Palm Springs crash last October,"A 17-year-old boy was arrested Friday for his alleged role in a deadly multi-vehicle crash last year, the Florida Highway Patrol said.

Alexis Julian Vecino Nicosia is facing a vehicular homicide charge in a fatal crash that took place Oct. 21, 2018, according to the FHP. The crash happened on South Congress Avenue at the entrance of the Greenwood Shopping Center.

Nicosia was driving north on Congress from the Walgreen's on the corner of Congress and 10th Avenue North when he accelerated while changing from the center lane to the left lane to pass a slower moving vehicle, the FHP said. Nicosia then lost control of his car, went across the roadway and into the Greenwood Shopping Center.

Nicosia's car hit the left side of 23-year-old Nicholas Woodward, who was stopped at the stop sign waiting to make a right turn onto Congress, according to the FHP. Nicosia's car then struck a utility pole in the front passenger door area. After getting hit, Woodward's vehicle rotated and hit a small palm tree before striking a third vehicle, which was parked and unoccupied.

Woodward died at the scene.

Troopers say Nicosia was driving at 75 mph in a 40 mph zone.

882,Family of 3 seriously injured in fiery Pine Hills crash,"The Orange County Fire Rescue said investigators are on scene at a crash in the area of North Pine Hills Road and North Lane in Pine Hills.

ORLANDO, Fla. - Three family members were seriously injured Friday night in a crash in the Orlando neighborhood of Pine Hills and the driver of the other vehicle involved left the scene, according to troopers with the Florida Highway Patrol.

Troopers said the driver of a Honda Civic was at a stop sign at Fir Drive and Pine Hills Road around 10 p.m. when he failed to remain stopped and turned into the path of a Nissan Maxima.

The Nissan hit the rear door of the Honda, causing the Honda to strike the north side curb of Pine Hills road and catch fire, according to the crash report.

Troopers said the driver of the Nissan fled on foot. Their identity is unknown, according to the report.

The 43-year-old driver of the Honda was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center in serious condition. His two passengers, a 9-year-old girl and 7-year-old boy were taken to Arnold Palmer Hospital also in serious condition. All three victims share the same last name, according to the crash report.

Troopers said the crash remains under investigation and charges are pending.

A section of North Pine Hills Road and North Lane were closed Friday night into Saturday, according to Orange County Fire Rescue.

CINCINNATI (AP) — A man who authorities say claimed to be an Illinois boy who disappeared eight years ago has twice made similar claims in which he falsely portrayed himself as a juvenile sex trafficking victim, according to an FBI affidavit filed in federal court Friday.

Brian Rini of Medina, Ohio, was jailed in Cincinnati on Thursday. The FBI has identified Rini as the person who claimed to be Timmothy Pitzen, who disappeared in 2011 at age 6.

The FBI declared the man’s story a hoax Thursday based on DNA testing one day after he identified himself to authorities as Pitzen.

Enough evidence exists to charge Rini with lying to federal authorities, the affidavit said. The U.S. attorney’s office in Cincinnati scheduled a Friday news conference on the case. No attorney was listed for Rini in court documents Friday.

Rini was found Wednesday in Newport, Kentucky, “wandering the street and looking confused and in need of assistance,” according to the six-page affidavit from FBI agent Mary Braun.

After identifying himself as Pitzen, Rini complained of abdominal pain and was taken to the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Emergency Room, the affidavit said. Rini refused to be fingerprinted Wednesday and Thursday but agreed to a DNA test which on Thursday identified him as Rini, according to Braun.

Even after Rini was advised of his rights and warned against making false statements, he continued to insist he was Pitzen and that he had escaped from a hotel where he’d been forced to have sex with men against his will, the affidavit said.

Rini finally acknowledged his identity after being confronted with the DNA results, said he had watched a story about Pitzen on ABC’s 20/20 news program, and had wanted to get away from his family, according to Braun.

An FBI investigation found that Rini had twice portrayed himself as a juvenile sex trafficking victim, and in each case was later identified after being fingerprinted, the affidavit said.

Rini was released from prison on probation less than a month ago after serving more than a year for burglary and vandalism.

Timmothy’s family had been cautiously hopeful over Wednesday’s news, as were neighbors and others who’d long wondered whether he is dead or alive.

“Law enforcement has not and will not forget Timmothy, and we hope to one day reunite him with his family. Unfortunately, that day will not be today,” FBI spokesman Timothy Beam said in a statement Thursday.

Timmothy vanished after his mother, Amy Fry-Pitzen, pulled him out of kindergarten early one day, took him on a two-day road trip to the zoo and a water park, and then killed herself at a hotel. She left a note saying that her son was safe with people who would love and care for him, and added: “You will never find him.”

In Timmothy’s hometown of Aurora, Illinois, police Sgt. Bill Rowley said that over the years his department has received thousands of tips about Timmothy, including false sightings.

“We’re always worried about copycats, especially something that has a big national attention like this,” Rowley said.

Timmothy’s family members said they were heartbroken at the latest twist.

“It’s devastating. It’s like reliving that day all over again, and Timmothy’s father is devastated once again,” said his aunt Kara Jacobs.

The boy’s grandmother Alana Anderson said: “It’s been awful. We’ve been on tenterhooks, hopeful and frightened. It’s just been exhausting.” She added, “I feel so sorry for the young man who’s obviously had a horrible time and felt the need to say he was somebody else.”",https://www.wfla.com/national/fbi-man-who-claimed-to-be-missing-boy-has-twice-made-similar-claims/1902450999,2019-04-05T16:02:56Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) - A West Virginia man says his middle school teacher sexually abused him for years, gave birth to his children and threatened to take them away if he left her.

The Intelligencer reports 28-year-old Christopher Birch is suing former Bridge Street Middle School science teacher and track coach, Elizabeth Harbert, in an effort to end their relationship but keep contact with his children.



The lawsuit filed Thursday says Harbert began grooming Birch when he was 13 by caring for him and allowing him to move in with her and her husband. It says Harbert later divorced her husband and became pregnant with Birch's first child.



The lawsuit says the school's principal and other area leaders knew of his abuse and did nothing. Harbert and other defendants declined or didn't return requests for comment.

889,Police: Man who claimed to be boy missing since 2011 is a 'known schemer’,"Advertisement Police: Man who claimed to be boy missing since 2011 is a 'known schemer’ Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Eight years after an Illinois boy disappeared, his family began to think that their nightmare might be over at last.A young man found wandering the streets of a Kentucky town claimed he had just escaped from two men in the Cincinnati area who held him captive for seven years. And he told police his name was Timmothy Pitzen. It didn’t seem possible that someone so far away could make up such a story. So for a day and a half, relatives waited and hoped for a breakthrough.Then on Thursday came devastating word from the FBI: DNA tests showed that the person was not Timmothy, a boy from Aurora who vanished at age 6 in 2011, around the time of his mother’s suicide.“It’s like reliving that day all over again, and Timmothy’s father is devastated once again, as are we,” said the boy’s aunt Kara Jacobs, her voice choked with emotion. Authorities said the person claiming to be 14-year-old Timmothy was actually Brian Michael Rini, 23, from Medina, Ohio. He is an ex-convict who was recently released from an Ohio prison after serving time for burglary and vandalism.Rini was released from the Belmont Correctional Institute just a month prior, serving time for burglary and vandalism.He has been in and out of jail in years prior on a wide range of charges, ranging from passing bad checks and making false alarms to theft and falsification.Police in the Medina area said Rini is a ""known schemer"" and has been on law enforcement's radar for years. But his motivation in his latest hoax remains unclear. Police in Brunswick Hills Township say in 2017, Rini convinced a realtor to show him an expensive home, then managed to let himself back in that night – throwing a large party and trashing the place. He was charged in that crime and served prison time for burglary and vandalism. He was released one month ago.The man's estranged brother, Jonathon Rini, said he's not surprised by his brother's behavior.""I haven't talked to him in four years,"" Jonathon Rini said, adding that neither he nor his mother has had contact with Brian Rini. ""I'm not surprised. I mean, he's nuts,"" he said.Jonathon Rini said his brother has been in and out of jail from an early age, adding that Brian Rini has several mental health problems.""He has Asperger's, bipolar disorder, ADHD, the list goes on. He was receiving treatment but then he stopped and started getting in more trouble,"" he said. ""He's been doing stupid stuff, not this serious, but he's been doing stupid stuff for as long as I can remember,"" It's disappointing news for investigators in Aurora, Illinois, who continue to search for answers in a case that has deeply impacted the community.""Although we are disappointed that this turned out to be a hoax, we remain diligent in our search for Timmothy, as our missing persons case remains unsolved,"" officials with the Aurora Police Department said. Timmothy Pitzen's grandmother, Alana Anderson, didn't try to hide her disappointment during a brief news conference outside her home.Anderson said her prayer has always been that when Timmothy was old enough, “he would find us if we couldn’t find him.” She held out hope that if he’s “in a place where he has communication with the media or a computer, that he’ll remember us enough to look for us, and I think he will. He’s a very smart guy.”The possibility of Timmothy being found thrust his bizarre disappearance into the spotlight Thursday. Amy Fry-Pitzen took her 6-year-old son out of his kindergarten class on May 11, 2011, saying something about a family emergency.Wearing his backpack, Timmothy waved to his classmates, saying “See you tomorrow,” teacher Cheryl Broach recalled.The two climbed into Fry-Pitzen’s SUV and went on an adventure that included a visit to the Brookfield Zoo outside Chicago, a suburban Chicago resort and another resort in the Wisconsin Dells, a region that calls itself the “Waterpark Capital of the World.”The next day, according to video footage released later by police, the boy and his mother were seen leaving the Kalahari Resorts in the Dells. That was the last time the two were seen together. When Fry-Pitzen checked into a motel in Rockford, Illinois, about 120 miles away, on May 13, she was alone, according to police. The next afternoon, her body turned up but with no sign of her son. A note she left said the boy was being cared for by someone who loved him in a place where he would never be found.In the first days of the search, police said they found a significant amount of blood in the SUV’s back seat, and tests confirmed it was the boy’s. That news initially terrified Anderson, but the boy’s father explained that his son had a history of nosebleeds and had suffered a serious one just days before he disappeared.Police tried to piece together the route Fry-Pitzen might have taken in her SUV, but in the years that followed, authorities never offered a public explanation for her actions. Reported sightings of the boy went nowhere. Investigators became frustrated by what they called hoaxes.Family members knew that Fry-Pitzen had been troubled. A woman who was close to the family and whose children played with Timmothy said she noticed something amiss the morning he was taken out of school.“I got to see him that morning before everything happened,” Linda Ramirez remembered. “She seemed very sad. I was in a hurry and I didn’t stop. I just went to work. I thought, 'I can come over later and talk to her.'”“I would love to see him again and hold him, and say that I’m sorry that I didn’t stop,” Ramirez added. “Believe it or not, his mother loved him very, very much.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/police-ex-convict-claimed-to-be-missing-boy-timmothy-pitzen/27051468,2019-04-05T09:57:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

ROME (AP) - The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.

ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.

A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.

Circumcision is not practiced among Italy’s Roman Catholic majority.

897,"Florida boy, 12, fights for his life: 'It's a prayer. It's a wish.'","Noah McKnight of DeFuniak Springs awaits a new heart at UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville.

DEFUNIAK SPRINGS — A 12-year-old fights for his life at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital in Gainesville.

Born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a congenital defect to the left side of the heart that hinders blood circulation, Noah McKnight has spent more than 200 days at the hospital awaiting a heart transplant.

His father, Andrew McKnight, said although Noah has underwent three open-heart surgeries in the past, his heart can’t sufficiently support him as he continues to grow.

“It’s a waiting game,” Andrew said. “It’s God's choice when he’s going to fulfill that. It’s a prayer. It’s a wish. It’s hope. It’s faith. It’s very emotional.”

Andrew said he moved to DeFuniak Springs from Pennsylvania with his five children in 2015. His hope was to give them a life away from the big city.

Four years ago Noah was diagnosed with bronchial casts, large obstructions within the lungs, Andrew said. Things have continued to go downhill in the last two years, he added.

After being scheduled for surgery in Pennsylvania to have the casts removed, Andrew said they traveled to Gainesville last May to have a cardiac catheterization to see if Noah’s heart was healthy enough for surgery.

It wasn’t, and the two have been at the hospital’s pediatric center since.

“There’s no other options for Noah,” Andrew said. “Noah needs to have a heart. There’s no other surgeries, no nothing that can help him gain life more than what he has already.”

In the meantime, Andrew said his oldest son, 21-year-old Nathan, has stepped up and is looking after the rest of the McKnight crew in DeFuniak Springs.

Since Noah was admitted into the hospital, Andrew said a friend of the family started a GoFundMe account to help them stay on their feet.

“It’s been a hard ride as a single parent and just being separated from the kids,” said Andrew, who added those waiting for a transplant normally only have a few-hours notice before being admitted into surgery.

“He’s only got half a heart, but he’s got more heart than most people I know,” he said.

902,Judge sentences man to 15 years in prison over role in 2 fatal crashes,"Schnider Jean was sentenced to 15 years in prison over his involvement into fatal crashes in 2013 and 2014. Miami-Dade County Department of Corrections

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - A 12-year-old boy was playing catch outside with his brother and a friend. The driver of a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro was drag racing. That afternoon turned deadly when Nicholas Murrell ran to retrieve a football from the other side of the street while Schnider Jean stepped on the gas of the fast red convertible.

Jean was racing a black Mercedes-Benz sedan. Nicholas' brother Aaron Murrell and Tyrone Maxwell saw how Jean ran him over on Dec. 12, 2013.

""They just kept on going,"" Tyrone said after the crash.

Miami Gardens Police Department detectives responded to the hit-and-run incident at Northwest 29th Avenue and 152nd Terrace and talked to Aaron and Tyrone. Nicholas died in the hospital the next day.

Seeing his older brother injured before his death haunted Aaron.

""I thought I was dreaming and I started screaming,"" Aaron said after the crash. ""When I ran to him, I was going to move him but they told me not to touch him because it was going to make it worse so I just left him.""

Surveillance video, a witness and a tip eventually helped detectives to track down the rental Chevrolet Camaro, which Jean's girlfriend had rented.

After killing Nicholas and driving away, Jean was involved in another fatal crash a few months later. He was speeding again in a 1998 Cadillac Deville. Florida Highway Patrol troopers arrested Jean and later identified the victim of that fatal crash as 75-year-old Norman Crews, a grandfather.

More than five years later, Jean, now a 28-year-old father, is feeling the weight of the criminal justice system.

Prosecutors charged him with leaving the scene of an accident causing death and reckless vehicular homicide. He was convicted of both felonies. On Friday, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Spencer J. Multack sentenced him to 15 years in prison followed by a decade of probation. Jean is being held at the Miami-Dade County Pre-Trial Detention Center.

A parent who saw the Snapchat video on her daughter's cellphone told the school resources officer about the post, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office arrest report. The video depicted what appeared to be loaded rifle magazines and additional ammunition box with a caption that read, ""I'm ready to shoot up the school"" with four laughing face emojis, the report states.

The school resource officer learned the name of the student through his user name, ""Jimmy Boy,"" and called the teen, according to the report. Deputies said when they spoke with the 17-year-old and asked if that was his screen name, he said, ""Yes, is this about the video?""

The student then added, ""It was a stupid joke and I took it down,"" adding he found the video on YouTube and posted it to his Snapchat, according to the report.

Deputies arrested the teen on one count of making written threats to kill, do bodily harm or conduct a mass shooting.

910,Dancing camel helps raise money for Shriners Hospitals for Children,"<p>A few weeks ago, News 6 showed you a video with what seemed to be a dancing camel going down State Road 408.</p><p><a href=""https://www.clickorlando.com/news/news-6-anchor-films-dancing-camel-on-state-road-408"">Anchor Matt Austin came across the unique scene</a>, and soon, the video went viral, as all of Central Florida was talking about the ""dancing"" camel.</p><p>That camel has a name and a purpose. Sir Gus Jr. is an 18-year-old camel who's been delighting not just kids, but adults, too, at charity events.<br />
 <br />
""He's an AC/DC fan, to be honest with you. He's dancing, but it's really him balancing himself back and forth as the bus goes down the road,"" Randy Morgan, president of Bahia Shrine Center, in Florida said. <br />
<br />
He's an ambassador for Bahia Shrine Center, the nonprofit organization in Central Florida that supports Shriners Hospitals for Children.<br />
<br />
Morgan said the events Sir Gus attends aim to promote and raise funds for Shriners' children's hospitals.<br />
<br />
So how is this lovable camel getting results? By puckering up in exchange for a carrot treat.</p><p><br />
 <br />
""He's just a handsome boy. That's all there is to it ... I mean, you know, where else do you get to work with a camel?"" Morgan said.<br />
<br />
The money helps pay medical bills for children with specific medical conditions.<br />
 <br />
""Regardless of what their ability to pay, (it) doesn't cost them a dime,"" Morgan said.<br />
 <br />
Shriners Hospitals for Children has 19 orthopedic centers and three burn hospitals across the country, including in Florida.<br />
<br />
One of those helped was a 12-year-old boy who had been badly burned in a 2007 plane crash in Sanford. He was treated at a burn center, where he received skin grafts and went though rehabilitation all at no cost to his family.<br />
 <br />
""I think it cost around $10 million for the Shriners to do all that,"" Morgan said. ""They didn't have to pay for anything, and that's why we're Shriners, because that's what we do for the kids. We don't do this for anything else.""<br />
 <br />
Shriners Hospitals also provide care for children born with cleft lips and cleft palates.<br />
<br />
There are currently over 2,500 kids being treated by Shriners Hospitals in Tampa.<br />
<br />
On May 4 and 5, the Shriner circus event will be taking place at Osceola Heritage Park and Sir Gus Jr. will be there ready to give out kisses for carrots.<br />
<br />
It is important to note that kids can give him his carrot treat with their hands -- only adults can do it with a quick kiss.</p>",https://www.clickorlando.com/health/dancing-camel-helps-raise-money-for-shriners-hospitals-for-children,2019-04-04T09:31:35Z,WKMG,Couple,"4466 N John Young Pkwy, Orlando, FL 32804, USA",FL,32804

917,Officers throw bullied boy a party after no one shows up for his birthday,"- When no one showed up to a little boy's birthday party in Michigan, a group of officers made sure his day would be one he wouldn't forget.

In a Facebook post, Officer Lynema with the Grand Rapids Police Department said they met 9-year-old Thomas Daniel when he missed the bus for school.

The officer offered to drive him and on the way, he learned it was Thomas's birthday. Thomas was having a birthday party that night and invited Officer Lynema. But what he told the officer next broke his heart.

""Thomas invited him to his birthday party after school but also confided that he gets bullied at school so he was afraid no one from his class would show up,"" wrote the Grand Rapids Police Department. ""Ofc. Lynema did make it to the party that evening, but unfortunately Thomas' fears came true. No one other than Ofc. Lynema and the birthday boy's siblings came.....The officer also noticed something else was missing, cake!....but he planned to fix that.""

So, the next day, Ofc. Lynema brought his teammates to surprise Thomas with a party he wouldn't forget!

When Thomas stepped off the bus, he was greeted with a Krispy Kreme donut cake, presents, and a singing quartet.

The police department says that Thomas won't have to worry about being alone next year either.

""No kid should get bullied, and no kid should worry if anyone will come to the party. Next year Thomas Daniel, make sure you drop us that invite a little sooner. We wouldn't want to miss it!""",http://www.fox35orlando.com/fast-five/officers-throw-bullied-boy-a-party-when-no-one-shows-up-for-his-birthday,2019-04-03T17:06:35Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

922,"Miami mother didn't take son to hospital after boy shot by cousin, police say","Laqayette Dock, 21, was arrested on charges of child abuse and child neglect causing great bodily harm.

MIAMI - A Miami mother was arrested Monday after she failed to take her 6-year-old son to a hospital when he was grazed by a bullet during spring break, police said.

Laqayette Dock, 21, faces charges of child abuse and child neglect causing great bodily harm.

According to an arrest affidavit, Dock was told by her son's biological father that the boy's 8-year-old cousin shot him, causing a bullet to graze his neck.

Instead of taking him to a hospital, Dock instead tried to self-treat the wound, saying she didn't think it was severe enough to require medical attention, police said.

When the boy returned to school from spring break Monday, he told the principal what happened. Paramedics were called and took the boy to Jackson Memorial Hospital to be treated.

Dock appeared in bond court Tuesday morning. She was being held at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in lieu of a $12,500 bond.

927,"Timmothy Pitzen impostor Brian Michael Rini charged, says he learned of case by watching '20/20'","CLOSE Timmothy Pitzen's family members aren't giving up hope on finding the missing boy despite the devastating development. USA TODAY

CINCINNATI — The Ohio man who claimed to be Timmothy Pitzen, an Illinois boy who went missing in 2011 at age 6, has been charged by the FBI with making false statements to a federal agent, according to the FBI and U.S. attorneys.

Brian Michael Rini, 23, was charged Friday in federal court.

According to the complaint, Rini claimed to be Timmothy and had escaped from his captors after years of sexual and physical abuse.

The federal agent said Rini refused to give his fingerprints after he was taken to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Eventually, he did agree to do a DNA swab, which was submitted to be compared with Timmothy's parents' DNA and against an FBI database.

The FBI database returned a hit for Rini.

After confronted by officers with his real identity, Rini said he heard Timmothy's story on ABC's ""20/20.""

Brian Michael Rini (Photo: Provided)

""He stated that he wanted to get away from his own family. When questioned further, Rini stated that he wished he had a father like Timmothy's because if he went missing, his father would just keep drinking,"" the complaint said.

Federal agents said Rini has presented himself as a juvenile victim of sex trafficking twice before this, according to the complaint.

Officials said Rini appeared in federal court Friday morning and he is currently in the custody of U.S. Marshals. Rini could face up to 8 years in federal prison, said U.S. Attorney Ben Glassman.

U.S. Attorney Ben Glassman said law enforcement responded to the situation ""exactly as you would hope they would,"" contacting other federal and local law enforcement.

A Cincinnati police officer working with the FBI task force spoke to Rini who insisted he was Timmothy until confronted with DNA evidence.

Glassman said the search for Timmothy is still ongoing.

More: Person found by police isn't Timmothy Pitzen. He's a 23-year-old ex-convict.

More: Timmothy Pitzen vanished in 2011. His mom wrote a note that said 'you will never find him'

""My heart goes out to the family of Timmothy Pitzen,"" Glassman said. ""I can only imagine the pain they've been through.""

Herb Stapleton, a Cincinnati FBI acting special agent in charge, said, ""false reports like this one can be painful to the families of victims,"" and also waste valuable law enforcement resources.

Stapleton said FBI agents had been speaking with Timmothy's family during the investigation this week.

Stapleton's counterpart in Louisville, Robert Brown, said the outpouring of support regarding this case ""gives everyone hope"" that Timmothy will be found.

Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco said her office performed the DNA analysis. It was completed Thursday afternoon.

Sammarco said Rini's DNA was compared to the DNA of Timmothy's parents. When that didn't match, Rini's DNA was entered into law enforcement databases.

Sammarco said this case has been difficult because ""there's no greater win for law enforcement than to find a missing child.""

Glassman said law enforcement ""moved heaven and earth to determine if they had found a missing child.""

“I think there were suspicions relatively quickly,” he said, but the priority was to ""ensure that under any circumstances a victim is getting the care they need.""

Glassman said the investigation into Rini is ongoing.

On Wednesday, Rini told police he was Timmothy, who has been missing from Illinois for nearly eight years.

He has an adult criminal record dating back to 2013.

928,Michael Bargo's parents testify at resentencing trial,"Defense calls them as witnesses

Tracy O'Brien, the mother of Michael Bargo, took the witness stand Friday and offered emotional testimony about his life.

O'Brien said her Florida-born son was normal. Under questioning by Candance Hawthorne, one of Bargo's lawyers, O'Brien said the family moved to Michigan at one point to be closer to her family.

While in Michigan, she said, Bargo got in trouble in school and experienced Attention Deficit Disorder. He was taking medication and acting out. She said he was not pleased when she and Michael Bargo Sr., her husband and Bargo's father, divorced. She said Bargo blamed her for the split.

""He took it very hard,"" O'Brien told the jury.

Bargo has been convicted and sentenced to death for murdering Seath Jackson, 15. But the Florida Supreme Court has granted him resentencing because the jury recommendation for death was only 10-2. The jury vote for death now must be unanimous; otherwise, like his co-defendants, Bargo will be sentenced to life in prison.

O'Brien told the jury that the medication Bargo took for ADD made a ""big change in him"" and diminished his appetite. He eventually was diagnosed as bipolar and with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD.)

Bargo was kicked out of school, O'Brien testified. Bargo's father moved to Marion County. O'Brien said when her son moved to be with his dad, she would call and was told everything was fine.

O'Brien said she disciplined Bargo but never abused him. She attended all his games.

Amy Berndt, an assistant state attorney, cross-examined O'Brien. Under that questioning, O'Brien said Bargo was a pretty normal child, even though he had his issues. She described him as a follower. She said he once fell in the shower and injured his head and had to be taken to the hospital.

Michael Bargo Sr. took the stand and told the court his son loved fishing and his dog and had a good relationship with his sister, who is seven years younger.

He said he did not know his son had been tested or diagnosed with ADD.

""I didn't know anything,"" he said. He believed his son was a normal, rambunctious child who needed to get out and be a child.

After the divorce, he felt his son was being kept from him. He talked to O'Brien about disciplining the boy. When Bargo moved to Marion County at age 17, he attended Belleview High School. He did not graduate, but did get his GED. He worked for some time but, when he was in Florida, did not take his medication.

Bargo's father was expected to return to the stand for the afternoon session.

Court started later than usual Friday because the defense argued that testimony offered on Thursday, during the state's presentation, put their client in a bad light and left the defense with no way to adequately respond, since Bargo's conviction stands.

Circuit Judge Anthony Tatti disagreed, and the motion for mistrial was denied.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190405/michael-bargos-parents-testify-at-resentencing-trial?rssfeed=true,2019-04-05T12:14:52Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471
929,Flagler Palm Coast High student charged with making threats to shoot up school,"A 17-year-old Flagler Palm Coast High School student was arrested early Friday after posting on the mobile social media app Snapchat that he was ready to shoot up a school, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

James G. Cooke, of Palm Coast, was charged with written threats to conduct a mass shooting, a felony, a Sheriff's Office press release states.

[READ MORE: Palm Coast boy, 14, accused of posting threatening video on social media]

[READ MORE: Flagler teen arrested, charged with threatening to shoot up school]

A visitor to the Flagler County Fair on Thursday evening alerted a deputy about a video circulating on Snapchat showing several loaded rifle ammunition magazines and ammunition with the caption, ""I'm ready to shoot up the school,"" the release states. The posting also had four laughing emojis.

Deputies tracked the account to Cooke, who admitted to posting the video but claimed it was only a joke.

When the deputy called and asked him if he had a Snapchat account with the screen name ""Jimmy Boy,"" Cooke responded ""Yeah, is this about the video?""

The deputy said yes and Cooke replied ""It was a stupid joke and I took it down.""

When the deputy drove to Cooke's home, the teenager said he had found the video on YouTube and posted it in his Snapchat story.

Cooke's father told deputies that there were no firearms or ammunition in the home.

The Flagler County Sheriff's Office said there would be an increase presence of deputies at schools today.

""As we have said many times before, this is not a joke and these threats will only get you in serious trouble,"" Sheriff Rick Staly said in a prepared statement. ""A special thank you to the fair visitor that reported the Snapchat posting. Cellphones and social media are a part of every child's life these days and it is more important than ever for parents to pay attention to what their children are doing online. Let them know that if they make the wrong choice, they will face serious consequences. We have zero tolerance for threats in Flagler County.""

While Cooke was being processed at the jail he made comments that required him to be involuntarily taken into custody under Florida's Baker Act, which allows people to be detained for a psychological evaluation.

Once Cooke is medically cleared he will be turned over to the Department of Juvenile Justice in Daytona Beach.

Flagler County Superintendent James Tager said in the press release that such threats would not be tolerated.

""We thank the Sheriff's Office for their quick work overnight and their commitment to keeping our campuses safe,"" Tager said. ""As we've said in the past, ensuring our campuses are safe for our students, teachers, and staff is our top priority. Threats such as the one in this incident will not be tolerated.""

CINCINNATI (AP) - Authorities have rejected a teenager’s claim that he is an Illinois boy who disappeared in 2011 at age 6.

The FBI says DNA testing ruled out the teenager as being Timmothy Pitzen, missing from Aurora, Illinois. Police say the story of teenager found wandering streets in Newport, Kentucky, on Wednesday didn’t check out.

The teenager told police that he was Timmothy and that he had escaped two kidnappers.

Authorities didn’t immediately release the teenager’s true identity or other information.

Timmothy Pitzen disappeared around the time his mother killed herself after leaving a note that her 6-year-old son was fine but that no one would ever find him.

934,Man dies after fall from punch by Mexican actor in alleged road rage incident,"MIAMI - A man who suffered a head injury from a fall after a Mexican actor's single punch during an alleged road rage incident has died at Jackson Memorial Hospital, a hospital employee confirmed Thursday on behalf of his family.

A witness told Miami Police Department officers that Pablo Lyle was on his way to the Miami International Airport with his family on Sunday when an enraged driver used his open hand to pound on the window of the car he was in.

The man was angry because the witness, the driver who was with Lyle, had cut him off in an attempt to make a U-turn at the intersection of Northwest 27th Avenue and Northwest 14th Street, according to the witness.

Witnesses told police officers the drivers of the two cars and Lyle got off their cars, according to the police report.

In response to the man's hostility, Lyle said he punched him once in self-defense because he was scared for his family's safety, police said. He said his 6-year-old son, Mauro, was in the back seat of the car, police said.

Lyle is married to Ana Araujo, and aside from Mauro, they also have a daughter named Arantza.

Lyle told officers he decided to run back to the car and asked the driver to hurry up and leave, after he saw another man running toward them. Witnesses said they left the victim unconscious on the street.

Lyle and the driver he was with surrendered after dropping off his family at the airport Sunday. Officers arrested him and appeared in Miami-Dade County court Monday, facing a battery charge.

Lyle is out on a $5,000 bond, and Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Lisa Walsh allowed him to travel to Mexico. Lyle published a photo Wednesday with Mauro, Arantza, Araujo, a boy, a baby, and three adults on Instagram with a caption saying, ""What really matters.""

936,Woman creating her dream of a community center for special needs kids,"PACE — Kate Bryan has a dream of building a community center that caters to everyone, including special needs children.

""We believe every child deserves an opportunity to participate in recreational or competitive athletics. At the very least, they deserve to be present in a safe, nurturing and supportive environment, which allows for building confidence and meaningful relationships,"" Bryan says on her website.

Bryan has started building her dream. It has taken her about 18 months to get her nonprofit number and designation. Her organization's official name is Children's Health And Wellness of NW Florida, Inc. doing business as Legacy Fields.

Bryan and her husband Stacy are certified registered nurse anesthetists. They have three children that excel in gymnastics, with one of them good enough to compete at national levels.

Why would a woman that is so blessed take on such a project?

""There are two reasons,"" Bryan said.

The first was a documentary she watched about an autistic little boy. It showed caretakers including the boy in groups and activities with all the other students. Bryan said the boy flourished, and that thought of inclusion and activity has never left her mind. He just needed a safe environment to make him feel welcome and included, Bryan said.

Second, Bryan said there is not a lot in Pace that will keep young people in town after they graduate from college. She hopes Legacy Fields can become a place that can attract professional, talented people and draw youth back to the community.

For Phase I , Bryan plans to have a sensory studio and play station where all abilities are welcome.

Phase II is an expanded space for health, wellness and physical education training. In addition to gymnastics and basketball, the community center plans to have quite zones for homework and tutoring, a kids corner for arts and crafts, a media center, parents lounge and multipurpose rooms.

Bryan and her board will work with pediatricians, ESE teachers, an occupational and applied behavioral analysis therapist and a physical therapist to ensure the design is on target.

937,15-year-old rescued after falling into 75-foot sand pit in Wedgewood,"A 15-year-old boy was rescued Wednesday night after he fell into a 75-foot sand pit near Capital Boulevard and Diamond Dairy Road in the Wedgewood area.

Escambia County Fire Rescue responded to a call at about 7:38 p.m. Wednesday that a teenager had fallen into the pit.

The Fire Rescue's Special Operations Team performed a ""vertical rope rescue,"" lowering three firefighters into the pit to give medical care and pull the teenager out of the pit in a medical basket, according a Facebook post from Escambia County Fire Rescue.

The teenager was transported by ambulance to Sacred Heart Hospital as a trauma alert, according to county spokeswoman Joy Tsubooka. His condition was not immediately available.

Tsubooka said the sand pit was an active, privately-owned borrow sand pit. Borrow pits are ""where a material like gravel, soil, clay or sand has been excavated for use at another location,"" according to the county website. The pits require permits in Escambia County.

The pits are required to be fenced and have proper ""no trespassing"" signage, according to Tsubooka.

940,Man sentenced for crash that killed 5-year-old,"WEST PALM BEACH — A 23-year-old Florida man has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for causing a crash that killed a 5-year-old boy.

Lex Eugene apologized for his actions Tuesday, telling the courtroom that he has brothers, nieces and nephews and can only imagine the pain that Jaydon Readon's family has endured since the 2016 crash.

Eugene was convicted in January on one count of vehicular manslaughter. Prosecutors said Eugene fled from Boynton Beach police and was driving about 60 mph in a 30 mph zone when he hit the boy as he walked to a park with his family.

Authorities said Eugene had been out of prison for just two months at the time and had accumulated drug and weapons charges by the time he turned 20.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190403/man-sentenced-for-crash-that-killed-5-year-old?rssfeed=true,2019-04-03T17:00:01Z,The Ledger,Couple,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815
941,Teen driving without license charged in fatal southwest Miami-Dade crash,"Lazaro Sanchez, 16, is accused of driving without a license in a crash that killed his 15-year-old passenger, Shandel Mio, in August 2018.

MIAMI - A 16-year-old boy is being charged as an adult in connection with a Homestead crash that killed a 15-year-old passenger in the car he was driving.

Lazaro Sanchez was arrested Tuesday. He faces one felony count of driving with a suspended license involving death.

According to an arrest warrant, Sanchez was driving a Toyota Scion without a license last August when the car veered off Southwest 112th Avenue and then crossed into oncoming traffic, slamming into two other vehicles.

Shandel Mio, a 15-year-old freshman at Homestead High School, was riding in the front passenger seat of the car at the time. He was killed in the crash.

Sanchez and three other people in the other vehicles were hurt.

According to the warrant, Sanchez never obtained or was issued a Florida driver's license.

945,3-year-old boy struck by car backing out of parking space,"DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. - A 3-year-old boy was hurt after he was struck by a car backing out of a parking space Sunday in Deerfield Beach, authorities said.

Battalion Chief Michael Kane, a spokesman for Broward Fire Rescue, said the boy somehow walked behind a car in the 200 block of Northeast 20th Avenue. The car wasn't a family member's vehicle, Kane said.

Paramedics airlifted the boy to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale. Kane said the boy's injuries did not appear to be life-threatening. He was listed in serious but stable condition.

HIGH SPRINGS — Authorities say a Florida toddler was mauled to death by a family member's dogs.

The Gainesville Sun reports that the attack occurred Friday morning at a High Springs home.

The Alachua County Sheriff's Office says the 2-year-old boy was with his grandmother as she went to her daughter's home to check on the dogs. The grandmother let the dogs out in the yard with the boy while she went inside to prepare food.

Deputies say the grandmother eventually came out of the home to find two dogs attacking the boy in a shed. The grandmother sustained serious injuries while trying to help the boy, who died at the scene.

954,Flagler County student charged with making threats on Snapchat to shoot up school,"A 17-year-old Flagler Palm Coast High School student was arrested early Friday after posting on the mobile social media app Snapchat that he was ready to shoot up a school, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

James G. Cooke, of Palm Coast, was charged with written threats to conduct a mass shooting, a felony, a Sheriff's Office news release states.

[READ MORE: Flagler teen arrested, charged with threatening to shoot up school]

A visitor to the Flagler County Fair on Thursday evening alerted a deputy about a video circulating on Snapchat showing several loaded rifle ammunition magazines and ammunition with the caption, ""I'm ready to shoot up the school,"" the release states. The posting also had four laughing emojis.

Deputies tracked the account to Cooke, who admitted to posting the video but claimed it was only a joke.

When the deputy called and asked him if he had a Snapchat account with the screen name ""Jimmy Boy,"" Cooke responded ""Yeah, is this about the video?""

The deputy said yes and Cooke replied ""It was a stupid joke and I took it down.""

When the deputy drove to Cooke's home, the teenager said he had found the video on YouTube and posted it in his Snapchat story.

Cooke's father told deputies that there were no firearms or ammunition in the home.

The Flagler County Sheriff's Office said there would be an increased presence of deputies at schools today.

""As we have said many times before, this is not a joke and these threats will only get you in serious trouble,"" Sheriff Rick Staly said in a prepared statement. ""A special thank you to the fair visitor that reported the Snapchat posting. Cellphones and social media are a part of every child's life these days and it is more important than ever for parents to pay attention to what their children are doing online. Let them know that if they make the wrong choice, they will face serious consequences. We have zero tolerance for threats in Flagler County.""

While Cooke was being processed at the jail he made comments that required him to be involuntarily taken into custody under Florida's Baker Act, which allows people to be detained for a psychological evaluation, authorities said.

Once Cooke is medically cleared he will be turned over to the Department of Juvenile Justice in Daytona Beach.

Flagler County Superintendent James Tager said in the news release that such threats would not be tolerated.

""We thank the Sheriff's Office for their quick work overnight and their commitment to keeping our campuses safe,"" Tager said. ""As we've said in the past, ensuring our campuses are safe for our students, teachers, and staff is our top priority. Threats such as the one in this incident will not be tolerated.""

955,Who are the 264 men arrested in the February day spa crackdown?,"Several spas were closed in Martin and Indian River counties, and Jupiter following an investigation into human trafficking involving sex. (Photo: TCPALM)

Blue collar to billionaires. Millennials to baby boomers.

“Boy next door.”

These descriptions characterize many of the nearly 300 men accused of buying sex during a day spa prostitution crackdown that began last July and ended with law enforcement announcing hundreds of arrests in February.

The full story:Florida human trafficking ring, prostitution in massage parlors

“These men are all ages and from all walks of life,” said Bruce Colton, the state attorney for the 19th Judicial Circuit, which covers Martin, St. Lucie, Okeechobee and Indian River counties.

“There’s people out building houses every day and people who are retired and billionaires,” he said. “There’s no limit as to who these people are.”

Police in Jupiter, Martin and Indian River counties spent months watching massage parlors, videotaping hundreds of sex acts — explicit recordings defense attorneys are now trying to get tossed out of court.

With hundreds of misdemeanor prosecutions underway, TCPalm set out to learn: Who are the men arrested in this sex-for-pay probe?

CLOSE The Vero Beach Police Department hosts a news conference Feb. 21, 2019 detailing a prostitution and human trafficking ring that was busted across Treasure Coast, Palm Beach and Orange counties. Hannah Schwab, hannah.schwab@tcpalm.com

Ten spas were shut down Feb. 19 in a series of raids authorities said were potentially linked to a Chinese human trafficking ring.

Spa customers

Undoubtedly, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, 77, who’s charged with two misdemeanor prostitution-related offenses, has garnered the most publicity. He’s accused of visiting a Jupiter spa twice and receiving sex acts that were video recorded.

More: Patriots owner Robert Kraft charged with soliciting prostitution in Florida spa

Kraft has pleaded not guilty and requested a jury trial. It’s unclear if he will attend an April 12 status hearing in his case.

Many of the 264 men accused, though, are not well-known.

Yet, using public arrest and court records that include age, hometown and other data, it’s possible to shed light on the men accused of illegally receiving sex acts at day spas in Sebastian, Vero Beach, Stuart, Hobe Sound and Jupiter.

The men charged range in age between 19 and 84. More than half are in their 50s and 60s, with a median age of 57.

Andrew Metcalf (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO FROM ANDREW METCALF)

Criminal defense attorney Andy Metcalf, who represents 30 men arrested in Indian River County, said his clients don’t fit any profiles.

“If you asked me an average age, anywhere from 30s up to 70s,” he said. “I don’t have an average client that fits into this.”

The accused men are overwhelmingly white – only 5 percent are listed in records as being any other race. Almost all are U.S. citizens, records show.

Of the 264 men charged, most of them – 238 – are from Florida.

One-tenth of the defendants have a primary residence outside the state. Every state from Virginia to Maine along the I-95 corridor, except New Hampshire, is represented among the home states of 18 of the men.

Five, including Kraft, are from Massachusetts. Two are from the South, four are from the Midwest and one comes from Colorado. One lives in Ontario, Canada.

For more than half the men arrested, police didn’t collect information on occupations. Of 126 men who had a profession listed on an arrest report, or their job could be easily found from internet searches, only nine have worked in executive-level jobs.

Additional occupations include:

25 are retired; at least 15 are veterans

27 work in construction or a related job, such as residential plumbing or carpentry

12 own a small business, from surf shops to fast food franchises to citrus farming

Four are current or former emergency first responders, including law enforcement

Three are or have been licensed massage therapists

Five work in healthcare, including two dentists, one respiratory therapist, one physical therapist and one pharmacist

Two sell cars, one is a certified public accountant; two work at local supermarkets; one teaches music; one was a visiting church deacon, before he left the position after his arrest

The men charged are considered first-time offenders, in that, they all face first-degree misdemeanors of soliciting prostitution. That charge becomes a felony for second or third-time offenders.

All spa customers arrested in Martin County face an additional misdemeanor count of “use of a structure or conveyance for prostitution.”

Sex buying market

It’s impossible to know if any of the defendants had previously engaged in the illicit sex activities related to their charges.

Experts who research the commercial sex market said only a small percentage of the U.S. male population buy sex, but some who do become habitual buyers.

Swanee Hunt, a former U. S. ambassador to Austria and founder of Demand Abolition, a Washington, D.C. group that works with survivors of prostitution, said while it’s true most men don’t buy sex, “one out of five men you know do.”

“The demographics basically match the demographics of a community that they come from,” Hunt said. “With one exception and it’s … men who are the highest frequency buyers; they call themselves ‘hobbyists,’ which is telling, and it’s a sliver.”

Ambassador Swanee Hunt (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO FROM SWANEE HUNT)

A survey study, ""Who Buys Sex?"" released in November by Demand Abolition found that “most men have never paid for sex.”

The group partnered with the University of Portland to survey 8,201 adult men nationwide over two months beginning in December 2017 to learn more about sex buying habits.

Results show 6.2 percent of the men surveyed reported buying sex in the past year and 20.6 percent had done so at least once in their lifetime.

Other findings include:

Demographic traits are poor predictors of sex buying: Race and sexual orientation have almost no profiling power.

“High-frequency” buyers account for a disproportionately large share of the illegal sex trade, estimated at $5.7 billion in the United Sates.

“’High-frequency’ buyers are much more likely than other men to make $100,00 or more annually.”

U.S. sex buyers spend more than $100 per transaction.

Only about 6 percent of men who purchase sex illegally report ever having been arrested for it.

Most communities, Hunt said, “would be so surprised to learn who the johns are.”

“It could very well be the boy next door or the man next door,” she noted. “In fact, there were some at your table at Thanksgiving dinner.”

Proving solicitation

Attorney Metcalf predicted many of his clients may be acquitted because in the dozen spa videos he’s reviewed — which don’t include audio — he didn’t see proof the men solicited prostitution.

That’s not to say the videos he’s seen didn’t show “inappropriate conduct,” Metcalf acknowledged, but not criminal behavior, he insisted.

“I haven’t seen any of my clients procure, entice, induce or solicit prostitution,” he said. “Those are the words in the statute and I have not seen that happen on any video.”

He rejected characterizing women working at the raided spas as being held in “sexual servitude,” as law enforcement authorities said when announcing arrests.

“These were sex workers, they were not slaves,” Metcalf said. “If law enforcement wants to tell me differently, then I want to know how they could sit there and watch it go on and on and not bust in the door?”

Colton declined to comment on law enforcement methods used to investigate the day spas. But he stood by authorities saying early observations indicated human trafficking was involved. He also noted that some of the women charged face RICO counts that claim human trafficking was part of their criminal enterprise.

“I’m not saying that we’re going to be able to prove a human trafficking case against anyone,” Colton said. “But I think that we have enough evidence to justify the position that we are taking with the johns in this case.”

A lack of evidence has resulted in some cases being dropped, court records show.

Four cases were dismissed in Indian River County because no exchange of cash was captured on camera, according to Assistant State Attorney Steve Wilson. The state also dropped charges against one man in Vero Beach after he was misidentified by authorities.

In Martin County, charges were dismissed against a man who was misidentified by investigators. Seven men avoided charges after prosecutors rejected arrest warrants because video recordings didn’t show proof of payment to a spa worker.

Diversions, plea deals

In Palm Beach County, Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for State Attorney Dave Aronberg, said the 25 men charged in Jupiter — including Robert Kraft — had an April 5 deadline to enter a deferred prosecution program that could result in charges being dismissed. USA Today reported Thursday Kraft will not enter that program.

The diversion program requires defendants to provide a sworn statement regarding knowledge of their illicit activity at Orchids of Asia Day Spa; pay a $5,000 civil fine, be screened for sexually transmitted diseases; complete 100 hours of community service and attend a “prostitution impact prevention education” course.

The diversion program is not considered probation and ends when all conditions are met.

Colton, though, nixed offering pretrial diversion for those charged in Martin and Indian River counties.

Defendants there have two choices: accept a plea deal or go to trial.

He’s not offering diversion, Colton said, because society and lawmakers “recognize the problems with this type of action, and the importance of trying to discourage customers … from utilizing these facilities.”

“We should be treating these cases with the seriousness with which the Legislature has recognized them,” he said.

Eve Samples: Lawmakers want mandatory 30-day jail sentences for all 'johns' in sex-trafficking cases

The plea deal he offers requires entering a guilty or no contest plea to one count of solicitation for prostitution, meaning in Martin, a second charge of “use of a structure or conveyance for prostitution” will be dropped.

Other terms include:

Pay a $5,000 fine and up to $1,200 in court costs.

Complete one-year of probation.

Perform 100 hours of community service.

Complete a human trafficking educational course.

Testing for STD/ HIV.

In exchange, a judge will withhold an adjudication of guilt.

Defendants who go to trial will face two misdemeanors, Colton added.

“A charge will be added in Indian River County,” he said, which is the use of a structure for prostitution.

Further, defendants captured on video at a spa can expect the recording to be played during a trial.

“We do intend to introduce those videos as evidence,” Colton said.

957,"Complaint: LCS denied student proper disability services, retaliated against mother","A mother has filed a complaint against the Leon County School Board alleging the district misdiagnosed her son's learning disability and retaliated against her. (Photo: Getty Images)

A complaint filed by the mother of a Leon County seventh grader alleges the school district misdiagnosed the student's learning disabilities and retaliated against her for advocating on his behalf.

The grievance, filed against the Leon County School Board in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida last week, said the district failed the student and his mother and violated its obligations under the Individual with Disabilities Act through a ""persistent pattern of willful neglect."" It also claims the district blamed the student and mother for its failure to address her concerns and accommodate his disability.

""As a practice, we do not comment on open litigation,"" said LCS spokesman Chris Petley. ""We look forward to an amicable conclusion for all involved.""

In July, the mother filed an administrative complaint regarding her son's lack of progress, according to the lawsuit. A due process hearing was held in November and the following month an administrative law judge denied the mother's request, claiming she failed to send her son to school enough. The mother disputes that judge's findings.

The mother, who filed the complaint on her own behalf and is known only as LR under a court-approved privacy request, said her son has a disorder of written expression, but the district evaluated and labeled him autistic. He was privately tested by a licensed clinical psychologist who said the student had dysgraphia, a form of dyslexia, and that autism was not evident in the child, according to the lawsuit.

His mother said in her complaint one of the ""major roadblocks"" in educating her son is LCS' contention that his spelling and writing problems stem from his lack of desire to learn and perform the tasks.

The district, according to the complaint, manipulated records and evaluation scores to ""make it appear on paper that (the boy) has no learning problems."" In one instance, the grievance alleges, an administrator submitted an essay written by a peer as a writing sample of the student.

The mother claimed the district retaliates against her for advocating for her child. She cited one instance when the same administrator who manipulated records called her ""scary and crazy"" in front of her son and another teacher and depicted him as having ""mental problems"" in a public cafeteria.

The complaint seeks $150,000 for the district failing to provide a free and appropriate education and to reimburse the mother for educational resources and time off of work. The mother also wants a judge to declare her son's educational plan deficient, order he be designated with a specific learning disability and remove references of autism from his record, among other district acknowledgements of poor treatment.

958,Meet the Pennsylvania hotel manager who went viral for for a simple act of kindness,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

MONROE TOWNSHIP, Pa. — A Pennsylvania man had no idea the impact a simple interaction would have on a boy and his family.

Kahlief Hill said he meets a lot of people as a manager of the Selinsgrove Hampton Inn. Over the weekend, he was checking in the Haas family from Frackville. Hill was on the phone when 13-year-old Colin Haas asked if he could show him a card trick.

“I said, ‘Why not? I’m on hold. I have time,'” Hill recalled.

Colin and Hill exchanged card tricks for the next half hour.

“The next night they came in from dinner. I said, ‘Hello, how are you?’ I said, ‘How are you doing with the magic trick I showed you yesterday?’ He said, ‘I can’t remember.’ I said, ‘Come back out, I’ll show you again,'” Hill recalled.

Colin’s mom Megan snapped a picture of the two working on card tricks a second time.

After Colin went to bed, his mom thanked Hill and said people are usually quick to dismiss her son, who has autism. Colin’s father passed away a few years ago, and he does not have a strong male role model in his life.

Megan Haas posted about the act of kindness on Facebook, and Hill woke up the next morning to nearly 900 friend requests.

“That post popped up, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God,’ and I instantly started crying,” he said.

The post quickly went viral and has been shared thousands of times. Hill's manager Jason Gabany saw it, too.

“‘I think that’s Kahlief. That is Kahlief! That’s our property, that’s so cool!'” Gabany recalled saying.

The Hampton Inn does special fundraisers during Autism Awareness Month, but Gabany said Hill’s act of kindness had nothing to do with that.

“For him to take the time to see that somebody just wanted to be entertained a little bit, he had the time to do it, he wanted to do it and he took good care of him with it,” Gabany said.

Colin’s mom said Hill’s act of kindness made his whole weekend.

“I’m so happy that I was able to help make his day a little brighter, not realizing how I impacted,” Hill said.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/04/03/meet-the-pennsylvania-hotel-manager-who-went-viral-for-for-a-simple-act-of-kindness/,2019-04-03T22:10:21Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394

Two people – including a 15-year-old boy – remain in custody in connection with the shooting of a man in a residential neighborhood on Sunday.

The 15-year-old – whose name is not being released by FLORIDA TODAY because he is a juvenile – was charged with aggravated battery with a 9mm while a second suspect, Isaiah Vanderwarker, 18, was charged with tampering with evidence, reports show.

It was not immediately clear who owned the gun or what the motive might have been. It was also not known how the suspects knew the victim or if the shooting was random.

Police said three people, including Vanderwarker and the other suspect, met at the spot when the juvenile pulled out a black handgun and fired at least one round. The victim – believed to have been shot in the leg - was airlifted to Holmes Regional Medical Center where he underwent surgery.

Police said Vanderwarker – who lived a block from the shooting site - took the handgun in the shooting and threw it into a wooded area.

Both Vanderwarker and the teen were arrested.

960,Viera H.S. lacrosse player collapses from cardiac arrest,"- As the Viera High School boy's varsity lacrosse team took the field for Tuesday night's game, there was one junior varsity player missing.

Tenth-grader Colin Seely should have been there, supporting his fellow Hawks. Instead, he was at a local children’s hopstal fighting for his life.

He collapsed the day before during ROTC training from a cardiac arrest.

Head football coach Derek Smith and Col. Tim Thomas we’re outside when Colin was running laps. They were the first ones by his side when he collapsed.

“When I turned him over, he was already turning purple and there was just a light pulse,” Thomas said.

“Worrying about the kid not making it and having to look someone in the eye and that kid didn't make it, that was the scary part.” Smith said.

The coaches called over for the school’s AED machine, and administering CPR. Minutes later, medics arrived.

Colin’s medical emergency happened at the same time districts around Central Florida are debating whether to test student athletes for heart conditions.

Osceola County is moving forward, even offering to help test those who cannot afford to pay for it. Brevard County has not come to a decision yet.

Orlando nursing school student, Lexi Sima, is a Viera High School graduate. She also suffered from cardiac arrest when she was 16 years old.

“You cannot put a price on a life. It’s just that simple,” she said.

She and her dad now go to high schools around the area administering EKG tests to high schoolers. The group ""Who We Play For"" then sends the tests to local cardiologists.

961,Justice for Jayden: Man sentenced to 30 years for killing boy while fleeing police,"Justice for the family of a 5-year-old boy killed by a man trying to outrun police.

On Tuesday afternoon, a judge sentenced Lex Eugene to the maximum of 30 years for the murder of Jayden Readon.

The sentencing lasted more than two hours; all of it very emotional.

Once the verdict came, Jayden Readon’s family was pleasantly surprised, but they say it still hurts because even the maximum sentence can’t bring little Jayden back.

“It’s in the hand of God at the end of the day,” said Marisella Readon, Jayden’s mother.

Readon has been fighting for her son ever since he was taken from her in 2016.

Eugene, 23, hit and killed Jayden along Miner Road near Boynton Beach as he tried to outrun police in a high-speed chase.

On Tuesday, a judge sentenced Eugene to the maximum 30 years for vehicular homicide.

One by one, Jayden’s family took the stand to fight for him one last time hoping for that result.

“I’m his voice, he doesn’t have a voice here, so I will forever be his voice,” Readon said.

Jayden’s mother says Eugene should’ve never been in Jayden’s path.

He was out on bond just two weeks before the crash with a long criminal record.

“You can’t continue to do wrong and then nothing is done to you,” Readon said.

Jayden’s older brother took the stand too. He and his great-grandparents were with Jayden when he was hit.

He read his statement through tears, so overcome with emotion that he couldn’t finish.

He walked out of court shortly after.

Readon says this sentence is a bittersweet victory.

“It’s not anything to be, 'Hey we did it.' Because he’s still not here,” she said.

Readon says Jayden’s death will hopefully teach others to think twice.

“Think twice about running from the cop , doing what you’re going to do,” she said.

He will serving at least 28 years behind bars, then he’s eligible for an early release.

963,"13-year-old son trades Xbox, does yard work to buy single mom car","FERNLEY, Nev. - Mother's Day is still over a month away, but one young boy already bought his single mom the best gift imaginable.

Krystal Preston and her three children have gone through pain and heartache recently, and found the going tougher without a car to get around their Nevada town.

So Preston's 13-year-old son William came up with a plan to make sure his mother suffered no more, and got the idea after watching online videos.

""I saw on YouTube where people get their mom a car and then surprise her with it,” William told KOLO. “I wanted to do that.""

William took the money he made doing yard and house work in his neighborhood, and combined it with money he got for trading in his Xbox and told his mom he was buying her a car.

The boy found a 1999 Chevrolet Metro for sale on Facebook.

“It was really cheap so I asked her if I could trade it or earn it, and at first she said no and after she thought about it, then she said yes,"" William said.

On his own, William negotiated a deal with the woman selling the car and then came home to surprise his mother.

""Mom, I got you a car and she didn't believe me,"" William said.

But when Krystal walked outside, the woman was standing outside and took the two to her house where the car was waiting for them.

""I lost it, I bawled, I was just like, there's no way,” Krystal says. “And then she gave me the keys and the paperwork.""

Krystal posted about her son's good deeds on Facebook.

""I am so proud of my son,"" she wrote. ""He is such a good kid. He may have his days but OMG what 13 year old kid do you know that buys his mom a car... William I love you son and thank you. You have such a big heart and I love you...""

966,Mother claims son's head stomped at Jacksonville day care,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Jacksonville mother is calling for a state investigation into a Northside day care after her 8-year-old boy was hospitalized with a head injury.

The mother, whom we’ll refer to in this story as Jenny, said she was picking up her son Friday from Brighter Futures Learning Center on Lem Turner Road when she witnessed the unthinkable.

“I see a boy just stomping him in the face,” she told News4Jax on Monday. “Punching him and stomping him and stomping him, so immediately I went berserk.”

Jenny said her son was having an asthma attack and complaining of head pain, so she drove him to UF Health Jacksonville, where he was given breathing treatments and diagnosed with a head injury.

On Monday, News4Jax stopped by the Brighter Futures location to speak with the owner. She disputed the mother’s version of events, saying there was only a minor tussle over a game of basketball.

Jenny isn’t convinced, though. She has filed reports with the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office and the Department of Children and Families. News4Jax has requested copies of those reports.

“Just imagine you being a mom and you see this big kid stomping your kid in the head,” she said. “A little girl (in South Carolina) just died from that. You know what I’m saying? That’s unacceptable.”

The case she’s referring to is that of Raniya Wright, a fifth grade student from Waltersboro, South Carolina, who died March 27 -- two days after the 10-year-old was injured in a fight at school.

Jenny said her son wasn’t bruised or bleeding after Friday’s incident, but she noted that he was diagnosed with a mild concussion and had an asthma attack in the car afterward.

“I was so mad,” she said. “I’m so angry about that because, even if she couldn’t see, you should have enough people out there watching (the children).”

Sanibel police have closed a one-day investigation into a 4-year-old boy who fell from a third-story condominium window Sunday afternoon at the Shell Island Beach Club of Periwinkle Way.

The boy survived the initial fall and was taken to the hospital. His condition is unknown.

""No charges are being filed,"" Sanibel police Chief William Dalton said, after confirming the investigation had concluded.

Sanibel Director of Community Services Keith Williams said any further action, legal or otherwise, would be between condominium representatives and the family.

Williams did say that Sanibel building requirements dictate a need for screens and windows that can be removed.

""You need to have windows that open for escape,"" he said.

A condominium official declined comment.

The department's report blacked out the boy's name but referred to him as a 4-year-old.

The boy's parents, Melissa and Elizabeth Koch, told police that they had arrived at the condo site the night before. Melissa Koch said did not remember if the window was open when they arrived.

Melissa Koch said Elizabeth Koch was in another room trying to put another child down for a nap while the 4-year-old had pushed a curtain aside to look out the window.

Melissa Koch said she went to the window and saw her son on the mulch-filled ground next to the bent window screen three-stories below.

Police arriving at the scene said the boy appeared to have difficulty breathing and had reddened skin on his back but that there was no blood or open wounds visible.

The child was taken to Lee Memorial and then transferred to Golisano Children's Hospital.

970,'The time has come': Florida lawmakers want apology for 'lives ruined' by Johns Committee,"Senator Johns discussing plans to screen-out homosexuals in 1963. (Photo: State Archives of Florida, Florida Memory)

The Florida Legislature appears unlikely this session to revisit its nine-year effort in the 1950s and '60s to rid public education of subversive professors, civil rights groups and homosexuals.

Rep. Evan Jenne, D-Broward, and Sen. Lauren Book, D-Broward, want lawmakers to acknowledge the state was wrong to fund a legislative committee that historians say forced hundreds of students to quit their university studies and professors and public school teachers to lose their jobs.

“These people deserve to be apologized to,” said Jenne. “For nearly a decade, the House and Senate went around ruining people’s live completely and solely based on the color of their skin and their sexual orientation.”

Buy Photo Rep. Evan Jenne, D-Dania Beach. (Photo: Democrat files)

The Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, commonly known as the Johns Committee, chaired by former state senator and governor Charley Eugene Johns, existed from 1956 to 1965.

Its legislative mandate was to “investigate all organizations whose principles or activities included a course of conduct on the part of any person or group which could constitute violence, or a violation of the laws of the state.”

Those words enabled Johns to deploy uniformed, armed state troopers and investigators on campuses to inquire about, among other things:

Florida A&M University faculty connection to the Tallahassee bus boycott

Links between the NAACP and communists

The activities of political organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as well as pro- and anti-Castro groups

Homosexual activities.

'It was a sham'

Air Force veteran Art Coppleston was 25 years old when he was marched out of an accounting final by a police officer at the University of Florida to be interrogated by the Johns Committee in 1957.

“I came to realize that they, as a group, were really a very dumb bunch of redneck illiterate people, clumsily wielding a vast amount of powers over others,” Coppleston told documentary producer Allyson A. Beutke.

The younger members of the generation of college students the Johns Committee focused on are now well into their 70s. Their memories have been documented by student film makers and historians at UF, the University of Central Florida and the University of South Florida.

Investigators told Chuck Wood in 1959 they had information he was gay and wanted to help him.

""Of course, had I admitted to it, I would have been kicked out of the University of Florida,"" Wood recounted to the University of Central Florida's David Moran in 2011.

""I told them I would tell my father, who was a colonel in the Army and that he would probably end up suing the University of Florida over this,"" said Wood. ""That was the last I heard from them.""

Jenne maintains the committee's work was ""a sham.""

""It was the middle of the Red Scare and they said they went after the NAACP because black people would be easier to turn into communists. They went after folks in the LGBTQ community because they would be easier to turn into communists, but what they really wanted to do was to make it as hard as possible to desegregate Florida.""

A resolution and ruined lives

Jenne and Book drew on the university research to construct a timeline of the committee’s work. The resolution is airtight, Jenne said. Not “one word,” he said, can be debated for historical accuracy.

The proposed House resolution contains a timeline that starts with the Johns Committee's first public hearing. In 1957, lawmakers questioned Virgil Hawkins, an African-American who had been trying to enter the University of Florida law school since 1949. The committee charged his lawyers broke state law by seeking out Hawkins to provide legal representation.

The next year the committee began an inquiry of gays among the faculty, staff and students at UF. And in 1959, the committee reported to the Legislature that “homosexual professors were recruiting students into ‘homosexual practices’ and they in turn were becoming teachers in Florida’s public-school system and recruiting even younger students.”

The Johns Committee formed during the Cold War and Red Scare of the 1950s and evolved into a Florida version of the Lavender Scare of that era. The committee calculated there were more than 60,000 homosexuals living in Florida.

Its focus on the gay community was such that its 1964 publication “Homosexuality and Citizenship in Florida,” was criticized as “state-sponsored pornography” for its depictions of homosexual activity. The Legislature spent $720 to print 2,000 copies.

The book produced such outrage that lawmakers eliminated funding for the committee the next year and sought to seal the committee’s 30,000 pages of documents for 71 years.

At least one attempted suicide is linked to the committee’s work along with more than 100 professors and public school teachers losing their jobs. More than 400 students were forced to drop out of college, according to researchers.

“I was only a kid. I had my whole life ahead of me, but I can’t help to think of the professors who were near retirement and literally had their lives ruined,” Ruth Jensen-Forbell recounted in a 2011 UCF documentary.

“And the state needs to be responsible,” said Jensen-Forbell, a minister who founded the First Coast Metropolitan Community Church.

No apology?

Johns was unapologetic about the committee's work.

In 1959, he wrote a letter to UF President J. Wayne Reitz to thank him for his cooperation with investigators and the firing of faculty and staff that the committee had exposed.

“Let me congratulate you again, Doctor, on your difficult job and say that I am glad you do not shirk your responsibility,” Johns wrote to Reitz. “I have told many people that when the “cards were down Dr. Reitz was not lacking.”

Documentary maker Beutke, in “Behind Closed Doors,” unearths this quote reportedly said by Johns in 1972: “I don’t get no love out of hurting people. But that situation in Gainesville, my Lord have mercy. I never saw nothing like it in my life. If we saved one boy from being made homosexual, it was justified.""

Jenne calls the committee’s work the most egregious example of the Legislature ruining Floridians' lives.

“I think it is time we say we are sorry,” said Jenne. “And that we were wrong. We were wrong.”

But the proposal has yet to be scheduled for a hearing. With just six weeks left in the session, Jenne does not think there is time to get it through both chambers.

“I’m being told by the powers that there just isn’t the appetite for it this year,” said Jenne. “We will be back next year. And we will file this bill this summer on the very first day filing opens for the 2020 session.”

But anything can happen during session.

Friday, House Speaker Jose Oliva said he's willing to discuss the issue. Meanwhile, Sen. President Bill Galvano told the Tallahassee Democrat he supports the resolution.

971,11-year-old gets 16 stitches after shark bite on Florida beach,"STUART, Fla. (WFLA/WPTV) – An 11-year-old boy from Iowa is recovering after he was bitten by a shark while on vacation in Florida.

Kael Dewey said he was riding his boogie board at Stuart Beach on Tuesday when he sensed something wasn’t right.

Dewey was in the water with his mom when he felt something grab the back of his leg.

That’s when he said he immediately screamed out for help.

""All of a sudden he started screaming and said, ‘I got bit really bad,’"" his mother Jessica Dewey said.

""A lot of people there, they brought me on to the beach. Wrapped my foot up in a towel,” said Kael.

It’s not clear what kind of shark bit Kael, but the family suspects it was a spinner shark.

972,Police: Dad brought loaded AK-47 to Florida middle school,"The father showed up at school, forgetting he had the weapon tucked in his pants, he told police.

WEST PALM BEACH — When Christopher Freeman's son FaceTimed him in tears Monday afternoon from school, the 27-year-old father knew something was wrong.

The boy told Freeman that a teacher at Bear Lakes Middle School had ""slammed him,"" according to Freeman's statement to Palm Beach County School District police, and while they were on the video call, Freeman saw an adult grab the boy.

The phone went flying and the call ended, so Freeman hurried to the school on Shenandoah Boulevard, forgetting that he had a loaded AK-47 tucked in his pants, he said.

Freeman, who lives outside the city limits, was arrested by school district police on charges of aggravated assault, possessing a weapon on school property and disturbing the peace. A judge ordered he be held in the Palm Beach County Jail on a $75,000 bond. If he is released, he cannot have contact with any Palm Beach County schools and will be on in-house arrest.

An administrator who spoke with Freeman on the phone before he arrived at the school warned a school officer that the father was upset. The arrest report is vague as to why school staff was talking to the boy.

The school district would not comment on anything involving Freeman's son. A woman who answered a call to a telephone number listed as Freeman’s said Freeman’s boy is doing OK. As far was Freeman’s arrest, she said, “We have no comment on that at this time.”

An officer noticed Freeman, who uses a wheelchair, outside the front office shortly before 4 p.m.

""I want to see the guy who slammed my son. I've got something for him,"" Freeman reportedly said. ""You're going to need more than what you've got because of what I've got.""

The officer noticed ""what looked like the handle of a handgun"" sticking out of Freeman's pants.

The officer put the school on a code-red lockdown, meaning no one could enter the building and no one inside could move from their classrooms, and called for backup when Freeman resisted the officer's attempts to search him.

Police found a loaded AK-47 pistol Mini Draco with an extended magazine, which appeared to be fully loaded with 30 rounds, on him. One round was in the chamber, according to police records.

Freeman told officer he keeps the gun with him for protection, adding that he never intended to use it to hurt anyone at the school.



Principal Kirk Howell said in a telephone call to parents Monday afternoon that ""the parent never brandished the gun or threatened the office staff with it at any time.""

Court records indicate Freeman is facing weapons- and drug-related charges stemming from a February 2018 traffic stop during which he told Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies he had guns, for which he said he had permits to carry, in his car. He is scheduled to go to trial in that case next month.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190312/police-dad-brought-loaded-ak-47-to-florida-middle-school?rssfeed=true,2019-03-12T10:09:00Z,The Ledger,Couple,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815
973,Video reportedly shows Florida school bus aide snatch MAGA hat off boy's head,"MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA/CNN) - A video captured the moment a school bus aide in Martin County grabbed a ""Make America Great Again"" hat off a boy's head after he ignored her demands that he take it off.

WPTV reports that the Martin County Sheriff’s Office is investigating a school bus aide after an incident at Hidden Oaks Middle School.

Gunnar Johansson, 14, told the news station it was hat day at the school and he decided to wear a Trump, Make America Great Again hat, “to show my pride in Trump America.""

Seconds after boarding his bus to go to school, the bus aide, who has not been identified, asked him to remove his hat.

“Boy, if you don’t that that hat off this bus… take it off. Take that hat off… take that hat off…” the woman is heard saying.

“I was really confused, I was like ‘I can’t wear this?’ “Johansson recalled.

The bus aide also asked the teenager to remove his backpack and continued to tell him to take off the hat.

“She, like, threatened me with a referral and threatened to turn the bus around. I said ‘write me up, I didn’t do anything wrong’, and then she yanked my hat off. It was crazy,” Johansson said.

Johansson did not wear his hat for the remainder of the bus ride, but says other students were allowed to keep their hats on.

His mother, Jackie Putt said she went to the school and spoke to the principal after other parents told her about the incident.

“I needed to know what my son just went through and what she did to my son,” Putt said.

Putt learned she would not be able to see surveillance video of the incident until the school district's investigation is complete, so she went to police.

WPTV reports Martin County Lieutenant Ryan Grimsdale plans to review the video and interview those involved.

“The crux of our investigation will be the interaction directly, physically with the child and how that panned out,” Grimsdale said.

“The district is aware of the family’s allegations. We’re taking it very seriously. We’re in the process of gathering all the facts right now,” said Frank Frangella, Director of Safety and Security for the Martin County School District.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)

The 13 players who survived the Humboldt Broncos bus crash one year ago in Canada are dealing with injuries ranging from paralysis and back pain to brain damage and mental health issues. A synopsis from The Canadian Press:

GRAYSEN CAMERON

The 19-year-old forward can’t play hockey again after suffering back injuries, a concussion and an eye injury. He had surgery in November to remove metal rods and screws in an attempt to improve his mobility. He has become an assistant coach for the Red Deer Optimist Chiefs, a team in the Alberta Midget Hockey League. Cameron had played with the team from 2015 to 2017 before joining the Broncos.

BRAYDEN CAMRUD

The 20-year-old forward overcame a severe concussion, loss of feeling in his left arm and neck problems. He also had some cuts on his hands. He has returned to play with the Broncos this season. Camrud continues to attend physiotherapy as a result of his injuries.

“Eventually I overcame everything and I’m here now,” he said in September. “I’d say I’m close to 100% now and good to go.”

KALEB DAHLGREN

The 21-year-old forward suffered a fractured skull, a puncture wound in his head, a brain injury and six broken vertebrae in his back and neck. He also had blood clots in one arm and behind an eardrum. He is still in rehabilitation and is seeing a neurologist to determine if he will be able to play competitive hockey. He attends York University in Toronto full time and has committed to play for the university’s Lions hockey team.

“We are unsure if he will ever be able to play hockey again. His entire life revolved around hockey,” his family said in a victim impact statement during a court sentencing hearing in January for the truck driver who caused the crash. “This accident has certainly turned his life upside down, not to mention that the brain injury significantly slowed his reading ability ... We are unsure what the future holds but are thankful Kaleb survived the accident.”

BRYCE FISKE

The 21-year-old defenseman suffered a neck fracture, skull fracture, left shoulder fracture and pelvis fracture. His spleen was lacerated and his left lung was punctured. His jaw was fractured in four places. He’s missing two teeth and his tongue was severely injured. Fiske is studying commerce and playing hockey for the Ridgebacks at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology.

“Currently, Bryce is able to move freely on his own,” said a statement of facts entered at the sentencing hearing. “He has a significant amount of jaw pain and is still in treatment for his injuries. The majority of his treatment is for his jaw; he will require at least one more surgery for his jaw to be reconstructed.”

MORGAN GOBEIL

The 19-year-old defenseman has a traumatic brain injury. He sustained multiple skull fractures, three facial fractures, broken ribs and lacerations to his liver and spleen. His family said in a statement in March that he spent 333 days in hospital. He has not yet regained his ability to walk or talk, but the family remains hopeful he will someday experience those milestones.

“He has endured many medical procedures and hours upon hours of physical, occupational, and speech therapy,” said his parents. “During his time at the hospital, Morgan has celebrated his high school graduation, his brother’s wedding, his 19th birthday, several holidays and he has witnessed the change of all four seasons.”

MATTHIEU GOMERCIC

The 21-year-old forward had a separated shoulder, a concussion and cuts to his hand and chin. His spleen was enlarged, his teeth shifted and his jaw was slightly displaced. He still gets headaches and has problems with one shoulder. Gomercic has joined the Ridgebacks at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology and is studying kinesiology. He continues to deal with emotional issues on a daily basis.

“My son remembers moments before the accident and then remembers waking up outside the bus in the middle of this disaster,” his mother, Joanne Girard-Gomercic, wrote in her victim impact statement. “Although he was in a lot of pain, he got up and looked around to see where he was. He was convinced it was a nightmare because he could not believe that what he was seeing was real. What he saw and heard that night will affect him for the rest of his life, in ways that are hard to predict.”

XAVIER LaBELLE

The 19-year-old defenseman suffered a fractured skull, facial fractures and deep lacerations, as well as a brain injury that led to amnesia for two weeks. The severe injuries made him unrecognizable after the crash, which resulted in a misidentification that led to further chaos and heartbreak. He continues to undergo surgeries and faces daily challenges.

“As a young man, Xavier has shown unbelievable courage over the last nine months as he comes to terms with his injuries and the terrible loss of so many teammates, friends and mentors,” said his mother, Tanya LaBelle, in her victim impact statement. “Xavier’s injuries have affected him physically, mentally and emotionally. His goal and dream to play a higher level of hockey through a hockey scholarship was suddenly and brutally taken away from him in the most horrific circumstances.”

LAYNE MATECHUK

The 19-year-old defenseman suffered a severe brain injury. He had extensive facial fractures and a sternum fracture. Both of his lungs collapsed. He was in a coma for a month and had to learn to walk and talk again, but has left the hospital. He is able to walk with a significant limp. He also has difficulty using his one arm due to the brain injury.

“Layne has a traumatic brain injury which has left him to be such a different son than we had before the accident,” his father, Kevin Matechuk, said in his victim impact statement. “He is angry and confused and cannot understand why this has happened and how his life has changed so much. These injuries have taken away everything. His dream to play hockey has been taken away.”

DEREK PATTER

The 20-year-old forward suffered bleeding outside his brain, as well as right shin and fibula fractures, a nasal bone fracture and significant cuts and bruises. He continues to struggle with his leg and a surgeon has recently told him he has more healing to do.

“He has recovered enough to return to playing with the Broncos organization this year,” his parents, Roy and Laurel Patter, said in their victim impact statement. “Being one of the survivors brings immense stress for such young men: From grieving the loss of the 16 people that they were very, very close with all at once ... to dealing with the recovery of their own injuries and the changes in their physical abilities ... to watching each other struggle with recovery both mentally and physically while trying to stay strong for each other.”

NICK SHUMLANSKI

The 21-year-old forward sustained a fractured bone behind his ear and a lumbar avulsion fracture, but walked away from the crash. He has been told his ear may never heal but he doesn’t expect that will have a significant effect. His back seems to have healed, but he continues to deal with emotional issues. Shumlanski is playing hockey for the University of Prince Edward Island Panthers in Charlottetown.

“Nick began counselling shortly after his release from the hospital,” said his sister, Sydney Shumlanski, in her victim impact statement. “It has been almost one year since the accident, and he is still unable to get onto a charter bus with his teammates in P.E.I. and go to the away games. He either drives himself to the games or joins someone from the coaching staff.”

TYLER SMITH

The 20-year-old forward had two broken ribs, a broken shoulder blade, a broken collarbone and a punctured lung. He had part of his small intestine removed due to the injuries. He also had a stroke and is expected to require annual MRIs. Smith returned to play with the Broncos in the fall, but decided to leave the team to continue his recovery at home. He said his physical injuries are nothing compared to the mental health issues some of his teammates face.

“There are a lot of guys that have to live with the pictures in their minds,” said Smith. “That’s something I would never wish for anybody.”

RYAN STRASCHNITZKI

The 19-year-old defenseman suffered a concussion, brain bleeding, an injured right shoulder blade and a collapsed right lung. He was paralyzed from the chest down and the injury is expected to be permanent. Straschnitzki played in an exhibition sledge hockey charity game in Calgary in September and is hoping to eventually represent Canada at the Winter Olympics.

“I am beyond heartbroken that my big, beautiful boy will never get to realize his dreams in stand-up hockey,” said his mother, Michelle Straschnitzki, in her victim impact statement.

“Ryan has near-perfect recall of the crash and the ensuing carnage,” she said. “I cry daily over all that was lost that night.”

JACOB WASSERMANN

The 19-year-old goalie suffered a brain injury, a broken shoulder blade, fractured ribs and nasal bone fractures. Both of his lungs collapsed and a spinal cord injury resulted in paralysis from the navel down. Wassermann attends physiotherapy three times a week to get stronger and learn new ways to live with paralysis. He has started to have movement in his hips, his father, Kirby Wasserman, said in November. He has also turned to sledge hockey to keep his on-ice dream alive.",http://www.wfla.com/national/healing-slow-to-come-for-some-after-humboldt-crash/1904687376,2019-04-06T17:40:30Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
979,State rests in Bargo resentencing trial,"Forensics expert and medical examiner among Thursday's witnesses; defense starts presenting its case on Friday

Prosecutors on Thursday rested their case in the resentencing trial of Michael Shane Bargo.

Assistant State Attorneys Amy Berndt and Robin Arnold took turns questioning more than 10 witnesses, including sheriff's deputies, forensic specialists, a firearm examiner, medical officials, and those who talked with Bargo about killing 15-year-old Seath Jackson.

James Williams Sr. said Bargo told him he had killed someone and burned his body. He said Bargo told him how many times he shot the victim and details on how and when the murder occurred.

One of Bargo's lawyers, Candance Hawthorne, quizzed Williams about her client's state of mind and asked his impression of Bargo. Williams said at first he did not believe Bargo and was trying to figure out what Bargo told him. He said he never contacted law enforcement, and said Bargo told him the reason he killed the person was because the victim had raped a girl who was close to him.

Bargo, along with co-defendants Amber Wright, Kyle Hooper, Charlie Ely and Justin Soto, have been convicted of Seath’s murder. The co-defendants were sentenced to life in prison, but Bargo was sentenced to death.



In October 2016, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that juries must unanimously recommend death sentences. Bargo’s jury voted 10-2 for death. In June 2017, the Florida Supreme Court granted Bargo resentencing.

Crystal Anderson testified that Bargo told her he was in trouble and had done something crazy. She said he told her he had killed someone and she thought he was not being serious. Anderson said Bargo went into details about shooting the victim eight times, including twice in the face, and burning the boy's body after beating him.

Anderson said she never said anything to anyone because she was scared. When Bargo was arrested in Starke, she said she did not read anything about the murder on social media or any news outlets.

Hawthorne asked Anderson about Bargo's mood. She said when she first met Bargo, she considered him a happy-go-lucky person. But when he was in Starke with them, he was acting sad and depressed as if something was bothering him. Anderson said Bargo told her he did it, meaning the crime.

James Williams Sr. said when Bargo told him about the killing, he told him to turn himself in. Williams said he was shocked.

After his arrest in Starke, Bargo was transferred to the Marion County Jail. There, a fellow inmate, William Faulker, testified Bargo freely told him that the person he killed had raped a girlfriend and he killed him, making reference to Seath. Faulker said he never told anyone about that conversation until three weeks later, when he was released.

In the morning session, Arnold questioned Mike Proctor, the man who gave Bargo the firearm that was used to shoot Seath.

Proctor told Arnold he called the Marion County Sheriff's Office to report that bit of information because it was ""the right thing to do.""

The .22-caliber weapon, together with the box it came in, was given to Bargo in exchange for yard work Bargo did, Proctor said.

Following Proctor's time on the witness stand, sheriff's official Lisa Berg testified about locating Seath's remains and outlined the careful steps taken to preserve the evidence. During this testimony, Seath's mother, Sonia Jackson, left the courtroom.

Seath's body was burned in a burn pit and the remains were placed in buckets. Dr. Michael Warren, retired director of the University of Florida CA Pound Human Identification Laboratory, testified about how those remains were analyzed and determined to be Seath's.

Dr. Kyle Shaw of the Medical Examiner's Office in Leesburg was able to review the evidence, both from the scene and at his office. He told the jury how he concluded that Seath died from a gunshot wound and blunt force trauma.

Hawthorne asked Shaw if he could determine which came first: the gunshot or the blunt force trauma. Shaw said he could not and said a combination of the two caused the teen's death.

Maria Pagan, a firearms examiner, talked about testing the gun used to shoot the teen.

The defense is expected to present its case to jurors starting Friday.

982,Mexican actor lands in jail after alleged road rage incident in Miami,"MIAMI - Pablo Lyle has had his share of drama on Mexican soap operas. He has starred on ""Mi Adorable Maldición,"" ""La Sombra Del Pasado"" and ""Corazón Que Miente."" This weekend, police officers said his whirlwind of passion was in the streets of Miami.

The 32-year-old celebrity made it to the People en Español's 50 Most Beautiful list about four years ago, but on Sunday night, things got ugly for him. Witnesses told officers they saw Lyle get out of the passenger side of a car to punch a man in the face, knocking him unconscious.

Witnesses said Lyle got back in the car and the driver sped away, but not without someone writing down the license plate. Miami Fire Rescue paramedics rushed the victim to Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.

Officers learned the driver, who was with Lyle, lives in Miami's Brickell neighborhood. The two said they decided to surrender to police officers after taking Lyle's family to Miami International Airport, according to the police report.

The driver told officers they were on their way to the airport when he realized he was in the wrong area, and he decided to cut off another driver to make a U-turn at the intersection of Northwest 27th Avenue and Northwest 14th Street.

He told officers the other driver was enraged, stepped on the gas and blocked him at the traffic light, police said. He also said the victim got out of the car, used his hand to pound on the glass and shouted insults. Lyle told officers his 6-year-old son, Mauro, was in the back seat of the car. Lyle is married to Ana Araujo, and they also have a daughter named Arantza.

In response to the hostility, he and Lyle both got out of the car, as well. The driver who was with Lyle said, ""Don't bang on my window,"" and Lyle said he punched the victim once in self-defense because he was scared for his family's safety, police said.

Lyle also told officers he decided to run back to the car and asked the driver to hurry up and leave, after he saw a man running toward them. Lyle claims the single punch was a fearful act of self defense.

Lyle appeared in Miami-Dade County Court on Monday. Prosecutors charged him with battery. He is out on a $5,000 bond. Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Lisa Walsh allowed him to travel to Mexico.

Officers said the victim suffered a fracture to the right side of his skull and internal bleeding during the fall, so he was still intubated and remained unresponsive on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, detectives asked Local 10 News to avoid reporting the identity of the driver who was with Lyle because the incident is still under investigation.

Lyle published a photo with Mauro, Arantza, Araujo, a boy, a baby, and three adults on Instagram with a caption saying, ""What really matters.""

Some Fugitive Friday Bingo videos have been viewed more than others.

Staly's Christmas edition clip has been watched almost 3,000 times.

Staly opened his Christmas edition with the following holiday greeting ""Merry Christmas, fugitive dirt bags!""

The July 4 edition of Fugitive Friday Bingo features Staly in a George Washington costume crossing -- not the Delaware -- but a canal in a rowboat.

""Turn in a dirt bag, get paid, happy July 4th everyone!"" Staly said.

Staly agreed the bingo game is a gimmick, but insisted it's getting results and helping protect the community.

""Overall crime in Flagler County is down 22 percent since 2017. Our violent crime was down 16.3 percent, our property crime was down 24 percent. When (you}) add it all together, it's down 22 percent overall at a time when our community is growing,"" Staly said.

But is the game over the top?

""I've never had anyone tell me that,"" Staly said. ""I've had a lot of people come up to me and tell me they saw it and they loved the Fugitive Friday Bingo.""

Staly said a 7-year-old boy and his mom recently stopped him on his way out of a local Walgreens.

""This young man piped up and said, 'I love that fugitive thing you do on Fridays. I watch it every Friday before I go to school,'"" Staly said. ""It tells me we're reaching from young kids to adults.""

Staly said Wetherhold is also getting recognized regularly from the videos.

Wetherhold said the staff at a motel knew exactly who he was and why he was there -- to arrest a fugitive.

""As soon as I walked in, the people immediately recognized me and asked if we were there for a fugitive apprehension, and they got so excited,"" Wetherhold said. ""I showed them the picture and one of the ladies took me down the hall and I said, 'Hold it, I'm supposed to do that'""

Another time, the fugitive himself recognized Wetherhold.

""I just kinda waved at him and he looks back at me and goes, 'Hey, you're the Fugitive Bingo guy,'"" Wetherhold said. ""He goes, 'I have a warrant?' I go, 'Yes, you do!' He goes, 'Oooooh.'""

Staly said the inspiration for Fugitive Friday Bingo came from Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey's Wheel of Fugitive, which has been featured on national television.

Ivey has since retooled his segment and now calls it ""Fishing for Fugitives.""

984,Gulfshore Opera's 'Traviata' solid musically and dramatically,"Gulfshore Opera's production of ""La Traviata"" was far out on a limb as it could go: First-time Violetta, first-time Germont, first-time stage director.

But it was in such good shape the branch barely swayed. Founder-Artistic Director Steffanie Pearce took the stage director reins with the finesse of a veteran. As she reminded the audience pre-performance, this was her signature role when she was a singer; she's seen enough ""Traviata"" productions to know which movements pull the emotional levers.

She, with associate director Patrick Joel Martin, did just that in the Tuesday performance in Bonita Springs. (There's another Thursday; see the information box.) The details sealed its mood — Violetta swigging from the bottle to fortify her waning dedication to live ""forever in the paths of pleasure,"" the baron holding his challenge glove until the strategic time.

There is virtually no stiff-armed recital posture in this production; it's refreshing and immersive. When you see people dabbing at their eyes in both acts two and four, it's the result of effective stage direction as well as Verdi's powerful music and the stars' performance.

The stars' performance matches that caliber. Maria Valdes, as the traviata, ""the fallen woman,"" not only sings with grace and agility, she has a dramatic grasp of the personality of her wronged heroine: Skeptic of Alfredo's professions of love, stunned by the demands of Alfredo's father that she leave him, ambivalent about the certainty of death and her determination to live for her love.

Her ""Sempre libera"" soars: it's beautifully fluid and precise. She will want some power for larger halls; still, Valdes can put this role on her resume in bold letters.

John Riesen has opera's Emotional Boy, Alfredo, firmly in hand. He is desperately in love and his heart is on his sleeve for the entire opera. Riesen and Valdes partner beautifully, and Riesen is note-perfect and powerful in his solos, an impressive tenor with dramatics to match. He gains power as the performance continues until his icy public confrontation with his lost love at her friend's soirée.

As Giorgio Germont, Alfredo's father, Paul La Rosa is dramatically adept: When he grasps his heart at opera's climax, we're sure he's close to a heart attack. He also has the keen stage presence to know when a line has been dropped and that he needs to repeat his own vocal to set up the scene again, La Rosa did Tuesday in a moment with Riesen. La Rosa's bass-baritone is solid and commanding.

Neill Campbell gets our applause for the chorus, which stars on ""Libiamo,"" the famous drinking song, and in the furious crowd censure of Alfredo after he throws his gambling money at Violetta to ""pay"" her. The orchestra, liberally populated with Southwest Florida Symphony Orchestra musicians, and conductor Greg Ritchey are instrumental Super-glue for the production. (And bows to the Gulfshore Ballet for its gypsy dance during the party scene.)

This is also one of the most elegantly costumed operas we've seen in recent years, although no costume designer is credited on the program.

Quibbles are few, and they're largely to do with technical glitches. Several times, the supertitles got ahead of the characters, showing the baron's lines, for example, while Violetta was singing. And while it's a boon to the company to have one so large as the St. Leo Parish Hall, those sitting near the air handler will get its undercurrent all night. It's the right side facing the stage, so get there early to sit on the left side of your assigned row.

But by all means, get there. Thanks to Gulfshore Opera, this is a thriller even for newcomers, with a story and music that are equally exciting.

985,Testimony underway in murder trial,"Michael Shane Bargo is in court this week in Ocala for a resentencing trial to decide whether he should be put to death for the 2011 murder of 15-year-old Seath Jackson.

Lawyers on Wednesday made opening statements and started examining witnesses in the resentencing trial to decide whether Michael Shane Bargo should be put to death for the 2011 murder of 15-year-old Seath Jackson.

Bargo, along with co-defendants Amber Wright, Kyle Hooper, Charlie Ely and Justin Soto, was convicted of Seath’s murder. The co-defendants were sentenced to life in prison, but Bargo was sentenced to death.

In October 2016, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that juries must unanimously recommend death sentences. Bargo’s jury voted 10-2 for death. In June 2017, the Florida Supreme Court granted Bargo resentencing.

In opening remarks in the Ocala courtroom on Wednesday, Assistant State Attorney Amy Berndt gave the jury an outline of times, sequences, the people involved, and efforts that went into the planning and subsequent murder of Seath.

Berndt said Bargo shot and beat the boy, whose body was placed in a sleeping bag and then was put into a burn pit. Seath's remains later were placed in three buckets and were dumped into a rock quarry.

""The murder was cold, calculated and premeditated,"" Berndt said while facing the jury.

Candance Hawthorne, one of the lawyers defending Bargo, now age 26, painted a sympathetic picture of her client. She talked about his rough childhood and mental illness diagnosis. She said he was a loving brother, son and grandson who cared deeply for his grandmother.

Hawthorne told the jury members that they will hear what she calls ""different stories"" about what happened. She said at one point, while at the Marion County Sheriff's Office, the others who were involved in the teen's death decided to pin the murder on her client. She said they did not know they were being recorded by law enforcement officials.

In closing, Hawthorne said that when all the evidence is presented, the jury should give Bargo life in prison without parole.

Robin Arnold, an assistant state attorney, and Brenda Smith from the defense team, took turns questioning several people called to the witness stand. Among those who testified was Tracey Wright, the mother of siblings Kyle Hooper and Amber Wright. Tracey Wright was the person who called a sheriff's deputy so her children and others could talk about Seath.

Seath's mother, Sonia Jackson, testified about hearing Bargo threaten her son's life.

William Samalot, described as Seath's best friend, admitted losing his temper when he saw Bargo, who, he said, did not show any remorse. Samalot said he did not hit Bargo but he possibly did threaten him.

James Havens, who pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact for helping the teenagers dispose of Seath's remains, testified that he was dating Tracey Wright at the time of Seath's death. He said he was at the house when Bargo talked about killing the boy. He said he left because he was nervous.

He said Bargo called and told him ""the deed is done."" He said he went back to sleep. Hawthorne asked Havens why he did not call authorities or Tracey Wright.

Bargo told the judge that he did not call Havens and wanted to know why his defense team has not been given phone records to prove this.

986,2 teens electrocuted trying to save dog in canal,"Advertisement 2 teens electrocuted trying to save dog in canal Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Two teenagers trying to rescue a dog from a canal died Monday when they grabbed hold of an electrically charged metal bridge, the Solano County Sheriff’s Office said.Three teenage boys, a teenage girl and a dog were walking alongside a Solano Irrigation District canal west of Interstate 80 in Dixon around 12:30 p.m. when, at some point, two of the teens and the dog walked across the bridge, which goes over the canal. “For unknown reasons, the dog jumped or fell from the bridge into the SID canal,” a news release from the sheriff’s office said. Two of the boys — identified by officials as 17-year-old Jacob Hourmouzus of Elk Grove and 17-year-old Jacob Schneider of Dixon — jumped into the canal to try to save the dog. As they grabbed the dog, the teens reached up to the metal bridge to try to keep from being pulled farther down the canal. “When doing so, witness reports state the two teenage boys appeared to have been electrocuted and unable to release their grip from the metal bridge,” the sheriff’s office said. The third teenage boy saw what was happening and jumped into the canal, which knocked the two other teens off the bridge. He was able to pull the two teens from the canal and onto the side of the levee. The teenage girl then called 911. Firefighters quickly arrived at the canal and started lifesaving efforts on the two boys. Both were rushed to a hospital in Vacaville, where they were pronounced dead. A Pacific Gas and Electric Co. crew went to the scene to deactivate power to the energized bridge so that it would be safe for investigators. Investigators with the sheriff’s office and the Solano County District Attorney’s Office are looking into the case and “will work with experts to determine how the bridge became energized and this incident occurred,” the release said. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of everyone affected by this tragedy,” Solano County Sheriff Thomas Ferrara said in a statement. “The Solano County Sheriff’s Office will continue to search for answers as to how this incident happened.”The dog, named Ranger, was treated for its injuries, released to its family and was reportedly in good health as of Tuesday morning, officials said.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/teens-killed-trying-to-save-dog-solano-county/27024689,2019-04-03T04:16:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

SPRING HILL, Fla. (WFLA) - A pregnant Spring Hill woman is pleading for the woman who rear-ended her to step forward.

Jaidyn Martinez is bruised and banged up after the crash.

It happened around noon Monday, at the busy intersection near Mariner Boulevard and Landover, not far from Springstead High School.

“I could have lost my child or ya know, myself,” said Martinez.

Eight months pregnant, stopped in heavy rain at a light, Martinez recalls a few horrifying moments.

“I’m looking in my rearview mirror and I just see this, there's nothing I could do,” she said.

In her mother's Toyota Corolla, she braced for impact.

“She's coming way too fast. She's doing about 40-50 still. And then she just smacked right into the back of me,” said Martinez.

At first, it appeared the at-fault driver was going to do the right thing.

“She opened my door and unbuckled, she was trying to unbuckle my seat belt. She did successfully do it, but the seat belt locked and it was pulling on my stomach. It was making me very uncomfortable,” said Martinez

She thinks she blacked out for moment. She called 911, worried about her unborn baby boy.

“She stopped and she ran back like she was coming to help me. And she's like 'you're okay, you're okay.' I was like, 'no I'm not okay,'” she said.

The driver of the white, newer Mercedes didn't stick around.

“She's in the left lane but she swerves all the way to the right. She cuts off all of these cars and I was just in utter shock,” Martinez explained.

The crash sent her to Spring Hill Regional Hospital.

Her mother's car still bears an imprint of the Mercedes logo in the rear bumper.

That driver could face a felony charge of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries. Martinez hopes she turns herself in.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/hit-and-run-crash-injures-pregnant-spring-hill-woman/1895991435,2019-04-03T02:17:55Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
988,Hollywood neighbors say free-roaming dogs may have also attacked cat,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. - Two pit bull terriers that were caught on camera attacking a small dog in Hollywood this weekend are also suspected of brutally mauling a neighbor's cat.

Neighbors in the area of North 11th Court and Grant Street say the large dogs often roam free without a leash, chasing people and frightening others.

Steven Onyshchenko said this mother found the family's cat, Irma, with a large puncture wound, lying nearly dead in the bushes about a week ago.

""She was, like, meowing and crying out,"" Onyshchenko said.

Onyshchenko's mother said she had seen the dogs roaming free around the time that Irma was attacked. The cat is expected to recover, Onyshchenko said.

On Sunday, Mark Modzelewski's teenage son was walking their dog, Cutie, when the pit bull terriers attacked. The boy tried to pull Cutie to safety but the dogs kept lunging at the Yorkshire terrier.

Eventually, a City Furniture truck passed by and the workers inside pulled Cutie into the cab to safety.

The dog suffered bites to her eye, chin and feet.

The dogs' owner, Gary Biernacki, denied his pit bull terriers are ever loose and denied having personal problems with his neighbors. Officials with Broward Animal Care and the Hollywood police officers contacted Biernacki Tuesday and told him he is to appear before a judge about the incidents. He could be cited and his dogs could be deemed ""dangerous.""

For now, Biernacki has been ordered to keep the dogs muzzled. The dogs could be removed if they are caught roaming free again.

Residents told Local 10's Andrew Perez that all they want at this point is peace of mind.

""It's become kind of a prison right now with him on the end of the block,"" Sandy Osterman said.

TAMPA (WFLA) - A Florida couple said I do country style at Redneck Mud Park in what might be the most redneck wedding ever.

Jeremy Biddle and Ahrielle Biddle decided they did not want an ordinary wedding so they decided to have the ceremony during the Trucks Gone Wild event at the park.

Jeremy tells WFLA that they wanted the ceremony to be as fun as possible so they got married in the back of their friend's pickup truck and the bride even wore an all white bikini as opposed to your average wedding dress.

The backroad romance even included a dip in the mud after the couple said I do.

Jeremy tells us that their love is ""country boy love"" and he couldn't be happier.

992,Mom charged after toddler swallows drugs,"- A mother is charged with child neglect after police said her two-year-old son swallowed her drugs and nearly died.

Investigators said Jacqueline Donnelly admitted to bringing the drugs into the home and not keeping them out of the child’s reach. Narcan, a medication used to block the effects of opioids, was used to save the child’s life, authorities said.

“It’s going to be a two-year-old turning blue, eyes rolled back in his head,” a dispatcher is heard saying in a 911 call, relaying information to the ambulance crew as seconds counted.

Police said on Sunday night Donnelly called 911 from her home on Arthur Drive. Her little one was experiencing a medical emergency. When the child arrived at the hospital, doctors determined he had ingested methadone.

Donnelly is now charged with child neglect without great bodily harm. At her bond hearing, a judge said that, given her history, he would follow the state’s recommendation and set her bond at $25,000. He also ordered no contact with the child.

According to CNN, a Bangladeshi woman identified as Arifa Sultana had twins 26 days after she gave birth to her first child at Ad-Din Hospital in Dhaka.

Sultana has uterus didelphys, a condition meaning she has two uteruses.

Her first baby and her set of twins were conceived and grown in separate uteruses. Doctors say she did not get an ultrasound before the first delivery, so it was missed.

Doctors were able to perform a C-section to safely deliver the twins, a girl, and a boy.

One teen boy was killed and another person suffered non-life-threatening wounds after an arranged meet-up in Lehigh Acres for the possible purchase of a ""tactical vest"" Saturday evening ended with gunplay.

The dead male was identified Sunday afternoon as J’Martin Hixon, 14. Two other teens were also arrested in connection with the shooting and face multiple charges including homicide and conspiracy for robbery.

The Lee County Sheriff's Office is actively investigating the shooting that happened shortly after 7 p.m. at the intersection of Cedartree Avenue and Centennial Boulevard south of Buckingham Road.

Upon arrival, deputies located an adult male victim suffering from a non-life threatening gunshot wound. He was transported to a local hospital.

During the investigation, Sheriff's Office Major Crimes Unit detectives learned that the victim had arranged to meet the buyer of an item he had posted on the online site ""Let Go.""

A sheriff's office spokesman said the item being sold was a ""tactical vest"" although specifics of what kind of tactical vest were not available Sunday. Such vests can range from being bulletproof to simple equipment carriers and cost from $15 to hundreds of dollars.

The sale of such vests are not illegal by and/or to private citizens, a sheriff's office spokesman said. However, Sgt. Alan Canfield did note that such online sales should be made in a secure and safe location.

The victim made contact with two males and during the exchange, detectives said, one of the males brandished a firearm and shot the victim. The victim then returned fire, striking one.

Two other suspects, Lamartine Malbranche, 15, and Jerry Murassaint, 16, were arrested. Both were charged with conspiracy to commit robbery, robbery with firearm and murder while engaged in certain felony offense. Murassaint was also charged with tampering or destroying evidence.

Both remain in the Lee County juvenile detention center with no bond and an April 15 arraignment.

The child was mauled, suffering injuries to his head, neck, and arms.

Neighbors say they're aware cougars are in the area, but encounters like this are shocking.

""It's very horrible to hear that a child attacked like that. We hadn't heard any warnings from our dogs in the past few days so it's kind of a surprise."" Neighbor Jeff Bain said.

Authorities found two cougars still on the property and they were both euthanized.

""From the first look, they're quite thin. They're young cats, not looking like they're doing very well,” said Sgt. Scott Norris with the British Columbia Conservation Officer Service. ""Cats that are not very well-fed are the ones who are going to take chances and do things they shouldn't necessarily be doing.""

Officers swept the area with their hounds in case there was a third animal, but no other cougars were detected.

1007,"Letters to the editor for NDN Wednesday, April 3, 2019","Affordable housing in SWFL

As you noted, property taxes and Insurance make up the total cost of housing. Collier County has one of the highest median property tax rates in the U.S. requiring close to 4 percent of a median family’s income.

Add the cost for home insurance (recently increased by 33 percent due to Irma), the cost for flood insurance and no wonder housing in Collier is so unaffordable.

Marco's police problems

We see what is going on politically in Washington, D.C., and Chicago and say how sad that the elected or appointed officials act in a manor that is unacceptable to the will of the citizens. It was said of Chicago, ""Big city with small-town politics.""

Well, we here on Marco Island are an example of the ""small-town politics"" the Chicago commentator spoke of. On Jan. 8, the Marco Island City Council's newly appointed Interim city manager, Mr, David Harden, assumed his duties. In a matter of days, Mr. Harden requested Marco's police chief, Al Schettino, to resign. Either Mr. Harden has an amazing ability to evaluate employee performance or he was given a predetermined agenda by members of the City Council on the Q.T. The chief, it is said, has initiated actions that would lead to his retirement, given the alternative.

The chief assumed the position with issues that had been lingering over several of his predecessors' terms. All of these issues have been addressed and corrected or are in the procedural process.

Because of Chief Schettino's leadership, he has the support of many in his own department, as well as members within the Police Foundation.

I, along with many other Marco residents, want to keep the chief on the job. Marco Island needs a continuation of the progress Chief Schettino has brought to our Police Department and our community. It is time all Marco Island residents become informed and involved with their City Council government and stop the ""small-town politics.""

Against road extension

We are proud to support and contribute our time and effort assisting an exemplary group of local residents who decided to take a stance against Collier County’s Whippoorwill Lane and Marbella Lakes Drive connection project, which is coming up for a vote Tuesday.

The group’s grassroots accomplishments include the NoRoadExtension.com website that highlights the viewpoints of residents opposed to the project and contains images of the nature it will destroy. To date, that website has over 1,500 visitors, supplemented by a petition with over 525 signatures opposing the project.



The group’s opposition, including retorts to nonsensical claims that have been made in favor of this project, will be presented at Tuesday's meeting of commissioners. Residents are encouraged to attend to hear this group’s side of the story, a story that all too often unfolds in other Collier County neighborhoods due to continued, unwanted over-development. We’re told it’s in the name of progress. It is not, it is against conservation, and often destructive to our neighborhoods.



The group's emergence, organization and passionate stance in opposition to the road connection project was accomplished in a mere few weeks. Political campaigns are run over an extended period of time. Citizens will not forget how our representatives vote for this project.

Rest assured that with more time to prepare, the group will resurface even stronger community-wide, in favor of representatives who stand with the overwhelming majority of their constituents on the issues, over any other extenuating factors. For those representatives who don’t, rest assured that the group’s growing ranks in opposition will be heard loud and clear.

Health care costs

If the president is to believed, the United States has the best health care facilities in the world. Unfortunately, in terms of accessibility, we are dead last.

The wealthy and those of us who have a decent health care plan reap the benefits of a system in which there is an abundance of support for almost any illness.

It is astounding that the richest country in the world ignores the plight of the poor, the elderly and many middle-class families who simply cant afford to pay.

""Obamacare"" is certainly not perfect, but there was hope that it would be improved over time, and those citizens who enrolled were relieved to have some basic health care.

Mr. Trump's goal, of course, is to destroy anything Obama created, to which end he tirelessly pursues abolishing ""Obamacare.""

His idea of making America great again is to give tax cuts to the rich. Those who support his policies that put the poor and elderly sick at risk ought to re-examine their priorities.

Marine Rose Program

The Marine Corps League of Naples wants to express our thanks to Oaks Farms Market, Sunshine Ace Hardware and their customers for supporting the Marine Rose Program fundraising event at their facilities Saturday.

In 1778, during the War of Independence, The Marine Corps ROSE was dedicated to Marines who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. This tradition was continued by the French during World War I after Marines attacked the Germans in the trenches at Belleau Wood. Roses were planted by the grateful French people at the graves of the fallen Marines.

The Marine Corps League Rose Program was started by Marine Eddie Gallagher, of New York. It was designed to parallel the VFW “Poppy” Program to provide money for Detachments to assist Veterans, Marines Helping Marines, provide scholarships and assist in youth programs, including the Boy Scouts of America Eagle Scout Courts of Honor, and Collier County alternative schools' New Beginnings program.

Collusion with Russia?

The 300-page Mueller report on the co-called collusion was condensed to a four-page summary by the U.S. attorney general prior to the release of a more detailed version or the report.

The entire hoax can be summarized in one brief sentence: It is extremely difficult to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if there is no cat.

West Boca Medical Center hosted a call of the quarter to honor Palm Beach County Rescue Station 55 for their live saving efforts.

According to the medical center, the station responded to a call about a 15 year old suffering from an asthma attack last November. When they showed up on the scene, the family was trying to give their son CPR.

Firefighters quickly put the teen on a stretcher and gave him a bag mask ventilator to help with his breathing. They took him to the hospital, where the assistant nurse manager credited the firefighters' treatment with saving the teen's life.

The teen thankfully recovered and was released from the hospital.

Officials have called off the search for a California father who dove into the San Joaquin River trying to save his son, according to crews.The family of Moua Lo, 41, is looking for his body on their own. “The family is really hurt,” said Chong Yang, Lo’s brother-in-law. “We’re not giving up.”Lo’s family stood along the banks of the river Saturday and lit candles.Surrounded by loved ones, Lo’s oldest daughter wiped away tears. She called 911 for help as her father struggled in the water.“Right now, we’re hoping people out there will still pray for us and pray for our family,” Yang said.The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department said Lo’s boat hit a wave while he and his three children were fishing Friday near Isleton. His boy, Marcus, fell into the water. His father dove in after him.Crews were able to rescue Lo’s two daughters from the boat and pull Marcus from the water.All three had life jackets. Their dad did not, and first responders were unable to find him. The children’s mother wasn’t with them when the incident happened.Yang said his sister was forced to make an impossible decision: search the river for her husband or rush to the hospital to be with her son.“Knowing that Marcus was struggling, she had to make the decision to go there because he is up there in the hospital,” Yang said.The child is in critical condition and breathing on a respirator, according to family.Family and friends remembered Lo as someone who loved being on the water.“He loves the outdoors,” Yang said. “He loves fishing.”But more than anything, he loved his family.“He will sacrifice himself, and I know that that’s why he went over without even thinking twice,” Yang said.After more than a day of scouring the river, crews called off the search, leaving Lo’s family asking for more help.“I’m pleading for all the rescue efforts to continue,” Yang said. “I hope that they will continue to put the efforts out there until we find him.”Yang said family members are continuing to use their own boats to search the water.

“Mom, I’m going to college.” – Amadou Diallo, 23

“I don’t have a gun. Stop shooting.” – Michael Brown, 18

“It’s not real.” – John Crawford, 22

“I can’t breathe.” – Eric Garner, 43

Those were the last words of six unarmed black men and one unarmed black boy killed in America.

Joel Thompson, a composer from Atlanta, strung those words together into a composition titled, ""Seven Last Words of the Unarmed.""

The Tallahassee Symphony Orchestra, the Morehouse College Glee Club and the Florida A&M Concert Choir performed the piece together before a full house at Ruby Diamond Concert Hall Sunday afternoon. The event was sponsored by Leon County, TSO and Village Square.

Tears were shed by audience members and those in the ensemble during the powerful performance.

Two other pieces were also performed: ""Lyrics of Strings"" and ""I Am the Voice.""

Thompson talked about what inspired him to create his work. He spoke of the sadness he felt after watching a video of the death of Eric Garner on YouTube.

""It was an attempt to explore my own grief in a way that I could then move on from it,"" Thompson said.

He emphasized his intentions were not to be anti-police, something the TSO board had grappled with while deciding whether to stage the event, which was discussed by Greene and Slevin.

""This piece is not an anti-police protest work; it is really a meditation on the lives of these black men and an effort to focus on their humanity, which is often eradicated in the media to justify their deaths,"" he said in his message from the composer found in the event's program.

Thompson applauded Amanda Stringer, CEO of TSO for the event.

""Dr. Stringer saw the piece and in a stroke of fearless leadership decided to program this piece in an effort to use music as a way to build community.""

The second half of the event was a performance of ""Symphony No. 9"" by Beethoven.

1015,Bus driver hailed as hero after saving child from road,"JACKSONVILLE - George Brooks has been a Jacksonville Transportation Authority driver for over six years, but he never imagined one day he would have to save a child from danger on his route.

“I was driving down Commonwealth and Superior, and I seen a little baby about 2 or 3 years old standing in the middle of the (road),” Brooks said.

Brooks couldn’t believe that the child was outside alone.

“As I approached, the baby was standing there by himself looking at me like, ‘I’m not going to move. I’m not coming out.’ It shocked me at first, and I know kids be out playing. It shocked me and I was scared and I was frightened.""

Despite being shocked and frightened, Brooks took action as cars were about to pass by the little boy.

“I just stopped the bus and jumped out of my seat and ran and grabbed the little baby,” he said. “There were cars passing by, and right as I grabbed the little baby, a car came down the street really fast so it would’ve been a disaster.”

Despite his quick thinking to save a child’s life, he insists he’s not a hero.

“I’m not a hero,” he said. “I’m just here to do what God wants me to do, and I’m just his servant and do what he asked me to do.”

The child’s parents have not been identified.

On Monday, somebody stole it off the porch of his home in Lake Wales, Florida.

""I thought, 'Who would take my bike?'"" Daylin said in an interview with WFTS-TV in Tampa.

His mom said the bike, with its ""Daylin strong"" stickers on the side, had a lot of sentimental value.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office decided to do something to cheer the boy up, while officers looked for the bicycle thief.

Sheriff Grady Judd and some of his officers went to Daylin's house to bring him a brand-new bike, a helmet and lock.

Daylin thanked the men and smiled quietly while they worked to make sure the bicycle helmet fit.

He answered with a polite ""yes sir,"" when the sheriff asked him if he was feeling well and taking care of himself.

Daylin was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in May, WFTS reported, and was hospitalized a number of times between May and December while undergoing chemotherapy.

""I thought I wasn't going to make it,"" Daylin told the TV station.

This type of cancer causes bone marrow to make abnormal versions of white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets, which are responsible for blood clotting.

In a Facebook post, the Sheriff's Office said that Daylin is now in remission.

""We hope this bike will help him enjoy being a kid again,"" the posting said.

OMAHA, Ne. (WOI) - Most grandmothers have a special bond with their grandchildren, but one grandmother from Gretna, NE has an even greater bond. She carried the baby for nine months as a surrogate for her son and his husband.

61-year-old Cecile Eledge delivered five pounds,13-ounce Uma Louise Dougherty-Eledge on Monday, March 25.

When her son Matthew and his husband Elliot Dougherty wanted to expand their family, she volunteered. “There was no moment of hesitation. It was natural instinct.” Cecile Eledge said.

With her age in consideration, Cecile undertook several medical tests before doctors determined her health allowed her to be the surrogate. Dougherty's sister donated the egg and Matthew donated the sperm.

“We are thankful with how the whole process worked,” said Matthew Eledge. “We are really grateful that both Uma and her grandma are here, happy and healthy. For the time being, we’re just going to relax and enjoy this moment.”",https://www.wfla.com/national/61-year-old-grandma-delivers-healthy-baby-girl-for-her-son-and-his-husband/1889748277,2019-03-31T11:16:37Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1019,"Texas boy missing since 2017 found in Sanford, police say","SANFORD, Fla. - A child missing from Texas since 2017 was found Saturday morning in Sanford.



Sanford police officers were investigating a suspicious vehicle near Seminole Boulevard and San Juan Avenue Saturday morning when they said they found 9-year-old Joshua Graham with Kenneth Graham, 52.

According to police, Kenneth, a noncustodial parent, left Texas with Joshua at the end of 2017 without notifying his wife, who was granted sole custody of him in February 2018. It was assumed that Kenneth was going to take Joshua to Tallahassee, where he had lived before.

Texas law enforcement in Houston filed Joshua missing this month with the status of ""abducted by a non-custodial parent.""

''Regardless of the circumstances, the feelings of loss and devastation are indescribable when any child is taken from a parent. The officers and investigators involved in this case are delighted to have played a significant role in reuniting this mother with her child after two long years. I am proud that the officers responding to this call quickly identified that something didn't seem right, and those instincts led to this happy conclusion,"" Chief Cecil Smith said.

According to police, Joshua Graham is in the custody of Child Protective Services while he waits to be reunited with his mother. Officials say the state of Texas may file criminal charges at a later date.

Investigators are asking anyone with information to contact Sanford Police Department or Crimeline by calling 800 423-TIPS (8477) or visit www.crimeline.org.

1031,"Masters of wine: 3 Master Sommeliers share cheap favorites, fast-food pairings and more","CLOSE Do you ever love a wine so much, you wish you could just live inside the bottle? Time

Which wine goes well with a McDonald's burger? There are fewer than 300 Master Sommeliers in the world. We asked three of them to share their secrets.

Years ago, George Miliotes was on his way to work when he happened to see Tiger Woods — at that time one of Orlando's most famous residents — striking balls out on the golf course. It was about 9 a.m.

""Now I happened to get off work a little early that day,"" he recalls, ""and I was driving home around 5 or 6 o'clock. It was raining, a real Florida downpour, and there he was, still at it, hitting balls out of a sand trap in the pouring rain. One after the other.""

Miliotes, whose eponymous Wine Bar George opened at Disney Springs last year to rave reviews, thinks for a moment.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

""Why? Because at some point in time in his career, he would have to hit a sand shot when it had been raining. And that's why he's out there practicing. Whether it's Tiger Woods, or any other golfer at the top of their game, they all have to do it, they all want to have every single shot in the game down — so even when it looks like they're winging it, they aren't.""

George Miliotes, one of only 300 or so Master Sommeliers in the world, cut his hospitality teeth while working in his father's restaurants. He could decipher a German wine label by the time he was 16 years old. (Photo: Ine Quinn Photography)

Miliotes says there's no difference between Woods' devotion to craft and that which helps make a Master Sommelier, a designation less than 300 people worldwide have achieved since the first examination in 1969.

Only those who pass the Advanced Sommelier Exam (25-30 percent, per the Court of Master Sommeliers) may apply to take the MS, where the pass rate drops dramatically. Only 10 percent make it through the theory portion. Some make multiple attempts, spending thousands in their pursuit.

The regions. The subregions. The districts. The soils. The varietals.

Master Sommeliers must know it all, from food pairings and wine laws to storage specifics and distillation methods. The exam's three sections — theory, practical restaurant wine service and salesmanship, and practical tasting — are the gateway to greatness in the field of oenophilia.

A 2014 poll by the Guild of Sommeliers placed the average salary for a Master Sommelier at $150,000; the next highest certification, Advanced Sommelier, garners $78,000. This diploma, and the gold pin that comes with it, are the wine world's ultimate credentials.

For Brian Koziol, whose love of science, geography and history collided with wine while in a college hospitality program, the path to the Master Sommelier designation was a 10-year journey, four for the first three designations, six for the final. Koziol, Food & Beverage Concept & Development Director for Walt Disney World Parks & Resorts, remembers the moment he began to think it could be attainable.

""When you taste your first wine in a blind setting and you get it correct, you get this mojo in you,"" he laughs. ""Especially if it's something rarer than a classic chardonnay or cabernet.""

Wine Bar George, a 210-seat wine bar reminiscent of a winemaker's home estate, is at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World Resort. Opened in spring 2018, Master Sommelier George Miliotes brings his expertise to the eponymous bar which features wines from famed growing regions in the U.S. and abroad. (Photo: Disney)

Miliotes took a decade to earn his as well, including a two-year hiatus from study to open Darden Restaurants' Seasons 52 concept. He went at it like a golf pro, with two shoeboxes full of question cards that took five hours to go through, every day, in preparation.

""They practice every single shot they could ever hit,"" he says. ""You taste every single wine that could be on the test. You have to have that game.""

We asked three of these wine masters to share their wealth of knowledge, not just on expensive wonders, but on everyday wines, deliciously cheap wines, and their guilty pleasures.

Red: Triton tempranillo. ""It's from the Toro region of Spain...where you have 60- to 80-year-old vines, all sandy soils, all head-trained – so they're low-yielding – and it just makes for as delicious a red wine as there is in the world today, both for power and smoothness.""

White: Pewsey Vale riesling. ""Pewsey Vale is a winery in Australia...It's a crisp, dry Riesling. It's linear. I just love it. It can go with so many different things.""

Cheap date (bottles for under $13): Excelsior chardonnay. ""It is from South Africa and is as fine a wine as is made today – 100 percent chardonnay from a growing area called Robertson, which has limestone soils – that's chardonnay's favorite soil to grow in.""

Guilty pairing: ""A McDonald's double cheeseburger, no onions, a small fry and a good red wine are pretty darn yummy.""

Tips for wine at home: ""Red wines need to be in the 60s, temperature-wise. If it's sitting on your counter and your house is 72 degrees, put it in the fridge for 15 minutes before you drink; it will taste better. Flip side for whites. If they're sitting in your fridge at 38 degrees, take them out for 15 minutes before you serve them – because in the 50s is where they will show their full flavor.""

Master Sommelier myth he'll dispel: That they only drink expensive wines. ""It's absolutely not true! Here's the thing: $200, $500, $2,000 bottles? They'd better be good, right? Those are the easy ones! My trade is finding those things that show brilliant value at every price point. I enjoy all types of wine and all types of wine have different uses for the guests and for me. I taste everything, and we drink everything in my house.""

About John: Vice President, The Spire Collection (a luxury portfolio for Jackson Family Wines) and Master Sommelier since 2004

Favorite food/wine combination: Margherita pizza with a California sauvignon blanc. ""If I have a salad comprised of heirloom tomatoes drizzled with EVOO, fresh herbs and a slice of burrata or bufala mozzarella, I am reaching for all the nuances of the sauvignon blanc varietal ...The salad is nothing more than the deconstruction of the pizza, simplistic in general terms.""

Cheap date: ""Carmel Road unoaked chardonnay or Murphy Goode pinot noir. Both over-deliver at that price point.""

Guilty pairing: ""Chick-fil-A sandwich with a glass of California chardonnay — try it!""

Tips for wine at home: ""Refrigerate your open bottles of red; it slows down oxidation. Invest in quality glassware. Research the shape of the glass to proper varietal expression; it makes all the difference.""

White: ""I've been enjoying German riesling: Robert Weil riesling trocken, Rheingau or Selbach-Oster Bernkasteler Badstube riesling spätlese, Mosel.""

Best food/wine pairing: ""Oh, man, some truffled risotto with some Barolo (an Italian red) would be delicious right now. But I am a Chicago boy of Polish ancestry, so I love sausages, any kind of sausages. And sausage goes great with riesling. And if you like spicier grape varietals, you'd probably enjoy something a little jammy and juicy, like malbec.""

Cheap date: ""New Zealand's sauvignon blanc is still delivering good quality for the dollar. The brightness of the fruit, the crispness, really lends itself to hot weather; it's great in the afternoon and you could pair it with any seafood you want! You can still find decent quality malbec from Argentina. From the United States, I think the best value for your money are the reds coming out of Washington state.""

1032,Tuesday is World Autism Awareness Day,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

CHESAPEAKE, Va. - Around one in every 59 kids will be diagnosed with autism this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

A diagnosis is four times more likely for boys than girls.

The National Institute of Mental Health defines Autism Spectrum Disorder as a developmental disorder that affects behavior and communication. The severity of symptoms varies greatly from person to person.

Each year on April 2, World Autism Awareness Day is an effort to not only speak out against the discrimination of people with autism, but also recognize the potential of people living with it.

Ashton McCormick of Chesapeake, Virginia, was diagnosed with autism as a young boy. His case was considered severe and non-verbal, his mom Jennifer says.

McCormick and his racing partner qualified to run the Boston Marathon, in 2017.

Their situation was a unique one; Davis, who's blind, pushed McCormick in a racing chair. It's a setup non-profits like Ainsley's Angels use to help people with disabilities participate in races.

The two ran in Boston in 2018, making history as the first team featuring a blind runner and a disabled athlete to finish the race.

In all, McCormick has participated in nearly 160 races, his parents say. Now, what the McCormicks saw as a way to socialize their son has helped him beyond what they expected.

“It’s exposed him to new people, it’s exposed him to new experiences,"" said Jennifer McCormick. ""Him sitting here (and doing an interview) is not something he would’ve been able to do a few years ago. He would’ve been up pacing.""

Although McCormick's autism still impacts his everyday life and communication, he does talk and he enjoys being around people.

He recently participated in the Shamrock Marathon in Virginia Beach for the third time, running with a different partner, Jonathan Gajewski, a 20-year-old Virginia Beach native.

“He has autism but that doesn’t make a difference. He’s just like everybody else to me, but he’s definitely a brother and that keeps us closer,"" said Gajewski of the relationship he has with McCormick.

The two are currently raising money for a run in the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington D.C. later this year.

His mom says the possibilities for her son are endless.

""I used to put limitations on what I thought he could do, but I don't. There's no telling,"" she said.

“The Hall family was so welcoming and inviting,"" Collins said. ""It’s tough finding people who allow us to be a part of their lives for several months. My photographer and I became friends with them and were there at their baby shower, at the NICU after Grayson was born and were even invited into their home.



“At first, the story was going to be a quick profile to run before the baby was born in December. But I sensed a bigger story and in order to tell it fully, we needed to follow them before and after the birth to give readers an opportunity to experience what it’s like to be a new mom at 50. And they said sure!



“It was such a humbling experience. And one that shows how important it is to build trust in the community.”

Utah authorities said the owners of a dog that bit off a 4-year-old boy’s hand have agreed to surrender their two huskies, which will live out their days with an animal rescue group.Animal control officials said Wednesday that they dropped citations against the owners in exchange for their agreement to give up both their huskies, since it was unclear which animal bit the boy.Authorities have said the child lived next door to the dogs in Layton, and was bitten March 3. The boy stuck his sock-covered arm in a gap between the ground and a solid vinyl fence in his backyard.The boy lost an entire hand and part of his arm. The hand was never found and is believed to have been ingested by the dog.At the time, Rhett Nicks, the director of Davis County Animal Care and Control, told ABC 4 it was possible the huskies, named Polar and Bear, could be put down.""There's a severe injury to a human,"" Nicks said. ""So, we are doing a dangerous dog investigation, which could range from nothing being done up to and including euthanasia.""Officials have said it was the animal's first reported bite. Jessica Nusz, a friend of the dogs' owner, said the owner relies on the dogs for support and called the incident a ""freak accident.""""Bear, who was playing with what he thought was a toy, bit down too hard and didn't see that there was a child on the other side of the fence.

1043,"Actor Bailey Chase of 'Longmire,' 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' 'Ugly Betty' grew up in Florida","Actor and Naples native Bailey Chase co-stars in a new Netflix Original movie, ""Walk Ride Rodeo."" (Photo: Photo courtesy of Greg Peters)

Bailey Chase for years has played the character viewers often dislike.

The Naples native and father of three says he's enjoying his new roles including the new Netflix Original ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" that premiered earlier this month.

Chase, 46, gained prominence for his acting from 2012 to 2017 on the western crime series ""Longmire,"" in which he played the role of an ambitious Wyoming sheriff's deputy, Branch Connally.

“More than anything, the arc that I got to do on 'Longmire,' that character Branch, he hit all the notes,"" Chase said in a recent telephone interview.

""It gave me a confidence as an actor that I could do anything, I could play good. I could play bad. And by portraying these newer characters, that’s how I connect with the audience more. Then they start rooting for you.”

In his latest role, Chase plays Cory Snyder, the real-life father of Amberley Snyder, a successful rodeo barrel racer who returns to the sport after a car crash.

Bailey and his wife Amy have three children: twin 2-year-olds (a boy and a girl) and a 4-year-old daughter who was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Chase was still shooting ""Longmire.""

“For me as a dad, to play that role, as an actor, you go to those places where I’m imagining my girl in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair,"" Bailey said.

“Since 'Longmire' and becoming a dad, I feel like I can play anything.”

He grew up in Naples, living in the seaside town from age 4 through his freshman year at Naples High School. He transferred to the Bolles School in Jacksonville where he played football and baseball and graduated from the private school before heading to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

After graduating from Duke with a bachelor's degree in sports psychology, Chase said, he decided to fulfill ""a boyhood dream"" and headed to Los Angeles instead of New York.

""I came out here, being a Florida boy,"" Chase said. ""The climate was a little bit better. I was living at the beach, waiting tables and going to acting class.”

He eventually traveled overseas to become a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), to study Shakespeare.

When he returned to the U.S., he landed a role on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" a television series that ran from 1997 to 2003. For the next few years, Chase portrayed Chris Robert Hughes on the soap opera ""As The World Turns.""

He co-starred as ""Becks"" Scott in the ABC comedy-drama ""Ugly Betty,"" which ran from 2006 to 2010, and on the TNT series ""Saving Grace"" that was ran between 2007 and 2010.

But his most notable role came in 2012, when he began on ""Longmire"" that began on the A&E channel and, later, Netflix. Actor Robert Taylor starred as Walt Longmire, a stoic, rugged, no-nonsense sheriff who revealed his Australian accent away from the camera, Chase said.

""He’s a good dude,"" Chase said of Taylor. ""It was a strong cast. We were all distinctly different.”

Longmire"" also co-starred actress Kate Sackhoff and actors Lou Diamond Phillips and Gerald McRaney, known for his TV roles on ""Major Dad"" and ""Simon & Simon"" that Chase said he grew up watching.

Upcoming work for Chase include a role this summer on season 4 of ""Queen of the South,"" a crime drama on the USA Network. Chase said he's been flying to New Orleans for filming and returning home to LA every weekend.

All he said he could reveal about his character is that he's ""a jazz musician with a dark past.""

Chase said he still has family in Florida, including a brother who's a builder based in Ocala. He hasn't been in Naples for more than a decade but hopes to visit again one day.

“Growing up down there, I couldn’t wait to get out,"" he said of Naples.

""But once I got into my 20s and my 30s, I always enjoyed coming back home. Naples will always be home. It's so humid; it just has a feel and a smell. It’s very nostalgic for me.”

1046,Florida Men Locked in Bitter Feud to Be Trump's Best Boy,"Photo: AP

The Democrats might be a mess, but for petty drama look no further than the Matt Gaetz-Rick Scott feud, filled with deceit, betrayal, and two racist idiots.

The battle for Top Florida Man, which made news last month amid Scott’s other feud with his successor Gov. Rick DeSantis, bubbled to another boil last week when Scott decried Gaetz’s tweet appearing to threaten Michael Cohen before the former Trump lawyer’s testimony to Congress, according to Politico.

Scott called Gaetz’s actions “wrong” and “disgusting,” getting his shots in amid a Florida Bar investigation into Gaetz’s Cohen tweet and re-energizing a feud that began years before Gaetz was elected to Congress, when Scott lobbied against Gaetz’s father Don, former president of the Florida Senate, getting the top job at the University of West Florida.

And now the two Floridians are duking it out for Donald Trump’s affections and attention, with Politico reporting Monday night on a blow-out on Air Force One last summer (emphasis mine):

At times, the two have been able to put their differences aside in the company of the president, with whom they flew on Air Force One to a Tampa rally for DeSantis in July. While aboard the plane, Gaetz said, Scott was “fumbling through his asks” of the president after opening a large notebook titled “Issues to Discuss with the President on Air Force One” that was filled with maps and engineering drawings of Lake Okeechobee and materials concerning other water-related issues important to Florida. “The president listens politely for about 30 seconds and then just looks at the governor, looks at me, looks back at the governor and then says, ‘Isn’t Matt Gaetz great on television?’” Gaetz recalled. Scott closed the notebook. Other than that anecdote, Gaetz said he doesn’t describe his discussions with the president. Nor does Scott, whose office confirmed the anecdote about the Air Force One flight but said the senator “was proud to work with President Trump to get federal funding to fix the dike at Lake O. Hard to imagine why anyone would criticize that.”

1047,"Best Buy employees turn into ‘Dino Doctors,' help Florida boy with broken toy","0 Best Buy employees turn into ‘Dino Doctors,' help Florida boy with broken toy

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Two Best Buy employees went above and beyond to help a little boy from Florida.

Jordan’s best friend is his dinosaur toy. His mom, Niah Negron, said that her 3-year-old son takes the dinosaur, which he got for Christmas, everywhere. He either is holding it in his hand or it is stuffed in his shirt, ABC News reported.

But the dino lost his head last month and Jordan was heartbroken.

TRENDING NOW:

Negron was able to get the identical toy online at Best Buy and picked it up the same day. But like most kids, Negron said Jordan wouldn’t accept a replacement, he would only accept his “baby.”

So when the mother and son went to the store, she told the employees what had happened.

“We are here for a very delicate matter,” Negron said she told the workers. “You see, we need a dinosaur doctor as the head has broken off of our baby dinosaur.”

Luckily the workers played along.

Tina and Stephanie rushed the baby dino to “surgery,” but in reality, were swapping out the broken toy with a new one, ABC News reported.

As they got the new toy out of the package, they told Jordan, “Just a few more stitches.”

“They pulled off this elaborate hoax with bright smiles and quick action,” Negron wrote on Facebook.

Tina said she didn’t know how big of a deal it was when the “surgery” happened. “But when he saw the dinosaur his whole demeanor changed -- his face lit up so much. We made that little boy’s day.”

If the dino gets broken again, the “dinosaur doctors” have a plan. Stephanie pulled and bought the only other matching dinosaur so they have an emergency backup.

News of the impromptu dinosaur doctors got back to the Best Buy home office, and they were officially promoted to “Dinosaur Doctor” and it’s now documented on their badges, ABC News reported.

1055,Ormond Beach Navy vet tells of making history in WWII,"An old photo rests atop a table in Clint Lake’s Ormond Beach home. In it, he’s young, handsome, and ready to take on the world.

And he did.

Lake had hair then and wasn’t bent or hard of hearing as he is now at 93. And though he can’t seem to find his medals, the World War II Navy veteran’s memory remains sharp.

As a dive bomber radioman and gunner aboard the USS Intrepid, an aircraft carrier whose role in the war was so integral it has its own museum, Lake took part in 19 missions — most before he turned 19. By the time the war was through, Lake had ditched his plane in the ocean, survived a kamikaze attack, and helped destroy the Yamato, an “unsinkable” Japanese battleship.

Lake's story grows more precious with time. Of the 16 million Americans who served in the war, fewer than 500,000 remain.

“It’s kind of scary,” Lake said. “Sometimes I stop and think about it and say, ‘Gee whiz, where is everybody?’”

Lake’s role in the Allied mission to take Okinawa placed him at a historical milestone, and recently officials from the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum came to Ormond Beach to interview him for their oral history project.

“There’s certain things that we can never discover through reading archives and reading books,"" said Jessica Williams, museum curator of history and collections. ""These are things that really can only be brought to life by speaking with people who experienced it directly.”

Okinawa

Wanting to avoid the grunt work of the Army he feared was about draft him, Lake joined the Navy at 17 on Aug. 2, 1943. After radioman and gunnery training, the Miami Florida native was sent to his new home, a ship so massive its crew numbered in the thousands.

“It was enormous. I had never seen anything that big before,” Lake said of the Intrepid. “We drove up there in a bus and we all kind of gaped, ‘I ain’t gonna ride in that thing.’”

Embarking from Pearl Harbor toward the Pacific theater, Lake’s first mission was to attack Kure, a Japanese naval harbor home to, among other things, the Yamato — a battleship so strong it was whispered to be unsinkable.

Lake’s job on the on the two-man SB2C Helldiver dive bomber was to operate the radio, radar, and two 30-caliber machine guns. He did this while facing backwards, and the view, for better or worse, didn’t allow Lake to see what was in front of him. By design, dive bombers flew high before quickly plunging toward their target and dropping their bombs, meaning they had to get fairly close to the enemy.

Though Lake's was among hundreds of planes dispatched to attack Kure, Allied forces weren’t able to sink the enemy warships, leaving the Yamato free to lurk seas and Lake to face her another day.

From Kure, the Intrepid headed to Okinawa where it fought in the war’s last major battle. The plan was to take the airbase there and mount a final campaign on the Japanese home islands.

On Easter Sunday, as part of the colossal force assembled, Lake attacked the island, providing fire so that U.S. forces could storm it.

Records show Okinawa was fortified with more than 100,000 Japanese, many dug in further inland waiting to entrap U.S. forces. While the initial Japanese counterattack was muted, it was Lake’s first experience with being shot at or “walking on flak.”

“You could feel the concussion of the flak exploding by you,” Lake said of the way near-misses from anti-aircraft fire rocked the plane.

But there was too much going on to be frightened, Lake said. And soon, he would be on another mission.

Hunt for the Yamato

Having come to know the Yamato’s menacing reputation first-hand, Lake knew he would be in for a fight. As the lead battleship for Japan’s Imperial Navy, the ship was big, armored, and loaded with a daunting array of more than 200 guns.

Despite the Yamato’s prowess, because of a fuel shortage it was ordered to beach itself at Okinawa and fight until destroyed. If the ship made landfall, its heavy armament and troops — determined to die for their homeland — could wreak havoc for Allied forces already on the island.

“They were going to do what damage they could,” Lake said. “It was kind of a suicide mission and they were going to run this battleship up on land and give the sailors some rifles and say goodbye.”

Fortunately, Allied forces decoded Japan's battle plans and U.S. submarines spotted the Yamato before it made landfall. With this, on April 7, Lake and hundreds of others were ordered to dispatch the monster ship.

A dot in the vast Pacific, the Yamato remained elusive until new coordinates were given, ones that Lake said placed him directly in the ship’s crosshairs.

“We were flying along at about 4,000 feet and someone on the radio said, ‘If you turn right you’ll run right into the big boy,’” Lake said. “We turned right and boom! The ship fired at us.”

As Allied planes swarmed overhead, the Yamato unleashed hell, lighting up the skies with antiaircraft fire. Undaunted, Lake’s plane dove, swooping down to bomb the ship.

While Lake returned to the Intrepid, records show that after a relentless Allied attack, the Yamato hung listless in the sea before capsizing. She exploded before finally plunging into the Pacific’s dark waters.

The myth was no more.

Japan's revenge

The war was not yet over and before Lake would return home, the empire of the rising sun would have its revenge.

On April 16, just 11 days after sinking the Yamato, Lake was below deck filling up his cigarette lighter when the Japanese attacked the Intrepid as it was patrolling the waters near Okinawa. He felt the ship vibrate. Alarms sounded.

“A kamikaze, one of their death planes, attacked us and hit the deck,” Lake said.

The aircraft fired on the ship before crashing through its flight deck, the force propelling the plane clear down into the hangar deck below. A museum excerpt of gunnery officer Lt. Commander William Lindenberger's journal tells of his up-close encounter of the attack.

""We knew he was a “Kami-Kazi” and knew he would fly his plane into us unless we exploded him in mid-air. All the ships guns pumped shells into him but he kept coming down. Pieces of his wing broke off but he didn’t swerve from his course,"" Lindenberger wrote. ""I had the feeling that he couldn’t possibly miss me. Everyone feels that way when a plane is bearing down on him.""

""He passed over my head out of view, our gun ceased firing just before a terrific jar shook the whole ship,"" he wrote. ""Then an explosion resounded through the decks, followed by two distinct shuddering vibrations. It felt as if some giant sledge hammer had fallen with all its force.""

SEE THE ATTACK HERE: Kamikaze suicide plane attacks USS Intrepid (CV-11) - 16 April 1945

With the flight deck ablaze, the ship was locked down as crews worked to put the fire out, Lake said.

All Lake could do was wait and hope.

While he was unharmed in the attack, others weren’t so lucky. Reports show that nine men perished.

The Intrepid, which during the war was struck by a torpedo and survived four kamikaze attacks, was called the “Dry I” because it spent so much time being repaired in dry docks. After the April 16 attack, the ship headed back to the U.S. Most of its crew was ditched at Saipan where they waited until being picked up by another ship.

And in an instant, the war was over.

Like many who served, Lake lost friends but said the cause was worth it. Making a choking motion with his hands, Lake said, “I would’ve liked to have gotten a hold of Hitler myself.”

After the war

Once back in Florida, Lake attended Stetson University, performing as a cheerleader and majoring in teaching. He wound up in banking and worked in DeLand before moving to Ormond Beach and working for what was then known as First Atlantic Bank for 23 years.

After his wife passed away in 1974, Lake married his current wife, Nan, who also was widowed. He has two adopted children from his first marriage and is a stepfather to Nan Lake's four children.

For his service, Lake was awarded two air medals and a gold star.

“I often wondered what would’ve happened to me if there hadn’t had been a war,” he said.

Then he wouldn't have his story, one that Williams said was important and worth preserving.

“There will be a time when there will be no surviving crew members of the Intrepid. We treat these stories the same way we treat our uniforms and our gear and our photograph collection,” Williams said. “Our goal is to ensure they last into the future as long as the Intrepid exists or beyond even ... so they will be available for future generations to learn from and ask questions about and think about.”

Glancing at the 75-year-old photo sitting atop the table, Lake downplayed the notion that he helped shape history.

“I didn’t do anything,” he said.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190402/ormond-beach-navy-vet-tells-of-making-history-in-wwii?rssfeed=true,2019-04-02T12:59:34Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
1060,"UCF, government purchase Bruce Mozert's iconic photos","OCALA — Bruce Mozert, the pioneer of underwater photography, was known more for his stunning pictures than his organization skills.

Mozert, 98, died in October 2015 and left behind a treasure trove of history in his photography studio near Silver Springs State Park.

Inside the studio, there were about a dozen of his original underwater camera housings that he used to snap his first underwater photos in Silver Springs in the 1930s.

Hundreds of decades-old prints depicting movie stars and movie sets were found stacked throughout the studio. Thousands of negatives, some from nearly 90 years ago, were found stuffed in drawers and sometimes mixed with personal vacation images.

The collection captures the days before Disney and Universal Studios, when Silver Springs was ""the"" tourist attraction in Florida.

Despite his iconic connection to Marion County, it was uncertain if his collection would remain here. Soon after Mozert's death, his relatives shopped the collection around, trying to find a buyer.

A local group of concerned citizens began meeting with elected officials and others to fight for the collection. Now, after more than a year of negotiations, Marion County government and the College of Central Florida have teamed with the state Division of Library and Information Services to purchase the collection from Mozert's family for $85,000.

Lois Brauckmuller, CF spokeswoman, said the state paid $42,500 to the family and guaranteed that all of his negatives would be digitally archived. The county and the college each paid $21,250 and can access the digital archive to make prints. The equipment will be stored in Tallahassee and displayed when needed.

Michelle Stone, chair of the Marion County Commission, said preserving the collection was an important mission. Stone said that it was important for the community to keep the collection together.

Stone said the state will digitally archive the photos for anyone to view. The county and CF will have access to print copies.

""He was the first underwater photographer and his work was right here in Marion County,"" Stone noted. ""We didn't want it sold off and split up all over the world.""

CF President Jim Henningsen said the Appleton Museum of Art, which is operated by CF, will one day soon showcase Mozert's camera housings and 20 or so of his iconic photos that were hand colored and autographed by the legend. The exhibit has not been scheduled.

""We are fortunate the family decided to sell so that it (collection) could be preserved for our community,"" Henningsen said.

Since the acquisition of the Mozert collection, Marion County government will be the first to display some of his work. The agency decided to display six of Mozert's framed iconic photographs during Marion County's 175th anniversary celebration, scheduled for 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at the McPherson Governmental Complex, 601 NE 25th Ave., Ocala.

Nick Zoller, a Marion County spokesman, said the six framed photographs will be on display at the Marion County tourism booth.

The subjects of Mozert's framed pictures are:

-Lady sunning on the grassy banks of Silver Springs with a passing glass-bottom boat

• Aerial view of the swimming platform with glass-bottom boats in the background

• Lady underwater laying on the sand using a rotary phone

• Two ladies underwater holding a ""Greetings from Silver Springs"" sign

• Lady playing golf underwater from the ""9th hole water trap""

• A diver using the underwater camera and housing to capture images.

Mozert spent 30 years as Silver Springs' official photographer. He designed and built an underwater camera housing in the 1930s when ""Tarzan"" movies were being filmed at the park. He made a camera housing from Plexiglas, sheet metal and soldering wire. It was pieced together using a few nails and screws.

During an interview with the Star-Banner in 2013, two years before his death, Mozert shared the story of the day he first explored the concept of underwater photography.

""I saw that crystal clear water and that's how I got into my underwater work,"" Mozert said. ""I went out in the backyard of Silver Springs one morning after I had made the camera case and I found an old inner tube. That was back when they were made out of real rubber. I fitted it on my arm and my arm fit tight. I attached it to the housing and took it down in the water. (""Tarzan"" star) Johnny Weissmuller was there. They all laughed at me, but all 12 pictures came out clear. They ended up sending them to Hollywood.""

During Mozert's career at Silver Springs, he shot photos of such notables as Gregory Peck, Lloyd Bridges and Jane Wyman.

""The photos I shot of Jayne Mansfield went worldwide,"" Mozert said in 2013. ""She was nobody until she came to Silver Springs, and boy did she play up the photography.""

And the legend of Bruce Mozert was born.

In 2016, a year after his death, the Appleton showcased more than 100 iconic images, many of which were Mozert's.

The exhibit was called ""Paradise Park Remembered: Photographs by Bruce Mozert and Others."" For 20 years until 1969, Mozert photographed visitors of Paradise Park, which was the African-American version of Silver Springs before integration.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190331/ucf-government-purchase-bruce-mozerts-iconic-photos?rssfeed=true,2019-03-31T18:40:13Z,The Ledger,Couple,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815
1061,Marion County marks 175 years with celebratory festival Saturday,"The celebration at the McPherson Government Complex in Ocala featured music, food, speeches and celebrants in period clothing to commemorate the March 25, 1844, signing that formed Marion County from parts of Alachua, Mosquito (now Orange) and Hillsborough counties.

Marion County celebrated the 175th anniversary its founding on Saturday, with a celebration at the McPherson Government Complex in Ocala.

The celebration commemorated the signing on March 25, 1844, by Richard Keith Call, territorial governor, of legislation authorizing the formation of Marion County from parts of Alachua, Mosquito (now Orange) and Hillsborough counties. A year later, Florida was admitted to the union.

Settlers had agitated for the formation of Marion County because the nearest county seat was at Newnansville, now the town of Alachua, and the journey there was over 50 miles of all-but-impassable sand trails, Darrell G. Riley wrote in “Marion County History,” a 1997 Star-Banner special section.

“Not many people know we became a county a year before Florida became a state,” said Sheriff Billy Woods, dressed in 1840s-style clothing astride his horse, Bull, as he greeted attendees.

Michelle Stone, chairwoman of the Marion County Commission, opened the program with a welcome featuring local elected officials, among them State Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala.

“You’re building a great Florida future for those who come behind us,” Baxley told the audience. “We’re making history, recognizing that we stand on the shoulders of those who came before.”

But while the overall tone of Saturday’s event was celebratory, a roster of speakers giving 15-minute talks in the County Commission auditorium did not shy away from the harsher realities of county history.

Morrey Deen, a former Ocala chief of police, described a complicated and bloody series of events in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that brought Creek Indians and runaway African-American slaves to central Florida, evoking images of Spanish gunrunners, Andrew Jackson and bounty hunters hired by slave owners. He told of the Treaty of Moultrie Creek between the U.S. government and Native American tribal leaders that created a 4-million-acre Indian reservation that stretched from north of Ocala to south of Lakeland. Deen also recounted the aftermath of the Seminole Wars, in which the government relocated Seminole Indians from Florida to Oklahoma.

“The shame of it is, you know what we did?” Deen said. “(The U.S. government later) pushed them out of Oklahoma because we had the great land rush.”

Cynthia Wilson-Graham presented a talk on Paradise Park, the attraction on the Silver River, alongside Silver Springs, for African-American tourists. Wilson-Graham, author of “Remembering Paradise Park: Tourism and Segregation at Silver Springs,” noted that Silver Springs had a black workforce in the days of segregation that was barred from visiting the park as tourists.

“They could work there, they could garden, they could take guests on the boat rides, but they could not mingle with the guests,” she said.

Wilson-Graham said that until the desegregation of Silver Springs in 1969, both parks were marketed nationally to tourists and Paradise Park was home to large Labor Day celebrations and annual gatherings of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

“The guests that went to Silver Springs had somewhere to stay,” Wilson-Graham said. “They could be accommodated in different hotels and motels, but for the guests of Paradise Park, they had maybe one or two hotels here. They had to basically, go and stay at houses with other people.”

Outside, Saturday’s event included festival-like touches like musical entertainment, food trucks and booths staffed by representatives of local government agencies, companies and nonprofit organizations.

Karin Ahrman of Ocala worked a booth for the Marion County chapter of Harley’s Dream, a nonprofit organization dedicated to banning commercial dog breeding enterprises known as “puppy mills.”

“The traffic’s been pretty good,” Ahrman said at about noon. “We’ve handed out about 150 temporary tattoos for children, 100 pet food lids and I don’t know how many of our bracelets.

“(Turnout) isn’t as big as I thought, but it’s starting to get crowded,” she said.

In the lobby of the commission auditorium, organizers displayed the contents for a time capsule to be opened in 25 years for the county bicentennial, including: badges contributed by local first-responder agencies; an anniversary proclamation from the Dunnellon City Council; and a shell casing found at the Ocklawaha site of the 1935 shootout between the Barker-Karpis gang and FBI agents that killed Ma Barker and her son, Fred, donated by George Albright, county tax collector.

At the close of the celebration, Brandon Kalloo, a public information officer with the county, said traffic counters were still tabulating figures but estimated the day’s attendance at “several thousand.”

Friends and readers generally tag yours truly as a conservative, though I do view some issues with a liberal lean. Capital punishment is one of those issues.

I’m no bleeding heart. During my 30 years with Miami-Dade Police, 16 working homicides, I’ve been witness to hundreds of premeditated killings, gore, deadly riots and inhumanity of people killing other people. For those who plot and carry out grisly murders, I believe they should receive the harshest of punishments. But not death.

Who decided death to be harsh? Is it harsh when an inmate pleads for a rapid end of life, as did Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing? Is it harsh when we condemn our pets to die by a needle because it’s “humane?” Is eternal sleep a punishment?

The new governor of California recently made news by banning executions for all its 737 death row inmates. In fact, California has not executed an inmate in 13 years.

More: Here's why I ... FLORIDA TODAY wants you to finish that sentence

There are many reasons to halt executions. The top of the list is the fear and probability that even one innocent human being may be, or has been, executed. That probability is simply too high. We can look to our own justice system in Florida and find many cases where truly innocent persons were convicted of crimes they did not commit, such as William Dillon and Wilton Dedge, both featured in FLORIDA TODAY's podcast Murder of the Space Coast. There are others whose guilt is very dubious, as with another subject of the podcast, Gary Bennett, now in his 35th year in prison.

These cases are the ones we know about in Brevard County. What about the rest of the country? The men named above did not get the death penalty, though they wrongfully spent over two and three decades in prison.

According to the Death Penalty Information Center, there have been 20 death row inmates released since 1992 based at least in part on DNA evidence showing them to be innocent. DNA material only appears in a fraction of violent crimes. Murder cases do not always yield such evidence.

The only guarantee that innocent people will never be executed, is to abolish capital punishment. That’s the only guarantee.

A 2014 study by the National Academy of Sciences reports that at least 4 percent of death row convicts are actually innocent. What are we waiting for?

There are other reasons to abolish capital punishment, such as:

• Costs: Numerous studies have been conducted that clearly show that maintaining the death penalty consumes at least double, or triple, the cost of imposing life sentences.

• No deterrent: More studies have determined that the death penalty does not deter violent crime.

• Death row inmates in Florida are confined to solitary confinement in a concrete and steel cell, 24 hours a day, with no air conditioning and no social interaction. Gary Alvord, 66, died of natural causes on death row where he spent almost 40 years. Many inmates spend more than three decades in isolation.

• Economic inequities: The rich get the best lawyers. The poor get the worst lawyers.

• Barbarism: The U.S. has the seventh highest number of executions in the world, among such company as Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Pakistan.

• Eighteen states have banned the death penalty. Of 32 states still on the books, only five have been active in carrying out executions, including Florida.

• Execution by injection is not punishment: The real punishment is suffering death row for 20 to 40 years.

• People change: Often, especially after decades in isolation, we are no longer executing the same person who committed the crime. Napoleon Beazley, a 17-year-old Texas boy robbed and shot a man for his car. At his execution in May of 2002, Beazley spoke his final words:

“The act I committed to put me here was not just heinous, it was senseless,” he said. “But the person that committed that act is no longer here — I am.”

Capital punishment has one redeeming aspect. It’s often used as a wedge to secure guilty pleas in order to avert trials.

That’s a poor reason for maintaining the risk.

1063,Fire leaves children without clothes,"FORT WALTON BEACH — A mother and her children were left without some clothes and school uniforms after a fire damaged their home Thursday.

Stephanie Coles said her sister-in-law lived in the house on Bay Street in Sylvania Heights and had a 2-year-old child with her when the fire started.

""She's real shaken up right now,"" Coles said.

A man working on a car outside noticed the smoke coming from the home and called 911, Coles said.

The 2-year-old boy was scared and crying as his grandmother held him. Coles said they might take him to the hospital.

No one was seriously injured, but Coles' sister-in-law lost some possessions.

""She's already living with somebody, so that goes to show you right there she's not on her feet completely,"" Coles said. ""That just kicks you down another notch.""

Coles said she was amazed at the emergency crews' response time.

Firefighters crews responded to the fire about noon and contained the blaze believed to have started in the clothes dryer.

According to the Fort Walton Beach Fire Department, the home sustained about $4,000 in damage, mostly from smoke.

One person was treated at the scene but did not go to the hospital.

Justin Gigiello, of Connecticut, has gone viral for singing ""Ave Maria"" in the lobby of the Grand Floridian on March 20.

According to Gigiello’s Facebook post, his daughter saw a pianist and asked him if he could play while her father sang along, and boy was she proud of her dad.

What an impromptu performance, all because of his biggest little fan.

Wanda Van Blarcume gets emotional just thinking about what could have happened had she not been watching a surveillance camera over pool at the hotel where she works on Sunday night. Van Blarcume was working at the front desk and switched the screen she was watching when she saw two boys playing near the pool, but a moment later one of them was struggling in the water and then completely out of sight. She immediately called another worker, Michael Johnson, to help the boy. ""I picked up the radio and I said, 'Maintenance, get over to the hot tub. There's a little boy drowning,' and I could see him struggling,"" Van Blarcume said. ""I'm thinking, 'These adults are going to notice him.'""As she waited for rescuers to arrive at the Perry's Ocean Edge Resort, she watched as Johnson immediately started CPR on the boy, who is 3 years old. A hotel guest who saw the rescue from her room upstairs, rushed down to help. The child's father also ran over. At first the boy was not responding, but did start breathing again. ""It was a team effort, but, I'm just glad I was watching,"" Van Blarcume told WESH 2. The boy was rushed to Halifax Hospital in Daytona Beach and then to Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando. He was in critical condition Sunday night, but officials said since then, he has made a dramatic improvement. ""He's going to pull through, which is a blessing,"" Van Blarcume said. Apryl Connolly is the child's mother and was arrested at the resort after she was found intoxicated. She appeared in court Monday and a judge told her not to have unsupervised contact with the 3-year-old. Van Blarcume said she hopes Sunday night's scare is a lesson to parents everywhere to keep close eyes on children at all times, and especially near pools and water. ""It didn't hit me and then after I called my husband and I just broke down crying you know to see someone helpless. It was sad,"" Van Blarcume said.

1071,"10-year-old boy commits suicide after relentless bullying, mom says","KATY, Texas - A 10-year-old boy killed himself after what his mother called ""relentless bullying"" at school.

Kevin Reese, Jr. was a fifth-grader at Robinson Elementary School outside Houston who used to love drawing and painting, KTRK reports.

""Kevin was a goofy child,"" Kevin's mother Crystal Smith said. ""He's my little goof troop, I called him.""

However, Smith says her son was constantly being bullied at school and committed suicide by hanging himself in a closet on Jan. 21.

""He just had enough. He just had enough and he felt that he was backed into a corner.""

Kevin and his 13-year-old sister came home that day while Smith was out of town for work. The boy took his own life before their stepdad made it home.

Kevin's sister called her mother to say what had happened.

""She was just screaming on the phone, and I didn't understand and she screamed, 'Kevin,'"" Crystal said.

Crystal said she had called officials at her son's school to ask about bullying, but she was told they never found any proof of the behavior. The school official who communicated with Crystal has been reassigned.

The family has kept Kevin's room the same, as if he still lives in the home.

""This is his book bag from that day, that's his homework, his ID, he has it attached to his backpack,"" Crystal said.

1072,Officer helps in rescue of teddy bear after boy with autism makes 911 call,"A young boy’s parents are grateful to a police officer who showed up at their home after an unusual 911 call from their 12-year-old son with autism.

Ryan Paul was so distraught, according to News 12 New Jersey, that he did what he was taught to do in emergencies: call 911.

Officer Khari Manzini arrived at Ryan's home earlier this month after the boy made the call.

“The teddy bear fell down again. Don’t worry, I’ll rescue you. Goodbye again, see you again,” Ryan could be heard saying on the call.

Manzini said after learning Ryan has autism, he used training he received from the organization POAC Autism Services and helped the boy look for his bear.

POAC Autism Services has trained more than 67,000 first responders in New Jersey in autism recognition, according to News 12 New Jersey. The group says that the training has saved lives.

Manzini said they found the bear, named Freddy, and it is back in safe hands.

“We came as fast as we could,” Manzini said. “Ryan was very happy to see me, and I was actually happy to see him happy, and that we had gotten the teddy bear back.”

Ryan's father, Robert Paul, later thanked the officer for responding, saying he was ""gracious and understanding.""

Robert Paul said he’s proud his son knew what to do in an emergency.

“We just need to fine-tune it a little bit, as to when it actually gets used,” he said.

Note: 911.gov says teaching children the appropriate usage of the 911 system is just as important as teaching them how to place the call. Click here to learn more about 911 for Kids.

1073,"Florida toddler killed, woman injured in dog attack","ALACHUA COUNTY, Fla. - A toddler was killed and a woman was injured in a dog attack Friday morning at a home near High Springs, the Alachua County Sheriff's Office said.

It happened about 10:30 a.m. at a home on Northwest 210th Avenue, just west of Interstate 75.

According to the Sheriff's Office, dogs living at the home attacked two family members -- a 2-year-old boy and a woman. Deputies said the 2-year-old died from his injuries at the house and the woman was taken to an area hospital with traumatic injuries.

Detectives with the Sheriff's Office continue to investigate, though initial information indicates two dogs were involved in the attack on the family property and the injured woman fought them off, deputies said.

“This (is) an incredible tragedy for the family involved,” said Lt. Brett Rhodenizer, with the Sheriff's Office. “Our investigation will ultimately determine the facts that led up to the attack, but no answers will ever make up for the loss of a child.”

The dogs involved were seized by Alachua County Animal Services, and members of the Alachua County Crisis Team have responded to assist the family.

Officers with the neighboring High Springs and Alachua police departments also responded.

1078,"Ocala Scouts, now including girls, enjoy Pinewood Derby","Classic event is a chance for kids and family members to work together.

Imagination supplied the spark and gravity provided the fuel on Saturday as Cub Scouts ranging from kindergarten age to the fourth grade rolled their hand-crafted wooden model cars down a four-lane inclined track while surrounded by cheering family and friends at the annual Scouts BSA North Florida Council/Marion District Pinewood Derby.

The top three winners in each of five categories will go to the regional finals on May 4 at Bass Pro Shop in Gainesville.

This year's competition, held at St. Paul's United Methodist Church, included the first participation in the races by girls in Marion County Cub Scout packs.

Steve Hickman, cubmaster of Tiger Pack 18, said girls were admitted into Scouts BSA as of February 2018, and five of the 57 racers at Saturday's event were girls. Hickman referred to the ""inclusive environment"" at the event and praised it as a ""full family experience.""

Annabelle Cruce, 7, of Tiger Pack 18, raced a pink ""Unicorn Fantasy"" car and took third place in the Tiger division, making her the first female scout to place in the local Pinewood Derby. She will advance to Gainesville.

She was adamant that the pink paint made her car go faster, but she also ""took a weight off.""

The track used at the event Saturday was made of metal rather than wood. The competition had computerized scoring and a clock.

Teresa Lanning, committee chair with Boy Scout Troop 692 and Cub Scout Pack 692 and scoutmaster of the six-member Scouts BSA Girl Troop 692, said during the event that she has ""the first female scout in the area who received the Arrow of Light award and crossed over to Scouts BSA Girl Troop 692.""

""Two other girls have earned their Arrow of Light and will be crossing over soon from their Cub Scout pack,"" Lanning said.

Marion District Pinewood Derby Chair Bill Holland said the event is aimed at fostering qualities like leadership and sportsmanship. Holland's wife, Robin, and their son, Casey, 11, have participated in five prior races, and a shelf at their home holds past entries including one called ""Sting Like A Bee.""

Cub Scouts assemble their own scale cars, which may be no heavier than 5 ounces, Hickman stated. Entrants focus on weight placement, axles and alignment.

Hickman said this was also the inaugural year for kindergartners to race in the Lions division.

The cars are often a joint venture involving scout and parents; as they grow older, many scouts complete their own cars.

Keileb Negron, 9, took first place in the third grade Bears division. His parents, Jackeline Negron and Tony Duarte, cheered him on as he bested the other entries with his ""Golden Dasher"" car.

Daniel and Gina Gentry were at the derby with their sons Anthony, 9, racing in his fourth event, and Daniel III, 12, who raced in four prior derbys and is now a Scout. Anthony took third place in the Webelos, or fourth grade, division.

Jeremy Harrell enjoyed an afternoon of racing with his stepson Ethan, 6.

Truman Magley, senior Marion district executive, said the district now has about 30 female scouts in three troops. He said the Pinewood Derby is a chance for ""scout and parents to work together to develop skills.""

Ryan and Jessica Pilch came to the races with their daughter, Vivian, 8, and son, Ethan, 5, both in Scouts USA. Ethan finished second in the Lions or kindergartner division.

Vivian said she was drawn to scouting by archery, and she likes outdoor activity.

1083,"Leesburg men shot at children walking home, used racial slurs, police say","James Reidnauer, 31, and Brent Van Besien, 33, are accused of calling two Leesburg children racial slurs and shooting at them.

LEESBURG, Fla. - A Lake County mother can be heard in a 911 call telling her children to stay down and away from the windows after two white men called the siblings racial slurs and shot at them sending them running home.

The 12-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy were walking home on Goose Prairie Road March 17 from the BP gas station and cut through the area near a church when the victims said James Reidnauer, 31, and Brent Van Besien, 33, confronted them.

The area where the victims were walking was near the Lisbon Church of God where Lake County students are picked up and dropped off by the school bus, the victims' mother said in the 911 call.

""They tried to block them in before with their truck,"" she said.

The siblings said Reidnauer asked, ""What are you doing?"" to which the 16-year-old said ""just walking home with his sister.""

At which point Reidenauer again asked ""What are you doing?"" and Van Besisen called the 16-year-old a racial slur before both men fired their guns at the children, according to the arrest report.

The siblings ran home and in the 911 call from their mother it's clear they were running out of fear. Police who responded said neither child was injured but ""both were visibly frightened.""

[WARNING GRAPHIC LANGUAGE IN 911 CALL BELOW]

In the 911 call the mother tells her children they shouldn't have even responded to the men's questions, ""You don’t ever speak you just run.""

When deputies spoke with the suspects, both men said they had confronted two ""meth heads"" and Reidnauer fired ""a warning shot into the ground to prevent them from breaking into the house."" Van Besien, who is a convicted felon, said only Reidnauer fired the shot. Deputies said they found bullet casings from a Smith and Wesson 9 mm.

Both men described the victims as a ""brown guy"" and a ""white girl"" who were in their 20s or 30s, according to the report. Deputies said Van Besien ""then changed his story saying he never actually got a good look at the people because he was quite a distance away.""

Reidnauer and Van Besien are both charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a firearm during a hate crime. Van Beisen faces additional charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

Lake County Jail records show both suspects were booked into the jail March 18 and have not posted bond.

As a dispatcher tried to calm the mother telling her to take deep breaths. She responded ""We have to get out of this neighborhood.""

""They weren’t doing anything,"" she said. ""All they did was walk home from the store.""

1084,I'm a retired cop. Here's why I ... am a conservative and against the death penalty | Opinion,"CLOSE FLORIDA TODAY's Christina LaFortune talks with Government Editor Dave Berman about the county commission's changing stance on pet sales. Rob Landers, FLORIDA TODAY

Friends and readers generally tag yours truly as a conservative, though I do view some issues with a liberal lean. Capital punishment is one of those issues.

I’m no bleeding heart. During my 30 years with Miami-Dade Police, 16 working homicides, I’ve been witness to hundreds of premeditated killings, gore, deadly riots and inhumanity of people killing other people. For those who plot and carry out grisly murders, I believe they should receive the harshest of punishments. But not death.

Who decided death to be harsh? Is it harsh when an inmate pleads for a rapid end of life, as did Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing? Is it harsh when we condemn our pets to die by a needle because it’s “humane?” Is eternal sleep a punishment?

The new governor of California recently made news by banning executions for all its 737 death row inmates. In fact, California has not executed an inmate in 13 years.

There are many reasons to halt executions. The top of the list is the fear and probability that even one innocent human being may be, or has been, executed. That probability is simply too high. We can look to our own justice system in Florida and find many cases where truly innocent persons were convicted of crimes they did not commit, such as William Dillon and Wilton Dedge, both featured in FLORIDA TODAY's podcast Murder of the Space Coast. There are others whose guilt is very dubious, as with another subject of the podcast, Gary Bennett, now in his 35th year in prison.

These cases are the ones we know about in Brevard County. What about the rest of the country? The men named above did not get the death penalty, though they wrongfully spent over two and three decades in prison.

According to the Death Penalty Information Center, there have been 20 death row inmates released since 1992 based at least in part on DNA evidence showing them to be innocent. DNA material only appears in a fraction of violent crimes. Murder cases do not always yield such evidence.

The only guarantee that innocent people will never be executed, is to abolish capital punishment. That’s the only guarantee.

A 2014 study by the National Academy of Sciences reports that at least 4 percent of death row convicts are actually innocent. What are we waiting for?

There are other reasons to abolish capital punishment, such as:

• Costs: Numerous studies have been conducted that clearly show that maintaining the death penalty consumes at least double, or triple, the cost of imposing life sentences.

• No deterrent: More studies have determined that the death penalty does not deter violent crime.

• Death row inmates in Florida are confined to solitary confinement in a concrete and steel cell, 24 hours a day, with no air conditioning and no social interaction. Gary Alvord, 66, died of natural causes on death row where he spent almost 40 years. Many inmates spend more than three decades in isolation.

• Economic inequities: The rich get the best lawyers. The poor get the worst lawyers.

• Barbarism: The U.S. has the seventh highest number of executions in the world, among such company as Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Pakistan.

• Eighteen states have banned the death penalty. Of 32 states still on the books, only five have been active in carrying out executions, including Florida.

• Execution by injection is not punishment: The real punishment is suffering death row for 20 to 40 years.

• People change: Often, especially after decades in isolation, we are no longer executing the same person who committed the crime. Napoleon Beazley, a 17-year-old Texas boy robbed and shot a man for his car. At his execution in May of 2002, Beazley spoke his final words:

“The act I committed to put me here was not just heinous, it was senseless,” he said. “But the person that committed that act is no longer here — I am.”

Capital punishment has one redeeming aspect. It’s often used as a wedge to secure guilty pleas in order to avert trials.

That’s a poor reason for maintaining the risk.

1087,"Indian River County teen shot in botched robbery attempt, deputies say","CLOSE If you see a crime being committed, leave anonymous tips on the Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers hotline, web site or smart phone app. 2019 GINNY BEAGAN/TCPALM Wochit

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — A gun sale-turned-robbery attempt went awry Wednesday, landing one person in the hospital with a gunshot wound in a case that authorities initially reported as a drive-by shooting, sheriff's officials said.

The shooting was reported at 5:51 p.m. in front of a home in the 1000 block of 10th Place, south of Vero Beach, said Maj. Eric Flowers of the Indian River County Sheriff's Office.

Flowers said two men, 18 and 19 years old, and a 15-year-old boy pulled up to the home in a Chevrolet Suburban after arranging to meet a second juvenile to buy a handgun.

The second juvenile, a 17-year-old boy, instead pulled the gun on them and demanded their money, Flowers said.

As he continued to threaten them, Flowers said the 18-year-old pulled a second handgun from beneath a seat and fired one round through the window, striking the 17-year-old. The three in the SUV then fled.

The second juvenile was found in the street with serious injuries, Flowers said.

He was taken to Lawnwood Regional Medical Center & Heart Institute in Fort Pierce, where he was recovering Thursday.

Deputies located the others after using private security video to identify the vehicle.

The SUV, firearms and an undisclosed amount of cash were recovered, Flowers said.

Charges were expected, he said, but as of Thursday had not been filed.

1088,Federal grand jury indicts truck driver accused of kidnapping 2 children,"A federal grand jury has indicted a truck driver from Jacksonville accused of kidnapping two children from Texas.

The indictment charges Marshall Pendergrass, 47, with two counts of kidnapping.

He is set for arraignment Thursday at 10 a.m. in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Pendergrass was taken into custody March 16 in northern Arizona after authorities said they found two children who used to live in Jacksonville and who were abducted from Texas held captive in the cab of his semitruck.

According to a federal complaint obtained last week by News4Jax, the 12-year-old boy and his 14-year-old sister told police that they were kidnapped by the Jacksonville truck driver and bound with zip ties and duct tape during their ordeal.

Pendergrass told investigators he learned the children ""ran away"" from home and he said he planned to take them back home, the complaint stated.

GUYTON, Ga. - Five relatives charged in the death of a Georgia girl now faces charges in the death of her brother as well.

The Savannah Morning News reported their father, 50-year-old Elwyn Crocker Sr., their stepmother and three others are each indicted on two charges of felony murder, child cruelty and concealing a death.

Effingham County sheriff's investigators say a tip led authorities in December to the bodies of 14-year-olds Mary Crocker and Elwyn Crocker Jr, which were buried in their father's yard. Both had been homeschooled and never reported missing.

The indictment issued last week alleges that like his sister, Elwyn had been beaten, starved and kept in a dog crate.

Authorities said all five defendants were moved out of the Effingham County to separate jail locations for their safety.

The defendants are set to be arraigned next month.

A little boy went face down in a jacuzzi and nearly drowned Sunday night.

Police say his mom was drunk, high and not paying attention.

A quick-thinking hotel employee jumped into action and saved the child.

The upsetting incident was all caught on camera.

It happened at Perry’s Ocean Edge Resort.

A maintenance man switched off the jets and pulled the boy out after he was submerged for more than two minutes.

Police then questioned the child's mother.

Police say Apryl Connolly, 36, waived her right to remain silent and told officers she had taken three shots of tequila, was mixing booze with pills and smoking pot.

Police said Apryl Connolly, 36, was at Perry's Ocean Edge Resort with her twins boys and the children's father Sunday night and while the man went to gather the family's belongings, Connolly was supposed to be watching the children.

A front desk clerk who was watching surveillance footage saw the twins return to the hot tub and were standing on an interior seat, then one of them stepped into the middle and went underwater, according to a news release.

The witness called a staff member to respond to the pool and when he arrived, a guest said she had seen the boy floating in the hot tub, police said. The staff member turned off the hot tub jets, saw the boy submerged and jumped in to save him, according to authorities.

The boy was not breathing and he had no pulse.

The staff member and the boy's father began CPR until a guest was able to take over and get the child to breath on his own, the report said. The boy was taken to Halifax Medical Center, then transported to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children due to the severity of his injuries.

Police said surveillance video showed that Connolly was throwing away a pill while her child was being resuscitated. She also admitted to consuming alcohol, marijuana, oxycodone and suboxone prior to the incident, the report said.

Connolly is facing charges of child neglect and destruction of evidence.

1097,"Why a Florida pit bull went from Lehigh Acres to Michigan, and back again (and again)","Blue, a pit bull mix puppy, takes a dip in the Atlantic Ocean in Florida. (Photo: handout photo)

Blue, the pit bull puppy from Lehigh Acres, has traveled more than 5,000 miles in the last five days.

People across the country have been following the journey. But the puppy hasn't been traveling for fun. She's been shuffled between the Michigan shelter that found her and the owner they tried to reunite her with 1,400 miles away in Lehigh Acres over the weekend.

But her original owner apparently could no longer care for her, and the people who had volunteered to drive the pup back to Lehigh took her back to Michigan with them.

Blue was expected to be with her new family in Michigan by Tuesday night.

But how — and why — did Blue have to make both trips?

No one knows exactly, said Beth Wellman with the Humane Society of Midland County in Michigan. ""We don't know how she got here in the first place,"" she said of Blue.

The puppy, who is almost 1 year old, was found wandering a road in the frigid Midland area last week and was brought into the shelter as a stray. The shelter scanned for a microchip implant that linked Blue back to her 22-year-old owner in Lehigh Acres.

When they spoke with the owner, she told them she did indeed want her dog back. The shelter arranged for volunteers who frequent Florida to drive her back down over the weekend, a task Wellman said the shelter has had to do in similar situations.

By the time they had arrived, something had changed with the owner's family and they said they could no longer help care for Blue while her owner, a college student and nurse's assistant, was in class or working.

So the volunteers drove her back to Midland. She made it to the shelter Tuesday morning, and by the afternoon she had a new owner scheduled to pick her up and take her home after work.

More: After a long trip home, lost dog's owner said she no longer wants her

Hundreds of people followed Blue's story and offered to adopt the 35-pound puppy. The shelter received about a dozen applications, several email inquires and countless phone calls, Wellman said.

A post announcing Blue's adoption on the shelter's Facebook page garnered hundreds of comments expressing how happy people were to see Blue get adopted.

Wellman said she wanted to remind people that although Blue has an interesting story, there are thousands of animals like her in need of homes in shelters across the country.

""Pit bulls are the highest-killed dog in this country,"" she said. ""I try to encourage people to always think adoption first.""

As for Blue's new family?

They're a family of three who recently lost their senior pit bull to old age, Wellman said. Blue won't have any canine or feline brothers or sisters.

Blue's new dad came in to meet her and signed the adoption papers during his lunch hour Tuesday. His spouse is a stay-at-home mom, so she'll be able to spend lots of time with Blue, Wellman said. Blue will also be joined by an 11-year-old boy in her new home.

""This will hopefully be her forever home after all she's been through,"" Wellman said. ""That was a tremendous journey, especially for a dog.""

1107,Midway mark: Here are 8 divides lawmakers must bridge in back half of legislative session,"Buy Photo Gov. Ron DeSantis shakes hands with Senate President Bill Galvano after giving his State of the State address during the opening day of session for the Florida Legislature Tuesday, March 5, 2019. (Photo: Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat)

The Florida Legislature has crossed the Rubicon, the point of no return.

The House and Senate have each charted their own separate courses through the financial straits of the budget process, creating a wide gulf between them on various priorities from the environment to education.

And they’ve also got several controversial policy measures they don’t exactly see eye to eye on, but at least they’re talking.

The consensus – especially among Republicans – is things are going pretty well, especially compared to years past when an uncommunicative governor and a discordant Legislature couldn’t come to terms on many important issues.

What helps first-year Gov. Ron DeSantis with the Legislature is the respect he has for the process, Senate President Bill Galvano said.



“It feels much more collaborative than it did under the last administration,” Galvano said. “The last administration was very successful in many, many ways but it is certainly a different style of relationships between the two branches... ""

But it will take more than goodwill to meet their single constitutional obligation to pass a balanced budget before they can go home on time on May 3. It will take horse-trading and compromise on four to five key spending issues, as well as coming to terms on several hot-button issues that could complicate budget negotiations.

Budget paradox

The budget takes center stage as the Legislature moves into the second half of the session.

DeSantis wants to increase the state budget by more than $2 billion to $91.3 million. The Senate is willing to meet him halfway, but House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes, pronounced it dead on arrival.

“The overall goal is to be below what we spent last year per resident,” Oliva said. “That’s the goal we set for ourselves.”

The House has approved an $88.9 billion spending plan, $400 million short of the Senate’s plan – which doesn’t include a $250 million revenue share from Indian casinos.

Fleming Island Republican Sen. Rob Bradley, who chairs the appropriations committee, said it would be a mistake to take anything off the table right now.

Florida Forever or just sometimes?

While the two chambers appear to be close, they want to spend money in dramatically different ways.

The House earmarked $3.9 billion for the environment – twice as much as the Senate. Both proposals shortchange DeSantis’ goal to spend $100 million on the land-buying program, Florida Forever. The Senate has proposed $45 million while the House is in at $20 million.

But he’s happy they support water quality programs.

“I thought we were going to be haggling towards the end where I’m like we need more money for Everglades,” DeSantis said.

Jonathan Webber, deputy director for Florida Conservation voters, said DeSantis appears more sincere than Scott, whom he called an election year environmentalist.

“We will know the truth when it comes around budget time, we will know exactly what his team is fighting for in the end,"" Webber said. ""Is it just the Everglades or the rest of the state?”

One bill that appears dead, SB 944, by Democrat Sen. Linda Stewart of Orlando, would fully fund Florida Forever at $100 million a year every year.

It's the same bill from Bradley from last year that passed out of the Senate unanimously but has stalled this year in committee.

“Why it’s not moving this year is anyone’s guess,” Webber said.

Education: 'Good faith' amid the factions

The Senate, meanwhile, wants to spend $500 million more than the House on education.

“It is certainly a move in the right direction, it will be good news to school districts throughout the state,” Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee, said about the Senate proposal, which includes more money for teachers, school safety and mental health programs.

Buy Photo Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee. (Photo: Hali Tauxe/Democrat)

The Senate’s plan to increase per-student spending by $350 is more than double the House’s initial offer. The House also wants to move more money into vouchers.



“There are some differences on education, but these are manageable difference between the two sides,” Bradley said. “And I’ve seen spreads a lot greater than it is now so we’re going to work in good faith.”

The House and Senate also part over higher education spending. The House would cut university funding by 2.5 percent – or $100 million.

“I think higher ed and K-12 clearly are going to be a couple issues where some negotiations are made. That’s very apparent,” said House Appropriations Chair Travis Cummings, R-Orange Park.

Highways versus hospitals

This is the point in the session when a lot of posturing takes place and the priorities of the Senate President and House Speaker become bargaining chips.

“The phrase people are using is trading highways for hospitals,” House Minority Policy Chair Evan Jenne, D-Hollywood. “We are heading into a situation where that could become a reality.”

Galvano wants an ambitious transportation modernization package that repurposes millions of dollars in Motor Vehicle tax revenue – starting at $45 million this year and ultimately growing to $140 million a year by 2022.

The express toll lanes are Sun Pass only lanes and cost anywhere from less than a dollar to $10 based on the number of drivers using them. The more demand, the higher the price. (Photo: FDOT)

It envisions three multi-modal corridors and the expansion or creation of three toll-roads.

An encouraging sign is that a House version of Galvano’s bill had its first hearing Thursday in the Transportation and Tourism Appropriations Subcommittee chaired by Panama City Republican Jay Trumbull.

""I don’t truly believe south South Florida is anywhere near one of these corridors are,” Rep. Matt Willhite, D-Royal Palm Beach, said, referring to Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.

The Senate, on the other hand, has put on hold Oliva’s signature healthcare measures — deregulating safety net hospitals and eliminating certificates of need. It's on the Health Committee's agenda for Monday.

“Without a doubt, healthcare costs are a runaway train,” Oliva, a Republican from Miami Lakes, has told reporters in the early days of the session. It was 33 percent of the state budget when he was first elected in 2011 and is now approaching 48 percent.

Hurricane recovery: 'The elephant in the room'

There is also a $2 billion hurricane recovery bill looming overhead like an unwieldy Thanksgiving Parade balloon that some say could break the budget.

“Hurricane recovery is the elephant in the room, impacting every discussion,” said Evan Power, chairman of the Leon County Republican Party.

Jenne said it was disappointing that more money wasn’t being spent on helping the farming and logging industry devastated by hurricane damage.

“I’m just a city boy but I am not excited or pleased with the state response to the Panhandle cattle ranchers and peanut farmers,” Jenne said. “They’re devastated. We have to help them out. But there is not a penny for agricultural recovery out of that $2 billion.”

He also didn’t see any bills preparing Florida for a future where it is hit by at least one major hurricane a year.

“In the last 18 months every part of Florida has been slapped around by a hurricane and there is no long-term planning,” Jenne said while quipping that the House will never take the issue up until they are up to their ankles in seawater.

Montford said he and fellow Panhandle senators George Gainer of Panama City and Doug Broxson of Pensacola will work together to present a strong case to their colleagues.

“We’ve got three, four billion dollars in a rainy-day account so let’s dip into that,"" Montford said.

A flood of water quality bills

The Legislature is also moving along clean water legislation.

“Last summer’s coastal water crisis really lit a fire in the public’s mind,” Webber said. “They were extremely vocal and active throughout the summer and the election, letting legislators know we need to do something at every public hearing.”

The result is a lot of bills introduced early that address water quality. Some have moved and others haven’t, Webber said.

Turning the Toxic Tide:Florida must address the problem of human waste

Republican Rep. Randy Fine of Palm Bay has a bill that addresses septic tanks and their impact on the Indian River Lagoon, he said. Vero Beach Republican Rep. Erin Grall has a bill to address biosolids and Sen. Debbie Mayfield, R-Melbourne, has filed the Clean Waterways Act, which has a second committee hearing on Tuesday.

“Funding to do more water quality protection was expected,” Webber said. “That’s a good thing and the Legislature deserves praise for that. We are hoping to move those bills in the second half of session.""

Sanctuary cities: Yearly fight 'has legs'

The Legislature still has several contentious policy issues to deal with that are alive and well and taking up a lot of time and energy: implementing Amendment 4 to restore the voting rights of felons who have served their sentences, reforming the insurance industry's assignment of benefits rule, the so-called “anti-sanctuary cities” bill, and arming more teachers with guns.

“Honestly, the last previous two sessions were pretty contentious, but some of the same bills we battled then are alive now,” said Karen Woodall, executive director Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy. “We are spending the majority of our time fighting bad bills. Good ones are not placed on the agenda and die because they don’t get heard.”

Immigration issues in the session:

The “anti-sanctuary cities” bill, so called because there is no definition of sanctuary cities, might pass this time around and is moving quickly through both houses.

The measure made it through the House in the past two sessions, but was blocked in the Senate by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans.

This year, some of those Republican allies are no longer in office, and Democrats may not have enough votes to block it on the Senate side.

Sarasota Sen. Joe Gruters, who also is chair of the state GOP, has tried to thread the needle by saying his measure simply requires local governments to follow federal requests to detain undocumented immigrants with a criminal history.

“Sanctuary cities has legs,” Jenne said. “If the chair of the Republican Party gets something moving you’d be hard pressed to stop him.”

Home rule erosion

Advocates find themselves fighting a lot of bills that restrict rights of cities to do what is best for their citizens, Woodall said.

They were completely caught off guard by a proposal that popped up 16 hours before Thursday morning’s judiciary committee hearing that would create barriers for organizers of grassroots citizen petitions to change the constitution get their items on the ballot.

CLOSE Florida League of Mayors tell Florida lawmakers to stay in their lane James Call, Democrat Capitol Reporter

Palm Coast Republican Rep. Paul Renner said the bill was solely to protect the Florida Constitution from outside influence.

""We are making sure it's actually a grassroots effort by Floridians and not manipulated by outside special interests,"" Renner told reporters Thursday.

Opponents counter that people should be concerned about the further deterioration of home rule, from prohibiting cities from banning plastic drinking straws to determining if their local sheriff will help ICE on every detainer request, Jenne said.

If these pre-emption bills were all taken to their logical extreme, he said, there would be no more cities or counties, “just one very large state government over 20 million people.”

The GOP has been very successful pushing its agenda, Jenne said.

“Nothing makes me go home and say that was a good day for Florida,” he said. “The Legislature is whittling away everything we worked at for all these years. It’s going to be a bumpier ride moving forward.”

Woodall hopes that as more people become aware of the impact of these bills on local governments they will reach out to their legislators and pressure them to change or narrow the scope of these measures, Woodall said.

“We are halfway there so we have half way to go,” Woodall said. “The good news is more and more people who are not typically represented up in Tallahassee – black and brown people – are coming here every day, every week.”

1109,Orlando police officer accused of kicking 13-year-old in chest,"ORLANDO, Fla. - An Orlando police officer hailed as a hero the night of the Pulse Nightclub shooting is now accused of kicking a 13-year-old boy during a violent takedown.

According to an internal affairs report, Officer Neal Chase was one of several officers who responded to Jackson Street in downtown Orlando last May after residents complained vehicles were being burglarized.

One of the suspects, a 13-year-old, was spotted at the corner of Eola Drive and Pine Street, and, according to the report, that's where Officer Chase encountered him.

""Police K-9, stop running or I will release my dog, and you will get bit,"" Chase was reportedly heard saying on body worn cameras.

The report said the man went down to his knees, and he told him to get all the way down onto the ground.

""The male ignored his command and refused to lay down,"" the report stated. ""Officer Chase continued to approach the man who refused his lawful order and kicked him once in the chest with his left foot.""

According to the report, Chase weighed between 200 and 249 pounds, and the teenager weighed 130 pounds.

The teen fell onto his back, according to the report, and he was secured in handcuffs.

An ambulance was called after he started complaining of pain.

During the following internal investigation, Chase offered his side of what happened in the report:

""My thought was to kick him... with the intent to make him fall back... to secure him... as easy as possible, as fast as possible in order to be able to continue.. attempting to search for the second suspect.""

Despite that, the Orlando Police Department Office of Internal Affairs sustained allegations Chase violated department procedures.

According to records, he was given a 16-hour suspension; his appeal was rejected.

The Fraternal Order of Police told News 6 the case is not over.

Chase's case is headed to arbitration.

A spokesperson for the police union said they want the department's expert on use of force to be able to review the body worn camera and determine if Chase did anything wrong.

The arbitration process will likely take about a year.

1112,Mother to be released from jail after son nearly drowns in hot tub,"DAYTONA BEACH SHORES, Fla. - A mother accused of child neglect after her son nearly drowned in a hot tub appeared before a judge on Tuesday.

Apryl Connolly, 36, was released on her own recognizance.

Daytona Beach Shores Public Safety Department credits the clerk at Perry's Ocean Edge Resort who saw the drowning 3-year-old boy on surveillance cameras and alerted a maintenance worker. Hotel guest Brittany Fishel also helped with the rescue.

""I'm a nurse, so I have a duty to involve myself in something like that,"" Fishel said. ""I would never walk away from a situation like that without knowing that everything is OK down there.""

Fishel said one minute she saw the twin boys from her balcony and the next she only saw one. She immediately yelled for the maintenance worker who was clearing out the hot tub and shutting it off to check for the toddler in the water.

""I could not believe that nobody noticed this child and I didn't know at the time that the resort worker had been watching this on surveillance the whole time,"" Fishel said.

The maintenance man jumped in, rescued the child and performed CPR. The child's father also helped with CPR before Fishel rushed in to take over.

""Eventually, he did come around as I was doing CPR, started breathing on his own and started crying. Paramedics showed up and took over,"" she said.

Connolly appeared before a judge who found enough evidence to charge her with child neglect and tampering with evidence after police said she discarded pills while people were trying to save her son.

Fishel said it was a hard experience as she thought of her own children that night and recommends everyone should learn CPR.

""That plays a huge role. I mean, every second counts,"" she said.

Police said the toddler is expected to recover and will be released from the hospital on Wednesday.

1116,Grandmother arrested after 6-year-old found wandering neighborhood,"ST. JOHNS, Fla. - A grandmother was arrested after her 6-year-old grandson was found wandering along a street after she left him home alone, according to the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office.

Michelle Leblanc, 48, was supposed to be babysitting her grandson, deputies said. A neighbor found the boy crying and wandering around the Southern Creek subdivision Sunday.

According to the arrest report, Leblanc eventually came speeding down a road, nearly hitting a patrol cruiser. When she got out of the car, deputies said the grandmother’s eyes were bloodshot, her speech was slurred and she smelled of alcohol.

Leblanc told deputies she had consumed three mimosas, the report said, and that the drinks affected her “more than other people.” Investigators found a tumbler in her cup holder filled with an orange liquid that smelled like alcohol.

During the ride to jail, the grandmother screamed and cursed at a deputy before she began speaking in a “soft, sultry and seductive voice,” the report said. She told a deputy, “I love cops. All you have to do is say yes. Turn around and take me home. I would do anything to make it worth your while.”

Records show Leblanc was freed from jail Monday afternoon after posting bond. She was charged with child neglect, resisting an officer and DUI.

According to the Sheriff’s Office, Leblanc has two past convictions for DUI for incidents that occurred in Broward County. The first offense occurred in 1996, and the other happened a year later.

A spokesperson said the Department of Children and Families is investigating.

1117,Boy Scouts test Imperial River waters on homemade kayaks,"CLOSE Boy Scouts from Troop 109 launched their homemade kayaks that they've been working on since September into the Imperial River in Bonita Springs on Sunday, March 24. Alex Driehaus, Naples Daily News

The relatively calm docks along the Imperial River echoed with laughs and volleys from squirt guns as 27 Boy Scouts from Troop 109 tested their homemade kayaks for the first time.

The youngsters dropped into the serene waters from Riverside Park in downtown Bonita Springs on Sunday. Their collapsible kayaks were held together with wood, canvas, glue and elbow grease.

“This was supposed to be a three-weekend project,” Scoutmaster Mark Cecil said. “It turned into a four-month marathon.”

Between adults cutting wood bases and all the gluing and painting, each kayak took about 30 hours to finish.

But they needed a good test, and what better than the local river. Scouts jumped into their kayak and slipped into the dark waters. Not one kayak had a leak.

Each kayak was the same design for simplicity’s sake. The Scouts, who ranged in age from 12 to 18, might have come up with some ingenious, yet unsuccessful, kayak designs. Adult supervisors wanted everyone to have everyone float.

Races began after a group photo in the water.

“No hitting each other’s boats or slapping with paddles,” said 14-year-old Kristian Hustrulid, the troop senior patrol leader.

The two dozen kayakers ignored the advice after the starting whistle rang. The group started at the old railroad bridge and raced to the Old 41 Road bridge.

Kristian’s brother Stefan, paddling a banana-yellow kayak and sporting a tricorn pirate hat, won the first race. Only a little water sloshed in the kayak’s bottom.

“The water is only from the paddle splashes from the others,” Stefan said. “(The kayak) handles really well.”

The square-ish boats were shorter and squatter than normal kayaks, helping them turn easily in the calm river waters.

The control came at a cost. The boats’ instability was clear as the Scouts pushed and shoved each other into the water on the way back to shore. Nearly everyone in the boats and on shore held a squirt gun, only adding to the water-filled chaos.

Troopers personalized the boats with paint. The S.S. Goofball was near the top of the leaderboard. Many kayaks had racing stripes that surely made them faster.

Members of Troop 109 are a “water tribe,” Cecil said. They spend most of their time on the water. Their last trip was to Panther Key, more than 10 miles away from Marco Island in the Ten Thousand Islands.

1120,Florida 'Supermom' dedicated life to kids. Now they're out to honor hers.,"Marie Ambroise of Delray Beach was fatally hit by a work van driven by a disgruntled handyman. He's facing second-degree murder charges.

DELRAY BEACH — When Marie Ambroise sat down to see a film a few years ago, she turned to her daughter and said that was the first time she had been to a movie theater.

Ambroise spent decades working jobs that never paid more than $11 an hour to cover the mortgage on her Delray Beach home, support her three children and put them through college.

Simply put, Ambroise was “Supermom,” her youngest daughter Nutrishia Pardieu said.

Now Ambroise’s children are doing their best to honor the woman who dedicated her life to giving them better than what she had.

Ambroise, 59, died March 1 from injuries sustained when a disgruntled handyman ran over her and Pardieu outside their home in the Delray Shores neighborhood. Elson Silencieux, 39, of Boynton Beach drove off, but Boynton police found him in his damaged work van soon afterward. Silencieux faces second-degree murder, hit-and-run and aggravated battery charges and remains in the Palm Beach County Jail.

Pardieu said she and her family are scrambling to come up with the money to pay for Ambroise’s homegoing service, which is scheduled for Sunday. Her longtime friend, Pukatteo Laguerre, set up a GoFundMe page online to help offset the costs.

Pardieu has been living in her childhood home while she pursues a Master of Business Administration from Lynn University. At the end of the month, she will move out of her mother’s house so she can rent it to cover the cost of the mortgage. She plans on continuing classes but will need to find a job while she does.

Pardieu said she hasn’t even considered her own medical costs. Without insurance, she’s paid for treatment for a broken collarbone, cuts and open wounds out of pocket, she said.

“Even if I have to go into debt, I don’t mind,” Pardieu said. “I just want to make sure my mom, the last time I see her, she’s beautiful. I just want to honor her.”

Ambroise planned to spend her later years being a foster mother and opening the hair salon and beauty supply store of which she’d dreamed.

“This was the year. You don’t understand: My whole life I’ve been hearing about this hair salon, this hair salon, this hair salon. I’m 28,” Pardieu said. “And this year it was finally going to happen.”

Ambroise did hair professionally in Haiti but gave it up in the early 1980s when she moved with her young family to Delray Beach. She and her husband at the time bought the home on Angler Drive had had their second child while living there. Then Ambroise decided to go to cosmetology school, and she finished when she was pregnant with Pardieu.

As her kids grew, Ambroise set up a makeshift salon in their Delray Beach home. Laguerre, Pardieu’s longtime friend and classmate at Atlantic High School, remembers spending hours watching Ambroise do perms, braids and coloring. Laguerre recalled that Ambroise would stop to explain to her daughters and their friends what she was doing.

Laguerre laughed remembering Pardieu’s fears of being the only child in the home when her older sister left for college.

“Stop acting like you’re gonna be so lonely,” Laguerre told her. The home was a gathering place.

That was how Ambroise liked it.

She spent the last few years preparing for her house to be a home for foster children. She took classes, bolstered her savings and eagerly awaiting her first placement.

“You guys won’t give me any grandkids, I’m gonna get some myself,” Pardieu recalled her mother saying to her brother, sister and her.

Ambroise got the call last month: three young siblings. Hers would be the first home they lived in together.

The youngest, a toddler, was by Ambroise’s side the evening of March 1 when the argument with Silencieux over an incomplete handyman job began. Pardieu said she ushered the little boy inside with his siblings, the oldest only 6.

They continued the disagreement outside the home.

Pardieu explained that a friend had referred her mother to Silencieux last month to fix Ambroise’s ceiling, which had been damaged by a leak. On Feb. 24 and 25, Silencieux worked on resurfacing ceilings in two rooms. When he left that Monday evening, Ambroise realized the electricity in those rooms was not working. She called Silencieux early the next morning to ask when he’d be back to finish the ceilings and to repair power to the home, Pardieu said.

They didn’t have air-conditioning, hot water or cable.

Silencieux said he would be there after he finished another job, but three days and many ignored messages later, he still hadn’t returned.

>>MORE Delray woman, alleged attacker argued over payment

When Silencieux showed up that Friday evening, he demanded Ambroise pay him the remaining $80 she owed him for the job. She already had paid him hundreds, Pardieu said, and was upset by how unprofessional and inept his work had been.

Ambroise told Silencieux she only had $26 on her and advised that he take it to buy a part he claimed to need. She told him he would call the police if he didn’t leave.

The mention of police set him off, Pardieu said. He hit Ambroise and then Pardieu when she intervened. A neighbor told police he saw Silencieux punch both women. Pardieu said he appeared to be smiling as he hit them and threw things toward them.

When he stormed off to his work van, the women followed. They wanted to write down his license plate number.

Pardieu told police Silencieux tried to rip the plate off the van. That didn’t work, so he jumped in the van and allegedly reversed into Ambroise.

Pardieu said she didn’t realize her mother had been hit by the van until she saw her slippers off her feet. She told police Silencieux backed over her mother twice. A neighbor told authorities he saw Ambroise pinned under the van as the wheels spun in place.

“He purposely was running over my mom,” Pardieu said. “I don’t even think he was sad when he was doing it.”

Pardieu rushed in front of Silencieux’s van, trying to stop him, but he hit her, too. Her next memory, she told police, was waking up in a bed at Delray Medical Center. Ambroise died there about an hour after she was hit.

The public defender representing Silencieux did not responded to an email requesting comment on the case.

Pardieu stressed that their mother never would have allowed Silencieux in their home if she had known about allegations of past violence.

Court records indicate that in 2015, Silencieux allegedly chased his ex-girlfriend and her family with a machete while threatening to kill them. He was arrested on an aggravated-assault charge, which was later dropped. He pleaded guilty in 2010 to burglarizing a Lake Worth home. He’s also faced car theft, drug, burglary and driving-related charges, Palm Beach County court records dating back to 2004 show.

“I keep thinking about that, ‘What could I have done to avoid it?’ ,” Pardieu said about the fatal confrontation. “It really doesn’t make sense at all.”

MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. - A school bus assistant yelled at a student to remove a red Make America Great Again hat, then grabbed it off the teen’s head, video shows.

Gunnar Johansson, 14, wore the hat as part of a March of Dimes fundraiser that allowed students to wear a hat of their choice for making a donation, WPTV reported.

The school bus aide, who has not been identified, tells Johansson to put the hat in his backpack and repeatedly tells him to remove it.

“Boy, if you don’t take that hat off this bus… take it off. Take that hat off… take that hat off…” she is heard saying in the video.

“She, like, threatened me with a referral and threatened to turn the bus around. I said ‘write me up, I didn’t do anything wrong,’ and then she yanked my hat off. It was crazy,” Johansson told WPTV.

He rode the rest of the way to school without wearing the hat.

His mother heard about the incident and immediately drove to the school and spoke with administrators, WPTV reported.

The district is aware of the family’s allegations,” Frank Frangella, Director of Safety and Security for the Martin County School District, told WPTV. “We’re taking it very seriously. We’re in the process of gathering all the facts right now.”

The school district does not have a policy regarding wearing political attire.

1128,Racing to keep a promise to homeless families,"Sarasota faith-based group Family Promise makes final effort at a fresh start

A few years ago, one exasperated mother going through a local support program for homeless families told a volunteer, ""You don't know what it's like.""

""I smiled,"" the volunteer remembers. ""And I said, 'Sometimes I don’t. Everybody’s situation is a little bit different — so when I was in the program, it was probably a different experience.' And I walked away.""

The volunteer watched as this mother talked to another, and the second mother approached to ask if it were true.

""You don’t look like you were in the program,"" she said dubiously.

""But what does being homeless look like?"" the volunteer asks now. ""You got into a bad situation one way or another, and you needed a stepping stone; that's all.""

The client-turned-volunteer, so grateful for her own stepping stone that she now serves on the board of Family Promise of Sarasota, gives her name simply as Monika. Tall and ballerina-graceful, dressed in the medical scrubs she wears to the job she's held for five years, she has left hardship behind and is saving to buy a home. And she apologizes repeatedly for not wanting her last name or photo in the newspaper.

""I want to change the stigma surrounding homelessness; I do,"" she says. ""But I also don’t want to be the pioneer.""

Still, she feels obligated to bear witness to the transformative power of Family Promise, because the future of this interfaith Sarasota program is in doubt. In December 2017, after 12 years of offering sanctuary and stability to families in search of housing, the local operation abruptly shut down.

A new board of trustees has worked since then to reorganize and rebuild. But if it fails to enlist the necessary number of local congregations over the next few weeks, says president Doug Francis, ""We will be forced to close our ministry.""

On safe ground

Just as every story of homelessness is one-of-a-kind, the many causes of homelessness in America call for tailor-made solutions.

Over the last three decades, some proven methods have emerged to deal with chronic homelessness, with its chicken-and-egg cycle of mental illness and substance abuse. Other approaches have tackled situational homelessness — the string of bad luck that puts someone on the street who wouldn't otherwise be there.

Family Promise, a successful national model started in 1986, is a faith-based ""hospitality network"" targeting the unique needs of parents and children who are struggling to stay together as they find their way back to solvency.

Here's how it works: Over an average stay of about two months, a family spends one week at each place of worship that serves as a host, moving every Sunday to another one. Each host congregation takes in two families at a time, for one week every three months. The families may sleep on cots at night in what becomes a classroom or meeting hall by day. Each morning they tidy up, and the parents may look for jobs or housing while the children go to school or day care. Everyone comes back together at dinnertime.

Members of the congregation take turns bringing meals to the family, making sympathetic conversation, even helping the kids with homework. While receiving shelter that is free and safe, the parents also get help finding work and a permanent place to live. When a family ""graduates"" from the program, another takes its place.

The payoffs of this arrangement for guest families are clear: food, clothing, shelter, guidance — and the important gift of time while they figure out their next steps. But volunteers report that what they get in return is invaluable: a chance to see the world through troubled eyes, and a chance to make that world a little better.

First Presbyterian Church of Sarasota's pastor, Glen Bell, notes that parishioners who are easily moved to compassion for a homeless person, but may not feel safe approaching strangers in public, embrace the opportunity to extend hospitality on the familiar ground where they worship.

He describes Family Promise as a way for congregation members ""to serve Christ by ministering to those in need, and step outside of their own circles to be face-to-face with folks they’d never meet any other way. These days, so many people live in gated communities, and they’re separated by their politics and their socioeconomic levels.""

Joyce Brandt, a retired nurse who serves as the Family Promise coordinator at Pine Shores Presbyterian Church, says that taking in families came naturally to her as a mother.

""All of my children live out of town,"" she says. ""I would want somebody to help my children if they were in a position of being homeless. As people age, they want to continue to give, to be able to help people. At my church, people keep asking me, 'When is Family Promise starting up again?'""

Not too comfortable

It's a good question, says Francis, the board president. A 20-year Sarasota resident who retired from the pharmaceutical industry, he learned about Family Promise through his wife's committee work at St. Boniface Episcopal Church.

""I knew right away this was a concept worth saving,"" Francis says. ""We are 80 percent successful in finding folks jobs and housing, in about 65 days on average — at almost no cost, since our congregation volunteers supply the shelter and the food.""

Family Promise succeeds where other programs fail, Francis explains, because guest families are chosen carefully to make sure they're motivated and capable of changing their lives. Once accepted, they are made welcome — but never allowed to become so comfortable that they lose the desire to find a home of their own.

Monika, the former guest who now works with Francis on the board, laughs when asked about the program's rigor.

""Once a week you meet with your caseworker, who will look at your financials,"" she says. ""The program wants to know that whatever money you’re spending is for things you’ve already disclosed, like a car payment. I remember on one of our moves we lost a hairbrush. This was the second hairbrush. So the caseworker said, 'Why are you constantly buying these hairbrushes?' I asked her, 'Do you know what it’s like to move once a week?'

While she and her daughter always felt safe and supported, Monika says, there wasn't much privacy — or much leisure time.

""If you wake up on a Saturday and you feel like lying on your bed, well, you can’t do that,"" she says. ""There are responsibilities; your space needs to be cleaned.""

Where Family Promise of Sarasota went wrong, Francis says, was in departing from this tested formula. The program received ""a blessing that turned out to be a downfall"" — the use of a separate house on church property where families had more elbow room. With less of an incentive for guests to move on, Francis says, the rhythm was disrupted and inertia set in. Some congregations, disenchanted, dropped out entirely.

The reconstituted board, Francis says, has been working for about a year to engage both host congregations — those who offer shelter on their grounds — and support congregations, whose members bring meals and fellowship to other sites. In that time, nine new religious organizations have joined the eight that remained of the original participants.

""We are very encouraged about our progress,"" he says. ""Several of our host congregations have offered their facilities for other congregations to use — as long as the weeks are managed by the other support congregation volunteers. We could use a couple more host congregations and several more support congregations. We are so very close.""

But a deadline looms. During Easter Week observances, Francis says, most congregations become consumed with their own activities — and after that, many worshipers depart for summer homes. The 10 trustees of Family Promise have agreed, he says, that this is their final attempt to achieve the momentum it will take to restart their mission.

Any local congregations interested in being part of the revival, he says, can contact him by ""e-mail, phone, or a knock on my door. I will respond with joy.""

A place for families

The Sarasota affiliate is one of more than 200 members of the Family Promise network that has assisted more than 825,000 individuals, nearly two-thirds of them children. Ellen McLaughlin, the director of Schoolhouse Link — a Sarasota YMCA agency that works with the public school system to support homeless families, said she ""would love for them to reopen. Our community certainly needs their services.""

It was Monika's inability to register her 6-year-old daughter for school — because she didn't have an address — that led her to Family Promise in the summer of 2013. The two had driven to Sarasota from Las Vegas to join her husband, whose new job here fell through before it began. He hadn't wanted to tell her, she says, while they were on the road.

""I had a few thousand dollars saved up, but I thought that was going to our rent,"" Monika recalls. ""It ended up being hotel rooms, car payments, car insurance.""

She landed a job as a receptionist, but it paid $12 an hour — not enough to put her family on their feet.

""I called 211, Salvation Army, anybody and everybody I could think of,"" she says. Resurrection House gave her a voucher for a week's stay at a North Tamiami Trail motel: ""I moved a towel and a roach fell on me, and then I opened the refrigerator and five more came out.""

The refusal to let her daughter sign up for first grade, she says, felt like an unsustainable blow.

""I went to church and I was sobbing,"" Monika says. Someone there placed a call to Family Promise.

""It definitely sounded so much safer,"" she says. ""I couldn’t imagine having to walk into the Salvation Army shelter with my daughter. It's not a place for families. If you’ve got a 13-year-old boy and you’re a single mom, that boy is considered a man. You’re separated from your 13-year-old son, in a shelter where there’s probably 200 people.""

But as a guest in the program, ""you feel like you’re with your family,"" she adds. ""All the volunteers go out of their way to make you feel like you’re welcome. It’s not just, 'Here’s your meal.' They sit down and eat with you. Being new to Florida, I had people volunteer to tutor my daughter, help drive us; they were always there. They managed to make a really bad situation bearable.""

Nearly six years later, Monika is a single mother with a solid job, monitoring the housing market for a good time to buy. Her daughter, she says, only dimly remembers those months when they camped out at one fellowship hall after another.

""She turned 7 when we were there,"" Monika says. ""When we drove by a church one day, she said 'Hey, they had my birthday there.' She remembers the volunteer who brought her the cookie cake.""",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190331/racing-to-keep-promise-to-homeless-families?rssfeed=true,2019-03-31T03:48:00Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

INDIANTOWN — A woman was accused of neglecting a dog to the point where he died, as well as leaving two other dogs without clean food or water.

Priscilla Smith, 35, of the 14700 block of Southwest 175th Court, was charged with tormenting, depriving, killing or mutilating an animal and two counts of abandoning or confining an animal without food, water or exercise.

Deputies said on March 19 they assisted Animal Control and found a male pit bull hanging from a tree in Smith's backyard.

Sheriff's deputies said they also found two female dogs tied to a shed in Smith's backyard. The dogs had several open wounds, were covered in fleas and did not have access to water or clean food, deputies said.

A bowl of water filled with algae was found in the yard, along with a bowl of old food covered with flies.

On March 20 deputies met with Smith who told them she was out of town the week before and had left a family member in charge of taking care of the dogs.

That relative told deputies he had routinely fed the dogs. Deputies said they thought it was questionable that the dogs had been fed. No charges were filed against the relative.

Active shooter training was off base

“Shocking” is about the only accurate concept used by guest columnist Bill Mick in his March 24 comments about Indiana teachers involved in active shooter training.

Mr. Mick mistakenly believes that having deputies portraying active shooters and taking shots with airsoft pellets at teachers is needed for realistic training. He claims teachers are whining about this, and jumps to a totally inaccurate and unsubstantiated conclusion that, “... hope for protecting our kids is lost ... on teachers anyway.”

I am a military veteran and a former trainer/participant in combat survival and active shooter drills — both classroom and field exercises. Receiving training is about learning and improving. A basic logical premise that all good training programs follow is that you do not need to “practice bleeding."" As a former police officer, Mr. Mick should definitely know this.

Thoughts and concepts concerning potential life-threatening situations in varying environments are accurately explained, and better comprehended, with calm and measured instruction beginning with a statement such as, ""This will be a difficult situation and panic and uncertainty will probably ensue. Experience has shown that this is the best method of proceeding and this is the thought process you should try to follow.”

Mr. Mick is entitled to his opinion. He is absolutely wrong, however, if he believes raising welts on teachers makes for an effective active shooter training scenario.

How can there be obstruction here?

I'm just a simple farming man down here on the south beaches of Brevard. Spend most of my days tending the fields but I do occasionally hear about the activities of the high and mighty in government and the media.

I have heard some about the Trump/Russian conspiracy to steal Ms. Clinton's ascension to the throne. Now that Mr. Mueller found there was no Trump-Russia conspiracy, I just can't understand why there is any concern about obstruction of justice. How can you obstruct justice if no crime was committed? What are the power elites and pundits alleging? Trump and his associates got together and decided not to talk about and then cover up a crime that didn't happen?

I do admit I'm a simple country boy, but I'm starting to think there are a lot of people in power who got me beat in simple.

Floridians and climate change

When it comes to climate change, it will take strong national action to slow down this scourge. The March 24 article ""The floods are coming; here's what we can do"" provides a perspective of how climate change is already impacting areas in our nation.

Floridians know that our cities are in particular danger due to their low elevation relative to rising sea levels and increased hurricane activity. We need Congress to take action on climate change to slow down its impacts and to buy time for deployment of new innovations.

A key component of this change is recognizing the need to limit CO2 emissions. Currently there is a bipartisan legislation proposed in Congress, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, HR 763. It is being lobbied hard by regular unpaid volunteer citizens through the Citizens Climate Lobby, which I encourage you to Google. The legislation is revenue-neutral in that fees on carbon emissions go directly to citizens, not to increasing size of the government. It is geared to encourage the development and deployment of climate friendly energy sources. The legislation is also expected to add over 2 million jobs and will reduce carbon emissions 40 percent in the first 12 years.

I urge you to contact Rep. Bill Posey and let him know that he needs to be a part of this important bipartisan effort.

Presidential primaries need revamp

Mr. Robert Sanchez, in his recent guest opinion, is on the right track about a badly needed rearrangement of primaries for presidential elections.

Political parties are legally registered entities in all states. They can dictate the rules of their membership. The RNC and DNC each represents its respective state parties. It seems in the best of each to jointly establish uniform rules for campaigning.

First, establish a date on which campaigning begins and the date on which states must hold their primary election. Clearly define “campaigning” and “exploring.” No state should have an out-front advantage. The national convention should be held 180 days after the campaign begins.

Second, violating the beginning date by any candidate should automatically reduce that state's electoral votes by half. The consequence must be meaningful, regardless of the chances of the candidate violating the rule. The party must control its candidates. (All other parties can set their own rules for campaigning.)

However, neither major party can control a pre-candidate who will be free to ""explore"" any state before declaring candidacy. Without early voting in Iowa or New Hampshire, however, any sensible candidate should prefer to ""explore"" in any of the power states.

The major parties should continue to prohibit registered independents from voting in their primaries. Those voters have chosen to remain “neutral” and allowing them to vote lets them have their cake and eat it. It’s totally illogical.

Principles are governed by the intellect, not by feelings of “fairness.”

PALM HARBOR, Fla. (WFLA) - Left alone in their Pasco County house after their owner died, two dogs are now looking for a new place to live.

Both animals suffered from depression after keeping watch over their deceased owner for at least a week. But now, their outlook is much brighter.

One of the dogs is a Great Dane name Pirate. The other is a South African Mastiff named Savvy. They've come a long way in just a short while.

The situation in Pasco is tragic. Nobody knew Pirate and Savvy’s owner had died. She was found lying on the floor with Pirate and Savvy next to her.

A family member took Pirate in, but could not take care of him. Pasco County Animal services took 10-year-old Savvy, but turned her over to the Suncoast Animal League in Palm Harbor.

“She wants to be as close to you as possible. So if someone wants a dog who just wants to love and love them and love the dog and hang out, this is the dog for them,” said foster mom Missy Hardy.

Director Rick Chaboudy said Pirate needs to gain some weight, get neutered, and will be a good companion.

“He's a good boy. And his spirits are up and he's not depressed like he was. And he knows we're just here to do him good,” he said.

Savvy ready to be adopted now. She is 10-years-old, mostly blind, and needs a special home.

Pirate should be ready to go in a few weeks.

1144,"'Lovable' Santa Rosa School Resource Officer suffers stroke at school, many come to help","Matt Robinson with his wife (far left), Tabitha, and their five children. (Photo: Courtesy of the Matt and Tabitha Robinson)

Tabitha Robinson had already received an unusual number of calls from her husband on March 12, the day after his 38th birthday. He rarely, if ever, called so many times in row while at work before, but her phone rang again.

The first time Matt Robinson called, he’d phoned to tell his wife his head felt strange.

“Do you need to go to the doctor?” she’d asked.

“No, I’ll be alright,” he’d said.

The next time he called, his words seemed slightly slurred. Then, he told his wife his arm tingled. When Tabitha Robinson answered Matt Robinson’s final call, it was incomprehensible.

The first thing Tabitha thought about was making sure Matt got to West Florida Hospital fast, and then “I worried about how we were going to pick up all the kids,” she said.

Once there, the couple learned that the Santa Rosa Sheriff’s deputy suffered a stroke while working as a school resource officer at Milton High School, losing his ability to speak.

Husband, father of five

The day of the stroke, Matt could not move his right leg, arm, hand or right foot.

Tabitha slept at the hospital that night — and every night since. It was the beginning of a long road back to recovery, one that kept Matt and Tabitha away from their five children in Holley-Navarre.

“We have seen them three or four times since the 12th,” Tabitha said.

Their oldest is their 18-year-old daughter and their youngest, a 2-year-old boy.

“The girls are old enough to understand that he is ‘sick,’” she wrote in a text message. “The 2-year-old boy, he doesn’t understand where mommy and daddy are.”

Matt coaches their 6-year-old’s T-ball team, said Matt's mother, Kathy Robinson.

Support from the community

But despite the hardships, the family is receiving an outpouring of support.

“The sheriff's office have been phenomenal,” Kathy said. “The night that it happened, I have never seen so many police officers in one place.”

She added that her son’s boss, Santa Rosa Sheriff Bob Johnson, beat the ambulance to the hospital, and several deputies have shared their allotted sick days with Matt.

One sheriff deputy, Kathy said, decided to split all his overtime pay with Matt and his family while Matt remains off-duty.

Spokesman for the Santa Rosa Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Rich Aloy said “‘Loveable’ is a great way to describe him.”

This is Matt’s eighth year as a sheriff’s deputy. He’s spent five years as a school resource officer. Matt patrolled the halls of Navarre High School for one year and spent the last your years detailed to Milton High School.

“If you tried to create in your mind the perfect school resource officer, you could do no better,” said Milton High School Assistant Principal Chad Rowell. “He recognizes human need.

“And, he connects with kids on a level that is trying to grow the child, even when they are in trouble.”

Regaining control of his body

Everyone — at work, school and home — are looking forward to Matt's return.

His condition has vastly improved and did so relatively quickly.

The day after the stroke, Matt regained some control of his right leg. Two days after, he was able to once again move his right arm. Before long Matt and a rehabilitation specialist started working on fine motor skills.

Doctors told Kathy that stroke victims don't actually “lose” their capacities for speech.

“It’s like a spark plug that isn’t connecting yet,” Kathy said. “It’s misfiring.”

How’s Matt doing with talking, now?

“His speech, well, anybody could understand him now,” his mother said. “He sounds like somebody who has a cold.”

A GoFundMe page has been created to fundraiser for Matt and Tabitha’s family while the two parents remain out of work.

1146,South Florida Museum bids farewell to Jeff Rodgers,"South Florida COO and provost Jeff Rodgers is taking a new job after 15 years at SFM. He looks back on more than a decade of growth and innovation

BRADENTON — Some 30 million years ago, when the plains of Nebraska were dense with forests, a carnivore called hoplophoneus, distinguished by its curved upper canines, likely preferred the ambush to the chase when it came to modes of attack.

Also known as the false sabre-tooth cat, it had stubby legs ill-suited for pursuing quarry in the open ranges those badlands would become as the climate shifted and the woods disappeared. The thick-bodied, proto-feline would “hit an evolutionary dead end” and go the way of dinosaurs, recalls Jeff Rodgers, the outgoing provost and chief operating officer of the South Florida Museum in Bradenton.

The exotic hoplophoneus skull is one of Rodgers’ favorite personal finds, but he’ll leave it behind on display when he becomes executive director of the 100-year-old Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on April 1.

After 15 years of serving SFM in various roles, the 51-year-old educator applauds the bright prospects for the institution he helped guide well into the 21st century. Secrets concealed in Earth’s geological strata, the mysteries of interstellar debris scattered at creation’s big bang, the life and death of a feline species whose remains have turned to stone — Rodgers says SFM is on the brink of taking its strongest suit, storytelling, to an uncharted level.

When the 3,290 square foot Mosaic Backyard Universe and its 16,000 square foot North Education Center host a grand opening in July, the $9 million project will offer a one-of-a-kind challenge for visitors, particularly kids, to re-examine nature beneath the architecture of the solar system.

“There’s nothing like it, so there’s no example that you can point to,” Rodgers says. “We’ve looked at education models like Montessori, and other sorts of learning opportunities in Europe, where play and outdoor learning are important. What we wanted to do was combat the testing-based environment, where there’s not a lot of room for kids to freely explore things they’re interested in because it’s not on a test. You’ve got to create opportunities for people to continue engaging with their environment.”

Rodgers got his first lesson on those missing links more than a quarter century ago.

Hired as SFM’s director of education shortly after his previous employer, the Children’s Science Center in Cape Coral, was ravaged in 2004 by Hurricane Charley, the Long Island native had been a history/political science major before his designs on law school were derailed by a career detour into the American Museum of Natural History and its Hayden Planetarium.

During his nine years working and studying at one of America’s vanguard educational institutions, Rodgers took note of a peculiarity: scientists rarely conversed with researchers outside their own disciplines. But he had an epiphany in 1995. That’s when astronomers confirmed the existence of the first extrasolar planet, a Jupiter-sized world orbiting a Sun-like star more than 50 light years away.

“And that, in my mind, began to fuse all of these different sciences together,” he remembers. “We actually got another planet to study. What do we know about how it formed? How can we learn what that planet’s like? How do we figure out if there could be life on that planet? If there is life, how might that planet evolve? What do we know about our own planet that could teach us those things?

“Astrobiology really brought all those sciences together in a unified way.”

Destroyed by an electrical fire in 2001, the 50-year-old Bishop Planetarium was a year away from reopening when Rodgers was hired in 2004. Once the Bishop went back online, Rodgers became its director, and his vision for unifying SFM’s disparate displays and programs took off.

“The South Florida Museum already had promise. It had the fossils, it was focusing on the life sciences and the biodiversity of Florida. And it had the human stories in there as well,” he says. “But the planetarium was the biggie. It became a powerful way for us to reinterpret the way we thought about the museum, above and beyond just local history.

“We took away that three-headed monsterishness that we had, of what are you? Are you a planetarium, are you a museum? Are you an aquarium? No. We’re all those things, but they’re all a part of one bigger story.”

A key element was the addition of Digistar 3-D screen projection technology in 2013. Whether tracking the Voyager probes’ divergent escape routes from the solar system or charting ocean currents with real-time satellite updates, a virtual tour of almost anywhere in the mapped cosmos is just a mouse toggle away. But as Rodgers is quick to point out, technology and knowledge are hardly synonymous.

“The most powerful tool that humans have is the ability to communicate ideas,” he says. “That’s what makes us human. And I used to think, as information became widely and freely available, that groups of people who shared similar interests would be able to communicate more effectively.” And it has; only, with epidemic tendencies toward confirmation bias and echo-chamber misinformation. “I look back now and I think boy, that was naïve. The internet has pointed out some real challenges for us.”

Among the Museum’s efforts to nudge locals away from their keyboards and into broader perspectives are speaker presentations like Stelliferous Live and Think and Drink, conducted in relaxed settings.

“I’ve kind of staked our museum ground in the idea that we need places where people can come together and examine the ideas they’re finding out about, and talk with folks who know something about these ideas from a scientific perspective. And the beauty of a ‘Think and Drink’ is, it was always designed to be a conversation. The idea was never supposed to be a lecture, it was , hey, we have some ideas, let’s have a conversation about it.”

Over the past 15 years, one of most evolving conversations has centered on climate change.

“And the success we’ve had is being able to pull up the data, through visualizations. It’s not just a hockey-stick graph,” he says. “We can visualize those changes through animation on the globe so you can see them. Hey, let’s take not just a look at this rock and see the story it has to tell us, or look at what these fossil records have to say, but let’s take a look at the last 40 years of sea surface ocean temperature change and see what that says. And let’s put the carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere up there on the board and let’s see how those correlate.

“Those types of interactions have changed minds. I’ve seen it bring people back around to say, you know, I’ve not seen this information presented in this way, or I haven’t seen this at all before. Maybe I’ll go back and take another look.”

Rodgers’ low point? Easy. The accidental, maintenance-related drowning death of Snooty, just one day after the 69th birthday of the world’s oldest known manatee, in 2017. “If there was one day in my life,” he says, unable to complete a sentence. “If it could’ve gone differently … that’s the day.”

Rodgers’ new gig at the Berkshire will complete a longstanding desire to return to the northeast, where he hopes to rebuild community confidence in a museum that has endured a recent row of controversy. In order to raise badly needed revenue, the Berkshire recently sold off more than $50 million worth of artwork, including two original pieces by Norman Rockwell, who lived in nearby Stockbridge.

For SFM chief executive officer Brynne Anne Besio, who has overseen the Museum’s growth since 2007, Rodgers leaves behind a solid foundation. Whether or how his position will be filled remains to be seen.

“Jeff is a gifted educator and communicator, as you know,” Besio says. “Communication is critical, because people come to us to help them interpret the world around them. Fortunately, he and I have hired a great staff and we’ll continue to tell the great stories.”

One thing Rodgers hopes to take with him is a professional relationship with entrepreneur/paleontologist Jim Toomey, whose Foundation for the Natural Sciences has enabled scores of local teachers to explore fossil quarries in Nebraska over the past decade and bring those experiences into classrooms.

“Jim said he’d be happy to extend the lease up to Massachusetts. He loves sharing his love of paleontology to anyone who might be interested,” Rodgers says. “The more the merrier is the way he looks at it.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190311/south-florida-museum-bids-farewell-to-jeff-rodgers?rssfeed=true,2019-03-11T09:54:56Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236
1147,Florida county deals with spate of dog attacks,"GAINESVILLE — Dog bites are fairly common in Alachua County, but the severity of the attacks in a series of recent maulings, including the death of a toddler Friday, is unprecedented — at least in recent decades.

Starting with Bella and her owner Linda Swinburn in September, the attacks have killed one person, injured four people, and killed three dogs and a cat.

In another case, a boy riding his bike in northwest Gainesville was injured when a dog got out of its house down the street, attacking him and killing a cat.

The attacking dogs in all of the cases have or will be euthanized by Alachua County Animal Services. Until Friday’s case, all of the recent attacks have occurred when dogs got loose from their property.

Some procedures were changed after Bella’s case to provide improved response and investigation of dog attacks but the Feb. 26 mauling at Palmetto Villas that left Lorraine Anderson with a severed ear, among other wounds, and her chihuahua Tico dead, shows that gaps exist.

The dogs that attacked her had gotten loose from their yard the day before and threatened a woman in the complex’s laundry room. She grabbed a pole in case they went for her, but the dogs ran off.

A Gainesville Police officer went to the house, saw that a table was covering a hole in the wooden fence and left without reporting the incident to Alachua County Animal Services.

“What could be different is the way we train people to think about pets. This officer who had gone to the house ... the (owner) needs to know that a 100-pound dog could move that little card table,” Anderson said. “To think that (the attack) could have been prevented, God, I am a mess. I am going to have a lot of problems in the future because of this.”

Meanwhile, Swinburn said she plans to push the adoption of a version of “Fabian’s Law,” legislation in Arizona named in honor of a mauled dog that carries greater penalties for owners whose dogs get loose and attack other animals or people.

For instance, the owner of a dog that has a history of biting or is likely to endanger others faces a felony if an attack happens while the dog is at large. A person who does not take reasonable care to keep a dog from escaping faces a misdemeanor charge.

Nathaniel Pettiford, the owner of the dogs that attacked Swinburn and Bella, has been charged with animal cruelty and culpable negligence. Animal cruelty is a third-degree felony and culpable negligence is a first-degree misdemeanor.

“I want to have the same law passed for Bella,” Swinburn said in an email. “There are too many attacks in Gainesville and surrounding cities (that) nobody is taking responsibility for.

“The owners are getting away with this and the laws need to be more strict. I will take this to the legislature and state capitol for Justice For BELLA and the others who have suffered these devastating attacks!”

Alachua County commissioners and Animal Services have made changes since the Bella case to improve responses by animal officers to aggressive dog calls on weekends.

Now, GPD is considering a protocol in which the Combined Communications Center, which dispatches for the county and for GPD, would automatically notify an on-call animal services officer when it notifies GPD of an aggressive dog case, said GPD Inspector Jorge Campos.

Under current procedures, the telecommunicator asks a series of questions of people reporting aggressive dogs. The first is whether the dog is actively aggressive and endangering people.

If the dog is actively aggressive or endangering, the call is graded as a Priority 2 on the scale of 1 to 7 and law enforcement will respond quickly. If the dog is not actively aggressive or endangering, the call goes to Animal Services without law enforcement responding.

Campos said if Animal Services officers are notified for Priority 2 calls along with law enforcement, the response can be more effective.

“Right now the on-call person doesn’t come out unless we call them and say ‘You need to come out,’” Campos said. “I believe we are going to ask the communications center that if someone reports an aggressive dog, that animal control gets notified at the same time or shortly thereafter. Then animal control can at least start tracking those calls.”

Dog bites are not unusual in Alachua County — hundreds are reported to the Alachua County Health Department every year. The reports are compiled by year, but details of the circumstances of each case are not put into a database that could be queried for specifics about the case.

However, a sampling of individual reports show that many of the bites occur in the dog owner’s home or property. The victims are typically a family member or guest, and a number of the reports explain that the bite happened during play.

Dog aggression is complex and can be found in canines of all breeds, ages and genders, said Terry Curtis, a clinical behaviorist with the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine.

Whether a dog with aggressive tendencies acts on them depends on the circumstances.

“If a dog has been inside the house or in the yard for a period of time, watching people going by, that can be very threatening to the dog. So the dog gets out and it is ready to go after what it perceives as a threat,” Curtis said. “Most dogs are not attacking out of the blue. There is either a threat component to it ... or a predatory component to it. It is not going to be a dominance thing — there is no dominance from dogs to people.”

Predatory action — chasing everything that goes by — is different than acting on a perceived threat. Curtis said some dogs are hard-wired toward predatory behavior.

Pepe Peruyero is a former GPD dog handler who created J&K Canine Academy after seeing stacks of euthanized dogs on the Animal Services shelter loading dock. Many of the dogs had been relinquished because of bad behavior.

Euthanasia has since dropped dramatically at Animal Services because of increased adoptions in coordination with local rescue organizations.

A direct correlation exists between a dog’s environment and how it perceives behavior that is either acceptable, situational or impulsive, Peruyero said.

“If I encourage my dog to bark at dogs when they go by, if my dog lives in a yard that is constantly taunted by kids, if my dog is tied up on a chain or a line and is lunging all day long — the likelihood of that dog building up that aggression is greater,” Peruyero said. “If you want to have a dog, whether it’s a two-pound Yorkie or a bull mastiff, you need to care for that dog. There is a responsibility. Shade, shelter, food and water is not enough. The dog should live in an environment that is conducive to its well-being.”",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190309/florida-county-deals-with-spate-of-dog-attacks?rssfeed=true,2019-03-09T14:21:38Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748

1151,"SECRET SCARS: Mother, daughter find hope in wake of father's sex abuse","In the dark hallway outside her bedroom, a man in body armor confronted Sharon with a gun.

Arms raised in surprise and surrender, she obeyed his commands.

Keep your hands up. Go to the kitchen. Face the wall.

A helicopter churned overhead, and emergency lights flashed from the yard. Were police seeking a fugitive hiding out in the thick woods around her Edgewater home?

That illusion crumbled with the clink of handcuffs closing around her wrists and dissolved completely as agents roused her daughters, Carrie and Kylie, from their rooms and secured them beside her.

Her husband, Scott, was nowhere in sight.

Police swarmed their home, searching bedrooms and sifting through clothes strewn across the floor. What they sought, Sharon didn’t know.

She had begun to suspect that something was wrong under her roof but just beyond her field of perception. In the early morning hours of Dec. 3, 2016, her fears came into focus.

Volusia County Sheriff’s Office investigators arrested Scott, a New Smyrna Beach city maintenance worker and Boy Scout leader, for molesting, recording and sharing pornographic images of Kylie — his 14-year-old daughter.

“(My husband) was doing this and that for the community, then his dark side is exposed,” said Sharon, 57, during one of several interviews. The News-Journal changed her name and the names of her family members to protect her daughter’s identity because she is a victim of sexual abuse. “To the arresting officer I said, ‘Thank you for getting me out of that hell.’”

The disturbing details that deputies revealed to Sharon that night in the backseat of a police car shed light on the source of her suspicions and propelled her toward an uncertain future.

She would be forced to confront long-buried memories from her own traumatic childhood. She would find refuge with a close friend. She would discover that her friend, too, had survived sexual abuse, and together they would seek healing at the Volusia Rape Crisis Center.

Amidst the rising tide of the #MeToo movement — a global call to end sexual violence and support abuse victims that was sparked by a series of accusations against high-profile men — she would choose to share her story so that it might give hope to others.

But first she would have to face the truth about Kylie.

‘She wanted to protect her children’

Sheriff’s office investigator Chastity Burke was notified on Dec. 2, 2016, that her subpoena of Scott’s internet account records had been returned. She’d been up early executing a search warrant but felt compelled to go back to the office and review the files right away.

“Something in my gut told me (it was urgent),” said Burke, 40, a seven-year member of the North Florida Internet Crimes Against Children task force.

Burke started investigating Scott after the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children — a Virginia-based nonprofit that helps law enforcement nationwide to identify victims of child sexual exploitation — tipped her in late September 2016 that Scott may have uploaded to the internet several images of adult men engaged in sex acts with female children as young as 1 or 2, an arrest report shows.

[MORE: VIRGINIA NONPROFIT, VOLUSIA DEPUTIES TEAM UP TO STOP CHILD EXPLOITATION]

Scott’s subpoenaed account files contained explicit material he had emailed to others — including images of him in the nude molesting his daughter, according to the report. It was the probable cause Burke needed to arrest Scott and search his house.

The possibility that the girl was in peril prioritized the warrants, and just after 11 p.m. that same night about 30 Special Weapons and Tactics and Child Exploitation Unit agents descended on Scott’s secluded Interstate 95-adjacent property. Scott answered the door naked, Burke said.

SWAT agents scoured the house for electronic devices and secured Scott’s family while Burke questioned him outside.

He downplayed his interactions with Kylie at first.

“He said he was trying to fit her for a bra,” Burke said. But when presented with photos printed from his email account, “he confessed to having an attraction toward his children. He was trying to groom (Kylie). He was hoping she would at some point do the things he wanted her to do.”

Kylie told detectives that her dad had shown her pornography, measured her “top and bottom” and ordered her Victoria’s Secret bras and panties, but denied he had sexually abused her. She was “upset” and “overwhelmed,” investigators said. “She seemed afraid and guarded.”

Sharon acknowledged that Scott walked around the house naked and made his kids uncomfortable but said she was unaware he had done “anything inappropriate” to Kylie, Burke said.

Sharon was adamant that if Scott harmed her girls, she would leave him. “I know she wanted to protect her children,” Burke said.

Burke would spend the next year searching Scott’s 20,000-plus emails. Among them she uncovered more pornographic images of Kylie that Scott had manufactured and sent to others. No additional local victims have been identified.

Sharon and her daughters didn’t disclose many damning details, but that didn’t matter. The proof was in the pictures.

Scared silent

Skeptics may doubt Sharon’s claim that she didn’t know what was happening in her home. Some might question Kylie’s reticence with investigators and wonder why she didn’t confide in her mother.

But such scenarios are common, said Shinece Carr, director of the Volusia Rape Crisis Center. As part of SMA Healthcare, the grant-funded crisis center provides free psychotherapy, group counseling, forensic examination support and other services for victims of sexual assault.

Parents who were sexually abused as children may see their kids showing signs of abuse but assume it’s their own trauma bubbling to the surface, Carr said — or they may be in denial. “It’s kind of like they’re reliving it for themselves when it happens to their child.”

By the time of Scott’s arrest, Sharon had suppressed for four decades the sexual trauma that blinded her to Kylie’s plight.

At age 14, a live-in adult uncle “started having sex with me,” Sharon recalled. She told a friend, and word got back to her parents. “All they did was slap him on the hand and tell him to get lost.”

The untreated trauma cast a shadow over her life and influenced her behavior, she said.

She met Scott at church when she was 18 and married him four years later in February 1985. They had two children.

More than a decade into their marriage, Scott changed, Sharon said. He spent significant time watching pornography and became “sexually aggressive,” she said. “If I’d try to get away, he would grab me.”

Scott kept katana swords on his side of the bed, Sharon said, and “I was afraid one of these days he would use (one) on me.”

Kylie was born in 2002. When she reached late elementary age, Sharon sensed a shift. Kylie clung to her and didn’t want to be left alone with Scott.

“(In hindsight), I should have caught it because it was done to me,” Sharon said. “Everyone says the woman’s got to know something. I did know something, but I didn’t know what.”

Sharon made repeated attempts to connect with her daughter, but when Sharon asked if she was troubled, “(Kylie) would say, ‘No, I just want to be with you.’”

Abused children keep quiet for several reasons, Carr said. They may not know how to articulate what they’re experiencing. They might fear repercussions or blame themselves.

“Or sometimes they think that a parent may not believe them over another adult,” Carr said. And if the abuser is someone they know and love, “it makes it difficult for the child to say anything.”

Boys start speaking up around ages 12 or 13, and girls at 14 to 16, Carr said. Kylie had reached that range and — made easier by Scott’s extraction from her life — the truth started trickling out in therapy and during conversations with Sharon.

Secret scars

A vandal painted the words “child molester” on the road in front of Sharon’s home with an arrow pointing toward her tree-shrouded driveway after media outlets reported Scott’s arrest.

Kylie had no safe haven. Memories of Scott’s abuse spoiled her sacred spaces. She grew withdrawn, hid herself inside hooded jackets and her mother worried she was entertaining suicidal thoughts.

She’d been an active participant in the family’s New Smyrna Beach church, where her artistic abilities were encouraged. She sang in the choir, performed interpretive dances, acted in skits and led children’s activities at summer camp.

But Scott had molested her at church, too — in between services when no one was around, and in the sound booth before concerts, Sharon said. “It was no longer a sanctuary for her.”

Sharon needed to move her daughters out of their house but didn’t have the money. Her longtime friend, Marissa, supplied a solution.

Marissa, whose name The News-Journal has changed because she also is a sex abuse survivor, was living alone in a three-bedroom house in Edgewater. When she heard about Sharon’s situation, she didn’t hesitate. “I said, ‘That’s it. You’re moving in with me,’” Marissa said.

The Volusia Rape Crisis Center helped pay for the move and purchased Kylie a new bed.

Relocation is a little-known service the center provides, but an essential one, Carr said.

“We know we can bring you for counseling 100 times and give it to you for free,” she said. “But my counselor is not going to be able to do anything for you until you feel safe.”

As Sharon and her daughters settled in with Marissa and started therapy at the crisis center, Sharon’s childhood trauma bubbled up.

During an interview with a victim advocate, she remembered afresh the hurts she had pushed down for years — the uncle in his 30s who moved in with her family, the times he raped her and his failed plan to prostitute her. She recalled the anger she felt when her parents chose not to pursue prosecution, and how she sought sex with peers as an act of rebellion.

“It was a double whammy,” Sharon said, reckoning with her daughter’s abuse as well as her own. “This is a scar deep down inside that you can’t see. Everyone that I pass, I wonder if they’re going through the same thing I am.”

Many crisis center clients are referred by law enforcement or nurses. Some, such as Sharon and Kylie, transfer from another agency when assistance is limited due to funding. And others, like Marissa, reach out directly.

Several months after Sharon’s family moved in, Marissa was flipping through old photos and came across one that “unlocked a memory,” she said. “All of a sudden it all flooded back to me.”

Her mind flashed to a family friend molesting her in her bedroom when she was 10 years old.

“I guess I had blocked it out because you don’t want to think about that,” said Marissa, 41. She panicked, and threw the picture across the room.

Her new housemates understood her pain better than most.

“I kind of curled up into myself and cried. Then (Kylie) came over and put her arms around me and said, ‘It’s OK.’ It was something she had gone through and she helped me through it.”

Trauma suppression is a safety mechanism, Carr said. “If your brain feels shutting down is the best thing for you and saves you, that’s what it’s going to do,” she said.

Something as seemingly innocuous as a fragrance, a person’s mannerisms or a spoken phrase can awaken memories of abuse many years or even decades later, Carr said.

When Marissa’s buried memories surfaced, Sharon took her to a group counseling session. There, Marissa signed up for individual therapy. And because crisis center clients can access SMA Healthcare’s mental health and substance abuse treatment services, she was able to get medication for the deep depression she’d been battling.

“It’s really, really helped me tremendously,” Marissa said. “(Without the crisis center’s help) I’ll tell you exactly where I’d be — dead.”

‘Keep healing, keep going’

Kylie looked forward to testifying at her father’s trial but she didn’t get that chance.

On Feb. 21, 2018, Scott pleaded no contest to lewd or lascivious exhibition of a child under 16, promoting the sexual performance of a child and three counts of possession of a sexual performance by a child.

He was sentenced to 20 years in state prison and registered as a sex offender. He’ll be eligible for release in 2035.

His family and Marissa say it’s not enough.

“That sentence is way too light for him, especially given the overreaching things that (Kylie) has to deal with for the rest of her life,” Marissa said.

More than two years after Scott’s arrest, Kylie has been bullied at school, is still in therapy and, her mother said, suffers from blackouts — a suppression tactic she employed during her father’s abuse.

But she’s achieved breakthroughs, too — they all have.

Marissa decided together with her crisis center therapist that she has worked through her past trauma and no longer requires counseling.

She hopes speaking out about her experience “will help other people step forward and say, ‘That happened to me, too,’ and not be ashamed,” she said. “If you can help one person, you can help many.”

Sharon’s divorce from Scott is final, and she recently received her portion of proceeds from Scott’s retirement plan and the sale of their property. She and Marissa have purchased the house they live in, a much-needed layer of stability, and Sharon has ventured back into the dating scene.

Between shifts at the retail job she's held for 20 years, she enjoys painting, photography and crafting beaded jewelry.

“I used to be cornered and fighting to get out, and (the crisis center) gave me the tools to get out,” Sharon said. “We’ve just got to keep healing, keep going.”

Helping clients gain independence is key to the crisis center’s mission, Carr said.

“I always like to tell victims that you finally found your lion inside of you,” she said. A painting of the fearsome animal hangs in her office as a reminder.

“Some have been stripped of their voice, their power,” she said. “We love to provide that safe blanket of support with different wraparound services, but we also help them find their voice, their self-esteem, to empower them.”

Kylie is a perfect example. She loved photography, and then her father took illicit pictures of her. She was interested in fashion, and he made her an unwitting model.

But the creativity that withered under Scott’s surreptitious gaze has begun to bloom again.

Kylie, now 17, plans to study sewing and fashion design at Daytona State College after she graduates high school next year. She draws dress patterns and often wears clothes she created herself. Her style has attracted some classmates’ admiration, Sharon said.

1152,"Parkland parents, teachers seek to help teens after suicides","PARKLAND, Fla. (AP) "" Days after the suicides of two student survivors of the Parkland school shooting, parents and teachers packed a town hall Wednesday night, anxiously wondering out loud how to get students to seek therapy as many have been unwilling "" despite a barrage of offerings since the 2018 massacre.

On Wednesday night, anxious parents in the standing-room only crowd spoke of fears and frustration in trying to get their children help after the Valentine's Day massacre that February, which killed 17 people.

Lissette Rozenblat recalled how her 16-year-old daughter was in the freshman building the gunman attacked.

""My daughter doesn't want to go to therapy anymore either. I have to make the appointments ... and she's like, 'oh can we reschedule',"" Rozenblat said. ""They don't want to talk about it, but we know better. Sooner or later it's going to catch up to them.""

Other parents also said they are left feeling helpless because of the difficulty of forcing kids to get help they don't want.

""My son doesn't want to discuss it at all either,"" said Joe Safonte, whose 17-year-old narrowly missed an encounter with the gunman.

His son stopped therapy after six months, saying it wasn't helping anymore, according to Safonte. But just last week, the father noted, his son was terrified when an alarm went off in their hotel room.

""Maybe it's time to go back,"" he said.

The first Parkland suicide took place March 16. Cara Aiello told WFOR-TV her 18-year-old daughter Sydney had suffered from survivor's guilt "" her friend, Meadow Pollack, died in the attack. Coral Springs police Officer Tyler Reik confirmed Monday that a Stoneman Douglas sophomore apparently killed himself Saturday, but autopsy results were pending. The boy's name was not immediately released.

A local nonprofit had planned to open a teen wellness center near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on April 30, offering free activities such as karaoke night, yoga, kickboxing and acupuncture for students who weren't interested in talking to a therapist. A wellness center, Eagle's Haven, even opened weeks ahead of schedule Monday to address emergency needs of students and their families.

""One teen just wanted to cry yesterday and didn't want to talk. Another teen wanted to tell his story about the actual shooting,"" said Julie Gordon, a licensed therapist and program director of Jewish Adoption and Family Care Options, the nonprofit behind Eagle's Haven.

Some students say they feel re-traumatized talking about the Parkland shooting. Some only want to talk to friends who were there and understand what it's like. Still others perceive a stigma around seeking help.

Shortly after the shooting, leaders in the affluent community quickly came together to offer an array of services, many free, including in-home counseling, therapy dogs and trauma techniques.

""Even though so many services have been available, it's been difficult to understand through the clutter of messaging .... there's so many options that it's hard to understand where to go,"" said Cindy Arenberg Seltzer, president of the Children's Services Council of Broward County.

She moderated the standing room only town hall Wednesday, describing how calls to a 211 helpline had been flat after the shooting.

The number of calls went up, however, after the recent suicides.

Said Seltzer, ""finally the message is breaking through.""

The recent apparent suicides of the two Parkland students and Jeremy Richman, the father of Sandy Hook victim who killed himself Monday, made national headlines, prompting fears of suicide or contagion clusters. Richman's daughter Avielle was one of 20 first-graders and six staff members fatally shot at the Connecticut elementary school six years ago.

The Florida House held a moment of silence for all three Wednesday, their names read out as part of a tribute. Gov. Ron DeSantis scheduled a last minute listening session on mental health Thursday.

Parkland leaders are working closely with those in Columbine, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut, and noted a spike in Sandy Hook first responders and survivors seeking therapy and other services "" some for the first time "" at the five-year anniversary of the attack. Experts are working to debunk the myth that time alone will heal traumas.

""The trauma will still be there, the anxiety, the flashbacks,"" Franco said. ""People kind of measure those anniversaries and say, 'OK, a year from now I'll feel better,' so the first anniversary comes and you're not feeling better, so you're feeling like it won't go away. ... There are therapeutic approaches that can really help you heal that. You don't have to live with that.""

1153,Martin County bus aide who pulled MAGA hat off student to serve a suspension without pay,"Gunnar Johansson, 14, was told by a bus aide to remove his Make America Great Again hat. (Photo: SCREENSHOT FROM WPTV)

STUART — A bus aide who removed a ""Make America Great Again"" hat from a 14-year-old student's head will serve a four-day suspension, the Martin County School Board decided Tuesday.

School district employee Delores Matheny, who was not charged with a crime related to the hat incident, will also undergo professional development training, according to a settlement agreement School Board members voted 5-0 to approve.

The MAGA hat incident, which was investigated by the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, involved Hidden Oaks Middle School student Gunnar Johansson. His mother Jacquelyn Putt reported that her son got onto a bus March 5 and Matheny grabbed his blue hat – which had “Trump” in large white letters across the front – off his head.

Deputies who investigated said students were allowed to wear a hat to school that day if they made a donation to March of Dimes.

Matheny told deputies she asked the teen to take off his ""MAGA"" hat multiple times and he refused.

She reported she then gently removed it from his head and asked him to put it in his backpack because she didn't know students were allowed to wear a hat that day.

In a statement to the Sheriff's Office, Matheny wrote she regretted what happened.

""I do not have a problem with Gunnar,"" Matheny wrote. “I am sorry for what I did, and I hope he forgives me. I overreacted.""

During Tuesday’s school board meeting, Jacquelyn Putt and her husband Michael Putt, of Palm City, urged board members not to allow Matheny to work around children.

Addressing a packed meeting room, Jacquelyn Putt said Matheny “bullied, intimidated and harassed” her son “while threatening him to take off his favorite hat on Hat Day.”

“She threatened him with a referral, threatened to turn the bus around and physically touched my son by ripping his hat off his head in front of a bus load of students wearing hats,” Putt said. “They were not made to remove their hats.”

Matheny didn’t address School Board members and she declined to comment after the meeting.

Gil Smart | You don't like Trump? It doesn't give you the right to harass his supporters

Her nephew, Jere Matheny, of Stuart, who sat among supportive family members and friends, addressed board members and flatly rejected how his aunt had been characterized by others. He described the educators, administrators and other business professionals in their family who have spent generations in Martin County.

“I hear all the cold words, ‘bullying, attacks, assault. Really what this boils down to is great political theater,” he said.

“We have a woman, who is a good woman, whose family has meant a lot to this community … we are a good family, we come from good stock and this has absolutely nothing to do with the type of mischaracterizations that some folks in this room right now are attempting to put into play,” Jere Matheny continued. “It was a mishap from a good woman and it should not mean the end of her career.”

District records show schools superintendent Laurie Gaylord concluded Matheny violated School Board policies and there was “good cause” to suspend her without pay.

In describing the incident, Gaylord wrote Matheny “admits and can be seen in the video reaching over and removing the hat from the student's head.”

Matheny then “spoke in a loud harsh tone during” her exchange with Johansson, Gaylord wrote, “and then yelled at the other students to ‘turn around and mind your own business.’”

1157,CF and government purchase Bruce Mozert's iconic photos,"'We didn’t want it sold off and split up all over the world.'

Bruce Mozert, the pioneer of underwater photography, was known more for his stunning pictures than his organization skills.

Mozert, 98, died in October 2015 and left behind a treasure trove of history in his photography studio near Silver Springs State Park.

Inside the studio, there were about a dozen of his original underwater camera housings that he used to snap his first underwater photos in Silver Springs in the 1930s.

Hundreds of decades-old prints depicting movie stars and movie sets were found stacked throughout the studio. Thousands of negatives, some from nearly 90 years ago, were found stuffed in drawers and sometimes mixed with personal vacation images.

The collection captures the days before Disney and Universal Studios, when Silver Springs was “the” tourist attraction in Florida.

Despite his iconic connection to Marion County, it was uncertain if his collection would remain here. Soon after Mozert's death, his relatives shopped the collection around, trying to find a buyer.

A local group of concerned citizens began meeting with elected officials and others to fight for the collection. Now, after more than a year of negotiations, Marion County government and the College of Central Florida have teamed with the state Division of Library and Information Services to purchase the collection from Mozert’s family for $85,000.

Lois Brauckmuller, CF spokeswoman, said the state paid $42,500 to the family and guaranteed that all of his negatives would be digitally archived. The county and the college each paid $21,250 and can access the digital archive to make prints. The equipment will be stored in Tallahassee and displayed when needed.

Michelle Stone, chair of the Marion County Commission, said preserving the collection was an important mission. Stone said that it was important for the community to keep the collection together.

Stone said the state will digitally archive the photos for anyone to view. The county and CF will have access to print copies.

“He was the first underwater photographer and his work was right here in Marion County,” Stone noted. “We didn’t want it sold off and split up all over the world.”

CF President Jim Henningsen said the Appleton Museum of Art, which is operated by CF, will one day soon showcase Mozert’s camera housings and 20 or so of his iconic photos that were hand colored and autographed by the legend. The exhibit has not been scheduled.

“We are fortunate the family decided to sell so that it (collection) could be preserved for our community,” Henningsen said.

Since the acquisition of the Mozert collection, Marion County government will be the first to display some of his work. The agency decided to display six of Mozert’s framed iconic photographs during Marion County’s 175th anniversary celebration, scheduled for 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at the McPherson Governmental Complex, 601 NE 25th Ave., Ocala.

Nick Zoller, a Marion County spokesman, said the six framed photographs will be on display at the Marion County tourism booth.

The subjects of Mozert’s framed pictures are:

• Lady sunning on the grassy banks of Silver Springs with a passing glass-bottom boat

• Aerial view of the swimming platform with glass-bottom boats in the background

• Lady underwater laying on the sand using a rotary phone

• Two ladies underwater holding a “Greetings from Silver Springs” sign

• Lady playing golf underwater from the “9th hole water trap”

• A diver using the underwater camera and housing to capture images.

Mozert spent 30 years as Silver Springs’ official photographer. He designed and built an underwater camera housing in the 1930s when “Tarzan” movies were being filmed at the park. He made a camera housing from Plexiglas, sheet metal and soldering wire. It was pieced together using a few nails and screws.

During an interview with the Star-Banner in 2013, two years before his death, Mozert shared the story of the day he first explored the concept of underwater photography.

“I saw that crystal clear water and that’s how I got into my underwater work,” Mozert said. “I went out in the backyard of Silver Springs one morning after I had made the camera case and I found an old inner tube. That was back when they were made out of real rubber. I fitted it on my arm and my arm fit tight. I attached it to the housing and took it down in the water. (“Tarzan” star) Johnny Weissmuller was there. They all laughed at me, but all 12 pictures came out clear. They ended up sending them to Hollywood.”

During Mozert’s career at Silver Springs, he shot photos of such notables as Gregory Peck, Lloyd Bridges and Jane Wyman.

“The photos I shot of Jayne Mansfield went worldwide,” Mozert said in 2013. “She was nobody until she came to Silver Springs, and boy did she play up the photography.”

And the legend of Bruce Mozert was born.

In 2016, a year after his death, the Appleton showcased more than 100 iconic images, many of which were Mozert’s.

The exhibit was called “Paradise Park Remembered: Photographs by Bruce Mozert and Others.” For 20 years until 1969, Mozert photographed visitors of Paradise Park, which was the African-American version of Silver Springs before integration.

1161,Website uses algorithms to match kids with foster families,"- In courtroom 3B at the West Pasco Judicial Center, 16-year-old Devon's life was about to change, along with his last name.

""Mastin, M-A-S-T-I-N,"" said Devon, with a smile.

With a judge's signature, Devon officially became the son of Jason and Jamie Mastin.

""I looked for a while and finally found them,"" said Devon.

He was paired with the couple back in 2018 on Family Match. The program uses similar algorithms as dating websites to find perfect matches for families to adopt foster children.

""Before Family Match, we would call about kids and people wouldn't even respond and call back,"" said Devon's adopted mother, Jamie.

But after signing up for Family Match, the Mastins found out about Devon in July 2018.

""His case worker called us and said, ‘We have a boy for you.’ And I said, ‘OK tell me about him.’ So they told us and I called him immediately and then we decided yes, let's do this,” Jamie recalled.

""I really wasn't really into looking for adoption until my case manager put me on there and I found these wonderful people,"" said Devon.

The family said it's been a perfect match for them and their adult daughters, now Devon's sisters.

""It just fills our heart because we always wanted a big family. We've had lots of foster kids but we wanted more of our own family,"" said Jamie.

""We've already seen 110 matches and this is our first adoption in the Tampa Bay area,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Wynter of the Selfless Love Foundation.

The foundation and Adoption Share brought Family Match to Florida.

""Our goal is to reduce the time to adoption placement and make better matches,"" continued Dr. Wynter.

Devon already has a special place in the family's heart.

""I added his birthstone to my mother's necklace,"" said Jamie.

And they have a special place in his.

""Family Match is an awesome website and I think anyone that should be looking to adopt or any kid that wants to be adopted should really use that website because it's helped me,” Devon added.

1162,"Two killed, four injured in SR 200 crash","Two children, ages 2 and 6, were hospitalized in serious condition Monday afternoon

OCALA — Two people were killed in a two-vehicle wreck at an Ocala intersection on Monday afternoon.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers identified the deceased as 81-year-old Franklin E. Kraus and Jane E. Tait, 70. Both were from Ocala, and they were in separate vehicles, troopers said.

Four other people, including two children, wereinjured in the crash. The children, ages 2 and 6 from Durham, North Carolina, were taken to UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville in serious condition. Authorities said the boy and girl, who are siblings, were restrained in their car seats.

The crash occurred at 12:21 p.m., troopers said.

According to FHP officials, a black 2012 Lexus RX 350 driven by William Tait, 70, of Ocala, was traveling on State Road 200 toward Citrus. Troopers said the Lexus had the green light to enter the intersection of SR 200 and County Road 484.

Kraus, driving a red 2016 GMC Terrain, was traveling eastbound on CR 484 when he entered the intersection.

Troopers said the Lexus was T-boned by the GMC vehicle, causing the Lexus to overturn at least once. The vehicle landed on its wheels at the intersection, officials said.

Kraus, who was wearing his seat belt, was transported to Ocala Regional Medical Center where he died. Marion County Fire Rescue officials had to extricate him from the vehicle.

Jane Tait, who was wearing her seat belt, died at the scene, troopers said.

MCFR officials had to cut the doors and roof from the Lexus to remove the occupants.

Tait’s husband was transported to ORMC in serious condition. He was wearing his seat belt, officials said.

FHP officials said Laura Campbell, 40, a relative of the Taits and mother of the two children, was taken to ORMC in serious condition. She's from Durham, North Carolina.

The investigation remains ongoing.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190325/two-killed-four-injured-in-sr-200-crash?rssfeed=true,2019-03-25T19:53:24Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471
1164,25 Women: Joanna Southerland-Mele inspires others to never give up,"CLOSE Meet the 25 Women You Need to Know in March Tallahassee Democrat

Joanna Southerland-Mele’s purpose in life was to keep her child alive.

At just 7 months old, Phil Southerland seemed to be dying, but doctors assured Southerland-Mele that everything was fine. They said that it’s normal for babies to lose a couple pounds of weight, that he just had the flu.

An instinct told her the doctors were wrong. Rushing her limp 8-month-old baby boy to the hospital, Southerland-Mele watched as the child was put on a glucose IV. He was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and immediately given insulin. Days later, he started gaining back the weight he had lost.

Southerland-Mele is one of the 25 Women You Need to Know. Now in its 13th year, the program is the Tallahassee Democrat’s way of honoring women who lead. Look for their profiles during March in print and see videos on tallahassee.com.

The moment Southerland-Mele was told about her son’s diagnosis, her entire life had to change.

“I found myself in the closet…shoving these potato chips in my mouth and sobbing because my kid had this incurable disease. I had my hand halfway up and I thought, he can’t ever eat like this,” the 69-year-old says.

Even at 8 months old, her child was already prone to heart attacks and strokes and would never be able to freely eat candy or deserts without it threatening his life.

“So, I stopped that day and started walking…I went to an exercise class and then I became an exercise instructor. Parallel to all this, I knew that I was the role model for my kid…and if I didn’t set that example because he was so young, who was going to do it for him?” she says.

Phil Southerland is now 37 years old and a professional cyclist. Southerland-Mele’s younger son, Jack, is 32 years old. Both boys grew up as competitive athletes.

Three decades later, the 69-year-old woman is still an outspoken advocate for people with Type 1 diabetes and has taught exercise classes in Tallahassee for nearly 34 years. She works part-time as an academic technologist at the Jim Moran School of Entrepreneurship at Florida State University.

Southerland-Mele routinely rides in 100-mile bike races, called centuries, to raise money and awareness for Type 1 research. Her energy comes from the 15 years she had to get up three times a night to test her son’s blood sugar levels.

“Exercise helped me beat the exhaustion, but I still needed to call on my friends sometimes to help me because I was too tired. We called ourselves the Mom Squad,” she says.

Southerland-Mele says she believes her friends nominated her for this series because, last year alone, she trained 8,000 miles on her bike, riding for the cause.

“I never gave up on keeping my kid alive and I’ve never given up on finding a cure. And I won’t until I fall off the bike and I have a crash…Or they find a cure,” she says.

Her advice to young people looking toward their future is to remember if they want to be good at something, “you have to practice.”

When Southerland-Mele’s child came home from the hospital with his diagnosis, she immediately had to learn how to give her infant shots of insulin while he was breastfeeding, and how to monitor his blood sugar levels.

“The other thing I would say is, if you think you’re right, trust yourself. Because if I hadn’t trusted myself to go up against these doctors…” Southerland-Mele trails off.

“Believe in yourself and make exercise like brushing your teeth.”

1165,Parkland community worried after 2 survivors’ suicides,"Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky said Monday that community leaders, government officials, parents, police and others held an emergency meeting Sunday after a second Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student apparently killed himself over the weekend.

FORT LAUDERDALE — Tragedies like the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High and Sandy Hook Elementary school massacres eventually fade from view, blunted by other mass shootings and the passage of time. But for the survivors, the pain can never end.

The father of a Sandy Hook victim killed himself Monday, just days after two Stoneman Douglas students also took their lives. The Florida deaths have officials in Parkland and nearby Coral Springs renewing their communities' focus on the suicide prevention and mental health resources that remain available 13 months after a gunman killed 17 people at the high school.

In Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 first-graders died along with six staff members six years ago, the body of 49-year-old Jeremy Richman was found outside his office Monday morning.

Richman's daughter Avielle was fatally shot at Sandy Hook. He had visited Florida last week and met with the parents of Stoneman Douglas victims, said Lori Alhadeff, whose 14-year-old daughter Alyssa died there.

Richman and his wife oversaw The Avielle Foundation, a group they started dedicated to preventing violence by better understanding brain health.

""Our hearts are shattered, and our heads are struggling to comprehend,"" the foundation said in a statement. ""Tragically, his death speaks to how insidious and formidable a challenge brain health can be and how critical it is for all of us to seek help for ourselves, our loved ones and anyone who we suspect may be in need.""

Multiple suicides among mass shooting survivors can be alarming, but mental health experts said the Florida deaths are not surprising. They come amid a rising nationwide trend: More than 47,000 U.S. suicides occurred in 2017, at the highest rate in at least half a century — 14 per 100,000. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among U.S. teenagers.

""One of the big risk factors for suicide is exposure to violence,"" said Dr. Louis Kraus, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.

Even if they weren't hit by bullets or didn't see shots fired, ""anyone who was at that school is at risk,"" Kraus said, and should be screened.

""The scars simply don't go away with a fresh coat of paint,"" he said.

Psychologist April Foreman, a board member at the American Association of Suicidology, said survivors are more prone to suicide and thus must be vigilant about mental health check-ups just as if they had a family history of breast cancer or heart disease.

With help, people can overcome their suicidal impulses, she said.

""It's not a foregone conclusion that this will happen to everyone who's been exposed to this and the majority of people who are suicidal don't go on to die. They go on to recover and live,"" she said.

The first suicide took place March 16. Cara Aiello told WFOR-TV last week that her 18-year-old daughter Sydney had suffered from survivor's guilt — her friend, Meadow Pollack, died in the attack.

Sydney had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and struggled to attend college because she feared being in a classroom, but never asked for help, her mother said.

Coral Springs police officer Tyler Reik confirmed Monday that a Stoneman Douglas sophomore apparently killed himself Saturday, but said an official determination had not been made pending an autopsy. The boy's name was not immediately released.

Community leaders, government officials, parents, police and others held an emergency meeting Sunday after the second student suicide, Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky said.

The biggest push will be to alert parents to talk to their children about whether they are having suicidal thoughts and outline the danger signs for them, such as personality changes or a preoccupation with death, she said.

The groups also want students to look out for each other, and noted that the community counseling and resource centers that opened after the attack still remain available.

The task has been made more difficult as Stoneman Douglas students are on spring break.

Hunschofsky said that while there is concern the two suicides could lead to more, it is more dangerous not to discuss what happened.

""We cannot be afraid of talking — the only way we are going to identify people who need help is to talk about it,"" she said.

A 16-year-old Stoneman Douglas sophomore who was in a classroom where three students died on Feb. 14, 2018, told The Associated Press on Monday that she tried to kill herself four times before she entered therapy.

At first, she was ashamed, she said, fearing that accepting counseling would mean she ""couldn't' handle my problems"" and ""I was broken."" But her attitude changed with the support of therapists, family and friends, said the girl, who the AP is not naming because of her age.

The girl said she fears not every Stoneman Douglas student who needs counseling is getting it and noted that some teachers seem uncomfortable talking about suicide and simply want to move on.

In Connecticut, Richman was among the Sandy Hook relatives suing Infowars host Alex Jones for contending the Newtown shooting never happened.

Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse Lewis, was killed at Sandy Hook, said the families' grief has been compounded by such conspiracy theories.

""Every day you get up, you expect to get punched in the chin,"" Heslin said. ""I give Jeremy credit for what he accomplished with his work and his amazing strength that grew through the years.""

Newtown Police Lt. Aaron Bahamonde said Richman left a suicide note, but did not disclose its contents.

On Monday, residents streamed into the Resiliency Center of Newtown, which was set up shortly after the shooting as a place for therapy and for people to gather to talk. Richman worked with the center in providing ""brain health"" first aid for children and others.

His friend, Stephanie Cinque, the center's executive director, said people are angry, sad and shocked by his death.

""There's mixed feelings throughout town,"" she said. ""Grief is complicated. It's very sad for the family, the children, the entire community. So today we're letting people know it's OK to have those feelings.""

The emotional scars survivors feel last for decades.

Columbine High massacre survivor Heather Martin was not physically injured in the 1999 shooting that left 13 dead, but said she took years to emotionally overcome the attack. She helped form the Rebels Project, named after Columbine's mascot, to assist mass trauma survivors.

""Resilience is connecting with other people and gaining strength from other people,"" Martin said. ""You don't always have to be the strongest person.""",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190325/parkland-community-worried-after-2-survivors-suicides?rssfeed=true,2019-03-25T15:27:04Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401

Sometime just after 7:30 Sunday night, while Duke players were busy kissing the feet of basketball gods, Orlando-area emergency rooms were apparently getting very busy. Reports came fast and furious that vanloads of UCF hoop fans were arriving in haste, many desperate to have their hearts un-wrenched, some insisting theirs only minutes earlier had actually stopped beating. Word has it one hospital treated dozens whose eyes had gone Sahara desert when their tear ducts flat out ran dry.Many of you went to bed and couldn’t sleep, replaying the unsettling vision of a basketball circling a cylinder over and over and over again, and never dad-gummit falling through the hoop.77-76.Sunday’s one-point setback to the top-seeded Blue Devils in the NCAA’s second round abruptly brought to an end UCF’s otherwise amazing season, yet reminded all of us that while losing is almost always painful, it also can reveal character, and in this case, escort a blossoming program onto a national stage.Athletic Director Danny White insisted in the tumult of this March Sadness moment that this defeat would prove a positive for the basketball program. Think about it. Virtually no one in the aftermath of the Duke game, not ESPN or CBS or TBS or your butcher or the mailman or cousin Hank is talking about how UCF lost. They’re talking about how the Knights could have and probably should have beaten the presumed best damn team in the country. The final buzzer Sunday also brought to an end the college career of the most important player in UCF basketball history.With a nod and apology to Bo Clark, who in the late ‘70s led the Knights to great things in Division II and had his jersey retired while playing for dad Torchy, B.J. Taylor is and deserves to be the UCF basketball poster boy. Not even close.As a senior guard at Boone High, Taylor was the pinball wizard of hoops. Any given night, any given gym, pass this guy the ball and wait for flashing lights and ringing bells. The scoreboards became spinning tallies as Taylor went for about 35 points a game. Classmates didn’t have to see B.J. to know he was at school. They just listened for the sizzle. He was Florida’s 8A Player of the Year. Got overtures from Florida, Michigan State and Indiana, among many others. So what did he do? He stayed home. Crazy kid went to UCF.Could have been an Izzo Whizzo or Hoosier Hunk, but B.J. Taylor chose UCF because – brace yourself for this - he wanted to help make his hometown university’s basketball program a winner. Cared so much about Orlando that he shunned other, perhaps better, certainly more high-profile opportunities. Someone ring up the Hallmark people, because B.J. went out and, by golly, got the job done. Didn’t come without a setback or two. Lower leg injury kept him on the bench his sophomore season. Later broke a bone in his foot. But neither ever became his Achilles heel. Of course, as we were reminded Sunday, he hardly did it alone. Aubrey Dawkins, the son of coach Johnny, transferred from Michigan and was terrific this year. His 32 points and dogged determination against Duke was inspiring. And of course, Tacko Fall, the 7-6 gentle giant who annoyed Zion Williamson and the Blue Devils all night. He’s no taller now thanthanhe was four years ago, but man, has he grown. As his UCF playing days end, Tacko’s only real concerns now are MINI Coopers and ceiling fans.Indeed, the metamorphosis of the UCF program has been nothing short of remarkable. An N-I-T semi-finalist two seasons ago, an indication then that The Little Engine That Could, can. Then Friday night, the Knights breaking through for their first-ever NCAA tourney win, an evening when The Little Engine That Could, did. And in defeat Sunday, learning that the Little Engine isn’t so little, after all.None of this would have happened without Taylor. As fiery and competitive on court as he is pleasant and polite away from it, B.J. was the unselfish leader who loved sharing the wealth and spotlight, yet remained a cold-blooded go-to when any game was hanging in the balance. UCF fans stormed the court following an electric, late-season victory against ranked Cincinnati, a last-second dagger from you-know-who the difference. It was Taylor’s final home game as a Knight, but there were no tears. B.J. says he’s not much for crying.The anguish on his face as he left the floor in Columbia Sunday was born not only of the crushing loss, but also the finality of the moment, the realization that his remarkable college career was over. But again, no tears.Doesn’t mean he isn’t sentimental. Doesn’t mean he won’t take some time in the coming days or weeks or even years to look back fondly at what he accomplished at UCF and appreciate the difference he made, not only as a player or leader or student, but also as a gutty trendsetter who changed the course of a basketball program. A young man who proved that you really can go places, if you just stay home.",https://www.wesh.com/article/ucf-heartbreak-and-a-tribute-to-bj-taylor/26928180,2019-03-25T12:09:00Z,WESH-TV,Couple,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789
1174,Florida High director addresses parents after viral video containing 'hate speech',"A video circulating social media shows students from Florida State University Schools high school students using a racial slur. (Photo: alexsl / Getty Images)

A director is condemning ""hate speech and behavior"" after a video circulating on social media purported to show a student from Florida High using a racial slur while firing a BB gun at another student.

In the video, three white boys, who appear to be teenagers, stand in front of a Confederate flag. One boy loads the BB gun and points it at another boy whose buttocks is exposed. Someone says, ""kill that (redacted racist expletive)"" and the boy with the BB gun shoots it at the exposed buttocks.

The video appears to have originally been posted to Snapchat. It was reposted on Instagram and Facebook.

Dennis Schnittker, a spokesman with FSU, said he could not confirm whether the students in the video attend FSU, but pointed to an email sent to parents Monday.

""Florida State University Schools administrators are aware of a widely circulated video containing racist and offensive language and images,"" Director Stacy Chambers said in the statement sent to parents. ""FSUS condemns hate speech and behavior as we strive to create a community of respect and inclusivity.""

FSUS did not respond to requests for further comment.

One parent said students were told by administrators they could stay home from school if they felt uncomfortable. But the parent said administrators told students they would be suspended if they shared the video or posted about it on social media.

The parent's daughter also told her the students in the video and their friends were bullying students who reported the video. The parent and student's name are being withheld because the parent feared her daughter would be harassed at school.

The school's statement said when FSUS receives reports of misconduct, it reviews them for violations of the code of conduct and takes action from that point. but it said because of privacy laws, it couldn't comment whether the students in the video were being disciplined.

The student code of conduct includes a section about the unacceptable use of technology on and off campus. It says students who use technology in a way that ""has the effect of interfering with a student’s educational performance, opportunities, or benefits"" or ""has the effect of disrupting the orderly operation of a school"" may be subject to administrative consequences.

1184,Escaped dogs terrorize Gainesville neighborhood,"Residents captured two of the dogs, one of which was killed by a Gainesville Police officer. The other was likely suffocated by the residents trying to hold it down.

Two dogs that marauded through a northwest Gainesville neighborhood, in which a pet dog was killed in a September mauling, were killed Friday night and a dog they attacked was injured in the latest of a series of canine attacks.

Five dogs described as pit bulls owned by Reynaldo Davila, 5901 NW 30th Terrace, got through a damaged fence and began terrorizing the Northwood Pines neighborhood.

Residents captured two of the dogs, one of which was killed by a Gainesville Police officer. The other was likely suffocated by the residents trying to hold it down, said GPD Inspector Jorge Campos.

Northwood Pines is the neighborhood in which Bella, a small mixed breed owned by Linda Swinburn, was killed in September by pit bulls that had escaped from the home of owner Nathaniel Pettiford, a street over from Friday night’s attack.

Resident Virginia Brissette and Campos described a street under siege at about 8:30 p.m. when the dogs escaped.

“Five dogs came from Rey Davila’s yard...They are running amok in the neighborhood. They were running at a couple that had a dog in their yard. A dog chased the woman into the house, menaced her and attacked their dog,” Brissette said. “The husband was able to pry the pit bull off their dog and slam him against the wall, and the dog just kept going.”

That couple was Dustin and Amber Banks with their dog Lucy. Once Banks made sure his dog and wife were OK, he grabbed his baseball bat and ran down the street to the home of Wayne and Ingrid Carney, where dogs were attacking their beagle-mix, Penny.

They eventually got the dogs off Penny, who was taken to the emergency clinic at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine. Carney said she has wide, deep wounds and added that the concern is the wounds will get infected.

Meanwhile, two other dogs were attacking a third canine farther down the street. Campos said an officer was directed to that house and found several residents holding down dogs.

“One of the guys holding it was pleading for help, saying he was fatigued and couldn’t hold it anymore. The officer instructs him to release the dog. The dog was still aggressive so the officer shoots the dog and dispatches it,” Campos said. “The owner shows up at this point and says he can control the other dog. When they let go, the dog had died, probably from suffocation from them holding him down.”

The officer who shot the dog was Cpl. Dylan Hayes-Morrison, a member of GPD’s K-9 unit, Campos said.

Five dogs were confiscated by Alachua County Animal Services, including the bodies of the two dead dogs. Campos said no charges were filed against Davila.

Davila said he feels badly about the incident and apologized to the Carneys.

“It wasn’t meant to happen. I’m glad everybody is OK and the dog is alive. I lost two of my dogs,” Davila said. “I didn’t want anybody to get hurt. At least for that I am thankful.”

Animal Services Director Ed Williams said the three dogs that were impounded will likely be processed under the county’s dangerous dog ordinance. If that happens, Davila would have to have the dogs neutered, get insurance on the dogs, ensure they are confined and meet other standards. If he doesn’t, the dogs will be euthanized.

Carney said the pit bulls escaped through a rotted portion of Davila’s wood fence and into his yard through an opening in his chain link fence that had earlier been pried open by the dogs.

They ran down the street and were spotted by Amber Banks.

“I heard them coming down the street. I heard a loud ruckus going on. I was like, ‘Baby, there’s three pit bulls coming this way. (One dog) kind of locks eyes on me and starts running at me,” Amber said.

Continued Dustin, “I went inside to get my baseball bat. By the time I came back, Amber was screaming. I open the door and see three pit bulls and Amber on the ground. Two run off and I open the door and tell Amber to get in. Lucy was there and it locked eyes on her and, whoom, right through the door.”

Dustin Banks said the pit bull latched onto Lucy’s neck. He pried its jaws open once but it locked on Lucy again. He pried them again and flung it against the wall.

“I was like, OK, it’s now or never — this thing is going to kill my dog. With God’s strength I was able to pry those jaws off. I slammed it and opened the door and threw it out,” Dustin Banks said. “It’s only by the grace of God and my faith that I was able to do it.”

Banks grabbed his bat and ran down the street after hearing neighbors screaming.

Carney said he saw Banks walking down the street with a bat and opened the door to see what was happening.

“That’s when I saw two of the dogs in my front yard. In a brief seven-second exchange (with Banks) Penny snuck out the door, saw a third dog and ran up to it to chase her to play,” Carney said. “Unfortunately, they did chase her and then all three of them were latched onto her. I started punching and grabbing the dogs so they would let go. Nothing was working. (Banks) was hitting them with the bat. We were able to get one off and then work on the other two. Then the other one was on her.”

Eventually, Carney was able to lift Penny up when the three pit bulls let her loose for a second.

Carney and Amber and Wayne Banks said they have nothing against pit bulls but said owners need to ensure that their dogs do not get loose.

Brissette said Davila’s dogs have escaped before and have been reported to Animal Services and police.

“Neighbors on every side of (Davila) have contacted GPD and or Alachua County Animal Services to ask for help,” Brissette said. “It’s a big deal. This is not the first time these dogs have gotten out.”

Several dog attacks have occurred recently.

On March 8, Kinnamon Tanner, 2, was fatally mauled at the home of his auntin High Springs by two dogs that were in the yard.

Lorraine Anderson was injured and her dog Tico killed on Feb. 26 while they were walking in Palmetto Villas. Anderson was injured trying to save Tico. The culprits were two neighboring dogs that had gotten through a hole in the fence.

In December a puggle named Fred was killed as he being walked in an Alachua neighborhood by Arlene Stewart, who was injured, by two dogs that got out of a house unexpected.

Also in December, a Gainesville boy was injured while riding his bike by a dog that got out of the house. It also killed a cat.

The attack on Bella and Swinburn in September began the series.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190325/escaped-dogs-terrorize-gainesville-neighborhood?rssfeed=true,2019-03-25T08:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
1190,Dealing with Employee Cynicism: How a Culture of Trust Can Help | Quint Studer,"Cynicism is bad for business. It’s not only ugly, but it’s also a symptom of deeper, more destructive issues. When people are routinely snarky, skeptical, and negative—whether their attitude is aimed at leaders, coworkers, customers, or the company itself—by definition they can’t be engaged and positive. And if they’re not engaged and positive, they can’t be productive, innovative, and helpful to team members and customers.

Cynical behavior harms workplace relationships. It undermines change efforts. It drains enthusiasm. Cynical employees may be irritable or grumpy. No one wants to work with them. They surely won’t put forth extra effort when it’s needed. Plus, cynicism is contagious. A few cynical employees can spread their negative attitude, and before you know it, everyone is infected.

Usually, cynicism is a sign that people are feeling hopeless and powerless. They may feel unsafe, devalued, not listened to. They may see leaders as being ineffective or as not truly having their best interests at heart. And they have no faith that the organization will ever change things for the better. (In all fairness, they may never have seen any evidence of positive change.)

More: Know what causes workplace drama — and take steps to eradicate it | Quint Studer

Your best defense for dealing with cynicism is a good offense. You must attack the problem at the source. You need to proactively and urgently get to work building a culture of trust. This will not happen overnight. But it will improve relationships and promote credibility and resilience.

Get intentional about creating a culture of trust. It won’t happen on its own. Make it a priority. Work to pinpoint what processes or leader behaviors need to change. This will require some digging into the specific issues that may be eroding trust inside your company. Then, create a plan and assign someone to oversee the changes.

Also, it may help to acknowledge publicly that there’s a big problem and that you want to correct it. “We know that in the past things have happened that created the current environment of mistrust. We are committed to fixing this.”

Let people know what right looks like. What are the values and behaviors that define a culture of trust? Do some thinking about this and spell out the behaviors. For example:

- Employees are empowered to make decisions. They don’t have to get permission for everything.

- Employees have a voice and a seat at the table. Leaders seek feedback from them and implement their ideas whenever possible.

- People get to work on challenging projects. Leaders don’t micromanage them.

- Leaders regularly recognize and reward employee contributions.

- Employees are able to choose their work patterns and habits. If they want to work from home or work a flexible schedule, they can (as long as it’s feasible for the job).

- Communication is a top priority. Leaders touch base daily with direct reports to answer questions, offer help, and reduce uncertainty (and the anxiety it causes).

Put it in writing. Creating an official “standards of behavior” document helps crystallize the attitude you’re hoping to cultivate. Spell out actions that create trust and prohibit cynical behavior and put it all in a document. For example: “I will not badmouth customers,” “If I have something to say to an employee, I’ll say it to their face,” “I will step in and help coworkers anytime I can,” “I will not use blind cc’ing in the emails I send.” Have everyone (leaders and employees) sign it and hold them accountable for infractions.

More: Six great ice breakers for high-performance groups | Quint Studer

Let only “Boy Scouts” lead. (And Girl Scouts too, of course!) Hire and promote leaders who truly do live the values your company espouses. They will do too much damage otherwise, which paves the way for mistrust and cynicism. People will emulate leader behavior, so make sure leaders build on and nurture the trust you are trying to create.

Be clear and predictable. Let people know what they can expect. Vagueness and a lack of predictability in behavior, priorities, or values only create anxiety and destroys trust. How can employees trust a leader if they don’t know what that leader wants from them or how that leader might react day to day?

Keep your promises. Do what you say you will do (with both customers and employees). This has to be an across-the-board value. If you aren’t sure you can keep a promise, don’t make it in the first place. And if something outside your control happens and you have to break a promise, let people know as soon as you possibly can. Explain why and apologize.

Be transparent and tell the truth at all times, even when it’s bad news. If there’s even a hint that you could be lying, covering up, or being evasive, employee cynicism will be validated. Trust will be shattered. Once that happens, it is incredibly hard to win people back.

Promote psychological safety. Make it safe to speak up. Are employees allowed to make mistakes without being scolded, shamed, or otherwise punished? If not, they are very unlikely to tell leaders the truth. If they share an idea in a meeting, are they taken seriously? If not, they will keep quiet. Fear and trust cannot coexist. Always choose trust.

It won’t happen overnight, but when people realize that they can trust their leaders, and each other, cynicism will taper off. It simply can’t get a foothold in a culture of trust.

Working in a culture of trust just feels better. People will be more positive and engaged, and the mood of the organization will shift. From that point, amazing things may happen. Everyone will enjoy coming to work. They’ll feel a strong sense of meaning and purpose.

1191,"Lawmen say Marianna 14-year-old shot, killed his grandmother","MARIANNA — Authorities say a Florida teen fatally shot his grandmother.

The Tallahassee Democrat reports that the 14-year-old boy was arrested Monday and charged with murder.

The Jackson County Sheriff’s Office said the teen reported the killing earlier this month. He told dispatchers that someone had broken into his Marianna home and killed his grandmother, 65-year-old Patricia Shack.

A shotgun and two .22-caliber rifles were found at the home. A state crime lab found that a bullet recovered from the victim matched one of the rifles.

Investigators say discrepancies in the teen’s story, the bullet and witness statements led to the arrest.

1192,Touching photo shows cable tech who ‘walked into a mess’ soothing crying child,"GREENVILLE, S.C. – A cable worker’s act of kindness has gone viral.

Jessica Nash Donnahoo, of South Carolina, posted a photo on Facebook of Spectrum employee Rob Kinney holding and comforting her 3-year-old son, Sailor, who she says was born with rare brain defects and is blind.

Here is her entire Facebook post:

Dear Spectrum Internet, Today your technician Robert came to our home to upgrade our internet and help us start up TV streaming. He walked into a mess. My son, Sailor, is three years old. He was born with two rare brain defects and he is blind. He is unable to communicate his needs, and today has been rough for him. He has been crying all morning. I’ve been trying to soothe him while also meeting the needs of my two year old daughter, cleaning, washing dishes, and doing laundry while my husband works. It’s just been a tough day. When Robert walked in and started talking, Sailor ran to him and reached up. Robert didn’t seem bothered at all and, instead, held my son off and on for the whole 45 minutes he was in our home. He snuggled him close while I folded laundry. It was a huge relief to this tired momma. Robert could have walked in, rushed, and left but instead he saw a need greater than internet and met it. That’s beyond customer service- it’s humanity at its best. Robert deserves a raise… a promotion… something! He’s an asset to your company and I will never forget his kindness.

Sincerely,

Jessica

According to Good Morning America, Kinney has worked for Spectrum for nine years, and is a single dad to a 4-year-old. Donnahoo said she thinks that’s one of the reasons he was so wonderful with her little boy.

“I said, ‘You want me to pick you up, buddy?’ while looking at her just to get a feel or not if it would be a problem,” Kinney told GMA. “She seemed okay with it so I picked him up and held him while I was doing a few things inside. He was super comfortable with it to the point he started getting sleepy.”

So many people loved Kinney’s act of kindness that Donnahoo’s March 16 post has been shared more than 132K times, as of Thursday afternoon.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/03/22/touching-photo-shows-cable-tech-who-walked-into-a-mess-soothing-crying-child/,2019-03-22T12:34:32Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394
1193,Habitat for Humanity Food Truck Festival raises awareness with good taste,"Much like the Habitat for Humanity growth and recognition has exploded in the community, so has the signature event that helps raise funds for the cause.

The fourth annual Habitat for Humanity Food Truck Festival on April 5-6 at the Community Maritime Park promises as many as 40 different food trucks — enough to feed the projected crowd of 20,000-30,000 people.

That's a far cry from the seven trucks the festival had in its inaugural year.

""We live in such a perfect place with the breeze coming off the water and all the smells of all the food trucks. With the good music and all that, it's just going to be a really good couple of days,” said Crystal Scott, director of resource development for Habitat for Humanity of Pensacola.

The festival has always been about creating a signature event that “was good and fun for the community to participate in, but also raises awareness about what we do.""

There will be activities for children in the park that looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss movie, which will be central to all the hubbub. With free admission, it’s a great way to picnic — urban style.

And what better accompaniment is there to food than music?

""We chose performers who were kind of middle of the road — nothing too crazy on either end of the spectrum, but it's kinda got a folky vibe to it,"" Scott said. ""We've got local acts that are performing on Friday evening; the regional actions are going to perform on Saturday.”

Spreading the good word isn’t hard in this age of digital information technology.

""The people that we have had come have really enjoyed it, marked their calendars, and told their friends,"" Scott said. ""They were just thrilled when we posted it on Facebook. All three years, hundreds and hundreds of people were tagging their friends.”

The festival is not a traditional way for people to learn about the great work Habitat does, but it is a “foodies paradise,” Scott said.

The Habitat program is in the business of “making home ownership achievable for individuals and families who may or may not have had the opportunity otherwise. Habitat for Humanity provides affordable mortgages for people who are ready to become a homeowner.""

Habitat has been around since 1981 and services almost 1,000 mortgages in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties. The way they’re able to do this is because of those existing mortgages, which are like a rolling fund.

Those who own a Habitat home are, in a sense, paying it forward by paying their mortgages.

Habitat home owners actually do more to get into their homes, for they also have to donate a certain amount of “sweat equity,” which means they volunteer a certain number of hours of construction on their home or someone else’s home, all a part of that “instilling in our homeowners the importance of giving back,” Scott said.

Buyers can choose different land options and locations for their Habitat home, based on affordability, and even options within their home, right down to the countertops. “We think that's so important for people to be vested and feel like they're choosing all these things,"" Scott said.

There is no distinguishing a Habitat home from another developer’s.

One of the goals of Habitat is to build wealth for the families of Habitat home owners and to “change the trajectory of an entire generation based on all of these people coming together and working together.

“The bringing people together part is the thing that got me — that no matter who you are or what you do, there is a way to connect with Pensacola Habitat and the mission,"" Scott said. ""We bring people together to build homes, communities, and hope. You've got people from all walks of life on the same build site.”

That same camaraderie is a big part of the success of the Food Truck Festival.

“Aside from the awesome food, the beautiful venue, being able to come and enjoy a Friday night or Saturday with your family ... aside from all those awesome things, (it’s) being able to come and be with community and know that your presence in being there is something that's for a really great cause.”

ALBANY, N.Y. - April the Giraffe has once again given birth in front of an enthralled YouTube audience.

The Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York, said April gave birth to a healthy male calf around 12:45 p.m. Saturday. They say more than 300,000 watched live.

Park officials say the newborn giraffe was on its feet by 1:27 p.m., and nursing by 1:51 p.m.

April drew more than 232 million YouTube live views during a seven-week period in 2017 before she gave birth to Tajiri (tah-JEER'-ee). That came as a surprise for the small zoo 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of New York City.

This is April's fifth calf and the second for her and Oliver.

Michele Hall looks down at the pregnancy test cradled in her hand.

A plus sign appears. She gasps.How can this be?

From the bathroom, she yells for her husband, Jerry, who's in the kitchen making breakfast. They meet at the doorway and she slowly hands him their future.

A plus sign. Positive.

She watches him as he stares down at the tiny symbol that holds so much value. The blood drains from his face.

They look at one another. How can they raise another child? How is it even possible?

She's 50. He's 47.

She's already a mom of four. All her children are grown and out of the house, except for her 14-year-old daughter, Aubrey Hall, the only child she shares with Jerry.

More: As births decline in young women, they keep rising in 40-somethings. Here's why.

In 2017, her doctor told her she was in menopause. Based on a blood test result, her chances of becoming pregnant were slim to none.

Oct. 8, 2018, was the day Michele Hall found out she was pregnant. She was already at about 26 weeks. It's a boy.

How did she miss the signs? She didn't experience any morning sickness or weight gain. She felt bodily aches and pains but brushed them off as signs of menopause or lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease she'd been battling for more than 10 years. That was until she realized it could be something else, so she bought the pregnancy test.

In the span of two months — from October to December — the Halls experienced every emotion in the book when they learned they were having a baby boy.

Shock

Shock was the first reaction.

""Everyone was in shock,"" Michele Hall said about her family's reaction to the surprising news. At this time, she was only weeks away from giving birth.

“Definitely in shock,” her husband agreed.

""So in shock,"" daughter Aubrey said.

“It does make me feel young, though,"" her father quipped.

“Not me,"" said Michele Hall, laughing. ""I don’t feel so young right now.""

The Halls, who live in Golden Gate Estates, had less than two months to prepare for their baby.

While it was a blessing, Michele and Jerry Hall didn't have any plans to expand their family. Once their daughter left the nest, they planned to travel more, maybe go on a cruise.

“But we have to put the brakes on that and start over again,” Michele Hall said.

They never questioned whether or not they would keep the baby. It was a no-brainer. Yes, of course, they would.

In a way, motherhood has defined Michele Hall.

She had her first child, Aaron Myers, now 34, at age 15. Then she gave birth to a girl, Heather Yeager, now 28, and another son, Brandon Myers, 24. Her youngest is Aubrey. Her eldest daughter has two children — 6-year-old Maeleigh and Emmalyn, 4, who live in Iowa. Her two sons live in Pennsylvania, where the Halls are originally from.

“Everyone was in shock” Michele Hall,, 50-year-old mom and grandma

Michele Hall, along with husband Jerry and daughter Aubrey, moved to Golden Gate Estates several years ago after falling in love with the area.

Michele started home schooling Aubrey. Jerry worked as a cabinetmaker. They lived in a cozy house with plenty of land. Life was good.

Her doctor in Pennsylvania told her she was in menopause. The diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor in Naples. Any chance of her becoming pregnant, they said, was close to zero.

Before a woman reaches menopause, she undergoes a yearslong transition called perimenopause, or the transition to menopause. This process usually starts in the mid-to-late 40s. During this process, a woman may deal with irregular periods and hot flashes, according to the Office on Women's Health, a division of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

The average age for menopause in the United States is 52. Menopause is reached once it has been a full year since the last period. At that stage, a woman can no longer get pregnant.

Michele Hall said she didn't have a period for more than a year. For a chunk of that time, as she didn't realize until later on, it was because she was already pregnant.

When she found out she was expecting, she said she felt like one of those women on the defunct TLC documentary series ""I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant.""

How could you not know you're pregnant? She thought.

“I used to call bull on that until it happened to me.""

Fear

After getting past the initial shock, Michele Hall became fearful.

The odds were stacked against her. She had lupus, pre-existing high blood pressure and late prenatal care. Throw her age into the mix.

Was her baby going to be all right?

She saw doctors regularly in the two months leading up to the delivery at NCH North Naples Hospital on Dec. 27. Since her pregnancy was considered high-risk, she underwent a scheduled cesarean delivery, or C-section, in lieu of a natural birth.

Before delivery, doctors believed her baby was roughly 37 weeks old, but that number was just a guesstimate, given that Michele Hall wasn't sure when she conceived him. Following his birth, she was told he was about 34 to 35 weeks old. A full-term pregnancy lasts between 39 and 40 weeks, according to March of Dimes.

Naples obstetrician Dr. Thomas “Tom” Beckett first met Michele Hall at his office on Dec. 20, only a week before delivering her son. He runs his own practice and is also a provider with the Healthcare Network of Southwest Florida.

Hall beat his previous record of age 48 for the oldest patient he'd ever delivered a baby for in his 30-year career. ""Fifty was a whole new decade for me.""

Beckett said there are cases where women, in their 30s or 40s, become pregnant after being told their chances were slim.

In Hall's case, he added, ""She just released that one egg that did it.""

Although she wasn't expecting to have a baby at this stage in life, Hall said she knows how lucky she is. Many women around her age pay top-dollar to have a child via in vitro fertilization. She did it the old-fashioned way.

The most common cause of age-related decline in fertility is less-frequent ovulation. As women age, they begin to have occasional cycles where an egg is never released. Miscarriage is also more common in women over the age of 35, according to the American Pregnancy Association.

Hall felt alone. Were other women her age having unexpected pregnancies?

She took to social media and posted her story on a private Facebook Naples mom group, weeks before giving birth. Several moms liked and commented on her post, writing words of encouragement and support. A few, in their 40s, messaged her with similar stories, but no one her age.

In the weeks before giving birth, Hall took extreme care of herself, going to doctor appointments regularly and resting as much as she could.

When she'd go out in public, she said she started feeling a little self-conscious. Sometimes people would stare at her belly.

“A lot of older people would look at me and do a double take because they were probably trying to figure out if I was as old as they thought I was,” she said.

But she had a strong support system.

But, on Dec. 27, 2018, baby Grayson Matthew Hall was born at NCH North Naples Hospital. (Photo: Srijita Chattopadhyay/Naples Daily News)

Excitement

Flowery wrapped boxes and bags of baby toys and gear piled up in the corner of a multipurpose room at Vineyards Community Park in Naples. It was Dec. 15. Hall was expecting any day now and, to celebrate, friends threw her a baby shower.

After the initial shock and fear, she was excited.

""This baby signals a new beginning,” she said.

The Halls left most of their family and friends behind in Pennsylvania, so for a while it was just the three of them. Now they were expecting a new member of the family and had a supportive community around them.

At the shower, neighbors, fellow home-school teachers and ice skating friends of Aubrey's celebrated with food, gifts and hugs. Hall's children, except Aubrey, couldn't make it to the shower, but she communicated regularly with them throughout the pregnancy

""She's a trouper,"" neighbor and friend Robin Currence said of Michele.

A friend, Lynda Rowley, learned the mom-to-be was pregnant in the car on the way to an ultrasound appointment. Hall had asked Rowley to take her somewhere that day but didn't break the news until they were already on their way.

""I was so surprised,"" Rowley said.

During the shower, Hall was all smiles. Her growing belly was visible underneath a loose dress. She was feeling pretty good, except for the swelling in her feet and ankles and on-and-off heart palpitations.

The Halls grew emotional as they opened their gifts, revealing bath sets, a diaper bag, clothes, booties and a baby bouncer.

""I'm ready to meet him,"" Michele Hall said.

They named their son Grayson. They originally chose the name Grace if it was a girl, but when they found out it was a boy, they altered it slightly.

""He'll be here by the grace of God,” she said.

Anxious

On Dec. 27, Michele Hall gave birth to her healthy baby boy at NCH North Naples Hospital off Immokalee Road.

Based on medical records for the past 10 years, it appears 53 is the age of the oldest woman who has given birth across all NCH Healthcare system locations, according to NCH spokesman Shawn McConnell. It wasn't known whether that baby was conceived naturally.

Due to it being a high-risk pregnancy, Beckett had ordered a C-section. Michele Hall never had surgery before. The idea frightened her, but she had no choice.

The longer she carried the baby, the doctor said, the higher the risk of her suffering from cardiac issues or seizures.

Grayson weighed a little more than 6 pounds and measured 19 inches long.

Following his birth, Grayson suffered one sleep apnea episode and several episodes where he had a slower heart rate, or bradycardia. He was kept under surveillance at the hospital's newborn intensive care unit for 12 days.

He also suffered from transient tekipnia of the newborn, a term for a temporary mild respiratory problem of babies that begins after birth.

Those 12 days were tough on the Halls.

“It goes through your mind that something can go wrong,"" Michele Hall said, tearing up. She looked down at Grayson finally in her arms at the NICU more than a week after the C-section, on Jan. 5. He was released two days later.

She couldn't see her son for days following the delivery. When she finally could, she never strayed too far. When she was discharged from the hospital on New Year's Eve, her and her husband stayed at the NICU to celebrate with their newborn.

Most nights the couple stayed in an overflow room, a short walk from Grayson's curtained-off room. When they went home for a short break, they still kept an eye on him through the NICU camera system.

Hopeful

Grayson sleeps deeply, nestled in the arms of his mother on a Sunday afternoon in early February at their Golden Gate Estates home. At nearly 2 months old, he finally outgrew his premature clothes and weighed about 8 pounds.

He's a quiet baby, crying occasionally only. His favorite hobbies are eating and sleeping.

""He sleeps like a log,"" Michele Hall said.

After cradling the sleeping baby for more than an hour, she passed him to Aubrey, who gladly took the role of the older sister. She sat on the sofa and expertly fed him milk as Food Network's ""Guy's Grocery Games"" played on the living room TV. Aubrey had rehearsed the role when her nieces were infants.

The only sound was the TV — until Aubrey yelled: ""Not it!"" She wrinkled her nose as a strong smell emanated from Grayson's diaper.

""Not it,"" repeated her father, who was in another room.

It was Michele's turn for diaper duty.

The Halls have adjusted to their new normal, and so have their yellow Lab Milly, cat Luna and pet turtles.

""Now we're just settling back into our regular lives after a chaotic 12 to 13 weeks,"" Michele Hall said.

Before Grayson arrived home, on Jan. 7, the Halls were able to transform their guest bedroom into a woodlands-themed nursery. Stuffed foxes and bears adorned the room. A drawing his sister did with his name on it and images of furry critters hung on the wall over the crib.

The first night at home was the toughest, said Michele Hall, who didn't get much sleep. She was too worried, given everything that had happened at the NICU.

If anything were to happen, the Halls learned CPR from a first responder neighbor. Luckily, they haven't had to use it.

Michele Hall, who turns 51 in May, won't be having any more children. She made sure of that. During the C-section, Beckett removed her fallopian tubes.

""I'm 100 percent sure I'm not having any more kids,"" she said, even though she's so grateful for her miracle baby. ""He's a blessing.""

1202,Rays of light emerge from tragic life stories in Honduras,"Ledger reporter Gary White recently accompanied local Rotary Club members on a one-week trip to Honduras. This is the second of a three-part series examining a group home founded by a Babson Park couple that is providing hope for young girls rescued from a life of abuse, sex trafficking and abandonment in the Central America country.

CHOLOMA, Honduras — Visiting a home filled with girls saved from sex trafficking, abuse and abandonment, it's natural to expect sadness or misery.

Instead, the 22 girls and one toddler boy in the Compelled By Christ group home generate a buoyant mood. Aside from an occasional pout, the youngsters exude gratitude and seize on any chance to have fun, whether by jumping rope or playing card games or singing together.

The placid mood at the home founded by Bonnie and Keith Barker of Babson Park belies the painful personal histories of its residents. Honduras is one of the poorest and most dangerous countries in the Americas, and some families do what would seem unimaginable in the United States, selling their daughters to sex traffickers, often for scant sums.

The girls confide in Bonnie, commonly addressed as ""Mommy Bonnie,"" who spends one week a month at the home. Sindy, one of two mothers at the facility, told Barker that her mother sold her at age 6 to a gang for a mere dos pollos — two chickens. The girl arrived at the Choloma shelter at age 11, five months pregnant.

Her daughter, Ana, an irrepressible 4-year-old, is the youngest girl living at the home.

Now 16, Sindy is perhaps the most industrious of the residents and seems always to be cleaning or helping to prepare meals. A frequent volunteer in the kitchen, she aspires to be a chef.

The other resident mother, Scarlett, endured being forced into prostitution before adolescence by relatives who were part of the notorious MS-13 gang, Barker said. After being rescued, Scarlett testified against two gang members, who were convicted but quickly bought their way to freedom.

The gang branded Scarlett by filing down her front teeth diagonally, and the girl refused to smile after arriving at the home. She has since received a dental bridge, benefiting from free medical care the local church arranges.

Scarlett, now 16, is the mother of Jordan, 2, the only boy living in the home. Barker says five current or former residents have given birth while at her charity's group homes.

“We tell them, 'If you don't want to care for your baby, we'll help you,' "" Barker says.

Barker says she has met with prominent figures in the country's two main gangs, MS-13 and Calle 18, to inform them about what she is doing. She said the representatives were business-like and didn't object to her activities.

When Barker met Rut (pronounced “Ruth”), she praised her ability to speak some English. The girl, now 14, explained that she had encountered men from the United States during her forced prostitution by a gang in Mexico.

Anna Rodriguez, founder of the Florida Coalition Against Human Trafficking, says gang activity is a major factor in the rise of sex trafficking in Honduras and some other Central American countries. She says the phenomenon of sex tourism also fuels the trafficking of girls (and increasingly, boys) in Latin American countries.

“For example, you go to Nicaragua or Honduras or El Salvador, and basically taxi drivers, one of the questions they ask you is, 'Why are you here and do you want to have company? Do you want to have someone brought to your hotel room?' "" Rodriguez says. “So sex tourism is something very prominent in these Latin American countries, and that's where the sex trafficking component comes in.”

Rodriguez also notes that some Latin American nations have no legal protections for minors, making it easier for them to be exploited.

“In Guatemala, you see 2-year-olds accompanied by a 5-year-old walking between traffic, trying to sell you old candy for a penny,” she says. “Or you see a 5-year-old at a mine with a little hammer, cutting rocks.”

Providing a haven

Barker was directly involved in the rescue of Marilu when the girl was 12. A neighbor named Grisel, having learned the girl's stepfather planned to sell her into prostitution, rode a bus three hours to reach the group home and banged on the gate in the middle of the night.

Barker told the woman she would need to explain to Marilu's mother that if she took her in that the woman might not see her again. She drove into the mountains and arrived to glimpse Marilu's frightened brown eyes staring from behind a window.

Marilu's mother, so poor she used scavenged newspaper as tissues, gave over custody of her daughter, marking a contract with a thumbprint because she couldn't sign her name.

Two years later, Barker got in touch with Grisel and arranged for Marilu's mother to pay a surprise visit on the girl's birthday.

Sisters Gabriella, 15, and Angie, 13, were both forced into prostitution by their parents, according to Barker. When the girls failed to generate the expected income, their father would hang them by their ankles and beat them as if they were piñatas.

One day in a store, a stranger saw Angie, who was so damaged that infectious material was oozing from her pores. The woman helped both girls take refuge in a church and three days later brought them to Barker.

The sisters, now tall and willowy, are reserved around strangers but among the most outwardly passionate during devotional meetings and church services. Gabriella says she wants to become a chef.

Three residents have arrived within the past two weeks. Asly, 11, had been abused by her father, and a pattern of circular scars on her upper chest testify to the lit cigarettes he pressed against her flesh.

The other newcomers are sisters — Yessenia, 11, and Genesis, 7 — who had been sexually abused by their grandfather, Barker says. Like the other younger residents, they greet strangers with immediate affection, bestowing frequent hugs, smiles and in Yessenia's case, drawings of smiling flowers.

Given their backgrounds, the girls' emotional openness toward unfamiliar guests can be surprising. It all reflects on their relationship with “Mommy Bonnie.”

“They think if I trust you, they trust you,” Barker says of visitors.

In the early stages of the children's home, Barker sought out counseling for the residents. But she learned the girls weren't open to discussing their traumatic pasts with strangers.

Barker says the home's natural support system seems to provide the informal therapy the girls need. ""Pastora Patty,"" the unpaid director, and the Honduran house mothers are available for comfort when nightmares arise, and the girls console each other, Barker says

“They all know they have a story, and they're all very compassionate to each other,” Barker says. “What I've always told them is, 'Your story is your story. If you want to share, you can, but I'll never force you to share your story, even with me.' ""

Julissa, the first girl whom the Barkers received, still resides at the home. She had not been trafficked, but Barker says she had been living on the street with her mother, who was disabled.

When Jim Weaver, a past president of the Lake Wales Breakfast Rotary Club and now its international service chair, met Julissa during a 2013 trip she was perpetually hunched over and didn't engage with strangers. Nearly six years later, the tall, svelte girl remains somewhat shy but moves confidently, often wearing a smile.

During the recent visit, Julissa and other girls from the home take part in an elaborate dance for an anniversary celebration at their church. Wearing a white dress with an indigo vest, Julissa exudes joy as she darts and sways, wielding a tambourine festooned with a rainbow of ribbons.

At home on another night, as Rosy strums an acoustic guitar and leads the girls through the song “Cuanto Nos Ama” (“How He Loves”), Julissa grabs her violin to supplement the raucous singing with scraping notes on the instrument she is still learning.

Barker says Julissa, who will graduate from high school this year, ranks at the top of her class and plans to enter a university and become a doctor.

“She was tall and slump-shouldered and has no confidence, and I've just watched her over six years blossom into this beautiful woman who has turned out to be a medallion scholar for two years running in her school, and she wants to be a medical doctor,” Weaver says. “If I gave you those facts, you'd never put that together. You'd never guess that that would happen. That gives you great gratification.”

Sinthia, a fair-skinned 6-year-old, landed in the government orphanage as an infant, while her 14-year-old mother was in another facility. Both girls arrived at the Choloma home before Sinthia's first birthday, but her mother soon fled and did not return.

Having never known a traditional family, Sinthia thrives in the group home. A wispy dervish, she hurls herself into any jump-roping or soccer game that arises. When the girls engage in group singing, Sinthia propels the words from her tiny mouth with ferocity.

Swings of fortune

The saga of Pahola, who seems younger than 12, is one that sparked widespread publicity in Honduras. Barker says a neighbor shot video of the girl chained in her yard and posted it on Facebook, and Pahola's father and stepmother were eventually prosecuted.

Last September, the Barkers were in Honduras, celebrating their wedding anniversary, when they learned about Pahola's plight and immediately agreed to accept her. Pastora Patty, one of the house mothers, warned Barker that Pahola had endured such intense trauma it might take a long time before she could engage or accept affection.

Pahola was placed in a room with Carolyn, a mischievous girl who, among the Choloma group, most resembles a typical American teenager. Barker later learned that Carolyn provided crucial comfort to Pahola, massaging her feet through the night.

When Bonnie Barker arrived to meet Pahola, the girl immediately called out, “Mommy!” and ran to embrace her.

“Pastora started crying because she was so distant with everybody,” Barker says. “It's like all the barriers broke down in that moment and she felt safe. It's like her youth has been restored.”

Pahola told Barker that while chained in the yard, each night she dreamed of being visited by a blue-eyed Jesus. The girl said the visions prepared her not to be afraid when she met Barker, an unfamiliar woman with blue eyes.

During the Rotarians' visit, Pahola is relentlessly cheerful, always smiling and proudly displaying her proficiency at doing handstands and jumping rope. Within days, though, her story takes a different turn, offering a reminder that placement in the group home can be impermanent.

The same day the Rotarians leave, Barker receives a phone call from a government official. She learns that Pahola's biological mother, who had received public sympathy amid the news about the girls' abuse, now wants Pahola back after being given a new house.

The woman, who has six other children, has said she knew nothing of Pahola's previous abuse, a claim Barker questions. Barker says the woman showed up for a photo opportunity after Pahola's rescue but didn't seek custody of her at the time.

The phone call leaves Barker in tears, and six days later, after she has flown back to Florida, she learns that government officials showed up at Pahola's school and delivered her back to her mother, a development Barker calls “devastating.”

The one consolation is that Pahola, whose mistreatment apparently damaged her vision, received glasses the day before she is removed from the Compelled By Christ home.

Honduras' government-run state orphanages have been closed in recent years. Barker is often asked whether the girls in her group home might be adopted. As she explains, Honduras has not allowed adoption by non-citizens in recent years, but government officials are signaling that the policy might change soon, at least for children recognized as “abandoned.”

Supporters also inquire about getting the girls into colleges in the United States. Barker says the Honduran government won't grant the needed visas out of concern that students would not return to the country.

“If you talk to all of our girls, they love their country and they feel like they can be the ones who change their own society for the better,” Barker says. “So their deep desire isn't to live in the United States or even study (there). Their desire is to make a difference here, which I highly respect.”

Hearts get bigger

As is the tradition during visits from outsiders, Barker gathers the girls and their guests on their final night together to reflect on their experiences as a woman from the local church provides translation. The adults and children sit in a wide circle for an 80-minute session rich in emotion.

Almost all of the older girls voluntarily speak, repeatedly saying Gracias and Dios te bendiga (“God bless you”). Several residents thank Dale Scheerer, a winter resident of Lake Wales who has a background as a chef, for exposing them to unfamiliar cuisine and teaching some cooking skills.

Sindy, the aspiring chef, overcomes her bashfulness to stand and address the Rotarians.

“I love you so much,” she says tearfully. “I hope you come back soon.”

Angie, 13, cries as she says she has calculated how much the Rotarians spent to come and spend time with her and the other girls. Rut, one of the least reserved girls, stands for an extended talk.

“I want to thank you for coming from a very far place from here and leaving your families to spend time with some girls who are not your family,” she says. “Every time a group comes here, we take all of you like fathers, grandfathers, brothers. I hope God is always in your hearts, in the same way we are going to be in your hearts, too.”

Lake Wales Rotarian Larry Bossarte's eyes shine as he turns in a circle to address the girls.

“I just wanted to let all of you know how very special you are — all a little different, which is good, but you're all very special and I don't want you to ever forget that,” Bossarte says. “And I will always remember you, and I hope to come back again.”

Weaver, making his 12th visit to Honduras, says he cherishes seeing how much the girls progress over the six-month intervals between visits.

Octogenarian Cliff Jensen of Lake Wales, the designated “Abuelo,” has also seen the residents grow and mature since his first visit in 2013. He tells the girls he receives more from seeing them than he could possibly give.

“It's true that we left our families back in the United States or Canada, but it's also true that we came to see part of our family,” he says. “For those of you that have been here for a longer period of time, you know Jim and I have been here many times and I have told you many times that I look at you as if you were my grandchildren. I tell people in my hometown that I have a lot of granddaughters in Honduras. Hardly a day goes by that I don't think about you, and I talk to people about how great you are.”

When it's Barker's turn to speak, she says the farewell gatherings are always emotional “because our hearts get bigger every time we meet.”

“My dream always is that my home is a place that people want to be, and you girls make this place a place that people want to be,” Barker says. “So thank you. It's always difficult for me. When I'm in the United States, all I think about is being here. And when I'm here, all my children from there are calling me. But my heart is always in both places.”

1204,Will DOE revoke School Choice scholarships for non-compliant Barnabas Christian school?,"CLOSE TCPalm began investigating the head of a private Christian school on Oct. 31, 2018, the day after viral video exposed CEO Mike Woodbury threatening a student. Find out what we've uncovered. Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATIVE SERIES

On Oct. 31, viral video exposed a basketball coach-cum-private Christian school CEO profanely berating and threatening to deport a student from Haiti.

TCPalm's ensuing investigation of Mike Woodbury raises questions of child welfare, education, immigration, public funding of private schools, and government oversight.

In two-dozen stories so far, we’ve documented his violent criminal history and other wrongdoing that's toppled the once-respected school. (Scroll down for links).

CLOSE Barnabas Christian Academy was run without fanfare for 20 years by two Port St. Lucie couples until ""things went south."" Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

A publicly funded private Christian school, which appears to be boarding foreign students without a license, did not respond to the state's second demand for records and information about that and myriad other issues by a March 21 deadline.

Barnabas Christian Academy likely will have its public funding revoked, as the state threatened in a March 6 noncompliance notice to the school, which moved to a Stuart apartment building after being evicted from a Port St. Lucie shopping center.

TCPalm doesn't know what other consequences, if any, await the school and its directors, as the Department of Education and the Department of Children and Families said they still were working on answers to its questions as of 5 p.m. Friday.

DOE mailed its noncompliance notice to 880 N.W. North River Shores Blvd., a rented apartment complex in Martin County where the school moved March 1 and told parents it would start holding classes for students in grades 6-12 starting March 4.

The school apparently has housed international student-athletes in the ""brand new college dorms” there — built in 1977 — since at least August, according to state records, students and a parent.

TCPalm doesn't know whether school directors Liz Bell or Mike Woodbury received the state's March 6 or Feb. 25 letters, as they don't respond to requests for comment. Until Thursday, no one had collected rain-soaked mail in the open mailbox for more than a week.

Based on the state’s latest public records and answers to TCPalm’s questions, the school appears to be:

More: Overcrowded housing, unsafe transportation, inadequate nutrition

School buses and airport-style shuttle buses — sometimes one or two or a combination of both — have been parked there since November, according to anonymous complaints to the county Dec. 13, Dec. 18 and Feb. 13.

Martin County issued the property owner a March 1 code violation after a Feb. 25 inspection, and was expected to issue a notice to appear in court after a March 20 inspection, but spokeswoman Martha Ann Kneiss has not confirmed that happened.

TCPalm has seen the same two shuttle buses parked in the same area daily throughout March, and they still were there Friday evening.

The county also has not answered TCPalm’s questions, posed repeatedly since March 1, about whether a school is allowed to operate in that residential neighborhood and whether the number of unrelated residents living there is allowable.

Foreign exchange students

On March 8, in response to TCPalm’s questions the week before, DOE confirmed the school did not have a license to board students and said it had asked Bell for information about that. She never responded, DOE confirmed Friday.

With the school facing a forced eviction March 2, most of its estimated 125 students in kindergarten through 12th grade reportedly transferred to other schools. An unknown number of international student-athletes, mostly basketball players, apparently remain.

A 14-year-old Russian boy was among four students interviewed at the apartments Dec. 29 by a Martin County sheriff’s deputy and a DCF investigator, reports say.

The child-welfare check was prompted by a report of unsupervised students “that may be in danger,” reports say. Students told authorities an assistant head coach had been “stopping by daily, but had not been seen or heard from in a few days,” reports say.

Authorities found no wrongdoing and left the juvenile in the care of a 19-year-old Russian student.

“They currently have good living conditions and the place they are staying at is the college dormitory. They stated they are not there against their will and have not been harassed or abused in any way,” the report says. “DCF stated they would follow up again with the athletes.”

DCF ""may impose administrative sanctions or seek civil remedies,"" state law says, but the agency would not say whether there was a follow-up or impending actions.

The Nation brand

The seven two-bedroom units can house 30 people, the deputy wrote; however, the rooms were equipped to sleep 56, with two sets of two-person bunk beds in each room, according to students and photos and videos they and a parent gave TCPalm.

Most of the students had gone home for the holidays on Dec. 29, the deputy wrote, quoting two young men: an 18-year-old from Portugal and a 19-year-old from England.

The students reportedly said they “were recruited to play sports” and attend “The Nation Christian Academy in “St. Lucie West,” which conflicts with several facts.

At that time, the academic side of the school was called Barnabas Christian Academy and had been in the Marketplace at Port St. Lucie shopping center on U.S. 1 since April. Woodbury moved the school there from 1860 S.W. Fountain Blvd. in St. Lucie West.

St. Lucie West also had been the home of The Nation Training Academy, a sports training program run by Bell and Woodbury, but they had vacated that rented space in June 2018, according to public records, which don't reveal a subsequent location.

Maine transplants

The Nation Training Academy opened at 751 N.W. Enterprise Drive in St. Lucie West on June 1, 2017, according to Bell’s announcement in published media reports.

Port St. Lucie Mayor Greg Oravec and other civic leaders attended a July 27 ribbon-cutting ceremony for The Nation and two other businesses in that location.

In 2018, Bell announced an inaugural fundraising dinner and auction of sports memorabilia at the Port St. Lucie Community Center — charging $40 for individuals, $70 for couples and $275 for an eight-person table. She later canceled the April 15 event.

The city refunded the $102 she'd paid toward the $203 rental fee.

Two months later, The Nation vacated the Enterprise Drive location and stopped paying the $3,000 monthly rent, the property owner claims in a Feb. 11 lawsuit seeking $25,000 on the five-year lease.

CLOSE The Nation Christian Academy CEO Mike Woodbury gives TCPalm's Jon Santucci an exclusive video interview to discuss a profanity-laced talk with a student-athlete that was recorded. Jon Santucci, jon.santucci@tcpalm.com

More: Woodbury named in four civil court actions seeking money

Bell and Woodbury have used myriad names for their sports club, which they brought to Florida from Maine in 2017, including The Nation Training Center, The Nation Prep Academy and MBNation. Two of their websites — thenationbasketball.org and thenationbasketball.yuku.com — are now defunct.

Barnabas was renamed ""The Nation” to echo Woodbury's sports brand, but reverted back to its original name since 1998 after his profane tirade drew national criticism.

Woodbury “does not have a good reputation and can lack communication skills due to his hard-line stance and language,” students reportedly told the Martin County deputy. “They look past that, although some athletes in the past have had issues with it.”

1207,Neighbors in shock after murder-attempted suicide in Niceville,"A 3-year-old boy is dead after an alleged murder-suicide attempt. The boy’s father is in critical condition, according to authorities.

Investigators are hoping an autopsy on the toddler, scheduled for Monday, will reveal more about what happened.

The news of the horrific tragedy sent shockwaves throughout a Niceville neighborhood.



“That's terrible, terrible of what happened, you know,” said neighbor Donald Howarth.

Donald Howarth lives across the street from the Franken family.

On Friday, Okaloosa County Sheriff’s investigators say 61-year-old Frederick Franken killed his son, Frederick Franken Jr., and then tried to commit suicide.

“I just can't believe it. It's hard to believe it,” Howarth added.

Franken’s wife was the one to find the pair lying on the floor.

Neighbors reported hearing her screaming after the wife made the discovery.

Howarth told WEAR they don’t know the Frankens well, but say they are a military family.

“They were nice people,” Howard said.

From time to time, they’d give the toddler candy when they saw him outside playing.

“We’d do that because he was a nice little boy,” Howard said.

The news has left everyone in the Millers Run subdivision in disbelief.

“It’s hard to understand how it could happen,” said neighbor Gene Bollin. “I can’t fathom it, it just doesn’t make since.",http://weartv.com/news/local/neighbors-in-shock-after-murder-attempted-suicide-in-niceville,2019-03-17T22:31:58Z,WEAR,Couple,"4990 Mobile Hwy, Pensacola, FL 32506, USA",FL,32506

1213,Police: 6-year-old fatally shoots himself after finding loaded gun,"- Police say a 6-year-old Florida boy died after finding a loaded handgun inside a home and shooting himself in the head.

Miami Gardens Police officer Carolyn Frasier told reporters the shooting happened Saturday morning when the boy was with two caregivers. His parents were not present. She did not release the boy's name.

Frasier said investigators are still determining what happened. No one has been charged, but under Florida law a gun owner must take reasonable steps to assure firearms are not accessible by any child 15 or under.

1215,School staff says boy who threatened Jackson Middle had history of discipline problems,"Titusville police arrested two students after an incident at Andrew Jackson Middle School. (Photo: FILE)

Some teachers at Andrew Jackson Middle School, where police say they foiled a shooting plot three weeks ago, say the boy who allegedly planned the attack had a history of discipline problems.

The school district says, while there were problems, the trouble the boy had gotten into previously was not enough to remove him from the school.

The alleged plot against the Titusville school, located on Knox McRae Drive, was averted on Feb. 21, but was only learned of by FLORIDA TODAY and other news outlets this week.

This latest threat highlights growing tension between efforts by law enforcement and education authorities to identify and stop potentially violent students before an attack, and a child's legal rights to fair treatment and an education.

After a lone gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland last year, more attention is being paid to students' mental health and possible warning signs that could lead to violent behavior.

The former student who carried out the attack on Stoneman Douglas had been disciplined and suspended multiple times and referred to alternative schools, facilities often reserved for students with severe behavioral problems.

Since the shooting on Feb. 14, 2018, the Parkland Commission, tasked with investigating how the shooting happened, has exposed gaps in some Florida school's discipline procedures. The commission has recommended to the Florida Legislature that schools be required to track student's mental health history throughout their school career, and that diversion programs limit the number of referrals a student can receive without more severe punishment.

At the same time, federal and state laws protect students' rights to a public education, and school districts have policies in place to ensure students are treated fairly.

After what happened at Jackson Middle School, some teachers in Brevard have asked the district to review its discipline policies and rethink what constitutes an expellable offense.

Threat not made public

The alleged plot in Titusville was uncovered late last month when two boys — a 14-year-old and a 13-year-old — left notes inside one of the school bathrooms saying they were going to ""shoot up Andrew Jackson."" Also found was a map of the school with buildings labeled in the order in which they allegedly planned to attack.

FLORIDA TODAY is not identifying the students.

Both boys were found off campus and arrested on felony charges of written threats to kill, do bodily injury, or conduct mass shooting, and disruption of an educational institution. The 13-year-old told police he knew where to get a gun, but no weapons were found on campus. It's unclear if the boys had access to weapons or had a plan to acquire them.

Parents, students and staff at the school were informed immediately, but neither the school district nor police publicized the incident.

Titusville Police Deputy Chief Todd Hutchinson said he made the call not to issue a notice the community about the incident because ""there was no credible threat, and the kids did what they did for attention."" He said the department puts out releases ""if an incident occurs in our community and there is a credible threat, or the information and details benefit our citizens.""

FLORIDA TODAY's attempts to contact the boy's legal guardian were unsuccessful.

According to a police report from the Titusville Police Department, the boys gave the notes to a student who walked into the bathroom and told him to take them to the front office. They reportedly fled the campus when the school went on lockdown.

Police said the map indicated the ""order they planned to shoot teachers and students."" The first building, the 13-year-old told investigators, was where a teacher he was mad at worked. The library, he said, he left for last because he ""didn't want to leave any witnesses.""

When administrators received the notes, the school was placed on lockdown for at least an hour while police and a SWAT team searched the school. District officials and teachers have praised those at the school for how they handled the situation.

""Everyone did exactly as they were trained,"" said district spokesman Matt Reed.

Marcy Cipolletti, the school's media specialist, said she and three other students hid in the library for an hour until the lockdown was lifted. She described how she could hear first responders searching the halls and turning the knob to the library door as she reminded her students to stay quiet.

The 14-year-old told police he had met the 13-year-old in the bathroom by chance, and that attacking the school was all the other boy's idea. The 13-year-old told investigators he wanted to ""cause fear in those who bullied him or mistreated him.""

Reed said, prior to the foiled plot, ""there was no documented pattern of threatening behavior that got overlooked and we missed the warning signs.""

Past discipline issues

One Jackson Middle School teacher, Melissa Seli, says, earlier this school year, the younger boy threatened to punch her in the face and had been issued multiple referrals.

""He was there five months later with a plan to kill us,"" she said. ""I was forced to welcome that student into my classroom every day for five months after what should have been an expellable offense.""

""Every school in this county will tell you they have students that should not be there, that threaten the safety and security of everyone on campus,"" she said.

Reed could not discuss the specifics of the boy's discipline history because of federal student-privacy laws, but said the district has reviewed his records, and there is ""nothing in there that was a serious criminal offense.""

""There was nothing that warranted expulsion or being sent to an alternative learning center or anything,"" Reed said. ""The law is very clear you can’t proactively expel a kid. They have due process. Just because someone is emotionally disturbed, you can’t kick them out of school anymore than someone who’s autistic or in a wheelchair.""

Cipolletti said the ""total lack of consequences for outrageous student behavior is appalling.""

In Broward County, where the Parkland shooting unfolded, a diversionary program to keep kids out of the juvenile system has come under intense scrutiny for contributing to schools' lenient discipline culture.

Brevard School Board member Misty Belford said the district already was in the process of reviewing its discipline policy, which was put in place last school year. The policy was put in place with the goal of creating consistent discipline at schools that previously operated on their own discipline plans.

While the policy outlines consequences for different behaviors, Belford said she hears concerns from teachers that disruptive students often are allowed to stay in class and keep misbehaving.

""It is a public school system, and we have to do our best to meet the needs of our students,"" Belford said. ""It's not like we can just make a decision (to expel a student). We have to have documentation and evaluations.""

The error was caught by State Attorney’s Office General Counsel Eddie Evans after the arrest of 72-year-old Robert D. Grose.

“I cannot prosecute him for this. It never occurred to any of us that back in 1971 that it was legal to do this,” said Assistant State Attorney Brian Miller, who oversees the State Attorney’s Office in Wakulla County. “The laws about lewd and lascivious molestation didn’t come about until 1980s.”

The arrest warrant on lewd and lascivious molestation and battery charges was approved by Wakulla Circuit Judge Kevin Carroll. Wakulla County Judge Jill Walker presided over Grose’s first appearance on Thursday morning after his Wednesday arrest. His charges were dropped today.

Miller said Grose could have been prosecuted for an unnatural and lascivious act, but the statute of limitations on the second-degree misdemeanor would have run out about 40 years ago.

“It’s horrible because it’s one of those things where we have victims that came forward after this whole time period but the law didn’t exist at the time,” he said. “It shows how far we’ve come in the past 40 years but it also shows that not that long ago you could do this and get away with it.”

The victim reported to the Sheriff’s Office that in the early 1970s, when he was 8 or 9 years old, he spent summer vacations with relatives in Wakulla and was molested by a 25-year-old man he knew as “Buddy.”

The victim told investigators he hadn’t returned to the county since then. When he did, it was to show investigators where the incidents took place. Based on the information he provided, Sheriff's Office detectives identified ""Buddy"" as Grose.

Initially, he told investigators he did not know the victim, but later said he remembered the young boy visiting many years ago and identified him from a photograph. Grose denied any encounters with the boy, saying, ""I don't think I did that ... not that I know of.""

“What this guy is suspected of is serious,” said WCSO Spokesman Chris Savary. “For our victim it took a lot of guts to step forward and talk about this but here we are. It’s disheartening that this is the way it turned.”

At just 11 years old, Austin Testa has done more for animals in need than most people will in a lifetime.

""It makes me feel happy and great, he said. ""Just believe in yourself and anything can happen.""

The Palm Harbor boy runs his own animal charity called Every Bark Counts. To date, he's raised more than $35,000 dollars to benefit local shelters and rescue groups.

Last month, he received the gofundme.com Kid Hero award.

""I get a little teary eyed,"" said Michelle Testa, Austin's mom. She says her son's flair for philanthropy started on a cold day five years ago, when Austin insisted on buying fleece blankets to donate to the Humane Society.

That unleashed his passion for helping animals, and he started selling popcorn and cotton candy at events to fundraise.

""I said to him, 'why is Every Bark Counts important for you?'"" Michelle recalls. ""He said 'because animals can't speak for themselves.'""

""I get really mad, because people just abuse these dogs for no reason,"" Austin said. ""When they just want to be loved.""

Dogs like Hubble, a rescue recently dumped at a Brooksville shelter. At first, they feared they'd have to put him down, until Austin offered to pay thousands of dollars to save Hubble's leg...and life.

Austin says he wants to run his own animal shelter one day. At this rate, that day may come sooner than later.

""I honestly wouldn't be surprised if that's, like, right around the corner,"" Michelle Testa said.

1219,Police: 5-year-old boy run over by car dies at hospital,"BRUNSWICK, Ga. - A 5-year-old Brunswick boy died after he was accidentally run over by his mother Wednesday night, according to The Brunswick News.

The Georgia State Patrol said it happened around 6:40 p.m. in the parking lot of the Brooklyn Homes housing complex.

According to The Brunswick News, the mother drove into the parking lot and handed snacks to her son, who was playing with his friend. The boy took the snacks, walked away and tripped in front of the car.

The mother was talking to the other child and didn't realize her son fell, investigators said. The boy was rushed to a hospital, where he later died.

1220,Lawsuit details sexual abuse mother says was inflicted on her son at Shalimar Elementary,"FORT WALTON BEACH — The mother of a former Shalimar Elementary School student who was allegedly sexually bullied in a 2016 incident at the school has filed a lawsuit against the Okaloosa County school board, alleging failure to provide ""reasonably safe conditions and supervision"" to the young boy and other students.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory damages for the youngster, now 8 years old, for issues ""including, but not limited to, current and future emotional distress, depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, mental anguish, and medical, therapeutic, and psychiatric expenses.""

The lawsuit was filed Thursday on behalf of a young boy, identified only as ""T.T.,"" who is now being home-schooled, according to Marlon White, an attorney with the Fort Walton Beach office of The Watson Firm. The lawsuit also names the boy's mother, also identified only by initials, as a plaintiff. The mother was at the law office for a Thursday news conference, but did not appear nor speak to reporters.

According to the lawsuit, the youngster was in his first-grade classroom near the end of the 2015-2016 school year when ""he was forced by a male student and a female student to enter a restroom that was located inside (his) classroom."" Once inside the restroom, the lawsuit contends, the male student ""touched and pulled"" the boy's penis, and then forced the boy to reciprocate.

Also according to the lawsuit, the female student pulled down her pants, and she and the male student ""forced Plaintiff T.T. to put his penis inside of the female student's vagina."" T.T. subsequently ""preceded (sic) to continuously penetrate the female student's vagina as instructed,"" before they returned to their seats.

The mother didn't learn of the incident until months later — there is some discrepancy between Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office reports and the lawsuit regarding the exact length of time — but according to one sheriff's office report, the issue came to the attention of authorities in late 2017 after the mother contacted a local pediatrician's office ""due to (the boy) being involved in a sexual incident ... at Shalimar Elementary School.""

""At this time, there is no indication of criminal activity,"" one of the sheriff's office reports reads, in part. ""All of the children ... appear to be experiencing curiosity about their sexuality. There is no immediate danger to (redacted) at this time.""

The Sheriff's Office report indicates that a Florida Department of Children and Families investigator interviewed the students, and the Shalimar Elementary administration was ""advised of the findings of the interview and will take appropriate action.""

Steve Horton, spokesman for the Okaloosa County School District, said prior to the news conference that the district would not comment on pending litigation. Horton was on his way to London on Thursday afternoon, and unavailable for comment following the news conference.

During the news conference, White indicated it was reasonable to conclude there was no criminal aspect to the incident. Rather, he said, the lawsuit is aimed at showing that school officials were ""negligent in the supervision of the child and his peers.""

""When we take our kids to school, we expect a certain level of supervision,"" White said Thursday. Specifically, the lawsuit contends school district officials failed ""to protect (the boy) from sexual bullying,"" and also failed to take steps for student safety, to supervise students, to train teachers, substitute teachers and others ""on monitoring and supervising students,"" and to provide or enforce policies and procedures ""to protect its students from sexual contact and abuse ... .""

Asked how traumatized the child could have been, given that it was months before he mentioned the incident to his mother, White said, ""How do you expect a 6- or 7-year-old child to process that?""

White said the boy's mother had noticed some changes in his behavior prior to him telling her about the incident, but he wouldn't say specifically how the child's behavior had changed. White also would not talk about the nature or extent of any medical or psychological treatment of the youngster.

An exact dollar amount for damages sought in the lawsuit will be worked out as preparation of the case proceeds, White explained. In the coming days, among other actions, the Watson Law Firm plans to investigate classroom protocols regarding bathroom usage, he said.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190314/lawsuit-details-sexual-abuse-mother-says-was-inflicted-on-her-son-at-shalimar-elementary?rssfeed=true,2019-03-14T16:29:55Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

1222,Florida wild turkey crashes through truck windshield and lives,"Bird hits semi traveling 65 mph on Interstate 75 in Sarasota County and is later released.

Nick Gerken was running empty on Wednesday afternoon. He had just left the shop in his big 18-wheeler — it sleeps two comfortably — and was traveling south on Interstate 75. Somewhere between exits 191 and 182 in Sarasota County the darnedest thing happened.

Now this wasn’t a tiny little tap either, like two champagne glasses clinking over candlelight. This was a 20-pound bird flying into a 46,000-pound semi traveling 65 mph, the impact so great the windshield was crushed, no small feat considering the glass wouldn’t break if you punched it.

At first, Gerken thought a vulture on a scouting mission hit the passenger side windshield. It came right out of a tree, just like that, looking like was going to swoop down and land on the side of the highway. At the last second, something spooked it, and bam!

“There was a massive thud,” Gerken said.

Gerken called his boss at D-Trans in Venice and said he was returning. Thinking the bird had somehow flown off after impact, or worse, was now roadkill, he turned around and drove back five miles. When he arrived at the shop he looked in the back of his cab and there it was. Apparently he had picked up a passenger.

“Lo and behold, I’m looking around and I see this pair of feet and legs and big tail sticking out of the nylon netting in the storage area under the bunk,” Gerken said. “Turns out it was a wild turkey.”

Why did the wild turkey cross the road? Who knows? Mating season has just kicked off, the time males chase females, so that could be it. Whatever the reason, it is rare for turkeys to slam into windshields, though not unheard of, as in 2015 a similar encounter took place in Martin County on the Florida Turnpike.

The stunned turkey had been quiet and still while in the cab. When Gerken arrived back at the shop, he tugged on the turkey’s tail feathers to see if it was still alive and “boy did he come to life,” he said.

He opened both doors, hoping it would leave on its own accord, and walked inside to get a vacuum cleaner to sweep up the shards of glass. The turkey did not accept the invitation, so a worker came out and set the bird free.

“He grabbed it by legs and neck and set it on the parking lot. The thing scrambled off. You could tell it had a hurt wing, but it didn’t sit there and whine like it wanted to be put out of its misery.

“I’m an animal lover. I don’t think it’s a problem. I think it will survive.”

According to state wildlife officials, Florida wild turkeys can weigh between 11 and 24 pounds. They can run as quick as 25 mph and fly as fast as 55 mph.

After three similar incidents in Indiana a few years back, Purdue University professor Jeff Burbrink told WSBT-TV in South Bend that “a 30-pound turkey going through a window generates the force of about 500 times the weight of a car, which is pretty much a million pounds of force coming through your windshield.”

The impact was so great that it took hours to vacuum the glass and bird feathers out of the truck.

Gerken, who is 66 and lives in Bradenton, has been a truck driver for 20 years, covering over 2 million miles in his career. He said he runs into some type of animal about once a week. He’s hit hawks and brown eagles in the western states, even clipped turtles unintentionally, sending them squirting out from under his tires like a person flicking a wet watermelon seed with their fingers.

This was his first wild turkey.

He was lucky, too. Had it flown into the driver’s side part of the windshield things could have been much different.

“Today, I’m just glad I’m not lying in the emergency room, still digging glass out of my eyes,” he said.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190228/florida-wild-turkey-crashes-through-truck-windshield-and-lives?rssfeed=true,2019-02-28T19:33:59Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

1224,Florida sixth-grader arrested after dispute over Pledge of Allegiance,"LAKELAND, Fla. - A middle school student in Central Florida was arrested this month after the 11-year-old boy disrupted class by refusing to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, according to local media reports.

The incident happened on Feb. 4 at Lawton Chiles Middle Academy in Lakeland.

Kyle Kennedy, a spokesman for Polk County Public Schools, told the Ledger newspaper that the sixth-grader ""was arrested after becoming disruptive and refusing to follow repeated instructions by school staff and law enforcement.""

The district said the boy was not arrested because he wouldn't participate in the pledge. The students are not required to participate. Police said the boy threatened the teacher.

Local TV station Bay News 9 reported that the student told his substitute teacher ""the flag is racist and the national anthem is offensive to black people.""

When the boy refused to participate, the teacher asked the boy if the United States was so bad, why he didn’t find ""another place to live."" The boy reportedly replied: ""They brought me here.""

Kennedy said the teacher was not aware of the district's policy regarding the pledge and is no longer a substitute teacher with the county.

""I'm upset, I'm angry. I'm hurt,"" Dhakira Talbot, the student's mother, told the station. ""If any disciplinary action should've been taken, it should've been with the school. He shouldn’t have been arrested.""

1228,"In East Naples mosque, heavy hearts over New Zealand attacks and resolve for strength and love","On Friday they prayed, their hearts heavy over the news of a devastating terrorist attack on two mosques in New Zealand.

“We’re all heartbroken over what happened. Those are our brothers and sisters in faith,” said Imam Muhammad Nour of the Islamic Center of Naples. “They’re worshipping just like us.”

At least 50 people were killed and dozens more were injured by a gunman who stormed the Al Noor and Linwood mosques in the city of Christchurch during jummah, the congregational prayer Muslims hold every Friday afternoon.

A suspect, a 28-year-old Australian man, has been charged with murder. Authorities in New Zealand determined that two other suspects who were arrested after the shooting were not linked to the gunman, according to the New Zealand Herald.

The gunman sent copies of a racist, anti-immigrant manifesto to the country’s prime minister and tens of other recipients, the New Zealand outlet reported.

About 75 people attended jummah at the East Naples mosque Friday afternoon, according to mosque president Mohammed Usman. The mosque's usual attendance is about 100.

The Collier County Sheriff’s Office had “enhanced” deputy presence at the mosque on Friday, according to Karie Partington, an agency spokeswoman.

Friday’s sunset and night prayers began with the adhan, a call to worship. About 20 people listened to the trance-like voice of an 11-year-old boy singing the proclamation to prayer in Arabic.

The boy sings: God is the greatest. There is no God worthy of worship but Allah. Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. Come to prayer. God is the greatest. There is no God but Allah.

During Friday’s prayers, Nour told members of the East Naples mosque that although such senseless acts as the New Zealand shootings may be hard to comprehend, they should remain positive.

“This should make us stronger,” he said. “This should make us more united.”

Nour said while Muslim communities ought to be vigilant, “nothing will stop us from practicing our faith.”

“We believe that religion is love,” Nour said. “So we will continue to preach love no matter what. That’s part of the religion. If this world is love-deprived, we have to bring the love back.”

The Islamic Center of Naples received an outpouring of support from the Collier County community. Nour and Usman, the mosque president, said members of local synagogues and churches reached out, offering support and expressing dismay over the New Zealand massacres.

“That’s very comforting to know we have support from the community,” Usman said.

Usman and Nour said the Muslim community in Collier feels safe and welcome. On Feb. 17, the Islamic Center of Naples hosted a grand opening at its campus on County Barn Road in East Naples. Nour estimated about 350 people, including public officials, law enforcement officers and people from across all faiths, attended.

Nour said it is understandable for people to have questions about Islam or any faith that is not theirs.

“That’s why we always say if you want to learn about Islam, go to your local mosque,” he said. “Ask the imam, ask anybody about Islam, why those people hold firm on their religion.”

Nour said he believes people sometimes judge what they don’t know, lack of knowledge can lead to hate, and hatred leads to treating others like enemies.

“We say don’t judge people,” Nour said. “Respect people’s faith, and respect people’s freedom of practicing faith. Respect people’s minds. Muslims should do so, Christians should do so, Jewish people should do so. Everybody should do so.”

1229,Teen cracks egg on head of Australian senator who blamed Muslims for mosque attack,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) - An Australian senator had a raw egg cracked over his head and faces censure from his fellow lawmakers after sparking outrage by blaming Muslim immigration for the New Zealand mosque shootings.

Sen. Fraser Anning came under blistering criticism over tweets on Friday including one that said, “Does anyone still dispute the link between Muslim immigration and violence?”

“The real cause of the bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place,” he said in a statement.

Television cameras caught a 17-year-old boy breaking an egg on Anning’s head and briefly scuffling with the independent senator while he was holding a news conference Saturday in Melbourne.

Police said the boy was arrested but was released without charge pending a further investigation. No motive was offered for the egging.

The government and opposition party agreed to pass a censure motion against Anning over his stance on the Christchurch shootings when Parliament resumes in April.

While such a reprimand is a symbolic gesture, the major parties expect to demonstrate how isolated Anning’s views are among Australia’s 226 federal lawmakers. The major parties’ support ensures the censure motion will be passed by both chambers.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he denounced Anning’s comments.

“In his conflation of this horrendous terrorist attack with issues of immigration, in his attack on Islamic faith specifically — these comments are appalling and they’re ugly and they have no place in Australia, in the Australian Parliament,” Morrison said. “He should be, frankly, ashamed of himself.”

Bilal Rauf, spokesman for the Australian National Imams Council, the nation’s top Muslim group, likened the senator’s views to the rambling manifesto published online by suspect Brenton Tarrant before the slayings.

“When one looks at his statement, it may as well have been an extract from the manifesto of the person that perpetrated these heinous crimes, this act of terrorism in Christchurch,” Rauf said.

Rauf said Anning was unfit for the Senate.

Opposition lawmaker Penny Wong accused Anning of attempting to use the tragedy to grab attention ahead of elections in May.

Anning only received 19 votes in the last election in 2016. But because of a quirk in the Australian electoral system, he was elevated to the Senate by the anti-immigration, anti-Muslim One Nation party after a court ruled that its senator, Malcolm Roberts, had not been eligible to run for election due to his dual citizenship.

Anning later defected from One Nation to another anti-immigration party, then became an independent. Analysts say Anning is unlikely to be re-elected as an independent candidate in May.

Anning was widely condemned for his first speech to the Senate in August advocating reviving a white-only immigration policy and using the term “final solution” in calling for a vote on which migrants to admit into the country. Critics accused him of making a veiled reference to the Nazi extermination of Jews.

The government also announced on Saturday it had banned right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos from touring the country over his social media response to the Christchurch shootings.

Immigration Minister David Coleman said Yiannopoulos’ social media comments are “appalling and foment hatred and division.”

Coleman didn’t specify which comments he was referring to.

Yiannopoulos said on Facebook that attacks like Christchurch happen because “the establishment panders to and mollycoddles extremist leftism and barbaric, alien religious cultures.”

Lawmakers within Australia’s conservative government had been quarreling in recent weeks over whether the firebrand commentator should be allowed to tour Australia this year.",http://www.wfla.com/national/teen-cracks-egg-on-head-of-australian-senator-who-blamed-muslims-for-mosque-attack/1854486748,2019-03-16T19:53:45Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1230,April the Giraffe gives birth to new baby — a healthy boy,"CLOSE April the Giraffe delivered her calf on Saturday, to the delight of an enthralled internet audience. The highly celebrated ungulate of the Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York went into labor before noon. (March 16) AP

BINGHAMTON, N.Y. – April, the world famous mother giraffe, gave birth to her fifth calf, a boy, Saturday.

The calf was born at 12:43 p.m. April went into labor around 11 a.m. Saturday. The newborn giraffe was steady and on its feet by 1:27 p.m., and nursing by 1:51 p.m.

April and her calf were promptly examined by Dr. Tim Slater, the park’s veterinarian. Park owner Jordan Patch said both mom and baby are doing well.

“Success! We are thankful to have a healthy calf on the ground, nursing and bonding with mom. With wild giraffe numbers plummeting annually, every calf born counts,” Jordan Patch, owner of Animal Adventure Park, said.

The calf is April's second since arriving at Animal Adventure Park in 2015. Her fourth pregnancy overall, in 2017, sparked worldwide frenzy and shined a spotlight on the Harpursville park as many waited for one of April's bouncing babies to enter the world.

Calf Tajiri was born on site at the park on April 15, 2017 with over a million people watching the live birth.

Animal Adventure Park announced April was pregnant again in July 2018.

When this latest pregnancy was confirmed, April's due date was merely ""spring 2019,"" but the park was able to make a more precise guess later in the year, expecting the giraffe to give birth sometime in March.

Fans were once again able to follow April's progress throughout her pregnancy on social media, and more than 300,000 tuned in to watch the birth live on YouTube.

Keepers had been noting signs the giraffe was nearing labor as early as Feb. 23.

Now that the calf has arrived, the park's attention turns to finding a name.

Tajiri's name was picked by former giraffe keeper Allysa Swilley, after ""Keeper's Choice"" drew the most votes in a 2017 naming contest. Swilley chose the name Tajiri because she said it meant ""hope"" and ""confidence"" in Swahili.

The name of Tajiri's new companion, Johari, which the park said is Swahili for Jewel, was also chosen through an online contest.

1232,'It kept attacking me:' Belle Glade boy describes being attacked by pit bull,"'It kept attacking me:' Belle Glade boy describes being attacked by pit bull (WPEC)

A 10-year-old boy who was attacked by a pit bull describes the terrifying ordeal he went through.

Gerardo Rendon says he was bitten over and over by a pit bull that just wouldn’t leave him alone.

The boy was attacked in the road near the entrance to Lake Breeze Mobile Home Park where he lives.

His cousin hit the dog as hard as he could with a stick, trying to get the pit bull to back off.

“I was like, 'Help, help! This dog is biting me, I don’t know what to do. I’m like please God help me!'” Rendon said.

Rendon showed CBS12 News his stitches -- more than 300 of them.

The attack was caught on surveillance camera.

Rendon, a fifth grader at Belle Glade Elementary School, got off the school bus with numerous other children shortly before 3 p.m .Thursday and he saw the pit bull nearby.

“I was just worried for everybody else. I just put myself in front of it,” he said.

Rendon says he was worried the dog would attack one of the children around him, so he had to step in.

“I tried to make it come towards me because there was a lot of little kids over there,” he said.

But the pit bull sensed his fear, especially when he tried to run.

“When it started chasing me I’m like what do I do? What did I get myself into? I’m like hopefully this dog doesn’t kill me. I was running, he chased me, he bit me in my ankle, I fell to the ground and then when it got me down, it bit me in my face,” Rendon said.

He says he was bitten at least 10 times on the face, on his left arm and on both legs.

“It bit me in my leg and then I started kicking it and then it got a little bit scared but it kept attacking me. I was just panicking, I didn’t know what to do,” Rendon said.

Gerardo says he got the pit bull in a choke hold, and others were hitting it.

But the dog broke free and came after him again.

“When I seen the dog chasing me behind me, I was just like super-scared,"" Rendon said. ""I’m like am I faster than this dog or is this dog faster than me? Am I gonna let this dog kill me or will I defend myself?”

Rendon managed to get away from the dog and his aunt rushed him to hospital. Deputies arrived and shot the pit bull three times, killing it.

“I just want to thank all the people that tried to help me. Thank God it came towards me and not the little kids ‘cause a little kid might’ve died,” Rendon said.

Gerardo says he went through surgery Thursday night that lasted four to five hours.

If he could’ve done anything differently, he wishes now he had stayed on the school bus and told the bus driver not to let any of the other kids off the bus until the dog was gone.",http://cbs12.com/news/local/it-kept-attacking-me-belle-glade-boy-describes-being-attacked-by-pit-bull,2019-03-16T03:03:00Z,WPEC,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407

A boy was hospitalized Thursday after he was attacked by a pit bull.

It happened moments after he got off the school bus at the mobile home park where he lives.

The attack was caught on surveillance video.

The boy, who neighbors say is 10 years old, was attacked in the road near the entrance of Lake Breeze Mobile Home Park at NW 18th Street and Lake Circle.

The boy was bitten repeatedly in the leg and face.

“It was horrible watching the little boy like that,” neighbor Miriam Mojica said.

Surveillance video from a nearby mobile home shows the pit bull attacking a boy.

The dog lunged at the boy, biting his leg as the frantic boy tries to get away.

Neighbors say the victim is a fifth grader at Belle Glade Elementary.

Video shows him getting off the school bus a little before 3 p.m. when the attack happened.

“The dog went behind him and attacked him from his leg first, that’s when he dropped to the floor, that’s whenever he went to his face, like bit him in his face,” Mojica said.

The victim’s cousin demonstrated how he used a broomstick to hit the dog---using every bit of energy he had---to get the animal off the boy.

“I hit it as hard as I could and that’s when it let go,” he said as he showed CBS12 News how he swung the broomstick like a baseball bat.

The video shows the boy tries to run behind a fence, but the dog follows.

Then, he runs behind a car, but the dog still doesn't give up.

“When I was looking out the window, I saw the pit bull attacking him,” fourth grader Adamaris Medina said.

A girl says she was on the school bus and heard the boy's cries for help.

“I was also crying for him ‘cause he was like yelling help,” Medina said.

One little boy says he threw rocks at the pit bull to try to stop it from attacking the victim.

“I thought it was gonna come after me,” six-year-old Brandon Medina said.

Finally, adults nearby show up and pick the child up and put him in the car. They say the boy is recovering at a hospital with non life-threatening injuries.

When deputies arrived, they say the dog lunged at them, so to protect themselves and others, they shot and killed the pit bull.

Neighbors believe someone dropped the pit bull off in the neighborhood Thursday morning.

They feel the owner no longer wanted the dog, which allowed this tragedy to happen.

1243,Wakulla man charged in 48-year-old molestation case,"A 72-year-old Wakulla man is being accused of the molestation of a young boy almost a half-century ago.

Robert Dewitt Gross of Crawfordville, who was 25 at the time of the alleged incident, was taken into custody Wednesday by the Wakulla County Sheriff’s Office on charges of lewd and lascivious molestation and lewd and lascivious battery after the victim came forward.

The victim reported that in the early 1970s when he was 8 or 9 years old, he would vacation with relatives in Wakulla during the summer and was molested by a man he knew as “Buddy.” He said he hadn't traveled back to Wakulla since then.

The victim provided specific details about the incident and where it happened. He recounted the buildings on the property, that “Buddy’s” parents owned a fiberglass shop, that there was a pool table inside the residence and that his alleged attacker drove a muscle car at the time. During the investigation, a second man contacted investigators reporting being similarly molested by Gross.

WCSO identified Gross as “Buddy,” who confirmed details about the Coleman Road property, the fiberglass shop which remains there and that in the 1970s he drove a Plymouth Road Runner.

He initially told investigators he did not know of the victim but changed his story saying he remembered the young boy visiting during that time period. He later positively identified a picture of the victim.

Gross said when he was younger he experimented with “males” but had stopped when he was caught by his father, according to WCSO. When asked about any encounters with the victim he said. “I’m not going to confess to something I don’t think I did,” according to investigators. “I don’t think I did that … not that I know of.”

1244,Alleged Gambino crime boss Francesco 'Franky Boy' Cali shot and killed in front of New York City home,"CLOSE Prosecutors say the boss of the notorious Gambino family, Frank Cali, was gunned down and killed outside his New York home. USA TODAY

New York City police on Thursday were investigating the bold, fatal shooting of alleged Gambino crime boss Francesco “Franky Boy” Cali outside his Staten Island home.

Officers responding to a 911 call Wednesday night found Cali, 53, who was shot multiple times, police said in a statement. Emergency medical team rushed him to Staten Island University Hospital North, where Cali was pronounced dead.

""There are no arrests and the investigation is ongoing,"" police said in a statement.

Federal prosecutors have described Cali as a top leader of New York’s notorious Gambino crime family. His murder marked the most notable killing of a Gambino boss since 1985, when Paul Castellano was shot dead in front of the Sparks Steak House in Manhattan. Cali lived less than a half-mile away from Castellano’s Staten Island mansion.

Witnesses told the New York Post and other local media the gunman fled the scene in a blue pickup.

“I’ve seen the (mob) movies,"" neighbor Prashant Ranyal, 39, told the Post. ""But I’ve never seen any activity that we feel at all that there’s something strange about this area.""

Cali was a native of Sicily, and his wife is the niece of Gambino head John Gambino.

The New York Daily News and other media outlets in the city have reported that since 2015 Cali had ascended to the top spot in the gang, although he never faced a criminal charge making the claim.

Cali's only mob-related criminal conviction came a decade ago, when Cali pleaded guilty in an extortion conspiracy involving a failed attempt to build a NASCAR track on Staten Island. He was sentenced to 16 months in federal prison and was released in 2009.

The Gambino family was once among the most powerful criminal organizations in the United States, but federal prosecutions in the 1980s and 1990s sent its top leaders to prison and diminished its reach.

Iconic Gambino leader John Gotti died in federal prison in 2002. Gotti's brother, Gene, 71, was released from prison last year after serving almost 30 years for dealing heroin.

Another former leader of the group, Carmine John ""The Snake"" Persico Jr., died last week while serving a 139-year prison sentence. He was 85.

1245,"Boy, 11, to undergo surgery after attempting parkour stunt","A Clay County 11-year-old boy is recovering after breaking his arm doing an activity that has become increasingly popular on YouTube.

It’s called parkour. It’s kind of like a sport in which participants do sometimes death-defying activities like jumping between buildings and running up walls, similar to what a stunt person might do in a movie.

On Wednesday, News4Jax spoke with Kristian Barnett, who will have surgery Thursday after breaking his arm while trying out parkour in his backyard on Monday.

""I was outside, got off my trampoline,"" Kristian said. ""Saw a log, went to jump off.""

The log he jumped on snapped.

""It hurt a lot, felt like somebody stabbed me in my arm,"" said Kristian, who now has a cast on his arm.

Teresa Barnett, Kristian's mother, said he had decided to go out and play -- instead of playing video games -- when he broke his arm.

""Basically, I had to move his arm and kind of adjust it to be somewhat straight, lay it on his chest so we could get up off the ground,"" she said.

Kristian said he had seen parkour videos and wanted to try it out.

""I thought it was awesome,"" he said.

His mother, who has spent a lot of time in the hospital this week, said she has also watched the videos.

""They’re scary,"" she said. ""Some of them really jump pretty far over buildings, on the sides of walls, downstairs.""

The log that Kristian jumped on was not high off the ground, unlike the roofs that people jump off and the tall walls that people scale in many parkour videos.

For those who don't think the parkour phenomenon is that popular, the videos that Kristian had been watching have gone viral with millions of views. In fact, News4Jax came across a website called Urban Evolution, from the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, that offers parkour classes for children ages 4 to 14.

Kristian will undergo surgery Thursday at Wolfson Children’s Hospital to put surgical nails in his arm and repair the break.

1246,Teens accused of planning shooting at Titusville middle school,"TITUSVILLE, Fla. - Two teenage boys are accused of leaving notes threatening a mass shooting at Andrew Jackson Middle School, according to the Titusville Police Department.

The investigation began Feb. 21 when a student handed an administrator a note found in the bathroom, which prompted a lockdown at the school.

Police said they went to the 500 wing boys' bathroom and found two notes. Each note appeared to be written by a different student and said that the student was ""going to shoot up Andrew Jackson Middle."" There was also a map of the school with each wing labeled a number one through six, in addition to a drawing on the mirror of a rectangle with ""AJMS"" written inside and the word ""kaboom"" written over it, according to the affidavit.

The 13-year-old and 14-year-old boys who were named in the notes were not on campus when the lockdown was put in place, but they were found at a home less than a mile away, the report said.

The 13-year-old boy told police that he and his friend left the notes in the bathroom. He said the numbers of the wings of the school corresponded with the order in which they planned to shoot the people inside, according to the affidavit.

The teen said he intended to make people who had bullied or mistreated him afraid and said there was a teacher who had upset him in the building he wanted to shoot first, police said. The boy said he didn't have a gun but knew where to get one.

The 14-year-old student said the plan was the other boy's doing, although he did admit to writing the note and leaving the school with the other boy once the lockdown was put in place, according to the affidavit. That boy said he didn't have a gun and would not know where to get one.

Both boys are facing charges of written threats to kill and disruption of a school function.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Hugo Chavez's socialist revolution was good to Emanuel Andrade, but now that authorities in the United States and Europe are working to isolate embattled President Nicolas Maduro, he is among the Venezuelans whose opulent lifestyle in South Florida may be coming to an end.

The 22-year-old Venezuelan migrant wasn't afraid to use social media to brag about his flights in private jets with Louis Vuitton bags. Local Venezuelans know about his rest and relaxation at sea in yachts and his shopping sprees at Miami's Design District boutiques.

His 80,000 followers on Instagram know he loves puppies, wine and traveling with his boyfriend Carlo Magno, and that there is nothing he loves more than his horses. He has a horse tattooed on his left arm, and he also he also has a horseshoe on his right arm.

""A horse is not just a horse, he is sanity, he is happiness,"" said a graphic he shared a few years ago. ""He is a teacher, a therapist, a best friend.""

Andrade, a former Olympic equestrian, was obsessed with his show-jumping horses in Wellington. This week, U.S. authorities sold his pride and joy, the ""Hardrock Z"" stallion, for $282,000. The brown stallion was among his family's 14 horses sold during an online auction for $2,086,500.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury will be taking the money. The horse had been a part of Andrade's life since he was a boy. He rode it when he competed at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the International Federal for Equestrian Sports (known as FEI from its French name) World Equestrian Games and the FEI Nations Cup finals.

It was likely that as a teenage equestrian rider, he understood that the wealth that he was enjoying was thanks to his father's relationship with Chavez. In 2014, he used Twitter to send a message to Chavez nearly a year after his death.

""I have missed you so much these past days, [Chavez],"" Andrade wrote to his more than 100,000 followers. ""You were always a very special person with me and my family. We love you. Forever.""

Chavez's socialism made it possible for a former bodyguard to have his son living the same lifestyle as Steve Jobs' daughter Eve Jobs and Bill Gates' daughter Jennifer Gates, two equestrians who are Wellington regulars.

Andrade benefited from Chavez's guilt. An injury his father suffered during a game with Chavez at the presidential palace sealed his fate. Investigators say it was Chavez who granted him the access to power that prosecutors say resulted in bribes.

Andrade's 54-year-old father, Alejandro Andrade, lost his right eye during a game of chapita, the Venezuelan street baseball game that uses metal bottle caps instead of balls. His father, later known as Lt. ""Chapita,"" was the batter and Chavez was the pitcher.

Chavez and Andrade were graduates of the Military Academy of Venezuela. Chavez was in the class of 1975 and Andrade was class of 1987. Chavez had Andrade's support during the unsuccessful coup of 1992 and was his bodyguard when he became president in 1998.

Chavez rewarded his loyalty with a job as the president's private secretary. Without any experience in finance or economics, Andrade became Venezuela's national treasurer in 2007. He held the post for three years and was the president of the Economic and Social Development Bank of Venezuela until 2010.

After Chavez declared there was an ""economic war"" in Venezuela, Alejandro Andrade began to flaunt his wealth in Palm Beach County and his son followed in his footsteps on social media.

At 15 years old, Emanuel Andrade scored a win at the Hampton Classic in Bridgehampton, New York, and at the $25,000 A-T Children’s Benefit Grand Prix at the Palm Beach International Equestrian Center in Wellington.

Despite living like millionaires, the Andrade family wasn't happy. In 2016, Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office deputies responded to a domestic violence incident. According to deputies, Emanuel Andrade said he had pulled out a knife on Alejandro Andrade during an argument because he was tired of his father ""controlling him.""

It will be hard for his father to try to control him now. He was charged with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and after he accepted a plea deal, U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg sentenced him to 10 years in prison in November.

With attorney Curtis B. Miner, a Harvard Law School graduate based out of Coral Gables, representing him in court, Andrade read a statement saying he felt ""enourmous pain and remorse"" about his participation in a $1 billion bribery scheme to defraud the Venezuelan government.

On Monday, he started to serve his sentence. This week's online auction is just the beginning of the Andrade's lifestyle change. U.S. authorities will continue to sell their real estate properties in Palm Beach County, 35 watches and 10 cars.

The list of watches includes a Rolex Platinum, a Patek and an Audemars Piguet, and the list of cars includes a Porsche Cayenne and a Mercedez Benz AMG G63. The real estate properties include two mansions on Sunnyland Lane in Wellington and a home in Delray Beach.

1252,Tallahassee breweries win big on the national stage | Opinion,"Danny Aller (Photo: Your Turn)

Some of you may know me from my columns in the Limelight about the area craft beer scene. But today I'm just writing as a fan of #TLHBeer.

Because in the last week, our area breweries did some things on the state, national and worldwide craft beer scene to make every area craft beer fan feel blessed to be surrounded by so much talent.

Last Saturday in Tampa, Proof Brewing Company — our oldest and biggest brewery in town — was invited to pour in a prestigious annual event called ""Hunahpu's Day,"" which is put on by Florida brewing giant Cigar City. Also invited? Ology Brewing, Tallahassee's newest and smallest brewery.

And boy did those two make a gigantic splash.

Proof and Ology finished 1-2 and 2-1 for the festival's Top 2 awards — Best Beer and Best Overall Brewery — among about 200 breweries from around the world.

The breweries Proof and Ology beat were not just from Florida. Or just the United States. The world.

Ology was named Best Overall Brewery. It also earned second best beer for its Passionfruit, Blood Orange, Raspberry Juice Lab Berliner Weisse sour.

Proof, meanwhile, won Best Beer for its Key Lime Pie Evil Kiss Berliner Weisse sour and was also voted second best overall brewery.

This was the fourth year in a row that Proof medaled at Hunahpu's Day, but to have a Tallahassee sweep like that? That's huge for both breweries. Like, massive.

But it's even bigger for Tallahassee as a whole, because it plants our city's craft beer flag firmly in the ground for everyone to see.

And it gets better.

The Big Bend beer scene's recent trophy barrage actually started a week earlier, when Deep Brewing Company took home two medals from the Best Florida Beer competition in Tampa. Deep earned a gold for REEFraction, a double IPA, and a silver for Jack Brown, an English-style brown ale. And when the judges pooled all the gold medal winners in the state to decide Best Overall Beer in Florida, REEFraction won third place.

That's crazy — crazy-awesome, that is. But there's still more.

Also snaring a bronze in the competition was Apalachicola's Oyster City Brewing Company, which won for its Red Right Return Amber Ale, marking its first Best Florida Beer medal.

Area craft beer fans took notice of these wins, just like the rest of the world took notice of our craft brewery scene in a matter of two weeks.

""It's not just our Tallahassee bias — the local brewers are disproportionately successful at these events. #shoutout,"" tweeted Tallahassee attorney Tony Glover, who specializes in alcoholic beverage laws.

It makes me really excited for what's to come from these emerging area all-stars, including Tallahassee's other two breweries: Lake Tribe Brewing and GrassLands, which has previously won multiple Best Florida Beer medals.

After the week our area craft beer scene just had, you should consider getting out there to explore and drink local — whether you're currently into craft beer or not.

1253,"Orange County teacher accused of molesting student volunteered with Cub Scouts, records say","0 Orange County teacher accused of molesting student volunteered with Cub Scouts, records say

ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - Records show an Orange County elementary school teacher accused of molesting a student spent time at at least four different schools.

WFTV uncovered documents that show he even listed himself as a Cub Scout leader in Orlando.

Julio Soto walked out of jail Thursday night after investigators said one student claims he molested her at Castle Creek Elementary.

TRENDING NOW:

Since the accusation was made, several potential victims have come forward, school officials said.

Investigators said they have not had any potential victims come forward from any other schools at this time and they only know about the potential victim from Castle Creek Elementary.

That school is where Soto was working most recently, but Friday, WFTV learned he claims he spent time in at least three other schools, as well.

Soto's resume for the Orange County School District says he had worked at three different schools before getting his most recent job as a fifth-grade teacher.

He wrote that he had mandatory observation hours at East Lake Elementary from September 2009 to December 2010 and interned there from January 2011 to April 2011.

During that time, he said he ""helped students in 1st and 5th grade"" and ""taught a class in 3rd grade.""

Then from August 2011 to June of 2012, Soto wrote that he was a fifth-grade teacher at Bonneville Elementary School. In the 2012-13 school year, Soto listed that he was a fifth-grade teacher at Pinar Elementary School.

Soto's resume also lists that he was a ""Cubmaster and Webelos den leader for Bonneville and East Lake Elementary"" and a ""committee member"" for Troop 219 Scouts in Orlando.

WFTV contacted the Boy Scouts of America’s Central Florida Council to confirm if Soto volunteered for them, but we haven't heard back.

No one answered at a home Soto listed as his address in Orange County, but WFTV reporter Samantha Manning saw a bumper sticker that says ""Keep Calm. I'm a Boy Scouts Leader"" on a truck in the driveway.

Soto is now on administrative leave with the school district while the investigation continues.

The Orange County Sheriff's Office said any parents out there from any school who have information they want to share about Soto should contact them and a detective will follow up.

Bailey Chase for years has played the character that viewers often dislike.

The Naples native and father of three said he's enjoying his new roles, including the new Netflix Original movie ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" that premiered earlier this month.

Chase, 46, gained prominence for his acting from 2012 to 2017 on the Western crime series ""Longmire,"" in which he played an ambitious Wyoming sheriff's deputy, Branch Connally.

“More than anything, the arc that I got to do on 'Longmire,' that character Branch, he hit all the notes,"" Chase said in a recent telephone interview.

""It gave me a confidence as an actor that I could do anything, I could play good. I could play bad. And by portraying these newer characters, that’s how I connect with the audience more. Then they start rooting for you.”

In his latest role, based on a true story, Chase plays Cory Snyder, the father of Amberley Snyder, a successful rodeo barrel racer who returns to the sport after a car crash.

In real life, Bailey and his wife, Amy, have three children: twin 2-year-olds (a boy and a girl) and a 4-year-old daughter who was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Chase was still shooting ""Longmire.""

“For me as a dad, to play that role, as an actor, you go to those places where I’m imagining my girl in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair,"" Bailey said.

“Since 'Longmire' and becoming a dad, I feel like I can play anything.”

Happy Mother’s Day to all the amazing Mama’s out there (miss you Mom) and to my beautiful wife for these 3 little backseat drivers ❤️🚌 pic.twitter.com/dln0pQr4cT — Bailey Chase (@Bailey_Chase) May 13, 2018

Born in Chicago, he grew up in Naples from age 4 through his freshman year at Naples High School. He transferred to the Bolles School in Jacksonville, where he played football and baseball and graduated from the private school before heading to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

After graduating from Duke with a bachelor's degree in sports psychology, Chase said, he decided to fulfill ""a boyhood dream"" and headed to Los Angeles instead of New York.

""I came out here, being a Florida boy,"" Chase said. ""The climate was a little bit better. I was living at the beach, waiting tables and going to acting class.”

He eventually traveled overseas to become a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, to study Shakespeare.

When he returned to the U.S., he landed a role on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" a television series that ran from 1997 to 2003. For the next few years, Chase portrayed Chris Robert Hughes on the soap opera ""As The World Turns.""

He co-starred as ""Becks"" Scott in the ABC comedy-drama ""Ugly Betty,"" which ran from 2006 to 2010, and on the TNT series ""Saving Grace,"" which ran between 2007 and 2010.

But his most notable role came in 2012, on ""Longmire,"" which began on A&E channel and later was presented on Netflix. Robert Taylor starred as Walt Longmire, a stoic, rugged, no-nonsense sheriff; the actor revealed his Australian accent away from the camera, Chase said.

""He’s a good dude,"" Chase said of Taylor. ""It was a strong cast. We were all distinctly different.”

Longmire"" also co-starred Katee Sackhoff, Lou Diamond Phillips and Gerald McRaney, known for his TV roles on ""Major Dad"" and ""Simon & Simon"" that Chase said he grew up watching.

Bailey Chase for years has played the character that viewers often dislike.

The Naples native and father of three said he's enjoying his new roles, including the new Netflix Original movie ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" that premiered earlier this month.

Chase, 46, gained prominence for his acting from 2012 to 2017 on the Western crime series ""Longmire,"" in which he played an ambitious Wyoming sheriff's deputy, Branch Connally.

“More than anything, the arc that I got to do on 'Longmire,' that character Branch, he hit all the notes,"" Chase said in a recent telephone interview.

""It gave me a confidence as an actor that I could do anything, I could play good. I could play bad. And by portraying these newer characters, that’s how I connect with the audience more. Then they start rooting for you.”

In his latest role, based on a true story, Chase plays Cory Snyder, the father of Amberley Snyder, a successful rodeo barrel racer who returns to the sport after a car crash.

In real life, Bailey and his wife, Amy, have three children: twin 2-year-olds (a boy and a girl) and a 4-year-old daughter who was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Chase was still shooting ""Longmire.""

“For me as a dad, to play that role, as an actor, you go to those places where I’m imagining my girl in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair,"" Bailey said.

“Since 'Longmire' and becoming a dad, I feel like I can play anything.”

Born in Chicago, he grew up in Naples from age 4 through his freshman year at Naples High School. He transferred to the Bolles School in Jacksonville, where he played football and baseball and graduated from the private school before heading to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

After graduating from Duke with a bachelor's degree in sports psychology, Chase said, he decided to fulfill ""a boyhood dream"" and headed to Los Angeles instead of New York.

""I came out here, being a Florida boy,"" Chase said. ""The climate was a little bit better. I was living at the beach, waiting tables and going to acting class.”

He eventually traveled overseas to become a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, to study Shakespeare.

When he returned to the U.S., he landed a role on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" a television series that ran from 1997 to 2003. For the next few years, Chase portrayed Chris Robert Hughes on the soap opera ""As The World Turns.""

He co-starred as ""Becks"" Scott in the ABC comedy-drama ""Ugly Betty,"" which ran from 2006 to 2010, and on the TNT series ""Saving Grace,"" which ran between 2007 and 2010.

But his most notable role came in 2012, on ""Longmire,"" which began on A&E channel and later was presented on Netflix. Robert Taylor starred as Walt Longmire, a stoic, rugged, no-nonsense sheriff; the actor revealed his Australian accent away from the camera, Chase said.

""He’s a good dude,"" Chase said of Taylor. ""It was a strong cast. We were all distinctly different.”

Longmire"" also co-starred Katee Sackhoff, Lou Diamond Phillips and Gerald McRaney, known for his TV roles on ""Major Dad"" and ""Simon & Simon"" that Chase said he grew up watching.

1257,"He’s just like any other boy, except that he let his hair grown down to his back. Here’s why he did it.","Please enable Javascript to watch this video

WEST JORDAN, Utah – A Utah boy is helping other kids by growing out and giving away his own hair - with a personal reason for his unique way of giving back. On Thursday afternoon, Morgan Gero indulged in a round of Apex Legends in his bedroom as one hand furiously clicked away on the keyboard and the other made quick movements with the mouse.

Morgan enjoys video games, and a quick look around his room shows something else he loves – Star Wars.

""The force is strong with this one,"" bold lettering states above his window as a life-size cutout of Anakin Skywalker stares down from one of the walls.

It's clear Morgan is like any other 12-year-old boy – but some people mistake him for a girl. It's because Morgan's hair flows down to the middle of his back.

""It's annoying when people just think I'm a girl,"" he said. ""Usually when I go into the boys bathroom, people kind of look at me funny. Even the adults look at me funny. They're like, 'What are you doing in this bathroom?'""

What Morgan's doing is growing his hair out for kids who lost theirs because of medical issues and treatments.

""Those kids who really need hair,"" he said. ""So yeah. I could help them out.""

After two years, Morgan's locks have reached the right length to donate to Wigs for Kids.

His mother, Sandrine Gero, took Morgan to chop off 12 inches Thursday afternoon.

""Alright, you ready?"" hairdresser Marion Gallagher asked before she separated the hair into small pony tails, and snipped them off one-by-one.

The process was pretty painless, and important – especially for a kid who has suffered some serious medical problems of his own.

""I was born earlier than I was supposed to [be born],"" Morgan said. Sandrine said she went into labor at 27 weeks. Morgan lived his first weeks of life in the NICU, and Sandrine said he almost didn't survive.

""It was really hard. It was very traumatic for both me and my husband,"" Sandrine said. ""We did not know if he was actually going to live.""

Morgan beat the odds and didn't suffer any lifelong health conditions.

He knows other kids like him aren't as lucky, and he said he wants ""to help kids feel normal.""

This isn't the first time Morgan has donated his hair.

Four years ago, he began to grow his hair out. He donated it for the first time two years ago. Then, he started the process again.

Even though Morgan said it will be nice to not get any more weird looks with his new short haircut, he plans to keep going.

Morgan will grow his hair out a third time as he continues to give back to this cause.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/03/15/hes-just-like-any-other-boy-except-that-he-let-his-hair-grown-down-to-his-back-heres-why-he-did-it/,2019-03-15T18:37:57Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394
1258,'That boy was my life': Flag from coffin of U.S. airman who died returned to family during ceremony,"0 'That boy was my life': Flag from coffin of U.S. airman who died returned to family during ceremony

WINTER GARDEN, Fla. - It was a reunion over a decade in the making.

Air Force Staff Sergeant Mike Long died at the age of 30 on his father's birthday in a motorcycle accident while he was on leave in Central Florida.

Mike's father, Charlie Long, had full custody of him since he was a toddler. The flag that was presented on Mike's coffin was presented to his mother after his death.

TRENDING NOW:

At some point, the flag was abandoned. The flag wasn't recovered until someone was cleaning out a home in Winter Garden in January. The finders turned the flag over to the American Legion with a handwritten note in hopes that it would make its was back to family.

Those hopes were answered after officials were able to track Charlie down in Ohio.

""Everything, it means everything,"" said Charlie Long. ""That boy was my life.""

Charlie had a duplicate flag, but it was lost in a house fire years ago.

""I was very elated to know that someone would go through all the trouble to get it back to us,"" said Long.

Just weeks after Staff Sergeant Long died, his fiance gave birth to their son, Trip.

Now 11-years-old, Trip says his dad is a hero.

""It makes me feel proud that I came from that,"" said Trip Long. ""That I'm related to that.""

The family has always been transparent with Trip about what happened to his father. The reuniting of the flag makes him a little closer to the dad he didn't get a chance to meet.

""It makes me feel like he did something great and that maybe I can do something like that,"" said Trip.

The family said that the flag and medals will be treasured and protected. The family is also hoping that an iron cross that was located at the sight where Long died also finds a way back to the family.

1259,"Lawsuit alleges first-grade student forced to have sex with a peer, school board negligent","against the Okaloosa County School Board alleges the board was negligent in supervising students in a first-grade classroom.

The suit, filed March 14, claims a seven-year-old Shalimar Elementary student was coerced into a bathroom by two other students (a boy and a girl) where he was forced to engage in sexual acts, including sexual intercourse - the whole time, left unsupervised.

""With regard to how long they were in the bathroom, I submit to you this: They were in there long enough to go in there and take their pants off, touch each other and perform sexual acts,"" said attorney Aaron Watson. ""So, from our opinion, it was too long.""

attorneys representing the boy told Channel 3's Hannah Mackenzie the alleged incident took place in 2016 but was not reported until later.

""How do you expect a six and seven-year-old child to digest that?"" asked Marlon White. ""How do you expect a six and seven-year-old child to reconcile what's just happened to them and adequately explain it to their parents?""



Before this lawsuit was made public, we caught up with Okaloosa County School Superintendent, and asked about the district's policy on investigating claims like this one. He says the key is transparency.

""The very first thing that we're doing is we're calling the [Department of children and families] hotline - that's first and foremost,"" said Chambers. ""Secondly, we're going to be communicating with our sheriff's office through our [school resource officer]. Our principals know from there, to contact the human resources department, then finally, we make sure that the parents are contacted.""

Chambers has only served as superintendent for six weeks. He replaces , who was suspended earlier this year by Governor Ron DeSantis after it was alleged she mishandled child abuse allegations.

According to white, his client is no longer enrolled in the school district. He is being homeschooled.

""We don't expect the schools and teachers to prevent everything from happening,"" said White. ""However, they have a duty and it's reasonable to expect and they should be supervised enough to where things like this should not happen to elementary school-aged kids.""

Monetary damages aren't specified in the lawsuit, but compensation for attorney fees and psychiatric diagnoses and treatment is mentioned.

The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office was brought in to investigate. They closed their case without making any arrest.

1260,"Boy, 11, bitten by shark off Stuart Beach","An 11-year old boy is recovering after he was bit by a shark near Stuart Beach this week.

Kael Dewey and his family, who are visiting from Iowa, were taking a dip in the ocean, when their spring break suddenly turned frantic.

CBS12 News caught up with the Dewey family Thursday as they arrived at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter to take in a spring training game. They’re big Cardinals fans.

After the week they’ve just had, they need to have some fun.

“I don’t really know how to explain it, it just hurt a lot,” Kael Dewey said, describing the feeling of being bitten by a shark.

Kael Dewey, on crutches and sporting a wrap on his right foot, said he and his mom had taken their boogie boards out one last time.

“When we started to head in, all of a sudden I felt something grab my leg,” he said. “And then I just started screaming, and lifted my feet out of the water.”

Bringing his feet above the surface was intentional.

“He said he remembered from watching a shark movie on TV that sharks are attracted to blood,” said Jess Dewey, Kael Dewey's mother. ""It was pretty scary. I was just afraid that my child was going to go under water, and I wouldn’t see him come back up.“

Dewey said bystanders rushed to help get Kael Dewey out of the water. She said Martin County Ocean Rescue quickly arrived and made a tourniquet.

Then, medics transported Kael Dewey to the hospital, where he had stitches on top and bottom of his foot.

“Tore it up pretty good, but it will heal,” said Matt Dewey, Kael Dewey’s father.

In fact, Kael Dewey should make a full recovery, although his parents remain concerned about infection.

“We’re thankful, thankful the way it turned out,” said Matt Dewey, who along with his wife and sons, expressed gratitude to all who helped his son.

“Just lucky that I still have my foot,” Kael Dewey said. “And, that I’m still alive.”

When CBS12 News visited Stuart Beach on Thursday, Ocean Rescue lifeguards flew red ""no swimming"" flags following a shark sighting.

Brad Beckett, the Ocean Rescue chief for Martin County Fire-Rescue, said sharks have been migrating the past couple weeks, resulting in several closures to swimming.",http://cw34.com/news/local/boy-11-bitten-by-shark-off-stuart-beach,2019-03-15T00:17:16Z,WTVX,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407

At 3 p.m. Monday afternoon, Christopher Freeman told police he received a FaceTime call from his young son.

Freeman said the boy, a student at Bear Lakes Middle School in West Palm Beach, Florida, was crying and said he had been ""slammed"" by a teacher. Then the call went dead.

An hour later, Freeman, 27, showed up at the school - carrying a loaded semiautomatic gun.

""I want to see the guy who slammed my son,"" Freeman said, according to a police report. ""I've got something for him.""

The school district's police force put Bear Lakes on lockdown, and Freeman was arrested and charged with possession of a firearm on school grounds, aggravated assault with a weapon and disrupting a school function. His bond was set at $75,000, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported.

According to an arrest report from the Palm Beach County schools police, an assistant principal at the middle school had called Freeman that afternoon to talk about the incident involving his son.

""If this isn't my son, you're all dead,"" Freeman said when he answered the phone, the principal later told police.

Freeman told the assistant principal he was on his way to the school. The principal notified police, and an officer met Freeman in the main hallway inside the middle school, according to the arrest report. Freeman was in a wheelchair, and the officer began escorting him into the main office.

""You're going to need more than what you've got because of what I've got,"" Freeman said, according to police.

That's when the officer noticed a ""large firearm"" tucked into Freeman's pants on the right side of his body, officials said. Freeman was ""visibly upset"" and ""yelling and screaming,"" according to the report.

The officer then diverted Freeman to a breezeway outside the main office and put the school on a lockdown.

""You ain't touching me,"" Freeman reportedly said when the officer inquired about a gun and asked to search him.

Backup arrived, officials said, and found on Freeman an AK-47 Mini Draco with a loaded, 30-round extended magazine. The gun had a bullet in the chamber, police said.

Freeman told authorities he purchased the gun from a friend about a year ago to use for protection and had no intention to harm anyone, according to the arrest report.

MELBOURNE, Australia - MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - An Australian judge has sentenced the most senior Catholic to be convicted of child sex abuse to 6 years in prison for molesting two choirboys in a Melbourne cathedral more than 20 years ago.

Victoria state County Court Chief Judge Peter Kidd on Wednesday ordered Cardinal George Pell to serve a minimum of 3 years and 8 months before he is eligible for parole.

Pope Francis' former finance minister was convicted in December of orally raping a 13-year-old choirboy and indecently dealing with the boy and the boy's 13-year-old friend in the late 1990s. The assaults happened just months after Pell became archbishop of Melbourne. A court order had suppressed media reporting the news until last month.

The 77-year-old denies the allegations and will appeal his convictions in June.

1270,Lawsuit claims boy's leg crushed on 'E.T. Adventure' ride at Universal Orlando,"CLOSE If you're going to drop your hard-earned cash at a theme park, being an informed consumer is imperative, and this rundown is a great place to begin. 10Best Editors, USA TODAY 10Best

A lawsuit claims an 11-year-old boy visiting from Brazil had his foot and leg crushed at the end of the E.T. Adventure ride at Universal Studios in Orlando.

The Orlando Sentinel reports the boy’s mother Roberta Perez sued in Orange County Circuit Court and seeks at least $15,000 in damages.

Attorney Edmund Normand said it appears Tiago Perez’s left foot got stuck between the ride’s vehicle and the cement offloading area, breaking multiple bones in his toes, foot and leg.

The lawsuit claims Universal knew that the “design, manufacture, testing, construction and/or operation” of the ride “created an unreasonably dangerous ride.”

The lawsuit noted that the child didn’t speak English and couldn’t read any warning signs during his visit to the theme park on Jan. 31.

The boy has been a cast since the incident and has not been able to attend school because of his injuries, according to Normand.

The ""E.T. Adventure"" ride has been in operation Universal Orlando since it opened in 1990.

Universal declined comment.

1273,11-year-old Florida boy arrested for confrontation after refusal to stand for Pledge,"The Lawton Chiles Middle Academy sixth-grader allegedly told a substitute teacher that “the flag is racist and the national anthem is offensive to black people.”

LAKELAND — An 11-year-old Lawton Chiles Middle Academy student was arrested Feb. 4 and charged with disrupting a school function and resisting arrest without violence following a confrontation with school officials and a law enforcement officer.

The incident happened after his refusal to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and his refusal to stand after ordered by the substitute teacher.

Polk County Public Schools spokesman Kyle Kennedy said the sixth-grader “was arrested after becoming disruptive and refusing to follow repeated instructions by school staff and law enforcement.”

Kennedy said he wanted to make it clear that the student was not arrested for refusing to participate in the pledge.

“Students are not required to participate in the Pledge of Allegiance,” Kennedy said.

Gary Gross, a spokesman for the Lakeland Police Department, said he could not legally comment because the case involved a minor charged with a misdemeanor.

According to a report on Bay News 9, the student allegedly told a substitute teacher that he didn't want to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, that “the flag is racist and the national anthem is offensive to black people.”

District officials said the teacher's name is Ana Alvarez. Kennedy said she was not aware of district policy regarding the pledge as voluntary.

She allegedly told the student, ""Why if it was so bad here he did not go to another place to live?""

Dhakira Talbot, the boy's mother, told Bay News 9 that the teacher's actions were inappropriate and that her son should not have been suspended.

""She was wrong. She was way out of place,"" Talbot said. ""If she felt like there was an issue with my son not standing for the flag, she should've resolved that in a way different manner than she did.""

Kennedy said he could not discuss the student's discipline. He said Alvarez will no longer serve as a substitute in Polk County Public Schools and that they will be reviewing their training policy with the outside agency that handles hiring substitute teachers.

“Our HR department will contact Kelly Services, which provides our substitutes, to further refine how our substitutes are trained,” Kennedy said.

1276,"Five months after Michael, farm workers struggle in Gadsden County","QUINCY — A single stone statue remains in the corner, a metal sink flung on the other side of the yard.

On the outskirts of Quincy, the railings that held up Mariana's mobile home are now bare. The whirlwind of remains lay between two other trailers that stand sturdy, untouched.

After sheltering at West Gadsden Middle School during Hurricane Michael, Mariana and her son returned to an obliterated home. The sight stung.

""Feo,"" she said in Spanish — ugly, bad.

""When I got back, there was nothing,"" said the 32-year-old nursery worker. She shed tears.

For Gadsden County farm workers like Mariana, already struggling under low pay, Hurricane Michael was a blow. Those close to the population say ahead of FEMA's disaster assistance deadline in December, immigrant farm workers in Gadsden County expressed fear of receiving help or even asking for it.

Five months after the near-category-5 storm, such workers in rural Big Bend communities still struggle to pick up the pieces.

Seventeen miles north, in Chattahoochee, a fish packer starts her new year under a roof partially covered by a blue tarp. Five months later, the tarp is still there.

Both sides of Luisa’s quarter-mile-long driveway remain riddled with tall downed trees, one that’s toppled over her rose bushes. On a crisp winter afternoon, the middle-aged worker replanted her flowers away from the oaks.

From the small town along the Apalachicola River, Luisa drives almost two hours to St. George Island a few days a week to pack mullet, mackerel and roe. A former migrant farm worker, this month she picked up a job cleaning plastic from a tomato field ahead of planting season.

Fall is the picking season for tomatoes. When Michael hit Oct. 10, it leveled the crops.

Luisa's husband works on a tomato-picking farm in Jackson County's Grand Ridge. This past Christmas didn’t happen for the family.

""No money, no Christmas,"" Luisa said.

But, the two-time cancer survivor is resilient.

""Sad for the damage,"" she said, ""but happy for family is OK.""

Taking a 'chance' for help

An undocumented Mexican immigrant renting her home, Luisa wasn’t eligible for FEMA housing relief help, which is limited to U.S. citizens or “qualified aliens.”

Mariana, an undocumented resident from also from Mexico, said she received help from FEMA because her son's father, a legal resident, applied on her behalf. The Tallahassee Democrat is withholding the women's names because of their fears of deportation.

Undocumented people can receive non-monetary help, like crisis counseling or disaster legal services, or monetary help if they apply on behalf of a child who is a U.S. citizen, the agency says. Mariana was unaware such help was available.

Maria Pouncey, Title I Migrant and ESOL Coordinator at PAEC, the Panhandle Area Educational Consortium, worked with churches, the Red Cross and the Gadsden County Sheriff's Office to bring help to farm workers' families after the storm.

Undocumented workers were afraid to apply for or receive help, she said — fearing their immigration status would be discovered. But even those who are legal residents were wary, Pouncey said.

""Because of all the rhetoric they've heard about taking any kind of government hand outs, even though they may very well qualify, they don't even want to take that chance,"" she said. ""And that's not even talking about those that are undocumented. That's legal permanent residents.""

Gadsden County Emergency Management set up several relief distribution sites around the county at churches, parks and community centers. One site in particular sparked concerns amid the immigrant community: A water distribution set up at the county jail, off Pat Thomas Parkway.

""The majority of the families we worked with didn't want to put their names in there for services,"" Pouncey said. ""Even though we said ... 'That's not going to affect you, this is just giving out supplies' — they were very leery.""

GCSO's Tashonda Whaley, emergency management coordinator, said her team was aware of the community's qualms and made efforts to quell them.

""We have a very close relationship with our Hispanic community. We made sure that we put it out to them that that (immigration status) was the least of our concerns,"" Whaley said, adding her team offered Spanish translation services for residents and reached out to PAEC. ""We tried to make sure that people felt safe and didn't worry about that.""

Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Tammy Spicer said officials didn't conduct any immigration operations in the area at the time. The Department of Homeland Security released a statement the day of the storm to announce ""there will be no immigration enforcement initiatives associated with evacuations or sheltering related to Michael.""

Pouncey said PAEC staff and volunteers delivered donations from distribution sites to farm workers in need, and blue tarps from FEMA were available for pick up at the PAEC center in Quincy.

""They really showed a support for all,"" she said, commending GCSO's effort to make post-storm Facebook posts bilingual. ""I have nothing but accolades.""

Over the holidays, PAEC held a social services fair and Christmas festival for the farm worker families.

The storm's strong winds blew the roof off of a Collier County migrant farmer's Gadsden County home. Pouncey and a team are working to help the farmer find a place to stay come the next harvest season. The Church World Service donated $13,000 to help her team repair 13 farm workers' trailer homes, she said.

""Everybody is still trying to get back on their feet,"" Pouncey said. ""It's not just one community, but it's all these communities that were affected.""

'Bounce back strong'

The tomato farm Luisa's husband works on was just one of many farms swept by the storm, impacting the livelihood of field workers and farm owners alike.

Big Bend and South Georgia farms sustained long-term damage — from pecan and timber to cotton and tomato crops. The storm interrupted harvest season for cotton, timber and tomato crops.

""It’s very expensive to grow crops like tomatoes, and if you have a disaster like the one this past fall it’s a big hit,"" said Shep Eubanks, Gadsden County agriculture extension director. ""There was total crop loss. We were just starting to pick tomatoes here for the fall crop when the hurricane hit. And for the most part, it leveled our tomatoes.""

Eubanks said farmers are hoping for a good crop year to recover.

""We always want a good year. But we really need one this year,"" he said. ""Hopefully we’ll bounce back — and bounce back strong and keep going.""

The storm's winds also caused damage at Gadsden nurseries, like the one where Mariana works.

""The nurseries got hit pretty hard as far as some of their shades,"" Eubanks said.

The week before the storm was a normal routine for Mariana. She’d rise at 6 a.m. to take her son Julio to school and then head to the nursery where she wears many hats, picking or packing what’s needed through the evening.

Julio turned 7 two days before Michael. She planned to celebrate with a cake. Instead, the boy and his mom were left homeless.

The pair moved in with her brother, his kids and wife. Together, they make 11 under one small trailer's roof.

Mariana said she moved to Florida from Mexico for better work opportunities.

""I had to risk my life to cross (here),"" she said in Spanish.

She may have lost her home but, she said, ""I'm still here. Thank God that we're OK.""

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) - When the gunman advanced toward the mosque, killing those in his path, Abdul Aziz didn’t hide. Instead, he picked up the first thing he could find, a credit card machine, and ran outside screaming “Come here!”

Aziz, 48, is being hailed as a hero for preventing more deaths during Friday prayers at the Linwood mosque in Christchurch after leading the gunman in a cat-and-mouse chase before scaring him into speeding away in his car.

But Aziz, whose four sons and dozens of others remained in the mosque while he faced off with the gunman, said he thinks it’s what anyone would have done.

The gunman killed 49 people after attacking two mosques in the deadliest mass shooting in New Zealand’s modern history.

The gunman is believed to have killed 41 people at the Al Noor mosque before driving about 5 kilometers (3 miles) across town and attacking the Linwood mosque, where he killed seven more people. One person died later in a hospital.

White supremacist Brenton Tarrant, 28, has been charged with one count of murder in the slayings and a judge said Saturday that it was reasonable to assume more charges would follow.

Latef Alabi, the Linwood mosque’s acting imam, said the death toll would have been far higher at the Linwood mosque if it wasn’t for Aziz.

Alabi said he heard a voice outside the mosque at about 1:55 p.m. and stopped the prayer he was leading and peeked out the window. He saw a guy in black military-style gear and a helmet holding a large gun, and assumed it was a police officer. Then he saw two bodies and heard the gunman yelling obscenities.

“I realized this is something else. This is a killer,” he said.

He yelled at the congregation of more than 80 to get down. They hesitated. A shot rang out, a window shattered and a body fell, and people began to realize it was for real.

“Then this brother came over. He went after him, and he managed to overpower him, and that’s how we were saved,” Alabi said, referring to Aziz. “Otherwise, if he managed to come into the mosque, then we would all probably be gone.”

Aziz said as he ran outside screaming, he was hoping to distract the attacker. He said the gunman ran back to his car to get another gun, and Aziz hurled the credit card machine at him.

He said he could hear his two youngest sons, aged 11 and 5, urging him to come back inside.

The gunman returned, firing. Aziz said he ran, weaving through cars parked in the driveway, which prevented the gunman from getting a clean shot. Then Aziz spotted a gun the gunman had abandoned and picked it up, pointed it and squeezed the trigger. It was empty.

He said the gunman ran back to the car for a second time, likely to grab yet another weapon.

“He gets into his car and I just got the gun and threw it on his window like an arrow and blasted his window,” he said.

The windshield shattered: “That’s why he got scared.”

He said the gunman was cursing at him, yelling that he was going to kill them all. But he drove away and Aziz said he chased the car down the street to a red light, before it made a U-turn and sped away. Online videos indicate police officers managed to force the car from the road and drag out the suspect soon after.

Originally from Kabul, Afghanistan, Aziz said he left as a refugee when he was a boy and lived for more than 25 years in Australia before moving to New Zealand a couple of years ago.

“I’ve been to a lot of countries and this is one of the beautiful ones,” he said. And, he always thought, a peaceful one as well.

Aziz said he didn’t feel fear or much of anything when facing the gunman. It was like he was on autopilot. And he believes that God, that Allah, didn’t think it was his time to die.",https://www.wfla.com/national/man-who-ran-at-mosque-gunman-probably-saved-lives/1854605238,2019-03-16T21:24:22Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1280,Nuclear rockets could open up solar system and help settle space | Glenn Harlan Reynolds,"A four-month journey to Mars? NASA is spending money on nuclear rockets again, and it's about time. They are the future of space travel and exploration.

It’s the 21st century. Shouldn’t we have nuclear rockets by now?

Actually, we had them a long time ago. In the 1960s, the United States experimented with two types of nuclear rockets. One is now in the budget again, and I think the other should be.

The first type of nuclear rocket uses a nuclear reactor to heat a reaction mass — hydrogen, or even water — and expels it from a thrust chamber as fast-moving gas. (Chemical rockets, like we use today, depend on a chemical reaction — basically, a controlled chemical explosion — to produce the hot gas.) Back during the 1960s, we experimented with nuclear rockets of this type, known as “nuclear thermal rockets,” under projects Rover and NERVA.

Generally, the problem with rocket engines is that you can either make them highly efficient but with very low thrust (like ion drives) or give them powerful thrust with low efficiency, like a chemical rocket. The only way to have both at once, high efficiency and high thrust, is to go nuclear. Nuclear thermal rockets are about twice as efficient as the best chemical rockets.

Opinion: We need to deal with space junk now

With a nuclear rocket like the ones researched in project NERVA, a trip to Mars could be done in four months. (Interestingly, the astronauts would actually be exposed to less radiation with a nuclear ship, because shortening the trip reduces their exposure to cosmic rays in space.) And with higher thrust and higher efficiency, nuclear rockets would open up much of the solar system. They could even be designed to rendezvous with comets and use cometary ice as fuel for the return trip.

Nuclear rockets could return again

Now NASA is getting interested in nuclear rockets again. In 2017, it awarded a nearly $19 million contract for development. And this year’s NASA budget contains $100 million for nuclear thermal research, leading to a demonstration in 2024.

As Mark Whittington writes in The Hill, “Nuclear propulsion technology will mean the difference between a deep-space exploration program consisting of sorties that land on Mars and visit other destinations, do a lot of good science, then return, and one that expands human civilization throughout the solar system.”

But I mentioned that there are two kinds of nuclear rockets. Nuclear thermal propulsion is great, but if you want real performance, you have to go with another kind of nuclear propulsion: Orion. Not the boring space capsule of the same name being developed today, but the project of the 1960s that involved eminent physicist Freeman Dyson and famed nuclear weapons designer Ted Taylor. Orion was a spaceship powered by (small) nuclear explosions. Specialized bomblets would go off below a big pusher plate, shoving the spacecraft (hard!) in the other direction.

Orion worked better when it was big and could in theory have attained a fraction of the speed of light, and certainly would have been fast enough to go anywhere in the solar system in a reasonable time. (The Orion team’s motto was “Saturn by 1970.”) All of this is recounted in George Dyson’s fascinating book, Project Orion: The True Story of the Atomic Spaceship.

Will Bezos get his wish to visit outer planets?

The Orion never flew (though a model powered by high explosives called the “Hot Rod” did), but maybe it’s time. Some might argue that nuclear explosives would violate the Outer Space Treaty’s provision forbidding “nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction” in orbit, but nuclear explosives aren’t necessarily nuclear weapons. (Asked the difference between the Atlas rockets that launched astronauts into space and the Atlas missiles aimed at Moscow, President John F. Kennedy reportedly gave a one-word answer: “Attitude.”)

The Limited Test Ban Treaty prohibits nuclear explosions in outer space, but among space major powers only the United States and Russia are parties; France and China, for example, are not. And there’s an argument that this treaty doesn’t effectively ban nuclear explosions used for space propulsion.

Well, we’re making progress on the first type of nuclear rocket, and for the moment I guess I’ll just have to be content with that. But when I looked at the page for Dyson’s book on Amazon, I found a review by an influential reader, one Jeff Bezos. Wrote Bezos: “For those of us who dream of visiting the outer planets, seeing Saturn's rings up close without intermediation of telescopes or charge-coupled devices, well, we pretty much *have* to read ‘Project Orion.’ In 1958, some of the world's smartest people, including famous physicist Freeman Dyson (the author's father), expected to visit the outer planets in ‘Orion,’ a nuclear-bomb propelled ship big enough and powerful enough to seat its passengers in lazy-boy recliners. They expected to start their grand tour by 1970. This was not pie-in-the-sky optimism; they had strong technical reasons for believing they could do it.”

Like Bezos, I loved the book, and I’d like to see Orion happen. If only there were a really rich guy with a strong interest in space settlement who felt the same way ...

1282,No charges to be filed against Martin County bus aide in 'Make America Great Again' hat controversy,"CLOSE The bus aide told deputies ""I was personally offended,"" and ""I totally regret doing this."" VIDEO CONTRIBUTED BY MARTIN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE

MARTIN COUNTY — Prosecutors said they will not charge a Martin County schools bus aide for removing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat from a student's head last week.

“The reports and video were reviewed,"" Assistant State Attorney Nita Denton said Friday. ""While the bus aide's behavior is inappropriate and unprofessional, it doesn’t raise to the criminal level.""

On March 7, deputies for the Martin County Sheriff's Office said they got a call from the boy's mother, Jacquelyn Putt. She said her son, Gunnar Johansson, 14, got onto the bus on March 5 and an aide grabbed his blue hat — which had ""Trump"" in large capital letters across the front — off his head.

Deputies said Gunnar attends Hidden Oaks Middle School, and students were allowed to wear a hat to school if they made a donation to March of Dimes.

The bus aide who took the hat told deputies she asked the teen to take off his ""MAGA"" hat multiple times and he refused.

She told deputies she then gently removed it from his head and asked him to put it in his backpack because she didn't know students were allowed to wear a hat that day.

The woman wrote in a statement to the Sheriff's Office she regrets what happened.

1284,No charges to be filed against Martin bus aide in MAGA hat controversy,"CLOSE The bus aide told deputies ""I was personally offended,"" and ""I totally regret doing this."" VIDEO CONTRIBUTED BY MARTIN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE

MARTIN COUNTY — Prosecutors said they will not charge a Martin County schools bus aide for removing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat from a student's head last week.

“The reports and video were reviewed,"" Assistant State Attorney Nita Denton said Friday. ""While the bus aide's behavior is inappropriate and unprofessional, it doesn’t raise to the criminal level.""

On March 7, deputies for the Martin County Sheriff's Office said they got a call from the boy's mother, Jacquelyn Putt. She said her son, Gunnar Johansson, 14, got onto the bus on March 5 and an aide grabbed his blue hat — which had ""Trump"" in large capital letters across the front — off his head.

Deputies said Johansson attends Hidden Oaks Middle School, and students were allowed to wear a hat to school if they made a donation to March of Dimes.

The bus aide who took Johansson's hat told deputies she asked the 14-year-old to take off his ""MAGA"" hat multiple times and he refused.

She told deputies she then gently removed it from his head and asked him to put it in his backpack because she didn't know students were allowed to wear a hat that day.

The woman wrote in a statement to the Sheriff's Office she regrets what happened.

""I do not have a problem with Gunnar,"" she wrote. ""We have always gotten along. I am sorry for what i did, and I hope he forgives me. I overreacted.""

The Martin County School District said it also was looking into the incident. No information was immediately available Friday if a decision had been made about the aide's conduct.

This story will be updated.

BRANDON — Authorities say a man accidentally ran over his 3-year-old son in the parking lot of a Florida Waffle House.

The Tampa Bay Times reports the parents of Jeremiah Rios each mistakenly thought the other had put the child in their SUV as they left the restaurant in Brandon on Tuesday night.

Hillsborough County Sheriff's officials say 29-year-old Guillermo Junior Montoya Rios had started to drive away when the right front tire struck the boy, who suffered severe head injuries. The child was taken to Brandon Regional Hospital, where he died.

The sheriff's office says neither drugs nor alcohol were a factor in the accident.

Less than 24 hours after winning the race for West Palm Beach mayor, Keith James said he can’t wait to get started.“I was the one candidate that really felt bullish on West Palm Beach and felt that we should maintain our momentum,” James said in a one-on-one interview with WPBF 25 News.James said he has three top priorities.One is adding more affordable housing in the city.Another is reducing violent crime by encouraging police officers to be more involved.“Rather than driving through some of these neighborhoods with the windows up, air conditioning on, they need to get out of the cars and interact with the community,” James said.James’ third priority is curing the city’s homelessness problem.He said he wants to remain compassionate but not just to the homeless.“We need to respect the rights of the private businesspeople and folks who just want to enjoy some of our public spaces, and so we’ll have an enforcement element,” James said.On another note, James also said he does not underestimate the significance of his victory.While there have been other African-Americans to serve as mayor of West Palm Beach, they were all elected to the City Council and then appointed as mayor in what was mostly a ceremonial position.James is the first African-American to be elected to the office of mayor of West Palm Beach.“I hope it inspires young people, African-American young people, little boy or little girl, to say, ‘You know what?

1289,Fla. mulls clemency for FBI informant,"TALLAHASSEE — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Clemency Board are considering early prison release for a man known as ""White Boy Rick,"" once one of the FBI's youngest informants and the subject of a recent Hollywood movie.

The board on Wednesday heard the case of Richard Wershe Jr., 49, who's imprisoned in Florida for his role in a large interstate car theft ring operated while he was already in prison. At age 14, Wershe was an FBI informant in Detroit who helped convict a major cocaine trafficking ring but eventually got caught selling drugs himself.

His story was the basis of the 2018 film ""White Boy Rick"" starred Matthew McConaughey, with Richie Merritt in the title role.

At the hearing, two retired FBI agents told the board Wershe deserves early release because of all he did for the government, including assistance on several public corruption cases while behind bars. His current release date is Oct. 26, 2020, from the Putnam Correctional Institution in Florida.

The board did not immediately issue a decision, although its staff recommended early release.

""I believe a great injustice to Richard Wershe has been done by the government,"" said ex-agent Herman Groman, who said Wershe infiltrated a violent Detroit drug gang and helped prosecutors convict 20 people in the 1980s. ""He has never been recognized because of this.""

Added former agent Gregg Schwartz: ""He has never lied to me about anything. I fully recommend for clemency. He's contributed greatly to law enforcement.""

DeSantis, a Republican chairing his first clemency hearing since taking office, appeared to express skepticism. The governor noted that Wershe got involved in a car theft ring involving some 150 stolen vehicles while behind bars serving his drug sentence.

""He had been helping you guys and then turned around and engaged in additional criminal conduct,"" DeSantis said.

""You need to look at the totality of everything he has done over 32 years,"" Schwartz replied.

Attorney General Ashley Moody, a former judge and prosecutor, told the agents it ""speaks volumes"" that they showed up for Wershe but did not indicate if she supports early prison release.

DeSantis told reporters before the board meeting that he has an open mind on all clemency cases.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190313/fla-mulls-clemency-for-fbi-informant?rssfeed=true,2019-03-13T17:05:54Z,The Ledger,Couple,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815

Edmund Normand, the family's attorney, said Roberta Perez and her son, Tiago, were visiting from Brazil when the incident happened in late January.

Normand said Tiago's left foot got stuck between the ride's vehicle and the cement offloading area, breaking multiple bones in his toes, foot and leg.

1299,"Florida student arrested after refusing to stand for Pledge of Allegiance, reports say","LAKELAND, Fla. - An 11-year-old in Florida refused to recite the pledge of allegiance and ended up getting arrested over it, a report said. His mother is now demanding the charges be dropped.

A sixth grader at Lawton Chiles Middle Academy was arrested and taken to a juvenile detention center, charged with disrupting a school function and resisting arrest without violence.

It's a decision that's not sitting well with the student's mother, Dhakira Talbot, who says her son is in gifted classes and has been bullied at the school before.

""I'm upset, I'm angry, I'm hurt,"" Talbot said. ""Moreso for my son. my son has never been through anything like this, and I feel they should've handled this differently.""

The February 4th incident started when a substitute teacher asked the 11-year-old boy to stand up for the pledge.

He reportedly told the substitute teacher the flag was racist and the national anthem was offensive to black people.

In a statement to the district, the substitute teacher reported telling the 11-year-old boy why if it was so bad here he did not go to another place to live.

He said he then said, ""they brought me here."" and she said she told him, 'well you can always go back,' because she was from Cuba and the day she felt unwelcome here, she'd find somewhere else to live.

""She was wrong... She was way out of place,"" Talbot said.

The substitute teacher then wrote she called the office because she quote 'didn't want to continue dealing with him.'

According to the arrest affidavit, the student was arrested because he refused to follow multiple commands, repeatedly called school leaders racist and was disruptive.

They said he threatened to get the school resource officer and principal fired and to beat the teacher, an accusation he says is just not true.

""I want the charges dropped and I want the school to be held accountable and the officer for what happened. Because it shouldn't have been handled the way it was handled,"" Talbot said.

A spokeswoman with the school district said students aren't required to participate in the pledge of allegiance, but the substitute teacher wasn't aware of this.

The spokeswoman said the substitute teacher will no longer be able to work at any of the district's schools and the district is still looking into the matter.

1300,Jupiter father: 'Cheap car wash will end up costing me thousands',"A Jupiter father says he was taken for a ride after a costly car wash.

What was supposed to be a cheap car wash will end up costing him thousands.

“A $12 car wash cost me $3,800,” said Braiden Smith, a manager at a local phone store.

Smith, a father of a 3-year-old boy, said he took his Nissan Altima through a 7-Eleven automatic car wash machine, along East Indiantown Road.

A service he said he’s used dozens of times.

CBS12 News can’t verify the damages weren’t there before.

However, Smith claims his car was fine, but it came out with deep scratches after the car wash. He went straight to the owners of the franchise.

“I didn’t see any signage at the car wash that said that they weren’t liable. They put me in contact their claims department,” he said.

Smith said that in a conversation that he had with the co-owner, he was told to submit a claim with Broadspire Global TPA, a Texas–based insurance company, that handles all the claims for 7-Eleven.

He shared screenshots of the conversation with CBS12 News.

“I told them [Broadspire] that they [7-Eleven] caused damage to my vehicle. I sent them the photos. I took my car to get appraised,” Smith said. “Afterwards, that’s when they called me back. They said, ‘hey your claim is denied’.”

CBS12 News reached out to the owners of the franchise by phone and texts.

They did not respond to our request for comment.

The couple who owns the franchise along Indiantown Road were not at the business when CBS12 News stopped by Friday afternoon.

“They offered the service. I paid for a car wash. I was a paying customer. I just simply want them to make it right,” Smith said.

Smith said the car wash service was closed for repairs and provided photos that shows someone working on the machines. It reopened for business late this afternoon.

“It seems really suspicious to me to say that there is nothing with the car wash, but then you have somebody repairing two weeks later,” he said.

The 25-year-old father is sharing his story because what he said happened to him could happen anywhere.

The social media post has since received hundreds of comments and over a dozen shares.

“If I don’t get resolution from 7-Eleven, I’m going to be filing suit in the Palm Beach County Courthouse,” Smith said.

1302,Earth keeper and educator John Kiseda's passion for the planet lives on,"John Kiseda uses rain-barrel water and ""worm tea"" made from composted newspapers to irrigate and feed the native plants he gives to friends. John Kiseda waters some plants with rain water he collects in a rain barrel (Photo: The News-Press archives)

He meant it as the title of a brochure – not a summary of his life’s work – but John Kiseda nailed both when he called San Carlos Bay Bunche Beach Preserve “as green as it gets.”

Family, friends and colleagues are still coming to grips with Kiseda’s December 2018 death, and will gather to share hugs and memories March 20 at Lee County’s Manatee Park, which he helped create. For nearly a quarter of a century, Kiseda, 66, worked for the county’s Department of Parks and Recreation, making his ecological vision reality, until he retired in 2014 as sustainability and education program coordinator.

An unparalleled force for environmental education in Florida and the wider world, Kiseda’s passion lives on throughout the county, in the wild places he loved to share. That sharing was always done with fastidious integrity, which was sacred to Kiseda, a founder of the nonprofit Society for Ethical Ecotourism.

Southwest Florida is full of initiatives he helped champion: fertilizer laws, increased recycling and accessible green spaces. He used his soft-spoken charm and laser focus to enlighten everyone ranging from kindergarteners to condo associations to major developers about the wisdom of environmental stewardship.

Kiseda grew up in Detroit. ""He was a city boy – not countrified in any way,"" said Larry Decker. ""I think he got the bug in school when he decided he wanted to study outdoor education.""

The two, who were a couple for 26 years, wed in 2015, as soon as same-sex marriage was legal. ""He wanted to get it done before someone changed their minds ... we thought that they would take the right away from us again.""

An earth keeper in the truest sense of the phrase, Kiseda was famous for walking the talk – from watering his seedling native plants with home-brewed earthworm tea to eschewing animal products.

""He was a vegetarian for 47 years,"" Decker said. ""He loved animals to the point that he wouldn't eat them. And he wouldn't even wear a leather belt or carry a leather wallet or wear leather shoes. He was all in.""

Kiseda's passion was as infectious as his laugh.

""It was never just a little bit with him. Once he got behind something, he was 100 percent,"" Decker said. ""He wanted to make everything better ... he touched a lot of lives.""

, and he reveled in planet-focused get-togethers, which he hosted over the decades. There was usually music, a speaker and food, and those who attended came away nourished in body and soul.

Potlatch is the term the indigenous people of this continent’s northwest coast use for such gift-giving feasts, but it could just as easily characterize Kiseda’s lifelong efforts.

Here’s some of what those who knew him had to say about the gifts John Kiseda gave other people and the planet:

All the vegetation in the yard of John Kiseda's Fort Myers home is extremely tolerant or thrives in wet conditions. (rainy season) (Photo: The News-Press archives)

“John came to Lee County just when we needed someone to make us all more aware of the importance of our unique and vibrant environment in Southwest Florida and how to protect it and walk lightly on the Earth … He always presented programs that he created with excitement and fun. It made you fall in love with whatever subject John was teaching.

“I had the pleasure of not only having the excitement of working with a wonderfully passionate man, but he was also a gracious, fun and giving friend … John made me a better person because he shared his talents and his high goals which made me work a bit harder and more diligently than I would have without him.

“ ‘A Time Gone By’ was an idea of John’s of creating a historic timeline for the Lee County coast. The timeline included the Calusa, the Spanish, European settlers and Punta Rassa starting in 1521 with Ponce De Leon bringing cattle to the famous port and ending in 1982 with the Summerlin-Towels Home being destroyed by wind. This program was presented to the public and volunteers over the years and explained how many of our parks were named. For me this project was one of the best times I had with John. He got me so excited learning about our local area. We would visit libraries and talk to local people and see sites where this history took place. You could not help but catch his thrill and enthusiasm in finding out what the next discovery may be. John is an enthusiast of planet Earth that will greatly miss his passion and knowledge.”

""We were co-workers for over 20 years ... A true educator, he created the interpretive docent training programs that still exist (in Manatee Park and Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve). All those docent volunteers who now are 'Friends' do great work creating authentic and educational experiences for our visitors, of course fulfilling his goal of outdoor interactive classrooms.

""John was instrumental in the development of Florida Society for Ethical Ecotourism as one of its founding members 20 years ago. He led a talented team who developed the first certification program for eco-tour operators in Florida. As a lifelong environmental educator, he traveled the state sharing our mission and generating awareness of the principles of Ecotourism. We are very proud of what FL SEE has become and are so very appreciative to John's passion and leadership as he truly was the driving force behind it. We will continue to work hard on achieving the FL SEE mission in John's memory.""

Two women were killed and three other people, including a child, were badly injured in a three-vehicle crash on County Road 484 Wednesday night.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers did not immediately release the names, pending notification of family members. The crash occurred west of Marion Oaks Pass.

Troopers on scene said a man was driving a Cadillac sport utility vehicle east on CR 484 when he rear-ended another SUV. Speed appeared to be a factor in the crash.

In the second vehicle were a man, who was driving, and two women. After impact, the driver of the second SUV lost control and entered the westbound lane, where the vehicle struck a car head-on.

In the car, officials found a child in a front seat. There was a car seat in the back, but troopers said it did not appear the boy had been restrained in it. He was taken by helicopter to UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville in critical condition.

A bystander performed CPR on the female driver. But after firefighters arrived, she was pronounced dead at the scene. One of the female passengers in the second SUV also died.

Marion County Fire Rescue spokesman James Lucas said they received the call at 9:47 p.m. and arrived seven minutes later.

Firefighters had to extricate people in the second SUV.

The male driver was taken to Ocala Regional Medical Center in critical condition, Lucas said. Both passengers were also taken to ORMC. One was in serious condition. The other was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Bailey Chase for years has played the character that viewers often dislike.

The Naples native and father of three says he's enjoying his new roles, including the new Netflix Original movie ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" that premiered earlier this month.

Chase, 46, gained prominence for his acting from 2012 to 2017 on the Western crime series ""Longmire,"" in which he played the role of an ambitious Wyoming sheriff's deputy, Branch Connally.

“More than anything, the arc that I got to do on 'Longmire,' that character Branch, he hit all the notes,"" Chase said in a recent telephone interview.

""It gave me a confidence as an actor that I could do anything, I could play good. I could play bad. And by portraying these newer characters, that’s how I connect with the audience more. Then they start rooting for you.”

In his latest role, based on a true story, Chase plays Cory Snyder, the father of Amberley Snyder, a successful rodeo barrel racer who returns to the sport after a car crash.

In real life, Bailey and his wife, Amy, have three children: twin 2-year-olds (a boy and a girl) and a 4-year-old daughter who was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Chase was still shooting ""Longmire.""

“For me as a dad, to play that role, as an actor, you go to those places where I’m imagining my girl in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair,"" Bailey said.

“Since 'Longmire' and becoming a dad, I feel like I can play anything.”

Born in Chicago, he grew up in Naples, living in the seaside town from age 4 through his freshman year at Naples High School. He transferred to the Bolles School in Jacksonville, where he played football and baseball and graduated from the private school before heading to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

After graduating from Duke with a bachelor's degree in sports psychology, Chase said, he decided to fulfill ""a boyhood dream"" and headed to Los Angeles instead of New York.

""I came out here, being a Florida boy,"" Chase said. ""The climate was a little bit better. I was living at the beach, waiting tables and going to acting class.”

He eventually traveled overseas to become a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, to study Shakespeare.

When he returned to the U.S., he landed a role on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" a television series that ran from 1997 to 2003. For the next few years, Chase portrayed Chris Robert Hughes on the soap opera ""As The World Turns.""

He co-starred as ""Becks"" Scott in the ABC comedy-drama ""Ugly Betty,"" which ran from 2006 to 2010, and on the TNT series ""Saving Grace"" that ran between 2007 and 2010.

But his most notable role came in 2012, on ""Longmire,"" which began on the A&E channel and, later, Netflix. Robert Taylor starred as Walt Longmire, a stoic, rugged, no-nonsense sheriff; the actor revealed his Australian accent away from the camera, Chase said.

""He’s a good dude,"" Chase said of Taylor. ""It was a strong cast. We were all distinctly different.”

Longmire"" also co-starred Katee Sackhoff, Lou Diamond Phillips and Gerald McRaney, known for his TV roles on ""Major Dad"" and ""Simon & Simon"" that Chase said he grew up watching.

Upcoming work for Chase includes a role this summer on season 4 of ""Queen of the South,"" a crime drama on the USA Network. Chase said he's been flying to New Orleans for filming and returning home to LA every weekend.

All he said he could reveal about his character is that he's ""a jazz musician with a dark past.""

Chase said he still has family in Florida, including a brother who's a builder based in Ocala. He hasn't been in Naples for more than a decade but hopes to visit again one day.

“Growing up down there, I couldn’t wait to get out,"" he said of Naples.

""But once I got into my 20s and my 30s, I always enjoyed coming back home. Naples will always be home. It's so humid; it just has a feel and a smell. It’s very nostalgic for me.”

The heat wave that's gripped Southwest Florida for the past several weeks will continue into the weekend, and meteorologists say the chances of seeing significantly cooler weather in our region are slim between now and next winter.

""It's the changing seasons basically,"" said Nicole Carlisle, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Ruskin, which covers the Fort Myers area. ""We're headed out of winter, so this is the time of year when cold fronts just stop making it all the way through. Weather systems stay further to the north and all that energy and rain and cold air stays to the north.""

Friday's high in Fort Myers is expected to be 86 degrees, according to NWS records, with Naples topping out at 87 degrees both Friday and Saturday.

That's several degrees above the average temperature of 80 degrees for any March 15 on record, according to NWS.

""It's not in the forecast for now, but early-to-mid next week we could be looking at highs at the lower to mid-70s and that's several degrees lower than average,"" Carlisle said. ""But getting 'cold' cold is less likely as the days go on.""

The forecast is similar in Naples, which is covered by the NWS office in Miami.

""The high pressure is to the north of us and that will lead to breezy eastern and northeastern winds, and typically the Gulf breezes aren't allowed to form and it gets a little warmer in cities along the coast,"" explained NWS meteorologist Arlena Moses. ""As we go into the weekend we will have another front come through and this one looks like it's going to bring better rain chances for us as we head into the weekend and into next week.""

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is calling for above-average chances of above-average temperatures and rainfall between now and May.

This dry season hasn't been particularly dry as the Southwest Florida region is about 2.3 inches above average for rainfall since the wet season ended at the end of October.

And although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been conducting pulse releases from Lake Okeechobee, the surface of the lake is about 12.5 feet above sea level.

That's typically as low as the Army Corps wants to see the lake get, but the Corps has decided this year to let the lake drop as low as 11 feet or lower.

Both Lee and Collier score in the 300 to 399 range, which is about in the middle of a scale that ranges from 0 for super saturated conditions and 750 for really dry times.

El Nino conditions are impacting the weather as well.

""We're in a weak El Nino and we have been most of the winter,"" Moses said. ""And that is forecast to continue through the spring.""

El Nino conditions tend to bring wetter, slightly cooler winters while also suppressing the development of tropical storms and hurricanes.

Will this El Nino impact the upcoming hurricane season?

""It's too early for that determination,"" Moses said. ""That will become a little (clearer) in the forecasts as we get into the next two months.""

1324,Florida woman charged in 3-year-old son's 1986 Nevada death,"Amy Elizabeth Fleming, 60, of Dania has been arrested on a murder charge in Francillon Pierre's death.

LAS VEGAS — A woman who moved to Florida from the Las Vegas area a year after her 3-year-old mysteriously vanished more than 30 years ago has been arrested on a warrant charging her with killing the boy, authorities said Monday.

Amy Elizabeth Fleming of Dania, Florida, was being transferred to Nevada from jail in Palm Beach County following her Jan. 29 arrest on a murder charge in Francillon Pierre's death in August 1986.

The child has not been found, but North Las Vegas police Officer Eric Leavitt said investigators recently obtained new witness accounts saying Fleming killed him. Leavitt declined to specify how authorities believe the child died.

Fleming, who was 28 at the time and is now 60, and her then-fiance Lee Luster told police that the boy, nicknamed Yo-Yo, wandered away from them at a Saturday afternoon swap meet.

""The parents have always been persons of interest in the case,"" Leavitt said. ""At this point, evidence points to (Fleming), but the investigation is ongoing.""

Luster, now 62, has not been charged with a crime.

Investigators questioned Fleming and Luster after the boy was reported missing, and Leavitt said they told police that Pierre's father, who lived in Haiti, may have abducted the boy.

Leavitt said the father was cleared as a suspect in 1986. Police are now trying to locate him in Haiti, the North Las Vegas police spokesman added.

1328,Can you choose the most depressing Disney movie scene?,"Whether it's the animated shorts or full-length motion pictures, Walt Disney Studios is a master of creating magic and wonder for children and adults alike.

That magic allows us to escape the harsh reality we may find ourselves in and instead live the fantasy we’ve always dreamed of. But as great as Disney is at making us feel warm and fuzzy inside, those movies and shows are also pretty effective when it comes to destroying our feelings of happiness -- and instead, filling us with sadness. We all remember the opening sequence of ""UP.""

Walt Disney once said:

""For every laugh, there should be a tear.""

Well, if you're like us, you've shed many tears while watching your favorite Disney flicks. Get your tissues handy as we go over our saddest Disney scenes and figure out which one is indeed the most depressing.

'Lion King'

© Walt Disney Studios

We’re starting off our list with the soon-to-be live action motion picture, ""The Lion King."" Of course, you already know what scene we’re talking about. We're introduced to Mufasa right away and we immediately find ourselves getting attached to this fatherly figure. His demeanor as a father -- being a stern dad and wanting what's best for his son -- is very relatable to most kids. Mufasa's brother Scar has different plans for the king and devises a plan to dethrone him. Spoiler alert: Mufasa attempts to save Simba during a wildebeest stampede and -- well, you know what happens next. But we can’t be too sad. It’s the circle of life.

""Dad? ... Dad, come on. You gotta get up.

Dad. We gotta go home.""

'Dumbo'

© Walt Disney Studios

Next is the Disney classic, ""Dumbo."" While the entire movie is a tearjerker, we’re going to look at a scene that cuts real deep. Dumbo and the other elephants are parading around the big ring when a little boy tugs at Dumbo's ears. Upset at the way her son is being treated, Mrs. Jumbo protects her son, resulting in her being locked up, away from the other elephants. Dumbo goes to visit her one night and she tries to comfort him from behind her steel bars. This movie shows just how far a mother will go to protect those she loves. We can only imagine how sad this scene will be in the live-action version, set to be released in May. If the scene alone doesn’t get to you, the song surely will.

'Inside Out'

© Walt Disney Studios

Who's your friend that loves to play? We’ve all had imaginary friends at one point. They kept us company when we were alone and gave us someone to play with when no one else would. But in a harsh reality, we all have to grow up some time. Eventually, those fond memories disappear and we forget how to be a child. This scene from ""Inside Out"" shows us the final moments of 11-year-old Riley’s imaginary friend, Bing Bong. During his adventure with Joy and Sadness, Joy and Bing Bong fall into the memory pit, where things are forgotten. As Bing Bong starts to fade, we're reminded of our childhoods and the things we let fade away. This scene pulls at our heart strings because it's just so relatable.

""Go save Riley! Take her to the moon for me. OK?""

'Hunchback of Notre Dame'

© Walt Disney Studios

This movie could be one of Disney's darkest productions. Quasimodo sits in his bell tower gazing at the people below. He wants nothing more than to experience one day out there, among the people he's watched, but he's told that he is deformed and ugly. He's convinced he's a monster and will never fit in. This scene takes place during a street party where rules don't apply. Quasimodo swings down from his tower to join in the Festival of Fools, where he is crowned king of the fools. For once, Quasimodo feels as if he fits in. As everyone cheers, he breaks into a big smile, but those dreams are shattered fast when the guards begin pelting Quasimodo with tomatoes and eggs, eventually turning the entire crowd against him. Quasimodo is a gentle character who wants nothing more than to fit in and experience a life outside his tower.

'Toy Story 3'

© Walt Disney Studios

If you were born in the early ‘90s, you probably grew up with the ""Toy Story"" films.

The films convinced us that our toys were living a life of their own while we were away. We saw Woody save Buzz from being blown away on a rocket. We remember the scene in which Buzz finally flew, or fell with style into the family car. As we got older, we were able to see our favorite toys in a sequel. This time, they would meet new friends and escape being sent to a museum with the rest of the Roundup Gang. All of us who grew up with the movies were young adults when Disney and Pixar graced us with a third film. This would prove to be the saddest of the ""Toy Story"" collection. We all had to say goodbye to our childhood toys at one point, whether they were thrown away or donated, it was as if we lost a piece of ourselves. ""Toy Story 3"" gave everyone a chance to say goodbye to the toys they grew up loving. Now with a fourth movie set to be released this year, a new generation of kids can enjoy the toys that defined childhood for many of us.

""Now, Woody -- he’s been my pal as long as I can remember. He’s brave, like a cowboy should be. And kind and smart. But the thing that makes Woody special? Is he’ll never give up on you -- ever. He’ll be there for you, no matter what. Y’think you can take care of him for me?""

'Monsters Inc.'

© Walt Disney Studios

Disney and Pixar showed us that if there are monsters in our room, chances are, they aren't as scary as we may think. According to the movie, they may be more scared of us, and if you get into trouble, make sure to bring plenty of socks -- 2319! After the adventures and struggles Mike and Sully go through in order to get Boo home, they finally have to say goodbye to her. Knowing that the door will be destroyed after they leave, Sully has a hard time saying goodbye as Boo continues to pick up her toys to try and play. Sully knows his time with her is running out and decides to tuck her into bed. At a young age, kids don't really understand goodbyes and what they mean. This makes the scene even harder to watch because Boo expects to be able to open the door and find Sully once he has left, which we know won't happen. Luckily, true friends come through in the end and we know this goodbye is short-lived.

""Boo? Kitty!""

Phew, you made it. Hopefully, you aren't feeling too depressed after thinking about those scenes. All that's left to do is cast your vote below for which one you believe is the saddest. Your vote matters, so choose carefully.

We know there are a ton of other moments in Disney movie history that have brought on the waterworks; we didn't even bring up ""Bambi!"" If you have another scene you believe is the saddest, let us know in the comments below.

1330,Para fired following hoodie incident,"The Franklin County School Board has terminated the employment of a paraprofessional who was accused in December of child abuse for allegedly tugging forcefully on a third grader’s hoodie.

By a 4-1 vote, with Pam Marshall opposed, the school board voted at its Feb. 28 regular meeting to fire Abbie Gail Shiver, 45, of Eastpoint, following her suspension without pay in the wake of the Dec. 4 incident in the Franklin County Schools cafeteria.

Shiver was charged on Dec. 6 with child abuse without great bodily harm, a third-degree felony. One week later, her Tallahassee attorneys Steven Dobson III and Cody Short filed a plea of not guilty and requested a jury trial in the courtroom of Circuit Judge Charles Dodson. Shiver’s next court appearance is slated for Tuesday afternoon, April 9.

At last month’s school board meeting, Marshall spoke out against the firing, which had been recommended by Superintendent Traci Moses. She noted that neither Shiver nor her attorneys were present at the school board meeting, and that notification of the proposed firing had not been signed for by Shiver or her attorneys.

Moses said she was advised by her attorney to send the notice by both regular and certified mail, as well as by FedEx, to the address on file in Shiver’s personnel file. She said the deliveries had been refused.

“We sent it four ways,” said Allison Chipman, a staffer in the human resources department. “We were asked to send it directly to her attorney and that’s where it was sent.”

Marshall continued to press the matter. “I’d like to see proof she was notified correctly,” she said. “Why aren’t they here to represent her?”

School Board Attorney Barbara Sanders said that not appearing at the school board member may have been deliberate.

“Maybe they’re making a strategic decision,” she said. “They make their decisions, they have their rationale I can only assume.’

Sanders said the school board’s decision to terminate would not be a final action, since Shiver could request a hearing before the Florida Department of Administrative Hearings for an administrative law judge to decide the merits of the dismissal.

“There’s more process after tonight. She will be requesting a DOAH hearing if the issue is that there wasn’t sufficient notice,” Sanders said.

“We already suspended her without pay, why not wait? This is somebody’s livelihood we’re deciding on,” said Marshall.

“You can’t leave her in suspension without pay forever,” said Sanders.

During the discussion of the motion to fire, made by George Thompson and seconded by Stacy Kirvin after he relinquished the gavel, Marshall raised questions about the validity of the evidence against Shiver.

“(This is based on) statements of four third-grade students,” she said. “Why did one staff member not notice what was going on?”

Thompson reminded his colleague that board members had to have just cause if they chose to overrule a superintendent’s recommendation.

“I don't personally feel like she’s guilty,” replied Marshall. “That’s my just cause.”

According to the probable cause affidavit that led to the filing of a criminal charge, School Resource Officer Brock Johnson said he was told Dec. 4 about the incident, which took place in the cafeteria the previous day.

The boy told law enforcement Shiver asked him to take off his hoodie, but he had not. “That is when Shiver pulled it off his head and choked him with it,” claimed the boy in the report.

The report said the incident was witnessed by another school employee, who said when she noticed Shiver taking the hoodie off, “(the boy) was trying to pull away from her, but she (the witness) couldn’t determine if he was being choked or not.

“(The employee) says that after what she thought was around one minute, that Shiver let go of (the boy’s) hoodie and helped him take it off,” read the report.

The employee told law enforcement she noticed red marks around the boy’s neck after Shiver walked away, marks that were also observed by the culinary arts teacher as well as by Shelley Miedona, the assistant principal, according to the affidavit.

Moses said students often wear hoodies to school during cold weather, which is allowed, but that school policy treats the hoods on these garments like any other hat, which cannot be worn inside of the buildings.

After Johnson, and Capt. Gary Martina, reviewed video of the incident, a warrant for Shiver’s arrest on the felony charge was issued. She turned herself in and was released on $1,000 bond.

Initially hired by the school district as a substitute in Sept. 2005, Shiver became a paraprofessional in Feb. 2015. To qualify for hiring as a para, there is no course requirement, but individuals must pass an up to three-hour exam.",https://www.apalachtimes.com/news/20190313/para-fired-following-hoodie-incident?rssfeed=true,2019-03-13T13:43:45Z,The Times,Couple,"129 Commerce St, Apalachicola, FL 32320, USA",FL,32320

A Colorado teen who pleaded guilty to killing a 10-year-old girl has been sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 40 years.Aidan Zellmer was sentenced Monday in the June 2017 beating death of Kiaya Campbell of Thornton, who was the daughter of his mother’s boyfriend. Zellmer was 15 at the time and was charged as an adult. He pleaded guilty to first-degree murder after deliberation on Feb. 1, and prosecutors agreed to drop a charge of first-degree murder of a child. The Dever Post reports Campbell was first reported missing on June 7, 2017. Zellmer initially told police the two were going to steal Pokemon cards after he damaged some of hers. After they failed to steal the cards, he said, he lost Campbell as the two walked home through a storm. “Aidan was told his story did not make sense and he kept telling us that is what happened,” an arrest document stated. Campbell's body was found the next day. When he was told about her body being discovered, Zellmer cried and said he didn't hurt Campbell but left her behind on the walk home because she was being annoying. However, evidence collection and an autopsy linked the murder to Zellmer. The teen told officers he used a metal object to beat Campbell. KDVR reports an affidavit identified the murder weapon as a pipe. He has never provided a motive for his actions. District Attorney Dave Young called it the most violent act he has seen a 15-year-old commit. He dismissed Zellmer's defense, which centered around the boy's mental health issues, troubled family history and alleged abuse.“Fifteen-year-olds make bad decisions but they don’t commit cruel, heinous crimes like this,” Young said, according to the Denver Channel. “After striking her five times in the head with a metal pipe, he left her in a field. When he talked to police, he was calm, cool and collected. He misled and deceived police who were looking for her. This is a rare case. Thank God we don’t have other 15-year-olds doing what he did.""Family members spoke about Campbell's smile, her spirit and goofiness. Her mother, Chantel Campbell, said she keeps a video of her daughter dancing and singing ""everywhere"" so she can watch it when she misses her most.

Named Beeper, the emu was born at the park during the first week of March. According to Danielle Lucas, Gatorland's Animal Care Director, Beeper weighs 391 grams and is expected to grow very quickly. He should be fully grown in just six months.

“We are thrilled to have our very first baby emu born here at Gatorland. We will know in a few weeks when we do bloodwork if our baby is a boy or girl,” said Lucas.

Beeper will begin to be in public view in the park in just a couple weeks, Gatorland reported. Adult emus can already be seen in the area of the park closest to Pearl's Restaurant.

Gatorland reportedly acquired seven emus in 2008. This is the first time that they have had eggs and a baby hatch, though.

1338,"Netflix, 'Longmire' star Bailey Chase talks growing up in Naples, career","Actor and Naples native Bailey Chase co-stars in a new Netflix Original movie, ""Walk Ride Rodeo."" (Photo: Photo courtesy of Greg Peters)

Bailey Chase for years has played the character viewers often dislike.

The Naples native and father of three says he's enjoying his new roles including the new Netflix Original ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" that premiered earlier this month.

Chase, 46, gained prominence for his acting from 2012 to 2017 on the western crime series ""Longmire,"" in which he played the role of an ambitious Wyoming sheriff's deputy, Branch Connally.

“More than anything, the arc that I got to do on 'Longmire,' that character Branch, he hit all the notes,"" Chase said in a recent telephone interview.

""It gave me a confidence as an actor that I could do anything, I could play good. I could play bad. And by portraying these newer characters, that’s how I connect with the audience more. Then they start rooting for you.”

In his latest role, Chase plays Cory Snyder, the real-life father of Amberley Snyder, a successful rodeo barrel racer who returns to the sport after a car crash.

Bailey and his wife Amy have three children: twin 2-year-olds (a boy and a girl) and a 4-year-old daughter who was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Chase was still shooting ""Longmire.""

“For me as a dad, to play that role, as an actor, you go to those places where I’m imagining my girl in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair,"" Bailey said.

“Since 'Longmire' and becoming a dad, I feel like I can play anything.”

Happy Mother’s Day to all the amazing Mama’s out there (miss you Mom) and to my beautiful wife for these 3 little backseat drivers ❤️🚌 pic.twitter.com/dln0pQr4cT — Bailey Chase (@Bailey_Chase) May 13, 2018

He grew up in Naples, living in the seaside town from age 4 through his freshman year at Naples High School. He transferred to the Bolles School in Jacksonville where he played football and baseball and graduated from the private school before heading to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

After graduating from Duke with a bachelor's degree in sports psychology, Chase said, he decided to fulfill ""a boyhood dream"" and headed to Los Angeles instead of New York.

""I came out here, being a Florida boy,"" Chase said. ""The climate was a little bit better. I was living at the beach, waiting tables and going to acting class.”

He eventually traveled overseas to become a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), to study Shakespeare.

When he returned to the U.S., he landed a role on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" a television series that ran from 1997 to 2003. For the next few years, Chase portrayed Chris Robert Hughes on the soap opera ""As The World Turns.""

He co-starred as ""Becks"" Scott in the ABC comedy-drama ""Ugly Betty,"" which ran from 2006 to 2010, and on the TNT series ""Saving Grace"" that was ran between 2007 and 2010.

But his most notable role came in 2012, when he began on ""Longmire"" that began on the A&E channel and, later, Netflix. Actor Robert Taylor starred as Walt Longmire, a stoic, rugged, no-nonsense sheriff who revealed his Australian accent away from the camera, Chase said.

""He’s a good dude,"" Chase said of Taylor. ""It was a strong cast. We were all distinctly different.”

Longmire"" also co-starred actress Kate Sackhoff and actors Lou Diamond Phillips and Gerald McRaney, known for his TV roles on ""Major Dad"" and ""Simon & Simon"" that Chase said he grew up watching.

Upcoming work for Chase include a role this summer on season 4 of ""Queen of the South,"" a crime drama on the USA Network. Chase said he's been flying to New Orleans for filming and returning home to LA every weekend.

All he said he could reveal about his character is that he's ""a jazz musician with a dark past.""

Chase said he still has family in Florida, including a brother who's a builder based in Ocala. He hasn't been in Naples for more than a decade but hopes to visit again one day.

“Growing up down there, I couldn’t wait to get out,"" he said of Naples.

""But once I got into my 20s and my 30s, I always enjoyed coming back home. Naples will always be home. It's so humid; it just has a feel and a smell. It’s very nostalgic for me.”

HOUSTON (AP) - Police say a fight over a brownie has left a 14-year-old Houston boy dead of a stab wound to the eye and another 14-year-old boy on the run from authorities.

Houston Independent School District police say the boy died Friday of the knife wound suffered Wednesday afternoon.

District Police Chief Paul Cordova said the fight erupted after school Wednesday outside a convenience store across from the Jane Long Academy in southwest Houston. He said that when the victim was loaded into an ambulance, he still acted as if the fight were continuing.

No identities have been released, but Cordova says investigators have spoken with the suspect's family.

1343,2-year-old mauled to death by family dogs,"The boy’s grandmother also suffered traumatic injuries while fighting to get the dogs off the boy, according to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office.

A toddler was killed by two dogs and his grandmother was severely injured while trying to save the boy, who was left in the yard with the dogs Friday morning north of High Springs.

The mauling is the latest in a series of attacks by dogs on people and other animals, but the first recently to occur on the property of the dog owner.

“It was a bad scene,” said Alachua County Sheriff’s Lt. Brett Rhodenizer. “This ties into the greater conversation (of maulings) but this one today is a family tragedy. This was not dogs running amok through a neighborhood. This was dogs in their home with their extended family. And it happened within the confines of their private property.”

Six dogs, including the two that mauled the boy, were taken from the home by Alachua County Animal Services.

The mauling occurred about 10:30 a.m. at 20915 NW 210th Ave., a mobile home down a dirt road off 210th Avenue. The sheriff’s office has not released the names of those involved.

The grandmother’s daughter lives in the home. The child was the son of a second daughter.

The grandmother and the boy had gone to the house to tend to the dogs while the daughter was at work, something the grandmother often does.

Two canines that had lived in the home for a while were let out in the yard. The boy went out to play while the grandmother stayed inside to make a sandwich.

“When she returned outside, there were no dogs and no boy,” Rhodenizer said. “She hears the sound from an outbuilding behind the residence. She goes back there and finds the two dogs actively mauling the 2-year-old. She fights them off with a shovel and sustains injuries herself.”

The woman suffered injuries to her neck. Rhodenizer said her wounds were severe but not life-threatening.

She and the boy were the only people at the home at the time but she managed to call 911 for help, which arrived within minutes.

Emergency responders tried to revive the boy but he died in the house as a result of the attack. The woman was taken to the hospital for treatment.

Members of the Alachua County Crisis Team have responded to assist the family. Family members at the home where the attack occurred and an adjacent home did not want to talk.

“There’s a whole family out here grieving,” one woman said.

Alachua County Animal Services was notified of the attack quickly and responded to the home, Director Ed Williams said. The owner surrendered the two dogs that attacked. They will be held for 10 days under quarantine and then euthanized.

The other four dogs were taken into custody while the investigation is underway.

“The owner told us she had adopted all the dogs from rescue,” Williams said. “All the dogs looked healthy and in good body condition, and were kept in clean crates. They were all sterilized as best I could tell and were current with their vaccines.”

One of the dogs that attacked was described by Williams as an American Staffordshire terrier — a name often used for a pit bull — and the other a lab mix.

The other dogs included to be what appeared to a boxer-pit mix, various mixed breeds and a large dogo Argentino that weighed more than 100 pounds.

Williams said he and county officials are trying to come up with ideas for programs or educational efforts to try to prevent the incidents that have been happening lately, along with the less severe instances of dog bites.

“We typically handle a lot more dog bite cases than people think we do,” Williams said. “We’ve been brainstorming about what — if anything — we can do to address this.”",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190309/2-year-old-mauled-to-death-by-family-dogs?rssfeed=true,2019-03-09T06:10:08Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

1345,How Jackie Robinson is still being honored in Central Florida,"ORLANDO, Fla. - America's pastime has been around for more than 170 years.

It's a sport that's given us iconic athletes. While Americans celebrate Black History Month, Jackie Robinson, one of the all-time greatest players, is being remembered in Central Florida.

It was 73 years ago that Jackie made his spring training debut with the MLB, which marked a historical day for the nation.

[RELATED: 100 years after his birth, Jackie Robinson's impact still being felt | The history of Black History Month]

On March 17, 1946, Robinson stepped on to the Daytona Beach ball field, making Daytona Beach the first city in the South to allow integrated baseball during a time when segregation laws were strictly enforced.

""They proved here in Daytona Beach that blacks and whites could peacefully watch integrated baseball, which was historic at the time,"" said Bill Schumann, a Jackie Robinson Ball Park historian and founder of the Jackie Robinson statue committee.

In 1946, cities like Deland, Sanford and Jacksonville prohibited Robinson to play in their ball parks.

Schumann said the Daytona Beach City Commission ignored laws of segregation and, with support from the founder of Bethune Cookman College, Robinson made his spring training debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers -- a day on which both blacks and whites cheered him on.

""This was a milestone in sports and civil rights history, so Daytona Beach stood alone, and it was a political decision. Technically, it was against the law for any type of integration in the South, and what is unique about this is this happened without a federal court order,"" Schumann said.

Schumann said it was a historical moment that paved the way for other teams to open up to integrated baseball.

""It was demonstrated here at city island for the first time in the history of modern professional baseball that integrated baseball was a box office attraction. It made money,"" Schumann said.

The ball park, located off Orange Avenue, has several images of Robinson, including a statue of him giving a baseball to a child.

""The theme of this statue is Jackie Robinson passing on his contribution to future generations. Jackie Robinson is pigeon-toed -- just like he was in real life -- in the statue,"" Schumann said about the statue that stands right at the entrance of the ball park.

Jackie was a one-of-a-kind athlete adored by thousands.

""There were so many things that were amazing and were heroic about Jackie Robinson. Number one: his mental game. He could concentrate when he needed to, and he was a tremendous natural athlete,"" Schumann said.

Around the stadium, fans will also see what some may consider one of the most impactful images: a picture showing black baseball fans segregated from the rest of the stands.

Today, a replica of that area from where they had to watch the game stands in the same place -- only now, it serves as a picnic area with tables and benches.

George Bates was a bat boy. He met the iconic player when he was 12 years old. A video from the National Baseball Hall of Fame from March 17, 1946, shows Bates handing Jackie a bat.

""It was amazing to start with -- that I was gonna get to be that boy for the team I follow. I remember him as quiet, not saying nothing to nobody and just went about his business. I knew the controversy was going on and all, but it was real peaceful. It really was,"" Bates recalled about the emotions from that day.

Schumann said the story teaches valuable lessons in more ways than one.

""This story is not just about baseball. This is a story about civil rights. It's a story about how people, fans accepted integrated baseball,"" Schumann said.

In honor of that monumental day, Daytona Beach renamed the baseball field Jackie Robinson Ballpark and created the Jackie Robinson Museum within its gates.

1347,Florida woman arrested for killing son who disappeared in 1986,"By: Ken Ritter | Associated Press

February 11, 2019

NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) — A 60-year-old woman who moved to Florida from the Las Vegas area a year after her 3-year-old mysteriously vanished more than 30 years ago has been arrested on a warrant charging her with killing the boy, authorities said Monday.

Amy Elizabeth Fleming of Dania, Florida, was being transferred to Nevada from jail in Palm Beach County following her Jan. 29 arrest in Boca Raton on a murder charge in Francillon Pierre's death in August 1986.

The child has not been found, but North Las Vegas police Officer Eric Leavitt said investigators recently obtained new witness accounts saying Fleming killed him. Leavitt declined to specify how authorities believe the child died.

Fleming, who was 28 at the time, and her then-fiance, Lee Luster, told police that the boy, nicknamed Yo-Yo, wandered away from them at a Saturday afternoon swap meet.

""The parents have always been persons of interest in the case,"" Leavitt said. ""At this point, evidence points to (Fleming), but the investigation is ongoing.""

Luster has not been charged with a crime.

Investigators questioned Fleming and Luster after the boy was reported missing, and Leavitt said they told police that Pierre's father, who lived in Haiti, may have abducted the boy.

Leavitt said the father was cleared as a suspect in 1986. Police are now trying to locate the father, the North Las Vegas police spokesman added.

Fleming and Luster married and moved to South Florida in 1987, Leavitt said.

The boy was officially considered a missing person, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children featured him in 2011 in an age-progressed portrait showing what he might look like at age 29.",https://www.wctv.tv/content/news/Florida-woman-arrested-for-killing-son-who-disappeared-in-1986-505697871.html,2019-02-11T20:39:00Z,WCTV,Couple,"1801 Plantation Cir, Tallahassee, FL 32309, USA",FL,32309

1356,"Selma Blair sheds light on multiple sclerosis, but here's what you don't know","It is estimated that multiple sclerosis affects more than 2.3 million people worldwide, according to the National MS Society, and naturally, celebrities are not immune — ANYONE can develop the disease.

Selma Blair, best known for her roles in ""Cruel Intentions,"" ""The Sweetest Thing"" and ""Hellboy,"" has been in the news recently after discovering she has multiple sclerosis, following years of symptoms that went misdiagnosed.

She’s not the first celebrity to help raise awareness about the disease. Others who have been diagnosed and revealed their diagnosis to the world include:

Jack Osbourne , the son of heavy metal rocker Ozzy Osbourne.

, TV personality, actor and radio talk show host. He is best known for hosting the daytime talk show ""The Montel Williams Show."" Ann Romney, wife of Sen. Mitt Romney.

Each of these people has had a unique story to tell when it comes to the disease and its effects.

Blair, a well-known actress and mother of a 7-year-old boy, is the most recent to tell her brave story.

“My neurologist said, ‘This will bring a lot of awareness because no one has the energy to talk when they’re in a flare-up,'” she said.

Because MS causes damage to the central nervous system — made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves — almost any function can be affected. Symptoms are unpredictable and can be vastly different in type and severity from one person to another. They can include but are not limited to: vision disturbances, loss of balance, numbness, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, overwhelming fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis, blindness and much more.

Anyone who has seen Blair on the red carpet or in interviews has likely witnessed the glitzy cane she's sporting or the significant quiver in her voice -- both of which were brought on by MS.

Blair has been vocal about the fact that she suffered from her MS symptoms for years before finally getting her diagnosis.

“(I’m happy) being able to just put out what being in the middle of an aggressive form of multiple sclerosis is like,” Blair said.

We’re talking years of suffering. That seems surprising, doesn’t it? But it’s actually very common.

MS can be incredibly difficult to diagnose, and it is one of many illnesses that can affect the central nervous system, so ruling out other conditions is necessary.

Some of those conditions include:

Brain tumors.

Genetic disorders.

Deficiencies.

Inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system.

Infections of the central nervous system.

Damage to the brain or spinal cord.

Other non-MS demyelinating disorders.

Each of the above conditions is just the parent of other problems to sort through.

“I had tears. They weren’t tears of panic. They were tears of knowing I now had to give in to a body that had loss of control, and there was some relief in that,” Blair said of learning of her diagnosis. “Ever since my son was born, I was in an MS flare-up and didn’t know. I was giving it everything to make it seem normal.”

There is no single lab test yet that can detect or rule out MS, but an MRI is the best help doctors have in reaching a definitive diagnosis.

They then must determine which type of MS the patient has: primary progressive, secondary progressive, relapse-remitting and clinically isolated syndrome. Yet there’s still no way of knowing how each person’s disease will progress.

The cause of MS is still unknown, and there is currently no cure.

There are, however, medications that have proven to delay progression of disability to some degree by reducing the number of relapses, and different types of therapies and technological advances are helping to manage symptoms.

While an MS diagnosis used to mean a much shorter life expectancy, the time frame for those suffering from MS has increased by quite a lot, with treatment breakthroughs, improved health care and lifestyle changes. Recent research indicates, however, that people with MS may live an average of about seven years less than others due to complications or other medical conditions, according to the National MS Society.

“We never know what kills us, but this is not the doctor telling me I’m dying,” Blair said.

1357,Trevena says domestic violence arrest won't impact upcoming 'Stand Your Ground' trial,"Trevena says domestic violence arrest won't impact upcoming 'Stand Your Ground' trial Video Video

PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - Prominent attorney John Trevena was released from jail Tuesday afternoon, following his arrest on domestic violence charges Monday.

Trevena, who represents Michael Drejka in the controversial ""Stand Your Ground"" case, claims he's the victim.

He was taken into custody at a woman's home in Largo.

Trevena said the woman and her boyfriend stole three rugs from a previous home they used to share. He claims he went to the home to retrieve them.

""The idea that I am the victim in the case and I end up in jail, she's got a whole apartment full of heroin and they don't even do anything to either one of them and just let them walk away,"" Trevena said outside the jail.

The woman claims Trevena hit her. He said it's not true.

""Check her background, she's been arrested seven times. I don't have any prior arrests. I've never been accused of anything like this,"" said Trevena.

He claims Largo police didn't want to hear his story.

""They stole my stuff and we're gonna believe them, that's the Largo police idea of an investigation so people out there in the public, Largo PD come to your door, slam it shut,"" he said.

""It just comes to show that when you've sued a police department as many times as I have in the past, they get pay back and boy they got some pay back on me. I spent the last 18 hours incarcerated over nothing.""

He said his arrest will not impact Drejka's case, who will soon stand trial for the controversial shooting of Markeis McGlockton last year.

""Arrest don't mean anything, convictions is what counts,"" he said.

""I've got the best record in the county for defense and I put that against anyone. Compare me with any defense lawyer in this county.""

Other attorneys representing Drejka have been arrested.

Lysa Clifton withdrew from the case after she alleged solicited Drejka in jail.

It was the result of a Florida bar investigation.

A month later, she was arrested on DUI charges in Tampa.

Trevena said new comer William Flores has also been arrested but wouldn't elaborate.

In January, lead detective in the Markeis McGlockton shooting, George Moffett Junior, was arrested and fired from the sheriff's office after he showed up to a crime scene under the influence.

Trevena slammed the fired detective in a previous interview, saying his report on Drejka couldn't be trusted.

He said there's a difference between his arrest and detective's.

""He's in a different capacity when he's investigating a crime, if he's appearing at a scene intoxicated, nobody said I was intoxicated, look at the reports, it says, 'no influence of drugs, no influence of alcohol,'"" he said.

Trevena said he predicts the domestic violence charges against him will be dropped.

The woman in the report did not want to comment.

1358,Volusia pool builder accused of failing to finish jobs,"EDGEWATER, Fla. - The Volusia County Sheriff's Office has launched a fraud investigation into a local pool builder after several customers have complained about the contractor taking their money without finishing their pools.

James ""Jimmy"" Griffin, 40, is the president of Aquatic Daze Custom Pools and Spas, a Port Orange-based business that has been in operation since 2007, state records show.

Griffin, who holds an active state certification as a pool contractor, has been accused of failing to complete several pool construction projects after doing only minimal on-site work.

A News 6 reporter stopped by Griffin's home seeking comment for this story. When Griffin approached the reporter on the street, he denied being the contractor and drove away in his truck without discussing his pool business.

Griffin also did not respond to a message left with his parents, who live at a home in Port Orange that Griffin uses as his company's mailing address.

""We saved and budgeted money to finally get our dream pool. It was supposed to be a Christmas pool,"" Mary Kay Steflik said. ""We signed the contract in August. And nothing was happening. He kept having excuses.""

Steflik said she and her husband paid Griffin $21,000 but claims he only moved a buried cable, relocated some concrete footers and assisted another worker with laying rebar.

""He didn't even dig a hole or anything,"" Steflik said. ""He probably only came over four or five times total and would work for maybe an hour to two hours. And the whole time he was texting on his phone.""

Steflik said Griffin stopped visiting their home and responding to their phone calls in December.

Another customer, James Rothholz, said he last heard from Griffin in November, after paying the contractor more than $30,000 to build a backyard pool.

""I consider myself a pretty good judge of character, but, boy I blew it on this one,"" said Rothholz, who signed a contract with Aquatic Daze Pools in July.

According to Rothholz, Griffin dug the hole for the pool, installed rebar and hired a subcontractor to spray concrete gunite.

Rothholz claims the pool contractor vanished before plumbing installation was to begin.

""He said, 'I'll be back tomorrow. I'm going to work all day.' But we never saw him,"" Rothholz said. ""I kept leaving text messages, and he stopped responding.""

The gunite subcontractor placed a lien on Rothholz's property after claiming Griffin failed to pay him more than $5,500 for the job.

Rothholz later hired a different pool contractor to finish the swimming pool.

""We had to pay for this thing twice,"" he said. ""A $35,000 job has turned into almost $70,000.""

Rothholz has filed a complaint with Florida's Department of Business and Professional Regulation, hoping the state licensing agency will suspend or revoke Griffin's certification.

He and Steflik have also filed complaints with law enforcement agencies.

Griffin is currently facing criminal charges in an unrelated matter.

In December, Volusia County sheriff's deputies arrested Griffin and two other men after investigators said the agency's helicopter captured video of them using grinders and paint to conceal the vehicle identification numbers on three stolen utility trailers.

Griffin has pleaded not guilty to charges of grand theft, evidence tampering and possession of vehicles with altered VINs.

At least two customers of Griffin's pool business have filed lawsuits in Volusia County court, claiming the contractor failed to finish their jobs.

""We thought we could trust him,"" Steflik said. ""We saw some of the work he did, and we were just fooled, like so many other people.""

1362,Greyhound station closes in FWB (PHOTOS),"FORT WALTON BEACH — It's a ghostly sight at the Greyhound bus station on Perry Avenue.

For more than four decades passengers packed the terminal while traveling to and from Fort Walton Beach. Only a small can of pepper spray, an old Greyhound sign and a 100-year-old safe were left behind in the empty, dusty building Tuesday.

The pay phone outside can still dial out if you have 50 cents to spare. Not one customer was there to use it, though. Nor were there buses to pick up anyone.

Vince Bruner, who has owned the building for 20 years, said that's because the era of Greyhound bus stations has ended.

""Greyhound has been working deals with different gas stations where they can rent for free,"" Bruner said Tuesday. ""Jimmy Ready, who owned Jimmy's Pawn Shop, owned it for 20 years before me, I think. I was a little disappointed when I found out (the station was closing), but it is part of the changing economy.""

A sign on the building says the bus pickup and drop-off has moved to the Shell gas station at 401 Miracle Strip Parkway. Over at Shell, nearly a dozen passengers waited for a bus headed for Orlando.

Carolyn Peterson, manager of the convenience store, said the owners made a deal with Greyhound to allow a make-shift terminal in the parking lot. Shell, according to Peterson, hoped to benefit from the passengers wanting snacks and services. She also said Greyhound plans to operate out of gas station parking lots nationwide.

The new pick-up location began March 1. The bus station on Perry Avenue closed Feb. 28.

Some longtime residents are sorry to see the station close.

Martha Garvie, owner of the Aunt Martha's Bed & Breakfast, said she remembers the Greyhound station when it first opened as a Trailways station in 1958. She was just 17.

She'd watch as passengers boarded the station, which Garvie said looks nearly the same today.

""I'm sad,"" Garvie said. ""The station is a part of history. There's not many things like that left. People didn't have the luxury of cars in those days, so people caught the bus to visit their relatives. I don't think it would have survived this long if people weren't still using it. But I guess that's why it closed, isn't it?""

Bruner said since opening in the 1950s, the station has bounced several times between the ownership of two competitors — Greyhound and Trailways. Greyhound took the building back over in the early 2000s, he said.

Tom Rice, owner of Magnolia Grill, said as a 9-year-old boy he would board the Trailways bus with his older brother to visit family in Ohio. He remembers that the buses in the '50s definitely weren't air conditioned and that they smelled of disinfectant.

As a teen, he would rush to the bus station before it closed to pick up ice cream delivered from New Orleans to Perri's Italian Restaurant where he worked.

Rice also said he was emotional when he passed the bus station and saw a ""For Rent"" sign in the lawn.

""Another familiar landmark that has ceased to function in its old way,"" Rice said. ""I think it would make a neat little restaurant.""

Greyhound did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Bruner said he's unsure of the future of the building.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190312/greyhound-station-closes-in-fwb-photos?rssfeed=true,2019-03-12T15:18:23Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) - The manhunt for a suspected teenage gunman is over. Police say 17-year-old James Griffin has turned himself in.

Just before 12:30 Sunday morning, gunshots rang out along Gregg Court in Sarasota.

A 17-year-old boy was killed and detectives immediately started searching for a suspect, 17-year-old James Griffin.

Officials still have not said a motive, but many who live in the neighborhood are now in fear.

""These cats, these dudes, these kids, they're too young! What is really going on?!"" said one resident.

""You haven’t even really lived your life and you get shot and killed... People have kids. This don’t make no sense to me.”

After much media coverage, authorities say Griffin turned himself in Monday afternoon at the Juvenile Assessment Center in Manatee County.

""We were concerned very early on in this investigation because this individual did have a firearm and he was on the streets of our community. We're just thankful that he decided to do the right thing and turn himself in. And now we can all rest a little easier and continue our investigation.,” said Sarasota Police spokeswoman Genevieve Judge.

Authorities are now interviewing Griffin to figure out exactly what happened.

He's facing a charge of aggravated manslaughter of a child.",http://www.wfla.com/news/sarasota-county/sarasota-pd-armed-and-dangerous-teen-turns-himself-in/1840764259,2019-03-11T23:26:56Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

1365,Jacksonville boy honored for saving his mother's life after shooting,"<p>A now 6-year-old boy is credited for saving his mother's life -- and for the first time, the young mother and son are talking about a day that changed their lives forever.</p><p>Last August, Saman ""Sam"" Khaleel was 5 when he witnessed his mother, 25-year-old Farah Al Gburi, get shot. Sam ran to a neighbor, a stranger's home, which turned into a life-saving decision.</p>
 The shooting 
<p>On the morning of Aug. 14, 2018, Farah was walking Sam to school on Jacksonville's Southside. Police say <a href=""https://www.news4jax.com/news/jacksonville-man-charged-with-attempted-murder-in-partners-shooting"" target=""_blank"">36-year-old Dheyaa Mohammed shot Farah in the chest and took off</a>.</p><p>Sam saw it all. The five-year-old went to a nearby apartment, and the couple living there dialed 911.</p> <strong>UNCUT: <a href=""https://www.news4jax.com/enterprise/911-call-recording-after-jacksonville-mother-was-shot"">Call to 911</a></strong></p><p>""There's a little boy that came to our apartment,"" the caller told the dispatcher. ""He says that the father shot the mother and the mother's dead and she's laying out in the parking lot.""</p><p>The couple later turned the phone over to Sam.</p> <strong>Dispatcher:</strong>  Hello?<br />
<strong>Sam:</strong>  Um... my dad, um... My Mommy died.<br />
<strong>Dispatcher:</strong>  OK, listen to me OK? We got police and rescue comin' to help your mommy, ok? <br />
<strong>Sam:</strong> Ok.</p><p>As Sam talked with the 911 dispatcher, he was not only able to tell her what happened to his mother, he was also able to describe his father, what his father was wearing and the car he was driving.</p> <strong>Sam:</strong> Um... um... my, my daddy shoot her in a gun.<br />
<strong>Dispatcher:</strong> Where did he shoot her at?<br />
<strong>Sam:</strong> Um, right there in the neck. <br />
<strong>Dispatcher:</strong> In The neck?<br />
<strong>Sam:</strong> Yes.<br />
  <br />
<strong>Dispatcher:</strong> What, what color shirt and pants did he have on?<br />
<strong>Sam:</strong> Um... black. <br />
<strong>Dispatcher:</strong> A Black shirt?<br />
<strong>Sam: </strong>Uh-huh. <br />
<strong>Dispatcher:</strong> Did he leave with the gun? Did he leave with it?<br />
<strong>Sam:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong>Dispatcher: </strong>Ok. <br />
<strong>Sam:</strong> Yes. And he try, he try shoot his self.  </p><p>It was a distress call to Jacksonville police that sent officers and rescue crews racing to The Kings Crossing Apartments on Old Kings Road South. Rescuers reached Farah in time to save her life.</p><p></p><p>""I will never forget (Sam's) eyes when he was looking at me,"" the mother from Iraq explained. ""I just told him at that moment, 'Just come let me hug you!' He said, 'No, mom.' He just go (to get help) and just did it for me. It's like a miracle for me.""</p>

 Lives changed forever 
<p>Farah is now paralyzed from the waist down. After the shooting, she spent the next several months in the hospital and then into rehabilitation -- while her son was temporarily placed in foster care.</p><p>""All the time I was thinking, 'Where Sam?'"" Farah said. ""He doing good? He sleeping good? Because me and Sam we always together. We doing everything together.""</p><p>Before the shooting, she remembers the job she had as a food scanner, which kept her on her feet constantly -- often 10 hours a day. She's now learning how to live with what she calls her ""new body.""</p><p>""It's like a baby when the baby's born,"" Farah explained, comparing her experience to when a baby discovers for the first time that they can make their hand or head move at will. ""I'm trying just to (make my mind) accept that but it's so hard for me."" </p><p>But Farah and Sam have each other, and after we spent time with them, it's obvious how close they are.</p><p></p><p>When we asked Sam why he loved his mom so much, he answered directly, ""Because she's my friend."" </p><p>Farah says Sam not only watches her every move, he's also very in tune with her mood.</p><p>""When he feels I'm sad, he come and play with me,"" she said smiling as she recalled one particular pep talk Sam gave her. ""'Mom, I'm here! Why are you sad? Don't be sad, mom. Laugh. Laugh, mom.'"" </p><p>She says Sam motivates her to mask the constant and lingering nerve pain she describes feeling around the clock.</p><p>""My injury was here in my lungs,"" she said, pointing to the side of her chest. ""I can't breathe good.  When I sneeze, it just hurts.""</p><p>""I'm trying to do it for Sam,"" she said with determination in her eyes and voice, ""because if Sam sees (that I need help) to reach (something), he will not be strong. I have to (be) strong. 'See me Sam, I'm strong!' He will be strong too.""</p><p>The kindergartner already has plans on becoming a hero full-time.</p><p>""He want to be officer!"" Farah exclaimed. ""He always telling me, 'Mom, I wanna be officer!' and I say, 'OK, you will!""</p><p>Farah says she can easily see it becoming a reality, especially after she watched Sam get sworn in as a Junior Officer last month by Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams in recognition of the bravery and calm Sam displayed while helping his mom the day she was shot.</p><p></p><p>Sam didn't want to talk to us much about being a hero, but he was eager to tell us about someday becoming an officer.</p><p>""I put the bad guy in the jail,"" he explained about what his job would be as a police officer. ""You can't shoot the bad guy, you only put him in the jail.""</p>

 The shooting suspect 
<p>It was Sam's description of his own father to the 911 dispatcher that helped arriving officers recognize and arrest him.</p><p>Police say Dheyaa Mohammed drove away within seconds of shooting his estranged wife, but eventually returned to the shooting scene. That's when he was arrested.</p><p></p><p>News4Jax cameras were there as Mohammed was placed in handcuffs, crying to police, ""I killed my wife!""</p><p>Mohammed has been charged with attempted murder. During a court appearance last week, he asked to judge to assign him a public defender.</p><p></p><p>If found guilty, he faces 25 years to life in prison.</p><p>Farah says the three of them came to the U.S. in 2016 after Mohammed served as a translator for the U.S. military in Iraq. When the U.S. military presence in Iraq was scaled back, Farah says Mohammed and others helping American troops during the war were offered a chance to live in the U.S. with their families to shield them from retaliation.</p><p>Farah says she and Mohammed eventually separated, with Farah and Sam moving out and living in a different apartment complex.</p>

 Difficult journey ahead 
<p>After the shooting, and after Mohammed's arrest, he was evicted from his apartment. The problem is, Farah's name was still on Mohammed's lease. Now her credit history has taken a hit.</p><p>She is now looking to find a local, income-based apartment complex that will accept her. For now, she relies on Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) to pay for her basic needs. She and Sam are living in temporary housing and are eager to find a place they can settle into and call home.</p><p>Because Farah is paralyzed from the waist down, she's also hoping someone can show her where to find the help she needs to secure a vehicle outfitted for her type of disability, as well as a service dog.</p><p>Farah says she realizes the road ahead of her will be full of challenges, but she feels comfort because she knows Sam is right by her side.</p><p>""He tries to make me stay alive!"" Farah exclaimed. ""That way I have to fight for him.""</p>",https://www.news4jax.com/news/jacksonville-boy-honored-for-saving-his-mother-s-life-after-shooting,2019-03-11T20:47:36Z,WJXT,Couple,"4 Broadcast Pl, Jacksonville, FL 32207, USA",FL,32207

1367,JSO: 2 shot in drug-related robbery at 103rd Street apartment complex,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Two young men, possibly teenagers, were shot during a drug-related robbery Sunday afternoon on the city's Westside, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.

It happened about 2 p.m. at an apartment complex on 103rd Street at Monroe Smith Road.

According to the police report, a man went to the complex to meet with a woman who contacted him about buying some THC gummies. Police said he walked past three young men and got into a car with the woman to make the deal and that's when two of the young men approached, one with a gun in hand, and demanded everything he had. The man with the gummies pushed the gun away, and was shot in the leg, police said. He managed to shoot back, according to the incident report.

Later on, according to police, one of the robbers showed up at an area hospital with a gunshot wound to the chest.

The Sheriff's Office said it recovered the gummies.

Both shooting victims were listed in stable condition at last check. Sgt. Jaime Eason described the victims as being younger in age, but he was not certain whether they were teenagers.

A neighbor told News4Jax a boy seen walking away from the scene after the gunfire appeared to flag down a passing vehicle.

""He looked like he was signaling for help,"" the neighbor recalled. ""When they stopped and got out, he collapsed on the ground.""

Jacksonville has been a deadly city for teenagers over the past year. On Dec. 18, 2018, we brought you a story about 13 cases of teenage homicides in 2018.

Anyone with information about this case is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 904-630-0500 or Crime Stoppers at 1-866-845-TIPS (8477).

GRANGER, Ind. (AP) - Investigators say an 11-year-old northern Indiana boy shot and wounded his state-trooper father because he was upset that his parents took away his video games.

The South Bend Tribune and WSBT-TV report that investigators say in court records that the boy used his father’s service weapon to shoot him once in the buttocks last month. They say the boy got the gun from the trooper’s locked police vehicle outside their home in Granger, near South Bend.

St. Joseph County prosecutors have filed a petition alleging delinquency for attempted murder, which is the juvenile equivalent of a criminal charge.

The trooper, who was off-duty when he was shot, was hospitalized afterward and his condition has improved since then. The Associated Press isn’t naming him to avoid identifying his son.

1375,In the Know: Locale Eatery launches in North Naples,"CLOSE The new local café for breakfast and lunch replaced Sweet Caroline’s next to NCH North Naples Hospital where Goodlette-Frank ends at Immokalee Road. Tim Aten, tim.aten@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4857

Last week’s launch of Locale Eatery in North Naples was a celebration of sorts. The restaurant opened March 5 on Chef-owner Terrence Burney’s 31st birthday.

The new local café for breakfast, brunch and lunch replaced Sweet Caroline’s, which closed Dec. 28 after operating for more than two decades in a commercial strip next to NCH North Naples Hospital campus where Goodlette-Frank Road ends at Immokalee Road.

The newly remodeled restaurant has had a receptive response in its first week, Burney said. “It turned out well,” he said.

Menus for the new eatery have a variety of scratch dishes such as breakfast sandwiches, hot and cold lunch sandwiches, burgers and create-your-own salad options. The menu offers some culinary surprises in the form of a Belgian waffle topped with crispy duck confit, blueberry compote and a side of spicy maple syrup; grilled cheese with braised short rib, smoked cheddar, grilled onions and a side of au jus; and Lobster Mac N Cheese made with a four-cheese blend.

“My personal favorites are the Lobster Mac N Cheese and the Crab Sammie for lunch,” Burney said. “For breakfast, the duck and waffles — a little something different — and the tater tots, the homemade tater tots.”

Lunch specialties range from the Quinoa Power Bowl ($9.99) to the Lobster Mac N Cheese ($14.99). The Crab Sammie ($14.49) with shoestring fries features a jumbo lump crab cake served on a brioche bun with lettuce, tomato and lemon parsley aioli. Other options include Fish N Chips, Locale Shrimp Roll and Locale Eatery Fried Hen Sandwich.

In addition to a classic double cheeseburger ($11.29) served on a sesame challah bun with shoestring fries, Locale Eatery offers two other burgers. The Frenchie ($11.99) features two 4-ounce house-blended patties with Gruyere cheese and a red wine and grilled onion reduction. Donnie Boy ($13.99) has three patties with grilled jalapeno peppers and mushrooms, smoked cheddar and sundried tomato bacon aioli.

The lunch menu also includes sandwiches served with house-made potato chips. Cold sandwiches range from $7.49 for egg salad to $9.49 for corned beef. Hot sandwiches ($9.99-$10.99) feature the aforementioned grilled cheese, a Philly cheesesteak with steak or chicken, a grilled Reuben and the ultimate BLT, made with cherry wood smoked bacon, leaf lettuce, fried green tomatoes and roasted garlic herb aioli served on sourdough bread.

The Greens section of the lunch menu has three salad options ($10.99-$11.49) and a create-your-own salad with a choice of greens, protein, toppings and dressings. Lunch sides ($2.99-$5.29) include fruit and pasta salads, cole slaw, macaroni and cheese, heirloom tomatoes and chips, fries and tots.

Breakfast delicacies include avocado toast ($7.49), Benedicts ($8.99-$11.99), a bagel and lox plate ($12.99), shrimp and grits ($12.99) and pancakes ($4.49 for two or $5.99 for three). The Eatery French Toast ($10.99) is made with house-made pound cake, lemon curd and berries. I’m All Shook Up ($7.49), an item that would surely rock Elvis, features peanut butter, banana and bacon served open-faced on a choice of bagel. Locale Toast ($10.99) has smashed avocado, roasted cherry tomatoes and ricotta cheese topped with arugula salad.

The breakfast menu also has many “From the Hen” egg options ($4.99-$10.99) such as scrambles, skillets and frittatas; as well as “Healthy Picks” ($4.49-$8.49) such as steel-cut oats with maple syrup sugar, a fruit bowl, a parfait and a chilled grapefruit with ginger, sugar and mint.

Following Sweet Caroline’s tradition, expect fresh baked goods such as cinnamon rolls, muffins, cookies, cupcakes, bagels, biscuits, croissants and bread. Some of the baked goods are displayed in a case near the counter.

Locale Eatery also serves wine, wine-based cocktails, and craft and domestic beers.

Chef Burney moved to the Naples area slightly less than a year ago but he grew up in Sanibel.

“I still have family there, and will always consider it home,” he said.

Burney is the boyfriend of Chef Heather Lincoln, who operates Trail Café and Grill on U.S. 41 in North Naples. Trail Café and Locale Eatery are both owned by the Lincoln family but the breakfast-lunch dining concepts do not share menus.

“It’s a different menu. The menu is a little bit smaller,” Lincoln said. “The take on the dishes will be completely different as well.”

Locale Eatery, 11121 Health Park Blvd., Suite 300, is open 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Mondays through Fridays, and 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. The café seats about 30 inside and 20 outside at umbrella tables. For more information call 239-592-1111.

1376,Get to know these fearless female space explorers,"CLOSE These brave women are here to remind you that you can do anything. Rachael L Thomas, FLORIDA TODAY

Here on the Space Coast we’ll soon be launching some incredible female astronauts for the first time since 2011. But before commercial spaceflight with astronauts happens later this year, learn about the fearless female space explorers.

There is a reason NASA has embraced the term crewed instead of manned when talking about human spaceflight, because since 2013 the space agency has had equal parts female and male astronaut classes.

There are more inspiring women than can fit into one article but let's meet a few, shall we?

A Virgin Galactic test pilot

Kelly Latimer is a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force and now is a test pilot for Virgin Galactic. Latimer has logged more than 6,200 hours flying 40 different aircraft, including NASA's space shuttle carrier aircraft and the agency's airborne observatory, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, known as SOFIA.

With Virgin Galactic, Latimer will fly SpaceShipTwo -- and later this year she may be responsible for piloting the space plane with the first paying astronauts on board.



“I always had this passion to be an astronaut, just from as long as I can remember that’s what I’ve wanted to do,” Latimer said.



Watch the video below to hear why Latimer became a test pilot.

Russia’s only current woman cosmonaut

Russia flew the first two women in space, starting with Valentina Tereshkova in 1963. While Russia launched a woman into space years before the U.S. space program, only two women have flown for Roscosmos since 1984. The Russian space agency currently only has one female cosmonaut: Anna Kikina.

She is currently training in Star City, Russia, with other cosmonauts and astronauts but does not have a spaceflight planned right now. NASA astronaut Christina Koch recently bumped into Kikina during their training.

I’m not usually the type to fan girl. But when you bump into the one current woman cosmonaut and you’re both training in the same building, it’s hard not to. She was learning manual Soyuz docking and I was co-pilot training. Honored to share the same uniform as you, Анна Кикина! pic.twitter.com/ZhQ1ChZSVC — Christina H Koch (@Astro_Christina) October 19, 2018

Laura Seward Forczyk, the owner of Astralytical, a space consulting firm, told Ars Technica last September the current Russian culture isn’t supportive of women in “high-powered careers.”



Here’s hoping Kikina inspires more girls and women in Russia to apply for the next cosmonaut class, which is open to people over 35 years old with specific degrees in STEM fields.

The first African-American woman to fly in space

In 1961, Alan Shepard was the first American to launch into space on Freedom 7. It would take more than three decades before an African American woman would visit space. That incredible human was Dr. Mae Jemison.

Jemison became the first black woman to visit the International Space Station in 1992. Now 62, she has continued to inspire people of color to pursue careers in science, technology, engineers and math fields with her company the Jemison Group.

Friday’s Google Doodle for International Women's Day includes a quote from Jemison, “Never be limited by other people’s limited imaginations.” According to Space.com the quote comes from Jemison's 2009 speech at the Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students.

NASA's first female astronauts to fly on Boeing's CST-Starliner

This year NASA’s commercial crew spacecraft by SpaceX and Boeing are set to launch U.S. astronauts from Cape Canaveral for the first time since 2011.



NASA announced the first nine astronauts to fly on Boeing’s CST-100 and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon last August, including veteran astronaut Suni Williams and NASA astronaut Nicole Aunapu Mann.

Williams has made two trips to the International Space Station totaling 322 days flying on both the Space Shuttle and Russian Soyuz spacecraft.

When others said you couldn't, you said ""We can do it!"" 💪

To the pioneers of space, our #Starliner teammates and @Commercial_Crew astronauts @AstroDuke and @Astro_Suni, thank you for building the future and daring to explore. #InternationalWomensDay#BalanceForBetterpic.twitter.com/PoCMim9GJJ — Boeing Space (@BoeingSpace) March 8, 2019

With more than 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft, Williams served in the U.S. Navy flying helicopters on relief and combat missions. Later, she became a test pilot and instructor. Williams was deployed when she was selected to be a NASA astronaut in 1998.

Williams told News 6 last August the gender of an astronaut or pilot shouldn't matter.

""When I was a helicopter pilot, when I did my first spacewalk, when I was living on the space station ... the helicopter doesn't know if I'm a girl or a boy,"" Williams said. ""The space station doesn't know, the spacesuit doesn't know. So why should it really matter, right?""

The first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner will be Mann's first trip to space. If an uncrewed flight slated for no earlier than April goes well that launch will happen in late summer.



Mann earned the nickname “Duke” as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps. She served on combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and as a test pilot for the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet. Mann was selected as part of the 2013 NASA astronaut class -- the first class to be equal parts men and women.

She told News 6 last August after her assignment on the Boeing Starliner she hopes the return to human spaceflight in the U.S. will empower the next generation of space explorers.



""Hopefully, it motivates them to study hard in school and think about what they want to do and think about how they want to contribute to this mission to exploring space,"" Mann said.

The first all-women spacewalking team

CLOSE A spacewalk scheduled for March will be the first every conducted by all-female crew. Rachael L Thomas, FLORIDA TODAY

Astronauts working on the International Space Station have completed 213 spacewalks since 1998. However, on March 29 NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Anne McClain will become the first women to conduct a spacewalk without any men.

Canadian Space Agency flight controller Kristen Facciol announced on Twitter March 1 she will be on console while McClain and Koch conduct the first all-female spacewalk.

As a young girl, @Astro_Christina dreamed of going to space. Next week, that dream becomes a reality when she launches to the @Space_Station!

McClain has been working on the space station since December and will conduct another spacewalk with NASA astronaut Nick Hague on March 22, according to NASA.

Koch and Hague launch for the space station March 14.

1377,4 men arrested after brutal beating of Pasco teen,"NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) - Geoffrey Lehman of New Port Richey was just walking home from school when he noticed a group of men following him.

Lehman texted his mother to say he thought he was being followed. She called as soon as she received the text, but by that time, the men attacked Lehman and stole his wallett, backpack and cell phone.

""His injuries were really bad. He got a fractured gum line and they kicked out three teeth, a couple of them he feels are loose,"" said Lehman's mother Stephanie Byrd.

A few days after the attack, Pasco County sheriff's deputies arrested 21-year-old Austin Emanuel and charged him with aggravated battery and robbery. Later, they arrested Emanuel's cousin, 24-year-old Justin Schreffler.

Over the weekend, during an episode of LivePD deputies arrested 19-year-old Khristian Schreffler and his brother, 23-year-old Trenton Schreffler.

Byrd and her son saw the arrest play out on TV.

""We just started screaming with happiness that they finally got 'em,"" said Byrd.

The one thing they can't understand is why Lehman was followed and attacked.

""We want to know why. I mean, just by the looks of him, he's a baby, he's a little boy and these guys were grown adults, 19, 21 and 23 and 24-years-old. Grown adults. What was going through their head when they did that,"" said Byrd, through tears.

Her son returned to school on Monday, but the family is facing a number of medical bills and will have to pay for facial reconstruction to replace his missing teeth.

Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco praised the teen for having the courage to report the crime after the attack.

""He's a hero. He's a hero because he stood up and said something and he notified law enforcement and because of that, these four individuals are going to be arrested and we hope prosecuted and we hope they go to prison,"" said Nocco.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pasco-county/four-men-arrested-after-brutal-beating-of-pasco-teen/1841006061,2019-03-11T23:02:55Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1380,"Orlando teacher accused of molesting student may have other victims, officials say","ORLANDO, Fla. - The Orange County elementary school teacher accused of molesting a student could have more possible victims, according to an arrest warrant.

Records show Julio Soto, 49, a teacher at Castle Creek Elementary School, was taken into custody last week after a student said Soto touched her inappropriately.

The girl, who sprained her arm in her physical education class last month, said Soto is her teacher for part of the day, normally for the afternoon portion, according to the warrant.

[RELATED: Orlando elementary teacher remains in jail after molestation allegation | Elementary school teacher​ arrested on child molestation charge, officials say]

Because she was injured, she couldn't take part in the activities in her physical education class and was sitting out to the side when Soto approached her and asked her to come upstairs and fix her test, deputies said.

The girl told investigators she agreed to go with him to his classroom, which is located on the second floor, the warrant said.

When they got upstairs, Soto told the girl he was going to try to find her tickle spot and began touching her above her clothing and eventually underneath it, deputies said.

When she told him to stop, Soto replied, ""Oh, OK,"" and stopped, then did it again, and again stopped when she told him to, according to the warrant.

Soto went back to her desk while the girl finished her test. When she was done, he told her there were two minutes left of the physical education class and that she should go back downstairs, deputies said.

The girl said she asked Soto if anyone could see them in the classroom and he said they couldn't because a privacy paper was in place over the door, according to the warrant.

Deputies said the girl didn't initially tell her parents about the alleged incident because she was afraid of how they would react, but she eventually told her friends because she ""couldn't take it anymore,"" the warrant said.

Soto was taken into custody at a Publix shopping plaza located at the intersection of Chuluota Road and East Colonial Drive, about 2 miles away from the school.

Since his arrest, Soto has been placed on administrative leave and will not be placed in a classroom while there is an open internal investigation.

He's been teaching at Castle Creek Elementary since August 2015.

Parents on Monday didn't comment about the allegations but said they received a voicemail from Principal Monica Johnson about Soto's arrest.

""We take any and all allegations very seriously, and the safety of our students is my first priority,"" Johnson said in the recorded message.

Soto's defense attorney told an Orange County judge on Saturday that his client has no criminal history and is the father of an 11-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy.

Soto on Monday remained at the Orange County Jail without bond and has been ordered to stay away from the alleged victim and minors.

Officials said detectives are investigating possible other victims. Anyone with information is asked to call 407-836-4357.

1382,You don't like Trump? It doesn't give you the right to harass his supporters,"CLOSE The bus aide told deputies ""I was personally offended,"" and ""I totally regret doing this."" VIDEO CONTRIBUTED BY MARTIN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE

Three days before a Martin County bus aide allegedly ripped a ""Make America Great Hat"" off a 14-year-old student, an 18-year-old Oklahoma student was charged with assault and battery after he allegedly demanded a classmate remove a similar ""MAGA"" hat, then knocked the hat off the younger kid's head when he didn't comply.

The same day that incident occurred, Feb. 25, an 81-year-old man was allegedly assaulted by a much younger man outside a ShopRite in New Jersey in a physical altercation over a hat.

Take a wild guess what the hat said.

More: Is the American Dream in trouble for 'Our Kids?' | Gil Smart

Donald Trump — in his foes' telling — is a uniquely malevolent figure in our collective history. Some think him racist, misogynist, a profaner of all things good and decent and tolerant. He, and by extension his supporters, make some people feel ""unsafe.""

For some people, that becomes justification to lash out.

In Martin County last week, 14-year-old Gunnar Johansson, a student at Hidden Oaks Middle School, boarded the bus the morning of March 7 wearing his MAGA hat. Students could wear a hat that day if they'd made a donation to the March of Dimes.

A bus aide, who has not yet been publicly identified, was having none of it.

Gunnar Johansson, 14, was told by a bus aide to remove his Make America Great Again hat. (Photo: SCREENSHOT FROM WPTV)

Surveillance video captures her saying, ""Boy, if you don't take that hat off on this bus ... take it off.""

""Why?"" Johansson asks. She provides no reason; instead she demands: ""Take the hat off, now.""

Johansson instead walks to his seat. The video, obscured so it doesn't identify other kids, doesn't capture the aide tearing the hat off his head, but someone is heard saying ""You can't do that,"" and the aide responds, ""Turn around.""

""Am I in trouble for that?"" Johansson asks. ""Yes you are,"" the aide responds.

Now it's the aide who's in trouble.

Johansson's parents called the Martin County Sheriff's Office and deputies interviewed the aide, who said she was ""totally offended"" — but added, ""I totally regret doing this.""

That's not good enough.

Should there be sufficient evidence to charge the aide, those charges should be filed.

It's not freedom of speech or the fact Johansson is a child, though that's part of it. The bigger issue is this: We don't assault one another in this country because of our political views.

You don't like Trump? Good for you. There's a lot not to like. But however malicious you may think the man and his presidency, however ""unsafe"" he makes you feel, it does not give you the right to make others unsafe.

I can't believe I actually have to write this. But apparently, I do.

For while the vast majority of those who dislike Trump would never do such a thing, many of the comments on TCPalm's Facebook page justified the aide's actions. Said one: ""If you support a misogynist, narcissistic, pathologically lying, bully expect to get harassed.""

Nice.

But it's harassment in the name of morality, of course.

And here's the thing: the ""narrative"" is that Trump supporters are uniquely violent. Last month, for example, a Trump fan allegedly attacked a BBC cameraman at a rally in El Paso. The story ran in most major news outlets.

Stories like the ones in Martin County, in Oklahoma, in New Jersey? They're far more likely to be treated as local stories. They're picked up by Fox News and other conservative outlets; but I don't see that CNN or the New York Times or Time magazine — all of which reported on the BBC cameraman attack — picked up any of these stories.

So the narrative is reinforced: It's Trump supporters who are violent. And some are. But when things like the Martin County bus incident occur, it's brushed off. It's just some hothead; it's not emblematic of anything.

I think it is.

And I think, whomever you support politically, we all need to rein it in. Because if you think the other side is so bad that what that bus aide did is OK — rest assured, there are those on the ""other side"" who'll gladly return the favor next time around.

And if we get to that point, the loss of a hat will be the least of our worries.

In light of the controversial ""Leaving Neverland"" documentary, ""The Simpsons"" is yanking one of its classic episodes featuring Michael Jackson.According to the Wall Street Journal, the show is removing the 1991 episode titled ""Stark Raving Dad"" which featured Jackson's voice as a character named Leon Kompowsky, a patient Homer Simpson meets in a mental institution who claims to be the singer.The episode has been a fan favorite since it debuted, giving the world an earworm in the form of a birthday song Jackson sings to the Lisa Simpson character.But ""Simpsons"" longtime executive producer James L. Brooks told the publication that in light of the disturbing claims made in the HBO documentary, pulling the episode ""feels clearly the only choice to make.""""The guys I work with -- where we spend our lives arguing over jokes -- were of one mind on this,"" Brooks said.HBO is owned by CNN's parent company. ""Leaving Neverland"" chronicles allegations by James Safechuck and Wade Robson that Jackson sexually abused them over a period of several years when they were children.Jackson, who died in 2009, was accused in 1993 of sexually molesting a boy and charged with seven counts of child molestation for allegations related to another boy in 2003.Jackson settled out of court with the 1993 accuser and was acquitted in the 2003 case.He maintained his innocence while he was alive.Jackson's family has denied the allegations and condemned the documentary, calling it a ""public lynching"" and Jackson's accusers ""admitted liars,"" in reference to sworn statements made by both Safechuck and Robson while Jackson was alive that he did not molest them.The family also said in their statement that ""Michael was subjected to a thorough investigation which included a surprise raid of Neverland and other properties as well as a jury trial where Michael was found to be COMPLETELY INNOCENT.""Brooks said the ""Simpsons"" producers are taking steps to remove the episode from all platforms including on television, streaming services and Blu-ray/DVD box sets.""This was a treasured episode,"" Brooks said.

1390,Martin County bus aide offended by MAGA hat grabs it off head of 14-year-old boy,"CLOSE The bus aide told deputies ""I was personally offended,"" and ""I totally regret doing this."" VIDEO CONTRIBUTED BY MARTIN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE

MARTIN COUNTY — A Martin County school bus aide is accused of yelling at a student to take off a Trump hat before ripping it off his head.

On Thursday afternoon, deputies said they got a call from the boy's mother, Jacquelyn Putt, saying her son, Gunnar Johansson, 14, got onto the bus Tuesday and a bus aide grabbed his Make America Great Again hat off his head.

Deputies said Johansson attends Hidden Oaks Middle School and students were allowed to wear a hat to school if they made a donation to March of Dimes.

The bus aidewho took Johansson's hat told deputies she asked the 14-year-old to take off his hat multiple times and he refused. She told deputies she then gently removed it from his head and asked him to put it in his backpack because she didn't know students were allowed to wear a hat that day.

The woman later told deputies ""I was personally offended"" and that ""I totally regret doing this.""

Johansson told deputies the bus aide told him to ""never wear that nonsense on this bus again."" He told deputies the aide grabbed his hat and then gave it back to him. Johansson said he then put the hat in his bag and wore it after he left the bus for the rest of the day.

“Boy, if you don’t that that hat off this bus … take it off. Take that hat off … take that hat off…” the bus aide, who has been identified, is heard saying.

The Sheriff's Office was alerted on Tuesday, said spokeswoman Christine Weiss. Law enforcement initially was not involved but late Thursday, Johansson's mother requested an investigation, Weiss said.

""A report was taken and an investigation is underway,"" she said.

The Martin County School District said it also was looking into the incident.

Dianne Falls, a spokeswoman for the School District, issued the following statement Friday: ""The district is aware of the family's allegation; we take it very seriously, and we are currently gathering all of the facts as part of our investigation. To protect the integrity of the investigation, we cannot comment beyond that.""

""I do not have a problem with Gunnar,"" the bus aide wrote in a witness statement. ""We have always gotten along, and I am sorry for what I did and I hope he forgives me.""

1392,17-year-old boy accused of sexually assaulting girl at knifepoint,"Police said Brandon Mathieu, 17, attacked a young girl on her way to school.

LAUDERHILL, Fla. - A 17-year-old boy was arrested Tuesday after police said he sexually assaulted a young girl at knifepoint on her way to school in Lauderhill last month.

Brandon Mathieu, of Lauderhill, faces multiple charges, including sexual assault with a weapon, extortion and robbery.

According to court documents, the victim was walking to Lauderhill Middle School on Feb. 11 when she noticed Mathieu who was riding a bicycle near the local Boys & Girls Club, but she continued walking. The victim told police that she knew Mathieu because he used to attend to her school.

As she walked along an access ramp that crosses over Florida's Turnpike, she said Mathieu dropped his bike and grabbed her from behind, the documents said. Mathieu put his left arm around her neck and used his right hand to point a knife toward her, the documents said.

According the victim, Mathieu said, ""Get on your knees and don't scream, or I'll kill you.""

Mathieu pushed her to her knees and forced the victim to perform oral sex, but the victim resisted, the documents said. Mathieu choked her and during the struggle, he threatened to cut her with the knife, the documents said. Eventually Mathieu “apologized” to the victim and fled the scene, the documents said.

A witness driving along the Florida's Turnpike stopped his car after he saw two people fighting on the access ramp. When he got to the ramp, he found the victim crying and alerted authorities. The victim suffered cuts and bruises during the attack, police said.

The victim was able to positively identify Mathieu from a photo lineup, police said.

Mathieu is currently being held at Broward County's Main Jail in Fort Lauderdale.

1393,Thousands sign petition in support of huskies after 4-year-old boy's hand bitten off,"Advertisement Thousands sign petition in support of huskies after 4-year-old boy's hand bitten off Share Shares Copy Link Copy

More than 85,000 people have signed a petition in support of two dogs taken by animal control in Utah after a 4-year-old boy had his hand bitten off. The boy stuck his sock-covered arm in a gap between the ground and a solid vinyl fence in his backyard Sunday, Layton Fire Battalion Chief Jason Cook said. The husky bit off the boy’s entire hand and 2 to 3 inches of his arm, Cook said.A helicopter flew the boy to a hospital in Salt Lake City, where he had surgery, Cook said. He’s doing well and is expected to survive, officials said. Authorities couldn’t find his hand and are almost certain the dog ingested it, he said.Medical personnel and animal control officials briefly considered putting down the dog to retrieve the hand for reattachment, but the surgeon determined that wasn’t a viable option, Cook said.The husky will be quarantined for 10 days, said Rhett Nicks, director for Davis County Animal Care and Control. It was the animal’s first reported bite, Cook said. Animal control was holding another husky that lives at the house but wasn’t involved. Nicks told ABC 4 it is possible the huskies, named Polar and Bear, could be put down. ""There's a severe injury to a human,"" Nicks said. ""So, we are doing a dangerous dog investigation which could range from nothing being done up to an including euthanasia.""Jessica Nusz, a friend of the dogs' owner, said the owner relies on the dogs for support and called the incident a ""freak accident."" ""Bear, who was playing with what he thought was a toy, bit down too hard and didn't see that there was a child on the other side of the fence. With him being a dog he thought it was a game of tug of war and he bit down too hard and took a lower portion of his arm,"" Nusz wrote in a petition to save the pups. ""This situation is unfortunate on both sides.""A GoFundMe page for Polar and Bear has raised $400. It’s not known if the dog owner will face consequences. The dogs were properly fenced in at the house in a neighborhood in Layton, a city of about 80,000 residents about 25 miles north of Salt Lake City, Cook said. Both families had recently moved in, he said.Cook said he doesn’t know if the boy was right-handed or not but that he should be able to adapt because he’s so young.“He’ll kind of grow into his dexterity,” Cook said. “But it’s certainly life-changing. It’s just a sad turn of events for the young, little guy.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/thousands-sign-petition-in-support-of-dogs-after-4-year-old-boy-s-hand-bitten-off/26716552,2019-03-06T15:26:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

1403,"Murder victim was CI, witness in drug case of suspect's son","Two men have been arrested: La’Mathis Eugene Hamilton, 27, on first-degree murder; and Allison Mells, 53, on principal to first-degree murder.

A day after police charged La’Mathis Eugene Hamilton, 27, with first-degree murder in the death of Roland Henry Lanctot, they arrested Allison Mells, 53, on a charge of principal to first-degree murder.

Ocala police on Tuesday said the murder of Lanctot, 61, whose body was discovered by a relative in a densely wooded area off a busy road a few months ago, was tied to his being a key witness in a drug deal that involved Mells' son, Kenneth Mills.

According to Ocala Police Department Detective Richard Tuck’s report, Lanctot was a confidential informant and had conducted several drug purchases under the direction of the Unified Drug Enforcement Strike Team, which included deals with Kenneth Mills, 31.

Marion County Jail records show Mills has been booked into the facility on several charges, such as sale and possession of cocaine and smuggling contraband into a detention facility. State records indicate Mills served time for sale and possession of drugs and burglary. He was released from prison in 2011.

Lanctot was found dead in his tent in the area of Northwest Blitchton Road and Northwest 33rd Avenue the afternoon of Jan. 17 by his sister. Earlier this month, Ocala police received information that Hamilton, otherwise known as “Bread Boy,” was connected to Lanctot’s death.

Tuck interviewed a person who claimed that Mells paid Hamilton to kill Lanctot. The person alleged Mells purchased a firearm and said he knew Lanctot snitched on his son. He said he became aware of Lanctot’s identity during a court procedure, reports state.

Tuck was told that Lanctot was shot three times in the face. He was told the shooter was paid anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000 and that Mells went to a bank to get a loan to pay for the killing. Tuck also was told about Mells and Hamilton asking about bullets, the report states.

Tuck and Detective Robert Brown found the person who knew about the bullets at a hotel. The person identified Hamilton as wanting to go to Rural King to buy .38-caliber rounds for a gun he was purchasing.

The detectives also obtained documents from Florida Credit Union that showed Mells received a $2,500 loan on Jan. 28.

On Monday, Hamilton was found by police officials and was transported to the Ocala Police Department for questioning. He told detectives he sold a .38-caliber revolver to Mells when his assistance was requested to help kill Lanctot. Hamilton said he went to the hotel for bullets for the gun. Hamilton said Mells paid him $3,000 to kill Lanctot, but he denied doing it. He said he drove Mills to a gas station so Mills would kill Lanctot. Hamilton said Mills got out of the vehicle and killed Lanctot, the reports state.

Officers found Mells, 53, on Tuesday and he was taken to the police department for questioning. He asked to talk to the top officer, Police Chief Greg Graham.

Tuck said Mells told the chief “they keep trying to say I paid someone to kill someone.” He told the chief he heard he paid $5,000 to $10,000 to kill someone, the report states.

Graham told Mells that if he wanted to talk about his case, he would have to read him his rights.

After being read his rights, Mells told the chief he has a court date coming up and was going to turn himself in because “the word on the street was that some guy was saying he paid someone to do this,” according to the arrest report.

Mells told the chief his son has an open court case and was offered a two- to three-year sentence. According to the report, he asked the chief, “Why would he kill someone for his son to keep him out of prison for two years when his son has already been to prison twice before.”

Detectives tried to interview Mells, but he refused to talk to them. He was arrested and charged with principal to first-degree murder.

Mells declined to answer questions posed by the Star-Banner as he was being led to a patrol vehicle.

Court records show Mells has had several drug convictions and prosecutors recently filed new drug charges against him.

The detectives also obtained documents from Florida Credit Union that showed Mells received a $2,500 loan on Jan. 28.

On Monday, Hamilton was found by police officials and was transported to the Ocala Police Department for questioning. He told detectives he sold a .38-caliber revolver to Mells when his assistance was requested to help kill Lanctot. Hamilton said he went to the hotel for bullets for the gun. Hamilton said Mells paid him $3,000 to kill Lanctot, but he denied doing it. He said he drove Mills to a gas station so Mills would kill Lanctot. Hamilton said Mills got out of the vehicle and killed Lanctot, the reports state.

Officers found Mells, 53, on Tuesday and he was taken to the police department for questioning. He asked to talk to the top officer, Police Chief Greg Graham.

Tuck said Mells told the chief “they keep trying to say I paid someone to kill someone.” He told the chief he heard he paid $5,000 to $10,000 to kill someone, the report states.

Graham told Mells that if he wanted to talk about his case, he would have to read him his rights.

After being read his rights, Mells told the chief he has a court date coming up and was going to turn himself in because “the word on the street was that some guy was saying he paid someone to do this,” according to the arrest report.

Mells told the chief his son has an open court case and was offered two to three years sentence. According to the report, he asked the chief, “Why would he kill someone for his son to keep him out of prison for two years when his son has already been to prison twice before.”

Detectives tried to interview Mells, but he refused to talk to them. He was arrested and charged with principal to first-degree murder.

Mells declined to answer questions posed by the Star-Banner as he was being led to a patrol vehicle.

Court records show Mells has had several drug convictions and prosecutors recently filed new drug charges against him.

Why?

Southwest Floridians are becoming more health-conscious, says Mike Young, founder of the SWFL Veg Fest, which took place in late February. The educational event, in its third year, attracted thousands to Bonita Springs. Its goal: to promote a plant-based lifestyle, compassion for animals and environmental conservation.

That goal is shared by a new generation looking to incorporate more vegan and plant-based food into their daily lives.

Young, 49, credits local health initiatives like the Blue Zones Project for instilling that mindset in the community.

""The people here are intelligent and want to live longer,"" Young said.

As plant-based lifestyles are becoming more mainstream, it's gradually changing the local foodie landscape, which a Fort Myers chef and area nutrition experts agree is for the better.

Veganism versus plant-based diet

Veganism is a lifestyle choice that's not just about eating a healthy whole foods diet. Vegans exclude all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals and the environment, according to The Vegan Society. There are many ways to embrace the vegan lifestyle. One thing all vegans have in common is a diet avoiding all animal products, including fish, shellfish, dairy, eggs and honey —as well as products like leather and any tested on animals.

Whereas veganism is more a lifestyle, the whole food, plant-based diet emphasizes eating whole fruits and veggies, whole grains, and staying away from or reducing the intake of animal products and processed foods.

Technically speaking, vegans can consume Oreos for every meal of the day and still call themselves as such since the cookies don't include animal products. For obvious reasons, Tampa-based vegan nutritionist and physical trainer Marcus Watts doesn't recommend doing so.

The quintessential vegan diet doesn't consist solely of tofu and bean sprouts. There's a long list of fruits and veggies perfect for breakfast, lunch and dinner. All it takes is an education and some creativity.

Watts, 35, works with clients from Tampa to Miami to help get them in shape through exercise and diet. He frequents Southwest Florida on a weekly basis. He's one of the many wellness experts based in and around the area.

""Some people think it’s a hippie thing,"" said Watts about veganism. But people from all walks of life can incorporate a plant-based, vegan or vegetarian diet. Even those hardcore meat eaters looking to minimize their meat consumption and eat more whole foods.

""Why am I vegan? I know too much. I don't want to harm anything and I want to make less of a footprint on the environment,"" he said.

What it means to go vegan or adopt a healthier lifestyle

It can also be beneficial to one's health.

Watts saw the benefits of a plant-based diet firsthand.

His meals used to revolve around fried chicken until doctors in 2013 discovered blood clots in his left arm and collar bone, which then led to a pulmonary embolism, a condition where one or more arteries in the lungs become blocked by a blood clot. He was a former overseas professional basketball player then.

Watts turned to food for medicine. He adopted a plant-based diet. Over time, he was able to turn his health around. Two years ago he went vegan.

""Because of the diet change, I started lifting more weights and running faster. It was a very eye-opening experience,"" he said. The benefits weren't just physical but also psychological.

""If I had my way, everyone would just consume plants,"" Watts said. As a vegan, he's a firm believer in consuming whole fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. He also sees more people are willing now more than ever to live that lifestyle. (Photo: Josue Cardosa)

Watts said he's not alone in his thinking. Over the years, he said, he's seen a gradual shift in the way Americans see food — as fuel rather than just taste. Especially in places like Southwest Florida where there's a plethora of farmers markets, wellness centers and nutrition experts.

""There are so many more healthy and vegan options now. New York City has become the holy grail then there's Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.

""Why is there a shift? I think it comes down to news reports and documentaries showing animal brutality and the environmental impact of the foods we eat. There are also many celebrities on social media promoting healthy lifestyles.""

On Instagram alone, searching hashtags like #vegan and #healthy food pulls up hundreds upon hundreds of photos of visually-appealing nutritious meals and snacks.

How is it shaping the food culture in Southwest Florida

Chef Brooke Wagenheim, of Chef Brooke's Natural Cafe in Fort Myers, understood the importance of nutrition at an early age.

She'd forage the northeast wilderness for berries and plants to help her grandma in the kitchen cook Sunday dinners.

She was taught the value of organic and vegan cooking as a young chef. She moved from New York to Minneapolis before settling in Florida. She's specialized in vegan cuisine for the past 25 years.

“We’re not just granola and sprouts.” Chef Brooke Wagenheim of Chef Brooke's Natural Cafe

While veganism has been around a long time, Wagenheim, who caters to the many long-time vegans in the area, said she's noticed new customers come in, some newly vegan and others interested in its health benefits.

""I've found that the newer vegans are more apt to be excited about a place that offers more vegan options,"" Wagenheim said.

She's owned her Fort Myers cafe — near South Cleveland Avenue off Boy Scout Drive — for the past 10 years.

Don't be fooled by her restaurant's name.

""We're not just about granola and sprouts,"" Wagenheim said.

The organic cafe offers an extensive menu of health-focused smoothies and juices, breakfast and bakery items, salads, sandwiches and wraps. You can add protein to any platter, everything from tofu to tempeh, and for meat eaters, beef and wild salmon. The options are endless when it comes to implementing healthy whole foods to your diet, she said.

But as vegan and plant-based diets have become more mainstream, there are those new products out there catering to meat eaters.

Gone are the days of just tofu

There's dairy alternatives to milk — wrung from almonds, coconuts and oats.

Meat substitutes like the Impossible Burger.

What makes a burger impossible? Using a vegan, plant-based patty that sizzles and ""bleeds"" like real meat and even tastes like it too. Heme, made directly from plants, is what gives the burger its meaty flavor, according to Impossible Foods. Impossible Foods was founded in 2011 with a goal to eliminate the need to use animals to make food. Instead, making meat, dairy and fish directly from plants.

Wagenheim said she isn't a fan. She says products like the Impossible Burger are genetically modified and, in the long run, not the best nutritionally, although it is better on the environment than beef. She prefers whole foods like fruits and vegetables.

Watts said these types of products go against old-school veganism. But there are plenty of vegan burger options such as those made of black beans and lentils.

He does say that beefy-tasting products like the Impossible Burger can help introduce meat eaters to a healthier diet.

""If a product is similar to what they know it can help open their mind and get them to try it. Then maybe they'll say, 'OK I tried that, so maybe I’ll try tofu,'"" Watts said.

1407,"'The hardest days': Dedication was in the DNA of Liberty high school baseball coach, wife","Corey Crum was a beloved baseball coach at Liberty County High School. (Photo: Special to the Democrat)

Tim Davis was scrambling.

After previously serving as Liberty County High’s head baseball coach, Davis volunteered to return for one season in 2018. Practice was scheduled to start and Davis – a Liberty County alum and former pitcher at Florida State and in the major leagues – needed an assistant to also coach the junior-varsity team.

The moment Davis talked with Corey Crum, Davis knew he found the perfect candidate. The setup worked so well, the feedback so positive, it was agreed Crum would become the varsity head coach in 2019.

“So down to earth, a guy who worked as hard as anyone I’ve ever seen work – and Corey really loved those kids,” Davis, an assistant principal at Liberty County High, said Monday morning. “It's one of the hardest days I can remember. We will never forget the impact he’s had on us.

""It’s tragic.”

The Bristol community – and the baseball community in the Big Bend – is in mourning. Crum, 39, and his wife Shana Crum, 41, were killed Sunday afternoon after they were electrocuted at the school’s baseball field in Bristol. Their son Chase, 14, was injured in the accident that occurred during a volunteer workday to clean up the field.

According to Liberty County Sheriff’s Office, Corey Crum was operating a boom lift when the lift touched the overhead power lines, electrocuting him. Shana rushed to her husband and was electrocuted as well. Chase, near the accident when it happened, was injured but is expected to recover after being released from UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville.

'Those boys absolutely loved them'

Bristol, 50 miles west of Tallahassee, is again being tested.

The small community suffered severe damage last October when Hurricane Michael ripped through the Panhandle. Residents responded without complaint, because that’s what they do, clearing debris and helping neighbors get back on their feet.

With that mindset, Crum was volunteering Sunday to install the concrete pilings for a new scoreboard after the old one was damaged during Michael's wrath.

Tragedy struck, again.

Disbelief and tears, again.

Crum was a newcomer, recently moving to the area. Yet his impact reached far beyond Bristol.

The Crum family tree is established and respected in Wakulla County. Corey attended Wakulla High and owned a concrete business, driving at least 30 minutes daily to Liberty County High for practices and games. He fished. He hunted. And, boy, he loved baseball.

If Crum was at the field, his wife Shana was at his side. They were a team – considerate, helpful, always available and fully invested in the program.

Crum was known to be a man of quiet and humble dignity, but coached with tough love. Shana was a friendly and smiling face. She was a health aide at Hosford Elementary and Junior High School and once ran a day care center. Shana hails from the Millender family, another well-known and respected name in Carrabelle and along the Panhandle coastline.

If you didn’t know any better, one would think Corey and Shana were born and raised in Bristol.

Bulldogs – and baseball – for life.

Jeremiah Waller, whose son Austin is the team's starting sophomore catcher, was among the 30 parents and players at the workday. Waller, who works for Talquin Electric, was on the opposite side of the field when the accident occurred. He immediately realized the situation and cleared the area. He says the community is heartbroken.

""They came into our little community and came here with a plan,"" Waller said. ""He let everyone know his plan from the start and he wanted to do something great with this baseball team. He got more out of those kids than anyone I've seen. It was amazing to see.""

Fellow Bristol resident Brent Holland said no task was beyond Crum. Holland's son Brock is a senior on the team, and Brock's older brother Brody helped coach with Crum on the Bulldogs’ junior varsity team last season. Crum's philosophy and vision for the program were shared by players and parents during this season's opening month.

“No matter what had to be done, Corey would do it and you knew it would be done right,” Brent Holland said. “And Shana’s love for Corey, everyone around could see it. Those boys absolutely loved them; everyone here fell in love with Corey and his family. It was like they lived here their entire lives.

""It's going to take a long time to get over this.”

'Everyone is devastated'

While Tuesday’s game against Sneads has been canceled, Davis expects the team to resume the season, saying he believes that’s what Corey would have wanted.

Crum’s brother Randall Crum, one of the area’s best power hitters back in the day at Wakulla High, spoke to the team Sunday night. He told players and parents gathered in the high school gymnasium after the incident that their coach would have wanted them to do their best and keep pressing forward.

That was Corey Crum’s DNA.

He coached youth league and travel team baseball. He helped with tryouts locally for the Tallahassee Tomahawks travel team organization. He once cut a hunting trip to Illinois short and flew from St. Louis to Jacksonville so his travel team could compete in a tournament.

Crum had the Class 1A Bulldogs off to a strong start, punctuated by a 3-1 win over rival and defending Class 1A state champion Port St. Joe Friday and a 10-run win over Cottondale Saturday. Duncan Hosford was a starting outfielder on last year's team and is playing at Chipola College in Marianna. He said Crum's message, one that focused on work ethic and effort, won't be forgotten.

""He was all about getting you ready for life,"" Hosford said.

Crum had also started a tradition of showing at the Bulldogs' field each Sunday to throw batting practice or hit ground balls to players. It started with one player's request for extra drills. Word spread and many times the entire team showed.

Wakulla High baseball coach Keith Anderson said Crum was the perfect fit for Liberty County's program. Anderson should know. He was Corey’s junior-varsity baseball coach when Crum attended Wakulla High. Anderson also was among the group that traveled to Illinois with Crum for the past five years to hunt deer. They spent most of the 15-hour driving talking family and baseball.

Late last week, the two spent communicating via text, checking in on each other's teams. Wakulla is scheduled to play Liberty County next month. It was a game the good friends had circled.

""Everyone is devastated,"" Anderson said. ""He loved coaching. Loved those kids. He was the type of guy who would give up his deer stand if it gave somebody else the chance at their first big deer. And Shana was always with him at the field. It's so sad. They are going to be missed.""

1409,Ocala scout soars with STEM drone project,"In between taking his award-winning ""First Response Medical Drone"" to state level competitions, Nick Ruppel found time to complete requirements to attain the rank of Eagle Scout.

Even the sky can't limit how high Eagle Scout Nick Ruppel will soar.

On March 25, the Forest High School senior will compete at the state level in a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) event in Lakeland after he placed first in the senior division in engineering at the local 2019 Big Springs STEM Fair with his project ""First Response Medical Drone.""

Ruppel, 18, built the four-engine helicopter style drone prototype, which is capable of carrying up to 10 pounds of medical supplies, with the goal of interaction between a fire station and an emergency scene up to four miles away.

""Scouting instilled in me the general idea of helping people,"" he said about the inspiration for his STEM project, which also is his senior year EMIT (Engineering and Manufacturing Institute of Technology) project at Forest High.

He said the concept is using a drone to asses emergency situations and to carry critical medical needs, such an automated external defibrillator or first aid supplies.

According to his research, drones modeled after his project, with a four-mile radius, stationed at each Ocala Fire Rescue Fire Station, would provide 93 percent coverage of the city.

His said his look to the future includes paramedic operators making initial evaluations of injuries by way of a television transmitter and delivering supplies with drones.

Ruppel's drone project also earned an award from the U.S. Air Force and a chance to compete in a Lockheed Martin Science Challenge in Orlando.

Tia P. Brown, with Marion County Public Schools, and director of the Big Springs STEM Fair, said the fair includes students from Marion and Sumter counties. She said there are generally about 200 projects judged and there is a quota of 32 projects that can qualify for the State Science and Engineering Fair.

""Nick is the first drone project that I have had the opportunity to take to the state fair. Other fair directors that reviewed his project at our state paperwork day mentioned their excitement to me about his project,"" she stated in an email.

""Nick’s project involves a drone that can deliver medical supplies to an emergency situation. This would be an incredible advancement in the medical field since emergency vehicles can only arrive to locations so fast. Think about places that are difficult to get to, such as in the mountains or in snowy regions. This type of invention could be a lifesaver to a lost and hurt hiker. I know that Nick’s abilities to invent and envision things people need for the future will greatly help our enhancements,"" Brown wrote.

Ruppel also is involved in robotics competitions and said he spends about ""90 percent of his time"" with EMIT and robotics.

Raymond James, sponsor of the Forest High School EMIT and First Robotics program, said Ruppel is a dedicated student. He said the young man puts his ""mind and his whole heart"" into his projects.

Ruppel is a Florida native. He moved to Ocala at age 4. He got involved in scouting as a Tiger Cub at age 6. He was awarded Eagle rank, the highest in Boy Scouts of America in February, after he completed all the requirements, including a project of community benefit.

He led six fellow scouts and six adults in a roughly 60-hour project to clean, upgrade and landscape an outdoor area at the entrance of the Ocala Shrine Club on Southeast Maricamp Road.

The project including cleaning the larger than life-size statue of a Shriner holding a child in one arm and the child's crutch in the other – reflecting the motto of ""love to the rescue"" – refurbishing the surrounding walkway, adding mulch, trimming shrubbery, cleaning the outdoor lighted sign and raising a new American flag.

Ruppel said encouragement from his parents, Jennifer and Bill Ruppel, and his brother, Robert, 20, who attained Eagle rank several years ago, motivated him to strive for Eagle.

Ruppel is a member of Troop 172, which is sponsored by Blessed Trinity Catholic Church. He has earned 30 merit badges.

Jennifer Ruppel said her son has ""always been a leader."" She said even in sixth grade, he came to class early every day to raise the flag and won an award from the American Legion.

""Nick is a leader in everything,"" she said.

Ruppel, who plans to attend the University of Central Florida to earn a degree in mechanical engineering, said ""scouting definitely gave me leadership skills.""",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190311/ocala-scout-soars-with-stem-drone-project?rssfeed=true,2019-03-11T11:01:36Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471

(Metropolitan Police of London via AP, File)

LONDON (AP) - British Home Secretary Sajid Javid faced criticism Saturday after the death of a U.K. teenager’s baby in a Syrian camp.

Shamima Begum, who had left London as a 15-year-old in 2015 to join the Islamic State group, had pleaded with British authorities before her baby was born to let her return to Britain to raise the child.

But Javid revoked her passport, saying Begum hadn’t shown any remorse. The teen had told newspaper reporters she didn’t have a problem with IS actions, including the beheading of captives.

Begum’s infant son died Friday. Begum’s family said the boy appeared to be in good health when he was born on Feb. 17. No clear cause of death has yet been given, but reports suggested he was having respiratory problems.

Fellow Conservative Party lawmaker Phillip Lee said Saturday he was “deeply concerned” by Javid’s handling of the case, suggesting he had taken a hard line in order to please populists.

He said it was clear 19-year-old Begum “holds abhorrent views,” but called her a child who was a product of British society. Britain had a moral duty to her and to her baby, he said.

When Begum first started speaking to reporters more than three weeks ago, she said the first two children she had given birth to since joining the extremist group had died of malnutrition and other ailments. She said she wanted to come home so she didn’t lose another child.

Her predicament sparked a national debate on how the U.K. should handle Britons who had joined the extremists and now seek to return because IS has lost its territory in Syria and Iraq.

The challenge faces other European countries as the final IS stronghold in Syria is on the brink of falling, giving its fighters and their often youthful spouses no place left to hide.

U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on the matter last month, saying European countries have a responsibility to take back and put on trial about 800 IS fighters who have been captured by U.S.-backed forces in Syria.

Begum is married to a Dutch national who joined IS extremists and has since been taken into custody. He said last week that he wanted to be able to live in the Netherlands with his wife and newborn son, who is now dead.

Kirsty McNeill, a director at Save the Children UK, said Britain should “take responsibility for their citizens” in Syria to prevent further unnecessary losses.

“It is possible the death of this baby boy and others could have been avoided,” she said.

Javid didn’t comment directly on the baby’s death. A government spokesman said “the death of any child is tragic” and reiterated the British government’s advice that citizens avoid travel to Syria.",http://www.wfla.com/national/official-criticized-after-baby-of-teen-who-joined-isis-dies-in-syria/1837685611,2019-03-09T22:32:59Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1414,"Toddler killed, woman injured in dog attack","ALACHUA COUNTY, Fla. - A toddler was killed and a woman was injured in a dog attack Friday morning at a home near High Springs, the Alachua County Sheriff's Office said.

It happened about 10:30 a.m. at a home on Northwest 210th Avenue, just west of Interstate 75.

According to the Sheriff's Office, dogs living at the home attacked two family members -- a 2-year-old boy and a woman. Deputies said the 2-year-old died from his injuries at the house and the woman was taken to an area hospital with traumatic injuries.

Detectives with the Sheriff's Office continue to investigate, though initial information indicates two dogs were involved in the attack on the family property and the injured woman fought them off, deputies said.

“This (is) an incredible tragedy for the family involved,” said Lt. Brett Rhodenizer, with the Sheriff's Office. “Our investigation will ultimately determine the facts that led up to the attack, but no answers will ever make up for the loss of a child.”

The dogs involved were seized by Alachua County Animal Services, and members of the Alachua County Crisis Team have responded to assist the family.

Officers with the neighboring High Springs and Alachua police departments also responded.

CLEARWATER, Fla. (WFLA) - A 16-year-old boy is in a heap of trouble with the law after deputies say he crashed a stolen car into a Clearwater home, then ran away.

Around 11:35 p.m. on Thursday, Deputies responded to a 911 call about a car that crashed into a home at 1354 Eastfield Drive.

Witnesses told deputies that multiple juveniles ran away from the scene after a 2015 Kia Soul crashed into the garage area of the occupied home. No one in the home was injured.

Deputies from the PCSO K-9 Unit and the PCSO Flight Unit responded to the scene and began tracking the subjects.

Deputies say they found the 16-year-old driver of the vehicle near the home. A 13-year-old passenger was also found near the crash site. Car crashes into Clearwater house

Deputies say the 16-year-old had stolen a family member's Kia Soul and was driving it on Eastfield Drive when he lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle left the roadway and crashed into a mailbox and a parked car before crashing into the home causing significant property damage.

Mark and Dawn Smith live in the home and were awakened by the crash. ""Went to bed and heard some loud noises, woke us up and again and I come running outside to a car that had run right through my garage,"" said Mark Smith.

The teens in the car ran away from the crash scene, but then came back because they forgot something important in the car. ""Then they all actually came back to get their phones and their backpacks,"" said Smith.

1420,Former juvenile detention officer accused of sexual battery of teen boys at Pinellas facility,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) – A former juvenile detention officer in Pinellas County is accused of having sexual contact with multiple boys at the juvenile detention center run by the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice and the state in Pinellas County.

Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri announced Joshua Harrison, 27, was arrested during a press conference on Tuesday. He said the investigation began on Jan. 30.

According to Gualtieri, Harrison allegedly sexually battered three 17-year-old male inmates as he was working the midnight shift at the detention center.

The investigation revealed Harrison was regularly passing notes to the boys. According to Gualtieri, Harrison was “grooming” them.

Harrison allegedly told the first victim he would give him and his mother money when the victim was released. He brought the boy contraband in the form of sandwiches and drinks.

The investigation revealed on Jan. 28, Harrison went into the first victim’s cell and began touching him and performed oral sex.

Gualtieri said Harrison played games like tic-tac-toe with the second victim and if Harrison won, the boy would have to expose himself. If the boy won, Harrison would bring him food.

On Jan. 21, Harrison reportedly sexually assaulted the boy in his cell.

According to the investigation, Harrison tried to grope a third victim in his cell, but Gualtieri said the boy tried to punch Harrison.

Gualtieri said two officers witnessed Harrison give two of the victims food and drink and one even witnessed Harrison leaving one of the victim’s cells, but neither officer reported the incidents to DJJ.

Gualtieri stressed the officers are not sheriff's office employees, but work for the DJJ.

In addition to the three victims, five other boys report Harrison asked them for oral and anal sex and boys would expose themselves to Harrison in exchange for food.

Harrison was fired Feb. 4 during the sheriff's office investigation.

He was arrested on Tuesday and is charged with sexual battery with custodial authority.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/former-juvenile-detention-officer-accused-of-sexual-battery-of-teen-boys-at-pinellas-facility/1829052880,2019-03-05T21:20:46Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1421,This Florida 7-year-old is smashing track and field records,"TAMPA, Fla. - When the 2028 Olympics come to Los Angeles, you might want to remember the name of a Florida 7-year-old boy already being dubbed the next Usian Bolt.

Rudolph Ingram Jr., also known as “Blaze the Great,” recently set a new 100-meter dash record for 8 and under at 13.48 seconds, which is just more than three seconds behind the record for the 17-and 18-year-old group set in 1987, according to USA Track & Field records.

Watching videos of his speed is truly amazing. The other kids competing against him don't even have a chance to catch up. He's that fast.

According to his Instagram account, Rudolph's top speeds go up to 15.63 mph.

Rudolph has almost 400,000 Instagram followers and his posts with his record-smashing races earn hundreds of thousands of views.

He’s also starting to receive praise from professional athletes, including LeBron James and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, according to WFTS. Blaze told the Tampa ABC station his goal is to play in the NFL.

On top of being an amazing budding athlete, he’s on the honor roll at school, according to his father.

In eight years when Blaze is old enough to compete in the Olympics don't be surprised to see his name again.

1429,REPORT: 9-year-old beaten with bamboo stick suffers life threatening injuries,"Benjamin Donahue is charged with cruelty to a child. Authorities say he beat a 9-year-old with a bamboo stick. (PHOTO: Santa Rosa Jail View)

Santa Rosa County Sheriff Office arrest a Milton man for spanking a 9-year-old so hard he sustained life threatening injuries.

Benjamin Donahue is charged with the crime. According to a report, Donahue spanked the boy because he lied about a bad grade. The incident happened between February 27th and 28th in Milton, Florida.

According to a report, a Pensacola woman allowed her children to stay with Donahue in Santa Rosa County, because she had to go out of town for work.

When the 9-year-old returned to school at Creative Learning Academy, they called the Department of Children and Families (DCF) to report the bruises found on the kid’s body. The 9-year-old was taken to Gulf Coast Kids House for evaluation.

According to the report, the 9-year-old said it was the ‘worst spanking he’d received from Donahue.

He told authorities he was beaten with a bamboo stick until it split in half, the report states.

He also told investigators 29-year-old Donahue would make him do sit-ups and burpees as a form of punishment for 5 hours, a report states.

The Pensacola woman also confirmed in an interview she would make him exercise until he was exhausted as well, the report reveals.

According to the report, the kid was punished often, Donahue told investigators, because he was spoiled and needed to “act right”.

Donahue was arrested for felony cruelty towards a child/aggravated child abuse charges.

1431,Student arrested after fight caught on camera at Broward County school,"LAUDERDALE LAKES, Fla. - Parents are outraged after a brawl was captured on cellphone video at Boyd Anderson High School in Lauderdale Lakes. Some parents said too many students are slugging it out and no one is learning anything.

The first punches were thrown in the courtyard of the school right as classes started for the day.

""People were just going crazy about it,"" one student, identified only as Elijah, said.

The video shows dozens and dozens of students standing by. Parent Kimberly Graham said what angers her the most is that staff members do not appear to quickly intervene.

""My son got jumped,"" she said. ""He's being kicked all in the head and everything -- jumped on by several students. Where was the security guard when all of this was going on?""

The video shows Graham’s 14-year-old son, who was wearing a white T-shirt, surrounded by a mob of students.

""It didn't involve my son at first, no,"" Graham said. ""It was two little girls that were fighting at first. Another boy got into it and some kind of way my son wound up in it.""

Graham said her son was arrested after the fight.

The incident was one of a series of fights on campus Thursday that have been making the rounds on social media.

""It's kids. Kids gonna always fight over stupid things sometimes,"" Elijah said.

The Broward Sheriff's Office confirmed that deputies were called out to the school to help contain the situation.

In another altercation caught on camera, two girls appear to fight each other as another student records the drama.

A man, believed to be a school employee, is seen breaking apart the pair.

An adult also eventually intervened in the fight involving Graham's son.

But the drama ended with her son in custody, even though she maintains he was not the instigator.

""You send your child to school, you think there's adult figures around that's supposed to be protecting your child,"" she said. ""(There) should be security everywhere and (there's) not.""

Surveillance video and police reports show Guertin grabbed the boy from behind and dropped him on a cafeteria bench. She then reportedly hit the child five times and dragged him to a door by his right arm, where he was handed to other staff members.

School board member Rob Hyatt responded to the two, telling them to address their concerns to the district’s assistant superintendent of human resources, Kevin Purvis, at a later time.

“We definitely felt they brushed us off,” Wade said. “I don’t think they’re going to do anything.”

Wade said she intends to meet with district human resources, but remains skeptical.

She said she also intends to meet with the State Attorney’s Office again at a future date. The office dropped charges against Guertin, citing a Florida law that allows teachers to serve in the place of parents in times of discipline.

About 10 people protested outside the district administration building before the meeting, carrying signs that read “Investigate Karen Clarke,” the schools superintendent, and “Protect All Children.” They lined up along East University Avenue to hold their signs before gathering inside.

Later during the meeting, in other business, the board selected two people to oversee funds raised from the half-cent sales tax.

Tom Mason and Shane Johnson were named the two individuals to represent the oversight committee.

Mason has worked as an academic advisor at Santa Fe College for 15 years. He recently worked as a representative of the School Planning Advisory Committee.

In addition to serving as an executive officer in the Association of Florida Colleges and a board director for Fightin' Gator Touchdown Club for 16 years, he was also recently part of the School Planning Advisory Committee.

Johnson is the executive director of the county’s Boys & Girls Club. His application to lead the half-cent tax committee says he has been a general manager of restaurants for more than 15 years, and a church financial committee member for 10.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190305/parents-protest-handling-of-boy-3-by-teacher?rssfeed=true,2019-03-05T19:28:31Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
1439,"Bonita man accused of child neglect, bribery after 6-year-old found wandering outside","CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

A Bonita Springs man was arrested Saturday and charged with child neglect and bribery after his 6-year-old son was found wandering around alone outside near Riverside Park, according to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office.

Salvatore Gualim Lem, 35, offered deputies $100 to let him go after he was taken to the Sheriff's Office headquarters for questioning, deputies said.

A woman driving by found the child near the park on Front Street in Bonita Springs and asked him where his parents were.

The boy replied that his mom was in Guatemala and his dad had left the house where they lived, according to an arrest report from the Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies identified the boy and stayed with him for more than an hour before he told them where he lived on Kentucky Street in Bonita Springs, according to the Sheriff’s Office.

A resident returned to the home after about an hour and provided Lem's phone number to the deputies, according to the Sheriff’s Office.

When deputies contacted Lem he refused to return home or give his whereabouts. Deputies made several phone calls and checks of the area, and Lem returned home about 30 minutes later and appeared drunk, according to the Sheriff’s Office.

Lem told deputies he went grocery shopping and had one grocery bag with Ramen noodles in it, according to his arrest report.

The child involved in the incident was taken into custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families, according to the sheriff’s office.

Battalion Chief Jason Cook says the boy was wearing a sock on his hand when he reached through the chain-link fence from his family’s backyard toward two huskies living next door.

""He lost his hand from about this point down,"" Cook told Fox 13, while pointing above his own wrist.

The boy's family tried to limit the bleeding until emergency workers arrived.

Cook said the child’s hand has not been found and “may have been ingested by the dog.”

1442,Special ed teacher accused of sexually assaulting 13-year-old boy 100-plus times,"CLOSE Goodyear, Ariz. teacher Brittany Zamora, 27, was arrested for sexual misconduct with a 13-year-old boy in her class. She has pleaded not guilty. USA TODAY

A former Alpena, Michigan, Public Schools special education teacher who is accused of repeatedly having sex with one of her students has been ordered to stand trial after a three-day preliminary examination, according to the Alpena News.

Heather Winfield, 38, who taught at Thunder Bay Junior High, is charged with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a child younger than 13 years old and individual counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct during the commission of a felony, third-degree criminal sexual conduct with a child aged 13 to 15 years old, second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a child younger than 13 years old, accosting a minor for immoral purposes, and using a computer to commit a crime.

If convicted, Winfield could face life in prison.

On Friday, witnesses and law enforcement took to the stand, including the now 14-year-old student, the newspaper reported. He testified the relationship started when he was 11, and that he and Winfield had sex more than 100 times in several hotel rooms in Alpena.

The defense told Judge Thomas LaCross that the case should be thrown out due to the low amount of physical evidence and the boy's lack of credibility. The teenager claimed he and Winfield had had sex with other people around and had told police that they had intercourse ""maybe 1,000 times,"" but later changed it 100.

Winfield's case is one in a string of cases in Michigan and across the nation where a teacher was accused of engaging in sexual acts with a student.

In January, a former Rochester teacher was charged with six counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct in January. Kathryn Houghtaling, a 26-year-old special education teacher at Rochester High School, was accused of engaging in sexual acts with two underage students.

And in Arizona, a 28-year-old elementary school teacher is accused of having sex with her 13-year-old student, including in the classroom in front of another male student.

Brittany Zamora, a teacher at Las Brisas Academy elementary school in Goodyear, Arizona, was arrested in March 2018 on suspicion of sexual misconduct after a monitoring app on the boy's cellphone alerted his parents to illicit texts between the two.

1446,Florida family raising gender-neutral 'theyby',"A Florida family decided that they are raising a gender-neutral baby, or rather ""theyby.""

According to WTSP, Ari Dennis as a ""theyby."" Instead of ""boy"" or ""girl"", gender neutral babies are known as ""theybies"". ""Theybies"" refer to babies without a known sex. This parenting philosophy means only the parents and trusted caregivers know the baby's anatomy. They believe the gender part comes later and is left up to the child.

""We did not assign a sex at birth, which means when they were born, they had genitals, we know what they are, we just chose to acknowledge that those genitals don't indicate anything about gender,"" Dennis said.

1447,Florida woman charged with murder in 32-year-old disappearance of 3-year-old son,"0 Florida woman charged with murder in 32-year-old disappearance of 3-year-old son

NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. -

A Florida woman has been arrested in the decades-old disappearance of her 3-year-old son, who is believed to have been murdered, police said.

Amy Elizabeth Fleming, 60, of Dania Beach, was arrested Jan. 29 in Boca Raton on an out-of-state fugitive warrant from North Las Vegas, according to Palm Beach County court records. She is charged with felony murder.

KSNV in Las Vegas reported that Fleming is charged with the 1986 homicide of her 3-year-old son, Francillon Pierre, who was known by the nickname “Yo-yo.” Fleming waived extradition Feb. 1 and, as of Monday, was in the process of being extradited to Clark County, Nevada.

The Associated Press reported Monday that the boy’s body has not been found, but investigators have obtained new statements from witnesses who allege that Fleming killed her son. North Las Vegas police officials have declined to say how they believe Francillon died.

“The parents have always been persons of interests in the case,” North Las Vegas police Officer Eric Leavitt said Monday, according to the AP. “At this point, evidence points to (Fleming), but the investigation is ongoing.”

Police officials told KSNV Saturday that cold case detectives have been working on Francillon’s disappearance over the past several months and “pieced several things together.”

According to the Charley Project, an organization that profiles about 10,000 missing persons cases in the U.S., Fleming, who in 1986 went by the name Amy Luster, told police her son vanished Aug. 2, 1986, from the Broad Acres Swap Meet in North Las Vegas. At the time of his disappearance, Francillon lived with a then-28-year-old Amy Luster and her fiancé, Lee Luster.

Lee Luster, the other person of interest in the case, has not been charged in connection with the boy’s death, the AP reported.

Francillon’s biological father, Jean Pierre, was Amy Luster’s former boyfriend, the Charley Project said.

When the toddler vanished, Amy and Lee Luster were awaiting trial on felony child abuse charges stemming from a December 1985 case in which Francillon was found to have 30 to 40 welts on his 32-pound body, the Charley Project reported.

The Associated Press reported the couple eventually pleaded guilty to the abuse charges and each served five years of probation.

“Amy and Lee told the police they’d taken the boy to the swap meet and lost track of him there,” the Charley Project page for Francillon read. “They asked authorities not to publicize his disappearance or distribute photographs because they didn’t want the media to sensationalize it.”

About a month later, the couple tried to sell some of the boy’s toys in a garage sale to help pay for a trip they planned to Seattle, the website said. The garage sale was canceled after local media reported about it.

George Knapp, a reporter with 8 News Now in Las Vegas, recalled the story of the missing boy with the beautiful smile.

“It grabbed the public and it didn’t let go for months,” Knapp said in an 8 News Now story posted online Monday. “Francillon’s face was everywhere, that one photo, that face, the innocence of that smiling, 3-year-old face.”

The Charley Project reported Amy and Lee Luster blamed Francillon’s disappearance on his biological father, who lived in Haiti when his son vanished.

“Investigators located him in Haiti about two and a half months later and searched his apartment but found no trace of Francillon,” the website said. “Jean then traveled to Nevada, took a lie detector test and passed. He was ruled out as a suspect.”

The Lusters were considered suspects in Francillon’s disappearance but were never charged, the Charley Project said on the boy’s page, which was last updated in 2012. The couple married and moved to Boca Raton about 11 months after the boy went missing, claiming they did so to be closer to Haiti.

They said they still believed Pierre had abducted his son.

Knapp said police -- and the public -- were skeptical of the Lusters’ story from the start.

“The suspicion was that they had taken their anger out on him one last time and it went too far,” Knapp said.

1448,Florida woman arrested on charge she murdered her child 33 years ago,"The woman had insisted her 3-year-old vanished from a Las Vegas-area swap meet.

WEST PALM BEACH — One minute, Amy Luster insisted, her baby was with her at a Nevada swap meet. The next, Yo-Yo was gone.

Now Luster — listed as Amy Elizabeth Fleming — is in custody in Palm Beach County, charged with the murder of her 3-year-old son Francillon Pierre.

More than 32 years ago.

Fleming, 60, of Dania Beach in Broward County, was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail on Jan. 29 for the 1986 murder, jail records show. She had a first appearance Feb. 1 and agreed not to fight extradition to Nevada. She has another hearing Monday.

According to Nevada news stories from 1986, as well as the Charley Project, an Indiana-based database that aggregates news and police reports on missing children, Francillon Pierre still officially is listed as missing, and his face, as well as an artist's ""progression"" of how he would look as an adult, are posted on various missing-children pages.

Court records in Nevada and Florida show the arrest warrant for Fleming was issued in North Las Vegas last Dec. 13, showing a bond of $1 million.

The Palm Beach Post was unable to learn Friday how authorities were able to break the case, how they were led to Fleming, or how the Broward resident came to be booked in Palm Beach County.

Boca Raton police are listed as the arresting agency, but a spokesman said the arrest was done by U.S. Marshals, who did not say how they apprehended her.

The Clark County, Nevada, District Attorney in Las Vegas said Friday it had a brief charging document listing only Fleming, the date of the murder, and the name of the victim.

Voicemails left with both the public information office and the detective bureau of the North Las Vegas police department were not returned; the city hall was closed Friday. Calls to the North Las Vegas Township Justice Court were not returned, and a docket entry showed the open 1986 murder charge but copies of charging documents or police reports were not posted online.

North Las Vegas police told local TV station KSNV on Saturday that they plan a Monday afternoon news conference to release some more detail. They said that their detectives have been working the cold case for 12 to 18 months and found enough to merit the arrest.

Francillon, nicknamed Yo-Yo, last was seen at the Broad Acres Swap Meet in North Las Vegas on Aug. 2, 1986. Amy and the boy's stepfather, Lee Luster, told police they had taken the boy to the swap meet and lost track of him.

They reportedly asked authorities not to publicize Francillon's disappearance or distribute photographs because, they said, they feared the press would sensationalize it. But almost right away, the two were suspected of foul play.

The Lusters had been charged with felony child abuse in December 1985 after they allegedly beat Francillon, resulting in 30 to 40 welts on his body. They were awaiting trial in that case when the boy disappeared. The two eventually pleaded no contest to the prior child abuse charge and were placed on five years' probation.

A month after reporting Francillon's disappearance, the two attempted to sell some of his toys at a garage sale to finance a trip to Seattle but canceled it after news reports surfaced about the sale.

In December 1986, Lee and Amy were charged with perjury after they allegedly lied about their backgrounds and where they had lived and worked. The disposition of the separate perjury charges could not be learned Friday.

The Lusters at one point suggested Jean Pierre, Amy's former boyfriend and Yo-Yo's biological father, had something to do with the child's disappearance. Investigators found Jean Pierre in Haiti about two and a half months after that. They searched his apartment, but found no trace of Yo-Yo. Jean then traveled to Nevada, took a lie detector test and passed and was ruled out as a suspect.

About 11 months after Francillon disappeared, Amy and Lee traveled to Orlando. A July 4, 1987 Orlando Sentinel story said the couple was trying to escape the intense scrutiny that followed them, and the two still believed the child had been taken by his father, Jean Pierre. The Lusters said moving to Florida would put them closer to Haiti, where they believed the child was. With no formal charges against the couple, the Nevada Department of Probation and Parole gave them a 30-day travel pass to try to find work and a home in Orlando or else return to Nevada.

It's not known how long the couple stayed in Central Florida, or when or why Luster came to South Florida. A 2009 IRS lien for $46,000, for unpaid business taxes from 2005 to 2008, shows Amy E. Fleming Luster and Mahaleel ""Lee"" Luster living in Sunny Isles Beach in Miami-Dade County. Except for the extradition case, Fleming/Luster does not appear in Palm Beach County Court records.

A call Friday to a phone number listed for Fleming in the Palm Beach County extradition case went to her voicemail and was not returned. Nor were calls Friday to South Florida phone numbers listed for Lee Luster and relatives.

1454,Spate of dog attacks raise concerns,"Dog bites are fairly common in Alachua County, but the severity of the attacks in a series of recent maulings, including the death of a toddler Friday, is unprecedented — at least in recent decades.

Starting with Bella and her owner Linda Swinburn in September, the attacks have killed one person, injured four people, and killed three dogs and a cat.

In another case, a boy riding his bike in northwest Gainesville was injured when a dog got out of its house down the street, attacking him and killing a cat.

The attacking dogs in all of the cases have or will be euthanized by Alachua County Animal Services. Until Friday’s case, all of the recent attacks have occurred when dogs got loose from their property.

Some procedures were changed after Bella’s case to provide improved response and investigation of dog attacks but the Feb. 26 mauling at Palmetto Villas that left Lorraine Anderson with a severed ear, among other wounds, and her chihuahua Tico dead, shows that gaps exist.

The dogs that attacked her had gotten loose from their yard the day before and threatened a woman in the complex’s laundry room. She grabbed a pole in case they went for her, but the dogs ran off.

A Gainesville Police officer went to the house, saw that a table was covering a hole in the wooden fence and left without reporting the incident to Alachua County Animal Services.

“What could be different is the way we train people to think about pets. This officer who had gone to the house...the (owner) needs to know that a 100-pound dog could move that little card table,” Anderson said. “To think that (the attack) could have been prevented, God, I am a mess. I am going to have a lot of problems in the future because of this.”

Meanwhile, Swinburn said she plans to push the adoption a version of “Fabian’s Law,” legislation in Arizona named in honor of a mauled dog that carries greater penalties for owners who dogs get loose and attack other animals or people.

For instance, the owner of a dog that has a history of biting or is likely to endanger others faces a felony if an attack happens while the dog is at large. A person who does not take reasonable care to keep a dog from escaping faces a misdemeanor charge.

Nathaniel Pettiford, the owner of the dogs that attacked Swinburn and Bella, has been charged with animal cruelty and culpable negligence. Animal cruelty is a third-degree felony and culpable negligence is a first-degree misdemeanor.

“I want to have the same law passed for Bella,” Swinburn said in an email. “There are too many attacks in Gainesville and surrounding cities (that) nobody is taking responsibility for.

The owners are getting away with this and the laws need to be more strict. I will take this to the legislature and state capitol for Justice For BELLA and the others who have suffered these devastating attacks!”

Alachua County commissioners and Animal Services have made changes since the Bella case to improve responses by animal officers to aggressive dog calls on weekends.

Now, GPD is considering a protocol in which the Combined Communications Center, which dispatches for the county and for GPD, to automatically notify an on-call animal services officer when it notifies GPD of an aggressive dog case, said GPD Inspector Jorge Campos.

Under current procedures, the telecommunicator asks a series of questions of people reporting aggressive dogs. The first is whether the dog is actively aggressive and endangering people.

If the dog is actively aggressive or endangering, the call is graded as a Priority 2 on the scale of 1 to 7 and law enforcement will respond quickly. If the dog is not actively aggressive or endangering, the call goes to Animal Services without law enforcement responding.

Campos said if Animal Services officers are notified for Priority 2 calls along with law enforcement, the response can be more effective.

“Right now the on-call person doesn’t come out unless we call them and say ‘You need to come out,” Campos said. “I believe we are going to ask the the communications center that if someone reports an aggressive dog, that animal control gets notified at the same time or shortly thereafter. Then animal control can at least start tracking those calls.”

Dog bites are not unusual in Alachua County — hundreds are reported to the Alachua County Health Department every year. The reports are compiled by year, but details of the circumstances of each case are not put into a database that could be queried for specifics about the case.

However, a sampling of individual reports show that many of the bites occur in the dog owner’s home or property. The victims are typically a family member or guest, and a number of the reports explain that the bite happened during play.

So in that regard, Friday’s case is more typical but the outcome was not. The worst mauling previous to Friday’s also occurred in the victim’s home. In May 2000 a 20-month-old Grove Park boy ran up to the family’s 55-pound red brindle pit bull that was chained in the yard and was attacked. The toddler had multiple bites on his head and neck.

Dog aggression is complex and can be found in canines of all breeds, ages and genders, said Terry Curtis, a clinical behaviorist with the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine.

Whether a dog with aggressive tendencies acts on them depends on the circumstances.

“If a dog has been inside the house or in the yard for a period of time, watching people going by, that can be very threatening to the dog. So the dog gets out and it is ready to go after what it perceives as a threat,” Curtis said. “Most dogs are not attacking out of the blue. There is either a threat component to it... or a predatory component to it. It is not going to be a dominance thing — there is no dominance from dogs to people.”

Predatory action — chasing everything that goes by — is different than acting on a perceived threat. Curtis said some dogs are hard-wired toward predatory behavior.

Pepe Peruyero is a former GPD dog handler who created J&K Canine Academy after seeing stacks of euthanized dogs on the Animal Services shelter loading dock. Many of the dogs had been relinquished because of bad behavior.

Euthanasia has since dropped dramatically at Animal Services because of increased adoptions in coordination with local rescue organizations.

A direct correlation exists between a dog’s and how it perceives behavior that is either acceptable, situational or impulsive, Peruyero said.

“If I encourage my dog to bark at dogs when they go by, if my dog lives in a yard that is constantly taunted by kids, if my dog is tied up on a chain or a line and is lunging all day long — the likelihood of that dog building up that aggression is greater,” Peruyero said. “If you want to have a dog, whether it’s a two-pound Yorkie or a bull mastiff, you need to care for that dog. There is a responsibility. Shade, shelter, food and water is not enough. The dog should live in an environment that is conducive to its well-being.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190308/spate-of-dog-attacks-raise-concerns?rssfeed=true,2019-03-08T20:18:39Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608

Storytelling has been part of the human experience since we first huddled around a fire to eat whatever beast we'd killed that day with our spears. If we fast forward to modern day, it's always been a part of the American South, too. That's not to say storytelling's not important everywhere, but I can only speak for here. It's part of our history, our education and our love for those closest to us.

Stories aren't even always spoken here. For instance, I grew up listening to stories in song. From Kenny Rogers' ""The Gambler,"" to Johnny Cash's ""A Boy Named Sue,"" my father and I shared a love for story songs, because it was always entertainment times two. One of our very favorite singer/songwriters was Tom T. Hall, also known as ""The Storyteller."" Is Hall's presence in this column a coincidence? I think not.

► After so many wrongs, are right whales finally catching a break?

► Did Knights of the Golden Circle bury treasures in the South?

Hall was hot in those days. He wrote and sang seven No. 1 hits, but he also wrote hits for other artists. He's most well known in that regard for helping Jeannie C. Riley gain fame with ""Harper Valley P.T.A."" Those lyrics scream, ""A natural-born storyteller wrote us!""

As a kid, my favorite song of Hall's own was ""Who's Gonna Feed Them Hogs?"" Like the pig farmer stuck in that danged bed, I worried about them hogs. His wife couldn't feed 'em and his neighbors didn't care. They couldn't get out and roam around like his old hunting dogs. It was a whole situation in my 10-year-old brain.

The future writer in me wanted to know what happened after the song ended. The pig farmer left against medical advice. Did he go home, feed his pigs and all was well? Or did he maybe drop dead in the pen, get trampled and finally get eaten because the pigs were still hungry? Yes, that's where 10-year-old brains go when they're left to wander on their own.

Now for Dad, I don't know if ""(Old Dogs, Children and) Watermelon Wine"" was his very favorite of Hall's songs, but I know he sure loved it. I've always liked it a lot, but as I get older, I appreciate it even more. It gets to the heart of what's important in life and why, as explained to a songwriter by an airport janitor. To that character, there were only three things in life worth a solitary dime. You got it — old dogs, children and watermelon wine.

My father passed away three years ago, and when I want to think about him, I listen to a song by ""The Storyteller."" Not only did we share Hall's tunes, we shared his characters and their worlds. That was our story. Everybody has one, so what's yours?

1457,Special needs students face lengthy bus rides from Destin to FWB,"DESTIN — Ron Smithey wakes up his 10-year-old son before daylight on school days to prepare him for a nearly 1½ hour trek to school. That’s because his son, who is autistic, cannot attend school in their hometown of Destin and therefore is bused to the neighboring city of Fort Walton Beach each day.

What would normally be a 30-minute drive actually averages 73 minutes for Smithey's son and the other 12 special needs children who ride the Destin-to-Fort Walton Beach bus, according to information provided by the Okaloosa County School District.

“He has to be on the bus at 6:30 in the morning and school doesn’t even start until 8:15,” Smithey said. “The kids right across the street don’t even get on the bus until 8, so I think it’s discrimination. He is losing several hours a day while he is locked on a bus. We just can’t seem to get a break.”

Assistant Superintendent for the Okaloosa County School District, Steve Horton said the door-to-door student pick-up procedure is the main factor in elongated travel time. Besides the bus driver, a trained aid also rides the bus with the children in order to help address and de-escalate issues, should they arise during the bus route.

""That drive time is a byproduct of picking up each student at their door,"" Horton said. ""We work with our transportation department to do the best we can to minimize those drive times. It’s always a concern to us. It’s just a matter of trying to find the best way to keep those drive times minimized.""

Smithey said that his now fifth-grade son attended a special needs prekindergarten (Pre-KD) at Destin Elementary School when he was 3 years old. When he aged out, his parents were told there was no accommodating class for their son in Destin. The option the School District gave the family was to enroll their son in Edwin’s Elementary School in Fort Walton Beach, Smithey said.

Just down the street from Smithey lives another autistic boy, 10-year-old Landon Blasbichler. He too rides the bus, and is the last stop on the route which means he rides the bus the longest. Landon's father, Jeff, said he and Smithey have known each other since their sons were in prekindergarten together, and he is also an advocate for shorter bus times for their kids.



Blasbichler said that to try to cut down on Landon's daily travel time, he takes his fourth-grader to school every morning, but since he cannot make it to Fort Walton Beach early enough for pick-up, his son returns home to Destin on the bus.

“He sleeps on the ride home, which makes it hard for him to go to bed at night and that just (creates) problems the next day because he might be groggy or sleepy,” Blasbichler said. “I actually take him in the morning, because the bus ride would be two hours and it’s too much for a special needs kid to be on the bus that long.”

Horton said that the ESE department reviews enrollment numbers each year in order to determine the need for new self-contained classrooms, but as it stands in Destin, there are not enough special needs students to garner a new classroom.

“Including students who are driven to school by their parents, we typically have had only three students in any one grade band (K-2, 3-5 and 6-8) with the same special needs that would be in a class together,” Horton said. “Generally 10 students is what we look at as a guideline when opening a new class.”

Horton added that 10 years ago, the need for a pre-KD class in Destin was great enough to create one classroom and a few years ago that grew to two. Midway through this school year (2018-2019), that need grew again, so today, Destin Elementary School has three pre-KD classrooms.

""There are three pre-KD classes at the elementary school in Destin currently, but not all of the students in a given pre-KD class will need to be transported into a self-contained classroom somewhere else,"" Horton said. ""We are always monitoring that as well.""

As for the bus times, Horton said that there is no maximum time set by the School District that limits a student’s bus travel time. Concerns for children needing to use the bathroom during the ride have arisen due to the long bus route. However, Horton stated that for the safety of the students, buses are not permitted to make an unapproved stop.

Horton did say the School District is willing to work on solutions on the travel-time issue going forward. One suggestion would be to hire a second driver and have two buses routed from Destin to Fort Walton Beach, but Horton said the necessary staff may not be available.

""That is something we always look to consider,"" Horton said. ""I think we will be able to look at the transportation department to see if it is feasible with the budgetary restrictions we have. I am never opposed to looking at options that can improve the educational experience for our students.""

Today, Smithey said that although he had almost given up the fight for a special needs class in Destin, with the new spotlight on Exceptional Student Education (ESE) students in Okaloosa County, he just wants to have his voice heard. He added that he fears the bus ride situation will relive itself in his life, as his second son, who is 3 years old, may also be diagnosed with autism.

“It’s about to happen again,"" he said. ""With all of the attention on the School District and special needs students right now, we were hoping that it would gain some attention that these kids are being discriminated against by our School District and we are powerless to stop it.”

But for their part, Horton said the School District is committed to working with ESE parents to address possible solutions.

""This spring we will look at those pre-KD classes and determine the need for a class,"" Horton said. ""That is what I am committed to doing, and it is something we will be doing moving forward.""",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190308/special-needs-students-face-lengthy-bus-rides-from-destin-to-fwb?rssfeed=true,2019-03-08T12:31:27Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
1458,Pensacola Little Theatre to perform classic Velveteen Rabbit,"The story of Velveteen Rabbit has stood the test of time for almost a century as an essential read in children’s literature.

The classic book written by Margery Williams, first published in 1922, is coming to the Pensacola Little Theatre stage as part of its Treehouse series. The play takes the audience through the Velveteen Rabbit’s journey to become real and alive, and the character learns how to love in the process.

Director Jay Bixler said that there are a few aspects of “Velveteen Rabbit” that modern audiences might find old-fashioned, but the story itself is timeless.

“It’s actually very similar to a story modern movie-going audiences have come to recognize and love – Disney’s ‘Toy Story,’” said Bixler. “Just like in that story, the toys in our play come to life when people aren’t around. However, unlike Buzz Lightyear, these toys are very aware of what they are and understand enough of their reality to desire becoming ‘real.’”

Bixler said that while the story has its imaginative side, it also deals with deeper themes that audiences of all ages can grasp. The play has its main character coming to terms with growing up, disappointment, loss and even death.

“There is the somewhat darker theme in the story of children learning about death and the concept of loss,” he said. “It can be a difficult thing to grasp for young minds, and stories like ‘Velveteen Rabbit’ can help them understand the inevitability and reality of it.”

Bixler is also the Education Director for Pensacola Little Theatre and said that there are some new faces performing in the production as well as several returning players.

“I didn’t know it at the time, but the actor we cast as the doctor had played another character in a previous iteration of the Velveteen Rabbit at PLT 20 years ago,” he mentioned.

Another returning actor is Nathan Toepfer who plays the Velveteen Rabbit. Toepfer has performed with the theatre for almost 10 years and has been in many shows from the family-friendly “Sound of Music” to the more adult-oriented “Rocky Horror Show.”

He said understanding his role as the stuffed animal that comes to life isn’t entirely new to him. “I had heard the story many times when I was little and actually remember seeing the production of ‘Velveteen Rabbit’ at PLT back in 1999,” Toepfer said. “I always had many stuffed toys with various personalities and they have all been quite real to me. I know how important a cherished toy can be to a child no matter how worn it can seem to the rest of the world.”

Bringing the character of the rabbit to life relies on Toepfer’s acting rather than a costume.

“Melissa Kegley, our costumer, has been working with actual prop toys such as the Velveteen Rabbit to create the ‘spirit’ of each toy with human characteristics,” he said. “I am not in a rabbit suit, but have a velveteen jacket and similar colors to the toy rabbit.”

Toepfer explained that his character is a very curious and innocent character with a sense of wonder and child-like desire.

“From the moment the Velveteen Rabbit is brought to life, he’s told that he’s different from the other toys,” he said. “He is only velveteen and stuffed with sawdust but his owner, Alex, loves him regardless. Even as the Velveteen Rabbit gets tattered and worn, he becomes ‘real’ to the boy and can talk and play with him, and over the course of the play, he learns what it means to love.”

Because of his previous experience with Pensacola Little Theatre, Toepfer has reunited with many people he has worked with before, as well as some new players.

“I love that some of my younger castmates get to play the fatherly figures for me,” he said. “It is great to see them through the eyes of a child and to grow on stage together.”

Toepfer said the show has all of the fun of an animated movie with a gentle message that adults will also appreciate. He hopes everyone will see what it means to love from a child’s eyes and heart. “Adults and children will experience a love in its purest form,” he said.

Bixler added that as director of “Velveteen Rabbit,” combined with his position as the theater’s education director and expanding the program, is a great deal of work. “Our education program is different from an acting school or classes you might encounter,” he said. “We are primarily a community theatre, so our classes are open to the public and provide a ‘coaching’ atmosphere for acting instruction.”

He said theatre is the method that is taught in the program, but it is not the end goal.

“I’m not trying to train the next big Broadway or Hollywood star, although plenty of our former volunteers have gone on to careers in the entertainment industry,” he said. “What we strive for is to provide our students with a creative outlet, help them build communication skills and confidence, and show them the benefits of collaborative teamwork and how groups can work together to solve problems.”

“Velveteen Rabbit” has a run time of one hour and 30 minutes, including intermission.

“It’s relatively short for a play on the mainstage, so it won’t take up your whole evening,” Bixler said. “You’ll even be able to get the kids home in time for bed!”

Tickets are available online at PensacolaLittleTheatre.com and through the Box Office at 850-432-2042 or by visiting from noon – 5 p.m weekdays.

1459,Crossroads Tavern in Bunnell serves up support for families with medical needs,"BUNNELL, Fla. - Janice Bontempo, owner of the Crossroads Tavern in Bunnell, is this week's Getting Results Award winner.

Step into the Crossroads Tavern and you're instantly welcome. It's the kind of place where a seat at the bar comes with the understanding that you're family. Bontempo, who has owned the tavern for a year, sees the business as an extension of herself.

""We're a community where we all try to help each other out,"" she said. ""That's what we're about. We're about having fun, doing different things but, most of all we're about family.""

Regular David O'Brien agrees.

""It's like Cheers. Everybody knows everyone's name in here,"" he said.

Bontempo was working one evening when she noticed some new faces. Marsha Shaon and Kimberly Lewis were there with their family to celebrate a birthday. The three struck up a conversation and Lewis revealed that she had hurt her leg while trying to care for her 14-year-old nephew Colby, who has cerebal palsy.

""She told me she fell trying to carry him,"" Bontempo said. ""She told me how they just bought this trailer and somebody stole their water system and oven, all that stuff. That was the money they were going to use to build a ramp.""

Bontempo made a call to her friends in the Punishers Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club of Flagler. The group calls the tavern its hangout and agreed to help build them a ramp.

""Janice told us about it and we said we'll help out,"" club secretary David O'Brien said. ""We got all the guys together and went to work.""

O'Brien said about 25 members helped complete the project in a weekend. ""Our motto is 'in service to others,"" he said. ""And that's what we do.""

""I was overwhelmed,"" Shaon said. ""Tears of joy, pure gratitude in my heart for people I don't even know."" She said she's now a supporter of the Punishers.

""It's an amazing group of men that are willing to give back to the community,"" Bontempo said.

""I know the struggles,"" she said. ""When people come to me I know the struggles medically when you're struggling financially and trying to get things done.""

Bontempo's granddaughter has had a number of health problems including two organ transplants. She makes regular trips to Miami for her treatments. ""I've done it,"" she says. ""Emotionally, financially you get drained. How do you do that? You need help.""

Bontempo reflects on the busy weekend with pride.

""It's the most amazing feeling in the world. To watch this little boy and his grandmother just be so happy and their struggles are now gone. It's going to be easy for her and that's amazing.""

""I want to give,"" Bontempo said. ""Yes, everyone wants to make money but there are people out there that are struggling with real struggles. We want to give back to them.""

Bontempo is in the process of starting a nonprofit, Grace Flagler, to help more people in the community. You can find more information on her Facebook page.

Bontempo says half of the profits from the tavern's pool table and jukebox, as well as a portion of overall sales, will go to the charity.

State legislators continue to insist that they, not local officials, know what’s best for local communities.

Last week, Senate Bill 588 cleared a key Senate committee; the measure would place a five-year moratorium on local laws that seek to ban plastic straws, or sunscreen that harms coral reefs, while state officials study the issue.

While several environmental groups are pushing for bans on straws and some sunscreen, SB 588 sponsor Travis Hutson, a St. Augustine Republican, said he is “not a fan of government on the state or local level telling a business what to do,” and favors voluntary action by businesses.

Boy, good thing we have big government to protect us from ... big government.

The key issue here is not whether bans are good or bad — it’s that local communities should have the right to decide for themselves.

When the Florida Legislature convenes Tuesday to open the 60-day 2019 session, they’ll have weighty matters to consider.

Water quality, school safety and funding for health care will all be on the table.

With so much to do in such a short period, you might think the Legislature would have time for nothing else.

Think again.

In all, more than 3,000 bills have been filed in the Florida House and Senate. Not all of them will be taken up and relatively few will become law.

BROOKSVILLE, Fla. (WFLA) - A 14-year-old Brooksville boy was arrested over the weekend for hitting his mother with an iPad when she tried to take it from him.

Hernando County deputies were called to a home on Southern Valley Loop on Sunday for the incident. When they arrived, they found the boy's mother with two ""very distinctive red bruising marks"" on her right eye, an arrest report shows.

The woman explained to deputies she was trying to discipline her 14-year-old son by taking his iPad away and ""lightly tapped his head,"" asking him to hand it over. According to the arrest report, the boy refused, became enraged and threw the iPad at his mom, hitting her in the right eye.

Responding deputies say the boy showed ""no remorse and no respect toward law enforcement"" and noted that he started using profane language when they spoke to him. When they asked him what happened, the arrest report shows he stated, ""well she hit me first.""

After the boy was taken into custody, his mother went back into the house to check for damage. She then found the boy had cut her $1,500 Louis Vuitton purse into several pieces, according to the arrest report.

Here on the Space Coast we’ll soon be launching some incredible female astronauts for the first time since 2011. But before commercial spaceflight with astronauts happens later this year, learn about the fearless female space explorers on International Women’s Day.

There is a reason NASA has embraced the term crewed instead of manned when talking about human spaceflight, because since 2013 the space agency has had equal parts female and male astronaut classes.

There are more inspiring women than can fit into one article but let's meet a few, shall we?

A Virgin Galactic test pilot

Kelly Latimer is a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force and now is a test pilot for Virgin Galactic. Latimer has logged more than 6,200 hours flying 40 different aircraft, including NASA's space shuttle carrier aircraft and the agency's airborne observatory, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, known as SOFIA.

With Virgin Galactic, Latimer will fly SpaceShipTwo -- and later this year she may be responsible for piloting the space plane with the first paying astronauts on board.



“I always had this passion to be an astronaut, just from as long as I can remember that’s what I’ve wanted to do,” Latimer said.



Watch the video below to hear why Latimer became a test pilot.

Flying spaceships is just for boys? Nope. Meet our Test Pilot, Kelly Latimer. She’s spent over 6,200 hours in the air flying more than 40 different types of aircraft. What drove her to become a test pilot? #IWD2019 pic.twitter.com/9OTUReyRbA — Virgin Galactic (@virgingalactic) March 8, 2019

Russia’s only current woman cosmonaut

Russia flew the first two women in space, starting with Valentina Tereshkova in 1963. While Russia launched a woman into space years before the U.S. space program, only two women have flown for Roscosmos since 1984. The Russian space agency currently only has one female cosmonaut: Anna Kikina.

She is currently training in Star City, Russia, with other cosmonauts and astronauts but does not have a spaceflight planned right now. NASA astronaut Christina Koch recently bumped into Kikina during their training.

I’m not usually the type to fan girl. But when you bump into the one current woman cosmonaut and you’re both training in the same building, it’s hard not to. She was learning manual Soyuz docking and I was co-pilot training. Honored to share the same uniform as you, Анна Кикина! pic.twitter.com/ZhQ1ChZSVC — Christina H Koch (@Astro_Christina) October 19, 2018

Laura Seward Forczyk, the owner of Astralytical, a space consulting firm, told Ars Technica last September the current Russian culture isn’t supportive of women in “high-powered careers.”



Here’s hoping Kikina inspires more girls and women in Russia to apply for the next cosmonaut class, which is open to people over 35 years old with specific degrees in STEM fields.

The first African American woman to fly in space

In 1961, Alan Shepard was the first American to launch into space on Freedom 7. It would take more than three decades before an African American woman would visit space. That incredible human was Dr. Mae Jemison.

Jemison became the first black woman to visit the International Space Station in 1992. Now 62, she has continued to inspire people of color to pursue careers in science, technology, engineers and math fields.

Friday’s Google Doodle for International Women's Day includes a quote from Jemison, “Never be limited by other people’s limited imaginations.” According to Space.com the quote comes from Jemison's 2009 speech at the Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students.

NASA's first female astronauts to fly on Boeing's CST-Starliner

This year NASA’s commercial crew spacecraft by SpaceX and Boeing are set to launch U.S. astronauts from Cape Canaveral for the first time since 2011.



NASA announced the first nine astronauts to fly on Boeing’s CST-100 and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon last August, including veteran astronaut Suni Williams and NASA astronaut Nicole Aunapu Mann.

Williams has made two trips to the International Space Station totaling 322 days flying on both the Space Shuttle and Russian Soyuz spacecraft.

When others said you couldn't, you said ""We can do it!"" 💪

To the pioneers of space, our #Starliner teammates and @Commercial_Crew astronauts @AstroDuke and @Astro_Suni, thank you for building the future and daring to explore. #InternationalWomensDay #BalanceForBetter pic.twitter.com/PoCMim9GJJ — Boeing Space (@BoeingSpace) March 8, 2019

With more than 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft, Williams served in the U.S. Navy flying helicopters on relief and combat missions. Later, she became a test pilot and instructor. Williams was deployed when she was selected to be a NASA astronaut in 1998.

Williams told News 6 last August the gender of an astronaut or pilot shouldn't matter.

""When I was a helicopter pilot, when I did my first spacewalk, when I was living on the space station ... the helicopter doesn't know if I'm a girl or a boy,"" Williams said. ""The space station doesn't know, the spacesuit doesn't know. So why should it really matter, right?""



The first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner will be Mann's first trip to space. If an uncrewed flight slated for no earlier than April goes well that launch will happen in late summer.



Mann earned the nickname “Duke” as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps. She served on combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and as a test pilot for the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet. Mann was selected as part of the 2013 NASA astronaut class -- the first class to be equal parts men and women.

She told News 6 last August after her assignment on the Boeing Starliner she hopes the return to human spaceflight in the U.S. will empower the next generation of space explorers.



""Hopefully, it motivates them to study hard in school and think about what they want to do and think about how they want to contribute to this mission to exploring space,"" Mann said.

Astronauts working on the International Space Station have completed 213 spacewalks since 1998. However, on March 29 NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Anne McClain will become the first women to conduct a spacewalk without any men.

Canadian Space Agency flight controller Kristen Facciol announced on Twitter March 1 she will be on console while McClain and Koch conduct the first all-female spacewalk.

As a young girl, @Astro_Christina dreamed of going to space. Next week, that dream becomes a reality when she launches to the @Space_Station!

McClain has been working on the space station since December and will conduct another spacewalk with NASA astronaut Nick Hague on March 22, according to NASA.

Koch and Hague launch for the space station March 14.

1481,FWB's Emerald Coast Science Center celebrates 30 years (PHOTOS),"FORT WALTON BEACH — Emerald Coast Science Center started with “the cookbook.”

Then-President Cindy Frakes and Chairwoman Alexis Tibbetts of the Junior League of the Emerald Coast toted around a thick book of science exhibit ideas and instructions they called ""the cookbook"" to the community in the late 1980s. They asked government contractors, military groups, local organizations — anyone who would listen — to create exhibits for the Junior League’s signature project that year, a science museum.

The community responded to the volunteer organization's dream with a stash of makeshift science exhibits that opened in downtown Fort Walton Beach in 1989.

“Looking back at them, they were so rudimentary, but we were so proud of them,” Frakes said. “We had birthed this project and we were so proud of it.""

The nonprofit science museum will celebrate its 30th anniversary with a fundraiser and celebration at 6 p.m. Saturday at 31 Memorial Parkway S.W.

Focus

Frakes and Tibbetts remember the day it opened.

The gallery was a ragtag representation of science, but a symbol of the progress in science education that was still to come — not only in Fort Walton Beach but everywhere.

Frakes remembers one of the final exhibits moved into the building on opening day. It had a similar concept to the board game Operation, in which a light would turn green or red depending on whether it was a conductor of electricity.

“It had the directions written on it and it had electricity misspelled 14 times,” Frakes said with a laugh. “And we were opening in two hours, so I just got a magic marker and added an “i” to all those 14 words. We were just so tickled to have it.

“It was a great project, and it was in the science museum for years.”

The first name of the building was FOCUS, an acronym for Families of Okaloosa County Understanding Science.

It didn't last.

“Even though that pretty succinctly described our mission statement, the people in the community and visitors that came here had no idea what it was,” Frakes said. “People thought it was an eye clinic. ... That’s why it became the Emerald Coast Science Center.”

The museum arrived before STEM had its heyday in public education, Frakes said. Tibbetts, now the principal at South Walton High School, sparked the idea.

“She has a real love of science,” Frakes said. “She’s a believer in getting kids interested as young as possible. ... She wanted to get them started and see the fascination of science.”

Science centers were popular at the time, Tibbetts said. She had seen some while traveling with her husband when he was in the military.

“I have daughters, and I wanted my children to be interested in science,” Tibbetts said. “I feel like every child, no matter who they are — girl, boy — science, technology, engineering and math — are premiere.

“Our country needs kids to be mathematicians and scientists for us to stay competitive.”

‘Nano museum’

Tibbetts won’t take much credit for the museum.

Many business partners and sponsorships helped secure exhibits for the museum. The city of Fort Walton Beach rented out the first building for $1 a year, Frakes said.

“I love science, but the community is really who made it happen,” Tibbetts said. “I was just a cog in the wheel.”

Diane Fraser, the director, said the center moved to its current location in 2014.

“It was a real struggle,” Fraser said. “We didn’t have any new exhibits. The building doesn’t look like it looks now. We’ve repainted the entire interior in the past year. It’s taken a lot of pounding the pavement, talking to people, getting people to come in.”

Today, the Emerald Coast Science Center’s calendar is booked for months with school field trips. Students get to explore the gallery of science exhibits and meet the center’s family of pets that live throughout, such as guinea pigs, snakes and a hedgehog.

Fraser calls it a “nano-museum,” but beams with pride when she shares it’s one of the first three museums in the country that has a SMALLab open to the public. The SMALLab is a room where students can walk on an immersive floor projection, basically turning the floor into a large touch screen.

Fraser wants to create a culture in Fort Walton Beach in which people “absolutely have to go” to museums.

“If you think about it, in bigger cities they have amazing museums,” Fraser said. “Everyone anticipates and expects you go to the museum. How do we grow and create this culture here? We have some really interesting and neat museums, and they’re right here.”

Tibbetts said she is proud of the people who have not only sustained the Emerald Coast Science Center for the past 30 years, but also made it thrive. It’s a great place for people to learn, grow, play together and make science fun, she added.

“It’s a premier science center for a town our size,” Tibbetts said. “Mrs. Fraser, she’s an amazing director.

“We know from the research if we don’t hook kids on science by the time they’re eighth-graders, it’s hard to convince them in high school and college to become a STEM major. That’s why I want people to go visit the Science Center, so they will develop a love of learning the scientific phenomena and concepts that make our world what it is.”",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/entertainmentlife/20190307/fwbs-emerald-coast-science-center-celebrates-30-years-photos?rssfeed=true,2019-03-07T12:19:35Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

One's life is empty. One's is over. One has no life at all: His waking hours are spent keeping the others happy.

This trio, along with an interloping lover and a housekeeper with a fondness for voodoo, isn't a commercial for the American family. But there are bits of all of us in their exaggerated, and often funny, angst.

Twinges of recognition fire off like malevolent pistons, setting off explosions of family angst, jealousy and regret that we've all seen in our own family surroundings. And as with all of us, hope rises in intermittent wisps amid the siblings of ""Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike.""

It's Christopher Durang's winningest play ever (in 2013 — Tony for best play, Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play).

The Studio Players production opens Friday and brings muscle. Director Carole Fenstermacher is already a strong proponent of the playwright, knows his works well and uses his monologues in the classes she teaches. Jay Terzis (Vanya) actually was a schoolmate of Durang. (That association makes Fenstermacher take a deep breath: Living playwrights don't hesitate to fly down to Florida in the winter to see their works being done.)

""VSMS"" is both an extremely difficult and extremely rewarding play to direct, she said. Durang's humor isn't necessarily the grist of belly laughs but of out-of-the-blue moments. Among them: After Sonia wails that ""Our lives are over!"" the ever-agreeable Vanya responds pleasantly, ""Yes, I think so.""

These characters carry the same names as characters from Anton Chekhov plays because some of their situations and some of the philosophy mirrors Chekhov, although not slavishly.

""Everybody in that play had the same prob as in 'The Seagull.' They're all in love with someone who doesn't love them,"" Fenstermacher pointed out. And yet, ""If it were true Chekhov, none of that would be resolved. That makes this play all the more fun.""

Everyone also envies a trait the other has. For Masha, the glamour girl who has become an action film star, if not the Shakespearean actress she aspires to be, it's the constancy of her siblngs. For Sonia, the family's adoptee sister, it's just for a millisecond of her sister's magnetism. She muses over the years she and Vanya tended their Alzheimer-addled parents: ""My parents forgot who I was. But they always remembered you.""

A contentious weekend together for a neighborhood costume party bursts into flames. There's abundant tinder for the fire from the roving eye of Masha's boy toy lover and her decision to sell the family homestead in which Vanya and Sonia have lived their entire lives. (Just to add some Chekhovian overtones, it's set in a cherry orchard.)

But after the fire clears, there's always the possibility of new growth, in unexpected ways.

Hollis Galman, a one-time Off-Broadway actress and theatrical agent, is making her Studio Players debut in the larger-than-life role of Masha.

""I love them to pieces, ""Galman said of her character. But family can be grating. "" Sonia exhausts me no end. I have no patience for her.""

""We are sisters who may have shared a bedroom. I see pink twin beds with ruffled canopies — and fights from the get-go,"" explained Paula Keenan, who has put aside her directing skills to be onstage as Sonia.

""I'm more the peacemaker between these two. I just want things to calm down and be nice,"" Terzis said. He has the hardest job — and, eventually, the most dramatic moment — of the entire play. It's a challenge he's happy to rise to.

""I've always wanted to be part of this theater because I love the plays Scott (Lilly, artistic director) chooses,"" Terzis said. And one by his former schoolmate was irresistible.

Michelle Lodzinski was living in Florida when she was charged in 2014 after New Jersey investigators reopened the case and found witnesses who could identify a blanket found near the boy's remains as having come from her apartment.

Lodzinski had claimed in 1991 that 5-year-old Timothy Wiltsey disappeared while they were at a carnival. His body was found 11 months later.

LAYTON, UT (KUTV) - A 4-year-old child in Utah is undergoing surgery after a dog ripped off one of the child's arms after the child stuck it through a fence Sunday afternoon.

According to KUTV, the four-year-old was taken by medical helicopter to a local children's hospital in stable condition.

According to the Layton Fire Department, the child was playing in the yard before going over to a chain-linked fence which separates the backyard the child was in with the backyard two Huskies were in.

The child reached through the fence to pet the dogs when one bit the child in the mid-forearm and ripped off the lower arm with the hand.

KUTV reports crews were able to find the dog, but believe the husky may have eaten the child's arm and hand.

DENVER (AP) - The body of a 7-year-old Denver boy found in a storage unit in December showed traces of cocaine and methamphetamine in his liver.

The Denver Post reports the city’s medical examiner determined Caden McWilliams had ingested the drugs before his death.

The elementary school student likely had been dead since May when authorities found his body wrapped in plastic bags and encased in concrete inside an animal crate.

The medical examiner could not determine an exact cause of death but ruled it a homicide.

An autopsy found he was emaciated and weighed about 27 pounds with injuries to his head, torso and extremities resulting in a fractured skull and broken arm.

McWilliam’s mother Elisha Pankey faces charges of child abuse leading to death and abuse of a corpse.

1492,Florida student arrested: Civil rights complaint being filed after Pledge dispute,"11-year-old Florida boy at Lawton Chiles Middle Academy was suspended and arrested for disrupting a school function and resisting arrest without violence after refusing to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

LAKELAND — An attorney for an 11-year-old Polk County student, arrested for disrupting a school function and resisting arrest without violence after refusing to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, said he is filing a civil rights complaint with the United States Department of Education.

Roderick Ford, an attorney with the Cochran Law Firm in Tampa, said he and the student's family are also hoping the state attorney's office will not move forward with formal charges against the student because he was exercising his constitutionally protected right of free speech.

“There is an improper constitutional deprivation of rights that goes to the heart of the founding of this country,” Ford said during an interview Monday evening. “He is very proud to be an American and he was acting in the greatest tradition of being an American.”

Ford's comments stem from the arrest and suspension of the sixth-grader at Lawton Chiles Middle Academy on Feb. 4 after the student refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and was then asked to stand up by a substitute teacher, Ana Alvarez.

“I asked the student to stand up for the pledge and he answered that he won't because the flag of this country was racist,” Alvarez wrote in a statement to police. “He then started to explain why the National Anthem was offensive to black people.”

Spokesmen for the Lakeland Police Department and Polk County Public Schools stressed that the student at the magnet school for gifted students was not arrested for refusing to participate in the pledge.

“Students are not required to participate in the Pledge of Allegiance,” according to a statement from the district Monday morning.

The student's mother, Dhakira Talbot, said there was at least one other student who was also not standing and she didn't understand why her son was singled out.

“I just want people to know that my son is not a monster, he is not a disrespectful kid,” Talbot said, wiping away tears. She said her son was doing what she has taught him to do. “You standing up for yourself is not wrong.”

She said she and her son have been emotionally overwhelmed by the media attention surrounding the incident. Stories have appeared in The Washington Post, NBC Nightly News, USA Today and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, among others, regarding the incident.

“You don't know that feeling of having to raise your kids on what to do if you're stopped by police,” said Talbot, who noted she is two classes shy of a business degree from college.

Alvarez's statement shows she told the student that “Why, if it was so bad here, he did not go to another place to (live).” She explained that she moved here from Cuba and that “the day I feel I'm not welcome here anymore, I would find another place to (live).""

According to the arrest affidavit, the substitute teacher called the office to have the student removed. School Resource Officer Carlos Cortes and School Dean Michael Simpson responded and asked the student to leave the room with them.

The student “continued to yell that the teacher had told him to, 'Go back to Africa',” Cortes wrote in his report, adding that he asked the student “several times (over 20 times)” to leave. He said the student continued saying, "" 'I'm not leaving. Do your job and take her, she's the racist one who told me to go back to Africa.”

Cortes also wrote in the report that the student told the dean not to touch him and that he would call the police on him. After finally leaving the classroom, the student continued yelling in the hallway that “You're all racist.” When he entered the office he began crying and screamed, “I'm going to beat that teacher.”

The student also asked to call his mother. When he wasn't allowed, he went to the guidance office. School Principal Brian Andrews took the student by his arms, telling him to calm down, the student told him that “I'm going to get you fired. I'm going to get all of you fired.”

District officials said Alvarez will not be hired again as a substitute teacher in Polk County. They said they are reviewing their training process for substitutes.

The student was taken to a juvenile facility for evaluation, but has since been released. Talbot said she has transferred her son to a different school.

Kay Fields, the only black member of the Polk County School Board, said she is awaiting the results of an investigation.

""I just think it's unfortunate, especially over the pledge,"" Fields said Monday afternoon at Girls Inc., a nonprofit that helps underprivileged girls with homework and social skills. Fields recites the Pledge of Allegiance before each School Board meeting and said she also stands for the national anthem.

""Times are different today,"" Fields said. ""If I had a girl at Girls Inc. who didn't want to stand for the pledge, I wouldn't make a big deal of it. I might pull her aside and talk with her about it to find out why and talk with her parents about it.""
