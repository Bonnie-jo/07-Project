14,60,Family of California man killed in Tesla crash sue automaker,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The family of a software engineer who died after his Tesla SUV crashed in a Northern California highway has sued the automaker.

The lawsuit filed in a Santa Clara County says the autopilot navigation system caused the crash on Highway 101 that killed Walter Huang near Mountain View in Silicon Valley last year.

Huang’s widow, Sevonne Huang, and his family also sued the state’s Department of Transportation for not maintaining the highway.

The California Highway Patrol said Walter Huang was traveling south in the carpool lane when the Tesla crashed against a freeway barrier. The crash caused a fire. Rescuers were able to free him, but he died later at a hospital.

The family’s attorney, B. Mark Fong, said Wednesday they are suing to help prevent “this tragedy from happening to other drivers using Tesla vehicles.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A Northern California man has been sentenced to 90 days in jail after pleading guilty to killing more than 150 protected birds and other wildlife.

California Department of Fish and Wildlife officials call it the largest raptor poaching case in known California history.

State prosecutors said Friday that 68-year-old Richard Parker of Standish also agreed to pay $75,000 in fines after pleading guilty to crimes related to poaching.

The two firearms that Parker used to shoot the wildlife were ordered destroyed by the court.

Wildlife officers began investigating Parker last March after receiving a tip by someone who saw a man kill a hawk near the town of Standish, 135 miles northeast of Sacramento.

When they searched Parker's property, officers found 159 dead animals, most of them red-tailed hawks but also two bobcats and a mountain lion.

The body of man who was in a tow truck that plummeted into the Sacramento River two weeks ago was recovered Thursday, family members and the California Highway Patrol said.Shalvinesh Sharma’s body was found around 8:45 a.m. south of Stan's Yolo Marina, which is toward the West Sacramento side of the river, authorities said.Shalvinesh Sharma, 40, was in the tow truck with his wife Roselyn Sharma when the truck plunged into the river after a crash with a big rig on the Pioneer Bridge. The collision hurtled the truck over the bridge rails and into the water.Roselyn Sharma's body has not been recovered.Family and CHP identified Shalvinesh Sharma’s body because of the tow truck company uniform he was wearing and a tattoo.“They’re really good people. They always crack jokes, have fun,"" the couple's 17-year-old son Justin Sharma said Wednesday. ""They were really close to everyone. It’s just sad you know. Really good people and they’re not here anymore.”The recovery of Shalvinesh Sharma’s body comes as crews were moving forward on a recovery operation for the tow truck. A private dive company is slated to enter the water Friday.The recovery effort was slow to finalize as CHP and family worked out who would pay. The family said their insurance company is covering the more $500,000 cost.To recover the truck, divers first have to physically touch the truck to confirm its location, CHP said. Then, divers will attach chains from a crane on the barge to the tow truck to pull it out. The private dive company is bringing in heavier weights to keep divers safe in the fast current and high-powered hoses to move the debris that has since covered the tow truck.The company, Global Diving & Salvage, is transporting a barge from Vallejo on Thursday morning and is expected to arrive by nightfall.The couple’s son said he is focusing on what he can control as he heads toward his high school graduation next month -- just two days before his mother’s birthday.“Make sure I get my education ‘cause that’s what my mom really wanted for me,"" Justin Sharma said Wednesday. ""To have a really good education and do something good after high school and go to college, have a good job and a nice degree. And, that’s what I want for my sister as well.”The family has set up a GoFundMe page for the children.",https://www.kcra.com/article/shalvinesh-sharma-california-sacramento-river-tow-truck-body-recovered/27119630,2019-04-12T00:28:00Z,KCRA-TV,Couple,"3 Television Cir, Sacramento, CA 95814, USA",CA,95814
