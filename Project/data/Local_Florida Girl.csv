News outlets reported Saturday that the mother of 16-year-old Layne Chesney announced her death on social media. The girl lived 16 months after she was burned over 95% of her body.

Authorities say Chesney was sitting by the bonfire when she picked up a can of gasoline to fuel the fire. The can exploded in her hands, engulfing her in flames.

Doctors initially gave her only a 1% chance of survival. She endured about 200 surgeries and medical procedures.

Chesney was a softball standout, leading the Jensen Beach Wildcats to the 2017 Babe Ruth World Series and getting attention from college coaches when she was injured.",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-teen-dies-of-burns-from-2017-new-years-eve-bonfire/1997898064,2019-05-12T19:47:10Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

2,"Florida girl screams, runs for help as car follows her home","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. (WESH)— An emotional mother shared the details of a frightening moment involving her child.

She said her middle school daughter was followed home from school on Thursday and approached by a man in a car with a camera.

That student and her family spoke exclusively with WESH 2's Kelsi Thorud about what they said was a situation that could have ended much differently.

""It's just shocking because if I didn't do (anything), if I didn't run or anything, he probably would have gotten out of the car and probably grabbed me,"" the young girl said.

The sixth-grade student, who does not wish to be identified by WESH 2 News, said she was walking home from Freedom Middle School Thursday afternoon when she noticed a man in a black car.

""He's like, old looking, and he has a camera in his hand and he's smiling at me and telling, with his finger, telling me to come here,"" she said.

The girl said she immediately felt uncomfortable, so she started running.

""I run and he's still following me, and when he's still following me, I'm about over there, and I'm running and crying and screaming, 'Help me,' so someone could come and stuff,"" the child said.

Part of it was caught on surveillance video from the apartment complex the girl lives in.

In the video, the child is seen running to the gate, and a black car is seen pulling in right behind her.

""I could sense my daughter was scared by the way she was running. I've never seen her run like that before,"" the girl's mother said.

The girl's mother said she truly believes the man in the car wanted to take her daughter.

""It's a parent's worst nightmare to see something like that, and to know that there's people out there watching children like that, to try to take them or do whatever they want to do with them,"" she said.

The family said they've filed a police report and now they just want to warn parents in the area.

""Talk to your kids. Let them know stuff like this can happen. You may not think it can or will, but it does happen,"" the child's mother said.

The Orange County Sheriff's Office says it is investigating this incident.",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-girl-screams-runs-for-help-as-car-follows-her-home/1996636840,2019-05-11T20:31:52Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
4,Florida mom accused of sending girl to school with 'hundreds of bugs' in her backpack,"SANTA ROSA COUNTY, Fla. - A Florida mother accused of keeping her children in a home infested with roaches and littered in cat feces was arrested after her daughter brought a backpack filled with ""hundreds of bugs"" to school, according to the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office.

The investigation began April 18 when a second-grade teacher noticed one of her students had been wearing the same clothes all week and smelled of feces and urine, the report said. The girl said she didn't know the last time she had a bath.

School officials gave the girl clean clothes because hers were caked in filth, according to the report. The teacher also told a school resource officer that ""hundreds of bugs"" once crawled out of the girl's backpack, at which time the student admitted that her home had a roach infestation, authorities said.

The teacher told deputies that the student has suffered hygiene problems for the duration of the academic year. The student also complained of being tired because she had to sleep in her mother's bed since there was days-old vomit in hers, seemed depressed and would have meltdowns, according to the report.

The girl's mother, Jessica Stevenson, met with the teacher earlier in the year and berated her because she suspected her of calling the Department of Children and Families, officials said. She never followed through with getting counseling for her children as the school suggested.

Deputies said they went to Stevenson's home April 18 and found roaches on nearly every surface, extreme filth, bleach and chemicals within the reach of the children, piles of cat feces, dirty dishes with rotten food in the sink, a microwave hanging out the window by its cord, glass from broken windows on the floor and bags of trash.

There was no food in the fridge or cabinets except for spoiled milk and eggs, a stick of butter and some sugar, the report said.

The five children had little or no clothes in their rooms and no linens on their bed, but Stevenson's room was clean with minimal roaches, a closet full of clothing, a flat-screen TV and some snacks, according to authorities.

Stevenson was arrested May 3 on five counts of child neglect without great bodily harm. She has since bonded out of jail.

She told WEAR that she's not allowed to have contact with her children, ages 5, 7,11, 12, and 14. She also told the TV station that she was unfairly targeted by the school and Sheriff's Office.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - A Florida woman was arrested last week after her daughter's school found ""hundreds of bugs"" in the girl's backpack, prompting the Florida Department of Children and Families to visit their home, the Pensacola News Journal reported.

The employee noted that her second-grade daughter had been wearing the same clothing for a week. When asked when her last bath had been, the student said she did not know, authorities said.

On one occasion, “hundreds of bugs crawled out” of the student’s “backpack in the lunchroom,” the report stated.

A teacher said the school had repeatedly given the girl clean clothing, but each new outfit would be worn continuously until it was worn out and another outfit would be provided by the school.

The teacher also noted that the girl was frequently crying, “having meltdowns” and seemed depressed, the report stated.

The girl has four other siblings between the ages of 5 and 14, two of which attend Bagdad Elementary School.

When deputies visited Stevenson's home, they discovered an infestation of roaches, broken windows and bags of trash throughout the home and yard.

“The roaches were on nearly every surface in the home” including “on the children’s mattress, in the pots and pans in the kitchen, and inside the cabinets/fridge,"" the report stated.

There was no edible food inside of the home. The cabinets were empty of food and the refrigerator had two cartons of spoiled milk, spoiled eggs, sugar and a stick of butter.

Stevenson's bedroom, however, was ""abnormally"" clean with minimal roaches and a stashed bag of snacks, according to the report.

Stevenson was charged with five felony counts of child neglect without great bodily harm and booked into the Santa Rosa County Jail Friday. She was released Saturday on a $2,500 bond.

In an interview with Pensacola ABC affiliate WEAR, the mother disputed the report, claiming she had been targeted ""unfairly.""

The girl is one of five siblings ages 5 to 14 who lived in a ""filthy"" Milton home infested with roaches, soiled mattresses on the floor, piles of cat feces, no edible food, broken windows, and bags of trash throughout the home and yard, according to a Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office report.

26,"Recordings capture Florida teachers cursing, screaming at students with autism","PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. (WSVN/CNN) - Parents of special needs students at an elementary school in Florida are demanding accountability after teachers at the school were recorded cursing and screaming at the children.

Most of them aren't very verbal, but when some of the kids started saying strange words at home, the parents got suspicious about what was happening in the classroom.

The special needs class at Pasadena Lake Elementary was empty on Thursday. Instead, all of the students, who are on the autism spectrum, are home. Their parents are too afraid to send them to school.

""I was just mindblown because it never even entered my mind that a teacher is capable of doing such a thing to a child,"" said parent Miriam Adar. ""He is defenseless.""

This all started when one of the 6-year-old children started cursing and his parents couldn't understand why.

""My son mimics everything he hears,"" said parent Matt Adar. ""He was saying it in an aggressive tone. Get over here, I'm going to F you up. Get over here, I'm going to mess you up. So I knew that it was an authoritative figure.""

He put a device in his son's backpack. It's called an ""Angel Sense,"" and it's made for children on the autism spectrum. Their parents can call it and listen in.

What they heard the special education teachers saying to the mostly non-verbal children in the classroom is disturbing.

""So do your work. (Inaudible) Drag your ass over there. Watch me. Try me.""

You can hear the teachers cursing.

""That mother (expletive) say (expletive) to me.""

And you hear teachers getting angry.

""You better not touch me or scratch me you understand? You are getting a diaper change!""

In one clip, you hear this little girl named Mercedes screaming.

""Why are you not doing your work? Why are you not doing your work? Go to timeout. Go to timeout.""

Mercedes' parents say that clip is from the same day the child came home with a bruise on her arm.

""That is fear. That is panic,"" said Mercedes' mother Gisela Lopez. ""She was in pain. She was in real pain. I know that cry.""

All the parents met together and notified the Broward Sheriff's Office, who is now investigating.

""It is not just that they are being mean to our children,"" said parent Jason Segelbaum. ""It is that they are being mean to our children and they know for a fact that they believe they can get away with all of this.""

Broward Schools is also investigating and issued a statement that says ""Upon becoming aware of allegations involving a teacher and teacher's aide, school administrators took swift action and immediately removed the employees from the classroom.""

School administration followed proper protocol and contacted all appropriate agencies, including the district's special investigation unit.

""This is a school. This is a public school,"" said parent Lauren Segelbaum. ""his is where you expect your kids to be safe and not have to worry.""

The district says the teacher and the aide have been reassigned while the investigation continues.",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/recordings-capture-florida-teachers-cursing-screaming-at-students-with-autism/1996673055,2019-05-11T21:09:50Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

33,Florida woman arrested after hundreds of bugs crawl out of child’s backpack,"ORLANDO — A Florida woman was arrested after a second-grader in her care repeatedly showed up to school in clothes caked in filth and a backpack filled with “hundreds” of bugs, deputies in the Panhandle said.

The girl is one of five siblings ages 5 to 14 who lived in a “filthy” Milton home infested with roaches, soiled mattresses on the floor, piles of cat feces, no edible food, broken windows and bags of trash throughout the home and yard, according to a Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office report.

Jessica Nicole Stevenson, 33, was arrested Friday and charged with five felony counts of child neglect without great bodily harm.

Deputies said Stevenson’s bedroom was “abnormally” clean compared with the condition of the rest of the home, with a flat-screen TV and bed linens. In contrast to the children’s closets, hers was filled with clean clothes, according to the report.

The children’s living conditions came to the attention of staff at Bagdad Elementary school, which three of the siblings attend, the probable cause affidavit said.

The second-grader told authorities she didn’t know when her last bath or shower had been. School staffers said they had repeatedly given the girl clean clothing to wear but that the child kept showing up dressed in the same outfits several days in a row as they became dirtier and dirtier.

A Florida Department of Children and Families report about the three siblings who attended the elementary school led to the sheriff’s office launching an investigation April 18, the Pensacola News Journal reported.

The newspaper reported that Stevenson made bond the day after her arrest and was released Saturday, the day after her arrest.

38,Florida family sues JUUL and tobacco giants,"Lawsuit against e-cigarette maker and Altria claims they intentionally target teens

SARASOTA COUNTY — A Sarasota County girl and her parents are suing an e-cigarette maker and two tobacco giants for allegedly breaking federal laws by intentionally targeting teenagers while falsely denying doing so.

The class action lawsuit, brought by Sarasota County residents Erin and Jared NesSmith and their daughter, identified in court documents only as A.N., accuses e-cigarette company JUUL Labs Inc. and tobacco company Altria Group Inc., which owns Philip Morris USA Inc., the maker of Marlboro, of violating federal racketeering laws by purposely exploiting adolescents and getting them hooked on the aerosol devices that deliver a more powerful hit of nicotine than cigarettes, while denying the calculated marketing moves, according to court documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida on April 15.

Philip Morris recently acquired a 35 percent ownership interest in JUUL.

The family is seeking damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and for fraud, product liability and deceptive trade practices for themselves and potentially thousands of other unnamed plaintiffs in the suit.

“JUUL knew that JUUL e-cigarettes were not safe for nonsmokers, and posed a risk of aggravating addiction in those already addicted to cigarettes,” the suit states.

The family could not be reached for comment.

A JUUL representative denied in an email to the Herald-Tribune that the company targets teens.

“Our product is intended to be a viable alternative for current adult smokers only. We do not want nonnicotine users, especially youth, to ever try our product,” JUUL representative Ted Kwong said. “To this end, we have launched an aggressive action plan to combat underage use as it is antithetical to our mission. To the extent these cases allege otherwise, they are without merit and we will defend our mission throughout this process.""

In the suit, the girl, 15, claims she is addicted to JUUL and now suffers from seizures — a complication of nicotine ingestion, according to the lawsuit. The teen began using the electronic cigarettes, which look like an USB drive and comes in fruity flavors such as mango, when she was 14. She was unaware the device contained nicotine when she began “JUULing,” and inadvertently on occasion swallowed the e-liquid nicotine in the JUUL device, according to court documents.

“Mimicking Big Tobacco’s past marketing practices, defendants prey on youth to recruit replacement smokers for financial gain,” the suit states.

Her parents and their lawyers say she has fallen victim to the e-cigarette epidemic affecting youth.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, e-cigarette use from 2011 to 2014 among high school students soared from 1.5 percent to 13.4 percent, and among middle school students from 0.6 percent to 3.9 percent. Spending on e-cigarette advertising — which often includes bright colors attractive to teens and depicts smoking e-cigarettes as cool and hip — rose from $6.4 million in 2011 to an estimated $115 million in 2014.

The suit also cites additional CDC data that found 4.9 million middle and high school students were current users of a tobacco product in 2018, meaning they used such products in the past 30 days. That figure represents an increase of 1.3 million users since 2017.

Sarasota County schools this year began tracking youth use of e-cigarettes, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has characterized as an epidemic. Local school officials in January found 224 documented incidents of e-cigarette use in schools. That number has since increased to 327, district spokeswoman Tracey Beeker said in an email. There are 43,000 students in the district.

JUUL's plan for deterring youth use, according to the company's website, includes deactivating Facebook and Instagram accounts for marketing, suspending the sale and distribution of nontobacco and nonmenthol JUUL pods to more than 90,000 retail stores and requiring online consumers to be at least 21 to purchase its products.

But the family's lawyer, Scott Schlesinger of the Fort Lauderdale-based Schlesinger Law Firm, claims JUUL’s aim is to hook people when they’re young and most susceptible to addiction.

“There’s an opportunity to get customers when they’re vulnerable in their youth, because that’s when the brain is vulnerable to this drug addiction,” Schlesinger said, adding the pending litigation could last for years. “That’s the dirty little secret of the nicotine delivery industry.”

The FDA has the power to cap nicotine levels in e-cigarettes, but hasn’t proposed any standard. For cigarettes, there’s no limit on nicotine, although the FDA has taken preliminary steps toward reducing levels to help smokers quit. JUUL, like all e-cigarettes in the country, has not been approved to help smokers quit. The FDA isn’t expected to begin reviewing the contents and health effects of e-cigarettes for at least two more years, according to a recent report by the Associated Press.

Juul has published little peer-reviewed research, and only in the last year have independent researchers begun studying its formula. The company says each of its full-strength pods delivers about as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. Researchers at Portland State University analyzed the concentration of Juul’s full-strength pod against nine other nicotine formulas on the market in 2017. Juul’s nicotine level dwarfed its competitors, in some cases by twentyfold, according to the AP report.

Meanwhile, Schlesinger is considering filing a federal petition asking the courts to prohibit retailers from selling the devices.

“An adolescent nicotine epidemic is a public health emergency that requires immediate action,” Schlesinger said.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190506/florida-family-sues-juul-and-tobacco-giants?rssfeed=true,2019-05-06T13:59:33Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, faces multiple charges of aggravated child abuse, child abuse, tampering with evidence and several drug-related charges.

51,"Florida cold case murder of Laralee Spear, 15, perplexes detectives 25 years later","The lone person ever indicted remains on death row in 2 other killings, but is not considered a suspect in this case.

Deerfoot Road had been insulated from violence before April 26, 1994.

It was known to be a tranquil place. The rural, narrow dirt road leads to a lakeside park where wildlife roam.

Twenty-five years ago, an abduction and a series of gunshots radically changed the complexion of that tucked-away location near DeLand.

Violence appeared at Deerfoot and no one knows who brought it there.

Laralee Spear, 15-year-old DeLand High School freshman, was shot to death moments after getting off her school bus. Her body was found on a concrete slab behind a burned-out house about 200 yards from her home and about a half-mile from her stop at the corner of Deerfoot and South Spring Garden Avenue. Her murder remains unsolved.

“This child got off the bus at 3:15 (p.m.) and at 5:30 (p.m.) we find her,” said Volusia County Sheriff’s Detective Steve White, the agency’s lead cold case detective. “It’s just unbelievable to me that could happen in that location so fast (to) a child who’s not involved in any activities that would put her in danger.”

The full chronology of that afternoon has Spear getting off her bus at 3:15 p.m. Her mother, Barbara Spear, reported her daughter missing at 4:05 p.m.

Eight minutes later, deputies were dispatched to the Spear home. They showed up eight minutes after that and started searching.

At 4:59 p.m., deputies in Air One, the Sheriff’s Office’s helicopter, joined the search party.

At 5:35 p.m., one of those deputies in the air saw a body lying behind the abandoned house. Those on the ground confirmed the girl’s identity.

White was working as a detective in the New Smyrna Beach office at the time. During the next few days, he and other detectives from the east side were ordered to assist in the Laralee Spear investigation. Everything else was put on hold.

“I came into work the next morning and it was, ‘Grab your stuff. You’re (temporary duty) in DeLand until they release you,’ ” he said. “My office, the Ormond (Beach) office all got together and we went over to DeLand and got our assignments. We did neighborhood canvassing for a week.”

More than 1,000 leads were called in during that first month after the murder. The case still wound up cold.

Detectives were told by the girl’s mother that it was out of character for her to wander off by herself. If she took any additional time to walk home, it was only to spend a few extra minutes to get a closer look at her neighbor’s horses. The Sheriff’s Office concluded early in the investigation that someone attacked Laralee Spear during her walk — when she was out of sight from the Spring Garden intersection.

It was estimated by one of the detectives working on the case that she had walked 200 yards before encountering her killer. He also concluded Spear was dead within 25 minutes from when she got off the bus.

Ralph Henshaw, who retired from the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office about a decade before the murder, is now a volunteer investigator with the agency’s Cold Case Unit. He was recruited by former sheriff Ben Johnson for the purpose of delving into the Spear case.

He has absorbed every detail.

“The bus driver (saw) her get off,” Henshaw said, recalling what witnesses told detectives. “She didn’t seem to have any problem. There was no on around the area (who looked) strange.”

A small group of people were selling plants near Spear’s stop. They watched Spear get off the bus and head toward her house. They noticed nothing suspicious.

A neighbor in one of the half-dozen or so houses along Deerfoot often would sit outside in his wheelchair in the afternoon. On this particular day, he wasn’t feeling well and didn’t come outside, Henshaw said.

There is no telling what he would have seen or heard had he been outside. Either way, there was one fewer set of eyes on that street.

“She walked by like she did every day, every school day, and nobody (saw) her after that,” Henshaw said.

Laralee Spear was an elite student. She was a cheerleader and a member of the Keyettes, a school service organization. She sang in her church choir and played piano. She was known to be a wholesome girl. She had a reputation for being punctual. Her principal called her a model student.

“She was an exceptional young lady,” Henshaw said.

Someone far below exceptional became the focus of the investigation in November 1994.

Bobby Allen Raleigh, a high school dropout, was charged in the double murder of two men in DeLeon Springs. The victims were slain six weeks after the Spear murder. The two men were asleep in a trailer when Raleigh and his accomplice, Domingo Figueroa, shot them in their sleep. They kept shooting the second victim until their guns jammed. After realizing the victim was still alive, Raleigh took his gun and beat the man until he stopped breathing.

While in jail awaiting trail for the double murder, Raleigh allegedly told an inmate he had killed Spear. That’s what the State Attorney’s Office disclosed to the media. Raleigh was indicted for first-degree murder in the Spear case.

For the DeLeon Springs double murder, Raleigh was convicted and sentenced to death row, where he remains to this day. His accomplice is serving a life sentence.

Raleigh, who was 20 at the time of his arrest and is now 44, seemed resigned to his fate in the double murder. By comparison, he was adamant he had nothing to do with the Spear killing. A special prosecutor who was later assigned to the case agreed. He dropped all charges against Raleigh in 1998.

Today, no one associated with the case seems to have any lingering suspicions about Raleigh.

“I don’t look at him as a suspect at all,” Henshaw said. He and Sheriff’s Sgt. A.J. Pagliari interviewed Raleigh face-to-face a few years ago and didn’t come away thinking he had anything to do with Spear’s murder.

“There was not enough then to pursue him criminally and there is nothing that has changed since that time to make us think he is at the top of any persons of interest list,” Pagliari said.

White and Pagliari said 66 people have been investigated since the start of the case. Pagliari indicated that nobody has emerged as a suspect.

“Has anything come to light that says this person is more of a suspect than somebody else? No,” he said.

Thirteen years after the murder, in April 2007, the Sheriff’s Office held a media conference with Virginia “Ginny” Spear, Laralee’s younger sister. She helped deputies distribute fliers to DeLand-area homes and businesses. It was a media blitz to get the case back in the news and on the minds of residents in the hopes it would induce someone to come forward with information. Those efforts came up empty.

Any forthcoming break in the case, according to the Sheriff’s Office, would likely come from the forensic side. Any future advances in forensic technology could be beneficial to the investigation. Pagliari declined to be more specific.

The girl’s parents, David and Barbara Spear, were out of town and unavailable for an interview. They have seldom spoken publicly about the case. Henshaw said he remains in contact with them.

When Henshaw was recruited to join the Cold Case Unit as a volunteer, Johnson drove him to the crime scene. Those who investigate old, unsolved cases often develop an attachment to the victims of those cases. Henshaw feels that connection with Spear. It started to form during that ride with Johnson years ago.

“He took me in his own car down to the crime scene and showed me where it was at,” Henshaw said. “We were hoping, and still are, that we will solve this case.”

Anyone with information about the Laralee Spear murder case is urged to call the Cold Case Unit at 386-254-1535.

It’s the biggest musical Kody C. Jones has ever directed — and it might be one of the biggest to play Florida Repertory Theatre, too.

The show, itself, was a huge Broadway hit. “Newsies” won Tony Awards for Best Choreography and Best Original Score in 2012. Plus it was nominated for Best Musical, too.

And then there’s the Florida Rep cast: A sprawling 51 people, mostly teens, singing and dancing onstage. It's so big, in fact, that Jones had to cast actors from as far away as Naples for the Fort Myers production.

“We’ve never done a really, really big Broadway musical,” says Jones, who heads Florida Rep’s Education Department and directs its youth-theater production of ""Newsies.” “It’s just kind of time.”

The musical is performed mostly by students in Florida Rep’s Conservatory program for young actors and theater artists. It tells the story of the real-life 1899 newsboys strike in New York City, where the poor orphans and runaways who sold newspapers on the street demonstrated for two weeks over planned newspaper price increases.

Sure, most of the kids acting in “Newsies” don’t know much about newsprint, Jones says. They get their news online and on social media.

But the story still resonates for today’s teens, thanks to recent youth movements to push for gun control and other political change. It involves kids and their voices — voices that need to be heard, voices that can change the world for the better.

“That’s what this show is all about,” Jones says.

The story takes on still-relevant issues such as workers’ rights and womens’ rights, Jones says, and it does it with high-energy songs, lots of dancing and a story that grabs you in from the start.

That’s why teen actor Jesse Massari loves the show. She’s a fan of both the 2012 Broadway musical and the original 1992 Disney movie it’s based on.

“It’s the story,” says Massari, 18, a senior at Cypress Lake High School in south Fort Myers. “It just draws you in. … It’s just putting yourself in these people’s shoes and their struggle.”

Massari plays a female newspaper reporter who champions the newsboys’ cause. “She meets the newsboys and falls in love with their mission and what they’re striking for,” she says.

One of those newsboys is “Crutchie,” a polio-stricken 14-year-old with a crippled leg.

“He’s the underdog of the show,” says actor Matteo Occhino, 17, of Fort Myers, who plays the character in the Florida Rep production.

Occhino says he’s been having a great time working on the massive, energetic musical. “It’s a fun, powerful show,” says Occhino, a Cypress Lake High junior. “It’s just an experience. I’ve never worked on a show like this before.”

That’s not all that’s happening with Florida Rep’s Theatre Conservatory Program and Education Department, either.

53,South Florida baby born with rare skin disorder,"POMPANO BEACH, Fla. - When Carolina Fenner went into labor in March, she was anticipating the joy of welcoming her baby girl, already named Luna, into the world.

But moments after the birth, her excitement was tempered by confusion.

""They gave me the baby and I was like, 'What?' The only picture they have of me holding is her is 'What's this?' I was shocked and the doctor said, 'Oh, I think it's a birthmark,'"" Fenner said.

But it was far more than that covering the majority of little Luna's face.

She was born with a disfiguring and potentially cancerous growth called a giant congenital melanocytic nevus, which is the result of malfunctioning cells we all have in our skin called melanocytes.

""The second day, a doctor came to see me and he said, 'Mom, be prepared for cancer because the mark is so big,' but they never told me about the nevus disease,"" Fenner said.

Carolina Fenner started a support group on Instagram after her daughter was born with a rare skin condition.

In her search for support, Fenner started an Instagram page called Luna.Love.Hope. The number of followers of the page is growing by thousands every day.

""Everybody started painting their faces like Luna and sending me pictures,"" she said.

When she contacted to Local10 News, an effort was launched to find a doctor to help baby Luna.

Within weeks, she connected with Nicklaus Children's Hospital pediatric plastic surgeon Dr. Anthony Wolfe, who explained the long and complex process of removing the nevus.

""I told the mother we'd start with the eyes and the nose to try to get that taken care of first,"" Wolfe said.

Before he can start surgically removing the nevus, Wolfe will need to harvest skin from other areas of Luna's face, neck and body.

""You can use tissue expanders. You can use skin grafts. Eyelid skin, which we're going to have to replace in her, we often get that from the upper arm because it's quite thin there and it makes good eyelid skin,"" Wolfe said.

The process will start this summer with procedures spaced out over the next three to four years.

""He was wonderful because I was expecting much less than what he offered her,"" Fenner said of Wolfe. ""He brought me hope, and I'm more relaxed now.""

Fenner knows the road ahead will be long and painful for Luna, but she's grateful to be able to protect her daughter from possible health risks and the pain of public scrutiny.

56,"WATCH: Florida cop making arrest is kneed, kicked in face by student","Photo credit: @onlyindade via Instagram Photo credit: @onlyindade via Instagram

- Video from an altercation inside a Florida high school on Thursday shows a student kneeing and then kicking a police officer, both times in the officer’s face, while the officer is apprehending another student.

The student doing the kicking was identified as Shardae Yvonne Pittman, 18, who was charged with battery on a law enforcement officer and interfering at an educational institution, the Miami Herald reported. She was being held at Miami-Dade County’s Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on a $5,500 bond, the report said.

Cellphone video of the officer being kicked was posted on a private Instagram account by a user with the handle @onlyindade.

At the time of the incident, the police officer was arresting a 17-year-old girl who was allegedly involved in a cafeteria fight, the newspaper reported. As a result of the kicks from the 18-year-old, the officer suffered a cut lip and abrasions, the report said.

“It is a shame that while this officer was attempting to break up a fight and maintain a safe learning environment, this adult student acted in a cowardly way rather than fall in line with MDCPS values,” Miami-Dade Schools Police Chief Edwin Lopez wrote on Twitter.

A chaotic scene unfolded Thursday at Homestead Senior High School when several students got into a fight and one of them is caught on video kicking a police officer in the head.

The school district also issued a statement:

“Any behavior that endangers the well-being of students and staff at Miami-Dade County Public Schools will not be tolerated, will be handled swiftly, and result in severe consequences. When that behavior involves battery on a police officer, as it did today, offenders will be arrested and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Students will also be disciplined according to the Code of Student Conduct, up to, and including, expulsion.”

The 17-year-old who was being arrested at the time was charged with resisting arrest with violence, but was later released, Fox affiliate WSVN of Miami reported.

The teen’s mother told WSVN that she shouldn’t have been charged at all. She claimed that two students “jumped” her daughter, sparking a melee.

“She’s the victim. Of course she’s the victim,” parent Sharnelle Lee said about her daughter. “They just charged her with resisting arrest with officer. She never did anything to the officer. I asked the officer to show me the video. The video was never shown to me. Two girls jumped my daughter, so apparently, she was defending herself.”

59,12-year-old Florida girl hopes to save lives with car seat invention,"UMATILLA — A Umatilla Middle School student who won first place at the state science fair in March is now pursuing a patent for her life-saving technology.

Seventh-grader Alexandra “Lexie” Clow won $750 in prize money after her project, called the pediatric heat stroke prevention device, earned her a spot in the international BroadCom competition in Washington D.C. She’s also won awards at the Lockheed Martin Science Challenge in Orlando, netting her an additional $400.

“I haven’t spent a cent of the money I’ve won,” Lexie said. “I want to put it all toward the patent.”

The patent would protect the core mechanics of her device, a car seat designed to alert people when a baby has been left in a hot car, as she continues to promote and develop it.

Lexie and her family decided a couple months ago to pursue the patent as she prepared to go to the state science fair for her second year of competition.

“We thought, hey, let’s help her get a patent on this,” father Rick Clow said. “It’s not really a big deal.”

As they came to find out, it was a bigger deal than they expected.

You might think the patent process is inexpensive and simple, but Rick Clow said the U.S. Patent Office has become the domain of lawyers more than the average person.

Companies have lawyers to handle the process, but individuals have to seek out specialized attorneys.

In the meantime, the family has registered Lexie's project as patent pending, which Clow said was a simple and accessible first step.

To get the rest of the way, the family has started a GoFundMe campaign describing the project and asking for $15,000 to navigate the patent process.

Currently, the GoFundMe is sitting at $1,410. One $100 donation came from the Lake County Sheriff’s Office, which also gave Lexie a signal boost for her project after she won the science fair.

Lexie hopes to secure the patent prior to the international science fair in October, where it will go before an international audience.

She also wants the patent so she can take the device to the next level of development. Currently, the device works with a mostly wired system and a few radio frequency transmitters.

It's an independently powered car seat that gets hooked into a car's electronics in order to turn on the lights and honk the horn when it detects the weight of a baby and heat around 104 degrees Fahrenheit. It activates cooling fans to increase a baby's chances of surviving, and the seat also has bright blue LEDs on the side to draw the eye straight toward the seat.

Lexie said she hopes it can be developed as an accessory to smarter cars, with an app to alert parents who are walking away from their car without their child because, yes, it happens.

Ideally, it would even be a part of the car, rather than a standalone seat, she said.

Lexie said her goal was to keep the technology affordable. She used cheap, easily accessible components so it could be replicated for just a few hundred dollars.

""I want to fix something that's a problem locally for us,"" Lexie said. When she found out Florida had the second most pediatric heat stroke deaths in the U.S., she decided it was a preventable problem and she wanted to solve it.

58 children died of heat stroke in 2018, she said, one of which occurred in Sanford. Lexie thinks she can help lower that number.

Help Lexie on her journey for a patent!

The baby was born with the same disabilities as the teenager, according to the girl’s family. They said the teenager does not understand her relation to the baby.

Carlos Carrizales, 61, was sentenced Monday to life in prison. He was convicted last month of felonies including incest, Lakeland’s The Ledger reported. It was not immediately clear what Carrizales' relationship to the teen was.

The non-verbal teenager carried out the pregnancy and gave birth to her daughter in early 2017. Carrizales was arrested that November.

Investigators discovered the girl's pregnancy in 2016 and subsequent DNA testing led authorities to Carrizales. DNA tests showed he was 99.99 percent likely to be the baby's father. Assistant State Attorney Lauren Randall said two independent tests had the same result.

75,Orange County man back behind bars after peeking inside teen's bedroom,"An Orange County man previously accused of peeking inside of a teenager's bedroom window is now back behind bars on new voyeurism charges.

Deputies arrested Thai Williams, 18, Friday after investigators said a neighbor's home surveillance camera caught him on video looking into a girl's bedroom while using a flashlight last Thursday and Friday morning.

The latest alleged victim did not want to be identified, but she told News 6 that Williams is her former classmate from school and his allegations are concerning.

""Not knowing exactly when or what time he was looking at me, if it was while I was getting ready, or while I didn’t have any clothes on,"" the victim said. ""I wouldn’t wish this upon anyone.""

The alleged victim told us she's still trying to recover from the scare.

""I feel uncomfortable now, myself to get ready in my room, to get ready anywhere, and I’m just very cautious about what I do now,"" she said. ""I never thought this would happen to me now, but it did, and it can happen to anyone.""

Williams faced a jail judge over the weekend in Orange County. She granted him no bond and revoked his bond based on his previous voyeurism charges earlier this year.

Court records show Williams was arrested back in February on similar allegations.

Deputies said video cameras caught Williams on at least six different occasions, from August of 2018 to February 2019, peeking inside of a different former classmate’s bedroom window in a separate Orange County neighborhood. In one case, a neighbor told deputies he saw Williams using a ladder to peek inside of the girl's bedroom, records show.

The latest alleged victim said she hopes Williams remains in jail on no bond.

""All around I hope that he gets the help that he needs because I don’t want any of this to happen again to any other girl.""

Williams remains locked up in the Orange County Jail on a new charge of voyeurism among other charges.

79,Prosecutor: Dogs detected decomposition in Houston missing girl case,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Photos: Houston Police)

HOUSTON (AP) — Trained dogs detected the scent of human decomposition in the vehicle of a man arrested in connection with the disappearance of a 4-year-old Texas girl, according to a prosecutor.

Derion Vence, 26, remained jailed Sunday on a $1 million bond after being arrested a day earlier on a charge of tampering evidence, specifically a human corpse. His next court appearance is set for Monday.

Houston police said investigators have not found Maleah Davis and the investigation is continuing. Authorities have declined to say whether they believe Vence killed Maleah. But prosecutors said in court documents filed Saturday that Vence could face additional charges, including murder.

The investigation began after Vence told police that men in a truck on May 4 had abducted him, Maleah and his 2-year-old son a day earlier, but had freed him and the boy. Vence told investigators he was left in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land and walked to a hospital, where he reported the girl's abduction.

Sugar Land police, who initially interviewed him, said his story kept changing and didn't add up.

Vence, who had lived with Maleah and her mother, reported that his silver Nissan Altima was taken in the abduction, but surveillance video showed that vehicle was used to drop Vence off at the hospital. Police found the car Thursday.

Dogs trained to find cadavers reacted to the trunk of the car, Pat Stayton, a prosecutor with the Harris County District Attorney's Office, said at Vence's probable cause court hearing Saturday night.

Surveillance video from a neighbor showed Vence carrying a large, blue laundry basket with a large trash bag from his apartment on May 3, Stayton said. Vence returned three minutes later without the basket and later he was seen leaving the apartment with cleaning supplies, including bleach.

In the silver Nissan, police found a laundry basket that looked like the one Vence took out of his apartment, Stayton said.

""Both of the dogs reacted to the trunk of the silver Nissan that the defendant had driven and that the blue laundry basket was recovered from, indicating that the dogs were responding to the scent of human decomposition in the vehicle,"" Stayton said.

Investigators also found blood at the apartment, both in the hallway leading to the bathroom and on surfaces inside the bathroom, Stayton said.

At Saturday night's hearing, Vence said he planned to hire a defense attorney.

Rodney Brown, an attorney appointed to represent Vence only for Saturday's hearing, had asked a magistrate judge to set bond at $5,000, saying Vence was a low flight risk and had lived in Houston most of his life.

Stayton argued that Vence was a flight risk and there was ""evidence of deception on the part of the defendant with regard to information he gave to police.""

Police have described Vence as Maleah's stepfather, but Maleah's mother, Brittany Bowens, said through a spokesman that Vence is her former fiance. Quanell X, a local civil rights activist who spoke to reporters on Bowens' behalf on Friday, also said that Vence had abused Maleah.

80,'Rainbow baby' wins Miss Okaloosa toddler division,"CRESTVIEW — When most people meet Karlee Copley, they see a sassy, blonde-headed little girl. For Karlee’s parents, Karisa and Jeremy, she is so much more.

Karlee is a rainbow baby, a name coined for a healthy baby born after a baby is lost because of miscarriage, infant loss, stillbirth or neonatal death.

Karisa and Jeremy lost their newborn son, Jace, 65 minutes after he was born to Edwards syndrome, a very rare chromosome defect.

“It was a dark time,"" Karisa said. “What got us through is family and leaning toward God. If we wouldn’t have put him first, we never would have made it.""

Karisa found out she was expecting a baby about a month after Jace’s passing.

“I was so excited,” Karisa said. “I was working at Asurion, and a friend of mine brought me a pregnancy test. We went to the Tom Thumb and it immediately showed I was pregnant.

“I didn’t care if it was a boy or a girl,” she added. “After I lost Jace, I wanted to try for one more.”

Ten months after the loss of their son, Karisa and Jeremy welcomed a healthy baby girl to the world. Karlee joined big brother Cole as part of the family.

“It was most definitely meant to happen,” Karisa said. “She filled the void. It was perfection; that’s the only way we can describe it.""

On April 28 a panel of judges agreed. Karlee, now 3 years old, won the toddler division of the Miss Okaloosa Pageant.

Karlee had been in two other pageants, but it was the first time she was crowned as the winner.

Karisa said she entered her daughter in the pageant because she is a diva.

“She likes to wear dresses and she likes to twirl,” Karisa said. “I knew that if I found the right dress and put her in it, she would twirl her life away, and that’s exactly what she did. She went out there and let go of my hand and she just twirled.""

When watching a video of her pageant, Karlee said, “That’s me wearing a blue dress and look at my crown right there. That’s where I win the pageant.”

Karisa said the first thing Karlee asked after winning was when she would be in the next pageant.

Karlee is very quick to tell people she loves pageants and her favorite food is “princess food.”

Karisa said watching her daughter grow gives her a lot of pride.

“This is more than I could ever imagine,” she said. “She’s perfect. She’s so smart, full of life, and outgoing.

“I have high hopes for her.”",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190512/rainbow-baby-wins-miss-okaloosa-toddler-division/1?rssfeed=true,2019-05-12T09:02:49Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

HOUSTON (AP) — Houston police say they found “blood evidence” in the apartment of Darion Vence that matches that of the missing 4-year-old girl, Maleah Davis.

In a statement on the arrest of Vence, Houston police say that he has been charged with tampering with evidence.

They also say that Vence was observed carrying a full laundry basket from the apartment.

The laundry basket was found in the trunk of Vence’s silver Nisson Altima, which was recovered in Missouri City, Texas, Thursday.

Vence reported last Saturday that Maleah had been abducted from him.

Darion Vence was arrested without incident at his brother's home in Sugar Land, Texas, about 22 miles (35 kilometers) southwest of Houston, a statement from Houston police said. He was charged with tampering with evidence.



Vence told police last Saturday that men in a pickup truck abducted him, 4-year-old Maleah Davis and his 2-year-old son before freeing him and the boy. But Sugar Land police, who initially interviewed him, said his story kept changing and didn't add up.



Houston police said Saturday that some details of his story turned out to be false. Vence reported his silver Nissan Altima was taken in the abduction but surveillance video showed that vehicle was used to drop Vence off later at a hospital, where he reported the abduction, police said.



""Blood evidence obtained from Vence's apartment has been linked to Maleah,"" the Houston police statement said.



Vence also was observed carrying a full laundry basket from the apartment, police said. That basket was later found in the trunk of the Nissan along with a gas can.



Maleah's mother Brittany Bowens, said Vence is her former fiance. Bowens appeared outside her apartment Friday as Quanell X, a local civil rights activist, addressed reporters on her behalf.



Quanell X said that Vence had abused Maleah and that Bowens believes Vence harmed the girl.



Vence and Bowens were recently in a fight and she broke off their engagement, Quanell X said.



Child Protective Services removed Maleah and her brothers from the home Vence and Bowens shared in August after the girl suffered a head wound, but the children were returned in February, according to an agency spokeswoman.

85,Teenage girl severely burned in 2017 dies of injuries,"FORT PIERCE, Fla. - A Florida teenager who was severely burned at a bonfire on New Year's Eve 2017 has died of her injuries, her family said Friday.

St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office deputies said Layne Chesney, then 14, was at a small get-together with friends on Jan. 31, 2017, in Fort Pierce when she went to pour gasoline on the dying fire. The gas can exploded in the high school freshman's hand, causing third-degree burns over 95 percent of her body.

""Layne was called home today by our creator. She fought a hard battle right until the end, never wanting to quit, because quitting was not in her nature,"" said Devon Hughes, a family friend. ""We are heart broken, but remain always grateful that she was a part of our lives and world. We just wish it had been for a lot longer with us here on Earth.""

Three other people -- Layne's friend, Hunter Holmes, and his parents, Robert Scott and Stephanie Holmes -- were also burned while trying put out the flames that engulfed Layne.

Layne was initially treated at Lawnwood Medical Center in Fort Pierce, but she was airlifted to Kendall Regional Medical Center in southwest Miami-Dade County because the hospital has a specialized burn unit.

Kendall's burn center is staffed by specialized doctors, nurses and technicians. Patients come from as far away as the Cayman Islands and Haiti to receive treatment.

Chesney said the only part of Layne's body that wasn't burned was the bottom of her feet.

87,Man arrested in connection with attempted kidnapping of 12-year-old girl in Miami,"Terry Rivers, 50, of Miami, is accused of groping and trying to kidnap a 12-year-old girl in Miami.

MIAMI - A 50-year-old man was arrested Thursday in connection with the attempted kidnapping of a 12-year-old girl in Miami, authorities said.

Terry Rivers, of Miami, faces charges of kidnapping and lewd and lascivious molestation of a child.

According to an arrest report, the victim was walking to her bus stop the morning of April 12 in the area of Northwest First Avenue and 57th Street when she was approached by Rivers.

""Hey. Where are you going?"" Rivers asked her, according to the report.

""I'm going over there,"" the girl responded.

""But where are you going?"" Rivers asked again, according to the report.

Police said the girl ignored Rivers' question and continued walking east.

She told police she turned around a short time later to find Rivers running toward her.

Police said Rivers grabbed the victim by the hair and waist, pulled her toward him and began to grope her breast.

89,Duval County suspends more African-American students than any school district in Florida,"0 Duval County suspends more African-American students than any school district in Florida

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - An Action News Jax investigation reveals more African-American students are suspended from schools in Duval County than in any other school district in Florida.

According to state records from the 2017-2018 school year (Opens as Excel file), Duval County Public Schools accounted for 13% of Florida’s out-of-school suspensions for black students, the highest in the state.

TRENDING:

“That is outrageous. Outrageous,"" Lisa Anker said.

Anker's daughter was suspended from Sandalwood High School last year for a fight that was recorded on cellphones and shared. Anker said the video shows her daughter being beaten by another student. When Anker was called to the school a few hours later:

""She was basically punished, packed up and ready to go by the time I went to pick her up,” Anker said.

Anker said the video proved her daughter was attacked, but she says the school suspended her anyway. Both students are African-American.

Documents from the Florida Department of Education show in Duval County, 70 percent of all out-of-school suspensions last school year involved African-American students, even though the group represents about 43 percent of the total student body.

“I think we're in school system now where they feel comfortable treating the children in this manner of suspending them after fights,” Anker said. ""I think something needs to be done. There's no equality, it needs to be looked into and fixed.""

UPDATED: Download the Action News Jax app for live updates on breaking stories

Jackie Simmons is Executive Director of Discipline and Student Services for Duval County Schools.

""My reaction is while we recognize the disproportionality of African-American students being suspended, it’s not just an issue that is germane to Duval County. It is a national and statewide issue,"" Simmons said.

We broke down the top five districts with the highest rates of African-American out-of-school suspensions. In Broward County, 40 percent of the student body is black, but the group accounts for 65 percent of all suspensions.

Using available data from the Department of Education (Opens as Excel file), Action News Jax broke down the numbers by school and found 5 Duval County middle schools had the highest percentage of suspensions for African-American students. While most of the schools are predominantly African-American, we found one school where the disparity is glaring.

At Landmark Middle School, 36 percent of the student body is African American, but the group accounts for 70 percent of all out-of-school suspensions.

Simmons said of the district's efforts to decrease those numbers, “We are focused on an effort to create synergy on decreasing that disparity among African Americans and other ethnic groups.""

“You're dealing with kids from kindergarten through 12th that come to school with different issues and concerns and different ways of dealing with things. I think our job is to put support networks around those kids that allow them opportunity to have a safe space.”

Simmons points to the district's mental health support program, peer to peer and adult mediation, and something new called restorative justice. Students and parents on both sides sit down to talk about the issues driving behavior.

Simmons said Duval County Public Schools 59-page Code of Conduct (Opens as PDF) ensures punishment guidelines are the same regardless of who the student is or where they attend, but he adds, “We try to look at each school independently and each student independently.""

Anker believes that didn't happen in her daughter's case.

""It's become a go-to for them. Let’s just suspend the kids and it will go away,” she said.

According to the State Attorney’s Office, the girl who attacked Lisa Anker’s daughter was arrested in January of this year. Two months later, she pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery. In the report, the investigator said school surveillance and cell phone video showed Anker’s daughter being repeatedly hit.

When we asked DCPS about its handling of the case, a spokesperson sent this statement:

“School and district leaders review disciplinary infractions on our campus in light of the Student Code of Conduct and assign discipline accordingly after an investigation is completed. Investigation includes a review of all available evidence including interviews with participants and witnesses, and a review of video and/or photographic evidence. While we are prohibited by state and federal student confidentiality laws from discussing the specifics of this incident, we can confirm that this investigative process was followed in this case, with reviews done by school officials, district officials and school police over multiple weeks. Our goal is to ensure both the safety of our campuses and the fair and equitable issuance of appropriate school discipline.”

91,Child Baker Acts double in Florida amid lack of long-term resources,"0 Child Baker Acts double in Florida amid lack of long-term resources

More Florida children are being forced into mental health evaluations than ever before.

The latest numbers are due out next month, but 9 Investigates scoured 15 years of data and found child Baker Acts have more than doubled in that time.

Investigative reporter Karla Ray spoke to a mother whose daughter has been in and out of such facilities about the struggle to find long-term treatment.

Inside a local elementary school, a Seminole County mother admits her 11-year-old has attacked teachers, and threatened to take her own life.

“I’m scared of what she's going to do when we're sleeping,” the mother said. “Is that the time she's going to follow through with her threats?”

We’re not identifying the family, but they’re well known to law enforcement. Their oldest child has been taken for involuntary mental evaluations under the state’s Baker Act more than 20 times. Her first was at just 9 years old.

“The first year that she was in the Baker Act facility, she would get out, start punching us, threaten to kill herself and go back the same day she was released,” the mom said.

9 Investigates found the girl is part of a startling increase in children being admitted under the Baker Act in Florida.

According to data compiled by the University of South Florida’s Baker Act Reporting Center, the number more than doubled over the course of 15 years, with children now accounting for 1 in every 6 involuntary commitments in the state.

“What we've been doing is reactive,” attorney Kendra Parris said.

Parris specializes in helping families through Baker Acts. She pointed to a lack of long-term residential mental health treatment for children in Florida as one reason for the high numbers.

“A child is bouncing in and out of a Baker Act facility, and there's nowhere to send them on a long-term basis, so a lot of these parents are forced to go out of state,” Parris said.

That’s something a state task force echoed in 2017, noting ""challenges in accessing services, including denials and limitations by third party payers"" in a final report. The task force also noted Florida, which consistently ranks among the lowest for funding mental health services nationwide, is ""not adequately investing in its children, youth and families.""

“I was actually being told, ‘There's no programs available to her, she needs to go to jail,’” the mother we spoke with said.

That mother says she’s now on two waiting lists for a case manager to try to get her daughter into a residential treatment program. The beds are hard to come by and harder to pay for without the help of insurance or Medicaid.

“You're dealing with somebody who really needs to be there, so we need to have options,” the mom said.

As startling as the increase is, experts say the actual numbers are even higher, because data is only collected on involuntary Baker Acts. Children and families who go to these facilities voluntarily aren’t counted in the total data.

96,Florida girl who requires an extremely rare blood type to survive undergoes major milestone,"- A Florida girl who requires an extremely rare blood type to survive has completed a potentially life-changing surgery.

OneBlood reported on Wednesday that three-year-old Zainab Mughal has completed the most complicated and exhausting part of her cancer treatment. On Monday, she underwent her second bone marrow transplant and received multiple blood transfusions.

It will still reportedly be several months before it is known if Zainab's cancer has been put into remission, but her doctors told OneBlood that she is a ""superhero"" and that they believe she is on the road to recovery.

Zainab still needs additional treatments, OneBlood said in their press release. It is likely that she will need additional blood transfusions as she enters the next phase of her treamtment.

To be a match for Zainab, OneBlood says the following must be met:

Must be exclusively Pakistani, Indian or Iranian descent – meaning the donor’s birth parents are both 100% Pakistani, Indian or Iranian

Must be blood type “O” or “A”

All donations for Zainab must be coordinated with OneBlood in advance to ensure the additional compatibility testing is performed.

OneBlood has found only five compatible donors for Zainab so far. Two are from the United States, two from the United Kingdom, and one from Australia. The five donors have consistently donated each time that they are eligible. They have played a significant role in saving Zainab's life.

PLACERVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A Northern California woman has been arrested on suspicion of abusing four girls she adopted.

The El Dorado County Sheriff’s office said 63-year-old Patricia Taylor was an adoptive mother to the girls, ranging from 11 to 16 years old, and had fostered and adopted several other children in the past who’ve moved out.

An investigation was launched in April when a 14-year-old girl ran away from Taylor’s home in Placerville and told authorities about years of abuse. Detectives talked to Taylor’s other adopted daughters and they made similar allegations.

Taylor was arrested Thursday and booked for investigation of torture, child abuse, false imprisonment, willful cruelty to a child and lewd and lascivious conduct of a child. She’s being held on nearly $1.5 million bail. It wasn’t immediately known if she had a lawyer who could speak on her behalf.

110,"Adopted mom of Dericka Lindsay found guilty of manslaughter, child abuse","When Dericka Lindsay was face-down in a chair, her cousin's weight crushing the air out of her lungs, the young girl's mom wasn't concerned that the child couldn't breathe, a prosecutor alleged.

She wasn't concerned that the 9-year was being ""disciplined"" too harshly.

Her concern was whether the discipline was harsh enough.

That was the case Assistant State Attorney Amy Shea made to jurors in her closing argument Friday in the trial of Grace Joan Smith, and if the verdict is any evidence, jurors were convinced.

It only took jurors about 2.5 hours to find Smith, 71, guilty of aggravated manslaughter of a child and aggravated child abuse.

Smith was one of the three adults in the room when Veronica Green Posey sat on Dericka in an effort to discipline the ""unruly"" child. However, Posey weighed about 320 pounds at the time, and Dericka was unable to draw any breath with Posey on top of her.

► Grace Smith:Woman charged in death of child will be treated for delirium, 'failure to thrive'

► Veronica Posey: Dericka Lindsay case: Woman convicted of murder, sentenced to life for sitting on child

► James Smith:Man sentenced in death of adopted 9-year-old who was sat on

The state argued Smith failed in her duty to protect her child, and engaged in aggravated child abuse that went far beyond what was necessary, reasonable or legal.

Smith's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Bradley Rowe, argued Smith had simply asked a trusted family member help her control a rebellious child, and things had gotten out of hand before she realized it.

Showing photos from the Smith's Navy Point home, Shea described it as a ""house of horrors"" for Dericka and the girl's younger sister. The girls' room had barely any furniture or toys to keep the children occupied.

During an autopsy, the medical examiner found Dericka had severe bruising on her rear indicative of regular and vicious spankings. Dericka had repeatedly tried to run away, and the night before her death she tried to pick the lock on the front door with a kitchen knife and escape.

The autopsy revealed Dericka had been wearing four pairs of panties when she died, which officials interpreted as the girl trying to give herself a little padding in preparation for her next spanking.

""That's all she had to protect herself from what she knew was coming,"" Shea said.

Smith called Posey to help her discipline Dericka for threatening her with a knife and hammer. Both women spanked Dericka, hitting her with a belt, a pipe and a ruler that snapped under the force of the strikes.

According to the evidence, Dericka was running and resisting during the beating, which prompted Posey to sit on her to hold her still.

Twice during the punishment Dericka said she couldn't breathe, and Shea said that Smith had a duty to intervene. Instead — as Smith attested in a recorded interview with Escambia County Sheriff's Office investigators — Smith was more focused on whether the punishment was enough to get Dericka to behave.

""When she says, 'I can't breathe,' (Smith) is thinking, 'Is (Dericka) going to change her behavior?'"" Shea said. ""A reasonable parent is not going to let the child suffer to the point of death to prove their point.""

Bradley Rowe, Smith's attorney, said the Smiths never imagined Posey would kill Dericka, and that everything happened in a span of just a few minutes. He argued from Smith's vantage point, she thought Posey was straddling the arms of the chair and not actually putting her full weight on the girl.

""Grace trusted her niece Veronica. She trusted her completely ... . She was family. She was her niece,"" Rowe said.

Rowe urged jurors not to blame Smith for Posey's actions, but jurors wasted no time indicating they found Smith just as responsible for the child's death.

Judge Jan Shackelford has tentatively set Smith's sentencing date for May 28. The judge also denied Smith's request for bond pending her sentencing.

Grace Smith's husband, James, pleaded no contest to aggravated manslaughter charges and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. Posey was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment for her role in the incident.

112,"Dericka Lindsay death: Girl lived in 'house of horrors,' prosecutor says","When Dericka Lindsay was face-down in a chair, her cousin's weight crushing the air out of her lungs, the young girl's mom wasn't concerned that the child couldn't breathe, a prosecutor alleged.

She wasn't concerned that the 9-year was being ""disciplined"" too harshly.

Her concern was whether the discipline was harsh enough.

That was the case Assistant State Attorney Amy Shea made to jurors in her closing argument Friday in the aggravated manslaughter trial of Grace Joan Smith.

Smith, 71, was one of the three adults in the room when Veronica Green Posey sat on Dericka in an effort to discipline the ""unruly"" child. However, Posey weighed about 320 pounds at the time, and Dericka was unable to draw any breath with Posey on top of her.

► Veronica Posey: Dericka Lindsay case: Woman convicted of murder, sentenced to life for sitting on child

► James Smith:Man sentenced in death of adopted 9-year-old who was sat on

The state argues Smith failed in her duty to protect her child, and engaged in aggravated child abuse that went far beyond what was necessary, reasonable or legal.

Smith's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Bradley Rowe, argues Smith had simply asked a trusted family member help her control a rebellious child, and things had gotten out of hand before she realized it.

Showing photos from the Smith's Navy Point home, Shea described it as a ""house of horrors"" for Dericka and the girl's younger sister. The girls' room had barely any furniture in it and hardly any toys or devices to keep the children occupied.

During an autopsy, the medical examiner found Dericka had severe bruising on her rear indicative of regular and vicious spankings. Dericka had repeatedly tried to run away on several occasions, and the night before her death she had tried to pick the lock on the front door with a kitchen knife in an effort to escape.

The autopsy revealed Dericka had been wearing four pairs of panties when she died, which officials have interpreted as the girl trying to give herself a little padding in preparation for her next spanking.

""That's all she had to protect herself from what she knew was coming,"" Shea said.

Smith called Posey to help her discipline Dericka for the incident with the knife. Both women spanked Dericka, between them hitting her with a belt, a pipe and a ruler that snapped under the force of the blows.

According to the evidence, Dericka was running and resisting during the beating, which is what prompted Posey to sit on her to hold her still.

Twice during the punishment Dericka said she couldn't breathe, and Shea said that Smith had a duty to intervene. Instead, as Smith attested in a recorded interview with Escambia County Sheriff's Office investigators, Smith was more focused on whether the punishment was enough to get Dericka to behave.

""When she says, 'I can't breathe,' (Smith) is thinking, 'Is (Dericka) going to change her behavior?'"" Shea said. ""A reasonable parent is not going to let the child suffer to the point of death to prove their point.""

Bradley Rowe, Smith's attorney, said the Smiths never imagined Posey would kill Dericka, and that everything happened in a span of just a few minutes. He argued from Smith's vantage point, she thought Posey was straddling the arms of the chair and not actually putting her full weight on the girl.

""Grace trusted her niece Veronica. She trusted her completely ... . She was family. She was her niece,"" Rowe said.

Rowe urged jurors not to blame Smith for Posey's actions.

The attorneys finished their closing arguments late Friday morning, and jurors are expected to return a verdict sometime Friday afternoon or evening.

Grace Smith's husband, James, pleaded no contest to aggravated manslaughter charges and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. Posey was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment for her role in the incident.

113,"Elementary school student with special needs bitten, bruised on school bus","GREEN BAY, Wisc. - A 10-year-old student with special needs was found crying, with bruises and bite marks on her arm caused by another student while on the school bus ride home.

Lillian Waldron is developmentally delayed and has the mannerisms of a 2-year-old, WBAY reports. While on the bus, she is strapped into a five-point harness and was sitting behind the driver when the other student began biting her.

The girl's parents said she was inconsolable when they went to pick her up Monday at the bus stop in Green Bay. It wasn't until they gave Lillian a bath when the family returned home did they realize what had made her so upset.

""I was getting her ready for the bath and I took her sweatshirt off and that's when I noticed the major bruising on her upper arm,"" said Lynn Waldron-Moehle, Lillian’s mom.

The principal of Langlade Elementary School viewed video of the incident on the bus.

""He said it was gruesome and horrifying to look at, and that the girl was brutally biting my daughter's arm,"" Lynn says.

The student who bit Lillian is no longer attending the school and district officials say they are investigating the incident.

114,Fort Myers man found guilty of lewd conduct against 9-year-old girl,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Lee County on news-press.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

A Fort Myers man faces up to 60 years in prison after a jury convicted him this week of lewd conduct against a 9-year-old.

According to a news release from the 20th Judicial Circuit, Ricky Tolbert, 46, molested a girl while he was working at R&R Barber Shop in January 2018.

The Office of the State's Attorney release identified him as a habitual offender. Sentencing is June 4. He was convicted of two counts of lewd or lascivious conduct during a three-day trial.

According to a police report, Tolbert would play with children who came into the shop with their parents. In one instance, he lured a 9-year-old child into the back room to play hide and seek and turned off the lights. The child sat on his lap.

The child told police that she felt his penis on her buttocks and thought he had exposed it, but she never saw it, the police report indicated. The girl remained dressed. When an adult returned to the store, Tolbert stood, faced away from her and made a motion like he was zipping his pants.

The child told her mother the next day, who contacted the Fort Myers Police Department.

Police subsequently discovered another child the defendant committed lewd acts on between 2016 and 2017, also at the barber shop, the release stated.

121,Storms in South kill girl in Florida,"A tree fell onto a house in Woodville, Florida, south of Tallahassee, killing the girl and injuring a 12-year-old boy.

ATLANTA — A strong storm system barreling through the South on Friday killed an 8-year-old girl in Florida and threatened to bring tornadoes to large parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia.

A tree fell onto a house in Woodville, Florida, south of Tallahassee, killing the girl and injuring a 12-year-old boy, according to the Leon County Sheriff's Office. The office said in a statement that the girl died at a hospital while the boy suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Their names weren't immediately released.

The same storm system was blamed for the deaths a day earlier of three people in Mississippi and a woman in Alabama.

The threat on Friday shifted farther east, where tornado warnings covered parts of northeast Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia.

The national Storm Prediction Center said 9.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were at a moderate risk of severe weather. The region includes the Charlotte, North Carolina metro area.

Torrential downpours, large hail and a few tornadoes were among the hazards, the National Weather Service in Raleigh, North Carolina, warned.

Radar readings appeared to show a tornado formed in western Virginia's Franklin County, south of Roanoke, though damage on the ground still must be assessed, said National Weather Service Meteorologist Phil Hysell. In South Carolina, authorities urged motorists to avoid part of Interstate 26 — the main artery from Upstate through Columbia and all the way to Charleston — because downed trees had left the roadway scattered with debris.

In Georgia, the storm system knocked down trees, caused flooding and cut off power to tens of thousands of people.

A tree came down on an apartment complex in an Atlanta suburb, but only one person reported a minor injury and was treated at the scene, Gwinnett County fire spokesman Capt. Tommy Rutledge told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

In Forsyth County northeast of Atlanta, three firefighters suffered minor injuries when their firetruck overturned during heavy rain and wind, Fire Department Division Chief Jason Shivers told the newspaper.

Meanwhile, hundreds of people cleaned up part of a central Mississippi town hit hard by a tornado on Thursday.

Volunteers and family members were swarming the north side of Morton, where the National Weather Service says a twister with winds as high as 132 mph (212 kph) hit a neighborhood. More than 20 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. The town of 3,500 is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Jackson.

""When it stopped, there was nothing left,"" Morton resident Sharon Currie told WAPT-TV. ""I was going, 'Oh my God. My house is gone.'""

Forecasters confirmed that 14 tornadoes had touched down in Mississippi and damage from the storm system was reported in at least 24 of the state's 82 counties. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency — the second one he has declared in less than a week due to tornadoes.

Authorities on Friday reported a third storm-related death in the state. Freddie Mobley, 63, died while helping cut a tree that had fallen on a house, Lincoln County Coroner Clay McMorris told the Daily Leader of Brookhaven. Mobley had made a few cuts on the tree and backed away when the trunk shifted before he could move, Deputy Coroner Ricky Alford said.

Two other people who were driving are being counted as storm-related deaths in Mississippi.

122,"Storm topples tree, kills 8-year-old Florida girl","File photo. Storms cause damage in the South.

WOODVILLE, Fla. - A storm system moving through the South is being blamed for the death of an 8-year-old girl in Florida.

The Leon County Sheriff's Office said a tree fell Friday into a house in Woodville, south of Tallahassee, killing the girl and injuring a 12-year-old boy.

The office said in a statement that the girl died at the hospital while the boy has non-life-threatening injuries. Their names weren't immediately released.

Much of Florida was being hit Friday by strong storms that were also creating a threat of tornadoes in parts of the Carolinas and Virginia.

Most of Central Florida was under a weather warning, including a tornado watch, due to the system.

As of early Friday afternoon, no serious reports of damage had been reported.

125,"A Cape Coral mother will spend Mother's Day by newborn's bedside in hospital, hoping for good news","This year, Mother's Day won't mean as much to Kathryn Zarrillo as Tuesday will.

For most others, the 14th will be just like any other regular day of the week. But for Zarrillo, it means finding out whether she can take her newborn son home after an extended hospital stay that kept them from their family in Cape Coral for nearly a month.

Zarrillo hasn't been able to return to her teaching job since her son's birth, and her husband has been working overtime for the city of Cape Coral to support their family while she stays with the baby at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. Their daughter, Liliana, has been at home with her father.

""Hopefully, we'll be getting some answers on Tuesday,"" Zarrillo said over the phone from the hospital room, where she spends every day and night by her baby's bedside.

Canio Zarrillo was born six weeks premature on Jan. 19. He had been diagnosed with a genetic disorder called Noonan syndrome prior to his birth, so Zarrillo knew he might come early.

""But it was still a complete surprise,"" Zarrillo said. ""One minute I'm laying my daughter down to bed. The next minute, I'm like 'oh, my water broke'.""

Since then, the mom and son have been in and out of hospitals, sometimes for extended stays and other times for follow-up treatments.

They had their first fun outing about a month ago, when they went to their friend's home for a pre-Easter egg hunt.

""Everything was fun. Everyone looked cute,"" Zarrillo said. ""We took some cute pictures.""

The next day, after feeding from a bottle in the morning – ""a big deal for Canio to have a bottle,"" Zarillo said – his breathing started to grow labored.

Then it stopped. His heart soon would follow suit.

The family rushed the baby to Golisano Children's Hospital of Southwest Florida, a 20-minute drive from their Cape Coral home.

""By the time we got there, he was already turning blue,"" Zarrillo said. ""That's where our journey really started. His first few months of life have just been crazy. It's been a lot for my little man.""

Noonan syndrome is a condition that affects many areas of the body. It is characterized by mildly unusual facial features, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

For Canio, the disorder has caused heart problems and unusual facial features.

When he went into cardiac arrest in mid-April, his heart's left ventricle collapsed. Doctors had to pump him full of fluid to get his heart beating the way it should, Zarrillo said.

Then Canio's body started retaining fluid, and tests indicated lymphatic problems.

""My little 9-pound son turned into at least double his size, if not triple within a matter of a day,"" she said.

They spent 10 days at the Southwest Florida hospital. On April 24, patches of Canio's skin started turning purple, Zarrillo said.

Doctors transferred him to the children's hospital on the east coast via a med flight. He's improved since then, achieving more normal fluid levels.

But the distance has been tough on the family, and especially on Zarrillo's daughter Liliana, who turns 3 next month, she said. The little girl wanted to hold her baby brother all the time when Zarrillo first brought him home, she said.

""What do you tell an almost 3-year-old that her little brother isn't home because there's something wrong with him?"" Zarrillo asked. ""We tell her he's at the hospital getting strong, but she can't go see him because she's too little.""

Zarrillo hasn't seen Liliana since April 24, she said.

""Not being able to see my little girl for so long has really pulled on my heart so much,"" Zarrillo said. ""This has been a big wait-and-see game. The waiting and the seeing is very, very, very, very draining. I can’t do anything except for hope the doctors are doing the best thing for my son.""

There is some light at the tunnel, she said.

She'll return home and back to work for the last day of school, where she'll see her fifth graders off as they prepare to transition into middle school, she said. And she'll plan a small birthday party for Liliana, with Minnie Mouse cupcakes.

A friend has set up a GoFundMe page to help the family with the mounting expenses as her husband works overtime to support the family on one salary.

And she keeps her favorite picture of Canio, taken the day before they went to the emergency room, hanging in his hospital room so everyone can see what he looked like before all the feeding tubes, fluid retention and skin discoloration. Zarrillo said the picture shows what ""normal"" looks like for him.

""We take each day as it comes. Some days we take each hour as it comes,"" Zarrillo said. ""Sometimes you've just got to take what you can when you can take it and be grateful for every little minute, because they count.""

Officials say two maintenance workers heard the baby crying and found her smudged with dirt in the trash bin. She was taken to a hospital and is expected to be fine.

The newborn baby weighs 6 pounds, 8 ounces and is now in the custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families.

Investigators haven't said what led them to Sousa.

In Florida, the Safe Haven Law allows parents to surrender their unharmed newborn, not more than a week old, at a police station, hospital or fire station without consequence. For more information about the Safe Haven Law, call 1-877-767-2229.

Tiffany Bannworth looks into the faces of her seven children and sees her husband.

They are all she has left of the man who'd been her life partner for nearly 20 years. Stephen Bannworth died in August in a Fort Myers motorcycle crash.

This Mother's Day, the Cape Coral mother will celebrate each of the boys they created and the miracle daughter born nine months after his death with a nice dinner and family outing.

""We're replacing a bad memory with remembrance of happiness and celebration,"" she said of the holidays and anniversaries since their lives upended.

The six boys look like their dad Stephen Bannworth at different stages of his life, she said, as she cradles his final gift in her arms.

Amunet Corencia Pearl Bannworth arrived on Good Friday. The 35-year-old mother gave her the moniker they'd decided upon if it was girl during a 2007 pregnancy, their third.

""He would recognize it anywhere,"" she said of their daughter's name. Amunet is the Egyptian goddess of mystery. She joins siblings Dante, Cairo, Jasper, Roman, Quinton and Kipling Bannworth. A seventh son, Gatsby Bannworth, died six years ago at 3 months old.

Oldest son Dante, 16, said last year started out ""great at first,"" the six boys and their parents taking weekend outings and enjoying their time with one another.

Then, his father's death abruptly changed their trajectory.

""Now it sucks because my dad wanted a girl,"" Dante Bannworth said, his father's prayers answered in death, only never to see her.

Stephen Bannworth was a stay-at-home dad. He and Tiffany met and courted, having Dante when Tiffany was 19. Stephen supported her dreams, saw her through college and her doctorate.

She is now executive director at Nicaea Academy of Southwest Florida, a birth through college education facility in Cape Coral. Amunet sleeps in her mother's office, all six boys always nearby, attending classes.

The family's closeness is no surprise. It's what Stephen Bannworth cultivated, Tiffany Bannworth said.

Tiffany and Stephen Bannworth were with each other every day — a streak of 3,992 of them — since Sept. 1, 2007, she said. If she went on a quick archaeology trip — one of her many interests and qualifications — she left Saturday morning and returned Sunday night, making sure they kissed good-bye and hello.

Tiffany, an only child, had always known Stephen wanted a big family.

The Bannworth family is nearly three times the size of the average family. The U.S. Census Bureau counted about 83.09 million families with an average of 3.14 persons in 2018, down from 3.7 in the 1960s.

Dante was the first baby Tiffany Bannworth ever held. Within weeks, she told Stephen she wanted more. Lots more.

Four years after Dante, the Bannworths had five more sons within six years.

Their sixth, Gatsby, died in his sleep three months after his birth.

""We thought that was the unthinkable,"" she said. But Stephen held the family together.

""He was so strong and cultivated a tight-knit family,"" she said. ""A part of our hearts were missing. He carried us through the grief.""

Within the year, son Kipling was born, and Stephen understood Tiffany's fears of losing another child.

""I was scared it could happen again,"" Tiffany Bannworth said. ""He said he would quit his job and watch Kipling until he went to school.""

He kept that promise: Kipling started kindergarten days after Stephen's death.

In the years between, Stephen Bannworth washed their clothes, cooked and cleaned and did all the home repairs himself.

""Some people thought he was just some schlub,"" she said. ""He was so incredible. He was more of a man than I could ever imagine meeting.""

Their passion lasted their entire marriage.

Over the summer, the family car needed replacing.

While waiting on a new vehicle to arrive last August, Stephen Bannworth would take Tiffany to work on the back of his motorcycle. He did so the Saturday before his death.

He would park across from the main building on campus and rev the engine as she walked across the lot.

""He'd blow kisses and wink,"" she said. ""I still got flustered. We were really love struck.""

She drove the new vehicle to school for the first time the morning he died. He had fixed the locks on the vehicle to prepare it for use the day before. He'd also repaired the curio cabinet glass, cleaned the house and washed every bit of laundry, not knowing he wouldn't return from his motorcycle ride.

She remembers the acute feeling of loss in the days after his death — she didn't have a single stitch of clothing remaining that carried his scent.

""The glaring absence of him was noticed by me,"" she said, adding she was in her bed, crying to God: ""Let me be pregnant with his last child.'""

Then, when her pregnancy was confirmed six weeks later, ""How blessed I felt. What a miracle it was.""

Friends, family and even strangers stepped up to help fill the void. A GoFundMe campaign raised more than $12,000; a woman linked to the Nicaea school paid for the entire funeral. Christmas came and people showered the family with gift cards.

People told her stories about how Stephen had helped them, without her ever knowing.

On the weekend that would have been their wedding anniversary, friends gathered to celebrate the couple. The next day, Tiffany Bannworth said, 50 people came to her baby shower.

On her birthday Tuesday, the school's students gathered around a store-bought birthday cake with the bright yellow icing, macaroons and doughnuts. Her sons surrounded her, Amunet on her lap, as everyone sang 'Happy Birthday.""

It's a new memory, to complement the other birthdays where Stephen would make any kind of cake she asked.

""It's difficult to be away from him,"" she said. ""There's never going to be another man like Steve.""

As Mother's Day loomed, she reflected on what she learned from the man she knew she could spend several lifetimes with and follow the example he set.

""He was very loving and doting and protective and very pure,"" she said. "" ... Co-parenting with him was a piece of cake.""

That they are a strong family and going through life together shows in how the brothers have welcomed Amunet.

""They are very protective of her,"" Tiffany Bannworth said, ""especially (Kipling). They don't want anybody to touch her.""

She will spend her Mother's Day, the first having a daughter, thinking about the man who helped her become a mom and making memories with the six versions of himself he left behind.

""This was a day that Stevie lavished me with gifts and attention,"" she said. He'd take the boys to a thrift store to look for antique glass.

""I have a big collection, but I refuse to spend a lot of money on it,"" she said. ""That used to bug Steve. He liked to buy me expensive things, but I liked the novelty of finding it for next to nothing.

""This year there will be none of that.""

She planned to cook a nice dinner on Saturday, inviting her mother to join them.

She cherishes the memories Stephen left her with, their last morning together and their final embrace.

""Boy, would I kill for another kiss from my husband,"" she said.

133,Girl's father confronts ice cream truck driver. What happens next?,"JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla. - An ice cream truck driver was arrested Tuesday evening after Jacksonville Beach police said he pushed a girl's father, resisted arrest and had marijuana in his ice cream truck.

According to police, the driver of the ice cream truck, 43-year-old Murat Tastan, was trying to get a girl to come to his vehicle near Seawalk Pavilion.

The 13-year-old girl’s father, who wished to remain anonymous, told News4Jax that she was there with other girls, participating in a gymnastics class, and he was sitting up against a tree nearby when it happened.

""At one point, I heard him play something over his microphone that said, 'Hey, baby.' It was in a baby's voice -- very creepy -- and then he whistled, so my daughter says, 'Hey, Dad. I’m a little bit worried,'"" he said.

The father told police that when he told Tastan to leave, the ice cream truck driver jumped out of his vehicle and aggressively approached him. He said Tastan bumped into his chest, knocking him backward, and cursed at him.

Police said that, when the first officer arrived, the officer saw Tastan try to go after the father again. When the officer tried to calm Tastan down, he resisted, according to an arrest report.

""It took that officer a few minutes. He requested backup because the guy was fighting with him. Another officer came. Then another officer came,"" the girl's father said. ""They finally got him to roll over and comply.""

Cellphone video shows the struggle between the ice cream truck driver and the officers as he continued to yell and move as police tried to handcuff him. Officers said they finally got Tastan to cooperate and placed him in handcuffs.

Tastan was arrested on charges of battery, resisting arrest without violence and possession of marijuana. Police said 2.2 grams of the drug were found inside the ice cream truck.

According to police, a special license is needed to operate an ice cream truck in Jacksonville Beach and Tastan hadn’t renewed his license since 2011.

Fernando Sola, another ice cream truck driver in the area, said not only do ice cream truck drivers need to be licensed, but they need to have a good attitude for the job.

""Police stop me all the time, even if they know me already, but they want to make sure every year that I have the license for Jacksonville Beach and I have all the papers. I have the insurance,"" Sola said. ""If you can’t be good with kids and you can’t be friendly with people, then you have to do something else.""

The 13-year-old’s father, as well as another man who witnessed Tuesday's incident, said they both were already concerned about Tastan, as they had each had other run-ins with him in the past. They said they hope Tastan's arrest will keep him away from the area.

The father said he is relieved he was there when the incident happened, so he could protect his daughter. But he added she's still shaken up.

Tastan, of Jacksonville, was released from the Duval County jail Wednesday on $4,500 bond, online jail records show. He is scheduled to be in court for arraignment at 9:30 a.m. May 22.

On Thursday, News4Jax went by to the address listed on the report for Tastan and a man said he had kicked Tastan out over a year ago because he wasn’t paying rent and that he is likely living out of his truck, which was impounded Tuesday evening.

135,Dericka Lindsay's adopted mom stands trial in her death,"Grace Smith suffered severe diabetes, and sometimes the 69-year-old's legs and feet got so swollen she couldn't wear shoes or walk around her own house.

In her condition, Smith was weaker than her 9-year-old adopted daughter, the woman's attorney said, and sometimes she asked for help keeping the ""unruly girl"" under control.

Smith never intended or imagined that her attempts at discipline would lead to the child's death, Smith's attorney argued in the first day of her trial Thursday.

Smith is charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child and aggravated child abuse in connection with the October 2017 death of Dericka Chavonne Lindsey, a young girl who suffocated when her 320-pound cousin, Veronica Posey, sat on her as a form of discipline.

Veronica Posey: Woman convicted of murder, sentenced to life for sitting on child

James Smith: Man sentenced in death of adopted 9-year-old who was sat on

In her opening statements to jurors Thursday, Assistant State Attorney Amy Shea said Posey was charged with murder for what she did to Dericka, but Smith was being charged because ""she failed to do her duty as a parent and protect her child from the abuse of another person.""

Shea said that before Dericka's death, the child had threatened Grace Smith and her husband, James, with a knife and a hammer. Smith called Posey over to her Navy Point home, and when she arrived both women spanked Dericka using a belt, a ruler and a small pipe.

When the girl resisted, she was made to kneel on the floor with her torso bent forward over the seat of an arm chair, and Posey put her weight on the girl's torso. A minute or two into the ""punishment,"" Dericka said she couldn't breathe, but Posey didn't move. A little while later Dericka repeated that she couldn't breathe, and Posey got up, but at that point Dericka had already lost her pulse.

A later autopsy revealed that Lindsey had severe bruising on her buttocks that appeared to be the result of severe, repeated beatings. The medical examiner said during Posey's trial that the bruising was the worst of its type she had ever seen.

Shea said the discipline meted out against Dericka ""goes far beyond what punishment is permitted by the law,"" and she noted that although Smith was frail, ""that doesn't stop her from beating that child, and it doesn't stop her from inviting (Posey's) abuse into her home.""

Case unfolds

Initial arrest: Pensacola child dies after 325-pound adult sat on her as punishment

Charges upgraded: State upgrades charges for 2 allegedly involved in child's punishment death

Autopsy: Lindsay had bruising, brain swelling after cousin allegedly sat on her

Additional charges: Three defendants face additional child abuse charge

Audio: 911 call released from Dericka Lindsay death

Smith's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Bradley Rowe, said that Smith and her husband had been caring for Dericka for most of the girl's life and they loved her dearly. But while the Smiths was getting older and weaker, Dericka was ""getting bigger, stronger and more defiant everyday,"" he said.

Rowe said the couple trusted Posey to help them discipline Dercika because she was an evangelical minister who had children of her own, and sometimes she was able to get the 9-year-old to behave just by using the right words.

Remembering Dericka

► Community gathers to honor, remember girl allegedly killed by cousin

► Dericka Lindsay's school installs 'buddy bench' after 9-year-old's alleged abuse death

► Dericka Lindsay death: Parents, friends say girl with troubled home life was happy, bubbly

When she did resort to corporal punishment, the Smiths never thought Dericka would come to any real harm, Rowe suggested. He said the incident involving Posey and the chair happened so quickly that the Smiths didn't understand the tragic consequences until it was already too late.

""(Posey did not sit on Dericka) at the direction, encouragement, recommendation or order of Grace (Smith),"" Rowe told jurors. ""... She loved her daughter. She didn't want her daughter to die.""

Smith's trial is expected to wrap up Friday.

James Smith, who was also charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child, plead no contest to his charges and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. A jury convicted Posey of first-degree murder, and she was issued the mandatory life sentence for her role in the death.

136,Police: Stepfather of missing girl changed story,"HOUSTON (AP) — The Latest on the search for a 4-year-old girl who was reported missing in Houston (all times local):

7:30 p.m.

Police in a suburb of Houston say a Texas man who reported his 4-year-old stepdaughter missing Saturday repeatedly changed his story during initial interviews.

Houston police say Darion Vence told investigators Maleah Davis was abducted more than 24-hours earlier by men in a pickup truck who knocked him out but then let him and his 2-year-old son go.

But Vence was first interviewed by Sugar Land police, and a spokesman for that city’s department says his account “changed several times.”

Houston police are leading the investigation. They say it is ongoing and that they don’t identify “persons of interest or suspects unless charges are filed.”

A phone message requesting comment left at a number listed for Vence was not immediately returned.

Sugar Land is about 22 miles (35.4 kilometers) southwest of Houston.

___

2:30 p.m.

A 4-year-old Houston girl who has been missing since her stepfather reported she was abducted had previously been removed from her home by state workers concerned about allegations of physical abuse.

Officials with state Child Protective Services in Houston say Maleah Davis was removed from her home in August after she suffered a head injury and was then returned to the home in February. Her two brothers also were removed over that period. All three were placed with relatives.

CPS caseworkers have been monitoring the home since the children were returned.

Searchers are looking for the girl after her stepfather reported he stopped their vehicle Friday night to check a tire when the men pulled up behind them.

144,Budget leads major issues in Florida Legislature's final week,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - The Florida Legislature careens into its final scheduled week with a host of major issues still to be settled, including a roughly $90 billion state budget that is the only bill lawmakers are required to pass.

House Speaker Jose Oliva said an agreement on the budget should be reached by Tuesday, giving legislators the required 72-hour “cooling off” period to read and digest it before a final vote. Friday is the scheduled end of the 60-day legislative session.

“We’re on time. We like the position we’re in now,” said Oliva, a Miami Lakes Republican.

As in any other year, most bills filed by lawmakers will wither away. But there are several high-profile issues that have passed either the House or Senate and must be reconciled before they can be sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis to become law.

One of those is the “sanctuary cities” bill that would require local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal authorities on detaining undocumented immigrants and ban local governments from enacting policies that would protect them. The House has passed its version but compromise with the Senate remains elusive.

Other big-ticket items yet to be finalized or discarded include: creating a new private school voucher program, authorizing a Canadian prescription drug importation program, permitting more classroom teachers to carry weapons, implementing a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights for most ex-felons, making texting while driving a primary traffic offense, beginning to build three major toll highways in rural areas, allowing hemp to become a crop and requiring parental consent for a minor girl to get an abortion.

In other words, welcome to the final week of the Legislature.

The one major accomplishment so far is a measure that allows smokable forms of medical marijuana, which DeSantis signed into law in March. That aligned state law with a constitutional amendment passed overwhelmingly by voters in 2016 and overturned a law signed in 2017 by then-Gov. Rick Scott that prohibited smoking medical weed.

Oliva said sometimes it takes legislators a while to come around on major issues. The texting and driving ban bill, for example, seems simple given the plague of distracted driving crashes, but many African American lawmakers worry it could be used by law enforcement officers to disproportionately stop drivers of color.

“That’s another one that has taken a long time to kind of mature because of the challenge of who will be pulled over and giving authorities another reason to pull people over,” the speaker said.

One potential last-minute issue is whether Florida will renew its revenue-sharing compact with the Seminole Tribe, which has paid the state $350 million a year in return for exclusive rights to certain forms of gambling. The current compact expires May 31 and lawmakers aren’t counting on the money this year, but Senate President Bill Galvano said it’s possible a new agreement will be reached between DeSantis and the tribe after meetings Friday.

“At the end of the day, it is up to him to make the agreement with the Seminole Tribe but we have a role of ratification,” said Galvano, a Bradenton Republican. “These things take time. Any movement is positive.”

The budget talks, as usual, focus on big multibillion-dollar things like public education, health care, the environment and criminal justice — but they also include a myriad of smaller items, such as whether to allow the Visit Florida tourism office to expire in October under current law. The Senate has voted to reauthorize it, but lawmakers so far have agreed only to provide $19 million for the upcoming year, enough to allow it to close up shop.

DeSantis sought full funding of $76 million. The Senate initially suggested $50 million, while the House was adamant about only the minimal amount. Oliva, however, seems resigned to keeping the office alive another year, mainly because the governor wants it.

“The governor’s office has expressed a desire to have it continue to go forward so that he would have the opportunity to make an assessment of his own of how unnecessary it is,” the speaker said. “I don’t know about fully funding it.”

Dozens of other items will be caught up in the final week’s budget scramble, and DeSantis has line-item veto authority once it is passed. One thing he might want to keep is a nearly $4 million appropriation for a new state airplane to replace the hand-me-down one the governor currently uses.

The new budget will take effect July 1.

WALTON COUNTY, Fla.- A Panama City man is arrested in Walton County after soliciting who he thought was a 14-year-old girl, for sex.

26 year-old Christopher Jackson Jr. engaged with an undercover officer through a social media account depicting a 14-year-old female.

Reports said during the exchange, Jackson got increasingly sexual in nature and asked for nude pictures.

He also indicated through his chats that he wanted to have sex with the juvenile. Jackson is charged with two counts of using a computer to solicit a child for sex and traveling to meet a minor for sex, both felonies in the state of Florida.

He's been booked into the Walton County jail.

156,East Ridge teacher charged with fondling student,"CLERMONT — A teacher at East Ridge High School was arrested Friday after his former students reported that he groped them repeatedly.

Detectives launched an investigation into geometry and musical theater teacher Jason Misner after students alleged he had touched some of them inappropriately. According to one girl, Misner managed to get her alone under the guise of offering her after-school vocal lessons. He allegedly allowed the girl, who was 17 at the time, to use his car and talked to her about her sex life. Eventually, she told police, he began touching her legs, buttocks, breasts and genitals.

Misner reportedly admitted to detectives that he touched the girl under her clothes but said it was necessary in order to monitor her breathing during vocal lessons.

Sheriff's detectives say they were able to obtain warrants for 19 counts of battery against that one victim, but that other students claimed he engaged them in sexually explicit conversations and offered to buy one girl underwear and give her a massage.

By definition, battery is unwanted touching by another individual. Sheriff's spokesman John Herrell said they didn't charge Misner with sexual battery because the crimes didn't involve penetration. And they couldn't charge him with a crime against a minor because under Florida law, a 17-year-old is not considered a minor in a sex crime.

East Ridge High School acted on the allegations as soon as they got word, Lake County School District officials said.

""The allegations were brought to our attention last week,"" said Sherri Owens, school district spokeswoman. ""Mr. Misner was immediately reassigned into a position where he had no student contact. We are cooperating fully with the investigation.""

Owens said he took a leave of absence after he was reassigned, so he wasn't working as a teacher at the time of his arrest.

Misner had worked as a math teacher at the school from 2010 to 2014 and then was reassigned to teach music.

Misner surrendered to police without incident and was booked on a $19,000 bond.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190510/east-ridge-teacher-charged-with-fondling-student?rssfeed=true,2019-05-10T14:01:52Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748

161,Community baby shower in Immokalee offers support to expectant moms,"Marie O. Jean is expecting her first child, a baby girl she can't wait to dress up and do girly things with.

She considers it a gift being able to have a baby, especially because she knows women who have wanted to but whose bodies couldn’t.

Jean, 25, has a way with children. She has worked with kids in one form or another since she was a teenager and is currently a tutor at the Boys & Girls Club in Immokalee.

“Kids have always been exciting for me,” Jean said.

While she’s eager to welcome her little girl this summer, she realized she had some unexpected things to learn about motherhood.

Jean and more than 30 other expectant mothers attended the 4th annual community baby shower at the Immokalee Boys & Girls Club on Thursday. They received information from more than a dozen organizations offering various social services and resources to moms in Immokalee.

The community baby shower, organized through a partnership between the Florida State University Center for Child Stress and Health in Immokalee and Healthy Start of Southwest Florida, is offered to low-income women and migrant workers, many of whom receive medical services through the Healthcare Network of Southwest Florida and mental health services from the FSU clinic.

“The main goal is to provide education and information for moms,” said Rosa Martinez, the event organizer and outreach coordinator for the FSU center. “And some of these women will never have a baby shower of their own.”

The moms got to pick out clothes for their children and left the baby shower with essentials and gifts — diapers, baby wipes, teething rings, toys, Pack 'n Plays, strollers, car seats, medical kits. A few women left with bigger raffle items like a rocking chair and a crib.

A certified car seat technician from Golisano Children’s Hospital of Southwest Florida taught the parents about child passenger safety and stressed the importance of correctly installing car seats to protect children during crashes.

Dr. Adriana Ziemba with the Healthcare Network of Southwest Florida talked to the women in Spanish and English about the importance of self-care during and after their pregnancies.

She encouraged them to exercise, dance, play music, talk to friends and family, take walks, watch funny videos online or any other activity that could help ease the stresses of motherhood.

She emphasized the importance of taking care of not just their bodies, but their minds. Ziemba talked about some of the psychological symptoms women can experience during and after childbirth — sadness, crying, irritability, anger, frustration. She talked to them about postpartum depression and implored them to get help if they experienced serious psychological symptoms for too long. She told them suicidal thoughts are an emergency.

“We don’t want you to suffer in silence,” Ziemba told the women. “ ... Self-care also means getting help and asking for help.”

Jean said she didn’t know about car seat safety. She also didn’t know about postpartum depression.

She said her pregnancy has been healthy and relatively symptom-free. She has a good support system with her group of friends and family. She turns to them or does research when she’s uncertain about something or when she doesn’t feel well. She said she would seek help if she experiences symptoms of postpartum depression now that she knows about it.

For right now, Jean, a cosmetologist, awaits the July arrival of her baby girl and dreams about owning a beauty salon.

She can’t wait for her “little mini-me” to be at her side when that dream becomes a reality.

165,"DCPS officer, his stepfather face child sex charges involving same girl","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A police lieutenant with Duval County Public Schools who was arrested Tuesday is facing child sex charges for an incident involving a young girl, News4Jax has learned.

As if that wasn't disturbing enough, the Michigan Attorney General's Office said the man's stepfather is facing the same charges -- involving the same child.

Authorities did not release the child's exact age or her relationship to the two men.

Lt. Sean MacMaster, 45, is charged with two counts of criminal conduct with a child, which is a first-degree felony. He was taken into custody on the out-of-state arrest warrant at the Duval County School Police Department. He was set to go before a judge Wednesday afternoon.

MacMaster's stepfather, Larry Orr, who is a registered sex offender in Michigan, is facing the same charges. He was arraigned in Oakland County Superior Court on Thursday and is being held without bond.

A statement from a Duval County Public Schools spokesperson reads in part:

We have received notification that an employee with the Duval County School Police Department, Lt. Sean MacMaster, was arrested (Tuesday) morning on an out of state warrant. The charges are not related to the school district or any student in the district. However, the district is closely monitoring this situation. The individual is currently in custody. Should he be released from custody, he will not have any contact with students pending the outcome of an internal investigation.

It wasn't immediately clear which school MacMaster worked at.

A woman who was at the home of MacMaster's listed address told News4Jax, ""We don't have any comment.""

170,Documents detail 'severe injuries' in abuse of toddler; two face charges,"Clayton Pafford is one of two people charged in connection with the abuse of a toddler who suffered ""severe injuries."" The girl's mother, Heather Reid was also arrested. (Photo: Leon County Detention Facility)

The mother of a 2-year-old girl noticed injuries to her child every time she left her alone with her live-in boyfriend.

Leon County Sheriff’s Office investigators were made aware Monday of a possible child abuse incident when the girl was transported to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare with severe injuries.

Her brain was bleeding in two places. She had liver lacerations. Both her ears were bruised. She had cuts and abrasions on her hip, face and arms.

The girl’s mother, 26-year-old Heather Reid, was arrested after being questioned by detectives. She faces charges of child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm.

She told detectives she heard a thud come from the other room and believed the girl had fallen out of bed. After answering that only she and another man were at the house, she backtracked and said that her boyfriend, Clayton Pafford, was also home.

Heather Reid, 26, was arrested on charges of child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm. (Photo: Leon County Detention Facility)

She said Monday was not the first time she noticed the child with injuries.

“She noticed every time she leaves (her) alone with Clayton, she would return home and discover more injuries,” according to court records.

Reid said she didn't report previous injuries she believed were connected with Pafford because she was worried the toddler would be taken by the Florida Department of Children and Families.

The friend told LCSO he heard the same thud but that Reid wasn’t at the Crossway Court house when it happened. He saw Pafford, 23, come out of a bedroom with the toddler’s, bloody limp body. Pafford began calling Reid instead of for medical help.

The friend called 911 as Pafford left the home saying, “Don’t tell anyone I was here.”

Pafford, 23, was arrested Tuesday after leading law enforcement officials on a chase through Woodville. He faces charges of child neglect, aggravated battery on a child, kidnapping, hitting a police dog, aggravated assault of a police officer and multiple other charges stemming from fleeing officers.

LCSO deputies, along with members of the U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force and the Florida Highway Patrol, searched for Pafford all night. He was finally located at about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday driving on Back Forest Road by a member of LCSO’s Special Projects Investigations Detection Enforcement Response Unit and members of the Florida Highway Patrol. When they tried to stop him, Pafford refused to stop and fled.

Persuing deputies and troopers used stop sticks in the southbound travel lane of Old Woodville Highway, but Pafford swerved toward the deputy onto the St. Marks bike trail, narrowly missing him. Pafford turned back onto Old Woodville Highway and crossed over Bob Miller Road before troopers were able to stop his vehicle, LCSO reported.

Pafford, who had a passenger in his vehicle, refused to surrender. A LCSO K9 was used to take him into custody and after being treated at a local hospital was taken to the Leon County Detention Facility.

The couple was investigated by DCF last month when hospital staff noticed the toddler’s injuries.

In mid-April, staff at Capital Regional Medical Center noticed the girl was dirty, was covered in bug bites, had a bruise under her left eye and a bald spot on her head. The girl had a burn on her right hand and lesions on her body.

Staff members overheard Reid making alarming statements about not being able to take care of the girl and not caring if she was eating.

174,10-year-old Florida girl is attacked by shark on her birthday,"A little girl experienced a shark attack in Florida and walked away with 40 stitches. Her parents say she is ready to get back to the beach and swim in the ocean.

When a 10-year-old was swimming in the ocean at Crescent Beach near Daytona, her parents thought she might’ve been stung by a jellyfish. But she was actually attacked by a shark, News4Jax reported.

According to the report, Peyton Shields shoved the shark when it bit both her legs. It then got a hold of her arm and bit her there. As she continued shoving, the shark swam away.

Her father was surprised the attack occurred.

""My daughter got bitten by a shark. It's, like, I don't know anybody who has been bitten by a shark. Lucky Peyton."" Steve Shields, Peyton's father, told News4Jax.

Both of Peyton’s parents put pressure on the bite wounds and called 911. Soon after, she was taken to Flagler Hospital. She left the hospital with 40 stitches and continued celebrating her birthday a few days later.

Peyton Shields is already looking forward to her next beach trip. “The shark’s gone. I’m ready to get back in,” Peyton told her father. Steve Sheilds says his daughter is brave.

""We live in Florida. There’s sharks. There’s alligators. We’re going to go swim in the lake. We’re going to swim in the ocean. It is what it is,” Steve said.

175,A tea for Mom,"VALPARAISO — The Heritage Museum of Northwest Florida gave mothers the opportunity to relax, have fun and experience an authentic Victorian tea Saturday.

The museum hosted its annual Mother’s Day Victorian Tea under tents set up in the museum’s garden, which is managed by the Valparaiso Garden Club.

Kathryn Wene, the museum's education coordinator, said this was the first year they have held the tea in the garden.

“We usually have it in the blue room, but we wanted to try something different this year,” Wene said. “It’s meant to be a nice event where people can come and get dressed up.”

Marie Hallion, one of the museum’s trustees, said the museum has been hosting the Mother’s Day tea for five years.

“It just sounded like a fun thing to do for Mother’s Day,” she said. “We do try to make it as close to the traditional tea that you would find in England.”

Sandwiches, scones, fruit tarts, and petit fours were served on fine china at each table. Teapots of various teas were continuously poured throughout the hour and a half event.

Wene said the food came from the Niceville Publix and was as similar as you could get to what would be served at a traditional Victorian tea.

About 30 people attended the event. Kristine Gonzales brought her mom as a surprise.

“She likes to go to tea houses, so she invited me for Mother’s Day,” said Janet Gonzales, Kristine’s mother. “I knew we were coming to a tea house but I didn’t know anything more.”

June Scroggin attended solo, but said the tea made her feel like she was closer to her daughter.

“My daughter lives in England and we love Jane Austen and tea parties,” she said. “I’m missing my baby girl right now, so I decided to sign up and see what was happening.”

Hallion said the Mother’s Day tea always sells out, and this year was no exception.

“I am just thrilled to see so many mothers and their loved ones here,” she said.",https://www.crestviewbulletin.com/news/20190511/tea-for-mom?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T16:24:07Z,Crestview News Bulletin,Couple,"638 N Ferdon Blvd, Crestview, FL 32536, USA",FL,32536

'Time to focus on solutions'

I'm writing to express my disappointment about Congressman Posey's ""no"" vote for H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act. I also urge him to co-sponsor H.R. 763, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. Both are important actions our nation can take to reverse human-induced climate change and global warming.

I applaud the congressman for cosponsoring a bill calling for research on ocean acidification and its effects on the lagoon. That's good. However, with recent warnings from international climate scientists about the acceleration of global warming, it seems time to focus on solutions as well as more research. It also is well past the time for Posey publicly to say that climate change is caused by humans and that climate change causes ocean acidification. Carbon dioxide, when dissolved in water, produces carbonic acid. The slight change in pH level that results is harmful to many living organisms in the ocean and in coastal water bodies, like the Indian River Lagoon which Posey has worked to restore.

Educator sees hope, not hate

Thank you to Thomas Grotelueschen for writing his dissent of the recent statement by Florida Sen. Joe Gruters, who said, “No one is born with hate in their heart. And the fact that a 19-year-old having spent 13 years going to school and emerged with it shows our education system has failed.”

I have taught high school juniors and seniors who are dual-enrolled at Eastern Florida State College for several years — including the recent semester — and after reading Gruters’ article, I asked the students what they thought. They were very surprised. They told me he doesn’t know what he’s writing about. I have a 14-year-old girl in my Sunday school class who attends a local public high school, and she too became very surprised and also angry that anyone would think that was the case. She said someone should invite him to a public high school class for a few days or a week — or longer — and then see what he thinks.

Whether we are elementary, middle school, high school, or college instructors, we are trained to engage students in critical thinking — which is defined as “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment.” This definition should apply, not only to teachers, but to those who are elected officials as well.

Regarding the first line of Gruters’ statement, “No one is born with hate in their hearts,” Christian doctrine states clearly that we are all born sinful.

If it had been Obama ...

Imagine that there was a Justice Department special counsel investigation of a foreign nation’s interference into a US presidential election. According to an April 18 ABC News summary, this investigation resulted in more than 2,500 subpoenas, nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communications records, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence and interviewed nearly 500 witnesses.

This investigation resulted in 34 people and three foreign (Russian) entities indicted, six associates of this president charged, 26 Russians indicted, seven guilty pleas, four prison sentences and one person found guilty at trial. On top of this, there was substantial evidence that this president ordered the head of the investigation be fired in order to end the investigation.

This investigation did not however, result in a legal case that will be brought against the president despite 22 months of a special counsel inquiry and ample evidence of obstruction of justice. The reason given was that our Justice Department has a long-standing policy against indicting a sitting president. The special counsel simply turned the final report to the Congress to determine if further action is warranted.

Now, imagine this was a report about President Barack Obama. What do you think Congress should do?

Hardy Moore, Merritt Island

Time to talk impeachment?

President Trump came out last week saying “we’re fighting all the subpoenas”, and any request for information or testimony directed at the White House and staff. Even saying they will somehow bar former White House legal counsel, Don McGahn from testifying.

Attorney General Barr recently sat before Congress and basically said it doesn’t matter what special counsel Robert Mueller wrote in his report. Or what Mueller wrote in a follow-up letter, saying Barr ""did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions.” Barr told Congress that Mueller’s letter was ""snitty."" Proving Mueller's concern that Barr “threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.” Barr defiantly skipped a House hearing the next day.

Donald Trump and William Barr took the oath to defend the Constitution, including the rule of law, separation of powers and the right of congressional oversight. Not to fight it.

Article III of the articles of impeachment for Richard Nixon alleged that Nixon ""failed, without lawful cause or excuse, to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas.""

Trump and Barr seem to be daring the House to start drafting articles of impeachment, if for nothing less than willfully disobeying authorized congressional and constitutional oversight requests. Congress should do the work of the people, and take that dare.

177,Kimberly Kessler asks about death penalty in jailhouse call,"NASSAU COUNTY, Fla. - Jailhouse phone calls that Kimberly Kessler, the woman charged with killing her co-worker Joleen Cummings, made after she was arrested last year were obtained Friday by News4Jax.

Kessler, 50, discusses complains jail conditions in a couple of the calls, but in the first one, she asks about the death penalty.

Kessler: “Florida and Texas, are those the only two states with the death penalty?”

Caller: “I don’t know, I haven’t done the research on that. You might want to YouTube that and get back to me on it.”

Kessler: “Yeah, I don’t think I’d want to know and then tell you bad news. I thought someone said they weren’t doing that anymore, and they shouldn’t do it anymore because the dumb***** get everything wrong.""

The release of the calls comes ahead of Mother's Day weekend, which marks one year since Cummings, a 34-year-old mother of three, disappeared.

Investigators suspect Kessler, who worked with Cummings at Tangles hair salon in Yulee, was the last person to see Cummings alive.

Following Cummings’ disappearance, her SUV was found parked outside a Home Depot. Kessler was arrested May 16, 2018, after investigators said they found footage showing her getting out of the vehicle and booked into the Nassau County jail, where she went on a hunger strike that prompted her to later be moved to the Duval County jail.

It's unclear at which jail the calls were made from, but she complains about the treatment in the jail in two of them.

“My attorney told me he has no control over them. They mistreat me. That’s just how it is, basically. He didn’t say it exactly in those words. That’s my interpretation of it. So I’m surprised they let me call you. Perhaps they were looking to listen to a fascinating conversation in between us. I don’t know why they let me call you, but they did. He said they should let me call him whenever I want, and they didn’t, they didn’t let me do it. They make excuses, like, ‘Oh we’re busy,’ then shut the door and walk away. It’s kind of funny they keep me in solitary confinement, like, it’s a bad thing,"" Kessler said with a laugh in one jailhouse call. ""It’s heaven, girl.”

In another call, Kessler, who went by Jennifer Sybert, talks about wanting out of jail. Authorities said she has used 17 aliases over the years.

Kessler: “Bail me out under my name that I’m going under, which is Jennifer Marie Sybert. And then eventually everything’s going to come together, but, with my real name Kim Kessler. But you know, go about it, jump through the hoops.”

Person on the other end of the call: “OK. You said bail you out under Jennifer?""

Kessler: “Yeah, because that’s how they arrested me under. Until the FBI corrects it, it’s gonna be Jennifer.”

Other person: “The FBI? Oh, my God, they won’t correct.“

Kessler: “They will. You just put the money up as Jennifer Marie Sybert. I gave you my Social, by date of birth the name, my name my alias or whatever that I’ve been living under for 19 years. You’re all set.”

Other person: “Oh, my God. Are you warm, sleeping alright? They gave you a blanket?”

Kessler: “Of course not. It’s terrible. I’m in jail. It’s very, very bad.""

Other person: “It would be nice if they treated you the way they would want to be treated.”

Kessler: “Well, if you really want to help come and get me out. So, that would be great.”

Kessler is now charged with first-degree murder in Cummings’ death. The day after she was indicted on Sept. 7, she discusses how unexpected the indictment was during a call.

“I didn’t expect it to come, but I was… I guess it was always in the back of my mind because I knew they were crazy like that, because they did it to me before. I don’t know. I guess I got too trusting, like, I thought their BS was over. Tom Townsend (her lawyer) told me today that I was on the front page of the newspaper, I’m all over the news. He said they had a bunch of people call the public defender’s office -- Newsline or Dateline called, a bunch of entities or whatever, like news channels, were calling today. I was (like), 'Really?’ He said, 'They were all calling. You’re all over the newspaper, all over the news.' And I was, like, 'Really?’” she can be heard saying in the call.

A year later, Cummings’s body has not been found, despite an extensive search at a Georgia landfill that turned up items of interest.

Since then, the state has released reams of evidence in the case through the discovery process that suggest a struggle occurred at the salon and that steps were taken to dispose of that evidence.

(Bryant Police Department) Snapshot of the Byrant High School 2019 yearbook, featuring K-9 school resource officer, Mya. (Bryant Police Department)

- One photo in an Arkansas high school's yearbook is a clear standout from the rest — that of K-9 school resource officer, Mya.

The Bryant Police Department shared a photo of the school yearbook on their Facebook page, congratulating very good girl Mya on her hard work, writing, “Good job Mya, you are representing the PD with pride...Hornet Pride!!!”

The nearly 3-year-old Belgian Malinois is wrapping up her first year as a K-9 school resource officer for the Bryant School District. She works alongside Sgt. Paul Tarvin primarily as a narcotics dog, but she is also trained for tracking and article recovery.

From the looks of her yearbook photo, Mya has very much enjoyed her job as school resource officer.

Mya is clearly loved by the Bryant community, as evidenced by the many adoring comments on the police department's post of her yearbook photo.

“My son wanted to show me his 'favorite staff member' when he brought his yearbook home!! I think this is great!!” one parent wrote.

Another commented, “And the kids love it! That was the first thing my daughter wanted to show me in her yearbook!!”

Asher is now facing seventeen charges of lewd and lascivious molestation and conduct. During an interview with detectives, Asher told them he knew what he was doing was wrong.

“Feel how I feel. It's a wrong thing. It is a wrong thing,” Asher told deputies who were interrogating him.

“You touched so many students you don't even know, don't even remember,"" the detective said to Asher at one point, ""you're trying to think, oh, which girl spoke up? That's what it seems like.""

INDIANTOWN — An Indiantown man is accused of sexually battering a 5-year-old girl multiple times and molesting a 13-year-old girl, sheriff's deputies said.

Hermenegildo Salvador-Lopez, 27, of the 14500 block of Southwest Martin Avenue in Indiantown, was charged Thursday with sexually battering the 5-year-old.

Salvador-Lopez was already in the Martin County Jail prior to Thursday's charge. He was arrested in April on a charge of lewd and lascivious molestation on a child younger than 16 from an incident that happened in October, deputies said.

Martin County sheriff's deputies said in April the girl, who is now 16, told deputies Salvador-Lopez had touched her inappropriately multiple times when she was younger.

""It's something that I have to live with,"" the girl told deputies when talking about what Salvador-Lopez had done.

The 16-year-old also told deputies the touching continued until she was 12. At that time, she kicked him and threatened to tell her mother.

The 16-year-old told deputies Salvador-Lopez told her no one would believe her and that God would blame her for letting this happen.

The other teen told deputies Salvador-Lopez touched her inappropriately and refused to stop when she asked him.

Salvador-Lopez remained in the Martin County Jail with a $550,500 bond.

191,Real Holocaust victim's life 'relived' as millennial on Instagram,"Railway tracks leading to the main gates at Auschwitz II - Birkenau. (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images)

“It’s 1944, and Nazis have conquered most of Europe … They do terrible things to us Jews … I’m about to turn 13 — finally.”

If that wasn’t a common diary entry for every pre-teen Jewish girl during World War II, it was for Eva Heyman, and the creator of a new Instagram account is determined to show what Eva's life was really like, in a way that her peers now could relate to: through Instagram.

Many of us are familiar with Anne Frank, but Eva was also a real person who endured the tragic life of being a Jew in the 1940s.

She began journaling her life on her 13th birthday, Feb. 13, 1944. She died on Oct. 17, 1944, as one of six million Jews killed at the hands of Nazis in the Holocaust.

An Israeli tech executive, Mati Kochavi, created the Instagram account as an innovative way of getting millennials who are attached to their phones and social media to engage in Holocaust education as the last of the survivors are dying out, according to The New York Times.

Kochavi and his daughter, Maya, created the project that went live on Israel’s annual Holocaust Martyrs’ and Heroes’ Remembrance Day.

In 70 short episodes, Eva, played by a British actress, takes followers with her on her Holocaust journey. And these are based on real entries from a real diary by a real girl.

We witness Eva, through the Instagram posts, go from a happy, imaginative and fun-loving young woman to a scared, lost and hopeless girl.

She talks about her crush and wanting to be a news photographer when she grows up.

Then, as she and her best friend are playing one day, before things get really bad, a man walks past them, spits on the ground and mumbles, ""Dirty Jew.""

""I'm surrounded by war, but I'm always seeing the sun."" -- Eva

As we begin nearing the end of Eva's journey, once the Nazis begin to take over her community, her tone changes drastically.

“You are so lucky that you cannot feel what terrible things are happening to us ... I so much want to live,” she says as she cries.

In her last post, Eva is put on a train to Auschwitz.

The project then ends with a glimpse into the life and death of the real Eva Heyman.

Kochavi's project has received a ton of support, including an endorsement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and plenty of Instagram followers (there were 1.6 million followers of the page as of Tuesday).

""What a great idea. 👏 Thank you for this. I am a teacher in Germany and will bring that to my students,"" one Instagram user said.

And another responded to one of the posts, ""I think this is great idea to ensure also the younger generations remembers the holocaust!!!""

But the project has not come without criticism.

Some Israelis say the use of “selfie culture” and the use of hashtags and emojis to try to simulate life during the Holocaust is cheapening and trivializing that period of history.

Regardless, Kochavi said he spent several million dollars on the project because the Holocaust needs attention from today's youth.

“The memory of the Holocaust outside of Israel is disappearing,” Kochavi said in an interview with The New York Times. “We thought, 'Let’s do something really disruptive.' We found the journal and said, ‘Let’s assume that instead of pen and paper, Eva had a smartphone and documented what was happening to her.’ So we brought a smartphone to 1944.”

After searching through about 30 young people's journals from the Holocaust, Kochavi and his daughter chose to tell Eva's story because of something very ""modern and relatable"" to her.

""I have no doubt in my mind that young people around the world want to have serious content and be connected in the right way,” he said.

ORLANDO, Fla. - Law enforcement officers and other first responders across Central Florida are going beyond the call of duty each week and our team at News 6 loves to share the ways they're getting results in their communities.

Whether it is to crime victims and their families, to animals in need or to each other, our first responders are always lending a helping hand.

This week, they had some help from awesome children and a few adorable animals.

[RELATED: Think Central Florida first responders only handle crime? You thought wrong | How first responders connect with Central Florida community]

You probably wouldn't think fighting crime could be cute -- that is, until you met K-9s Buddy and Zara, the newest additions to the Port Orange Police Department. Officers shared their adorable pictures to the department's Facebook page, officially welcoming the golden retrievers to the narcotics detection team. If we had to rate them, they'd get two paws up from us.

Two Maryland boys' trip to Disney got even more magical when they got to meet two Orange County deputies. The four posed for a picture outside Epcot, which the Orange County Sheriff's Office later posted on Twitter, saying it's always fun to meet Central Florida's visitors.

Our deputies are always thrilled to meet our visitors!

We're so glad they stopped by to say hello! pic.twitter.com/MP69O4hBLB — Orange County Sheriff's Office (@OrangeCoSheriff) May 2, 2019

Would it have been firefighter day without celebratory cupcakes? Two young girls in Brevard County didn't think so, which is why they stopped by the Fire Rescue station to drop off some treats to some of Brevard's bravest. What a sweet way to show their appreciation.

We often see first responders saving ducks from drains, but their bird-rescuing skills got even more impressive when St. Cloud Fire Rescue firefighters saved an owl with a broken wing that was stuck in a tree. Pictures posted to the department's Facebook page show crews working carefully to pull off the rescue. Thanks to them, the owl was handed over to animal control to undergo rehabilitation for the deformity to its wing that kept it from flying. Good luck, little hoot.

In Orange County, a 10-year-old girl worked bear-y hard to make a difference in her community. Because she remembered how intimidating it could be the first time a child is transported in an emergency vehicle, she collected hundreds of stuffed animals and donated them to the Orange County Fire Rescue Department to keep on their rescue and medic units so they can comfort others. Department members were so impressed by her gesture, they gave her a shoutout on Twitter.

10 year old Bella remembers her 1st ride in a rescue. So she wanted to give comfort to other kids who may find themselves being transported. Bella collected 375 stuffed animals, which she donated to us to place on all our rescue & medic units.

New York City firefighters were in the process of extinguishing a car fire Sunday night when they discovered someone alone inside -- a 3-year-old child.Police and firefighters responded to a 911 report of a vehicle on fire just before 9 p.m. The car was parked in a residential Queens neighborhood, just minutes away from John F. Kennedy International Airport. While fighting the flames, firefighters got the toddler out of the burning vehicle, but the child died of her injuries at Jamaica Hospital in Queens. The New York City Medical Examiner will determine the official cause of death, according to NYPD Detective Annette Shelton.The New York Post and The New York Times have reported that the girl was strapped into her car seat in the back and the rear doors had been chained shut.The girl's biological father was discovered a short distance away, in a nearby pond attempting to put out flames on his body, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN.Police took Martin Pereira into custody and emergency responders took him to an area hospital in serious but stable condition. Although he suffered burns all over his body, he is expected to survive, according to the law enforcement source.Pereira and the child's mother were in the midst of a custody battle, according to the law enforcement source. Both had filed domestic incident reports against the other person, the source said.The girl's mother, Cherone Coleman, told the New York Daily News that Pereira had become increasingly unhinged in recent weeks. Despite her fears, a judge ordered Pereira to take their 3-year-old daughter Zoey to his home last weekend. “I should’ve just kept her and gone to jail,” Coleman told the Daily News.She claimed Pereira had told her, ""You’ll never see your daughter again,"" before the incident.

204,"After addiction and loss, Seminole mother finds strength in family, customs and herself","Every time Dakota Osceola hit rock bottom, she had the will to get back up and a mom who stood by her with outstretched hands — no judgment, no shaming, no ultimatums.

Through years of Dakota’s drug addiction, rehab treatments, depression, the overdose deaths of her friends, relapses and unhealthy relationships, Tina Marie Osceola was there — a stable, determined force of tough love and support for her daughter regardless of the circumstances and decisions that led her girl down an agonizing path.

“There was no playbook to go by, other than the way I was raised by my own parents,” Osceola said. “I wanted Dakota to know that I would always be there, regardless of what the problem was. If your kid feels like you’re judging them, they’re going to think you think they’re a bad person. And they’re not going to come to you. They’re going to shut you out.”

Dakota Osceola and her daughter, Mia, walk down the driveway of their home in Naples on May 3, 2019. Many members of their family, including Dakota's mother, brother, and grandparents, live on the same street as Dakota and Mia. ""We have everything we need, and that's each other,"" she said. ""We're trying to be financially independent, trying our best to work as hard as we can to accomplish our goals, and that's really what it's been about since the beginning of the Osceolas."" (Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Osceola said she had to check herself frequently when figuring out how to help her daughter and how involved to get in Dakota’s life during her difficult periods.

In Osceola’s experience, giving tough love sometimes meant letting Dakota sit in jail when she was arrested, taking her to rehab centers again and again, telling her daughter what she needed to hear and letting her make her own mistakes while remaining vigilant.

Osceola said she’s a problem solver and a fixer. But she knew she couldn’t fix her daughter’s problems for her no matter how much she wanted to.

“It’s letting them fall,” Osceola said. “It’s the hardest thing a parent can do. But if you don’t let them hit their own version of rock bottom and let them get back up themselves, they’re not going to find that road to recovery.”

She left an abusive relationship and is a single mom to her 2-year-old daughter, Mia. She has become actively involved in her family’s Seminole culture, including causes related to indigenous women’s issues. She raises awareness about violence against women and raises money for the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center.

Dakota started a business selling traditional Seminole jewelry. She spends hours every day buried in beads, creating necklaces, bracelets and earrings in intricate color patterns. Dakota and her mom, who also beads, sell their creations on Seminole and Miccosukee reservations in South Florida and beyond.

“I’m really proud. It saved my life,” Dakota said of beading.

History of drug use

Dakota said she started partying and skipping class in high school. She said she started smoking marijuana when she was 16 years old. She eventually moved on to hallucinogens. Then Xanax.

“That was my first time getting to the point where I wasn’t remembering giant blocks of time,” she said.

In 2012, when Dakota was 18, Collier County Sheriff’s deputies arrested her at her mom’s house on charges of possession of alcohol by a minor, marijuana and drug paraphernalia. She was arrested again soon after being released from the Collier jail on another marijuana possession charge.

Osceola was out of town a lot because of her job with the Seminole Tribe of Florida. She’s currently a tribal judge and worked at the Sheriff’s Office from 1995 to 2004.

Osceola said it felt like she blinked and things changed with her daughter. She can’t remember when the transition happened.

“I was on the road a lot, and so I think that’s why it seemed like it happened so fast…,” she said.

Dakota’s drug use became an emergency for Osceola, and she wanted it to be everybody else’s emergency, too. When Osceola needed help for herself and her daughter, she turned to her tribe and her former coworkers at the Sheriff’s Office. They became her extended support network. She reached out to whatever resources she could find.

“I didn’t care if they arrested her. That was fine,” Osceola said. “Jail, institutions or death, and I’ll choose jail. I’ll choose an institution for my daughter. Who wants to choose death?”

Dakota was always open about her struggles, her mom said. She’s unapologetically herself and was brutally honest about her addiction. It was never a secret, but it was still difficult for Osceola to accept.

“I’m the one who had to tell myself the truth about what was really going on most of the time,” Osceola said. “I had to be brave enough to start asking questions. And that’s not easy when you know your child will tell you the truth. That’s the ground floor of denial, not knowing and not being brave enough to even ask the questions.”

Dakota’s first rehab treatment began days after her 2012 arrest. She stayed at a treatment center for about 100 days, she said.

“It gave me a dose of independence and really showed me what life could be,” Dakota said.

Her sobriety didn’t last long when she got back home. She had more rehab stints between 2013 and 2015. A series of traumatic losses compounded her struggle.

One friend died in a motorcycle crash. Others died of overdoses. A guy she was dating died of an overdose in March 2015, one day after the pair went looking for apartments to move into together.

“ … My drug use went off the charts after that happened,” Dakota said. “I was self-medicating not to feel that pain.”

Dakota’s mom took her to a rehab center in Tampa three days later.

“After that I was like, you know what? This is the reality of it: You can either die, go to jail, or be institutionalized for the rest of your life because you did some pretty bad harm to yourself,” Dakota said. “I didn’t take it seriously before that.”

Beading, beading, beading

Dakota believes beautiful things can come from terrible situations.

Everything she has gone through, she said, was meant to happen to bring better things into her life. She feels that way about her beadwork and her daughter.

In 2015, during one of their weekly phone calls when she was at the Tampa center, Dakota asked her mom to bring her plastic bin full of beads.

Osceola visited a bead store in Naples and bought pliers and wire. She stuffed Dakota’s bead bin with everything she would need and delivered it to her.

Dakota grew up in a house full of beads. When she was little, she sat in her family’s booths at various reservations while they sold their art.

Her mom has had a massive collection since she was a kid, and when Dakota was about 5 years old, she started collecting her own.

Osceola grew up in Naples but lived within her tribal culture. Her life was all about her family and the traditional art they made and sold so they could pay the bills. Her aunts and cousins sew Seminole patchwork “like no one’s business,” and her dad makes jewelry. Osceola learned how to weave baskets, make dolls and sew, though she said she was a failure as a seamstress. Osceola and her dad also have a beading business together.

“Beading was my thing,” Osceola said.

(Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

And it’s become her daughter’s thing. Making traditional art for survival took on a different meaning for Dakota. She didn’t need to make jewelry to support a family, pay bills or put herself through school; she needed it to work through her struggles.

The day Dakota picked up her beads at the rehab facility became her first day of healing.

“I was like: Wow, I really love this. This is what’s gonna keep me sober,” Dakota said. “This is what’s gonna keep me clean. This is what’s gonna give me purpose.”

Dakota began thriving. She made jewelry for her friends in rehab and taught some of them how to bead. When she left the center, she got a booth at a market in Ybor City near downtown Tampa and sold countless pieces.

“You know, that independence and the ability to set goals for herself, and to know that she did it and it was 100 percent her effort … that did more than anything toward her sobriety,” Osceola said.

Finding peace

Dakota had another major obstacle to overcome before she found her peace.

She said she was in an abusive relationship with her daughter’s father. Dakota said he was physically abusive before she became pregnant and he didn’t stop after. The man was arrested on a domestic battery charge in late 2015 after hitting Dakota in the face, court records show.

Dakota said she was on the phone with her mom when her ex hit her, and she told her mom what happened.

Looking back on that day, Dakota’s mom said her daughter’s life sometimes felt like she was walking back through some of her own experiences.

“I had to get past an emotional reaction and wanting to be the mom that picks up a stick, goes out and beats the crap out of somebody to rational thought,” Osceola said.

She had to think to herself: What tools have I learned along the way?

Osceola said she experienced a years-long abusive relationship when she was in college. She said she thought the abuse was her fault at the time, that she must have done something to deserve it. She stayed for five years, and it was five years too long, she said.

Osceola knows her daughter. She knows telling Dakota what to do doesn’t work, because being told what to do didn’t work for Osceola, either. Osceola checked herself again.

She believed in allowing her daughter to make her own mistakes before. To reach rock bottom so she could get back up. But Dakota had only been in recovery for a few months. She wasn’t on solid ground just yet.

“I knew this was something that could push her over the edge,” Osceola said.

This was not a rock bottom she would let her daughter reach.

Osceola put her foot down in her own way. She told Dakota she couldn’t let the man do that to her and asked her daughter to let her call the Sheriff’s Office.

The man was arrested. He was adjudicated guilty in 2016 and sentenced to a year in the county jail with credit for time served, followed by three years of state probation.

Dakota said she tried to work things out with him when he was released from the jail. She knew immediately it wouldn’t work out. She said she thinks he would have become violent again.

“I didn’t want that around my child,” she said.

Dakota moved back to Naples after the incident. She had her family’s support throughout her pregnancy and in the two years since she had Mia.

Dakota said she now feels like she’s in a good place — in her home, her work and motherhood.

“My daughter’s happy,” Dakota said. “She loves this space, she loves our house, she loves coming home. And that’s where I wanna be. This is where I’m happy.”

It takes a tribe

Dakota said her mom and grandparents have given her everything she needs emotionally and mentally.

She and her mom get their strength from their family, their culture and their moments of darkness.

When Dakota was using drugs, and even when she wasn’t, her mom was always there to pick her up and come up with solutions to whatever she was going through. Her grandma was there to make her feel warm and loved. Her grandma made her feel like she was something special.

Dakota and her mom said they also derive their strength from what it means to be indigenous women: community-oriented, strong, loving, accepting. Warriors.

Since Dakota started selling her jewelry on reservations, she has opened herself up to people and made lasting friendships with other indigenous women. They support each other’s businesses and talk about their traditional arts and preserving culture.

“We all try to empower each other,” Dakota said. “We show up for each other and have our own economy.”

The strength, rich culture and power that Dakota’s family has passed on to her is something she wants to pass on to Mia.

Dakota’s mom was driven to work, be financially independent, support her family and be involved in tribal issues locally and nationally. Now Dakota is at a stage in which she values her business, financial independence, providing for her daughter and being involved in her community.

Everything the Osceolas do they do together, for each other, and with the help of their family.

She’s raising Mia with a secure, united family. Dakota likes to say her mom is a badass, and that she’s lucky to be a mom to a little girl she knows is going to turn out the same way.

“I want Mia to be unapologetically herself, no matter how weird or silly that may be,” Dakota said. “To treat people how she wants to be treated and never settle for anybody less than what her family can provide for her.”

Dakota has a lot of hope — for her daughter, herself, her business, her future.

That hope came from surviving her addictions and finding her power through family background. She said she has lost the desire to use drugs. While she feels like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders, she works on herself and her mental health regularly and makes sure she maintains a healthy, balanced lifestyle.

(Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Dakota’s mom said addiction runs in their family. And substance abuse issues affect indigenous populations in general. Osceola has worried about history repeating itself, but she believes in Dakota and her commitment to her sobriety.

“I think a lot of people in our society look at addiction as a weakness instead of a source of strength,” Osceola said. “That’s not our weakness. The battles native people have gone through, it’s not our weakness. It’s our strength that we survived.”

During that final stint in rehab, Dakota willed herself to get back up. Her survival is inextricably linked to the strength she gets from her family.

“We have everything we need, and that’s each other,” Dakota said.

205,JACKSONVILLE MOTHER'S DAY ADOPTIONS: 25 kids adopted in Jacksonville in time for Mother's Day,"0 25 kids adopted in Jacksonville in time for Mother's Day

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Just in time for Mother’s Day, Jacksonville children were given the gift of a forever home.

On Thursday, there wasn’t a dry eye in the courtroom at the Duval County Courthouse as people cried tears of joy.

TRENDING:

Andrea Hurt and her husband Ronald adopted three boys and a little girl. They now have 6 children total, including their two biological kids.

“Some call it chaos. We call it family because it’s constant all over the place doctors’ appointments, therapist appointments,” Hurt said.

They stood before the judge in matching blue shirts and ties. The Hurts said they were determined to keep the siblings together.

“These kids were staying together and we were going to do whatever it took to do it,” Hurt said.

One foster parent tells Action News Jax this is the greatest gift she could have received.

“We know it’s all official for the special weekend and we just know we can all celebrate together and we’re officially a family now,” Bethany Moore said.

Moore will celebrate Mother’s Day with her boys, Theo, and his brother Franklin.

Family Support Services of North Florida said there are more than 850 children in foster care, a number that’s remained steady for the last two years.

The group usually gets about 80 new foster families licensed each year, but that number doesn’t grow because people are choosing to adopt instead of fostering.

Tajuana Bronson has been a foster parent for six years and said the program needs more people willing to step up to the challenge.

“The kids really need you. A lot of these parents, they are out with the drug epidemic, just some of them are not able to care for them so it’s good if you have somebody, if you're able to do something to help somebody, why not,"" Bronson said.

Family Support Services of North Florida said in total, 25 children were adopted to 15 families on Thursday.

206,Holbrook: Building an international perspective for students and faculty,"John Sexton, past president of New York University, was pictured on the front page of a recent issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education celebrating commencement at NYU Abu Dhabi. The headline accompanying the image was “The end of a global era: How grand plans for international education are fading,” and the article by Karin Fischer was titled “The Sunset of International Education’s Golden Era.”

In my view, internationalization of our universities is more important than it ever has been and the activities on all three University of South Florida campuses support this view.

I was introduced to international education in 11th grade when a high school student from Turkey joined our class under the auspices of the AIFS (American Institute for Foreign Study) program. This seemed to me to be a very bold venture for a high school girl to leave home and stay with an American family for a year; and it was a novelty for our class, even though we were a large urban high school in a university city. Few of us had ever been abroad or experienced working with international students. Even during my college years, study abroad was limited.

It was not until I began to attend research conferences overseas that I learned to appreciate the extraordinary benefits of international experiences. They changed my own understanding of the differences, similarities and common values among people of all nations. Today, an international experience is an intrinsic component of the college experience; 10 percent of all U.S. students study abroad before graduation, according to a 2019 report from the Institute for International Education titled Study Abroad Matters.

In the last 25 or so years, the push for international education on university campuses has been a priority and often a specific goal of an institution’s strategic plan. Last year, well over one million international students, from more than 200 countries, studied in the United States, including 46,500 in Florida, ranking the state seventh nationally

As host to 6,219 international students from 142 countries, USF Tampa ranks No. 25 among universities. USFSM hosts 55 international students from 24 countries, and our number of international students will increase when a residence hall is completed. USFSM students can participate in one of six education abroad programs now, and will be able to engage in nearly 20 programs organized at USF St. Petersburg and a multitude of faculty-led or affiliated international programs sponsored by USF Tampa.

USFSM’s second research magazine features stories about students from Turkey, Albania and Serbia, and faculty who are engaged in research abroad. Topics include studying refugee populations and other projects in sub-Saharan Africa, Ghana, South Africa and Uganda. We are building an international perspective for our students and faculty.

The University of South Florida has been committed to offering education abroad for USF students and recruiting international students for many years. Around 2010, USF World was created to promote a global culture at the university, by globalizing student success and deepening global engagement. As the front door to programs, responsibilities and activities in the international arena, USF World encompasses the university’s engagement with the world. The university community is now empowered to function as global leaders and global stewards and it has been a success.

USF World has received national awards for campus internationalization, innovation in international education, access and equity and international partnerships. USF has also been a top Peace Corps volunteer-generating institution and, for the past two years, the top producer of Fulbright scholars. Three USFSM faculty have received Fulbright Specialist opportunities for short-term work abroad in Turkey, India and New Zealand

This year, USF sent 1,628 students abroad, an experience that improves 21st century skills and employability of graduates. USF is currently hosting 4,638 international students who are needed to fill positions in the U.S. after graduation especially in the STEM and business fields. Those who return to their countries as alumni maintain ties with the university, building strong networks of USF graduates around the world.

Even with these successes, why exactly, is it important for USFSM and our community to not let the “grand plans for international education fade”?

Universities help students integrate into international communities and work environments at home and abroad. Not all students will work internationally, but all students will interact with international colleagues. In Florida, one out of every five jobs has an international component.

As Walter H. Moos or SRI International said, “Our national security and our economic prosperity ultimately depend upon how well we educate today’s students to become tomorrow’s global leaders.”

There are more benefits and broader impact that international programs, experiences and students make. Research through international partnerships solves global problems that can only occur through collaboration. International students studying in the U.S. contributed $39 billion to the economy and supported more than 455,000 jobs in 2017-18 (students in Florida contributed $1.6 billion and filled 16,948 jobs). Companies and organizations seek a culturally diverse workforce, and students who engage in international experiences build confidence, communication skills, self-awareness, patience, perspective, resiliency, adaptability and comfort with ambiguity. Universities with strong international programs have stronger reputations and rankings are enhanced.

Finally, as Allan Goodman, president of the Institute for International Education, has stated, “academic and cultural exchange builds a safer, more peaceful world.” International experiences help us to understand ourselves in a different context. We cannot understand the politics and culture of our own country without first comparing our own perspectives with the politics and cultures of others.

207,Nissan Altima in Maleah Davis case found in Missouri City parking lot,"- Houston police say the silver Nissan Altima that 4-year-old Maleah Davis was said to be riding in when she was allegedly abducted has been located.

Police say the car was found in the parking lot of a Missouri City shopping center. Officers are on the scene.

Police have been searching for the car since Maleah was reported missing on Saturday. According to police, Maleah's stepfather Darion Vence said he, Maleah, and his 1-year-old son were ambushed by three men in a 2010 blue Chevrolet pick up Friday night in northeast Houston and abducted. Police say Vence said he and the boy were later left in Sugar Land.

Sugar Land police say Vence told investigators conflicting information. Police say he first said he walked to Sugar Land Methodist Hospital after regaining consciousness Saturday following the alleged abduction. Then, Sugar Land police say he changed his story to say he was dropped off there by someone in a car.

A Houston police investigator told FOX 26 that Vence is a person of interest in her disappearance.

Texas Equusearch resumed the ground search for Maleah in southwest Houston Thursday morning. Heavy rains on Tuesday left the search area flooded on Wednesday and caused Texas Equusearch to suspend their ground search. They searched by air instead.

Crews were initially looking for Maleah in northeast Houston but shifted search efforts to southwest Houston on Tuesday. Texas Equusearch set up a command post near the apartments where the girl is said to have lived with her mom and stepdad when she went missing.

If you have any information that can help police, you can call them or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS.

209,A mother's greatest gift: passing down the embarrassment,"Mary Carr (from left), with her daughter, Cynthia Carr Falardeau, and niece Susan Cobb McGowen, at a family gathering in 1979. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO FROM CYNTHIA FALARDEAU)

My 16-year-old son, Wyatt, has a constant complaint: “Mom! You are so embarrassing!”

To which I always reply, “You have no idea! I learned from the best!”

Which begs the question: Is being embarrassing hereditary?

Twenty-years ago, my mother came for a visit. During that week we laughed, cried and finally resolved many conflicts. The last night, she thanked my husband, Jim, and I, for “The best week ever!”

The next day she died of a massive stroke.

Heaven gained God’s best party girl, children’s advocate, community volunteer and mother to anyone who showed up for Sunday dinner. Finding a way to heal, I vowed to carry on her legacy and begin anew. I quit my job and began my own quest to become a mother.

It is less about what she taught me and more about the mother I have become.

This story begins with semantics.

For example, I believe I am my son’s best advocate. He calls it, “Yelling at my teachers!” Like any typical teenager, he exaggerates. Maintaining communication with his teachers equates to being loud in a juvenile mind.

In the eighth grade, my Home Economics teacher, Mrs. Uzzle, gave us the assignment to create a piece of clothing. I followed a Butterfield pattern to make a plaid wrap skirt. My mother was infuriated that my seams were not straight.

To avoid the teacher’s review, I wore the skirt to school and earned an A-plus. Upon hearing this, my mother hauled over to Hadley E. Watt’s Middle School and asked for my teacher to reconsider the grade she gave me. To which I say, “Who does that?”

Learning to network was a close second to advocacy. Mom was always the Girl Scout leader. My friends thought she was “cool.” Somewhere between her wild clothes, big sunglasses and platform shoes, they knew that she was all about “girl power.”

One summer, our troupe planned a bike ride through a nearby town. It was a very hot day. The girls asked my mom if we could stop for ice cream. I knew my mom did not have any money. However, she brightly replied, “Yes, I think we can make that happen!”

The next thing I know, we are all walking into a bank. My mother confidently asks to speak to the branch manager. I am mortified by what I think is going to happen. She meets the man, extends a firm handshake and asks for a short-term loan. The man looks over my 10 friends and me, pauses for a moment, and says, “I think we can make that happen!”

Who goes to a town where they don’t live, to a bank they don’t use, and gets ice cream for kids? Later she would quip, “I was just trying to teach you that anything is possible.”

Growing up, especially as a teenager, I would beg my mother to dress “normal.” Somewhere between her belly-dancing phase and mid-life crisis came the influence of J.R. Ewing, played by actor Larry Hagman. Mind you, we lived in a conservative suburb of Centerville, Ohio. This was a long way from the home of her favorite TV show, “Dallas.”

I remember wanting desperately to be invisible when I was in pubic with her. Years later, she traded this look for wearing Birkenstocks with a fur coat. This was only seconded by her exercising in a Mickey Mouse sports bra. Her reply was always, “Life is too short to not express yourself.”

My mother’s colorful influence remains a constant presence in my life. Wyatt recently summed it up best, “A mom is the spirit of your heart.”

Despite my smother tendencies, perhaps he, too, knows my love is true.”

Cynthia Falardeau is chief executive officer of the Education Foundation of Indian River County. She lives in Vero Beach, Florida with her husband, Jim, and their son, Wyatt.

The San Antonio Police Department is actively searching for a 3-year-old girl who is believed to be kidnapped by her biological mother Gabriella Kathleen Lucio, 20, who climbed in through a window of an apartment to kidnap her.

Police believe Zanyah is in grave danger. She was last seen wearing a pink tank top, pink pajama pants with rainbows and hearts, and she was not wearing any shoes. She is 3 feet, 4 inches and weighs 38 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes.

No vehicle description is available at this time. Anyone with information on Lucio’s whereabouts is urged to call Special Victims Unit at (210) 207-2313.

217,Emotional 911 calls released in shootout that killed 7-year-old girl,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The State Attorney's Office on Monday released audio of 911 calls made moments after a shootout that killed a 7-year-old girl in August.

Heidy Rivas Villanueva was caught in the crossfire that unfolded in the parking lot of a Westside strip mall after a botched robbery, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. Heidy was shot in the head and did not survive.

Editor's Note: This story contains graphic details that some may find upsetting.

People nearby called 911 for help. One caller said they saw her father carrying the girl's body and screaming.

""Lord have mercy. I'm on 103rd (Street). I just heard some gunshots in the parking lot. I don't know what happened. But I saw this man go in the car, it look like he grabbed his child. They're gonna have to send the police out here,"" one 911 caller can be heard saying.

Later in that call, a 911 operator asks, ""Do you know if that child was shot?""

""It seemed like it. He was just holding her. She seemed lifeless. He was holding her and just running and screaming, running and screaming,"" the caller replies.

Another person also called 911 to report the shooting on 103rd Street.

Operator: ""You said someone's been shot?""

Caller: ""Yeah. There's a kid that's been shot. There was a shooting.""

Police said Trevonte Phoenix and Abrion Price had arranged a gun sale near the strip mall, but had actually planned to rob the buyer. They ended up trading gunfire with Stanley Harris, a friend of the buyer, police said.

Investigators said a bullet from Harris' gun struck Heidy, killing her. Because police said Phoenix and Price were committing a crime when Heidy was killed, they were each charged with felony murder, under Florida law. Harris is charged with third-degree murder.

Phoenix pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last month. Before that, a fourth man, Edward Garcia, who was charged as a getaway driver, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to a first-degree felony. Both are awaiting sentencing.

Price and Harris have pleaded not guilty to their charges. They are awaiting trial.

221,Video shows Florida officer punch teen near Parkland,"""What are you doing?"" a girl shouted. ""He's bleeding!""

It was Thursday at a suburban town plaza in Tamarac, Florida, about 6 miles and 14 months removed from the high school massacre in Parkland. A group of teenagers gathered where kids were known to have caused disturbances in the past. A Broward County sheriff's deputy, a member of the force criticized for its response to the Parkland attack, saw one teenager who had previously trespassed, according to arrest records.

That teen's phone bounced onto the pavement. A 15-year old went to pick it up and, in a widely circulated video from a bystander, he did so in front of a pepper-spray-wielding deputy. The deputy triggered the spray at the teen's face, and the deputy threw him to the ground.

Another deputy, Christopher Krickovich, straddled him, smashed his forehead into the asphalt several times and punched him in the head. The teen extended his arms.

""What are you doing?"" a girl shouted. ""He's bleeding!""

The arrest and charges against the teenager, coupled with the video, led to criticism and prompted an investigation. But they have also posed a difficult question for a community concerned by what many thought was a passive police response to violence: Is this the inevitable result of public demand?

The Broward County Sheriff's Office began more physical and aggressive training after a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year - implemented by the new Broward County sheriff, Gregory Tony, who was appointed in January.

The training led to violent altercations, some in the office believe, resulting in fractured bones, a detached retina and, in March, bleeding in the brain, said Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff's Office Deputies Association.

""It's almost like a 'Fight Club' atmosphere,"" Bell told The Washington Post.

Bell said full-contact takedown training has become a priority, despite concerns over injuries. The new policy is a direct result of the Parkland response's perceived shortcomings. And because of that guideline, Bell said, the deputies acted accordingly in Tamarac.

""People want accountability in Broward County,"" Bell said. ""But what the community screams for, and what they want, are two different things.""

Broward County Mayor Mark Bogen disagrees. He called for Krickovich to be fired for the ""outrageous and unacceptable"" altercation. Tony launched an investigation, saying in a video statement that he was appointed to bring accountability to the force.

""That accountability will be held not just for the sake of when we are right but in cases when we may be wrong,"" he said.

David Klinger, a criminal justice professor at University of Missouri, St. Louis, said Bell's defense obscures the occasional need to evaluate how use of force policies take shape in reality.

""Oftentimes training doesn't get to the philosophical root to explain to officers why you need to do X, Y or Z,"" Klinger said. ""Rather, it's just 'do X, Y or Z.' It's very easy for officers to misapply.""

Klinger added: ""If there is a problem with the particular use of force, and (deputies) were doing what they were trained to do and told to do, you can't criticize them. You have to see where it broke down in the chain.""

Occasionally, policing doctrine in response to one crime can lead to other infractions, Klinger said.

Thursday's altercation with officers and an unarmed teen reminded Klinger of the police killing of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old who was fatally shot in 2014 after police responded to a call of a young man pointing a gun at people. Tamir had a toy gun and was killed by police.

Later, the officer said he responded to the call as an active-shooter scenario, even though no shots were fired. That training with contextualizing threats, Klinger said, may have contributed to the killing. ""We have to figure out to teach officers how to identify and define things in a very accurate fashion,"" he said.

Bell, the association president, said the teenager in Thursday's altercation was chased and thrown to the ground after being pepper sprayed to keep him from hurting himself - like being hit by a car, for instance.

An attorney for the teenager, Richard Della Fera, criticized those comments.

""I'm so relieved to hear they're very concerned for my client's safety,"" he said, with sarcasm.

Della Fera said he will meet with the state attorney's office to discuss the behavior of the deputies and pending charges of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest without violence and trespassing.

The attorney argues that charging documents that described a tense mob of 200 students was overstated; smartphone video recorded the scene. In the video, about 15 or so students appear to be near the deputies.

Della Fera also disputed the idea that his client, whom he declined to name, had a fighting stance when he stood next to the deputy. The teen's arms appear to be at his sides in the video. The J.P. Taravella High School sophomore suffered a broken nose and may have other injuries, Della Fera said.

Della Fera conceded that it was a ""chaotic situation"" at the end.

""But police should be the calmest people in the situation,"" he said. ""I don't know what this all has to do with Parkland.""",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190423/video-shows-florida-officer-punch-teen-near-parkland?rssfeed=true,2019-04-23T11:22:11Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
222,Severe weather prompts flight cancellations in South Florida,"There is a severe weather warning in effect for Palm Beach and Collier counties Friday night. File photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images

PEMBROKE PARK, Fla. - A strong storm system barreling through Florida on Friday left a girl dead just south of Tallahassee and prompted flight cancellations at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Miami International Airport, as it prompted tornado warnings in Georgia, the Carolinas and southern Virginia.

A severe thunderstorm watch was activated in Palm Beach and Collier counties until 10 p.m. This includes the cities of West Palm Beach, Naples, Clewiston and Labelle. An isolated storm or two could produce damaging wind gusts.

There is also a high risk of rip currents, powerful channels of water flowing quickly away from shore in Broward and Miami-Dade counties. The line of strong storms will blow through South Florida until 11 p.m., and the heavy rain will move out after midnight. Saturday morning will be mostly dry.

The 8-year-old girl who died Friday was identified as Mariah Juliette Weinman, a student at Woodville Elementary School. Her 12-year-old brother was injured when a tree fell onto their house in Leon County's town of Woodville.

""We are deeply saddened by the loss of a Woodville School second grader this morning,"" the Leon County Schools tweeted. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this time.""

On Thursday, the same storm system left three drivers dead in Mississippi and a woman in Alabama when a tree fell on her mobile home.

A woman who reported that she and her infant daughter were kidnapped Thursday has been charged with attempted murder after she lied about the whole thing, according to the Henderson County sheriff.Krista Madden, 35, was charged with first-degree attempted murder and is being held at the Henderson County Detention Center on $750,000 bond, according to police and the detention center website.During a morning news conference, Sheriff Lowell Griffin called the discovery of the baby miraculous.""It's by the grace of God that we're standing here with a child that's been discovered and is alive,"" he said.The baby, 7-week-old Shaylie Madden, is said to be in ""very good condition,"" but he did not provide specifics on her condition.Baby found in woodsJust before 8 p.m., a woman called 911 to report that she and her husband found a baby that had been tossed over a bank off Slick Rock Road, Griffin said.Griffin said a woman had gone to her mailbox to check for mail and heard the faint cry of what she thought was a baby.She called her husband, who went down about a 75-foot embankment to find the infant who had rolled out of her car seat, Griffin said.The woman was recorded crying as she told a dispatcher that they found the baby “down in the woods.”She said the baby was bruised, her head was “banged up” and her leg was badly injured.“There’s no people down here,” she said. “We’re in a remote area. Somebody must have pulled up beside and tossed her like a piece of trash.”“It’s a little baby girl,” she said. “She’s so scared. She’s so scared.”Mother made up story, sheriff saysGriffin said Madden lied about the kidnapping.""At this point, we don't believe that (her story) to be factual at all -- none of that,"" he said.Asheville police said Madden reported that she and her 7-week-old infant, Shaylie, were kidnapped about 4:30 p.m along Dearborn Street in Biltmore Park.Police said Madden told them two people wearing ski masks were driving a silver 2014 Mazda CX5 with North Carolina tag, EMX-5984.She said Shaylie was wearing a pink onesie with horizontal white stripes, police said.Madden gave a vague description of the two suspects.Investigators were able to ping Madden's phone to be in the area of east Henderson County on Grant Mountain Road.As deputies were headed there, they were notified that someone living in the area had found an abandoned car in the area at Barnwell Baptist Church, Griffin said.As deputies arrived, they encountered Madden, who told them she had escaped the kidnappers, Griffin said.Madden was taken to the Henderson County Sheriff's Office in Hendersonville to be evaluated and interviewed, Griffin said.""All indications lead us to believe that she was the one, and she acted alone,"" Griffin said, referring to Madden.During a short bond hearing Friday, Madden waived her right for a court-appointed attorney.

230,Holbrook: Why internationalize a university?,"John Sexton, past president of New York University, was pictured on the front page of a recent issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education celebrating commencement at NYU Abu Dhabi. The headline accompanying the image was “The end of a global era: How grand plans for international education are fading,” and the article by Karin Fischer was titled “The Sunset of International Education’s Golden Era.”

In my view, internationalization of our universities is more important than it ever has been and the activities on all three University of South Florida campuses support this view.

I was introduced to international education in 11th grade when a high school student from Turkey joined our class under the auspices of the AIFS (American Institute for Foreign Study) program. This seemed to me to be a very bold venture for a high school girl to leave home and stay with an American family for a year; and it was a novelty for our class, even though we were a large urban high school in a university city. Few of us had ever been abroad or experienced working with international students. Even during my college years, study abroad was limited.

It was not until I began to attend research conferences overseas that I learned to appreciate the extraordinary benefits of international experiences. They changed my own understanding of the differences, similarities and common values among people of all nations. Today, an international experience is an intrinsic component of the college experience; 10 percent of all U.S. students study abroad before graduation, according to a 2019 report from the Institute for International Education titled Study Abroad Matters.

In the last 25 or so years, the push for international education on university campuses has been a priority and often a specific goal of an institution’s strategic plan. Last year, well over one million international students, from more than 200 countries, studied in the United States, including 46,500 in Florida, ranking the state seventh nationally

As host to 6,219 international students from 142 countries, USF Tampa ranks No. 25 among universities. USFSM hosts 55 international students from 24 countries, and our number of international students will increase when a residence hall is completed. USFSM students can participate in one of six education abroad programs now, and will be able to engage in nearly 20 programs organized at USF St. Petersburg and a multitude of faculty-led or affiliated international programs sponsored by USF Tampa.

USFSM’s second research magazine features stories about students from Turkey, Albania and Serbia, and faculty who are engaged in research abroad. Topics include studying refugee populations and other projects in sub-Saharan Africa, Ghana, South Africa and Uganda. We are building an international perspective for our students and faculty.

The University of South Florida has been committed to offering education abroad for USF students and recruiting international students for many years. Around 2010, USF World was created to promote a global culture at the university, by globalizing student success and deepening global engagement. As the front door to programs, responsibilities and activities in the international arena, USF World encompasses the university’s engagement with the world. The university community is now empowered to function as global leaders and global stewards and it has been a success.

USF World has received national awards for campus internationalization, innovation in international education, access and equity and international partnerships. USF has also been a top Peace Corps volunteer-generating institution and, for the past two years, the top producer of Fulbright scholars. Three USFSM faculty have received Fulbright Specialist opportunities for short-term work abroad in Turkey, India and New Zealand

This year, USF sent 1,628 students abroad, an experience that improves 21st century skills and employability of graduates. USF is currently hosting 4,638 international students who are needed to fill positions in the U.S. after graduation especially in the STEM and business fields. Those who return to their countries as alumni maintain ties with the university, building strong networks of USF graduates around the world.

Even with these successes, why exactly, is it important for USFSM and our community to not let the “grand plans for international education fade”?

Universities help students integrate into international communities and work environments at home and abroad. Not all students will work internationally, but all students will interact with international colleagues. In Florida, one out of every five jobs has an international component.

As Walter H. Moos or SRI International said, “Our national security and our economic prosperity ultimately depend upon how well we educate today’s students to become tomorrow’s global leaders.”

There are more benefits and broader impact that international programs, experiences and students make. Research through international partnerships solves global problems that can only occur through collaboration. International students studying in the U.S. contributed $39 billion to the economy and supported more than 455,000 jobs in 2017-18 (students in Florida contributed $1.6 billion and filled 16,948 jobs). Companies and organizations seek a culturally diverse workforce, and students who engage in international experiences build confidence, communication skills, self-awareness, patience, perspective, resiliency, adaptability and comfort with ambiguity. Universities with strong international programs have stronger reputations and rankings are enhanced.

Finally, as Allan Goodman, president of the Institute for International Education, has stated, “academic and cultural exchange builds a safer, more peaceful world.” International experiences help us to understand ourselves in a different context. We cannot understand the politics and culture of our own country without first comparing our own perspectives with the politics and cultures of others.

The phones seem to ring constantly inside a small office in North Palm Beach.Operators answer the phones, identify themselves, and the questions begin.“Have you contacted the police?” they ask.“Has an officer been assigned the case?”“What’s the child name?”Those are standard questions at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.At their newly opened call center in North Palm Beach, they’re constantly taking tips, looking for missing kids or trying to identify children who have been found.They are now trying to help identify the newborn baby girl found in a dumpster in Western Boca Raton Wednesday morning.The child was found alive by two people just after 9 a.m. at the Alister Apartments on Boca Entrada Boulevard.“We’ll try to help locate this child’s parents, try to identify who this child is,” said Callahan Walsh, a child advocate at the Center.The Center does not serve as the investigators. They leave that up to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.Instead, they serve as a tool for law enforcement, taking tips and handling information.“Our call center operators take these calls from all over the place: law enforcement, parents, educators, victims themselves,” Walsh said.The operators take between 300 and 500 calls every day.They can take those calls in any of 190 different languages.They hope that one of those calls turns out to be the one that identifies the baby found in Boca Raton and leads law enforcement to her parents.“When we get one of these recoveries, are able to reunite one of these children with their families, it’s what makes it all worthwhile,” Walsh said.If you have any information about the baby that was found, you can either call the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office or you can call the center at 1-800-THE LOST.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/national-center-for-missing-and-exploited-children-wants-to-identify-baby-found-in-dumpster/27412977,2019-05-09T02:12:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
232,"'It was horrifying,' says woman who gave birth in Broward jail","Tammy Jackson was released from the hospital on Wednesday.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - Tammy Jackson -- the woman who gave birth, alone, in a Broward County jail cell -- is home Wednesday, and spoke to exclusively to Local 10 News about her ordeal.

Jackson suffers from a mental illness, bipolar schizophrenia, according to her mother, Shirley Nixon, who was with her when she was released from the hospital Wednesday after several days of mental health evaluation.

Her condition is delicate, and what happened to her is disturbing.

But, Jackson was determined to say what she had to say.

""If anything, blessed to be alive,"" Jackson said.

Her little girl, Miranda, who weighed 6 6 pounds, 7 ounces, was also released from the hospital Wednesday.

""I'm glad she's out and hopefully, things will fall into place, She'll get her the help she needs, and I can get my grandbaby,"" Nixon said.

Nixon learned from me that her granddaughter was not born in the hospital where she first held her.

She was born at the North Broward Bureau. She also learned that her daughter was alone in an isolation cell when she went into labor.

""It was horrifying. It was horrifying,"" Jackson said. ""When she fell, I had to bend down to pick her up and tell her, ‘I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that to happen.' She was still crying,"" Jackson said.

Later, at her home, I asked Jackson why she apologized to her baby.

""I didn't even get clean before I had her. Also, she had hit the floor, and to me that was hard because she was just coming out of me,"" Jackson said. ""I just apologized for her being in the jailhouse. The situation, because I would rather for my mom to be by my side in the hospital with me having her.""

Jackson was arrested this year and held on trespassing and drug charges.

She's struggled with homelessness and bipolar schizophrenia, according to her mother. An incident report details how a Broward County Sheriff's Office deputy saw Jackson inside her isolation cell the morning of April 10 ""screaming in pain.""

The deputy reported later hearing a baby crying and seeing Jackson holding her child in her arms before she was rushed to the hospital.

""It isn't a joke when it comes to pregnancy. And if they don't want to abide by that, they should get fired because I don't believe no woman should really have to go through that,"" Jackson said.

Asked if she thinks anyone will be held accountable for what happened, Jackson said, ""No, but they should. It was neglect ... emotional abuse.""

Jackson said she is looking forward to moving on from this and hopes to be reunited with her daughter soon.

On Wednesday, she gave herself a pep talk.

""You're a strong woman. Don't put yourself down not yet. Just be grateful and thankful that you're standing and, yes, you are strong,"" she said.

Jackson also thanked her public defender who worked to get her released on her own recognizance.

The public defender's office is working to see whether Jackson will be able to have her parental rights restored.

In the meantime, the internal affairs investigation into this incident continues.

Rather, at 3:16 a.m., they tried to contact an on-call doctor, who could not be reached until 7:22 a.m., according to the attorneys.The doctor said he would check on Jackson when he arrived at the jail, the letter said.An hour and 38 minutes later, Jackson told her lawyers, she was still in the jail cell by herself, bleeding, ""and no urgency was demonstrated by your staff,"" the lawyers wrote.""Six hours and 54 minutes after asking for help, a (Broward Sheriff's Office) tech notified medical staff that Ms. Jackson was holding her newborn baby in her arms, having delivered the baby without medication or the assistance of a physician,"" the letter said.The sheriff's office has launched an investigation into the delivery, said spokeswoman Gina Carter. A doctor and two nurses provided Jackson care after she gave birth at the North Broward Bureau, Carter said, and the child ""was placed with an appropriate caregiver.""After providing a short statement via email, Carter said CNN would have to file an official records request to see the incident report filed after Jackson gave birth.The North Broward Bureau houses minimum- and medium-security offenders and its main mission is to manage ""the mentally ill, medically infirm and special needs inmate population,"" according to the sheriff's office.Since Jackson's arrest in April, her lawyers said, she had been placed in an infirmary for monitoring.""The birth was not premature or unexpected,"" their letter said. ""Yet in her time of extreme need and vulnerability, BSO neglected to provide Ms. Jackson with the assistance and medical care all mothers need and deserve.""Not only was Ms. Jackson's health callously ignored, the life of her child was also put at grave risk.""How the incident will affect the woman's ""already fragile mental health"" remains to be determined, the lawyers said.Other inmates heard Jackson's screams during labor, CNN affiliate WPLG reported. Jackson's mother, Shirley Nixon, told the station she did not realize her daughter, who she said is bipolar and schizophrenic, had given birth in a jail cell rather than a hospital.""I figured she was born in the hospital,"" Nixon said of her granddaughter.

235,Dericka Lindsey case: 9-year-old's adopted mom to stand trial for her death,"CLOSE A memorial was held for 9-year-old Dericka Lindsay Thursday, Nov. 16, 2017. She died after her cousin sat on her as punishment Oct. 14.

A Pensacola woman will stand trial Thursday and Friday for her alleged role in a bizarre form of discipline that killed her adopted daughter.

Grace Joan Smith, 71, is the last of three people to face a jury in the death of 9-year-old Dericka Lindsey. Both Smith's husband, James Smith, and niece, Veronica Green Posey, have already been convicted and sentenced to prison for their roles in the child's death.

In October 2017, the Smiths reportedly called Posey to help them stop Dericka from misbehaving. Prosecutors say Grace Smith and Posey both spanked the girl, then Posey — who weighed approximately 320 pounds — sat on Dericka's torso for several minutes, suffocating her.

James Smith ultimately pleaded no contest to charges of aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. Posey was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Court records indicate both co-defendants could be called as witnesses in the Grace Smith's trial.

Grace Smith's trial was briefly delayed in February when a judge ruled she was not competent for trial. February. At the time, physicians testified that she suffered from dementia and refused to eat food or take medication.

Smith was involuntarily committed to a state hospital where staff worked to restore her ""competency"" and get her to a state where she could follow court proceedings and help her attorneys craft her defense.

Medical staff made quick progress, and in April the court determined that Smith was fit for trial.

236,Eric Yutzy celebrates Mother's Day with the story of his adoption,"MIAMI - The picture of a smiling school girl always went along with a story my parents were happy to tell.

They wanted me to know that Lisa, my birth mother, was just 16 when gave me life, and she fought to find a home to give me love.

Mary and Jan Yutzy had already adopted my older brother when they moved from California's Bay area to the suburbs of Boston.

“We were hoping to adopt again. We didn’t anticipate it would happen so quickly, but we’re delighted it did,” my father Jan Yutz said.

Late one summer night in 1980, my adoptive parents’ phone rang. It was a cross country call from a doctor colleague that knew they wanted a larger family.

""He said, 'Would you like to be a mother again?' and I said, ‘Oh, yes. When is the baby due?’ and he said, ‘The baby is here,’” my mother Mary Yutzy said.

An adoption agency had promised my birth mother that they had a home ready, but when the prospective parents discovered I was biracial, those people turned away. Still a child herself, Lisa knew she couldn't raise me, but she refused to leave the hospital until a family was found.

“The doctor with the mother and you still in the hospital, called me. He said to Lisa, ‘I know who will be very happy to get your baby,” Mary told me.

Mary was in California holding me the next day. That is where my two mothers met briefly in the hospital.

The short conversation left a lifelong impression on both of them. Mary telling Lisa my name and where I would be raised. They were key details that she would never forget and that would lead her to find me.

Lisa gave my mother a photo and left knowing her son was safe.

She wrote to me: “I can close this chapter of my life without looking back, never worrying that my son has found a good home. I was honored with that and along with you. That was a great gift she gave me.”

Just 48 hours after that surprise phone call, I went home to Massachusetts to be raised with the only family I ever knew, but knowing the story about my birth mother.

My parents praised her name, especially on my birthday and Mother’s Day and always supported any chance to reconnect their son with his mother.

“Welcome her into your life and hopefully she will be a precious part of your life for the rest of it,” Mary told me.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - For Noah McAdams, fighting cancer now also involves fighting the system.

Three-year-old Noah was recently diagnosed with leukemia, and while Tampa Bay area doctors recommended chemotherapy, his parents want a more organic approach to treating their young son's cancer.

One that includes cannabis, vitamins and a strict diet.

The Tampa toddler has already gone through rounds of chemo.

However, when the child's parents recently left Florida with him, en route to Ohio for a second opinion, they were stopped in Kentucky by law enforement.

Shortly after, they lost custody of Noah, who is now staying with his grandparents.

""In my opinion, if he stays separated from us, whether they follow through with traditional, modern medicine for him or not, then he is just going to be completely stressed out. And, honestly, it is going to kill him,"" Noah's mother, Taylor Bland, told WFLA Tuesday morning at a court hearing in downtown Tampa.

His parents say they're grateful that a Hillsborough judge is taking time in court to hear their concerns.

The judge did not make a final ruling on Tuesday, but instead ordered that the hearing be continued on Wednesday morning so additional doctors could testify.

""I am really thankful that the judge didn't make a decision today. That she is allowing more witnesses to come in, that she is allowing more information to be exposed about this treatment,"" Bland said.

One St. Petersburg dad knows exactly what Noah's parents are up against as they go through a difficult time.

Charles Gallagher's little girl, Caroline, battled leukemia at the same age.

""It's a diagnosis no one wants to get. I feel bad for the family. I feel bad for Noah. It tugs on your heartstrings. Absolutely, it's a tough diagnosis,"" Gallagher shared with WFLA.

After receiving chemotherapy, his daughter is now in remission at age 5.

""Chemo does what it's meant to do, chemo kills the cancer,"" he said. ""We were happy with the outcome. Caroline is cancer free.""

As an attorney, Gallagher understands both sides and is hoping Noah feels better soon.

""You can see the competing interest on one side, the best interest of the child, their welfare taken care of. Then, on the other side, parents should have some control over the health of their children,"" he said.

(Photo: TIM SHORTT/FLORIDA TODAY)

Waiting any amount of time for a needed organ can feel like a lifetime for patients and their families.

According to Donate Life America, more than 110,000 adults and children in the U.S. are awaiting organ transplants and another person is added to the transplant waiting list every 10 minutes.

Not all are able to receive organs in time, with 8,000 people dying each year, or 22 people each day, because the organs they need are not donated in time.

The need for organs stretches across demographics, with all races, ethnicities and age groups represented on the waitlist.

Infant gets a liver transplant

Rayna Kamon, 10, of Satellite Beach was just 2 months old when her parents, both medical professionals, realized something was wrong.

After a series of tests, the baby was diagnosed with biliary atresia, a rare disease that affects the drainage of bile from the liver in infants.

A surgery to fix the disease was unsuccessful. Five months after the diagnosis, Rayna was placed on a liver transplant list. Given her age and size, the pool of potential liver donors was small.

“Both her father and I worked with organ procurement agencies in our careers prior to having Rayna and always knew how special organ donation was,"" said Corrinne Kamon, Rayna’s mother. ""But being on the recipient side was eye opening.""

Just 11 days after being placed on the waitlist, the family received word that a potential donor liver could be a match. Seven-month-old Rayna was in surgery less than 24 hours later at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami.

“We were elated that she was going to have a chance at life but also extremely sad and distraught over knowing another child was gone and that the family was grieving,” Corrinne Kamon said. “We will always be in debt for the gift of life they gave at their darkest hour.”

Today, Rayna is a healthy 10-year-old with no obvious signs that she underwent such a life-altering experience as a baby. She speaks matter-of-factly of the surgery and of her belief that organ donation is the right choice.

“It’s so easy to register as an organ donor,” Rayna said.

The privacy of the donor is respected in transplant cases so it is common that recipients never learn the donor identities.

“We know that Rayna’s liver came from a 2-year-old boy in Georgia. I looked up news stories from around that time but have never been able to definitively figure out who her donor was,” Corrinne Kamon said.

Each year on the anniversary of Rayna’s transplant, she and her loved ones celebrate “liver day,” taking time to give thanks to the family of the donor.

“I try to think about that little boy and his family,"" Rayna said. ""I want them to know how thankful I am that I have life.""

Cancer survivor gets needed liver

Tom Stokes, 70, of Melbourne will celebrate the second anniversary of his liver transplant in July.

His need for a new liver stemmed from a case of hepatitis that was discovered after he donated blood in the early 1990s. Stokes treated the disease for 20 years and eventually developed liver cancer.

“I drank my last alcoholic drink in October of 2015. I was a moderate drinker, usually a beer or wine with friends,"" Stokes said. ""But I knew that if I was to ask for the gift of a new liver, I needed to commit to keeping it healthy.""

Already a runner, Stokes bumped up his fitness routine and added multi-sport components in an attempt to get his body in the best shape possible to withstand a likely liver transplant surgery and recovery.

In May of 2017, Stokes was officially added to the liver transplant list. Two months later, he received a call that he had been placed with a liver.

“I had completed a sprint triathlon that same morning. I showered and went to bed,"" Stokes recalled. ""Around 10:30 p.m. I got a call saying they had a liver for me that I needed to go right away.""

Stokes immediately went to the Transplant Institute at Advent Health in Orlando to prep for surgery. His wife, Deb Stokes, was visiting family out of state and hopped on the first flight she could find home.

The surgery lasted five hours and was completed without any complications.

For Stokes, the liver transplant sparked an even greater desire to push the limits of his healthy body, despite physician warnings that he may never be “100 percent” again.

“That really irked me when I was told that,” Stokes said. “I thought, well, what do you know? I’ll get back to better than 100 percent.”

Inspired to surpass expectations, he ran the Tailgate 2-miler race just six weeks after his surgery. In November of 2017, he ran the Space Coast Marathon relay, splitting the marathon course with his wife.

“At no point in my transplant journey was I afraid of dying,"" Stokes said. ""My biggest fear was losing the active lifestyle my wife and I had. I wanted to get back to it just as soon as I could.""

Today the couple is back to their normal routine, running and cycling with local groups several days a week and racing in some capacity nearly every weekend. Tom Stokes runs faster than he did pre-transplant. Both are advocates for organ donation.

“As sad as the circumstances typically are surrounding an untimely death, you can’t take it with you,” Tom Stokes said. “And what a gift of life to give to another family.”

Like the Kamons, Tom Stokes does not know the identity of his donor.

“I know he was younger than me at the time of the surgery but that is about all I know,” he said. “But I am forever thankful that he was an organ donor or that his family made that decision.”

CLEARWATER, Fla. - Jurors are deliberating the fate of a Florida man accused of throwing his 5-year-old daughter off a Tampa Bay area bridge.

The panel of seven men and five women was sent home after two hours on Monday evening. They returned Tuesday morning to continue weighing the case of John Jonchuck.

[PREVIOUS: Florida man who dropped daughter off bridge claims insanity | Insanity defense set for Florida man accused of dropping daughter off bridge]

During closing arguments on Tuesday, prosecutors said Jonchuck knew what he was doing when he dropped Phoebe Jonchuck 62 feet (18 meters) to her death four years ago. Defense attorneys say Jonchuck was insane at the time.

Jonchuck faces life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder. Jurors also could find him not guilty by reason of insanity and the judge could send him to a mental health center, where he could eventually be released if doctors deem him fit.

252,Auburndale couple on quest to adopt 'Baby Parker',"Christine Parker: “We're blessed with a lot of nieces and nephews, but it's in the back of your head, like, 'Am I ever going to be a mom?' ”

AUBURNDALE — For about a decade, Mother's Day has left Christine Parker feeling a bit empty.

The Auburndale resident is happy to honor her mother and the mother of her husband, Chris. As she gathers with relatives, she also pays tribute to in-laws and basks in the affection of their many children.

Yet Parker, 32, remains unfulfilled in her long-held desire to be a mother.

“It's really hard to see, 'Hey, here's your Mother's Day rose,' and I'm just sitting there like —” Parker said, making a pouty face. “We're blessed with a lot of nieces and nephews, but it's in the back of your head, like, 'Am I ever going to be a mom?' ”

The Parkers have known since before they married nearly a decade ago that they would be unable to have children of their own. After waiting to attain stability in their careers and finances, late last year they began exploring the idea of adoption, seeking an infant under 1 year old.

The couple is now dealing with the reality that becoming parents means raising a considerable sum of money. By using a private adoption agency, they say the process could cost $40,000 or more.

The Parkers created a Facebook page with the name Operation Find Baby Parker, and they have held yard sales and other efforts to generate money. But it's not clear if they will gather the needed funds in time to have a baby in their nursery for Mother's Day of 2020.

“We talked about it, and we knew it wasn't going to happen overnight,” Christine Parker said. “We thought probably the time frame — we were hoping in probably a year.”

Her husband added: “It'll probably take two.”

The couple said they have raised about $5,000 so far.

Delaying parenthood

Chris Parker, 36, said a doctor told him at around age 14 that he would be unable to father children. That was a result of heavy doses of medication, including steroids, that he received as a child to treat asthma and other health problems.

The couple, both Polk County natives, began dating about 15 years ago. Christine Parker said her husband informed her long before they were married that biological children would not be an option.

The Parkers delayed pursuing adoption as Christine completed her college degree and got established in her job as a teacher, now at Caldwell Elementary School. After that, the couple wanted to wait until they bought a house, a pursuit they completed last year.

Christine Parker said she has always had an affinity for children and decided as a girl that she wanted to become a teacher. She started babysitting as a teenager and worked in a daycare center throughout high school.

Parker said she and her husband both have a weakness for children, as evidenced by what they recognize is excessive bestowing of gifts upon Christine's godson.

“I just want to be able to have the love I see other mothers have when they hold their child or they go to their games,” she said. “I want to be able to experience that. I want to have those family moments and family vacations.”

Chris Parker, who works in a Publix food-production facility, said he has long wanted to be a father.

“I think it's pretty important to me because I've seen the love that my father and mother have given me, and I want to be able to do the same thing,” he said, “kind of teach them what I've been taught. Sort of like to live on the Parker legacy, I guess.”

Christine Parker has a brother with three children, and Chris has 15 nieces and nephews. The couple said they didn't discuss their inability to conceive children, even to most of their relatives, before going public last year.

One person who did know is Juliana Walker, Christine's best friend since they were students at Florida Southern College. Walker, also a teacher, said she was unable to get pregnant for the first years of her marriage even after undergoing fertility treatment and had all but given up on having children when she finally became pregnant in 2017.

“That was something we bonded over,” Walker said of their mutually childless years. “You want to celebrate your mom (on Mother's Day), but the feeling of, 'Well, that's not me and I don't get to celebrate that,' that's a hard thing to face. I remember many Mother's Days we would call each other and just talk about it.”

Christine Parker is godmother to Walker's 15-month-old son, Xander.

“Through having my son, we've continued to bond and she has seen what it's like to be able to be a mom and the joy that comes with it,” Walker said. “We talked about how great it would be if she did adopt and we could raise our kids together.”

Money shock

The Parkers began exploring private adoption agencies last year, and they said they were stunned to discover how much the process can cost.

Many factors combine to determine how much an agency charges adoptive parents, said Nicole Witt, executive director of the Adoption Consultancy in Brandon. She said those seeking to adopt must cover the prenatal costs for the pregnant woman, including medical care, legal costs, counseling and even travel costs and living expenses.

Adoption agencies also charge for home inspections, Witt said, and their fees cover overhead costs, including advertising and outreach. She said the typical cost of adopting through a private agency ranges from the low $30,000s to the high $40,000s.

“It's generally speaking not a process for people without money,” said Adam Pertman, president of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency. “The demographic of people who adopt an infant is high socio-economic status because it is expensive. Even if people are fundraising, they still have to get to that amount of money.”

Seeking to adopt a baby also involves financial risk. A pregnant woman who contracts with an adoption agency to make her baby available has the legal right to change her mind, even after giving birth. In Florida, the woman may sign a consent form to relinquish her parental rights either 48 hours after birth or after she is discharged from the hospital, but she faces no deadline for doing so.

If the woman decides to keep the baby, the prospective parents usually forfeit most of the money they have paid, Witt said. Some agencies will roll over some of their fees, she said, but payments devoted to the woman's pregnancy care can't be recovered.

“Every time we interviewed with adoption agencies, that was our first question,” Christine Parker said. “They would avoid answering it.”

Couples wishing to adopt have other options besides going through private agencies. Children in state custody are available for adoption through such nonprofits as Heartland for Children, which contracts with the Department of Children and Families in Polk, Hardee and Highlands counties.

Adopting a foster child costs “little or nothing,” DCF says in an overview on its website. The agency doesn't charge for home studies and parent training classes, and it reimburses court costs and legal fees for adoptive parents in financial need.

Launching operation

The Parkers said they considered adopting an older child in foster care but feel a strong desire to adopt a baby.

Only about 14,000 infants are voluntarily offered for adoption in the United States each year, Pertman said. Many more children in state protection or foster care are available to prospective parents. But Pertman said it's unfair to criticize parents like the Parkers for preferring to seek an infant.

He said couples who choose to have biological children could also be asked why they don't instead adopt an older foster child when so many often spent years waiting to join a permanent family.

Knowing it would take them years to save enough money to cover the adoption costs, the Parkers decided to seek help. In December, they created their Facebook page, which includes an 850-word statement that says, “We are on a journey to complete our story with our missing piece … a baby!”

The page, which has attracted more than 200 followers, includes a link that allows donations to be made through PayPal. The couple also had business cards printed with the phrase “Please help bring home Baby Parker,” along with the Facebook page address and an email address.

The Parkers chose to include a biblical verse from the book of 1 Samuel: “For this child I have prayed and the Lord has granted the desires of my heart.”

After consulting with friends and relatives, the Parkers began planning other ways of raising money toward their adoption costs.

In addition to those direct contributions, the couple has received many donations of items for the two yard sales they have held so far. As word has spread — particularly through the school system — the Parkers said people they didn't know have come forward to give them furniture, a TV, clothes, purses and toys, among other items.

Chris Parker said he rented a truck so that he and his father could drive around the county collecting all of the gifts, some of which they are keeping in two storage units. Other donated items, including a crib, a bassinet and a swing, have been installed in the couple's nursery.

The nursery is painted in neutral turquoise and gray, and the Parkers say they have no gender preference.

Unexpected support

Christine Parker has expressed her gratitude on the Facebook page for the donations.

“The support we've been getting since we made it public, we weren't even expecting that,” she said. “You have that thought, 'Nobody's going to donate,' but the outpouring of love and support we've got from not only the community but complete strangers, we are so grateful.”

As another fundraiser, the Parkers are selling pieces to a jigsaw puzzle (a symbol of their sense that a piece is missing from their lives). Buyers will write their names on the back of each piece, and the puzzle.

Witt said she has worked with many couples who needed to generate the money to cover adoption costs. She has seen prospective parents take out home-equity loans, cash-in retirement savings and receive early inheritance gifts from parents.

Witt said many couples engage in fundraising efforts similar to what the Parkers are doing — organizing yard sales, car washes, wine tastings, spaghetti dinners, run-walk events and auctions. She said others take on second jobs or rent out rooms in their homes.

Grants and other financial assistance are available from private foundations to cover at least part of the cost of adopting. The Parkers said they plan to investigate those possibilities.

When a couple seeks to adopt an infant, the dynamic is completely different than if they were choosing a foster child. It is the pregnant woman who decides which applicants to the agency she wants to receive the baby.

The Parkers recently had someone from the adoption agency conduct a home inspection, a procedure they said lasted more than four hours. Their next step will be to prepare a video that the agency will share with women planning to give their babies up for adoption.

It is a challenge for the Parkers to remain patient as they strive to gather the money they need to pay for an adoption. Walker said Christine Parker has drawn encouragement from the public response.

“I think because there's been such an overwhelming response, she can see how much people love her,” Walker said. “She just thought there wouldn't be much of a response because this is a personal issue and a lot of people always want to ask, 'Well, why don't you do this?' and 'Why don't you do that?' I try to just encourage her and show her you can clearly see this is God's plan for you because it's worked out perfectly.”

One of the items the Parkers have received is not intended for Baby Parker or for sale to generate money. It's a book, “I Wished for You: A Keepsake Adoption Journal.”

Christine Parker said she received the journal from a friend of a friend at one of the couple's yard sales. The woman arrived with her adopted son.

Parker said she will probably make the same gesture after she finds Baby Parker.

""I'll probably pass it along so people know they're not alone, there are other people who went through the process, and pretty much not to give up,"" she said.

253,"On Mother's Day, Daily News reporter Alexi Cardona reflects on her grandma's love","A few days before my paternal grandma passed away, she gave me a silver necklace with a marcasite butterfly pendant.

The day after we buried her, a butterfly came to the backyard of my family home in Hialeah. It fluttered near the areca palm trees lining the fence, then circled around and flew right over my head before disappearing into the níspero tree in my neighbors’ yard.

I like to believe that was her.

Abuela had been sick for some time, but it was still difficult to lose her. She had been in kidney failure, her lungs filling up with fluid.

My mom sent me a text the morning of March 20 that said my abuela was in serious respiratory distress. Her hospice nurse started giving her morphine.

I worried, or maybe I hoped, that March 20 was a false alarm. We'd had a few of those. I packed a bag in case of an emergency trip to Miami anyway and went to work.

I didn't understand what the morphine doses meant at first. My mom told me later in the day it meant the beginning of the end, that my grandmother would likely only be alive a few more days. Abuela didn’t want any more hospital stays or calls to 911. She wanted to die at home when the time came.

Then I thought about how I would feel if things took a turn and she died without my being able to see her alive for the last time. My boss let me go home.

I'm grateful I had the opportunity to spend the five days before my grandma's death with her and my family. Fingers twined, we watched news, telenovelas, a Spanish-language version of ""The Voice"" and obstacle course shows.

My grandma was afraid to sleep alone the last few nights before she died. My aunt and dad alternated staying with her, and I slept next to her the Friday before she passed. I told her it would be like the sleepovers she and I used to have when I was a girl, but we both knew it wasn't.

Abuela held my hand and pet my hair during her fitful sleep. The oxygen concentrator gave her a steady stream of air. I stayed up all night afraid of her taking her last breath next to me.

The morning of March 25, my dad sounded the alarm to everyone that abuela wasn’t doing well. He had spent the previous night with her, and she wasn’t particularly responsive when she woke up. Her breathing was harsh.

She died holding my grandpa’s hand. She was surrounded by family, and a Catholic priest read her last rites as she took her last breath. Despite all the traffic laws I broke that morning, I got to her house a few minutes too late to say goodbye. I’m still trying not to be devastated about that.

I hope she felt our love, especially during those last few days. She gave us her love in abundance.

If I believe in God, I have to believe she is OK and in a better place.

My grandma, Blanca Rosa Cardona, was born in Camajuaní in the Villa Clara province of central Cuba in June 1938. She was the youngest of four sisters and the daughter of a farmer.

She married my grandfather, Vicente Alberto Cardona Sr., in 1957. They had three children — my uncle Juan Vicente Cardona, dad Vicente Alberto Cardona Jr. and aunt Beatriz Rosalia Acevedo.

The five of them left the island in July 1971 under the Freedom Flights program, los vuelos de la libertad, a period of unusual Cuban and American government cooperation to manage the migration of Cubans to Miami.

By then, the Castro regime had seized the family’s livestock and would later seize their country house and farm.

Abuela and her family settled in Miami for good. They lived just southwest of Little Havana for some time before moving to the Coral Terrace neighborhood near West Miami.

Abuela is survived by my abuelo, two of her sisters, her children, three grandchildren and countless cousins, nieces, great-nieces, great-nephews and godchildren.

She worked for and retired from the U.S. Postal Service. Family lore has it that she worked so much overtime, she was able to pay off the mortgage on their house in a few years’ time.

I realize I don’t know much about my grandmother beyond who she was to me and my family. I regret not knowing about her upbringing and early life, what her hobbies were before she got married and had kids, what her aspirations and fears were. Whether she ever would have left her country if not for the communist regime that took over and took everything. I wish I’d had the forethought to do an oral history with her.

What I do know, though, is my abuela was the type of person to open her home to any family member who needed it. She took pride in her home, inside and out. She kept a clean, beautiful house and cooked good food despite her long overnight hours at work.

She didn’t allow sick or injured family members to be alone at home or in hospitals. When my mom was put on bedrest during her pregnancy with me, my grandmother cooked almost every day and visited my mom while my dad worked. She had a generous spirit and was meticulous in her giving.

CLOSE Mother's Day is coming up this Sunday, so now's your chance to brush up on your Mother's Day trivia with these 10 facts. 10Best Editors, USA TODAY 10Best

When my little brother Alejandro and I were kids, she gave us the best Easter Sunday of our lives. She covered every inch of her front lawn with plastic eggs filled with candy, dollar bills and coins. When we thought we were done, she turned our attention to the hedges that surrounded the front of her house. There were hundreds more eggs hidden.

My abuela showered us with love at every opportunity.

When I was in elementary school, my dad used to wake up for work way before dawn. He’d pack me and my little brother into his white pickup and take us to our grandparents’ house so I could get a couple of extra hours of sleep before school. Abuela would wake me up every weekday morning and let me sleep for 5 more minutes in her lap on the living room recliner. She’d then sit me at the kitchen counter and make my favorite breakfast — Keebler crackers with margarine and warm chocolate milk — before driving me to school and walking me to the entrance.

My abuela used to sew clothes in funky-patterned fabrics for me — sunflowers, sea creatures, fruits, polka dots and stripes. They were the only things I wanted to wear.

Photos: Love of music defines mother-daughter relationship

My summers in elementary and middle school were spent at abuelo and abuela’s house watching cartoons, playing board games and coloring. She’d sit side-by-side with me as we filled pages and pages of coloring books. She had a sense of color I've never had. Abuela rode out Hurricane Irma with my family at my parents’ house. When the power went out, we colored by lantern light.

Abuela played piano from a young age in Cuba and kept playing until she was too sick and her hands trembled too much to play. We could sometimes hear her music from the driveway when we went to visit.

My aunt and I made a memory board for the funeral. We covered a poster board with pictures of my grandma’s early life and her growing family through the years. You could see the changes over time.

Abuela used to be all big, pink cheeks, big glasses and big smiles. But she wasn’t the abuela I knew for about the past 12 years. Mental illness stole her smile and dimmed some of her light. We saw glimpses of her old self in her more manic periods. We completely lost her in her depressive periods.

One of the last full-length, clear conversations she and I had was about a year ago. We talked about our lifelong struggles with weight. I don’t remember what I told her, but she said in Spanish: “Even big girls are beautiful. Even big girls deserve love.” She made me believe that about myself.

I love my abuela because she did everything with purpose and wanted the people in her life to feel special. I love her because she had so much capacity for love and selflessness.

If there is one thing I have learned since her death, it’s to talk to the people you love about their lives. Listen to them. Learn their stories. Ask them how the good times and bad times in their lives made them who they are. Think about how the people you love have shaped you.

Portrait of Blanca Cardona (Photo: Handout)

My maternal grandmother, Eladia Inocencia Olea Cuesta, taught me how to hold a fork and knife and properly cut food. She taught me etiquette and instilled the lesson of saying please and thank you to everyone for everything. She taught my mom how to be strong, loyal, independent and fierce, all lessons my mom passed on to me and my brother. Abuelita Eladia, or Alla as we called her, even gave us our favorite saying: Canta para que tu mal espanta. Sing to scare your troubles away. She died about 17 years ago.

My paternal grandmother taught me how to be generous, kind, gracious and creative. Even when she was unwell, she was giving. When moved away from home to work at the paper, abuela packed up a box full of household items and knicknacks — a dish sponge, espresso cups, a first aid kit, sewing scissors, placemats, linens, a terracotta angel statue — and had my parents deliver it to me when I moved into my apartment. Little reminders of her are everywhere.

If you have lost a loved one, whether days, months or years ago, and still grieve, I’m with you.

Abuelas are something special. I was lucky to have mine for as long as I did. And I was tremendously fortunate mine were exceptional.

259,Circumstances of abuse involving werewolf mask not unique in Escambia County,"Videos allegedly depicted a 37-year-old man sending bursts of electricity into the 2-year-old body of a little girl, filming himself chasing her with his face hidden behind a werewolf mask as she screamed.

The extremity of the abuses that Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius is accused of committing against his live-in girlfriend’s daughter can make the details of the allegations appear unprecedented in their depravity.

But Gulf Coast Kid’s House Executive Director Stacey Kostevicki does not view the abuse allegations as being exceptionally unique.

“The bottom line is all abuse is the exertion of power and control,” Kostevicki said. “What better way to exert power and control, than to do it when a child is sleeping.”

New details: In wolf mask and Batman PJs, Pensacola man tortured child for cameras, report says

According to Kostevicki, one of the most common perpetrators of child abuse is the boyfriend of a single mother.

The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office announced last week that deputies had arrested and charged Celaius with abusing his live-in girlfriend’s 2-year-old daughter.

Sheriff David Morgan referred to Celaius' alleged abuses — which included shocking the child with an electric dog collar, shooting her with a BB gun, throwing milk bottles at her head as she nodded off to sleep and throwing a house cat on her face once she had fallen asleep — as “systematic torture.”

The specific factors, like wearing a werewolf mask, are, to say the least, uncommon. However, the case against Celaius fits a pattern of circumstances all too common in Escambia County.

Arrest: Pensacola man accused of 'systematic torture' and 'indescribable' abuse of 2-year-old

“When you move in with a person, the move provides 24-hour access to the child,” Kostevicki said.

Where the number of child abuse cases have fallen at the national level in recent years, they have risen in Escambia County, she noted.

Kostevicki speculated highly publicized abuse cases, like those involving R. Kelly and Larry Nassar, have turned into engrossing scandals that brought new awareness to child abuse. That awareness, she believes, has led to more abuse cases being reported across the country.

In Escambia County in 2018, one out of 11 children were involved in an allegation of abuse, Kostevicki said. These numbers have risen in recent years.

In 2014, one out of 14 children were involved in an allegation of abuse, according to the Department of Children and Families.

“With us, I do think poverty plays a role,” she said. “Families are more likely to move in with each other — single moms are more willing to move in with their boyfriends — if they can’t afford to live separately.”

Boyfriends of single mothers are definitely not the only perpetrators of child abuse in Escambia County. But Kostevicki said mothers moving in with significant others should be vigilant about protecting their child from any potential harm.

In 97% of child abuse cases seen by the Gulf Coast Kid's House, the abuser is a family member or a trusted family friend.

“We would advise parents, particularly moms who are considering moving in with a boyfriend, to be particularly vigilant about making sure they know that person is safe,” Kostevicki said. “If there are multiple kids in the household, be aware if the boyfriend is wanting to hang out with one of the children more than the rest or give only one of the children gifts.”

The Gulf Coast Kid’s House, along with its partners, provided services to over 3,015 children in the 2017-2018 fiscal year. Out of its 643 interviews with kids and 660 medical assessments of children, the Gulf Coast Kid’s House found indications of child abuse in 78% of its assessments.

260,Invest in the future by investing in young adults | Opinion,"CLOSE 25 women you need to know: Alexandria Washington

Amid the shade of Tallahassee's beautiful trees and the lure of our great colleges and universities, you will find the city’s most valuable resource — the youth. Leon County is home to almost 25,000 youths ages 10-17, a forgotten treasure vital to the livelihood of this North Florida city.

On January 16, at the Smith-Williams Service Center, Mayor John Dailey and a newly elected City Commission discussed many community-driven issues that would now be the focus of city government. The most important was economic development —impacting residents’ quality of life, and more specifically, their financial stability.

If we are to truly take steps toward improving the quality of life for all city residents and eradicating poverty, we must begin with educating and equipping our youth with skills and opportunities. After all, they are the city’s next workforce, impacting its economic future.

Talent retention and job skills training should not be restricted to college students and adults, but made available to those in high school. Investing in youth employment programs like Leon County’s Summer Youth Training Program, the Tallahassee Engaged in Meaningful Productivity for Opportunity — known as TEMPO — and youth employment initiatives with CareerSource helps to ensure opportunities for the youth are available.

Like many nurturing young girls, Alexandria Washington had dreamt of becoming a nurse. The California-born athletically-inclined girl loved the idea of helping others.

The city’s Tallahassee Future Leaders Academy, a comprehensive summer youth employment program, is providing teens with transferable skills and employment opportunities.

Last summer, this comprehensive program provided nearly 240 young adults with employment, financial literacy, job readiness training and college campus enrichment, including tours of Florida A&M University, Florida State University and Tallahassee Community College.

According to information found on Talgov.com, throughout its four years, Tallahassee Future Leaders Academy has served more than 600 youths who have earned over 1,000 professional certifications.

Participants in the program represented an average of 62% single parent households, 47% below federal poverty level and 60% below Asset Limited Income Constrained Employed level.

The program has won three major honors for the city: the National League of Cities’ Cultural Diversity Award, the International City/County Management Association’s Community Partnership Program Excellence Award and the City Livability Award from the United States Conference of Mayors, along with an Outstanding Achievement Award.

All this because the city formed innovative partnerships with local private businesses, universities and nonprofits with one objective — positively impacting our youth and broadening their experiences.

In 2015, the city of Tallahassee was recognized as an All-America City for its successful use of civic engagement, collaborations and inclusiveness to address local issues. The question for 2019 is: How do remain an All-America City?

To start, we must continue to promote and advance programs designed to educate, train and empower youth. But we can’t just say that we are doing these things — we must put our money where our mouth is by allocating funds, hiring additional staff and garnering support from our elected officials.

If we are serious about addressing the quality of life and poverty, we must begin today by investing in tomorrow’s future.

Alexandria Washington is an award winning health advocate who holders a Master degree in Public Health. She is the Tallahassee Ambassador for United State of Women and a board member of New Leaders Council Tallahassee.

261,"It's part boat, part car and all fun. Meet the captain of Pensacola's boat car","Gerry Moore gets a lot of strange looks when he's out driving his Ford Expedition.

People roll down their windows, stick their phones out and take photos. Others slam on the brakes to do a double-take. Pedestrians walking by stand open-mouthed, then quickly reach into their bags to get their cameras.

Gerry is a good-looking guy, always wearing a white sailor's cap and he usually has a cigar dangling from his lips. His wife, Karen, is blonde and beautiful, and is usually sitting in the passenger's seat, waving at onlookers. Maybe that's why everyone wants to take photos.

Or perhaps it's because Gerry sawed off the top half of his Ford Expedition and replaced it with the top half of a 1986 Chris Craft Scorpion 210, an old boat he had sitting in his backyard for years.

""It definitely gets a reaction out of people,"" Gerry says with a laugh. ""Everybody smiles, they really do.""

""It's such a joy to see people's reactions,"" Karen says. ""They either have their camera out, or they're smiling and waving. Many of them just bust out laughing.""

Yes, it drives just like a car, and no, it doesn't float

Gerry first got the idea to build his ""boat car,"" as he calls it, at a car show in Mississippi late last year.

He saw a similar, smaller car/boat hybrid, and thought of the old Chris Craft he had sitting in his backyard off of Nine Mile Road in Pensacola. He'd been mulling refurbishing the boat for years, but never got around to spending the money to bring it back to life.

""So when I saw that boat car, I told my wife, 'That's what we're doing with our boat,'"" Gerry says. ""She said, 'I don't know how you are going to do that.'""

Gerry, who works as a poker dealer at the Pensacola Greyhound Track, grew up fixing cars with his dad in Little Rock, Arkansas. His dad owned several car service stations, and Gerry has always been comfortable tinkering with automobiles.

But his boat car project was one that he'd never done before. He measured his Cadillac Escalade and his boat and determined they'd be the perfect fit for one another, but Karen wouldn't let him chop the Escalade to pieces. So he found an old Ford Expedition that had front end damage and bought it for cheap.

""I didn't mind that it had front end damage,"" Gerry says. ""I cut the whole front end off anyways.""

Gerry worked for six weeks merging the boat and car together — ""That Chris Craft was built a little too good, I went through about 20 saws just to get the bottom off,"" he says — and eventually his masterpiece was complete. The boat car has the wheels, bottom frame, seats and steering wheel of the Expedition, but the body of the Chris Craft. It seats eight people and gets about 20 miles to the gallon.

And no, it doesn't float.

Gerry and Karen took the boat car, which they named ""Tsunami,"" for its first spin in Pensacola on Feb. 15, and the farthest he's driven since then is to Panama City and back. The boat car operates and drives just like an SUV and is licensed and insured as the Expedition. Gerry says he's been pulled over by the police ""around 10 times"" — but instead of writing him a ticket, they snap a picture.

""It's considered a Ford Expedition, with a slight body modification,"" he says with a laugh.

A lot of looks, laughs and smiles from perfect strangers

So, what's the point of spending six weeks creating a boat/car hybrid that Gerry and Karen just drive around for fun?

They both say it's the reactions they get from people that make it worthwhile.

Gerry survived thyroid cancer that metastasized to his lungs, and Karen is a two-time breast cancer survivor. They both still work, and are busy with three kids and nine grandkids. But they enjoy driving the boat car around in their free time, taking photos with people and giving rides to people to see the joy that it brings.

""I can have a rough day at work, and when I get home, he'll say, 'Let's go for a ride,'"" Karen says.

Gerry ordered several captains hats, like the one he wears, to give out to little kids who are fascinated by the boat car. One interaction with a little girl at a car show a few weeks ago still makes him tear up when he talks about it.

""There was a little girl who had leukemia, so I put her in the boat and gave her a captain's hat,"" Gerry says. ""Seeing a reaction like that in a child is no different than seeing these bums on the corner who have no food or anything else. Everybody's response is to wave and smile, and it just makes their day. And more importantly, it makes ours.""

""It tickles them to death to see the boat,"" Karen says of the little kids. ""And to have a hat like he has, that makes it so much more special.""

The Moores are open to the idea of letting people ""rent"" the boat car (with Gerry as its captain) for weddings or other events. It made its first big public debut at the Pensacola Grand Mardi Gras parade in March.

But for the most part, the Moores aren't looking to make a monetary profit off their ride. The reward they get from it is driving down Palafox Street and having people stop on the sidewalks to take photos, or pulling up next to people at stoplights and having the cars next to them roll down their windows to ask questions and laugh. The boat car makes people happy — and that's what makes Gerry and Karen happy, too.

""One time we pulled in by the beach ball (water tower) here on Pensacola Beach,"" Gerry says. ""And seven Marines came up to me and said, 'You just made our whole vacation.' You can't put a price on reactions like that.""

The win gave her an instant ticket to the national competition this summer, even though she doesn’t compete in the state competition until Mother’s Day weekend. As the reigning Miss Majorette of Florida, she will be competing to defend her state title.

“She has been twirling for eights years and it’s been awesome to see her grow,” her mom, Maile, said. “I’ve seen her drive to succeed, not just to win. She does her best whether it’s in individuals or a team event.”

All five Epic Twirl teams also qualified to compete at the national level.

To defend her title, DeLand must present a two to three minute solo performance, a fancy strut marching routine, a modeling routine and a talent other than twirling which will be an acro dance routine.

“I’m really happy that I get to advance to the next level,” DeLand said. “I’ve worked really hard and am working towards becoming Miss Pre-Teen Majorette Queen at nationals.”

According to her coach, Cheri Howard, DeLand is known for being the girl with the best attitude and a team player.

“I really can’t say enough good things about her,” Howard said. “She never gives me attitude, she works hard and she’s determined. She’s advanced a lot faster because of it. She has made lots of friends at all the competitions and is kind to everyone. And on top of her talent, she’s very smart.

267,Mental health and children in SWFL: Special report on a growing crisis,"The first in an occasional series of children’s mental health in Southwest Florida. Read our editor’s note for more information and join us as we explore solutions on this important topic.

A LaBelle teenager was doing homework in her room last fall when her mind drifted to worries, dark thoughts and doubts about the future.

The 16-year-old carried a heavy load of honors and college classes and had dreams of becoming a doctor. Good grades seemed like the path to escape the financial struggles of her father, a landscaper, and her mother, a dialysis technician.

Will I have a future? What will I do with it? Is it even worth it? Am I worth it?

She felt so tired. She brought a stashed razor blade to her wrist and cut, something she had done before.

For years, she had hidden her cutting by covering up her scars. But two days after that incident last fall, her parents learned of her injuries. She told them she didn’t want to die.

Within two hours, the family was at Golisano Children’s Hospital of Southwest Florida in south Fort Myers.

It would take days before space in an emergency mental health center, known as a crisis stabilization unit, became available anywhere in South Florida to treat the real reason for the girl’s potentially deadly injuries.

“That was alarming,” said Edith Ortiz, the girl's mother. “You have Naples. You have Fort Myers. You have the west coast. They told me it could be all the way up in Tampa. They did not have one bed in three days.”

The News-Press agreed not to fully identify the girl because she is a minor and her family worries about the negative consequences of sharing her ongoing struggle.

Finally, a spot opened in Bradenton — more than 100 miles away from home.

Problem outpaces population growth

More than a decade ago, Southwest Florida community leaders declared the shortage of mental health services, particularly for children, as one of the region’s most pressing problems.

Since that time, the number of children harming themselves, threatening or attempting suicide, and seeking mental health care has far outpaced population growth.

Mental health evaluations for children under the state’s Baker Act have more than doubled between 2011 and 2017 in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties, state records show. The need has outstripped the rate of population growth: Lee County, for example, grew 17.1 percent during the same period.

About 2,000 children a year in the region are now subject to such examinations, which are designed to stabilize people in immediate danger of harming themselves or others.

Baker Acts referrals for children while in school, a rarity in the early 2000s, now happen hundreds of times a year, even at the elementary school level, according to records from sheriffs' offices. Some schools average several such cases a month.

And, while local mental health treatment services continue to expand, providers in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties struggle to keep up with demand and sometimes can’t treat children in immediate crisis.

This troubling rise comes amid national jumps in diagnosed anxiety and suicide attempts among children. Experts can’t fully explain why this is happening but say social media, bullying, school pressures, and increased awareness and acceptance of mental illness are likely contributing.

This growing Southwest Florida medical crisis falls to a local health care and social service system stymied by low funding, fragmentation, turf battles and uncertainty about how to deal with the problem.

Two suicides this year of survivors of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland have amplified the need to do more. In March, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for government action on mental health.

Even so, Florida has long ranked at or near the bottom in spending for per-person state-managed mental health programs.

Although the state is far from impoverished, it still acts like it when it comes to mental health, said Kevin Lewis, who led mental health and substance abuse agencies in Fort Myers for decades. Lewis now sits on a regional board overseeing the region’s public mental health treatment services.

“Behavioral health care has been rationed during my entire career and it’s always a horrible situation,” he said. “With many things, we would not tolerate that. Imagine if you had diabetes and there was a six-month wait for insulin?”

It's hard to pinpoint why state funding has historically been scarce, but child welfare experts floated possibilities such as the political influence of older voters who may be removed from the reality of children's needs and a state mental health budget that has grown piecemeal rather than by priorities and needs.

Crisis units often crowded

Southwest Florida’s three closest crisis units for children — SalusCare Fort Myers, the David Lawrence Center in East Naples and Charlotte Behavioral Health in Punta Gorda — collectively have space for little more than 40 children at any time. They commonly face crowding.

SalusCare operated above its funded capacity on average 39 percent of the time last year, or 142 days of the year, according to data obtained from the Central Florida Behavioral Health Network, which oversees publicly funded mental health services in this region.

The East Naples unit also had an average 39 percent rate during that same time.

Charlotte Behavioral Health, which has the region’s largest children’s unit, was above capacity an average 14 percent of the time, or 52 days.

Crisis centers work to avoid turning away children if possible. For instance, the David Lawrence Center sets up extra cots in common areas during busy times, administrators say.

“It happens a lot, a little more during season,” said Tamara Glynn, the center’s acute care director. “We have more need than we have rooms for, unfortunately.”

Even those who receive crisis treatment often wait days or, in some circumstances, weeks — and return to the hospital or Baker Act units because they have trouble accessing follow-up care.

A 2017 state report pointed to several factors contributing to the rise of children in mental health crisis. Those included: “waiting lists for services, limitations on coverage or approval, limited or no funding for prevention and diversion services, and a shortage of psychiatrists and other professionals.”

“The Task Force concluded that Florida is not adequately investing in its children, youth, and families,” said the Florida Department of Children & Families report.

Southwest Florida mental health providers echoed those findings. They described a system focused on crises, such as self-harm requiring hospitalization and suicide threats, and one that is woefully lacking in prevention, such as mental health screenings and quick access to affordable counseling and psychiatric care.

Services have expanded some in recent years. But few providers think it's enough to meet ever increasing demands.

“The situation here is dire,” said Christina Hansen, a Fort Myers psychologist. Edith Ortiz said Hansen is treating her daughter, the LaBelle teenager mentioned at the beginning of this story.

Elite DNA Therapy Services, a large private provider that accepts all insurances, said the number of appointments for Southwest Florida children more than doubled from 25,000 in 2016 to about 60,000 in 2018.

Top diagnoses for those appointments were attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and insomnia.

Elite DNA employs 47 therapists, including 10 licensed clinical social workers, and 18 psychiatric providers who see children. Of those 18, four are psychiatrists. The rest are nurse practitioners and physicians assistants paired with a psychiatrist because of the ""extreme"" shortage of child psychiatrists, company leaders said.

“We could bring in five psychiatrists and 10 social workers and there would still be an issue because there’s been so much need for so long,” said Elizabeth Dosoretz, Elite DNA founder.

Too ashamed to tell parents

The morning after cutting her wrist, the teenager chose a long-sleeved shirt for church.

It was the third time she had attempted suicide in the past year or so, but she was too ashamed to tell her parents.

Twice she had cut her wrists; another time she swallowed some random pills she had found in the house. None of the earlier attempts ever required hospitalization or alerted her family to her problem.

Depression and anxiety were just problems they never talked about, she said, particularly because the subject of mental health remains taboo among many Mexican-Americans.

Over dinner that Sunday, the high school junior considered how her death would affect her family, her two little brothers especially.

Maybe I’m still here for a reason.

At some point before dawn, she pulled a pillow and blanket into the laundry room leading to the back door, knowing she'd catch her mother as she left early for work. She planned to tell her everything.

""Are you OK?,"" her mother asked when she saw her daughter on the floor.

Her daughter still couldn't open up. ""I have a stomach ache.""

But a few hours later, her little brother found a bloody towel and showed their father. He called Edith Ortiz at work and passed her daughter the phone. She said she needed help.

“I do it so that I don’t feel anything,"" the girl later explained. ""I overthink things too much, and all these emotions are in your head. I just don’t want to do anything. I don’t want to feel anything. I just want to be numb.”

Ortiz rushed home from her job in Clewiston and, with her husband and their 6-year-old son, drove more than an hour from LaBelle to Golisano.

Doctors checked the girl’s wounds and ran a battery of tests to make sure she hadn’t taken drugs. They told her she would need a psychiatric examination at a state-approved facility that received individuals under the Baker Act.

Hospital staff could not find a space for her in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties. They called centers as far as Orlando and Miami, the family said.

Nothing was available. She would have to wait. No one knew how long.

Thousands go to hospital ERs

Hospitals increasingly find themselves on the front lines of the region’s mental health crisis.

Between 2005 and 2015, more than 31,000 children showed up in ERs in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties with diagnosable mental illnesses — from substance addiction to severe anxiety and depression, according to non-identifiable patient discharge records obtained by The News-Press.

The number who reported suicidal thoughts or had committed serious self-harm, such as cutting, went up at least 50 percent between 2005 and 2015, those records show. That now translates into roughly 300 children a year.

Hospital staff sometimes struggle to find crisis centers with room to take them. Records from Lee Health, the largest hospital operator between Tampa and Miami, show that an average of 1-in-10 pediatric ER patients subject to Baker Act evaluations had to use crisis centers outside their home counties over the past decade.

As many as a quarter of children have had to use out-of-town crisis units during certain stretches of busy months, medical staff say.

The vast majority of these Lee Health patients are in low-income families who are uninsured or are covered by Medicaid.

“They don’t always have transportation readily available,” said Armando Llechu, chief administrative officer of Golisano Children’s Hospital, which Lee Health operates. “And now, for at least the next 72 hours for the Baker Act period, three days, they’re basically going to have to travel to Tampa and back to visit their child, participate in group therapy sessions, and speak to the physicians.”

Waiting and watched

For Edith Ortiz’s daughter, the time at Golisano was stretches of boredom punctuated by episodes of “Law & Order.” She wasn’t allowed on computers or phones and couldn't do school work. She worried her grades would drop and ruin her chances at a good college.

Hospital volunteers known as “sitters” kept constant watch. One pulled her chair over to an open bathroom to watch her shower. A hospital social worker kept her apprised of crowding at crisis units.

“She just kept telling me that she was calling places and that there were no open spots and that, supposedly, there were going to be open spots the next day,” the girl said. “She kept trying and trying and trying.”

Another surprise: The social worker warned that if the girl were transported to SalusCare, the Lee County Sheriff’s Office would, according to its own policy, handcuff her for the trip. This didn't bother the girl as much as it did her mother, who thought the system was punishing her daughter for seeking help.

""I didn't really do it to cover up the scars, but I did it to give people something to stare at."" Amanda Inscore/The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA

Lee Health has no psychiatrists on staff or on call for patients showing up in the ER after suicide attempts, administrators said. Nor does it plan to add such staffing, because they are already available at crisis stabilization units, Llechu said.

The delayed mental health treatment was also unexpected to Ortiz, who is studying to be a nurse.

“If you have somebody coming into your ER with a heart attack, are you going to wait and see and study everything why you had the heart attack? No, you’re going to treat the heart attack right there and then.”

The family’s wait ended after two days. Sometime around 1 a.m., the girl was rousted. A spot had opened in Bradenton. She would have to leave immediately.

The girl was strapped in a gurney and placed in an ambulance around 3 a.m. It would be a two-hour trip.

Not enough screening or doctors

Treatment providers say the region’s mental health system is largely focused on crises, such as self-harm requiring hospitalization and threats of suicide.

But they say it’s failing when it comes to preventive mental health screenings and easy access to affordable counseling and psychiatric care. And demand is quickly rising.

The behavioral health team with Lee Physician Group, an outpatient medical group Lee Health operates, saw 1,088 patient visits in 2017. Lee Health projects that number will be nearly 12,000 this year.

Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties each have roughly one mental health provider of any type per 1,000 residents, compared with the Florida average of one per 670 people, according to a University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute analysis of the nation’s health care this year.

The top-performing U.S. counties, particularly some affluent and highly populated areas of the nation, have an average ratio of 310-to-1.

For more than a decade, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry has sounded alarms about the shortage of child psychiatrists.

There are about 8,300 practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists in the United States to serve more than 15 million children in need, it notes. The academy points to factors swaying medical students from the path, including educational debt, long training requirements, and insurance reimbursement hassles.

For providers overall, pay can be a problem. It's tough for local mental health agencies dependent on public funding to be competitive.

“Sometimes we are not as competitive as we would like to be, so that opens up the window a bit for some staff to look elsewhere,” said Stacey Cook, president and CEO of SalusCare. “We serve a largely indigent and underinsured population, so it can make it difficult to stay competitive.”

Funding initiatives

The news is not all bad.

Millions in state funding for mental health services is filtering into Southwest Florida in the wake of the 2018 killings in Parkland. As part of that, the state created mobile crisis units designed to respond to young people in mental health crises within 60 minutes.

Lee and Collier wine festivals have made raising money for children's mental health services a priority.

Collier County agencies, for several years, have collaborated to reach at-risk children before they are in crises through the Beautiful Minds initiative, organized and supported by the Naples Children & Education Foundation, the philanthropy arm of the Naples Winter Wine Festival. The foundation counts more than 55,200 youth who received services and treatment since the initiative began.

Another fundraising effort, the Kids’ Minds Matter campaign in Lee County, aims to raise $10 million over the next three years to finance more programming and mental health providers.

Lee Health also recently announced a new pediatric mental health screening program for a select group of children on its “Vivida” Medicaid managed-care program, though they are likely to number in the hundreds.

A broader program it has participated in for years provides basic mental health training to pediatricians to help them spot problems early.

But all of this is unlikely to be enough, said Paul Simeone, Lee Health’s recently hired medical director for behavioral and mental health.

“It’s fairly shocking, really, that people get as little coverage as they do down here,” said Simeone, who last worked for a Boston health system. “One of the things I’m concerned about, as we screen more people is: Are we going to have enough resources for them?”

Children can get better when they can get the care they need. The News-Press spoke to several teenagers who healed with medication, therapy or both.

Whether they get that care often depends on their parents. Getting the correct diagnosis and finding the right therapist can be trial-and-error and take months, even years. The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry notes average delays of up to 10 years between the start of symptoms and treatment.

Another factor: the child's willingness to engage.

Many children’s mental health providers and community leaders have tried to respond to the rising number of children in need.

SalusCare expanded its children's crisis unit from 12 to 16 beds in 2016. The David Lawrence Center in East Naples doubled its capacity from four to eight about the same time and is now planning possibly three to five more beds. Charlotte Behavioral Health Care doubled the number of children's beds to 20 in 2017.

Finally, an outpatient appointment

Edith Ortiz scanned the waiting room of the LaBelle mental health clinic.

It was November, nearly two months after her daughter was released from the Bradenton crisis unit. The dim room contained mostly adults. A middle-aged woman, appearing to be the throes of a drug withdrawal, trembled and scratched.

Where in the world did I bring my daughter?

Still, she was grateful. This was the first outpatient mental health appointment she could get for her daughter.

The Bradenton crisis unit had given her daughter lithium, a powerful antidepressant commonly prescribed to people at risk for suicide. The drug mostly just made her daughter sleepy.

This clinic offered a different approach and prescribed her a month’s supply of low-dose Prozac. The provider urged her to participate in group therapy.

Clinic staff promised to call soon to schedule another appointment. They never did. No one called back despite Ortiz’s repeated attempts. Later, she would learn the clinic had closed.

The family had found a good psychologist in Fort Myers and were happy to drive up to two hours each week for the appointments. The therapy was helping her cope with the anxiety and depressive disorder, her diagnoses. But psychologists, who don't have medical degrees, can't prescribe medication.

On New Year's Day, her daughter got a sunflower tattoo over the scars on her wrist.

""I did it to give people something to stare at because I thought, 'Well, if you’re going to stare, why not stare at something nice.' ""

In February, the family managed to secure a psychiatric appointment in Fort Myers. She was seen quickly and received new prescriptions they hope will work. After months of struggle, it felt like a new start.

268,Deadly April storms leaves trail of damage across Florida,"The Leon County Sheriff's Office said an 8-year-old girl was killed and a 12-year-old boy was injured when a tree hit this mobile home in Woodville, just south of Tallahassee.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A line of severe thunderstorms and possible tornados barreled across North Florida on Friday morning, leaving at least one child dead and a second injured near Tallahassee. The front facade of a furniture store in Kingsland, Georgia, was ripped off by high winds and a tractor-trailer was blown over on the causeway to St. Simons Island.

An 8-year-old girl was killed and a 12-year-old boy was injured when a massive oak tree fell through their mobile home in Woodbine about 8 a.m. The Leon County Sheriff's Office said a 12-year-old boy was also injured. Their father and two other children were unhurt, but a GoFundMe post set up for the family said that the home house was demolished.

A tree also came down on a mobile home near Live Oak, but there were no injuries were reported. There were hundreds of reports of trees, limbs and powerlines down across the News4Jax viewing area.

Authorities said straight-line winds were responsible for blowing the front wall off the Badcock Furniture in Kingsland. A viewer who sent a photo of the damage reported seeing a funnel coming from the clouds.

""This was after what looked to be a tornado hovered over the store and receded back into the sky,” Rhonda Askin wrote.

Baker County Fire-Rescue reported that two people injured when an SUV went off a slick road and hit a tree in Glen St. Mary, near the Florida-Georgia border.

Most people's brush with the storm was downed limbs, trees and powerlines.

Tammie's Kane's car parked near the intersection of King Street and Riverside Avenue was damaged when a tree fell on it.

""It came on fast. It started raining and it was pretty windy and then, boom, right after that the tree fell,"" she said. ""Cars can be fixed and replaced and people can’t.""

The Clay County Sheriff's Office reported road underwater and with trees, power lines and debris down. They urge people to report serious damage to the authorities and drive with extra care.

A Southwest Airlines flight from Nashville to Jacksonville was reported to have been struck by lightning before landing safely just before 11 a.m. The flight was scheduled to continue on to Fort Lauderdale but an airline spokeswoman told News4Jax the plane was taken out of service for a maintenance review.

A passenger on the plane said they weren't told about a lightning hit. The only thing he noticed on the approach to JAX was excess turbulence.

About a dozen other flights to and from Jacksonville were either canceled or delayed Friday due to weather, which is bad across a wide swath of the eastern United States.

Florida State University and Florida A&M, both in Tallahassee, didn't open until noon Friday, when the heavy weather had passed. Santa Fe College in Gainesville closed at midday, asking all students and staff to shelter in place. NAS Jacksonville sent nonessential employees home at 1 p.m.

About 1:30 p.m., Clay Electric reported 13,553 power outages between Alachua, Baker, Clay, Columbia and Union counties. JEA reported more than 7,000 customers out during the noon hour, but the number was under 1,000 by 1:30 p.m. Florida Power and Light was reporting isolated outages scattered across its north Florida coverage area.

270,Florida House OKs bill requiring parental abortion consent,"The measure sponsored by GOP Rep. Erin Grall of Vero Beach would require that a minor get written, notarized permission from a parent or a legal guardian to obtain an abortion. Florida now only requires that parents be notified that their child is seeking an abortion.

TALLAHASSEE — Legislation that would require consent from a parent or guardian before a girl under 18 could obtain an abortion passed the Florida House on Wednesday night after a lengthy debate and amid questions about its constitutionality.

The Republican-led House voted 69-44 largely along party lines for the bill, which now moves to the Senate where a similar bill is pending.

The measure sponsored by GOP Rep. Erin Grall of Vero Beach would require that a minor get written, notarized permission from a parent or a legal guardian to obtain an abortion. Florida now only requires that parents be notified that their child is seeking an abortion.

""The reason that a child should seek the consent of their parent is because the parent is in the most unique and beneficial position to advise that child,"" Grall said during more than three hours of debate. ""Overwhelmingly, parents could offer a perspective, and advice and counsel, that is not available from any other person.""

The measure also provides that a minor could ask a circuit court judge to waive the parental consent provision under certain circumstances, such as when a girl is a child abuse or sexual abuse victim. That is similar to the current parental notification law; in 2017, out of about 1,500 abortions in Florida involving minor girls there were 205 judicial waivers granted, Grall said.

The bill would allow girls to be represented by an attorney for free when seeking a waiver.

Democrats generally opposed the bill, contending among other things that not all children are comfortable with telling parents they are pregnant and in some cases might face reprisals, ridicule or even violence.

""If she's old enough to become a mother, she's old enough to make the decision of the right path for herself,"" said Rep. Tina Polsky, a Boca Raton Democrat.

A previous such law was ruled unconstitutional in 1989 by the Florida Supreme Court on privacy rights grounds and many Democrats said this bill might meet the same fate. But the high court now has a more conservative bench with three new justices appointed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that could change a future outcome.

""Simply put, this bill is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Florida has already ruled on this exact point,"" said Democratic Rep. Joe Geller of Dania Beach. ""Why are we doing it again?""

The bill also increases penalties for health practitioners who violate current law requiring that an infant born alive during an abortion must be cared for and taken to a hospital. The penalty for violations would go from a misdemeanor to a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190417/florida-house-oks-bill-requiring-parental-abortion-consent?rssfeed=true,2019-04-17T20:37:25Z,News Chief,Couple,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881

279,Sex cult leader on trial says he just wanted to create a 'secret society of women',"Advertisement Sex cult leader on trial says he just wanted to create a 'secret society of women' Share Shares Copy Link Copy

The members of the upstate New York group called Nxivm looked up to Keith Raniere as a leader who spread his ideas on how to achieve success and happiness, but prosecutors say, he was actually a conman who took advantage of vulnerable people.""He targeted people who were looking to improve their lives,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Tanya Hajjar in her opening statement Tuesday at Raniere's trial in New York City. ""Once he gained their trust he took advantage of them. The defendant said that he was a mentor, but he was a predator.""Raniere, 58, has been charged with racketeering, sex trafficking, sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking, among other offenses. He has been held in federal custody in Brooklyn since his arrest in Mexico in March 2018. On Tuesday, he appeared in court wearing a gray sweater with a button down shirt, seated next to his attorney Marc Agnifilo.""I certainly agree with one thing,"" Agnifilo said in his own opening statement, in response to claims raised by the prosecution. ""You are going to hear the truth.""Agnifilo argued that the prosecution's own witnesses will testify that they loved being part of Nxivm -- an organization that prosecutors have deemed a pyramid scheme but others call a cult.Nearly 17,000 people took the self-help classes that Nxivm offered, Agnifilo said, and he urged the 12 jurors to look at the facts of the case through Raniere's perspective.Raniere's five other co-defendants have pleaded guilty and might testify against their former mentor. Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, ""Smallville"" actress Allison Mack, Kathy Russell, Lauren Salzman and Nancy Salzman have pleaded guilty to crimes ranging from visa fraud to racketeering.One former Nxivm member, identified only as Sylvie to protect her identity, began testifying Tuesday afternoon about coercion she said she experienced while part of the organization.Raniere has pleaded not guilty to all charges. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.Recruits provided 'collateral' information, prosecutors sayNxivm, created by Raniere in 2003, exploited recruits ""both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants' benefit,"" said U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue.An affidavit prepared by an FBI agent that was filed in support of the arrest warrant said Nxivm was based in upstate New York and operated like a multilevel marketing scheme, pushing members to take classes that cost as much as $5,000.It encouraged members to take more classes to move up the ranks and to recruit other members to help create more revenue, which left some members in debt to Nxivm itself, the affidavit said.The members in Nxivm called themselves ""Nxians,"" and wore different colored sashes that signified their ranks, the affidavit said. They signed nondisclosure agreements and promised not to reveal certain things about Nxivm's teachings, the affidavit said.Within the group was a secret society called DOS that prosecutors say consisted of dozens of women who were ""masters"" or ""slaves."" The affidavit said DOS masters went after recruits who were ""experiencing difficulties"" in their lives.While recruiting them, the masters would insist the recruits provide information about themselves as ""collateral,"" to encourage the recruits to keep information about DOS a secret, the affidavit said.The collateral included sexually explicit photos, videos in which the member tells damaging stories about themselves and letters making damaging statements against friends or family, the affidavit said.DOS had a pyramid structure, with Raniere at the top as the highest master and the only male, the affidavit said.Women who served as ""slaves"" were expected to complete tasks for their masters, and could be punished if they failed, the affidavit said. The affidavit said some slaves were expected to have sex with Raniere and stick to extremely low-calorie diets to stay thin -- because Rainere liked thin women.In one of the most bizarre allegations, some DOS members were branded with a cauterizing pen on their pubic regions in ceremonies that were recorded and could take half an hour, the affidavit said.""Some DOS victims were told that the brand stood for the four elements (the lines represented air, earth, and water and the cauterizing pen represented sealing with fire),"" the affidavit said. ""Based on information obtained during the course of the investigation, however, it is clear that the brand in fact consisted of Rainere's initials.""The man at the topRaniere's mission was teaching others about how to achieve true happiness, said his lawyer, Agnifilo.""Part of what I feel I have to prove is that Keith Raniere is not a monster,"" Agnifilo said. ""He's a well-intentioned person who spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how to help people be happier.""Raniere denies Nxivm is a cult, Agnifilo said.""He's nervous that the case has created a lot of what he views as sort of prejudice against him and his ideas,"" Angifilo said. ""He firmly believes his ideas are sound ideas, are good ideas, are humanitarian ideas.""He thinks DOS is a good idea and is a pro-woman group. He created it to have women have their own society ... where men would play no role.""Before starting Nxivm, Raniere had founded a company called Executive Success Programs which was supposed to ""actualize human potential,"" said the affidavit.Is Nxivm really a cult?Prosecutors don't go as far as to call the group a cult in court filings.But cult expert and former cult member Janja Lalich -- who was not a member of Nxivm and is not a witness in the trial -- says it ""absolutely"" is a cult, which she defines as a group or social movement with a shared devotion to a charismatic, authoritarian leader that's structured in such a way that it asserts influence and control over its members to keep them under their control. She believes this is the biggest trial of a purported cult leader in nearly a decade.""The Nxivm courses were used as a way to draw people into the more restricted and more perverse inner circles, including DOS,"" Lalich said. ""In a sense, Nxivm is a front to draw people in to be able to target certain people and pull them in further and further.""Lalich said that most people who become involved with cults were recruited as members by family or friends. And once inside, it became difficult to leave.Actress Catherine Oxenberg, a former star on the TV show ""Dynasty,"" also thinks Nxivm is a cult. Oxenberg was able to get her daughter, India, out of the group. She had no comment on if India was asked to testify in the trial.Mother and daughter started taking Nxivm classes in 2011, thinking they would learn about entrepreneurship, Catherine Oxenberg said in an email to CNN. India became more engrossed in the classes and moved from Los Angeles to Nxivm's upstate New York headquarters, her mother said.""One of the most deeply evil tricks of cults, Nxivm/DOS in particular, is that they hide behind the veneer of choice, even choices many rightly say are virtuous,"" Catherine Oxenberg said. ""But in cults such 'choices' only serve the perverted goals of the leader.""Testifying could be 'empowering but devastating'Bronfman, Mack, Russell, Lauren Salzman and Nancy Salzman were accused of serious crimes of their own, including prosecutors' allegation that they ""were aware of and facilitated Raniere's sexual relationship with two underage victims,"" including a 15-year-old girl. Dozens of child pornography images are part of the evidence.Mack, 36, pleaded guilty in April to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges and faces up to 40 years in prison. She was a DOS master and helped co-found DOS, which was targeted toward actors, prosecutors said.Bronfman, who served on Nxivm's executive board for nearly a decade, used her wealth to help finance Nxivm's activities, prosecutors said. She tearfully pleaded guilty in April to concealing and harboring undocumented immigrants for financial gain and fraudulent use of identification. She faces up to 27 months in prison and agreed to pay $6 million in forfeiture to the government.Lalich said she has spoken with about a dozen former Nxivm members, and believes it will be difficult for Raniere's former followers to face him in court, especially those who have recently pleaded guilty.""It'll feel empowering but it'll also be devastating,"" Lalich said. ""I'm hoping that the attorneys have a good support system set up for all of those women.""Agnifilo told CNN he believes that if any of the women who have pleaded guilty testify against Raniere, it would only help his case, and that Raniere has repeatedly told his attorney that he hopes his co-defendants don't have to serve prison time.""I think they're going to be important witnesses for both sides,"" Agnifilo said. ""I think they're going to give an accurate, balanced perspective.""",https://www.wpbf.com/article/sex-cult-leader-on-trial-says-he-just-wanted-to-create-a-secret-society-of-women/27407763,2019-05-08T17:11:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
280,Cape Coral approves Rotary plan to install 200 school bus stop benches,"CLOSE Follow these tips to stay safe at the school bus stop. Dan DeLuca, Wochit

Cape Coral City Council approved a community project to install 200 benches at school bus stops across the city Monday night.

The Rotary Club of Cape Coral agreed to donate the benches at no cost to the city, in hopes that students will use them instead of sitting on the road while waiting for their school buses.

The project comes on the heels of the death of 8-year-old Layla Aiken, who was killed by a hit-and-run driver in March while sitting on the edge of the roadway waiting for her bus in north Cape Coral. The resolution passed unanimously, with District 6 Council Member Rick Williams absent.

The benches, made of recycled plastic, will be attached to a concrete base, and will be transportable, if the bus stops move. The city and school district will determine the locations for the benches.

Cape Coral traffic engineer Bill Corbett previously said there have been 16,000 school bus stop changes across the county during the current school year, for various reasons, including the presence of registered sex offenders and students moving.

City Manager John Szerlag said the benches will be in place before the next school year begins in August.

Elmer Tabor, longtime Cape Realtor and Rotarian, said the project was a community effort.

“When this tragedy happened, we immediately texted the (police) chief and said Rotary wants to be part of the solution,” Tabor said, referring to Layla’s death. He added that the Kiwanis Club also got involved in the project.

“I can’t tell you how many people in the community stepped up to the plate, physically or financially,” he said.

Police Chief David Newlan said there have been 11 incidents over the last 10 years involving students walking to and from school or their bus stop, ranging from drivers clipping students with their car mirrors to death. He said there are more than 1,600 bus stops in the Cape.

The benches cannot display advertising or logos, but they can feature a plaque acknowledging a donation from a family or individual, according to the terms of the pilot project.

“Bus stop benches is a great start,” Mayor Joe Coviello said. “I hope we can build upon that.”

District 5 Council Member David Stokes said this may be his favorite resolution of the year, adding that he's sad for the reason it came about, but glad to see the community taking action.

Szerlag organized a stakeholders' group on the topic of bus stop safety that includes Cape Coral city staff, Rotary members, and staff from Lee County and the Lee County School District.

The group, which brought forward the bench pilot program, will have a more holistic meeting on student safety traveling to and from school later this month, he said. Topics brought up at a recent town hall on bus stop safety included school choice, school start times, lighting and sidewalks.

""We are grateful to the City of Cape Coral and the Rotary Club of Cape Coral for spearheading this project, and wholeheartedly support this endeavor,"" Lee Schools Superintendent Greg Adkins said in a letter to the city. ""Keeping our students safe is of highest priority and the responsibility of everyone in our community.""

The Lee County School District transports 49,000 students every school day, and has 753 bus routes.

282,"Former Ormond Beach officer tried to hide drugs in pants after crash, deputies say","PALM COAST, Fla. - A Florida man who identified himself as a former police officer after being involved in a crash is facing charges of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies said they were called to the intersection of U.S. 1 South and Seminole Woods Boulevard in Palm Coast Sunday afternoon after a crash with injuries was reported.

When deputies arrived, they found Brenton Hodge, 55, in the driver's seat of a blue Nissan Altima, which had damage to its rear end, according to a report from the Sheriff's Office. A silver Mercedes was found nearby with damage to its front end, the report said.

A deputy at the scene approached Hodge and found him messing with a cooler in the floorboard of the car, according to the report. The deputy said Hodge smelled of alcohol and was slurring his words.

When the deputy asked Hodge what was in the cooler, Hodge replied, ""Nothing,"" according to body camera video from the crash scene.

“Where were you drinking at? “This car reeks of booze, man,” the deputy said.

When the deputy asked why, Hodge said it was because he was taking his trash out earlier and it had a lot of beer cans in it that leaked onto his seat, the video showed.

When the deputy continued asking about the crash and why Hodge's vehicle smelled like alcohol, Hodge told the deputy he was drinking earlier in the day but was just sitting at the intersection with his blinker, waiting to make a U-turn, when the driver of the Mercedes hit the back of his vehicle.

A witness at the scene said it appeared that Hodge had his left blinker on and was trying to make a U-turn but was in the middle or right turning lane.

A short time later, Hodge identified himself as a retired Ormond Beach police officer, deputies said.

“I know where you’re going. I’m a retired cop.” Hodge told the deputy as he flashed what the Sheriff's Office said was a badge.

When getting out of the Altima, Hodge grabbed a bag of what deputies believed was marijuana and tried to shove it down his pants in front of them, the report said.

“Trying to shove weed down your pants? Are you kidding me?” the deputy said.

Multiple beer cans, including some that had been opened, were found in his vehicle, deputies said.

Hodge, whose airbags were deployed, then told deputies he wanted to go to the hospital, after initially telling one deputy he did not need medical attention, the video showed.

He was taken to Advent Health to be treated for his injuries before being booked into jail on charges of marijuana possession over 20 grams and driving under the influence, deputies said.

The driver of the other vehicle was also taken to the hospital to be treated for injuries, deputies said.

Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly said regardless of Hodge's being a retired officer, he would still be held accountable for his actions.

""As a former law enforcement officer, he should be well aware of the dangers of drinking and driving. It is disappointing that he thought he could manipulate the situation by showing our deputies his retired badge and trying to [stuff] his drugs down his pants,"" Staly said. ""None of his tactics worked. If you drink and drive in Flagler County, you will go to jail. No exceptions, no excuses.""

284,Watch: Alligator living at Gatorland bellows during mating season,"- It’s mating season for gators in Florida, and the bellowing sounds of the reptiles can be heard in the wild – and in Gatorland.

Janneke Case is a photographer who was allowed into the Orlando theme park early Saturday morning before it opened to the public. One alligator in particular didn’t seem to notice the humans, as it bellowed to get the attention of a female partner.

“How to attract a girl…gator style!” wrote Case in a Facebook post.

She said she intended to capture photos of the birds inside Gatorland. The park allowed photographers to enter between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. The park opens to the public at 10 a.m.

“The gators start early after sunrise,” she told FOX 13, “and I was lucky enough to be there early.”

Gatorland calls itself the “Alligator Capital of the World.” It has been around since 1949 and efforts in educating the public about the Florida alligator.

287,"Man arrested in crash that killed 9-year-old girl, injured 12-year-old brother","- Altamonte Springs police say a drunk Ulises Mora smashed his Porsche into a black Acura.

The wreck tore a black sedan in half, throwing two children out of the car: A 9-year-old girl, who died instantly, and her 12-year-old brother, who paramedics rushed to the hospital.

Paul Sienko lives near where it happened.

“I was beside myself because I ran out there right after it happened. It was really tragic,” he said.

Sienko said it was the worst accident he's seen at that intersection.

“You see such close calls,"" he said. ""We've had about six bad accidents out there that I remember.”

Police said after the crash, Mora stayed on scene and went to the hospital where doctors took a blood sample. They didn't arrest him for causing the crash, because they wanted to wait on his blood alcohol test. Now, the results are in and officials say he was driving over the legal limit.

“He had alcohol in his system. That's when we were able to partner with the state attorney's office to determine that we could charge him,” said Evelyn Estevez, with the Altamonte Springs Police Department.

Police charged Mora with DUI manslaughter and booked him into the Seminole County jail. They said the victims' family is relieved.

“This is a devastating thing for the family. We met them last night and gave them the news he'd been arrested and they were grateful. Whatever closure looks like for them, we were hoping to give them a little bit of closure in the incident,” Estevez said, adding that police were still investigating the crash.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/man-arrested-in-crash-that-killed-9-year-old-girl-injured-12-year-old-brother,2019-05-03T18:42:40Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

A Georgia man has been sentenced to time served for keeping a teenage girl in sexual captivity for more than a year.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports 33-year-old Michael Wysolovski was sentenced to 10 years, with eight months of jail time, after pleading guilty Thursday to first-degree cruelty to children and interstate interference with custody.Wysolovski will receive credit for eight months spent in detention before his trial, meaning his prison time has already been served and probation will account for the remaining nine years and four months of the sentence. He must also register as a sex offender for life.He was arrested in 2017 after law enforcement found a 17-year-old North Carolina girl who’d been missing for over a year in his home in Duluth, a suburb north of Atlanta.The two met in an online forum for anorexia when the girl, who is not being named because she is a sexual assault victim, was 15 and said she was unhappy at home. Wysolovski later convinced the girl to come live with him, picking her up when she was 16 on the side of an interstate near her Charlotte-area home.Georgia’s age of consent is 16, so Wysolovski could not be charged with child molestation.Prosecutor Michael DeTardo said the victim and Wysolovski initially agreed to enter into a sexual relationship in which they simulated non-consensual sex acts. But over time, Wysolovski violated the agreement, using “excessive force” and refusing to recognize “safe words.” DeTardo said Wysolovski also used food to punish the victim, who was anorexic, or forced her to perform sex acts.The newspaper reports that DeTardo said the relationship was a “gray area” of consent that would be risky to bring before a jury. Rape and aggravated sodomy charges were dropped in the plea deal, and the victim’s family and DeTardo prioritized a requirement for Wysolovski to register as a sex offender.Wysolovski told the court he believed he was helping the victim escape a bad home life.Police located the girl after she contacted another person on an anorexia forum who contacted the FBI.During a victim impact statement Thursday, the girl’s father said she was found malnourished, with ringworm and suffering from back problems because she had been repeatedly held in a dog cage.Holding a stuffed animal and speaking in a soft voice, the victim told the court: “The psychological damage Michael Wysolovski inflicted is beyond imagination.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/no-prison-time-for-man-who-kept-teenage-girl-in-sexual-captivity-for-a-year/27355124,2019-05-03T14:50:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

293,Florida teacher to press charges against 9-year-old who allegedly punched her,"(Photo by Ian Waldie/Getty Images)

(Photo by Ian Waldie/Getty Images)

VOLUSIA COUNTY, Fla. (WESH)— A Florida elementary school teacher wants to press charges against one of her students.

She claims that the 9-year-old girl hit her, and the incident happened in the classroom.

That teacher has now filed a report with the sheriff's department.

The alleged victim teaches third grade at Woodward Avenue Elementary School in DeLand. She said the student hit her when the teacher told her to pick up a book that the student allegedly threw.

""There are no other professions that exist where it would be okay or acceptable to be hit by anyone,"" said Volusia United Educators president Elizabeth Albert.

Albert said she was disappointed, but not surprised that a student allegedly hit a teacher. She said it's not the norm, but it's not rare, either, and according to the sheriff's report, ""this was not the first time that she (the student) had become physical with the staff.""

Albert said more and more often, teachers trained to deliver academic content are being asked to deal with social and emotional needs.

""What we really need more of are the licensed, mental health specialists, professionals who can help the children and give them the support they really need,"" Albert said.

Officials said the teacher, in her first year with Volusia County schools, asked the student to pick up a text book the 9-year-old threw on the classroom floor. According to the report, the student, ""refused and punched her (the teacher) in the right hand.""

The teacher didn't need medical attention, but feels so strongly she's pressing charges.

""We should have folks looking at our kids who are in crisis and determining what interventions are going to make them successful,"" Albert said.

In a statement, a district spokesman wrote, ""We are aware of the allegations. School administration is looking into the situation.""

The school district won't comment on what, if any, discipline the student faces based on the allegation. The union president said per the contract, a student who acts out against a teacher is at the very least suspended.

According to the teacher's union, there have been several instances this year alone in which teachers or staff members had to go to the hospital or urgent care for an injury allegedly made by a student, but that was not the case with this incident. The teacher did not need medical attention.",http://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-teacher-presses-charges-against-9-year-old-who-allegedly-punched-her/1941469856,2019-04-20T21:34:59Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

Jonathan Moist was arrested on a felony charge of video voyeurism of someone at least 19 years old.

According to the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, Moists' niece and her friend who were housesitting for Moist discovered the hidden camera in November.

""He had a hidden camera in his bathroom that videoed an adult female in the shower,"" said Brevard County sheriff's spokesman Tod Goodyear, who added that the victim is the friend of Moists' niece.

The niece and victim removed the device and took it to the girl's mother, who lives in Cocoa, according to the Sheriff's Office. A sheriff's report says they removed an SD card from the device, plugged it into a computer and observed several videos of people in Moists's bathroom, including some in the shower.

Officials said Moist provided conflicting information about when he placed the device in his bathroom and the purpose of putting it there. Authorities also said other videos were captured, viewed and deleted by Moist.

Moist was arrested and taken to the Brevard County Jail. He was released after posting bond.

303,Young kids find pornographic images on free video game platform,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - News4Jax has uncovered a shocking element to Roblox, one of the most popular video game platforms for kids on the internet. The free online platform that allows users to create their own games reaches over 90 million users around the world. However, some parents are on high alert after their kids found pornographic content while playing.

It's not a new problem, but it's still happening. In fact, we have reports of pornographic and inappropriate content that goes back to 2017, with the most recent happening this past month. It didn’t take long for other parents to come forward.

“Unfortunately I walked into the room looked at the screen and it looked like someone hacked into the game, and posted a pornographic image of a woman on one side of the building,” explained George Tudor, a St. Johns County father with three girls.

Tudor says he was horrified when at the age of 6, one of his daughters showed him a very graphic image.

""My first reaction was absolutely shock, how could this happen to my little girl? Then it quickly turned into anger,” said Tudor.

Tudor reported it to Roblox immediately and says the company got back to him quickly. However, he says he couldn’t take back what his daughter saw.

“More than anything, as frustrating as it was, I felt bad having her innocence taken away like that,” he explained.

News4Jax learned this was not an isolated incident. More pornographic images were sent to us by a parent who wished to remain anonymous.

The easiest way to understand Roblox is to think about it as a YouTube for video games. A gamer makes an account through the Roblox website or app.

Yulia Willmore, owner of Code Ninja, in St. Johns, uses the Roblox platform to teach kids coding and how to create online games.

""They can publish a game, they can code it, they can design it, and then they can upload it and it’s available,” Willmore explained.

But she admits, like any open platform, inappropriate users can find their way in. That's why she says parents need to pull up a chair to observe and learn what their kids are doing, ask questions about the games they are playing, and check in on chat rooms -- even ask to see the chats. (In privacy settings, chats can be turned off.)

With issues being reported for years, we reached out to Roblox to find out how inappropriate material continues to make its way onto the platform where potentially millions of children are exposed.

""Even if it's reported, I feel like the damage is already done if a child has seen it. So what is being done, and what do you recommend parents to do to make sure we don't get to that point?"" we asked Roblox VP of Marketing Tami Bhaumik.

“We do everything in our power to filter out everything, and moderation of all of the content. If there is an incident like that we work with parents to make sure we are responding as quickly as possible,” she answered.

Changes have been made over the last two years, Roblox says it has hired more than 800 people to moderate the site and has implemented several different privacy features.

READ: Roblox Parent's Guide

Kids have free access to Roblox by either downloading the app or going through its website, but must create an account before using it. The gaming platform says parents need to adjust those privacy settings when the account is made, to ensure added protections are in place before their child begins.

If you see inappropriate content, report it to Roblox immediately. It has a pretty good response time -- within 20 minutes.

But, Tudor believes safety starts with having real conversations with your children.

“For something like that, you’re not going to be in trouble at all, because we want to know things like that, because our number one goal as parents is to protect our kids,” Tudor suggested.

Below is what Roblox sent News4Jax in response to efforts to protect kids

Moderators

""Our moderators and support teams are global and include an internal team at our headquarters in California and numerous teams around the world to ensure round the clock 24x7 coverage and multilingual capability.

""We monitor and moderate the behavior of our player community and review every uploaded image, video, and audio file used within our games to make sure they are safe and age appropriate.

""Users exhibiting bad behavior have their Roblox accounts moderated, which can include suspensions and deletion of their accounts on Roblox.""

Technology

""We use automated machine learning technology to review all communication between users, looking for inappropriate behavior.

""We also use automation to flag other content for further review by our moderators.

""We have significant restrictions for what users 12 and under can share, including the use of words or phrases that we feel could be potentially dangerous (e.g., sharing any numbers that could be part of a phone number or address).""

Community

""Parental control features allow for the selection of messaging options: (no chat, chat with friends, chat with everyone)

""Players can report inappropriate behavior using our Report Abuse system, which is located prominently throughout the site and in-game.

""In addition, users can easily mute or block any other player that they come across in game.

""Safety is our number one priority, but we don’t stop there. Roblox is committed to empowering kids, teens, parents, and caregivers with the skills to create positive online experiences.""

Roblox's new Digital Civility Initiative is investing in three main areas:

1. Enhancing the in-game experience for players; such as collaborating with leaders in the industry to develop algorithms to help identify and weed out bad actors.

2. Equipping parents, caregivers and educators with actionable resources to promote learning community safety and digital civility.

""This summer, we will launch a new site for digital well-being including safety tips, expert advice from online safety, parenting and education experts, and conversation starters to help parents navigate difficult topics about the digital world. To that end, we have also published a parent’s guide that we continually update with new resources and information as it becomes available.""

3. Partnering with digital safety leaders to strengthen the platform and make a positive impact on the industry.

""We have established partnerships with leading organizations nationwide that focus on child safety and internet safety including Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), Connect Safely, Fair Play Alliance, and kidSAFE among others. Our Trust & Safety Advisory Board is comprised of world-renowned digital safety authorities who help the company strengthen the platform and make a positive impact on the industry.""

304,KPD officer written up after placing students in handcuffs,"0 KPD officer written up after placing students in handcuffs

KISSIMMEE, Fla. - A Kissimmee police officer was written up after department leaders learned he put a trio of middle school-aged girls into handcuffs during a lunch detention to show them what being arrested would feel like.

Officer Antonio Johnson is not a school resource officer. He happened to be at Mater Palms K-8 Charter School when the girls involved were serving a lunch detention.

Nine students were in detention at the time on suspicion of trying to break into a locked classroom. A teacher at the school, who happens to be the mother of one of the girls involved, first complained to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement about what she said happened.

That teacher complained of ""alleged misconduct by Kissimmee Police Officers terrifying students by handcuffing them and telling them that they would be arrested for no reason,"" referring to the officer's actions as an ""abuse of power.""

The girls were not being criminally investigated in connection to the incident at school, and the school principal did not ask Johnson to speak with the girls or discipline them.

According to a just-completed internal affairs investigation, one girl involved told KPD IA investigators that Johnson ""instructed her to stand up, to put her hands behind her back and he placed her in handcuffs. The officer instructed her to sit down and the officer left the room for a few moments.""

IA investigators determined Johnson used his handcuffs on three students during the incident. When questioned, Johnson said the use of handcuffs was ""his idea alone, no one assisted him with the handcuffing"" and that the SRO at the school was only present when he handcuffed one student.

When the principal of the school was questioned, internal affairs officers noted she ""defiantly"" denied knowledge of the handcuffing.

KPD Chief Jeff O’Dell provided this statement to 9 Investigates:

“Our Police Department prides itself on its continual efforts to positively interact with the community. We have several youth programs which enrich and inform some of our youngest residents. Officer Johnson is part of those enrichment programs through the Problem Oriented Policing Unit which is focused on crime prevention education to the community. We encourage our officers to educate young people on the laws and possible consequences of their actions. However, Officer Johnson’s actions on January 25, are not a reflection of his training, previous work, or encouraged by anyone at our Police Department. Although his intentions were to educate students on the seriousness of their actions (attempting to break into a locked classroom) we found his actions were inappropriate and reflected poorly on the agency. Upon receipt of the complaint, we immediately began investigating and found his actions did not meet up to Department standards. Moving forward we would encourage any parents with concerns about our officers to come forward as we work to continually build on our positive relations with the community.”

305,It’s a boy! Birth photo showing mother’s surprised reaction goes viral,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — A photo showing a North Carolina mother’s surprised reaction to her newborn son has gone viral.

Winston-Salem photographer Lauren Jolly captured the moment last December while working with Nancy and Will Ray.

Jolly said the couple had waited to learn the sex of their first two babies at birth, but opted to find out early during the third pregnancy, and they were told it was a girl.

When the big moment finally arrived, Jolly said she rushed to the birth center just in time to photograph the baby’s speedy arrival.

“She delivered her baby in the tub and then carried ‘her’ over to the bed,” Jolly recalled. “About 10 minutes later, they prepared to cut baby’s cord and Nancy exclaimed, ‘What is THAT? Is this a boy baby?!'”

Jolly said Will looked closer to confirm, and fell to his knees.

“We were all in shock and couldn’t stop laughing,” Jolly said. “I’m so glad I was there to capture this moment – that’s the magic of birth photography!”

Nancy posted the image to her Instagram page where it currently has more than 6,000 likes.

“I will forever advocate for birth photography because this is one of my very favorite photos of all time. Thank you @laurenjollyphoto,” she wrote.

Jolly told WGHP that she knew it was a great story, but she never expected it to take off the way it has.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/05/06/its-a-boy-birth-photo-showing-mothers-surprised-reaction-goes-viral/,2019-05-06T13:58:09Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394
306,Sarasota family sues JUUL and tobacco giants,"Lawsuit against e-cigarette maker and Altria claims they intentionally target teens

SARASOTA COUNTY — A Sarasota County girl and her parents are suing an e-cigarette maker and two tobacco giants for allegedly breaking federal laws by intentionally targeting teenagers while falsely denying doing so.

The class action lawsuit, brought by Sarasota County residents Erin and Jared NesSmith and their daughter, identified in court documents only as A.N., accuses e-cigarette company JUUL Labs Inc. and tobacco company Altria Group Inc., which owns Philip Morris USA Inc., the maker of Marlboro, of violating federal racketeering laws by purposely exploiting adolescents and getting them hooked on the aerosol devices that deliver a more powerful hit of nicotine than cigarettes, while denying the calculated marketing moves, according to court documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida on April 15.

Philip Morris recently acquired a 35 percent ownership interest in JUUL.

The family is seeking damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and for fraud, product liability and deceptive trade practices for themselves and potentially thousands of other unnamed plaintiffs in the suit.

“JUUL knew that JUUL e-cigarettes were not safe for nonsmokers, and posed a risk of aggravating addiction in those already addicted to cigarettes,” the suit states.

The family could not be reached for comment.

A JUUL representative denied in an email to the Herald-Tribune that the company targets teens.

“Our product is intended to be a viable alternative for current adult smokers only. We do not want nonnicotine users, especially youth, to ever try our product,” JUUL representative Ted Kwong said. “To this end, we have launched an aggressive action plan to combat underage use as it is antithetical to our mission. To the extent these cases allege otherwise, they are without merit and we will defend our mission throughout this process.""

In the suit, the girl, 15, claims she is addicted to JUUL and now suffers from seizures — a complication of nicotine ingestion, according to the lawsuit. The teen began using the electronic cigarettes, which look like an USB drive and comes in fruity flavors such as mango, when she was 14. She was unaware the device contained nicotine when she began “JUULing,” and inadvertently on occasion swallowed the e-liquid nicotine in the JUUL device, according to court documents.

“Mimicking Big Tobacco’s past marketing practices, defendants prey on youth to recruit replacement smokers for financial gain,” the suit states.

Her parents and their lawyers say she has fallen victim to the e-cigarette epidemic affecting youth.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, e-cigarette use from 2011 to 2014 among high school students soared from 1.5 percent to 13.4 percent, and among middle school students from 0.6 percent to 3.9 percent. Spending on e-cigarette advertising — which often includes bright colors attractive to teens and depicts smoking e-cigarettes as cool and hip — rose from $6.4 million in 2011 to an estimated $115 million in 2014.

The suit also cites additional CDC data that found 4.9 million middle and high school students were current users of a tobacco product in 2018, meaning they used such products in the past 30 days. That figure represents an increase of 1.3 million users since 2017.

Sarasota County schools this year began tracking youth use of e-cigarettes, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has characterized as an epidemic. Local school officials in January found 224 documented incidents of e-cigarette use in schools. That number has since increased to 327, district spokeswoman Tracey Beeker said in an email. There are 43,000 students in the district.

JUUL's plan for deterring youth use, according to the company's website, includes deactivating Facebook and Instagram accounts for marketing, suspending the sale and distribution of nontobacco and nonmenthol JUUL pods to more than 90,000 retail stores and requiring online consumers to be at least 21 to purchase its products.

But the family's lawyer, Scott Schlesinger of the Fort Lauderdale-based Schlesinger Law Firm, claims JUUL’s aim is to hook people when they’re young and most susceptible to addiction.

“There’s an opportunity to get customers when they’re vulnerable in their youth, because that’s when the brain is vulnerable to this drug addiction,” Schlesinger said, adding the pending litigation could last for years. “That’s the dirty little secret of the nicotine delivery industry.”

The FDA has the power to cap nicotine levels in e-cigarettes, but hasn’t proposed any standard. For cigarettes, there’s no limit on nicotine, although the FDA has taken preliminary steps toward reducing levels to help smokers quit. JUUL, like all e-cigarettes in the country, has not been approved to help smokers quit. The FDA isn’t expected to begin reviewing the contents and health effects of e-cigarettes for at least two more years, according to a recent report by the Associated Press.

Juul has published little peer-reviewed research, and only in the last year have independent researchers begun studying its formula. The company says each of its full-strength pods delivers about as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. Researchers at Portland State University analyzed the concentration of Juul’s full-strength pod against nine other nicotine formulas on the market in 2017. Juul’s nicotine level dwarfed its competitors, in some cases by twentyfold, according to the AP report.

Meanwhile, Schlesinger is considering filing a federal petition asking the courts to prohibit retailers from selling the devices.

“An adolescent nicotine epidemic is a public health emergency that requires immediate action,” Schlesinger said.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190506/sarasota-family-sues-juul-and-tobacco-giants?rssfeed=true,2019-05-06T07:07:39Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236
307,"After suicide attempt, N. Fort Myers teen finds help, fairy tale ending","Lizandra studied the paper on her desk, but her mind was not on freshman math. She was thinking of ways to commit suicide. Maybe she could use scissors. A pencil. A knife.

Later she searched online for information on the anti-depressant she was taking; she has forgotten the name, there were so many. She read that suicidal thoughts could be a side effect and wondered, Why would they give me this?

At her next appointment at SalusCare, Lee County’s safety net mental health provider, she mentioned the thoughts. The provider switched her medication, she said, and gave her another that made her feel drugged up.

“I didn’t feel like myself,” said Lizandra, now 18. “They made me take so many different ones.”

Since middle school, the North Fort Myers teen had taken medication and received counseling a few times a month. Yet, she didn’t start healing until arriving at the PACE Center for Girls in Lee County, an academic and counseling program where she thrived.

“I actually have dreams and inspiration, and I never had that,” Lizandra said.

PACE requested her last name not be used because of the mental health information she provided.

For years, Lizandra was bullied in middle school. She blamed herself for her parents’ split. She struggled with a learning disability. A physician referred her to SalusCare, where she was put on medication.

“When I went to SalusCare, the vibe was so not good. I didn’t like it because I felt like I was a nutcase because all the people there. This one dude, he was trying to get close to me, and I was like, 'I feel very uncomfortable right now.' ”

She saw a counselor a few times a month but then stopped.

“It wasn’t really helping. Then she had to move,” she said. “They put me with this other person … and I was like, ‘No, I’m not talking to this person. I don’t feel comfortable.’ ”

Her depression deepened during her first year at Island Coast High School in Cape Coral. At one point, she asked to see a freshman counselor and was sent to find another counselor at lunch only to talk to that counselor a few minutes. She ended up calling her grandfather to pick her up from school.

That year, she began drinking, smoking and skipping school. At one point, she took Ibuprofen to try to kill herself.

“I went to sleep, and I woke up and was like, ‘Damn, I’m still here.’ ”

An Island Coast official suggested PACE; she began attending in 2017. Early on, Lizandra told a PACE counselor she wanted to ease off medication.

“We would never really advise someone to get off medication, but she felt like she was getting enough support that ultimately that was an OK choice for her,” said Kendra Pugh, Lee PACE’s social services coordinator.

Outside PACE, Lizandra felt the focus was on medicating rather than healing.

“They kept medicating her, but they could not get to anywhere close in the counseling to come to the core of the issues she was having to deal with and the trauma,” said Meg Geltner, Lee PACE’s executive director. “And that’s very typical. We see that a lot here.”

“All the time,” Pugh said.

“All the time,” Geltner repeated.

With limited mental health providers accepting insurance and Medicaid, access to quality and intensive outpatient treatment can be difficult.

“Access to care is the biggest gap that we have. That can be too long of wait lists at one agency, it can be lack of transportation,” Pugh said. “I’ve heard of families having to wait months for an appointment and then the car breaks down on the way to the appointment and then they’ve lost that appointment for another three to four months.”

“We’re not knocking any other agency. I think it’s just what the state of it is there’s a lot of people who need the services and there’s very few options for services.”

At PACE, girls are assigned an on-site counselor. If girls request to see their counselor, they’ll likely see that counselor the same day or they can talk to another counselor on staff, PACE officials said.

“We allocate the time needed to address the things that need to be addressed,” Pugh said. “It’s not rare to see a girl multiple times a week.”

Lizandra quickly warmed to PACE, where counseling helped get to the root of her depression. She took a long break from social media, cut toxic friendships from her life, and focused on herself.

Her attendance is more than 85 percent, she has A’s and B’s, and a part-time job at a dollar store. She’s thinking about a career as a pediatric oncology nurse.

“I felt like a wilted rose before,” Lizandra said.

Now she feels strong and beautiful; it’s a fairy tale ending.

“Do you know the rose in the 'Beauty and the Beast'? It’s like that.”",http://rssfeeds.naplesnews.com/~/601654340/0/naples/home~After-suicide-attempt-North-Fort-Myers-teen-finds-help-and-fairy-tale-ending/,2019-05-06T06:16:21Z,Naples Daily News,Couple,"1100 Immokalee Rd, Naples, FL 34110, USA",FL,34110

313,Opinion: Investing in mental health helps improve quality of life for children and families,"A Pace Center girl works at her desk. Pace Center for Girls harnesses the potential of each girl with a focus on their future. (Photo: Amy Ploss-Samson)

Good mental health is as fundamental as good physical health in helping children succeed and reach their full potential. Unmet mental health needs can impact the long-term economic mobility and quality of life of children and families. This can often result in dependency, costly institutionalization or recurrent involvement in the criminal justice system.

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are strongly correlated to a wide range of mental problems in children. ACEs include but are not limited to poverty, physical or sexual abuse, and neglect; violence in the home, at school, or in the community; and family hardships such as parental incarceration. Research has found that exposure to multiple ACEs increases the chances for involvement in child welfare, juvenile justice, and behavioral health systems.

Opinion: Treatment before tragedy should be our mental health mantra

And: Stop the stigma and help save lives. #StandUp for mental health awareness.

Florida’s KIDS COUNT report provides data on the intersection of mental health and juvenile justice in Florida, two systems that serve children and youth who have experienced high levels of trauma. According to Florida’s Department of Juvenile Justice, 32.9 percent of all youth in custody have a history of mental health problems.

For girls, these numbers are disproportionately higher with 48.8 percent of girls in custody having a history of mental health issues. Baker Acts in Florida (involuntary mental health examinations) have increased more than 49 percent over the past eight years. As these systems often overlap, we must ensure that the services available and responsive to the needs of young people and their families.

In 2018, nearly 3,000 girls between the ages of 12 and 18 came to Pace Center for Girls seeking to live a healthy life, succeed in school, and remain out of the juvenile justice system. In every case, persistent trauma had a profound impact on their behavior and academics. One-quarter of girls came to Pace with prior involvement with the juvenile justice system and more than a third had been expelled from school.

Brook, a high school sophomore, was sexually assaulted by a student at her public school. She started skipping school to avoid her attacker, failed most of her classes and dropped out. Eventually, her trauma led to her own self-harm and thoughts of suicide.

For girls like Brook, adversity and danger are constant forces in their lives. Over time, a fight-or-flight reaction crowds out the ability to make reasonable decisions, form healthy relationships, and can lead to issues with one’s physical health, such as an increased risk of heart disease or other known effects of chronic stress.

It is vital for schools to be physically and emotionally safe environments and to provide comprehensive services to address the needs and challenges facing girls like Brook. At Pace Center for Girls, we create safe and gender-responsive environments while providing extensive counseling and trauma-informed services to girls and young women. By doing this, we harness the unique potential of each girl with a focus on their future.

After only 13 months at Pace, Brook completed two full years of high school and graduated at age 16. Today, she is enrolled in college for her veterinary technician certification.

315,"Ex-officer takes plea deal, heads back to prison","PALM COAST, Fla. - A former Bunnell police corporal who served time on child porn charges is headed back to prison after accepting a plea deal on new charges Thursday.

Michael Stavris II, 34, was released Feb. 11 and was arrested again 15 days later after violating his probation. He was also charged with felony child abuse, fraud through the use of personal identification and stalking.

Stavris accepted a plea deal on those charges Thursday and will serve five years for violation of probation and 10 more years on the new charges. He will receive credit for time served.

The plea also requires Stavris to complete five years of sex offender probation after his release from prison, which includes no internet, no social media, no volunteer work around children, and no contact with his victims.

He must also undergo polygraph examinations at his expense, mental health treatment, and other standard conditions associated with sexual offender probation.

“We consider this resolution a success and I’m glad to see that Stavris will go back to prison for a long time,” Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly said. “This defendant has been preying on juveniles and women since 2011 and didn’t learn his lesson even after spending nearly three years in prison the first time, so it’s time to go back where he can’t prey on children. This was a combined effort between the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office, the Florida Department of Probation, the 7th Circuit State Attorney’s Office, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.”

Stavris initially agreed to a plea deal in 2016 on two counts of computer pornography and child exploitation and one count of criminal use of personal identification information and was sentenced to three years in prison followed by five years of probation.

One of the conditions of his probation was that he not maintain any social media accounts, deputies said.

On Feb. 14, the Sheriff's Office got a tip that Stavris might have created a fake Facebook account using a girl's photographs and name, according to a charging affidavit. The caller said the creator of the phony Facebook page also contacted various men, engaging them in inappropriate conversation while posing as the juvenile, according to deputies.

The Sheriff's Office said it was also reported that some of the messages included comments about stickers affixed to the rear of the girl's vehicle, which were recently placed. For this reason, according to deputies, it was believed that the suspect was following the girl, placing her in danger.

Deputies went along on a probation check for Stavris on Feb. 26, the Sheriff's Office said. They found evidence on his cellphone that he'd been using Facebook and had uploaded photos to the account, which violated his probation, deputies said.

Stavris was arrested Feb. 26 on a charge of violation of probation.

According to the charging affidavit, detectives obtained a search warrant for Stavris’ cellphone and confirmed he had been maintaining and uploading photos to the fictitious Facebook account.

316,Ex-cop returns to prison after impersonating girl online again,"FLAGLER COUNTY, Fla. - A former Bunnell police officer who posed as a teenage girl online three days after being released from prison on similar charges will be returning to prison.

Michael Stavris was first arrested in 2014 after allegations that he used photos of a teenage girl on a fake social media account that he used to get sexually explicit photos of teenage boys, many of whom attended Flagler Palm Coast High School.

Deputies said Stavris was sentenced to prison in 2016 on charges of felony child abuse and fraud through use of personal identification. He was released from prison on Feb. 11 then on Feb. 14, a new complaint was brought forth against him.

A 17-year-old girl said Stavris was using her photos on a fake Facebook account and was messaging her friends in an attempt to gather personal information about her life. He would also send her friends explicit photos claiming they were the victim, but they were not.

Stavris accepted a plea in that case on Thursday. He'll serve five years in prison for the violation of probation charge and 10 years in prison on the new charges of felony child abuse, fraud through the use of personal identification and stalking.

“We consider this resolution a success and I’m glad to see that Stavris will go back to prison for a long time,” Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly said. “This defendant has been preying on juveniles and women since 2011 and didn’t learn his lesson even after spending nearly three years in prison the first time, so it’s time to go back where he can’t prey on children.”

After he is released from prison, Stavris will be required to complete five years of sex offender probation, which prohibits him from using the internet, social media, contacting the victim or volunteering around children.

Polygraph examinations and mental health treatment will also be required.

Stavris was a sergeant with the Bunnell Police Department before his first arrest.

317,Lawsuit claims Orange County Schools didn't stop teachers from sexually abusing student,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - A lawsuit claims that Orange County Public Schools failed to protect its students, which led to two teachers having sexual relationships with a girl at Ocoee High School.

The lawsuit, filed last month on behalf of the victim who was 17 at the time the abuse happened, alleges that teachers, students and activities on campus were not properly monitored, which led to the abuse.

Former Ocoee High School teachers Chad Michael Coy and Ryan Stewart Kirkpatrick are both currently serving prison sentences on charges relating to having sex with the girl in the fall of 2016.

The girl's father told News 6 at the time that the abuse happened on campus, including once during a lockdown drill.

Allegations against OCPS include allowing the girl to be unsupervised with the male teachers, failing to put procedures in place to prevent sexual abuse or inappropriate behavior, failing to keep students safe and failure to put measures in place to assess whether personnel posed a risk to students, among other things.

Attorneys claim the girl, who is now an adult, suffered emotional trauma, great humiliation, psychological disorders and needed to undergo medical treatment as a result of the abuse.

The lawsuit is seeking $15,000 in damages.

318,"Girl's mother wants school's 'predatory pedophile' to pay, attorney says","HOLLYWOOD, Fla. - A substitute teacher at Ben Gamla Preparatory High School, a charter school in Hollywood, sexually abused a 15-year-old student, according to a civil lawsuit filed in Broward County court.

The girl's mother filed lawsuits against the teacher identified as Roman Jose Fondon Jr., the school and Academica, the Florida company that owns the school, according to her attorney, John Leighton of Leighton Law in Miami's Brickell neighborhood.

""Fondon began to message her and engage in inappropriate contact with her,"" Leighton said in a statement. ""The behavior escalated to a point when he engaged in sexual contact with this girl, including tying her up and blindfolding her while he committed sex acts on her.""

Some of the alleged abuse happened inside Fondon's classroom at 3151 Taft St., the parking lot of the Hollywood YMCA, in the girl's bedroom and on the rooftop of the condominium where she lives, according to the lawsuit.

""Fondon exhibited elements of a predatory pedophile, as he routinely would flirt with students and talk about his personal life,"" Leighton wrote in the lawsuit.

Hollywood Police Department officers arrested Fondon, who was 27 years old when the alleged abuse happened last year, Sept. 19, 2018. He is facing three counts of sexual battery on a minor and three counts of lewd or lascivious battery on a minor.

Leighton said Fondon, who does not have a Florida teaching certificate, was not a trained teacher when he was hired to work as a substitute teacher.

This is a developing story. Local 10 News has yet to receive statements from Ben Gamla Preparatory High School and Academica.

319,Escambia County 19-year-old accused of raping girl in woods,"A 19-year-old from Escambia County allegedly invited a girl to go on a walk with him in the woods Monday and raped her once they were in a secluded area.

Dakota Stacey, 19, was arrested Monday and charged with sexual battery of a person between 12 and 18 by a person over the age of 18, as well as probation violation.

County records show he was booked into the Escambia County Jail at 8:52 p.m. Monday and given a bond of $200,000. However, because he was already on parole when he was arrested, his chance for bond was rescinded.

According to an arrest report, when an Escambia County Sheriff's Office deputy first met face-to-face with the girl, she was visibly upset and shaking. The girl told the deputy she and Stacey had been texting each other before deciding to meet up around 4 p.m. She said she greeted him with a hug, and Stacey allegedly kissed her.

The girl told the deputy that Stacey next asked if there was somewhere they could go to talk that was more private and referenced a spot in the woods that he knew the girl sometimes went to collect her thoughts, the report stated.

They entered the woods near the intersection of Woodbury Drive and Woodbury Circle, and while walking, she tripped over a branch, fell forward and landed on her knees, the report stated. Instead of helping her to her feet, she said, Stacey pushed her all the way down to ground and got on top of her.

The girl told the deputy, she twice tried to push Stacey off and told him ""no"" three or four times before he allegedly raped her.

The girl positively identified a photo of Stacey in the presence of investigators, the report stated.

Additionally, the girl was able to correctly find and point out Stacey’s residence using Google Maps to investigators.

Stacey was previously sentenced to 18 months of probation Dec. 19 for a charge of lewd or lascivious behavior.

His arrest report stated he and a 14-year-old female both admitted to skipping class to have sex in a cafeteria bathroom. Stacey was 18 at the time and the girl's parents pressed charges against him.

320,Texas man wanted in California child abduction arrested in Keys,"Deputies say Warren Demers, wanted in connection with a California child abduction, bought a sailboat in the Florida Keys and wanted to take his 8-year-old daughter to Cuba.

MARATHON, Fla. - A Texas man wanted in California for abducting his 8-year-old daughter was arrested Tuesday in the Florida Keys.

Warren Demers, 49, of New Caney, Texas, was arrested by Monroe County Sheriff's Office deputies during a traffic stop on U.S. Highway 1 in Marathon.

Sheriff's spokesman Adam Linhardt said Demers was wanted for kidnapping in San Bernardino County, California. Authorities there said Demers possibly possessed forged court documents stating he had rightful custody of the girl.

A be-on-the-lookout alert was issued for Demers, who was believed to be driving a Ford truck with a Texas license plate.

Linhardt said deputies received information Tuesday that Demers had purchased a boat in the Keys and was headed south. Deputies on the Seven Mile Bridge spotted a truck matching the description that was pulling a sailboat.

When deputies stopped the truck, they found Demers, the girl and a German shepherd inside.

""Demers and the girl had apparently been living out of the truck,"" Linhardt said. ""The truck was filthy and not suitable for living. It was learned that Demers planned on taking the girl to Cuba in the sailboat.""

The girl was turned over to the Florida Department of Children and Families, while the dog was placed in the care of the Florida Keys Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Demers was arrested and taken to jail. He is expected to be transferred to California to face charges.

322,Florida lawmakers back off effort to conceal foster parent names,"Move follows GateHouse Media report of allegations of child sex abuse against foster father.

Florida lawmakers backed off a proposal Tuesday that sought to conceal the names of foster parents through new public record exemptions.

The move came on the same day GateHouse Media reported allegations of child sex abuse against Gilberto Rios, who fostered 48 children with his wife since 2009.

On trial this week over charges that he sexually abused a 3-year-old girl in his care, Rios faced similar allegations from another foster girl two years earlier, GateHouse Media found — yet state officials continued to place children in his home.

Experts say the case illustrates why foster parents, who receive funding from the state of Florida, should not be exempt from public oversight. But that’s exactly what Florida legislators, backed by the Department of Children & Families, intended. A pair of bills making their way through the House and Senate would have protected the identities of foster parents, which are now public record under Florida statutes.

The bills came in response to a records request made by GateHouse and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune in July 2018 as part of an ongoing investigation into alleged misconduct of foster parents. The organizations asked for a list of all foster parents in the state. But even though DCF officials agreed that the names were not exempt under current public records law, they declined the request and then set about changing the law.

But on the heels of allegations against Rios, state lawmakers on the Florida House of Representatives Health and Human Services Committee amended the bill on Tuesday to instead conceal just the names of foster parents who operate human trafficking safe houses — refuges for children once engaged in the sex trade.

“These homes are notoriously difficult to keep open because traffickers find out where the children are,” said Robert Latham, a professor and associate director of the University of Miami Children & Youth Law Clinic. He estimates it removes maybe 10 or 20 names from the list of foster parents.

In a statement emailed to GateHouse Media, DCF Secretary Chad Poppell denied that his organization was trying to hide anything from public view.

“DCF is absolutely committed to transparency and accountability, and we have no tolerance for any abuse of any kind by any caregiver,” Poppell wrote. “The intent of HB 1249 is to provide protection to make foster parents and children in their care feel safe. However, we recognize there is a balance with transparency and accountability.”

Co-sponsors of the proposed legislation — Rep. Spencer Roach, R-North Fort Myers, and Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City — had argued the measure was necessary to protect foster parents against reprisal from biological parents.

But some child welfare advocates feared it would go too far — potentially putting vulnerable children further at risk.

The Children’s Campaign sent a call for action Tuesday to demonstrate opposition to earlier versions of the bill, citing the Herald-Tribune’s reporting as evidence.

“We felt like it removed transparency and accountability in the foster system,” said Roy Miller, president and founder of The Children’s Campaign. “The Rios trial just confirms all of our concerns.”

As of Tuesday, the Senate version of the bill remained unchanged.

“This bill and the associated amendment exemplify the risk many foster parents endure when caring for children who also happen to be victims of human trafficking,” Overdorf said before the Health and Human Services Committee. “Parents who care for these commercially, sexually exploited children are at an increased risk due to the relationship between human trafficking and various forms of associated violence.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190416/florida-lawmakers-back-off-effort-to-conceal-foster-parent-names?rssfeed=true,2019-04-17T10:08:00Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

324,JOHN JONCHUCK: Jurors deliberate on Florida man who threw daughter off bridge,"0 Jurors deliberate on Florida man who threw 5-year-old daughter off bridge

- A Florida man who threw his 5-year-old daughter off a Tampa Bay area bridge four years ago knew what he was doing was wrong and should be found guilty of first-degree murder, a prosecutor told jurors Monday during closing arguments of his trial.

But John Jonchuck's defense attorney told jurors that although her client dropped his daughter, Phoebe, 62 feet into Tampa Bay, he was insane and didn't know what he was doing.

""We know he had an overwhelming sense of fear,"" assistant public defender Jessica Manuele said. ""He felt that somebody was after him and Phoebe.""

PREVIOUS STORIES:

Jonchuck faces life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder by jurors, who started deliberating Monday afternoon, after listening to three weeks of testimony. The panel was released for the night shortly before 7 p.m. and scheduled to return Tuesday morning.

Paul Bolan, an assistant state attorney, told jurors Jonchuck was motivated by anger over worries that Phoebe's mother was going to take the girl away from him and his mother's doting attention to her granddaughter when she had been inattentive to him growing up.

Photos: Pictures of Phoebe Jonchuck

Jonchuck's act was premediated and his fleeing the scene is proof he knew what he was doing was wrong, Bolan said.

""It was rage that drove him to it on top of that bridge,"" Bolan said. ""Did he know what he was doing and did he know it was wrong? The answer is clearly, 'Yes.'""

However, Manuele told jurors Johnchuck loved Phoebe more than anything else in the world and there's no evidence he acted out of ""unbridled anger.""

Rather, Manuele said, his delusions led him to believe Phoebe was possessed, caused him to pour salt outside her window to keep spirits away and made him talk about the archangel Michael's coming.

""At that moment, he thought he was protecting his daughter,"" Manuele said. ""It will never make sense because it's insanity.""

Twelve hours before Phoebe's death, Jonchuck's divorce lawyer, Genevieve Torres, fearing for the girl's safety, called a state child protection hotline, according to authorities.

Torres told the Department of Children and Families operator that Jonchuck had driven to three churches in his pajamas with Phoebe in tow that morning, called Torres ""God"" and asked her to translate his stepmother's century-old Swedish Bible, which he carried and had become obsessed with. The attorney said Jonchuck also was paranoid that Phoebe wasn't his child.

But the hotline operator thought the attorney was more worried about Jonchuck's safety than the girl's and did not report the call to authorities.

Just after midnight the next day, Jonchuck's PT Cruiser raced past officer William Vickers, who was heading home from his shift in his patrol car. He started following Jonchuck, but never got close enough to read the license plate and didn't know Phoebe was inside, according to authorities.

As they reached the bridge's crest, Jonchuck stopped and got out. Vickers, fearing an ambush, stopped behind him, pulled his gun and yelled at Jonchuck to show his hands. He saw no weapon.

Jonchuck yelled at the officer, ""You have no free will."" He grabbed Phoebe from the back seat, held her over the side momentarily and then dropped her, according to police accounts.

Jonchuck drove off, but was soon arrested. Vickers scrambled down a ladder to a dock below the bridge but couldn't see Phoebe in the dark water. A marine rescue boat was summoned, and her body was found hours later.

327,Best of April: Top 5 things we tasted at Naples restaurants,"CLOSE The North Naples pizzeria launched in March 2019 in the Galleria Shoppes at Vanderbilt. Tim Aten, tim.aten@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4857

April showers gave us a valid excuse to stay indoors and enjoy more of the carb-loaded dishes Naples restaurants have to offer.

Last month, two new Mexican eateries — K-Rico Mexican Grill and Maria’s Tacos y Mas — launched in the Naples area just in time for Cinco de Mayo.

And sweets lovers rejoiced when Mitch’s Cookies Dessert Bar & Soda Fountain and Nothing Bundt Cakes hit the dining scene.

We may get cavities and become way too giddy when #TacoTuesday rolls around, but it's all part of the job.

Here's the best things we tasted last month (warning — don't continue reading on an empty stomach):

Butterscotch ice cream at Sub Zero

Even in April, you know summer's coming when you feel that damp heat in the afternoon, muggy and itchy and best dispelled by a cold scoop of ice cream. It's therapy to walk into a place like Sub Zero Nitrogen Ice Cream, one of a number of parlors that inevitably show up in my food expenditures over the summer.

The charm of Sub Zero is to be able to watch your concoction — butterscotch with a non-dairy almond milk base for me — being flash-frozen with huge puffs of nitrogen. It's swirled into an abundant scoopful ($6.68) that's solid but not concrete. Sub Zero is an accommodating franchise, with nondairy and no-sugar bases for those who want them and around 36 flavors to satisfy everyone in your group or instill gridlock.

Since it's frozen on the spot, there are plenty of choices that you might not have where the ice cream is already in the container. Because of its optimal frozen state, the staff can easily mix in goodies rather than just giving them a ride atop the ice cream.

I chose graham cracker crumbs to replicate a family butterscotch pie recipe and sat outside at one of the bistro sets to admire the presentation. It's stowed neatly inside a crisp wedge of waffle and presented in a dish.

It was a sweet, rich escape, creamy even with my nondairy base. (Dairyphile? The store has regular, premium, yogurt and custard bases, too.) And it was almost a total lunch with the generous scoop size.

This time I was able to resist the urge to go for an exotic flavor such as root beer or brownie batter, or to add another of 29 additional mix-ins, from nuts to bubble gum bits (75 cents).

Coffee Paolo pizza at Mister O1

Last month I found another pizzeria to obsess over: Mister O1 Extraordinary Pizza in Naples.

One of the best dishes is Mister O1's Coffee Paolo pizza crafted in its signature star shape. The crust is whisper thin. Mister O1 (that's Mister oh-one) uses flour imported from Italy that gives its dough an ethereal lightness and the most delicate chew. For the Coffee Paolo, simple tomato sauce and a smattering of mozzarella join the party, followed by crumbles of gorgonzola, slivers of Calabrese salami, a drizzle of honey and a dusting of ground coffee that looks like cocoa powder.

And have I even touched on this star-shaped thing? This simple dough-folding trick is Mister O1 at its most genius, a little thing founder Renato Viola knew would set his pizzas apart. The kitchen cuts slits at the edge of the crust, then folds it into eight points, filling each with a creamy dollop of ricotta. These points add another layer of texture, creating thicker bits of dough with a satisfying tug to them — deepening my obsession.

Avocado toast at The Hampton Social

This millennial girl loves her avocado toast. I've probably become a connoisseur at this point given all the times I've ordered the popular dish at restaurants. However, this avocado toast connoisseur was thrown off guard when the seemingly simple dish came to her table at The Hampton Social in North Naples.

More: What JLB ate: The Hampton Social in North Naples

It wasn't your typical avocado toast with only the mashed green fruit smeared on top of bread, although that's great too. This appeared almost like a Caprese sandwich with warmBurrata cheese and roasted tomato on top of a bed of creamy avocado mixed with olives. The sourdough toast underneath gave the dish a salty crunch.

I thought I knew everything there was to know about avocado toast. But turns out a true connoisseur is always learning.

Reuben from Toojay's Deli

Let's start from the top down on this one.

As soon as my fingers landed with a soft crunch on the buttery grilled rye bread of this colossal Reuben sandwich from Toojay's Deli, I almost had shivers down my spine. Melted Swiss cheese rested atop spiraled layers of sauerkraut and hot corned beef. A light layer of thousand island dressing graced the lower slice of grilled rye. The taste is straight forward — it's the deli classic you know and love, no bells or frills. And that's just how this kind of sandwich should be served.

And I haven't even started on the steak fries.

The fries are, again, simple — perfectly fried to a rich, gold color. Crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. Doesn't get much better than that.

BrickTop's at Waterside Shops in Naples near Artis—Naples offers the tastiest breaded pudding this side of the Gordon River. It's served with crème anglaise, caramel sauce and fresh whipped cream, and it's a hefty portion to share if desired.

328,Meghan Markle and 7 other American princesses who had a royal baby,"CLOSE With the birth of Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's royal baby, enjoy looking back at these historic royal births, from the 1940s to today. USA TODAY

Nearly a year after her wedding to Prince Harry, the Duchess Meghan of Sussex gave birth to her first child. Buckingham Palace said the boy arrived early this morning, weighing 7 pounds and 3 ounces.

A statement said the family, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Prince William and Duchess Kate and Harry's maternal aunts and uncle, have all been informed and ""are delighted with the news.""

The Duchess, better known as Meghan Markle, was born and raised in Los Angeles. Her newborn son is now seventh in line for the throne, right behind his father, Harry. The child is also the first ever mixed-race baby born into the royal family.

That said, the baby is not the first royal with an American mother.

Rita Hayworth

The actress was best known for her roles in films like ""Gilda"" and ""The Lady from Shanghai"" in the 1940s. But in 1949, Rita Hayworth left Hollywood behind to marry Prince Aly Khan, son of the leader of Nizārī Ismaili Muslims. She met him a year prior at the Cannes Film Festival.

They had both been married before, Khan once before and Hayworth twice, most recently to Orson Welles in a marriage that lasted from 1943 to 1947.

She gave birth to a daughter at the end of 1949, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan. Hayworth had previously given birth to another daughter fathered by Orson Welles. Her marriage to either child's father did not last.

Hayworth brought her daughter with her to Nevada to establish residency in order to qualify for a divorce, later saying there were threats against the child's life if the girl was not raised Muslim, according to a 1953 newspaper clipping. Hayworth said she wanted the child raised Christian.

The couple eventually divorced in 1953 but their daughter became her mother's caretaker as she suffered through Alzheimer's toward the end of her life.

Grace Kelly

Another Hollywood actress left behind a successful career in the 1950s after appearing in films like ""Rear Window"" and ""Dial M for Murder."" Grace Kelly also met her future husband at the Cannes Film Festival.

After a year-long courtship, Kelly married Rainer III, Prince of Monaco in 1956. The wedding was televised to an audience of an estimated 30 million viewers, according to the book ""Planet Wedding.""

As Princess of Monaco, she gave birth to three children: Princess Caroline in 1957, Prince Albert in 1958 and Princess Stéphanie in 1965. Albert is the current reigning monarch of Monaco, the second-smallest country in the world after the Vatican.

Kelly died in 1982 in a car crash after suffering a stroke while driving with Stéphanie in the car. Her daughter survived the crash.

Caroline Lee Radziwill

The sister of First Lady Jackie Kennedy, Radziwill divorced another American, Michael Temple Canfield before marrying Polish Prince Stanisław Albrecht ""Stash"" Radziwiłł in 1959. The prince also divorced his second wife in order to wed the American socialite.

Her title became ""Her Serene Highness Princess Caroline Radziwill,"" and she gave birth to a boy, Anthony, in 1959 and a daughter, Anna Christina, in 1960. Neither made a career out of being a royal.

Hope Cooke

Born in San Francisco, Hope Cooke traveled to India while a freshman at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959. There, she met Palden Thondup Namgyal, the Crown Prince of Sikhism. He had two children, was nearly twice her age, and a widower, but in 1963, the two wed.

The marriage required Cooke to renounce her U.S. citizenship. She became Queen of Sikhism, giving birth to two children, Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. She was also a step-mother to her husband's other three children.

But political conflict with the nation of India ultimately led to the kingdom coming to an end in the 1970s. Cooke then traveled back to the U.S. with her two children, according to The New York Times. She was granted permanent residency in the U.S and later, divorced Mamgyal.

Years after her grandfather immigrated to the U.S. from Syria, Halaby returned to the Middle East in the 1970s, meeting Hussein bin Talal, the King of Jordan. The two married in 1978, the King's fourth and final marriage.

Halaby took the royal name Noor Al-Hussein and converted to Islam. As Queen, she was step-mother to three of the King's children and gave birth to four more in the royal line:

Prince Hamzah in 1980, Prince Hashim in 1981, Princess Iman in 1983 and Princess Raiyah in 1986. Hamzah was Crown Prince of Jordan between 1999 to 2004 until his half-brother, King Abdullah II, removed him from the position. Abdullah has been King of the country since his father's death in 1999.

330,Sarasota County family suing e-cigarette maker and tobacco giants,"Lawsuit against JUUL and tobacco company Altria Group Inc. claims they intentionally target teens

SARASOTA COUNTY — A Sarasota County girl and her parents are suing an e-cigarette maker and two tobacco giants for allegedly breaking federal laws by intentionally targeting teenagers while falsely denying doing so.

The class action lawsuit, brought by Sarasota County residents Erin and Jared NesSmith and their daughter, identified in court documents only as A.N., accuses e-cigarette company JUUL Labs Inc. and tobacco company Altria Group Inc., which owns Philip Morris USA Inc., the maker of Marlboro, of violating federal racketeering laws by purposely exploiting adolescents and getting them hooked on the aerosol devices that deliver a more powerful hit of nicotine than cigarettes, while denying the calculated marketing moves, according to court documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida on April 15.

Philip Morris recently acquired a 35 percent ownership interest in JUUL.

The family is seeking damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and for fraud, product liability and deceptive trade practices for themselves and potentially thousands of other unnamed plaintiffs in the suit.

“JUUL knew that JUUL e-cigarettes were not safe for nonsmokers, and posed a risk of aggravating addiction in those already addicted to cigarettes,” the suit states.

The family could not be reached for comment.

A JUUL representative denied in an email to the Herald-Tribune that the company targets teens.

“Our product is intended to be a viable alternative for current adult smokers only. We do not want nonnicotine users, especially youth, to ever try our product,” JUUL representative Ted Kwong said. “To this end, we have launched an aggressive action plan to combat underage use as it is antithetical to our mission. To the extent these cases allege otherwise, they are without merit and we will defend our mission throughout this process.""

In the suit, the girl, 15, claims she is addicted to JUUL and now suffers from seizures — a complication of nicotine ingestion, according to the lawsuit. The teen began using the electronic cigarettes, which look like an USB drive and comes in fruity flavors such as mango, when she was 14. She was unaware the device contained nicotine when she began “JUULing,” and inadvertently on occasion swallowed the e-liquid nicotine in the JUUL device, according to court documents.

“Mimicking Big Tobacco’s past marketing practices, defendants prey on youth to recruit replacement smokers for financial gain,” the suit states.

Her parents and their lawyers say she has fallen victim to the e-cigarette epidemic affecting youth.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, e-cigarette use from 2011 to 2014 among high school students soared from 1.5 percent to 13.4 percent, and among middle school students from 0.6 percent to 3.9 percent. Spending on e-cigarette advertising — which often includes bright colors attractive to teens and depicts smoking e-cigarettes as cool and hip — rose from $6.4 million in 2011 to an estimated $115 million in 2014.

The suit also cites additional CDC data that found 4.9 million middle and high school students were current users of a tobacco product in 2018, meaning they used such products in the past 30 days. That figure represents an increase of 1.3 million users since 2017.

Sarasota County schools this year began tracking youth use of e-cigarettes, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has characterized as an epidemic. Local school officials in January found 224 documented incidents of e-cigarette use in schools. That number has since increased to 327, district spokeswoman Tracey Beeker said in an email. There are 43,000 students in the district.

JUUL's plan for deterring youth use, according to the company's website, includes deactivating Facebook and Instagram accounts for marketing, suspending the sale and distribution of nontobacco and nonmenthol JUUL pods to more than 90,000 retail stores and requiring online consumers to be at least 21 to purchase its products.

But the family's lawyer, Scott Schlesinger of the Fort Lauderdale-based Schlesinger Law Firm, claims JUUL’s aim is to hook people when they’re young and most susceptible to addiction.

“There’s an opportunity to get customers when they’re vulnerable in their youth, because that’s when the brain is vulnerable to this drug addiction,” Schlesinger said, adding the pending litigation could last for years. “That’s the dirty little secret of the nicotine delivery industry.”

The FDA has the power to cap nicotine levels in e-cigarettes, but hasn’t proposed any standard. For cigarettes, there’s no limit on nicotine, although the FDA has taken preliminary steps toward reducing levels to help smokers quit. JUUL, like all e-cigarettes in the country, has not been approved to help smokers quit. The FDA isn’t expected to begin reviewing the contents and health effects of e-cigarettes for at least two more years, according to a recent report by the Associated Press.

Juul has published little peer-reviewed research, and only in the last year have independent researchers begun studying its formula. The company says each of its full-strength pods delivers about as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. Researchers at Portland State University analyzed the concentration of Juul’s full-strength pod against nine other nicotine formulas on the market in 2017. Juul’s nicotine level dwarfed its competitors, in some cases by twentyfold, according to the AP report.

Meanwhile, Schlesinger is considering filing a federal petition asking the courts to prohibit retailers from selling the devices.

“An adolescent nicotine epidemic is a public health emergency that requires immediate action,” Schlesinger said.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190506/sarasota-county-family-suing-e-cigarette-maker-and-tobacco-giants?rssfeed=true,2019-05-06T00:21:00Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236
331,Putting the honor in Honor Flight: Veterans greeted and feted to D.C. and back,"As a hospice patient with lung cancer and a grim prognosis from doctors, Philip Keenly wasn’t an ideal candidate to make the Collier-Lee Honor Flight trip to Washington, D.C., on Saturday.

The group’s volunteer medical staff debated whether to allow him on the trip or assign him to the less taxing Honor at Home ceremonies planned on the same day at Southwest Florida International Airport.

CLOSE Southwest Florida veterans participated Saturday, May 4, 2019, in the Collier-Lee Honor Flight from Fort Myers to Washington, D.C. Brent Batten, brent.batten@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4776

In the end, they decided with some special accommodations, Keenly could go.

His determination to see the monuments to him and his fellow veterans played into the decision.

“I’m a patriot and I feel very strongly about this country. I went through quite a goddam lot to be here. I’ve never seen it (the Korean War Veterans Memorial). I want to see that our story was told,” said Keenly, one of 86 veterans — the largest contingent in group history — who made the daylong trip on a charter plane to view the war memorials in the nation’s capital.

Eighty-six veterans, 86 stories.

Keenly enlisted in the Marines while still in high school, right after the Korean War broke out.

A rifleman, he took part in the battle at the Chosin Reservoir, notorious for the bitter cold the Marines endured.

“I couldn’t tell you how many guys came back with black feet,” Keenly said, describing the effects of frostbite.

Wounded with shrapnel, he was out of action for 10 days.

“It could have been a helluva lot worse,” he said.

Stories like that of Bob Naum, a B-17 navigator based in England who flew 29 missions over western Europe during World War II. When not plotting a course with a sextant, pencil and paper, he manned a gun fending off German fighters. “I don’t think I ever knocked one down, but I shot a lot of shells at them,” Naum said.

He spent his 96th birthday Saturday in fine style, dancing to big band music and receiving kisses from Andrews Sisters lookalikes near the World War II Memorial.

All his squadron mates are gone, Naum said. “There must be something else someone wants me to do,” he said explaining his longevity.

“It was fantastic,” Naum said near the end of the 20-hour trip.

Or that of James Flanagan, 95. A Marine, Flanagan was learning to fly a dive bomber in preparation for the invasion of Japan when the war ended with the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “President Truman was nice enough to end the war,” Flanagan said.

He’s been to the World War II Memorial before, but never with a group of fellow veterans. “It brings it home now, more than then,” Flanagan said. “You realize what the service people did.”

There was Norma Jock, one of two female veterans on the trip and a Navy recruiter in New York City during the Vietnam War. She never served in Vietnam but being a recruiter in that era carried its own dangers, she recalled. “They blew up (a recruiting station) in the Bronx. They blew up one in Times Square,” she said.

And Joseph Lipps, who served with the Army’s 34th Engineers at the height of the Vietnam War.

Nearly blind, an impairment Lipps attributes to exposure to Agent Orange, although the government hasn’t acknowledged that, Lipps carried with him the names of 25 fallen comrades.

Honor Flight volunteers made pencil etchings of the names from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall and gave them to Lipps, so he can look at them up close under better light at home.

“I wasn’t expecting that,” Lipps said.

There were somber moments on the trip, to be sure. “It’s an emotional roller coaster,” said Rafael Lopez, one of the organizers.

“If you don’t well up with emotion on that sort of thing, you never will,” said Naples resident and Korean War era veteran Ray Nugent, leaving the changing of the guard ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.

But mostly, the mood was festive.

Arriving at Reagan National Airport the veterans and the volunteer guardians accompanying them were greeted by the 32-piece Falls Church, Va., concert band and well-wishers, some volunteers with Honor Flight in Washington, D.C., some simply travelers who walked over from their gates to shake a veteran’s hand and say, “Thank you.”

“That was a wonderful reception. I was in tears. It was just overwhelming, said Army veteran Theodore Cadieu. Although never in combat, some considered Cadieu the most important man in his unit. He was in charge of making sure everyone got paid.

He summed up what many feel about their military service.

“I got a life-changing experience from it. It instilled discipline in me, responsibility. It showed me I can be useful,” he said.

Throughout the day, spontaneous corridors of park visitors would form to thank the Honor Flight group as it made its way around the monuments.

Arriving back at Southwest Florida International, there was an even bigger welcome awaiting veterans.

Organizers estimate 3,000 people, the largest welcoming committee in the group’s six-year history, lined the terminal to shake hands and thank the veterans for their service. There were bands, JROTC units, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, veterans’ groups, costumed military personnel from different eras, flag-waving families and people with no affiliation other than to just thank a veteran.

“Don’t you dare write that I cried,” Nugent said making his way through the phalanx of greeters.

The number of World War II and Korean War veterans is dwindling. “History is leaving us quickly,” Honor Flight media coordinator Rick Wobbe said.

This trip, the local group’s 19th, included 15 veterans from World War II and 34 from Korea.

As the trend continues, the group will bring in Vietnam and Cold War era veterans take their place.

Chartering a plane costs about $130,000, gathered through donations. Storm Smart Shutters contributed $80,000 toward Mission 19.

The next trip is planned in September.

332,"Pine Forest hurdler, Pensacola Christian vaulter win state titles","CLOSE Tate High's Joey Zaszly has had a decorated career, which he is still building on, and plans for major success with South Alabama track and field BRIAN ACHATZ, bachatz@pnj.com

A pair of local high school track and field athletes put themselves atop the state podium on Saturday at the FHSAA State Championships in Jacksonville.

Pine Forest junior Koriyunna Arrington and Pensacola Christian's Blake Rimmer each claimed individual state championships, the latter taking the next step after finishing as Class 1A pole vault runner-up last season.

It's Pensacola's second-straight year with an individual state champion after Booker T. Washington's Tytavia Hardy won the Class 3A high jump state title last year.

Arrington won a state championship in the Class 3A 300-meter hurdles, edging out Amanda Kinloch of Pembroke Pines and four-time hurdling state champion Markalah Hart of Miami Northwestern with a personal-record 42.98 finish.

It was a second and a half faster than Arrington’s previous personal record in the event, her second personal best of the day after running 14.32 for fourth place in the 100-meter hurdles.

It's Pine Forest's first girl hurdling state championship since Eagles great Johna' Whitaker claimed the 300-meter titles in 2013. She also won back-to-back 100-meter titles in 2012 and 2013.

Arrington has won back-to-back region titles in the 100- and 300-meter hurdles. She placed seventh in the 100-meter finals and 21st in preliminaries for the 300-meter at last year’s state meet.

Arrington was part of another school record in Pine Forest’s third-place finish in the 4x100-meter relay, finishing behind Miami Northwestern and Northeast with a 46.04 finish.

Fellow sprinter Autaliah Williams-Gould placed sixth with Navarre’s Abigail Pantlitz seventh in the 100-meter dash. Pine Forest’s boys team took second in the 4x100-meter relay in a 41.38 finish.

Rimmer became the city’s first boys pole vaulting state champion from Class 1A on Saturday at the FHSAA state championships in Jacksonville.

Rimmer cleared 14-feet, 9 inches in his first-place finish, beating second and third-place finishers from Lakeland Christian. Fellow senior Braden Porter finished on the podium at fifth in clearing 13-9.

The state title required a personal best from Rimmer, who has won back-to-back region titles and finished as the Class 1A state runner-up last season.

On Friday night, Pace senior Erica Fisher nearly set a personal record in a third-place finish (10:41.44) in the 3,200-meter run. East Lake’s Parker Valby won the race with a state meet record 10:10.45.

She broke her school record in the 1,600-meter final, finishing third in a time of 5:00.52.

Fisher won back-to-back district titles and the 2019 region title in the 3,200-meter after moving to Pace from Tennessee, where she won a state championship as a sophomore. She’s signed to run with Tennessee-Martin collegiately.

Other point scorers at the FHSAA state meet included:

Washington’s Treyvor Motton, 3A 300m hurdles – 5th, 38.03

Pensacola Catholic’s Darion Lopez, 2A 400m – 8th, 50.16

Navarre’s 4x100-meter relay team – 8th, 42.28

338,Pensacola man accused of 'torturing' toddler transported from jail to hospital,"A Pensacola man accused of torturing his girlfriend's toddler with a shock collar and other implements was rushed from Escambia County Jail to a hospital late Thursday night.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, was arrested April 9 on drug and weapon possession charges and violation, according to an arrest report. In a press conference Wednesday, Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan announced Celaius was facing a second round of charges related to ""systemic torture"" of a young girl in his household.

According to a Escambia County spokesperson, after the new charges were announced, Celaius was transferred out of the jail's general population and into protective custody. Nonetheless, Celaius was transported to the hospital around 11 p.m. Wednesday.

Arrest: Pensacola man accused of 'systematic torture' and 'indescribable' abuse of 2-year-old

A county spokeswoman said because of patient privacy laws, she could not discuss the reason for the transport other than to say it was not fatal and that Celaius remained hospitalized.

During the press conference, Morgan described Celaius' alleged abuses as ""truly heinous,"" and said deputies had seized hours of self-recorded video of Celaius abusing the toddler.

Some of the allegations are that Celaius hit the girl with objects to keep her from sleeping, shocked her with an electric dog collar he placed around her neck and burned her with a lighter.

Celaius was being held in Escambia County Jail without bond, so he will presumably return to jail when he is discharged from the hospital. At this time, it is unclear how long Celaius will remain hospitalized.

340,Judge gives no jail time to bus driver who raped girl; thousands sign petition to have him removed,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Shane Piche.

(AP/WFLA) - A petition calling for the removal of a New York judge who sentenced a bus driver to probation, after the man pleaded guilty to raping a 14-year-old girl has more than 60,000 signatures.

""Judge James McClusky just let a child rapist off with a slap on the wrist. Remove him from his position immediately for his blatant disregard for survivors of sexual assault,"" wrote the petition's author, Shaunna Thomas.

McClusky drew ire last week when he sentenced Shane Piche to 10 years of probation.

Bus driver who pleaded guilty to raping 14-year-old girl gets no jail time

The 26-year-old was accused of raping the teenager at his residence in Watertown, New York, last summer. Piche, who was a bus driver in the victim’s school district, pleaded guilty to third-degree rape in February.

Piche also was required to register as a Level 1 sex offender, the lowest of three categories based on the risk of another offense. Three orders of protection were issued and Piche was ordered not to be left alone with anyone under the age of 17.

The sentencing drew national media attention and harsh criticism. Twitter users posted the phone number and address of McClusky’s chambers in Watertown.

“The Judge’s chambers have received numerous vitriolic calls regarding the case, the vast majority from out of State, by individuals who know nothing about the facts and circumstances of the case, thanks to social media,” state court spokesman Lucian Chalfen wrote in an email.

Chalfen said the judge was “well within” the sentencing range for this type of negotiated plea conviction. The maximum state prison time he could have received would have been from 1 1/3 to 4 years, he said.

Jefferson County chief assistant district attorney Patricia Dziuba said all parties acted within the parameters set by law and that the prosecutor handling the case sought up to six months of jail time along with probation, supervision and treatment. She declined to criticize the judge’s sentence.

Piche didn’t make a statement during his sentencing.

Calls seeking comment were left Tuesday with McCluskey and Piche’s attorney, Eric Swartz.

“He’ll be a felon for the rest of his life. He’s on the sex offender registry for a long time,” Swartz told television station WWNY of Watertown.

The station said a victim impact statement given to them by the victim’s mother read, “I wish Shane Piche would have received time in jail for the harm he caused to my child. He took something from my daughter she will never get back and has caused her to struggle with depression and anxiety.”

Thomas' petition has been circulating for less than two days and already has over 60,000 signatures. The goal is to reach 75,000.

342,Pensacola man accused of 'systematic torture' and 'indescribable' abuse of 2-year-old,"A Pensacola man has been arrested for what Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan described as the ""systematic torture"" and horrific abuse of a 2-year-old girl.

“The truly heinous nature of this crime is in some cases truly indescribable,” Morgan said.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, is accused of not allowing a 2-year-old girl to sleep, using a variety of ways to shock her out of sleep if she drifted off. He utilized methods such as throwing half empty and then full bottles of milk at her as she began to nod off to sleep or had just fallen asleep, according to ECSO Chief Deputy Chip Simmons.

Investigators obtained video clips, allegedly made by Celaius, of him placing an electric-dog collar around her neck and electrocuting her awake, Simmons said. When the girl woke up she was faced with the sight of Celaius starring down at her wearing a werewolf mask.

“You can image a 2-year-old child being awoke in the middle of the night,” Morgan said, “and she is starring at this frightful image.”

Celaius also allegedly shot her with an airsoft gun.

Morgan said Celaius was the boyfriend of the child’s mother, but not the girl’s father.

The mother was originally arrested for neglect and was released after making bond, Morgan said. But the Sheriff’s Office and the State Attorney’s Office no longer believes she was aware of what Celaius had been doing to her child.

“When we played the videos to her, she … she acted appropriately,” Morgan said, indicating the mother had become highly upset.

According to investigators, the abuses came to light after the girl’s mother took her to Sacred Heart Hospital after discovering markings on the girl’s skin. The mother thought the marks were caused by an illness, possibly ringworm.

But, investigators said, emergency room physicians quickly informed the mom that the marks were not the result of ring worm and that the discolorations could only be the result of burns.

The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office was contacted and an investigation into possible child abuse was opened.

Celaius used a lighter to burn the child, Morgan said.

Simmons said investigators seized hours of recorded footage of Celaius abusing the girl, which he had filmed on multiple cameras and cellphone cameras.

According to Simmons, Celaius placed a call from jail to a friend, Eric Everett Furnans. Celaius asked Furnans to destroy his cellphone, which he allegedly did.

Furnans was arrested Wednesday and faces charges of evidence destruction, tampering with evidence, possession of drug paraphernalia, three counts of possession of a controlled substance without a prescription and possession of marijuana.

343,FHP: 3 teens ejected when suspected drunk driver flips van,"COLUMBIA COUNTY, Fla. - A 40-year-old mother has been charged with DUI after three teens were thrown from a van in a rollover crash Tuesday morning on I-10 in Columbia County, troopers said.

None of the teens was wearing a seat belt, according to the Florida Highway Patrol report.

The report said Shemeaka Burnett was driving her Chevy Venture west on I-10 when she lost control for unknown reasons and the van flipped, ejecting an 18-year-old girl, a 16-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl.

The 16-year-old was critically injured and was taken to UF Health Shands Hospital. The 15-year-old suffered serious injuries, and the 18-year-old and Burnett suffered minor injuries.

Social media accounts appear to indicate the teens are Burnett's children. The report lists them as Fayetteville, North Carolina, residents, but News4Jax found records indicating they recently lived in Panama City, Florida.

Burnett is being charged with DUI causing serious bodily injury and careless driving, according to the FHP report.

344,911 calls detail trampoline park injuries in Central Florida,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - Broken bones, dislocated joints and injuries to patrons' heads and necks are just some of the medical calls that paramedics have responded to at Central Florida trampoline parks, 911 calls placed from those entertainment facilities reveal.

Typically located in strip malls and warehouses, the parks provide children and adults with a place to jump on trampolines of different shapes, sizes and angles. Many facilities also feature trampoline pits filled with foam blocks, dodge ball arenas or obstacle course elements like warped walls and tightropes.

""We had an accident,"" an employee of Hangar 15 in Daytona Beach told an emergency dispatcher last November. ""It sounds like a little girl fell off one of our ledges and hit her head on the way down. Her parents asked me to call 911. She just puked.""

The 4-year-old girl, whose identity was not released due to medical privacy laws, had been jumping into a trampoline filled with foam blocks from an elevated height when she struck her head on the edge of the pit, according to her father.

""She's not bleeding but her mother was rocking her. She's telling her, 'Don't rock me. Don't rock me. It hurts,'"" the father explained to the 911 dispatcher. ""She basically (lost consciousness). She never closed her eyes, but she's not herself right now.""

A spokesperson for Hangar 15 said the company could not provide an update on the child's condition or comment about any particular incident, citing their respect for patrons' privacy.

CBS News reports that at least six people have died of injuries at trampoline parks in the past seven years.

Nearly 18,000 emergency room visits were caused by trampoline park injuries in 2017 nationwide, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a significant increase from the 2,500 injuries reported just four years earlier.

The International Association of Trampoline Parks said those injury numbers are lower or on par with youth sports such as soccer, basketball and volleyball.

The industry trade group attributes the recent increase in injury reports to the growing number of trampoline parks.

""The industry has grown steadily since 2011 when we saw 40 parks worldwide. Now we have over 1,200 across the U.S. and all over the world,"" said Bethany Evans, executive vice president of IATP. ""You can have positive experiences at parks if you just follow the rules and take some precautions with safety.""

Adults and children sustaining injuries, 911 calls show

An employee of Outer Limitz Indoor Trampoline Arena in Orlando called 911 in July 2017 to report that an approximately 30-40 year-old woman had broken her leg.

""Her daughter said that she tried to jump across the trampoline,"" the employee told the 911 dispatcher. ""And the mom attempted it. And she said she thinks her leg just buckled. And it didn't end well.""

""Is there any serious bleeding?"" the dispatcher asked.

""No, but you can see a bone looked like it popped out of place,"" the employee responded.

An 11-year-old boy reportedly broke his arm at that same trampoline park in February 2018, according to another 911 call.

Orlando Fire Department crews responded to Airheads Adventure Arena in Orlando last October to assist an injured boy.

""A parent told her son to try to do a flip and he landed on his back. But he said his neck cracked,"" the employee reported. ""His eyes are rolling back.""

At Sky Zone in Daytona Beach, a child playing dodge ball needed medical attention last summer.

""A little girl just popped her shoulder out of place. Can I get an ambulance, please?"" a manager asked the 911 dispatcher.

Two weeks later, a 19-year-old man reportedly suffered a similar injury.

""I just had someone jump into the foam, possibly dislocated his shoulder,"" said the employee.

At Sky Zone Space Coast in Rockledge, an 11-year-old boy was screaming as he awaited paramedics to treat his knee injury.

""He was just bouncing, and we tried to get him up and he's just not getting up,"" the employee told dispatchers.

Few lawsuits filed against trampoline parks in Central Florida

A News 6 review of court records found very few lawsuits filed against Central Florida's trampoline parks.

A mother sued Hangar 15 for negligence in September 2017 claiming her 16-year-old son jumped from the warped wall and was significantly injured.

Three months later, another woman filed a lawsuit against Hangar 15 alleging that her son was hurt when a trampoline propelled him onto a set of unpadded steps.

Confidential settlements were reached in both cases, court records show.

While the cases were still in litigation, attorneys representing Hangar 15 pointed out that authorized adults signed liability waivers on behalf of the minors.

""By signing this agreement, I am giving up my rights and the rights of my spouse and/or child(ren) to sue Hangar 15 for any injury, including paralysis or death, caused in whole or in part by the negligence or fault of Hangar 15,"" the participant release states.

Legal experts believe such liability releases deter injured participants from filing lawsuits.

In addition, some waivers contain forced arbitration clauses that make it more difficult for customers to take trampoline park operators to court.

""Trampoline parks want to avoid justice. They want to rig the system against anyone who is injured who may assert claims against them,"" said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal.

The Connecticut Democrat is sponsoring a bill that would eliminate forced arbitration clauses in consumer cases.

""Congress should have a role here ... but the biggest deterrent to death and injury at these parks will be the park owners being hauled into court, held responsible, deemed culpable, having to pay,"" Blumenthal told CBS News.

Trampoline park operators respond to News 6

Although representatives from Hangar 15 did not comment on the lawsuits, a company spokesperson told News 6, ""The safety and well-being of our visitors is a top priority, and we adhere to the strictest standards prescribed by the International Association of Trampoline Parks.""

The owner of Airheads Adventure Arena acknowledged that injuries can occur at trampoline parks but he said no one has ever filed an insurance claim against his company, which operates five trampoline parks in Florida and Minnesota.

""I've seen some parks that are poorly run and taking chances,"" Russ Pikus told News 6. ""The first words out of my mouth are, 'Safety. Safety. Safety. Safety.'""

After buying three existing trampoline parks in Florida three years ago, Pikus said he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars bringing the facilities up to trampoline park standards set by ASTM International.

""I can go to bed at night knowing I've done everything possible to keep our patrons safe,"" Pikus said.

In response to this report, a Sky Zone spokesperson provided the following statement:

“At Sky Zone, the safety of our guests is our top priority and we are committed to ongoing safety evaluations. As with any physical activity or sport, there are inherent risks. We invest in best-in-class equipment and take several measures to reduce these risks, such as daily equipment and area spot checks, and educate our guests about safety by posting important safety rules and guidelines throughout our parks. Additionally, we station court monitors near all trampoline attractions to help enforce those rules and monitor guest activity. When there is an injury, all incidents are analyzed internally and we consult with third-party industry experts to continuously learn from them and create the safest environment possible for Guests.”

After a representative with Outer Limitz provided News 6 with an email address, the company did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment for this story.

Industry trade group taking steps to minimize injuries

Unlike at least 11 other states, Florida does not regulate trampoline parks or conduct mandatory inspections.

Even without state oversight, the International Association of Trampoline Parks plans to require its member parks to be evaluated by outside inspectors.

""We are looking to require third party inspections so that parents and visitors of our parks can have an extra layer of understanding and comfortability when they go visit a park to know ... they are operating with guest safety at the forefront of their agenda,"" said Evans.

The industry trade group shared the following recommendations for guests visiting trampoline parks:

1. Never jump without a court monitor stationed at the activity.

2. Be certain to read all rules and regulations posted throughout the park.

3. Make sure to watch a safety video or have a safety briefing from staff.

4. Always be aware of your surroundings, and never jump around or near other jumpers.

5. If the park has a foam pit, make sure the foam is at or above the level of the trampoline.

""The AITP works tirelessly to improve industry standards and to make sure we're creating positive experiences for guests that visit our member parks,"" Evans told News 6.

345,Florida man who tossed daughter off bridge found guilty of murder,"CLEARWATER, Fla. - A Florida jury has found a man guilty of first-degree murder for dropping his 5-year-old daughter off a Tampa Bay area bridge four years ago.

Jurors in Clearwater deliberated for about seven hours over two days before convicting 29-year-old John Jonchuck.

[PREVIOUS: Jurors weigh case of dad accused of tossing girl off Florida bridge | Florida man who dropped daughter off bridge claims insanity]

No one disputed that Jonchuck dropped his daughter Phoebe 62 feet into Tampa Bay in January 2015.

But prosecutors claimed Jonchuck's action was premeditated and that he acted out of anger against Phoebe's mother and his own mother. They said he knew what he was doing was wrong.

His defense attorney said during closing arguments that Jonchuck was insane, and delusions led him to believe Phoebe was possessed.

346,"6-year-old Florida girl dies after shooting, search for suspect still underway","- Six-year-old Elizabelle Frenel, who was one of three victims shot during a domestic dispute in Haines City earlier this week, has died.

Haines City Police Department said that there was a domestic dispute at the Citrus Ridge Apartments on Friday night. They say that 38-year-old Ernst Cherizard shot 23-year-old Eli Normil and her daughter, Elizabelle.

When Normil's family came to check on her, Cherizard reportedly told them she wasn't there. Her aunt, 48-year-old Nicole Guillume, returned to the apartment and an argument ensued. That's when police say Cherizard shot Guillume, killing her.

When officers arrived to the scene, they found Eli and Normil dead. Elizabelle was alive but brain dead. She was shot three times, including once in the head. Elizabelle was transported to the Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando. She was pronounced dead late on Saturday night, despite doctor's efforts to save her life.

Police are still searching for the suspected gunman, Ernest Cherizard. They say that he fled in a burgundy 2011 Nissan Altima, license plate GZN C82. He is armed and dangerous. A toll booth 200 miles away near Fort Lauderdale recorded the plate early Saturday.

The victims' family is stunned. “I was traumatized,” said Normil’s brother, Annel, “I spoke to her two days ago and she was like 'I'm doing good bro, I'm working.' She's the manager at one of the fast food restaurants in the Haines City area.”

“I don't really know him that much. He always talk to me like he care for my sister. That he want to marry her, one day. He always seemed cool to me. I don't think he would ever have done something like that,” Annel Normil added.

The victim's family has set up a GoFundMe page to pay for their funerals and other expenses.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/6-year-old-florida-girl-dies-after-shooting-search-for-suspect-still-underway,2019-04-14T13:09:00Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

348,2-year-old Florida girl dies after being left in hot car all day,"PENSACOLA, Fla. - A 36-year-old Florida woman slept as her 2-year-old daughter died in a car parked outside her apartment, authorities said.

The Pensacola News Journal reported that Jessica Monell faces charges of homicide-neglect manslaughter, child neglect and possession of a controlled substance.

Escambia County Sheriff's Maj. Andrew Hobbs said Monell arrived at the Aqua Porta Apartments around 6 a.m. Wednesday, went inside and apparently fell asleep until shortly before 4 p.m. He said she left her daughter, Joy Monell, in the car until then.

Hobbs said investigators found three bags containing suspected crystal meth and other drugs in Monell's home.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recorded a heat index of 82 degrees in Pensacola on Wednesday.

356,Panama City Team Dragonair takes off in a flying machine that belongs in a fantasy movie,"CLOSE Jeff Elkins of Panama City designed a flying machine. Mariah Cain is its pilot. The pair's prototype is a GoFly contest finalist. Courtesy of GoFly Prize, Tallahassee Democrat

Mariah Cain and Jeff Elkins have always dreamed of flying.

Not within the confines of a helicopter or airplane, but unenclosed, immersed in their surroundings and soaring over hills and waterscapes.

It’s no longer just a fantasy.

The Panama City duo has designed the Airboard, a personal flight device that lifts off the ground using eight motors, maneuvered by body movement. Cain is its pilot and project manager, and Elkins is the brains behind the mechanics, along with colleague Ray Brandes.

""Team Dragonair"" is one of five Phase II winners of the GoFly Prize, a global challenge to create a safe, quiet and compact flying device that can travel 20 miles without refueling or recharging.

“We don't really call it flying ... it's levitating, it's lifting. You can just sit in one spot like a helicopter, but it doesn't cost $2 million and anybody can do it,” Elkins said.

The 56-year-old inventor has worked in the field of prosthetics, created LED suits and architectural renderings. His fascination with electronics started with designing model airplanes in his high school wood shop class.

Cain used to work at a 3D imaging company in Arizona, proofreading manuals. As a little girl, she tinkered with her grandfather in his metalworking shop in their small hometown of Thatcher, Arizona.

With aviation a male-dominated field, Cain aims to break gender norms and expectations.

Thrill isn't new to the nimble 24-year-old athlete, who met Elkins playing Hydroflight, where people on hoverboards are propelled into the air by water-jet propulsion. Together they merged their skills in building, testing and flying the Airboard.

“It lifts from underneath you so since you're on top of it, it doesn't feel like you're flying a machine. It just feels like you're gliding in the air, like you're sliding across ice,” said Cain, who’s the only woman captain among the Phase II winners.

In a video, she’s seen standing on the Airboard prototype, gliding in mid-air over a lake in St. Marys, Georgia.

The electric-powered Airboard can push 100 feet into the air and zoom as the pilot stands buckled in the middle holding two poles. The prototype can only operate for five minutes after take-off, but the team has been toiling in the shop working on the Airboard 2.0, which will be able to fly for more than 30 minutes, Elkins said.

Sponsored by Boeing, the GoFly competition, founded by entrepreneur Gwen Lighter, will award a grand prize winner in the fall.

“The way that we fly now in these big airplanes is not what anyone pictured. It's this experience of flying yourself around like you are a bird unguided through the air,” Cain said. “I've certainly been dreaming of it since I was a little girl. And getting to experience this now — it's unlike anything else.”

Safety measures are in place that allow the Airboard to continue to fly even if half the motors glitch, according to a press release, and the team is also incorporating a parachute system.

Elkins compares the aerial vehicle to a “motorcycle in the sky” and a ""Jetsons"" car.

The team hopes their device can be replicated and used for fun, but also employed in rescue efforts or other industry-specific needs.

“I'm just going to keep working on this for the rest of my life,” Elkins said. “However long it takes to get this to be something mainstream and acceptable.”

360,Tampa Bay serial killer fighting against lethal injection; claims it cruel and unusual punishment,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

TAMPA, Fla. - A serial killer who stalked and murdered at least eight women in Tampa Bay is set to be executed in less than three weeks. Bobby Joe Long is due in court today for a hearing where his attorneys will argue that lethal injection is cruel and unusual punishment. Long’s attorney says his client suffers from epilepsy and they will argue that lethal injection isn't good for his health condition and will ask for another method for him to go out.

Last month Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a death warrant for one of Tampa Bay's most well-known serial killers. Long, now 65, was convicted of killing eight women in Hillsborough County and at least two other women in Pinellas and Pasco counties in the 1980s.

News Channel 8 spoke exclusively with a former prosecutor on the case and he said he's glad to see the victim's families get some sort of justice after all these years.

“Ugh, he was an absolute sicko. He is an arrogant son of a b. He was an arrogant guy. He used to go, his big start was rapes. He would answer ads where the parents were trying to sell their baby furniture. So he would go to the house hoping to find the little girl or the mommy there,” said Allen Allweiss, former prosecutor.

363,"Teen injured, adult arrested after car surfing incident","- A car surfing adventure left a 13-year-old girl with a swollen, bloody face, and sent her 20-year-old former friend, Alexia Heckendorn, to jail on a charge of child abuse.

“She looked like her face has been beat up with a bat or something. Initially I thought someone jumped her because of all the knots across her face,” said Shanika Brown.

Brown says she got a call from the girls who were with her daughter saying her daughter had been hit by a car, but she said she quickly learned it was all a lie.

“I was livid when I found out,” Brown said.

Deputies say the incident started across the street from Deltona Middle School. A few of Brown's daughter’s friends were meeting their ride home.

“My daughter was sitting on top of a car talking to people she thought was her friends and out of nowhere the girl hit the gas and took her down the whole road videotaped it the whole time thought it was funny until she got slung of the vehicle and hit the ground face first,” said Brown.

According to Heckendorn’s arrest affidavit, she and the other girls in the car told investigators they were going slow and that the victim thought it was fun, refusing to get off the car. Sheriff Chitwood tells The News Station video one of the girls posted to social media proves otherwise.

“The video clearly shows this isn't going at 1mph that they're going at a pretty good clip,” said Sheriff Chitwood.

Investigators say it was as Heckendorn tried to navigate a 90 degree curve that the victim flew off the car and slammed onto the road.

“She said when she woke back up, she was on the ground and blood was coming out of her face,” said Brown.

Brown says her daughter was left with a concussion, road rash and several knots on her face. She's thankful deputies are now holding Heckendorn responsible.

“This 20 year old is learning that when you do things like that there are consequences,” said Brown.

Heckendorn is out of jail on bond.

367,Orange County child nearly drowns hours after advocates raise swim safety awareness,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - A one-year-old Orange County girl is recovering in the hospital after fire officials said she nearly drowned in a family pool Wednesday afternoon.



Orange County Fire Rescue responded to the home on Herbinson Drive. Officials said they found the girl unconscious and unresponsive. She was revived and taken to a local hospital for treatment.



This happened hours after first responders and child safety organizations held a news conference to raise swim safety awareness.



OCFR Division Chief David Rathbun said with summer around the corner, more families will spend time in the water and parents need to pay attention.



""That's just mind-boggling when you put that statistic out there that 1 to 4 years olds the leading cause of death is drowning and it is so preventable. It just is,"" Rathbun said.



So far in 2019, the Florida Department of Children and Families said 10 children have died from drowning, including 2-year-old twins in Lake County last month.



According to DCF, the agency investigated almost 250 child drownings across the state over the past three years.



Prashant Patel with the Children's Safety Village of Central Florida said child drownings are preventable.



""We take this time to come together to bring awareness to water safety and to stress the importance of water safety and the importance of safety and swimming lessons,"" Patel said.



Child safety advocates are calling on parents to pay attention and keep children safe. They said drownings can happen anywhere at any time and in a second.



Safety experts are encouraging families to have a water watcher whose only job is to monitor the water. They add families should put up barriers around pools and know CPR in case of an emergency.

Sheriff John Mina weighed in on the importance of water safety.

""We hear these stories every single summer about children who may be left unattended and then find themselves near a body of water and then the unimaginable happens,"" Mina said.

Ashley Kruse said she put her 2-year-old daughter Tallulah in swim lessons a year ago. She said she has peace of mind knowing her daughter can stay safe around water.

""I think it's a critical life skill down here. There are too many bodies of water to not have her be able to swim,"" Kruse said.



Earlier this year, the Orange County Sheriff's Office posted a video with five tips to prevent drownings, click here to view the video.

369,Video of teen asking wrong girl to prom goes viral,"Promposals have become the standard for boys to ask girls to prom.

Nevada teen Austin Mousa had his plan all figured out. He showed up on a girl’s doorstep with a box of doughnuts, ready to ask her to prom, with a friend, Johnny Pashales, capturing it all on video.

The door opens, and that’s when it all goes wrong. It was the wrong girl, according to USA Today.

Apparently, Mousa’s friend was confident he knew which house was correct, but man was he wrong.

In the video, you can hear the girl say, “Oh my gosh,” as she opens the door sees the promposal.

Mousa then looks at his friend, who was laughing while recording the interaction, and says, “Johnny, you picked the wrong house.”

371,2nd girl dies after car crash along I-95 in Deerfield Beach,"Akeena (left) and Keana Bennett were killed after a car crash along Interstate 95.

DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. - A 5-year-old girl who was seriously injured in a car crash Sunday along Interstate 95 in Deerfield Beach has died, her family said.

According to the Florida Highway Patrol, two cars collided around 11 a.m. Sunday just north of Sample Road, shutting down a portion of the highway for six hours. Keana Bennett, 5, and her 2-year-old sister, Akeena, were critically injured in the crash.

Akenna died after being rushed to Broward Health Medical Center on Sunday. Keana was taken to the same hospital and placed on life support, but she died Monday.

Troopers said both girls were not using car seats or wearing seat belts.

""Words can’t express tonight how I feel -- losing my two nieces,"" said Suzette Scott, the girls' aunt.

The family said the girls were riding with their godmother, 34-year-old Raby Rashida. Troopers said Rashida also hurt in the crash, but her injuries were described as not life-threatening. The family said Rashida and the girls were on their way to church at the time of the crash.

The family gathered at the same church Monday night to remember Keana and Akeena.

""We are all mourning. We are all in distress. So we are gathering as a family to try to comfort each other,"" said Barbara Scott, the girls' grandmother.

The girls' mother posted a video on Facebook, asking for prayers.

""I’m just asking you guys to keep us in your prayers,"" she said. ""Both of my kids are gone. Two babies gone. It breaks my heart to lose them both.""

379,"Fort Pierce man, 22, who died in car crash remembered by friend as 'the light of everyone'","Brian Santos died May 1 after a car crash. His friends said he loved cars and jet skis. (Photo: Courtesy of Jailene Echevarria)

FORT PIERCE— Brian Santos' passions in life were building and racing cars, said his girlfriend of a year, Jailene Echevarria.

""We loved building cars, but he hated getting grease under his nails,"" she said. ""The car that he crashed in was a Honda that he had just finished building.""

Shayne Stokes, a traffic homicide investigator for the Fort Pierce Police Department, said Santos was driving a Honda Civic Wednesday around noon west in the 700 block of El Rancho Drive.

Stokes said Santos' car veered to the right and went off the road and crashed into two mailboxes, a tree and a telephone pole.

The 22-year-old was dead when Fort Pierce police officers got to the scene, police said. Santos was the only person in the car.

Brian Santos (left) and his girlfriend, Jailene Echevarria (right.) The two planned to have a home and have children one day together. Santos died Wednesday after a car crash. (Photo: Courtesy of Jailene Echevarria)

Echevarria said Santos enjoyed working on his Nissan Infiniti Q50 and had recently finished building the Civic he was driving when he crashed. She said he bought the frame of the Honda and put together the motor, transmission and other parts of the inside of the car.

""He started taking everything apart (on the Honda) and putting new pieces in,"" she said. ""He just made the car the way he wanted it. He was really smart.""

Echevarria said Santos worked at C & L Florida Marble And Granite on Naco Road in Fort Pierce, installing granite counter tops.

She said she spoke with Santos Wednesday morning before she left for work and told him she loved him and kissed him goodbye.

Echevarria said right before the crash, Santos was driving around the block test driving the Honda and then planned to go see his best friend at work.

Jennifer Garcia met Santos through her husband and said the 22-year-old had a quirky smile and an outgoing personality.

“Brian was the light of everyone,"" Garcia said. “You didn’t need to know him for long for you to just fall in love with Brian.”

Garcia said Santos often joked with her and called her his “gordita,” which means chubby girl, affectionately, in Spanish.

She said Santos turned 22 on April 5 and celebrated his birthday with Garcia’s family.

An investigation is ongoing into the cause of the crash, Stokes said.

""I don't believe drugs or alcohol has played any part in this crash,"" Stokes said.

The Honda was demolished, officers said.

Echevarria said she and Santos talked about having a family of their own one day and buying a house together.

""I just really miss him and I wish whatever happened to him wasn't real,"" she said.

380,Crystal Lake Elementary in Lakeland partnering with community to help students,"“We just want to see the children thrive.” — Crystal Lake Elementary Principal Kristan Fowler

LAKELAND — The sounds of hammering could be heard Thursday coming from two portables on the Crystal Lake Elementary School campus. Workmen continue to transform the buildings into a community clinic that will be available beginning Monday to the school’s 470 students, as well as their parents, neighbors and anyone who walks through the door.

“Our target audience is the 33801 zip code,” said Andrea Hagan, director of the unique community partnership with the school. The clinic will have a doctor, nurse practitioner and dentist on staff and will take health insurance as well as payments on a sliding scale of ability to pay. “Our families were predominantly receiving health care at the emergency room, so there was not preventative care or follow-up care.”

Hagan graduated from Southeastern University with degrees in elementary education and psychology and has spent many years working for Florida Baptist Children’s Home and then Heartland for Children, one of the five core partners with the school. The others are nearby Southeastern University, United Way of Central Florida, Central Florida Health Care, all working with Polk County Public Schools on the project.

Crystal Lake was awarded the community school pilot program two years ago, with core partners signing a 25-year memorandum of understanding, promising to provide financial support, medical and social aid, along with academic enhancement for several generations. They are providing after-school tutoring and will have before-school help, along with weekend academic help at the school as they build more partnerships. The tutoring is available outside of regular school hours because all of the students live in the working-class neighborhood around the school.

It is designed to break the cycle of poverty and improve student performance, based on similar programs in Hillsborough and Orange counties.

""No one can do their best in school or at work when they are hungry, sick or in pain,"" said Christina Criser, CEO of United Way of Central Florida. ""The holistic services at the Crystal Lake Community Partnership School addresses needs for students, families, and the community at large.""

Crystal Lake Elementary Principal Kristan Fowler said there is already an impact.

“The discipline (issue) has come down,” Fowler said, noting there are fewer referrals to the office and suspensions. “I start talking about it and I get so emotional — all these opportunities for our children here.”

Fowler has more than two decades of education experience and is in her second year as a principal. She was an assistant principal at Boswell Elementary in Auburndale and has spent time teaching fifth, third and first grades.

It is difficult to nail down an exact program cost, but three positions filled this year, along with contracted services, cost about $420,000, with the George Jenkins Foundation and the Iron Horse Foundation donating through United Way. The Givewell Foundation and Publix charities have also donated funding.

In addition to Hagan, there is a health and wellness coordinator, along with a parents and family engagement coordinator.

The groups and businesses send in volunteers to read with kindergartners and help students plant and tend to a vegetable and flower garden. They also provide food and clothing to the Title I students, most of whom qualify for free or reduced cost lunches. The Girl Scouts are on campus, as is Central Florida Health Care’s Mobile Kitchen to teach families about healthy and nutritious eating. A recent partnership and pizza event saw 250 people show up.

Classes are going to be offered for parents, based on things they have said they want, including financial, job and computer training, along with English language classes because foreign-born families want to assimilate.

Fowler and Hagan said some students are dealing with more than poverty: Some have educational or learning challenges, there are behavior issues, many come from single-parent homes or abusive situations, and some routinely go hungry.

Two fifth-graders who have attended the school for several years have seen a positive change.

“I got suspended for fighting,” said 11-year-old Enrique Hernandez, explaining the punishment straightened out his behavior. “I should not fight because school is not for fighting, it’s for learning. I’ve never been back to the office.”

He was one of four students rewarded for his improved behavior and grades with VIP treatment at a recent Lakeland Magic game.

“Kindness reminds the kids that they’re special, that they can succeed,” Hagan said.

Fowler and Hagan have implemented a positive behavior program based on “houses,” like in Harry Potter books. Their houses are based on character traits and are called Courage, Perseverance, Integrity and Loyalty. They even have their own T-shirts. The house with most points at the end of the school year is getting a trip to Legoland.

Shaelynn Cox, 11, said the positive behavior program has helped her be a better student and classmate.

“I’ve gotten extra recess, ice cream,” Shaelynn said. When asked what the best part of Crystal Lake Elementary is, she said, “Getting to learn — the teachers are nice.”

As Fowler walked down a sidewalk, students darted to her side, arms outstretched for hugs. Fowler says she worries about her students even when she is not at school, adding there is one little boy whom she never sees smile.

“I just want to take him home and rock him and tell him, ‘You’re going to grow up and be somebody important,’” Fowler said. “We just want to see the children thrive.”

382,Pensacola Children's Chorus creates legacy in patriotism and lifelong friendships,"Lights dim and the orchestra plays. The curtain rises to reveal a familiar song you love but weren't expecting. Excitement builds as the audience taps their feet. Talented, eager young singers on stage greet you with a smile. This is what arts patrons have come to expect each year from the Pensacola Children’s Chorus Showtime performance.



On May 3, 4 and 5, PCC and its 280 singers will dazzle the audience at the Saenger Theatre with sights and sounds from musicals, television shows and popular music. Showtime is designed to showcase songs from the stage and screen, paying tribute to many incredible artists and performers.



“What I love about our Showtime performances are how our young people can take iconic music and perform it in a way that is just as — if not more — inspirational,” said Alex Gartner, artistic and executive director of PCC. “Showtime brings out both the individual and collective talents of our singers.”



This year’s Showtime will have songs in it for everyone. They are pulling out music from popular movie-musicals such as Mary Poppins Returns, Mamma Mia and The Greatest Showman. Singers will perform a mash-up in the Land of Oz with music from The Wizard of Oz, Wicked, and The Wiz. They are giving a nod to Pensacola heritage with a fun Mardi Gras-themed set. In addition, they are including such diverse music as Latin American influences to Rodgers & Hammerstein and Freddie Mercury. There will be a mix of everything for every attendee.

Music selection from Showtime is 100 percent influenced by the singers in PCC. Artistic direction is geared toward a balance of what singers request and what audience members may be hoping for during shows.



“For years we’ve heard pleas to include music from artists like ABBA and Queen,” said Gartner. “We’ve decided to oblige this year.”

Like most PCC shows, there will also be a patriotic theme to pay tribute to U.S. armed forces. PCC singers often perform at local retirement communities and sing to servicewomen and men. This is a highlight for many of the singers in PCC, and it will be an integral part of Showtime. Gartner says he normally has a hard time picking a favorite set from the show, but he has a special place for the patriotism music that will be performed.



“I can’t wait for our patriotic tribute,” said Gartner. “Pensacola loves its country, and I think one of the greatest goals of music education is to preserve our country’s rich musical history through the teaching of timeless patriotic songs.”



In addition to honoring the real military men and women in the audience, 19 graduating seniors will be honored at Showtime intermission. More than half of these seniors have been a part of PCC for more than five years, several for 10 years.



“The Pensacola Children’s Chorus has meant so much to our family,” said Robin Akerman, who with her husband Daniel are the parents of Sara Akerman, a 10-year PCC singer and graduating senior. “She went from a shy girl who lacked confidence to being a caring, confident leader with a bright future centered around service to others. PCC has allowed Sara to explore her love of music, perform for the community and help other musicians shine to their full potential.

""Through her experiences at PCC, our daughter has made lifelong friendships that she otherwise would not have developed, and those relationships have transcended school and church and built bridges across the greater Pensacola community.”

Gartner echoes the same feelings as the Akermans, noting that it is the friendships and families that make PCC so special. He is honored to direct this special group that is more than just a children’s choir.



“PCC is family and the heart of our community,” said Gartner. “As we approach the 30th anniversary, we are anticipating about 300 singers. That equals 300 families. Then when you consider our audience members and the alumni who still contribute to PCC, the numbers grow to thousands that spread across the nation. It reaches far and wide. Our connection may not be blood, but we are connected by music. PCC is a legacy that shapes individuals and strengthens relationships that last a lifetime.”

Tickets for the Friday night, Saturday night and Sunday matinee shows are still available at the Pensacola Saenger Theatre box office and ticketmaster.com. Interested future legacy members, singers and volunteers can call 850.434.7760 to audition for a chance to join the PCC family.

383,Master trainers transform wild Mustangs into performance horses,"- You'll see amazing things at an Extreme Mustang Makeover. Trainers from all over are matched with an American Mustang, a wild horse, virtually untouched by humans, and get about 100 days to gentle that horse, train it, then compete for cash and prizes.

Sponsored by the Texas-based Mustang Heritage Foundation, the Makeover is coming to Ocala, Florida on May 10 and 11, and trainers from the Bay Area are hard at work training their Mustangs and creating a routine to wow the judges.

Angel Lopez of Tampa is teaching her 4-year-old Mustang mare from Adobe Town, Wyoming what she'll need to know to compete against dozens of other horses.

""They have to be able to walk, trot, canter, whoa, back up. That is the bare basics,"" Lopez said.

She's impressed with the willingness of her young mare to do what's asked of her with enthusiasm.

Continue reading below

""She has surpassed everything I've expected of her. There's nothing she really can't do,"" Lopez said.

Angel's little sister, 14-year-old Alexa Lopez is training 10-month-old Peanut Butter Cup for the youth division of the Extreme Mustang Makeover. She'll show what this little filly can do in hand, no riding.

Little ""Peanut"" was sick when she first got her the end of January, they couldn't even start training until a few weeks ago. Alexa says it was touch and go for a while.

""We found out she had shipping fever, so she was sick, and we couldn't really do much training. I was very worried. We weren't sure if she was going to make it,"" Alexa said.

The girls' mom, Jackie Lopez, was worried too. She supports her daughters 100%, but she also holds her breath quite often watching them.

Says Lopez, ""When they first get a wild Mustang, the mom part of me is like 'Be careful, honey. Be careful. Their talent is amazing and I'm in awe of them!""

Down Interstate 4 in the community of Davenport, 16-year-old Rory Loyal is training for his third Extreme Mustang Makeover. He named his yearling Hekate, which means goddess of magic.

""She might be the smartest one I've gotten so far,"" Loyal said.

Rory comes from a long line of performers on horseback - 9th generation - and he dreams of eventually having his own act with American Mustangs. His mom, Liz says he's a natural.

Says Liz Loyal, ""Rory is really hoping to make a name for himself in horse training and I think he's well on his way.""

Ginger MacPhee is on the way to riding barrels with her 6-year-old mare from Salt Wells, Wyoming, Mahiah.

""I think we're going to make it. I'm excited to see what she'll come up with. She's a good girl,"" said MacPhee.

This is her first Makeover and she's already a fan.

""It's my very first one and it's been a fun experience. A lot of challenges and it's actually taught me a lot about myself and about horses,"" she said.

One thing all of these trainers have in common is their mission. Not to win, although that would be nice.

All four want to see their Mustangs get auctioned off to good homes when the competition is over.

""My main goal is find her a good home. It's not about competing with other people. It's about finding these guys a good home,"" Ginger MacPhee said.

Angel Lopez added, ""I'm there to show her off so she can get a good home. That's what matters most to me.""

The Extreme Mustang Makeover in Ocala will take place Friday and Saturday, May 10 and 11 at the Southeast Livestock Pavilion in Ocala, Florida. It's free and open to the public, except for the Top 10 Freestyle competition Saturday evening. Those tickets are $15.

Deputies said that, three days after Stavris’ release, a complaint was made against him that alleged he used a juvenile victim’s identification, image and likeness to contact adult males on Facebook.

According to a release, Stavris used the fake Facebook profile to pose as a juvenile girl and made defamatory and derogatory comments about members of the victim’s family.

Stavris was offered a plea deal by state prosecutors Thursday to resolve his violation of probation charge and new charges of felony child abuse.

He will return to prison for five years, with credit for time served, and spend an additional 10 years behind bars on the new charges, deputies said.

“We consider this resolution a success and I’m glad to see that Stavris will go back to prison for a long time,” Sheriff Rick Staly said. “This defendant has been preying on juveniles and women since 2011 and didn’t learn his lesson even after spending nearly three years in prison the first time, so it’s time to go back where he can’t prey on children. This was a combined effort between the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office, the Florida Department of Probation, the 7th Circuit State Attorney’s Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.”

After his release, Stavris must also complete five years of sex offender probation, which includes no internet, no social media, no volunteer work around children and no contact with his victims.

387,Live like Darian: What if one teen's simple acts of kindness could change the world?,"Darian Locklear will be remembered as many things: bright, warm, kind, athletic and beautiful. But she was shy, too. Or as her mother phrased it with a laugh, “just a little socially awkward.” Even as a teenager, Darian was uncomfortable doing things like ordering at a restaurant.

And that’s why, following Darian’s death -- the 16-year-old from Metro Detroit was killed in a car crash on Feb. 6, 2018, en route to hockey practice with a friend -- Darian’s mother, Regina Locklear, was more than a little surprised when other teenagers started coming forward, contacting her with stories and fond memories to share about their beloved confidant and classmate.

The stories

The first girl who got in touch with Regina wanted to share an emotional experience about a particularly vulnerable time in her life: Years ago, the girl said, she had been ousted by her inner circle in middle school. She went from a large group of friends to no friends, and the only person who would talk to her, was Darian.

Regina was incredibly touched. She had no idea.

When Regina posted some of these details on her Facebook page -- with the girl’s blessing, of course -- a similar story surfaced, this time, via text message.

Regina received a message from a man she used to work with about 25 years ago, saying his daughter goes to the same high school that Darian attended, and apparently, the two girls knew one another.

About two weeks before Darian died, as the story goes, the man found a suicide note in his daughter’s bedroom. The family knew the teen was being bullied, but they didn’t know it was happening to such a serious extent. When they called a family meeting to talk about it, the girl confirmed that yes: “things had gotten bad enough to where she didn’t want to be here anymore,” as Regina said.

But one of the reasons the teen survived this tumultuous period, was thanks to Darian, the girl’s dad said to Regina.

“The girls didn’t even hang out outside of (school),” Regina said. “(But Darian) took her in and helped her. She coached and kind of mentored her through it. Darian never mentioned any of this.”

And then in another chance encounter, another former co-worker of Regina’s started chatting with the boy behind the counter at a local pizza restaurant, when it came up -- in a rather roundabout way -- that they were both familiar with the Locklear family.

When Darian’s name was mentioned, the boy lit up, recalling how when he was in the fourth or fifth grade, he’d sometimes sit at a lunch table by himself. But whenever that would happen, he said, Darian would get all her friends to come over, and they’d join him.

Fast-forward to today, the same young man now attends church regularly with the Locklears, after Regina came up to the pizza shop to meet him. He was even baptized this past February, and he’d never been a regular churchgoer before.

There was another teen who told Regina she had been sexually assaulted by a boy from school, and when she came forward, no one believed her, not even her friends. Darian was the only person at school who would talk to her, and she was forever grateful for that compassion. Darian’s kindness had gotten her through a very dark time.

The stories like these are plentiful.

Darian didn’t become best friends with everyone she encountered, but she was kind -- every day. She listened to people. And she touched people, in ways that her family might have never known about otherwise.

A mother's love, a mother's faith

To talk to Regina is to talk to a survivor. Although she says the family is doing OK these days, you can sometimes hear the grief in her voice, like a bumpy road she’s still trying to figure out how to navigate.

It’s more than understandable.

After all, it’s only been a little more than a year that she’s had to learn how to live without her only daughter.

“I mean, we’re able get out of bed every day,” Regina said. “We’re at peace. Peace is an OK work to use. We have our moments and our days when it’s difficult. But we have that outlook where you have to pick yourself up and keep going.”

Regina wrote about her experience, of opening her door and standing face to face with two state troopers, as they delivered the news that Darian had passed.

“It was 10 o’clock at night, and they asked if they could come in,” Regina wrote. “They then asked if Darian Locklear was our daughter. The last thing I recall them saying was, ‘She was in an accident, and I’m sorry, but she didn’t make it.’ I literally crumbled to the floor screaming, ‘NO!’ And then I just remember screaming, ‘Oh my God, what do I do? I don’t know what to do.’ Over and over and over again. My head was spinning. This could not be happening. To us. To HER … But it was. In the days to come, we would plan the funeral and bury our youngest child, our precious daughter, Darian. … We stumbled around like zombies for months. I don’t know how I got out of bed in the days following the accident. I wasn’t sure how I would go on without her. It was my worst nightmare -- the thing I prayed about every night. ‘God, please keep my kids safe and healthy.’”

In the wake of the accident, in trying to make sense of everything -- how this could have happened, the grief, how the family would move on -- the Locklears leaned on their faith. As Regina put it, she and her husband had always been believers, but life kind of got in the way, as it does sometimes.

“Darian played hockey, my son played hockey, we both worked and we were unbelievably busy,” Regina said. “We barely had time for dinner together.”

But in their time of need, the day after the accident, Regina’s sister-in-law, who’s very strong in her faith, came over to the Locklear home, accompanied by the pastors from her church.

Regina recalls sitting with everyone on the family’s living room floor when she became fixated on one thing in particular.

“My biggest concern, or worry, other than, ‘How am I going to survive this?’ is, I wanted to know (Darian’s) soul was in heaven,” Regina said.

The group talked it over, about how Darian had attended Spring Hill, a Christian camp in Northern Michigan, when she was 11 or 12, and how she’d been exposed to a Christian upbringing, even if the family didn't attend church regularly.

“It was easy to convince me, or all of us, that she was in a good place, and that she was with Jesus,” Regina said. “That perspective really made me want to be closer to God and Jesus, because then I’d be closer to her.”

People had been sending books to the family about losing a child, or how to cope with unimaginable grief. Regina said she probably read 15 of them in about two months. She was desperate for answers, and she needed to know why. Why did this happen?

So the family started attending church every week. At one point, their group swelled to about 20 to 25 people, and it felt good, she said.

“Every weekend, there’d be a connection and something we could relate to,” Regina said. “We left feeling uplifted. I don’t know how we survived those first few months. It’s a big blur.”

Regina returned to her job after only two weeks, and said she walked around like a zombie for probably four to six months. She had to give a big presentation about a month after Darian’s death, and apparently, it went really well, according to her former co-workers.

“I don’t even remember it,” Regina said. “I’m not superhuman or an ice princess. I just have to believe that it’s God giving me, and us, the strength.”

The bracelets

As time went on, Regina and other loved ones decided to do “a modest little thing” to honor Darian and keep her memory alive, as Regina put it.

Those quiet acts of kindness from Darian really seemed to resonate with people.

So the group had rubber bracelets made, with one side reading, “Kindness is beautiful” and the other side displaying the words “Fly high, Darian.”

Regina said she, along with others, handed the bracelets out to Darian’s friends at first, and they were tasked with giving out a bracelet to anyone caught performing a kind act, along with an extra one, to help spread the positive message.

Within hours, the teens had distributed all the bracelets, and they started posting photos to social media. From there, the concept took off. Regina’s first order of 300 bracelets was gone in a matter of days.

They’ve since been mailed across the country, to states including Colorado, Oregon, New York, South Carolina, Texas and Arizona. People really do want to live like Darian.

It’s often teachers and principals who’ve read Darian's story online or who have seen the social media posts, who want the bracelets for their own communities.

Maybe the group was on to something.

A community to lean on

Regina’s former company, Cooper Standard Automotive, wanted to do something special following Darian’s death, so it organized the construction of a playground in her honor, which was built at a shelter for women and children who have lived through domestic violence.

A fundraising account attached to the funeral website raised about $40,000, and the company matched that number. About 35 people -- some family and friends, and some employees -- built the playground in a single day, braving “every kind of weather you could imagine.” It was therapeutic, in a way.

From there, Darian’s loved ones continued full speed ahead, keeping busy with various fundraisers to promote her message of kindness.

At one 5K event, “Darian’s Kindness Warriors” gathered more than 100 participants and raised more than $14,000 in a matter of weeks.

Now, in fact, this coming weekend, there’s Dash for Darian -- a 5K for Kindness, which will raise money for the Darian Locklear Kindness Scholarship.

And that’s not to mention a three-on-three hockey tournament, a Skate for Darian event and several other good causes. The funds raised go toward the aforementioned kindness scholarship, which will soon be awarded to one or two students who’ve proven that they “live kindness” every day.

There’s another scholarship as well, intended for girls in Michigan who want to play hockey but struggle to afford the expensive sport. This year, five girls received about $13,000 to put toward expenses.

Darian played hockey starting at the age of 7, first with the boys, then with the girls in an AAA league. She went on to win three state championships and even a national championship.

The kindness talks

As for Regina, these days, she’s still adjusting to her “new normal.” It helps to stay busy with “kindness talks,” as they’re called. They started last spring because of a fourth-grade teacher who told her students all about Darian, and the children were enthralled by her, as Regina said. They all wrote essays about what it means to be kind, the teacher recorded them, and then at the end, they all yelled, “Fly high, Darian!”

The teacher reached out to Regina and explained how much it would mean to the kids if she paid the classroom a visit.

So she went. The students wanted to know all about her daughter -- all her favorites, and they wanted to hear exactly what she was like.

This school year, Regina is back at it, spreading Darian’s kindness, and explaining to the children how little daily acts can add up to make a big difference.

Online: The Darian Locklear Project

“I try to be interactive with the kids, and get them to talk about times when they’ve been kind,” Regina said. “It’s evolved now. I have a kindness quiz. It gets them to talk. We say like, ‘Have any of you ever been bullied? Have you witnessed it? Have you stepped in?’ They’re so into it. A handful of kids already had their Darian bracelets. They were bragging about how they got them.”

Darian's memory

Like most parents, Regina loves to talk about her kids. You can tell they're the light of her life. She has a son, too, who’s now in his second year of college, studying at the University of Michigan. Trever is 20. Darian would have been a high school senior this year. You can tell how proud Regina is, of both of her kids.

Some people don’t know how to broach the subject of Darian’s passing, Regina said, adding that sometimes, it can be awkward or “weird” when it’s clearly the elephant in the room, but no one should be scared to bring her up. It’s not as if Regina will somehow forget, and you’ll be the one to remind her.

She loves sharing stories about her sweet girl.

And speaking of stories, Regina has one more, or at least, that’s what she promised during this interview, with a laugh. It's a good one.

“When my son was a senior in high school, we still weren’t (attending church regularly),” Regina said, diving in. “But I wanted my kids to get baptized, and my son said, ‘Why would I get baptized? I don’t even know if I believe in God.’”

Regina and her husband were dumbfounded. They didn't know he felt that way.

“He came to church willingly,” Regina said. “He didn’t say much, but apparently, he wasn’t buying into it. We were devastated, like, ‘What do you mean, you don’t believe?’”

Trever was 17 years old at the time.

As Regina tells it, they eventually moved on. Life went on.

But then came the week of Darian’s funeral, and leading up to the service, the Locklears were trying to pick a song to play. They were struggling to come up with one.

Eventually, Trever found something online: “Believe,” by Brooks & Dunn. He showed it to his mom, who hadn’t forgotten their previous serious conversation about faith.

Regina listened to the lyrics carefully, and finally asked, “Does this mean you believe?” It seemed that that's perhaps what Trever was implying, but she didn't want to assume.

But the song clearly had an impact on him, and Regina could see that.

“He turned up and his eyes were full of tears,” she said. “And he said, ‘Mom, I just have to believe I’m going to see her again.’”

A wave of relief washed over Regina’s body.

“(Now) he’s a super strong believer. It was a 100% turnaround, all because he wants to see his sister again. Whatever the motivation is, that’s OK. He does believe that his sister died to save his soul, and a lot of other souls. A lot of people have come to (their faith) that never would have, ever, if this hadn’t have happened. She is an angel for so many people.”

The story of a girl

Everyone should have five minutes to chat with Regina. In her, you might hear your own mom, a friend or an aunt. You might hear yourself. It doesn’t take long to figure out where Darian must have learned how to be so kind and warm.

Regina spoke about how others have had to deal with unimaginable losses too, and she knows her family isn’t alone. They're not the only ones who've had to navigate unbelievable grief. Even in the accident, Darian wasn’t the only one in the car that day. Julianna Ward-Brown, a fellow high school junior, was also killed. She’s survived by just as many loved ones.

But for today, this is Darian’s story: about how the kindness of one girl has the potential to spread worldwide. About one family, saved by their faith.

The kindness message is simple, but it resonates with people.

“This was not something I would have ever expected from her,” Regina said. “We never knew she was that person who’d be there for all those girls.

“Yes, our lives are 100% different from what they were before. We are not the same people. (Darian’s passing) was life-changing. Of course, I’d choose to have my daughter back 100,000%, but at least there’s some good that’s come out of it.”

390,Clarice the tiny antelope born at Brevard Zoo,"- An adorable antelope was born at the Brevard Zoo in April.

The Brevard Zoo announced on Wednesday that three-year-old klipspringer Deborah gave birth to a calf on April 15th. The female calf, now named Clarice, weighed less than two pounds at birth and is properly nursing.

“This adorable little girl is doing wonderfully,” said Michelle Smurl, the Zoo’s director of animal programs, “Deborah is taking great care of her, grooming her often.”

The newborn, who the zoo said was sired by four-year-old Ajabu, is still behind the scenes with her mother and will be introduced to Ajabu before going into the public-facing habitat in Expedition Africa.

Klipspringers are small antelopes typically found around mountains, hills, and rocky outcrops in native Africa. They are skilled climbers bcause of their specialized hooves that are about the diameter of a dime as an adult. They are sexually mature at one year and can live up 18 years in human care. Their gestation period is typically between six to seven months.The klipspringer does not face any major threats, but they are sometimes hunted for use as meat or leather.

A former school bus driver who pleaded guilty to raping a 14-year-old girl will not receive any prison time, according to the sentence handed down by a New York State Supreme Court judge.The victim was 14 when she was she assaulted by Shane Piche on June 10, 2018, outside the upstate New York city of Watertown, Jefferson County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Patricia Dziuba told CNN Tuesday. Piche is 25, according to CNN affiliate WWNY.Piche waived indictment in February and was sentenced last Thursday to probation for 10 years. According to the certificate of disposition, he must register as a Level 1 sex offender and pay fees of $1,425. He pleaded guilty to third-degree rape.The New York sex offender website describes Level 1 as an offender with a ""low risk of re-offense."" Piche's address would not be listed on the registry, just his zip code.Piche met the victim while driving her bus and ""maintained communication"" with her on social media, Dziuba said. That led to him inviting her to his home, plying her with alcohol, and then raping her, according to the prosecutor.Prosecutors originally asked for a ""split to probation,"" which is a mix of jail time and up to 10 years' probation, Dziuba said. Although they could have asked for up to four years of prison, prosecutors wanted Piche to better learn how to control his urges and to learn proper boundaries, she said.Prosecutors were looking for treatment for Piche, according to Dziuba, who said Piche will receive sex offender counseling and treatment while on probation. The state also wanted to protect the victim from court proceedings, she added.In a victim impact statement, the girl's mother wrote: ""I wish Shane Piche would have received time in jail for the harm he caused to my child. He took something from my daughter she will never get back and has caused her to struggle with depression and anxiety.""Piche will have to report locally to the sheriff's department in the county where he lives, and he will not have access to children or live within a certain distance to children, the prosecutor said.The pre-sentencing report -- which considers the defendant's past, input from the victim and the victim's family, the facts of the case and other factors -- determined probation was the appropriate punishment, Dziuba said. The ultimate decision on the sentence rested with the judge, she said.Dziuba said the case was not a violent sexual assault but was prosecuted as third-degree rape because it is considered an age-based crime in New York. Third-degree rape also allows for unconditional discharge where a defendant is fined and sent on his way.Dziuba said she was not present for victim impact statements in court last week.Piche's attorney, Eric Swartz, said in a statement that his client ""cannot be alone with anyone under the age of seventeen, with the exception of friends and relatives as reported and agreed by the probation department.""""He'll be a felon for the rest of his life,"" Swartz said in an interview with WWNY. ""He's on the sex offender registry for a long time. Maybe not the rest of his life because of the level, but this isn't something that didn't cause him pain, and this isn't something that didn't have consequences.""Piche was employed as a bus driver for the Watertown City School District in Jefferson County.Watertown City Schools Superintendent Patti LaBarre told CNN, ""The district cannot comment on personnel matters regarding outside contracted employees.""",https://www.wpbf.com/article/no-jail-time-for-school-bus-driver-who-admitted-to-raping-14-year-old-he-met-on-his-route/27331324,2019-05-01T14:12:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
395,President of Basecamp Ventures withdraws application for Camp McConnell,"A couple weeks after past accusations of an inappropriate relationship with a student came to light, the president of the company slotted to run a children’s camp on a Micanopy property has withdrawn his application, according to county officials.

Jordan A. Richmond pulled his nonprofit Basecamp Ventures from consideration to run a year-round outdoor education camp on the 212-acre Camp McConnell.

County spokesman Mark Sexton said Alachua County officials will now negotiate with the board of commissioners' second choice to run the camp, Friendship Circle of North Broward and South Palm Beach Inc. The Parkland organization hosts programs for special needs children.

According to Sexton, Richmond withdrew the application to the county attorney’s office on Monday in a phone call, and gave no reason for his decision.

The withdrawal comes two weeks after The Sun reported that Richmond lost his job following a Marion County School District investigation of an inappropriate relationship with one of his students. Richmond was a drama teacher at West Port High School.

The Sun also found Tuesday that some of the people listed as Basecamp's board of directors did not know they were on the board.

At least two of the nine people listed as board members said they never agreed to be on the board.

Gerry Dedenbach, vice president of CHW Professional Consultants, said he had no knowledge of being a board member. He added that though he discussed the possibility of joining with Richmond in the past, he never officially accepted.

Kathleen Schofield, executive director of Northeast Florida Regional STEM2 Hub, said though she worked with Richmond on camps around four or five years ago, she also never officially agreed to be a board member.

Schofield said she was unaware of the accusations against Richmond until told by a reporter Tuesday. She said she informed Richmond she would no longer consider being on the board.

“I find it shocking,” she said. “I will not have an official role with that organization.”

Board member Richard Meachum, of Under the Son Outfitters, said he still stands with Richmond.

“He’s definitely a friend,” he said. “It’s sad to see what’s been said.”

Meachum said the accusations are just “accusations,” and does not foresee leaving the company.

Other board members could not be reached Tuesday.

Witnesses in the Marion County schools investigation said Richmond and the 11th-grade girl were often seen together, including in his office with the door shut. One student said the girl wore his wedding band.

An Ocala police report says the two were found in a minivan behind an abandoned car dealership on a Sunday night in 2016. In the report, the girl told police she asked Richmond to meet in a private location, and she later appeared to be crying and discussing family issues.

In Florida Department of Education records obtained by the county on Monday, a student in the investigation said Richmond sent out a tweet with the numbers 3, 15 and 17 with the caption: “that’s something to think about.” The student said she discovered the numbers were linked to the girl’s 18th birthday.

Richmond denied the post was about the girl's birthday, saying the numbers represented his parents' anniversary date. Investigators later found this was not true through his parents' Facebook, and confirmed the numbers matched the girl's birthday.

Students also said Richmond liked and retweeted the girl’s social media posts that included photos of her wearing a bikini.

Though Richmond was never arrested or charged in the incident, he later lost his teaching job.

Since then, he has been eyeing the Camp McConnell property for his company, which The Sun previously reported had ties to Sen. Keith Perry, R-Gainesville.

Perry threatened to sue the county in 2017 if the county did not allow him buy the land. Though he didn't, his Gainesville roofing company was found in February to have the same address as another now-dissolved company, also called Basecamp Ventures. Perry said he was only involved in advising Richmond about a business plan.

Last week, Perry said he still supports Richmond despite the investigation, saying accusations should be taken seriously but those working closely with kids can sometimes be viewed negatively.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190430/president-of-basecamp-ventures-withdraws-application-for-camp-mcconnell?rssfeed=true,2019-04-30T17:29:27Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
396,"5-year-old girl on life support after sister, 2, killed in I-95 crash","DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. - A 5-year-old girl remains on life support Monday, a day after her 2-year-old sister was killed in a car crash along Interstate 95 in northern Broward County, her parents confirmed to Local 10 News.

Keanna and Akeena's father told Local 10 News reporter Trent Kelly that his daughters were in a car being driven by their godmother when the crash occurred.

Battalion Chief Michael Kane, a spokesman for Broward Sheriff's Office Department of Fire Rescue, said two cars collided just before 11 a.m. Sunday in the southbound lanes of I-95, north of Sample Road. One the vehicles also struck a barrier wall, Kane said.

Lt. Alvaro Feola, a spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said the children were not in car seats. According to the crash report, it's unclear, however, whether the sisters were wearing seat belts.

The crash prompted authorities to shut down several lanes of the highway for more than six hours.

Paramedics took the children to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, where Akeena later died.

The children's father told Kelly that he and his wife are staying by Keanna’s side in the hospital, praying for a miracle.

A man, Zachary Schott, and a woman, Raby Rashida, 34, of Deerfield Beach, were also hurt in the crash. Rashida was taken to Broward Health Medical Center, while Schott was treated at the scene. Both of their injuries were not life-threatening, authorities said.

The FHP is investigating the cause of the crash.

A GoFundMe page has been created to help the children's family during their time of need.

398,Central Florida man sought in triple homicide turns himself in,"HAINES CITY, Fla. - A Central Florida man accused of killing two women and a 6-year-old girl turned himself in to the Haines City Police Department on Sunday after being on the run for almost two days.

Police said Ernst Cherizard, 38, killed his girlfriend, 23-year-old Eli Normil, and fatally wounded her daughter, Elizabelle Frenel, late Friday at an apartment complex in Haines City. When Normil's aunt, 48-year-old Nicole Guillume went to check on her niece, Guillume was shot and killed as well.

Paramedics rushed Elizabelle to a local hospital by helicopter, where she was declared brain dead and put on life support. She died of her injuries hours later.

Police said Cherizard fled the scene and officers launched a statewide search for him. Early Saturday, a toll booth in Boynton Beach recorded the plate of Cherizard's 2011 Nissan Altima early Saturday.

Early Saturday, someone posted to Cherizard's Facebook account and apologized to his children. ""Daddy is so sorry with all my heart cuz I can't believe this happened,"" the post read in part.

Elensky called Cherizard a ""monster"" and said Elizabelle was shot multiple times.

""Because of Cherizard's cowardly actions -- and they are nothing short of cowardly -- a family now has to bury three members, including a young child who had her whole life in front of her,"" Haines City police Chief Jim Elensky said

401,Woman who lost legs in explosion remembers 'miracle',"FORT LAUDERDALE — After a tourist boat exploded beneath Stefanie Schaffer's seat, mangling her legs, she lay in a hospital bed wondering whether she would ever walk again. But before she surrendered to despair, her doctors unknowingly inspired her.

""Every day when the trauma team would do their rounds, I would hear them outside my door,"" said Schaffer, 22, about her stay at Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale. ""And they'd say, 'The girl in this room is a miracle.' And it just made me feel grateful to be alive for a couple of minutes each day.""

On the back of the Rutland, Vt. college student's left arm is a tattoo.

""Miracle,"" it says.

On June 30, Schaffer, her mother Stacey Bender, 51, stepfather Paul Bender, 56, and sister Brooke Schaffer, 13, were vacationing in Exuma, in the Bahamas. They were in a tour boat on their way to see pigs that swim in the sea.

But, ""five minutes into it, the boat exploded right under my seat,"" Schaffer said. ""Both of my legs were broken beyond repair,"" leading to amputations below her knees.

Her other injuries included compound fractures of her left arm and right wrist; a broken left femur; broken pelvic bones; a broken back and lacerations to her kidneys, liver and spleen. Both her lungs had filled with blood. And she underwent dialysis for three months.

Her family was also hurt in the explosion that day.

Stacy Bender had a broken left leg and right ankle; fractured right wrist, broken ribs, a collapsed lung and internal injuries similar to Stefanie's but not as severe, she said.

Brooke Schaffer was knocked out for a little while and Paul Bender was thrown to the front of the boat; the back of his head was cut open, requiring stitches.

Also aboard the boat was Maleka Grimes Jackson of Tennessee, who was killed in the explosion. Her husband Tyran Jackson survived, and like Schaffer and her family, was flown to South Florida and treated at a Broward Health hospital.

Recently, at the end of the Schaffer-Bender family's weeklong vacation in Key Largo, they stopped at Broward Health in Fort Lauderdale.

Stefanie Schaffer wanted to ""meet the doctors that had really saved my life that I wasn't really conscious to meet. My parents got to know them but I never really got the chance to thank them. I really just wanted to show them what they've given me the opportunity to achieve.

""Because without them, I wouldn't be here,"" she said.

Some of Schaffer's former caregivers, including nurse Rafael Toloza, who has a daughter the same age as Schaffer, and Dr. Christopher Roberts, a neurosurgeon, were brought to tears at the sight of her.

Roberts had performed a fusion procedure on Schaffer's spine, and also took away bone fragments from the lower portion of her spinal cord, which is stabilized with titanium rods and screws.

He greeted her with a hug and a warning not to go snowboarding just yet.

""But we'll get there,"" Roberts told her.

""A lot of times we fix patients and that's it,"" he said. ""Occasionally you'll get a card from another state or another country. But to actually see someone that you touched like this and walking like that, nobody warned me about that. It was a hell of a surprise.""

Her doctors' confidence in Schaffer's recovery, which seemed long and far away for her battered body during those six weeks last summer, helped her to power through another 16 weeks of treatment in two different Boston hospitals.

In all, she has had more than 25 surgeries, and still has 20 doctors who are helping with everything from scar management to physical therapy and pain from the prostheses that she began walking with in November, her parents said.

While in treatment in Boston, Schaffer was visited by survivors of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, in which three people were killed and more than 200 injured. Some of those amputees taught her to look to the future.

""All the time I thought (why me?) in the beginning,"" Schaffer said. ""But one of the Boston bombing victims said when you go through something like this, you can't just keep thinking 'why did this happen?' and 'why me?' because then you're just stuck in it. So I tried to stop asking that question.""

Schaffer doesn't hide her artificial limbs or evidence of her injuries. And for the hospital visit, she chose a short sundress and cute sandals to wear. The toes of her prosthetic feet were painted a light blue — because they were boring before, she said.

""When I first got hurt, I thought I would never be able to show my prosthetics,"" Schaffer said. ""I thought I would never wear shorts again, never wear a bathing suit again, never wear a dress again.""

When she was a patient at Broward Health last summer, ""even if it was 85 degrees out I would cover myself with blankets and I'd go sweat outside and I would refuse to take it off.

""But now, I mean I'm in a dress showing my prosthetics,"" she said. ""I think realizing how much work it takes (to walk with them) makes me more proud to wear them. So people can just understand maybe what I've gone through a little bit. I'm just not embarrassed by it anymore.""

For the pretty, petite brunette, what others may think of her appearance is no longer important.

""Even before I got the prosthetics, I would go around with no legs and covered in scars,"" Schaffer said. ""I knew people were staring but it just didn't really bother me anymore. And that would have just killed me before the accident.""

As Schaffer masters using her new legs, she said she is realizing how hard it is to do.

""I can't feel the ground when I am walking,"" she said. Where her legs meet the devices, there is pain and the skin breaks down. There are fitting issues, and she has phantom limb pain. And her back hurts if she spends too much time in her wheelchair.

""Your whole body has to be strong just to stand up,"" Schaffer said. ""When I first started I couldn't hold myself up, even with parallel bars and a harness. Now I can hold myself up without holding on to anything. But that took a long time.""

Schaffer wants to finish her final year at Castleton University in Vermont, where she is majoring in public health. She wants to earn a master's degree in the same subject, and eventually work with people who have disabilities.

She isn't dating, and said, ""I never really dated before the accident, either. It's a possibility. We'll see.""

Learning to drive with hand controls is also on her to do list.

To those who survive life-altering injuries that require extensive rehabilitation, she said, ""The most important part is to stay motivated. Even when it feels like it's not gonna get any better.

""The medical staff can do their part, but the rest is on you,"" she said. ""And you have to keep going to therapy and you have to keep pushing yourself hard. Because if you don't, you never know where you're gonna get to.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190505/woman-who-lost-legs-in-explosion-remembers-miracle?rssfeed=true,2019-05-05T16:19:58Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
404,Housing elderly sex offenders,"""Nobody wants him,"" she said. ""Nobody wants a sex offender.""

TALLAHASSEE — Since 82-year-old Leonard Bailey hit his head in a fall eight months ago, he can't remember to take his medicine.

His ex-wife, Marianne Devita, calls him 11 times a day to remind him about his appointments.

At that stage of dementia, many families would consider admitting him to a nursing home, but Devita said she has a list of assisted living homes that have rejected Bailey. The pages lined up are as tall as Devita's grandson — whom Bailey has never seen.

""Nobody wants him,"" she said. ""Nobody wants a sex offender.""

Bailey is among a growing number of elderly sex offenders: People on Florida's list of 73,000 registered offenders who are 65 and older jumped 2 percentage points between 2015 and 2016, according to the state's legislative auditors, the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability. Florida's registry has about 10,200 elderly offenders.

The problem is sparking a national crisis of social and justice policy: How and where do we allow the most-reviled class of citizens to survive their silver years - especially those with serious age-related medical problems - after they have served their prison terms, while striving to protect children who may be living nearby?

For offenders like Bailey who can't live without assistance, nursing or retirement homes are not a guarantee. Even if the retirement home isn't within 1,000 feet of schools and parks, as required the state's sex offender residency restrictions, managers of nursing homes often reject elderly felons.

The state policy for long-term care homes is this: Management can choose to accept or reject applicants. Some other states, and Hillsborough County, have residency restrictions within 1,000 feet of places where seniors live, including nursing homes. States, counties and cities have different rules limiting where offenders can live.

In Iowa, the 2017 legislature considered a bill that would have created a committee that studied the feasibility of building a long-term care facility for offenders.

Privately owned assisted living homes have reasons for rejecting offenders. They may be financially responsible for lawsuits if a resident is assaulted by another resident with a criminal history. A Pennsylvania nursing home agreed to pay $6.75 million in damages to the estate of a resident who was assaulted there. The home knew the resident who assaulted her was a registered offender.

Oak Hammock, a University of Florida-managed retirement community in Gainesville, said it prioritizes resident safety and screens for sex-related criminal histories. It does not accept predators.

Assisted-living homes may also face reputational damage and lose other prospective clients if their commercial addresses show up on sex-offender registries.

Living at home isn't always an option for offenders either. When offenders' families are unable to move from areas near school or parks, offenders seek housing elsewhere.

Bailey was arrested for touching a minor in Florida while he was on vacation with Devita from their home in Long Island, New York.

Devita is still in New York, driving her 14-year-old grandson to school in the mornings, helping her daughter-in-law with chores. Bailey remains near where he was in prison. He is driven to court-mandated therapy and the sheriff's office.

When Bailey put a girl's hand in his pocket and asked her if she felt his ""little leg,"" he was 74. Now Devita said Bailey, who uses a cane, can't live on his own anymore. After he hit his head in the bathroom, it took her calling him 37 times before he was able to reach for the phone.

""Help me"" is all he said.

Since then, he often forgets his ""black box"" that pairs with the bracelet around his ankle to monitor his location. He's already been sent to prison for misplacing the device before and his parole officer has warned him the next time it happens he will be sent back.

Bailey can't help but forget.

""I'm getting too old to fight about this,"" he said. ""I don't care.""

For some victim advocates, any risk that a sex offender might lapse back into criminal behavior is too high. Ron Book, a former legislator, lobbied for Florida's restrictions after his daughter, who is now a state senator, was assaulted by her nanny in the late '90s and early 2000s.

He said he has met elderly offenders and is aware of cases when they committed new crimes. He does not think the state should change laws to account for the aging offender population.

""Sex crimes are sex crimes,"" he said. ""Doesn't matter if they're 18 or 98.""

Researchers have found that the chance of recidivism decreases by half every five years an offender is out of prison, said Jill Levenson, professor of social work at Barry University and an expert in sex offender treatment and policy.

She predicts that offenders will live together and provide care to each other.

This is already happening, according to sheriff's offices responses in the state's accountability office survey.

Residency restrictions are the most common hurdle for offenders searching for housing, with unwilling property managers a close second reason. Both contribute to the growth of enclave communities where offenders live together, usually in mobile home parks.

There are no known, comprehensive lists of communities or neighborhoods that accept sex offenders. Some in Florida include a St. Petersburg trailer park that was the subject of a 2016 documentary called ""Pervert Park.""

Lori Nassofer, who helps sex offenders 55 and older find housing in Central Florida, owns three mobile home parks near Orlando. ""NO CHILDREN"" signs are posted at the driveway.

The business of finding offenders housing is booming. There are no vacancies in Nassofer's parks.

Ron Johnson manages Overland Village for Nassofer, a mobile home park in Apopka. He said he receives 30 to 40 calls a week. He is kept busy coordinating housing for sex offenders recently released from prison.

Sex offenders in Florida must already have an address they will live at before they can leave prison.

""It's taking calls all the time,"" Johnson said. ""Taking phone calls, dealing with probation, prisons, release coordinators, hospitals — you name it.""

Finding housing is considered one of the biggest barriers for sex offenders recently released from prison. Federal rental assistance in public housing is not available to sex offenders.

Johnson said sex offenders risk being gouged for rent when they have no other options. At Nassofer's parks, most offenders already own their trailers or rent from each other. She charges $350 for land rent and covers utilities.

Many of the offenders have Social Security benefits, Medicare and Medicaid. Some get financial help from family or friends. Few have jobs.

Bailey receives $1,200 a month for Social Security and pays his roommate, Paul Casey, $500 for a room in his trailer.

Most of the elderly offenders in the park have relatively younger roommates who take care of them. Johnson takes care of elderly in his park, including a man in a wheelchair.

""I shouldn't have him because I can't care for him,"" he said. ""But what is he going to do?""

When Bailey's doctor told him he could no longer drive because of the dementia, Casey started using Bailey's Lincoln to take him grocery shopping.

Gail Colleta, an advocate for sex offenders, has asked lawmakers to consider lifting the state's residency restrictions if an offender is a certain age or has ailments.

""This is a humanity issue,"" said Colleta, president of Florida Action Committee. ""We're more concerned about stray animals than we are about people with issues, that need to have medication, that need to have oxygen, that are just human beings.""

Bailey has given up trying to take control. Sitting in a fold-out chair at the picnic area of his mobile home park, he pointed at the ground. He said he'd rather be under it.

""I'm just so tired of hanging around.""",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190503/housing-elderly-sex-offenders?rssfeed=true,2019-05-03T07:20:00Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
407,Crystal Lake Elementary partnering with community to help students,"“We just want to see the children thrive.” — Crystal Lake Elementary Principal Kristan Fowler

LAKELAND — The sounds of hammering could be heard Thursday coming from two portables on the Crystal Lake Elementary School campus. Workmen continue to transform the buildings into a community clinic that will be available beginning Monday to the school’s 470 students, as well as their parents, neighbors and anyone who walks through the door.

“Our target audience is the 33801 zip code,” said Andrea Hagan, director of the unique community partnership with the school. The clinic will have a doctor, nurse practitioner and dentist on staff and will take health insurance as well as payments on a sliding scale of ability to pay. “Our families were predominantly receiving health care at the emergency room, so there was not preventative care or follow-up care.”

Hagan graduated from Southeastern University with degrees in elementary education and psychology and has spent many years working for Florida Baptist Children’s Home and then Heartland for Children, one of the five core partners with the school. The others are nearby Southeastern University, United Way of Central Florida, Central Florida Health Care, all working with Polk County Public Schools on the project.

Crystal Lake was awarded the community school pilot program two years ago, with core partners signing a 25-year memorandum of understanding, promising to provide financial support, medical and social aid, along with academic enhancement for several generations. They are providing after-school tutoring and will have before-school help, along with weekend academic help at the school as they build more partnerships. The tutoring is available outside of regular school hours because all of the students live in the working-class neighborhood around the school.

It is designed to break the cycle of poverty and improve student performance, based on similar programs in Hillsborough and Orange counties.

""No one can do their best in school or at work when they are hungry, sick or in pain,"" said Christina Criser, CEO of United Way of Central Florida. ""The holistic services at the Crystal Lake Community Partnership School addresses needs for students, families, and the community at large.""

Crystal Lake Elementary Principal Kristan Fowler said there is already an impact.

“The discipline (issue) has come down,” Fowler said, noting there are fewer referrals to the office and suspensions. “I start talking about it and I get so emotional — all these opportunities for our children here.”

Fowler has more than two decades of education experience and is in her second year as a principal. She was an assistant principal at Boswell Elementary in Auburndale and has spent time teaching fifth, third and first grades.

It is difficult to nail down an exact program cost, but three positions filled this year, along with contracted services, cost about $420,000, with the George Jenkins Foundation and the Iron Horse Foundation donating through United Way. The Givewell Foundation and Publix charities have also donated funding.

In addition to Hagan, there is a health and wellness coordinator, along with a parents and family engagement coordinator.

The groups and businesses send in volunteers to read with kindergartners and help students plant and tend to a vegetable and flower garden. They also provide food and clothing to the Title I students, most of whom qualify for free or reduced cost lunches. The Girl Scouts are on campus, as is Central Florida Health Care’s Mobile Kitchen to teach families about healthy and nutritious eating. A recent partnership and pizza event saw 250 people show up.

Classes are going to be offered for parents, based on things they have said they want, including financial, job and computer training, along with English language classes because foreign-born families want to assimilate.

Fowler and Hagan said some students are dealing with more than poverty: Some have educational or learning challenges, there are behavior issues, many come from single-parent homes or abusive situations, and some routinely go hungry.

Two fifth-graders who have attended the school for several years have seen a positive change.

“I got suspended for fighting,” said 11-year-old Enrique Hernandez, explaining the punishment straightened out his behavior. “I should not fight because school is not for fighting, it’s for learning. I’ve never been back to the office.”

He was one of four students rewarded for his improved behavior and grades with VIP treatment at a recent Lakeland Magic game.

“Kindness reminds the kids that they’re special, that they can succeed,” Hagan said.

Fowler and Hagan have implemented a positive behavior program based on “houses,” like in Harry Potter books. Their houses are based on character traits and are called Courage, Perseverance, Integrity and Loyalty. They even have their own T-shirts. The house with most points at the end of the school year is getting a trip to Legoland.

Shaelynn Cox, 11, said the positive behavior program has helped her be a better student and classmate.

“I’ve gotten extra recess, ice cream,” Shaelynn said. When asked what the best part of Crystal Lake Elementary is, she said, “Getting to learn — the teachers are nice.”

As Fowler walked down a sidewalk, students darted to her side, arms outstretched for hugs. Fowler says she worries about her students even when she is not at school, adding there is one little boy whom she never sees smile.

“I just want to take him home and rock him and tell him, ‘You’re going to grow up and be somebody important,’” Fowler said. “We just want to see the children thrive.”

409,Former CCSO jail technician charged with sexually abusing two boys sentenced to state prison,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

A former Collier County Sheriff’s Office civilian jail technician accused of sexually abusing two boys pleaded no contest to the charges and was sentenced to 12 years and 9 months in state prison, according to court records.

Raul Cano Jr., 20, was fired from the sheriff’s office Feb. 4 after he was charged with three counts of lewd and lascivious molestation of boys ages 12 to 16.

Cano was older than 18 at the time of the incidents and pleaded no contest to the charges on April 1, according to court records.

He was sentenced by Collier Circuit Judge Ramiro Mañalich on April 8 and, once released from prison, will be on sex offender probation for 10 years, according to court documents.

Cano was a member of the Sheriff's Office beginning in March 2018. The charges against him were unrelated to his employment with the Sheriff’s Office, according to the agency.

Cano will get credit for three days of time served at the Naples Jail Center and will have to pay $100 for the cost of prosecution, $1,195 for the cost of investigation and $868 in court costs.

In Cano’s arrest report, a detective with the sheriff's office wrote he conducted interviews at the Children's Advocacy Center of Collier County after two teens told a third party that Cano molested them.

The first teen, whose age was redacted in the report, said Cano picked him up, then grabbed his exposed genitals while driving him home in February 2018, according to the arrest report.

Cano grabbed the teen’s exposed genitals a second time while driving him around Immokalee in June 2018, according to the report.

The second teen, whose age was also redacted, told the detective that Cano picked him up July 7, 2018, and they stayed at a residence together. The teen fell asleep on a couch and woke to Cano grabbing his genitals through his clothing, according to the report.

“This adorable little girl is doing wonderfully,” said Michelle Smurl, the Zoo’s director of animal programs. “Deborah is taking great care of her, grooming her often.”

Of the more than 900 animals representing 195 species from all over the world, this may be the cutest, although meerkat lovers may have their own opinions.

The newborn, called a ""rock star"" by zoo officials, since it lives in rocky habitats, will soon be introduced to four-year-old Ajabu, its sire, before transitioning into the public-facing habitat in Expedition Africa within a matter of weeks.

After a gestation period of six to seven months, klipspringer typically give birth to one offspring.

According to the zoo, they are sexually mature at one year and can live up to 18 years in human care. With specialized hooves each roughly the diameter of a dime as an adult, the klipspringer is a skilled climber; it is typically found around mountains, hills and rocky outcrops in its native Africa.

An antelope is more closely related to sheep and cattle rather than deer, which it sort of resembles, according to Zirulnik. Also, antelope have horns, which they don't shed, and deer have antlers, which they shed every year.

A klipspringer (Afrikans for cliff jumper) is a herbivore, which means its eats grass, vegetables and even flowers in Africa, but primarily will eat hay at the zoo.

The klipspringer does not face any major threats, but it is sometimes hunted for use as meat or leather.

411,Softball: North Fort Myers grad Natavia Ellis makes smooth transition to college game at FSW,"CLOSE North Fort Myers graduate Natavia Ellis hasn't had problems adjusting to college softball with top-ranked Florida SouthWestern Andrew Sodergren, andy.sodergren@naplesnews.com, 239-263-4731

When Florida SouthWestern softball coach Robert Iamurri recruited Natavia Ellis, he saw great potential in the former North Fort Myers star.

Ellis was a .440 career hitter with 28 doubles, 15 triples, 10 homers and 119 RBIs in her four years with the Red Knights.

And while Iamurri knew she was a promising prospect, even he’s a little surprised with how quickly she’s adjusted to the college game.

“We’ve had some local kids in the program, some good kids, but she’s the first local girl we’ve had that’s truly become dominant,” Iamurri said. “She’s just a strong hitter, and we felt she had that potential and she’s lived up to that potential. You never truly know how a recruit is going to adjust to college pitching. Sometimes they never quite catch up or at the very least, it takes them a year to catch up.”

Ellis parlayed an outstanding fall campaign into a starting position at first base, where she’s batted anywhere from cleanup to eighth. The top-ranked Bucs (54-1) are stacked offensively, hitting .401 with a .600 slugging percentage as a team. Ellis is hitting .398 with a .453 on-base percentage and a .617 slugging mark. She ranks second on the team with seven homers and tied for third with 47 RBIs.

The Buccaneers begin their quest for a national championship Thursday, facing Seminole State in the first round of the FCSAA state tournament in Sanford.

“In the fall, we weren’t jelling like we should have,” Ellis said. “But when spring came, we’ve just been so good together. We’ve worked together so well, everyone gets along. It’s been a great time.”

Ellis says the coaching staff, which also includes assistants Kellie Quarles and Ryan Iamurri – Robert’s daughter who played for him at Naples High and later at the University of Alabama – has been instrumental in her successful transition to college ball.

“(Coach Iamurri) is a great guy and knows so much of the game, it’s really fun playing for him,” she said. “All the coaches are great, helping me learn new things with my swing that I didn’t really know before. And it’s brought out the best in me.”

The Bucs’ starting lineup can strike fear into opposing pitchers, and the pitchers have delivered a 1.25 team earned run average. And while it’s no wonder how the Bucs have dominated the opposition, FSW knows it faces a tall task at the state tournament.

Five of the top 20 teams in the National Junior College Athletic Association Division I poll are in the tournament, including three of the top four – No. 1 FSW, No. 3 Chipola and No. 4 College of Central Florida. Seminole State, the Bucs’ first-round opponent, is ranked 17th. The top two teams in the double-elimination tournament advance to the NJCAA Division I softball championship tournament, held May 22-25 in St. Georges, Utah.

“This is an incredibly difficult region to come out of,” Iamurri said. “We’ve got three of the top four teams in the nation here, and at least one of those teams isn’t going to advance. Five of the eight teams in this tournament are nationally ranked, so we need to play our best softball of the season to keep going.”",http://rssfeeds.news-press.com/~/601479728/0/ftmyers/home~Softball-North-Fort-Myers-grad-Natavia-Ellis-makes-smooth-transition-to-college-game-at-FSW/,2019-05-01T10:24:03Z,The News-Press,Couple,"2442 Dr Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Fort Myers, FL 33901, USA",FL,33901
412,Ex-Oak View Middle teacher gets 10 years for child sex trafficking,"Jeffrey Farrell Davis, 36, must also serve 25 years of supervised release.

A former Oak View Middle School teacher was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison on a conviction for child sex trafficking.

Jeffrey Farrell Davis, 36, must also serve 25 years of supervised release, pay $3,000 in restitution to the victim and pay a $5,000 special assessment, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

Davis in 2017 was charged with child sex trafficking and using a minor to produce child pornography. In March 2018 he pleaded guilty to child sex trafficking.

FBI Special Agent Brannon Baxter wrote in a sworn affidavit that an employee of the Partnership for Strong Families obtained information that a 14-year-old girl had been involved with two adult men who advertised her and took her to various North Central Florida locations to be sold for sex.

The men posted advertisements for sex with the girl on the Backpage.com website for the Gainesville area. Customers responded by text to a number in the ad to make arrangements. The girl would then be taken to various locations including homes and motels.

She identified customers and described a number of locations where she was involved in commercial sex, the affidavit said. One of them was a person who lived near the Alliance Credit Union. She described him as “the camera guy.”

The victim told officials she went to his apartment several times and that he made videos and photos of his sexual activity with her using multiple small cameras on tripods and a cellphone.

Shown a photo lineup of tenants of the apartment, the girl pointed out Davis as the “camera guy,” according to the federal complaint. Authorities said Davis acknowledged the sexual activity but said he thought the girl was 19, as advertised.

The man suspected of killing his parents and five other people in two rural Tennessee homes stole the car of one of the victims and was wearing a blood-stained T-shirt when he was seen, telling acquaintances the stain was just chocolate, according to authorities and court documents.Law enforcement agents arrested 25-year-old Michael Cummins on Saturday about a mile from one of the two crime scenes at separate homes in rural Sumner County. He was shot and wounded while being taken into custody after authorities spotted him in a creek bed.Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director David Rausch called the two crime scenes “horrific” and “gruesome.” He didn’t elaborate on the manner in which the victims died, but said the attacks are believed to have taken place over more than one day.Rausch’s agency, also known as the TBI, identified the dead as the man’s parents, 51-year-old David Carl Cummins and 44-year-old Clara Jane Cummins; 45-year-old uncle Charles Edward Hosale; 43-year-old Rachel Dawn McGlothlin-Pee, whose relationship to Cummins wasn’t clear; Rachel’s 12-year-old daughter, Sapphire McGlothlin-Pee; and Rachel’s mother, 64-year-old Marsha Elizabeth Nuckols. Another victim, 69-year-old Shirley B. Fehrle, was found in a separate home and has no known relationship to Cummins.An eighth victim, another relative, remained hospitalized in critical condition.Cummins has a lengthy criminal record and had multiple court-ordered requests in the past to undergo mental health checks.A court filing Monday said Cummins was in violation of his probation, which stemmed from a conviction for attempted aggravated arson and aggravated assault in which in September 2017, he set his neighbor’s home on fire while she was inside and shoved her and pulled her hair while he was holding a gun, court documents show.At the time of his 2017 arrest, he said that “if I get out of jail, I’ll go down there and do it again,” and later, when authorities asked about that statement, said that “when I get out, I’ll finish the job,” according to the documents. The neighbor was not one of the seven people named as deceased.Cummins in part violated his probation because he didn’t comply with a required mental health evaluation, one document shows. In the arson and assault case, a judge had reduced his 10-year prison sentence to 10 years of probation in January — after his conviction in July — on the condition that he receive the mental health evaluation and not contact his neighbor.Cummins was released from jail in mid-January, said Ray Whitley, the local district attorney general.“This is one of the most horrific cases I’ve ever had to encounter and deal with,” said Whitley, the district attorney general in Sumner County since 1980.Cummins had entered other agreements to undergo mental health treatments previously: after he pleaded guilty to 2017 charges of misdemeanor theft and evading arrest and after he pleaded guilty to 2013 charges of violating a restraining order, TBI records show.Arrest warrants for Cummins were filed Monday on a charge of criminal homicide for at least one of the deceased and a charge of theft of property over $10,000.Authorities have said the initial discovery of four bodies and an injured person stemmed from a 911 call from a family member Saturday. The injured victim was transported to the hospital with unspecified injuries. On Sunday, according to a TBI statement, the bodies of two more victims were found at the home.Another body was found Saturday at another home in the area. Authorities believe the two scenes are related. The slayings occurred near the town of Westmoreland, not far from the Tennessee line with Kentucky.Authorities have not said what kind of weapon was used. Fehrle appeared to have “blunt force trauma to her face” and other injuries to her extremities and her car was the one stolen and found abandoned in a creek bed, the affidavit says.Additionally, Cummins told his acquaintances that the blood on his shirt was just chocolate, the affidavit says. He also told them that “if anything goes down, he would get blamed for it and was saving a bullet for himself,” the affidavit says.On Saturday, TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said at least one officer fired at Cummins after he emerged from the woods. Cummins is believed to have produced multiple weapons and the situation escalated, DeVine said.Cummins remains hospitalized for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, DeVine said.None of the responding officers were hurt.DeVine said a state law enforcement airplane helped authorities spot Cummins on the ground in a creek bed.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/suspect-s-parents-12-year-old-girl-among-7-victims-in-horrific-series-of-killings/27317324,2019-04-30T10:41:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

419,Family files claim: Daughter was sent lewd photos by now-former firefighter,"Nicholas Macchiarolo has taken a plea deal after he was accused of sending pictures of his genitalia to a 16-year-old girl. (Photo: File)

The family of a teenage girl who was sent lewd photos by a Marco Island firefighter has filed a notice of claim against the city and its fire department.

A letter from the Law Office of Roca & Linares announced the intent to pursue a claim for injuries and damages resulting from negligence and the actions of former Marco Island firefighter Nicholas Macchiarolo, who pleaded no contest nearly two months ago to a third-degree felony charge of unlawfully using a two-way communication device to facilitate or commission a felony.

The notice of claim is the first step in pursuing a lawsuit against a governmental entity in Florida. A lawsuit can proceed six months after the claim is submitted.

More: Marco firefighter who took plea has been terminated

As part of the plea deal, two counts of transmission of harmful material to a minor and one count of obscene use of a computer to seduce, solicit or lure a child were dropped. Macchiarolo, 27, was sentenced to three years of state probation, no contact with the victim or the victim’s family and the requirement of a psychosexual evaluation. He was also assessed fines and fees adding up $2,789.

The Collier County Sheriff's Office arrested Macchiarolo in May 2018 after the girl's mother contacted authorities about fears that her daughter was engaging in sexual activity.

In an interview with detectives, the girl told them that she had known Macchiarolo for years and only recently had their conversations turned sexual. Detectives learned that Macchiarolo had sent at least two pictures of his genitalia to the girl, who was 16-years-old at the time, in addition to talking about sex acts.

Macchiarolo admitted to detectives during an interview May 4 at the Marco Island Fire Department that he sent the photos and had sexually-charged conversations on Snapchat and Facebook Messenger, according to the arrest report. Macchiarolo, however, said that he believed she was 21-years-old at the time of the incidents.

One week after taking the plea deal, the Fire Department terminated Macchiarolo.

“Marco Island Fire-Rescue Department takes very seriously the conduct of its employees,” Fire-Rescue Chief Mike Murphy wrote in a prepared statement. “FF/EMT Macchiarolo has been given written notice of termination effective immediately. The actions and admission of by FF/EMT Macchiarolo are not consistent with the integrity, trustworthiness and decorum expected of a Firefighter of the City of Marco Island.”

The notice letter to the city also indicates that the family's attorneys are also investigating ""the existence of any additional parties who may have involvement in the subject incident.""

This is also not the first time in recent years that the city has been put on notice regarding potential litigation.

Last year, the woman involved in the police department's sex on duty scandal also filed a notice of claim for damages that resulted from the negligence in the hiring, supervision and retention of officers.

The incidents involving the police department resulted in two officers, Sgts. James Inlow and Neil Giansanti, resigning while under investigation and a third officer, Kevin Hennings, being terminated for engaging in sex acts while on the clock.

A fourth officer, Brian Granneman, received a reprimand for knowing of Inlow's actions but not reporting it to another supervisor. Granneman was promoted months later to a supervisory position.

The Watertown Daily Times reports that 26-year-old Shane Piche was sentenced to 10 years of probation after pleading guilty to third-degree rape.

He will also be registered as a Level 1 sex offender, which is considered low risk of re-committing the crime and is not included in online sex offender databases.

The judge said he gave Piche the lower-level designation because he had no prior arrests and there was only one victim.

New York State Police said Piche met his victim when he drove her school bus. However, he reportedly raped the girl at his home after giving her alcohol.

""He'll be a felon for the rest of his life. He's on the sex offender registry for a long time. Maybe not the rest of his life because of the level, but this isn't something that didn't cause him pain and this isn't something that didn't have consequences,"" Eric Swartz, Piche's defense attorney, told WWNY.

Piche was also ordered not to be left alone with anyone under the age of 17.

The victim's mother released a statement to WWNY, saying, ""I wish Shane Piche would have received time in jail for the harm he caused to my child. He took something from my daughter she will never get back and has caused her to struggle with depression and anxiety.""

433,Girls Going Places conference marks 20 years at FGCU,"A group of students on May 1, 2019, attend the 20th annual Girls Going Places conference in Fort Myers on May 1, 2019. (Photo: Photo courtesy Girls Going Places)

An annual meeting to encourage and educate young women marked 20 years Wednesday in Fort Myers.

About 140 teenage girls and 40 career women gathered to discuss and engage in games involving entrepreneurship, financial responsibility and working in the real world at the 20th annual conference of Girls Going Places.



Girls Going Places is a one-day event that prepares girls for entrepreneurship and introduces them to the skills, responsibilities and attitudes it takes to get there.



“It’s all about teaching young girls about financial independence, financial acumen, and teaching these young girls what it means to be an entrepreneur,” says Lynne Kimmich, who has directed the program for over 15 years. “And giving them the tools they need to be an entrepreneur.”



Each year, 140 girls from ages 12 to 18 are chosen for the one-day program, held at Florida Gulf Coast University. They are matched with 40 female mentors who are appointed, each from a different career field, to coach the girls about entrepreneurship and the basics of finance.

Most of the teens are nominated by school principals and guidance counselors from six Southwestern Florida counties stretching from Collier to Sarasota.



Kimmich asks the schools not simply to nominate top students. “There are so many girls that are wall flowers that tend to be successful entrepreneurs,” she explains. She selects which of the nominees attend the conference.



The program is not solely for girls interested in business. Firefighters, police, doctors and lawyers also have served as mentors and tell participants about their careers.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism



“It was awesome,” says Kayla Richmond, a family law attorney in Fort Myers who was a participant about 15 years ago and then a mentor in 2017. As a teenager she wanted to start a business as an adult.

She grew up with two brothers and assumed that, as a girl, her passion for financial issues made her something of an outlier — until she attended the Girls Going Places event.

“I learned there was a community of other girls out there doing it,” she says. She also was inspired by the powerful female mentors and realized there were women who could support her in reaching her goals.



Participants and mentors say that sense of female camaraderie gleaned at the conferences is one of its major benefits. “i think the greatest value for the girls is getting together — girls with such diverse talents and passions — and showing that through team work we can accomplish great things,” says Jeanne D. Persons, another Fort Myers lawyer who has been mentored previously and had planned to return this year.

“There’s a great value in the program, in the girls building relationships with women, with leaders in the community who have gone through many challenges of their own.”



One highlight, Kimmich says, is an exercise called “Budget Savvy.” The girls are allotted money and are asked to budget it for expenses, purchases, investments, savings, and philanthropy. They invariably overspend, Kimmich says, and then get to try again.The second time they become more budget conscious.



The girls interview mentors from fields that might interest them and also learn how the mentors have established their careers.



Emily Viner helped create Girls Going Places as a gender balance initiative and scholarship program two decades ago. She works in New York for Guardian Life Insurance, the parent company of Alliance Financial Group of Fort Myers, which is title sponsor of the conferences.

She says the conferences benefit both girls and mentors. The program lights a spark in the girls, she says, helping them see their potential to create something and launch a career of their choosing. The mentors, she says, “are rejuvenated by the enthusiasm of the girls.”

Because this year marks the 20th anniversary celebration, Viner said she would return to Fort Myers as a mentor in financial services.



Girls Going Places originated here and has spread to other locations. Viner said as many as 18 communities have held conferences.



The programs have altered somewhat since 1999. “They’ve grown with the changing times,” says Richmond. Yet, she adds, the focus has always remained the same — helping young girls become more financially literate and aware of the opportunities that await them.

434,Twin baby golden-headed lion tamarins welcomed at Gulf Breeze Zoo,"CLOSE Learn more about these golden-headed lion tamarin twins, named Derwin and Dahlia, who were born at Gulf Breeze Zoo to parents Hector and Dorothy. Jake Newby, Wochit

The Gulf Breeze Zoo welcomed two new furry little members to its family last month when a boy/girl set of twin golden-headed lion tamarins was born.

Now this week, Derwin and Dahlia are enjoying their general public debut, hanging out with their parents and exploring their tamarin exhibit stomping grounds of the zoo.

""They're explorers, they're constantly on and off their parents' backs,"" said Gulf Breeze Zoo Executive Director Bill Baker of the rare primates, who were born on March 18. ""And they're constantly playing, climbing and generally exploring everything in sight.""

Golden-headed lion tamarins, named for their distinguished golden manes, are endemic to Brazil. They are indigenous specifically to the State of Bahia, located in the northeastern part of the Atlantic coast.

Orangutans return: Gulf Breeze Zoo welcomes family of orangutans from Connecticut conservation center

The tiny tamarins have tails typically in the 12-15 inch length range, which is considerably longer than their 8-13-inch tall bodies. Even at their maximum weight, the species rarely exceed two pounds.

Like their monkey relatives, the tamarins are an arboreal species, meaning they spend a good chunk of their lives hanging out and sleeping in trees. The forest is their primary habitat.

""They are listed on the ICUN red list as an endangered species with a current population in the wild of about 1,000,"" Baker said. ""That figure is stable at the moment.""

Derwin and Dahlia are kin of Hector and Dorothy. Hector has been with Gulf Breeze Zoo since 2007 and Dorothy since 2010. Baker said the twins can be very attached to their parents but in the case of baby tamarins in general, it takes a village to raise them.

""The kids tend to be raised by the parents but there's also a lot of alloparenting coming into this, where other members of the group will raise them as well,"" Baker said.

The babies have six brothers and sisters, according to Baker, as they are the third set of twins birthed by Dorothy.

Staff at the zoo couldn't be more giddy to welcome babies of another endangered species into their confines. In early 2018, Katana the baby white rhinoceros became the first southern white rhino born at Gulf Breeze Zoo in its 34-year history.

""We are very excited, we've had a lot of victories, a lot of wonderful things happen this year,"" Baker said. ""Of course we had our family of orangutans come back from the Connecticut Zoological Conservation Center from LEO. Then, of course, there was Katana, as well. It's wonderful to have that group back. So, we've had a lot of really significant advances in conservation and advances in our collection.""

Guests can get a glimpse of the twin babies at the zoo on 5701 Gulf Breeze Parkway at the tamarin exhibit. The zoo is open seven days a week, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

435,How a violent confrontation led to a military veteran's death,"HOMESTEAD, Fla. - It was a story that shocked a South Florida community last year: An elderly military veteran with a gun was shot down by police in a hail of bullets.

New body camera video given to Local 10 News showed how and why it happened, and how possible discrimination by the man's apartment complex could have contributed to his death.

""For the love of God, man, please put your hands up!"" an officer can be heard shouting in exclusive body camera video obtained by Local 10 News.

The video details the desperate standoff between Miami-Dade police officers and 84-year-old Raymond Bishop. Bishop, a disabled military veteran, was threatening to shoot himself inside his apartment.

""I do not want to hurt you,"" said one officer. ""Sir you are a veteran. You are a hero to us. Please do not do this!""

The video is from February 2018, after a 911 call from Bishop's social worker Jaye Harkow with the Department of Veteran Affairs, brought officers to the Hidden Grove apartments near Homestead.



""He is a veteran. He has a disability of a visual problem,"" Harkow said on the call. ""I would say he's grossly depressed because the apartment where he is living is evicting him. He told me he was going to kill his two dogs and himself.""

The situation ended tragically when Bishop refused to drop his weapon and instead raised the handgun. Officers shot him six times, killing him.

The reason for the confrontation was an ongoing legal battle with management at Hidden Grove, who were trying to evict him over his two service and emotional support dogs.

""It ended horribly and it was unnecessary,"" said attorney Matthew Dietz of the Disability Independence Group, who is representing Bishop's family in the ongoing eviction case.

Court documents show Bishop suffered from multiple disabilities, including a loss of vision and mood disorders. The complex started trying to kick him out in July 2017, after one of his two small dogs was off leash and nearly bit a resident. But neighbors said the woman was fine and didn't want to take any action.

""The girl withdrew her charges,"" one neighbor who did not want to be identified told Local 10's Amy Viteri. ""But they (management) continued, because they wanted the apartment, period.""

Bishop went to his doctors at the VA, who provided letters saying his two dogs -- Ranger, who is 10 years old and blind, and Roxie, who is deaf with a deformed leg -- were essential to his well-being. Dietz said the property manager, Roxanna Sanchez, first refused to see Bishop and then ignored his letters.

""This is one of the largest management companies in the state of Florida,"" Dietz said. ""They're trained in the Fair Housing Act.""

Shortly before the shooting, management told Bishop that, regardless of what happened with the eviction case, they would not be renewing his lease when it was up at the end of the month. Bishop believed he and the dogs would have nowhere to go.

In her 911 call, Harkow said, ""We are having a very hard time finding him accommodations that will take care of the dogs.""

Bishop left a suicide note addressing the housing dilemma: ""I am incapable of keeping myself and my very precious friends, Ranger & Roxie in reasonable comfort and good health…There being no place that we three…can go together.""

""For Mr. Bishop, these dogs were his medication. They were his reason for living and waking up in the morning and when he thought he couldn't have them anymore, he killed himself -- technically, by using the police,"" Dietz said.

Crime scene photos showed one of the dogs hiding in the bed after the shooting. Both dogs have been living with a friend of Bishop's since the shooting.

Management at Hidden Grove had nothing to say when asked about the eviction.

Bishop's granddaughter Ashley Huntsberry-Lett spoke with Viteri from Virginia via Skype.

""It's not right to treat people that way,"" she said.

Huntsberry-Lett said management bullied her fragile grandfather to his breaking point.

""I feel that they're 100% culpable,"" she said. ""He was a disabled man who had nowhere else to go.""

Dietz said the complex had an obligation to try to address the concern before evicting Bishop and had an opportunity to show compassion.

""They know about what emotional support animals are,"" he said. ""And they knew what to do in this situation and they chose not to. And that's why Mr. Bishop is dead.""

Bishop's family also said his computers and televisions, which were visible in police photos, were missing from his apartment when management finally allowed relatives to enter.

An attorney representing Hidden Grove has not returned calls regarding this story.

440,"Camp counselor accused of molesting child, Flagler deputies say","FLAGLER COUNTY, Fla. - A former camp counselor molested a young girl on multiple occasions while working with the Boys & Girls Club several years ago, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

Dontia Deone Mobley, 34, was arrested Monday morning in connection with the abuse that allegedly happened between May 2011 and August 2012.

The victim told detectives that she was 9 or 10 years old when Mobley touched her inappropriately while she attended a Boys & Girls Club summer camp, according to the affidavit.

Deputies said Mobley confessed to molesting the victim.

“This person used his position of authority to abuse a young child,” Sheriff Rick Staly said. “I hope he is prosecuted to the furthest extent possible so that he cannot prey on anyone else. He deserves to serve the rest of his life in prison. Our detectives did a great job in closing this difficult case.”

Mobley is facing a charge of lewd and lascivious molestation on a victim under 12 years old. He's previously faced charges in Flagler County of aggravated child abuse, lewd and lascivious molestation and violation of felony probation.

PHOENIX (AP) — A 26-year-old Glendale man arrested in the shooting of his 6-year-old daughter told police he was cleaning a shotgun and explaining gun safety to her before he dropped the loaded weapon and it discharged, critically wounding her, authorities said.

Eldon Mcinville was arrested Thursday and remained jailed Saturday on suspicion of child abuse/reckless and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Court records don’t list a defense attorney who could comment on his behalf.

A probable-cause statement said the girl was shot in the abdomen and faced multiple surgeries and lengthy hospitalization.

According to the statement, Mcinville told police that he had recently purchased the double-barreled shotgun and was cleaning it for the first time. He also said his daughter was in the room where he “was teaching her gun safety.”

The statement said Mcinville was the one who called 911. He told the dispatcher his daughter’s “intestines were visible.”

According to azfamily.com, police said she was alert and asking questions when police and firefighters arrived on the scene.

“They said she was the bravest, strongest girl they’ve ever seen. She was talking. She wasn’t crying. She was asking questions as any 6-year-old would do and they airlifted her to a local Valley hospital in life-threatening condition,” police Sgt. John Roth said.

Police said they found a second loaded shotgun in the closet of Mcinville’s bedroom and a loaded revolver on a television stand.

During Mcinville’s initial court appearance, Commissioner Jane McLaughlin described the circumstances of the shooting as “exceedingly reckless” and ordered that he have no contact with the girl if he posts $50,000 bail and is released from jail.

“No contact with the alleged victim,” McLaughlin said as Mcinville cried. “I know she’s your daughter, but you may not have contact with her while the case is pending -- even if she contacts you first.”

Mcinville asked the judge to reconsider the release conditions.

453,Ex-Bunnell cop heading back to prison after plea deal,"A former Bunnell police officer released on probation in February only to be re-arrested 15 days later will be returning to prison for 15 years after accepting a plea deal with the state on Thursday.

BUNNELL — A former Bunnell police officer, convicted of child abuse in 2016 and released on probation in February only to be re-arrested 15 days later, will be returning to prison for 15 years after accepting a plea deal with the state on Thursday.

Michael Gerard Stavris II, 34, originally was arrested in 2014 and charged with posing as a teenage girl online to solicit boys for sexually explicit images. He pleaded no contest to felony child abuse and criminal use of personal information in July 2016 and was sentenced to three years in prison.

[READ ALSO: Bunnell cop accused of soliciting child porn]

[READ ALSO: Former Bunnell cop sentenced to 3 years in prison]

Stavris was released Feb. 11 and was serving five years of probation when, on Feb. 14, a criminal complaint was made that Stavris was using a juvenile victim’s identification, image and likeness to contact adult males while impersonating the juvenile. In his most recent violations, Stavris used a fictitious Facebook profile to engage in conversations with adult males, posing as a juvenile female, and made defamatory and derogatory comments about members of the victim’s family, court records show.

When a Flagler County sheriff’s detective and Florida Department of Law Enforcement agent showed up at Stavris’ home on Feb. 22 along with his probation officer, Stavris admitted that not only did he log in to his old Facebook account, he had created a new account using a female name, then instant messaged all of that female’s Facebook friends. A condition of his state-supervised probation prohibited him from using social media. He was re-arrested four days later, reports show.

[READ ALSO: Former Bunnell cop rearrested for violating probation on porn charge 2 weeks after release]

On Thursday, Stavris appeared before Circuit Court Judge Terence Perkins and accepted the plea deal offered by Assistant State Attorney Melissa Clark. The plea includes resolution of a violation of a probation charge, as well as new charges for felony child abuse, fraud through the use of personal identification, and stalking, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

As part of the deal, Stavris will return to state prison for five years for the violation of probation charge, with credit for time-served, followed by 10 additional years for the new charges. The deal also requires Stavris to complete five years of sex offender probation after his release, which includes no internet, no social media, no volunteer work around children, and no contact with his victims.

Stavris also must undergo polygraph examinations at his expense, mental health treatment, and other standard conditions associated with sexual offender probation.

“We consider this resolution a success and I’m glad to see that Stavris will go back to prison for a long

time,” Sheriff Rick Staly said Thursday in a written statement. “This defendant has been preying on juveniles and women since 2011 and didn’t learn his lesson even after spending nearly three years in prison the first time, so it’s time to go back where he can’t prey on children.”

Stavris worked for the Bunnell Police Department for four years prior to his original arrest in 2014.

458,"Ohio boy, 8, who saved himself and sister from kidnapping is praised for quick thinking","- A police department in Ohio is praising the actions of an 8-year-old boy after he saved himself and his sister from an attempted kidnapping on Thursday when their grandmother's vehicle was stolen.

The incident happened in Middletown, Ohio after the children's grandmother had gotten out of the vehicle while taking another woman into the emergency room at a hospital and 24-year-old Dalvir Singh jumped into the driver's seat.

That spurred the boy, identified by Middletown Police as Chance, and his sister Skylar to take action as the vehicle sped away.

""This little guy is a hero. No question,"" Middletown Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw said in a statement. ""He pulled his sister out of the car with no concern for his own safety. That is incredible at his age and outstanding work by Officers Kirby and Engleka to find the suspect and take him down without incident.""

As the vehicle began to take off, Chance opened the door of the vehicle to escape as his sister attempted to jump until Singh grabbed the girl's hoodie, according to police.

""We both started screaming and then my grandma went out and grabbed a hold of the car and he just kept opening and shutting the door trying to get her off,"" Chance told FOX19.

Her brother was eventually able to grab a hold of her and pulled her away from the 24-year-old, sending both children tumbling out of the car in a moment that was captured on surveillance video.

""What do you see here? If three heroes was the answer then you are correct!"" police said in a Facebook post.

""Chance made sure that he and his sister Skylar got out of their car when it was stolen,"" police said. ""They weren't about to be taken by some stranger!""

The grandmother of the children, 69-year-old Nita Coburn, made a valiant effort to save the kids by trying to grab onto a door before being dragged. Coburn did not suffer any serious injuries after the incident, according to FOX19.

Singh, who police said is addicted to heroin, was taken into custody and charged with two counts of kidnapping, felonious assault and grand theft.

459,Daddy Duty: A 4-year-old can be a great teacher,"Buy Photo Isabella points to the bird house that she had just hung from the limb of a tree in our backyard. (Photo: Tim Walters/FLORIDA TODAY)

With only a few weeks remaining before I retire Daddy Duty, I wanted to make sure my last few columns were meaningful.

The whole purpose of Daddy Duty has been to help parents understand they’re not alone in what they are going through. It also is meant to give a dad’s perspective on raising a girl.

As I searched my mind for what I could write about this week, I watched my 4-year-old Isabella blissfully playing with her toys and watching cartoons.

Buy Photo Tim Walters, Daddy Duty (Photo: Malcolm Denemark/FLORIDA TODAY)

It made me smile. It also made me realize that even though I try to teach her the right way to do things by setting a good example, there are also plenty of things I have learned from her.

Here are some examples.

Be patient.

I would be lying if I said I never raise my voice. I get upset and occasionally yell just like anyone else.

However, over time, my yelling out of frustration has gotten less and less. Having a child has given me the type of patience that you just don’t understand unless you have a child of your own.

If you don’t, you’re not in the club.

Disconnect.

My wife and I could be doing work all the time. But we also have a delightful daughter we want to spend time with.

As parents, we have to disconnect and enjoy our children now because they grow up so quickly.

If you’re always pushing them away so you can finish some work-related thing that you didn’t finish at the office, you may need to reprioritize.

Doing that occasionally is OK. Doing it all the time can be detrimental.

I know we live in a busy world, but our families, especially our small children, need our attention now more than ever.

Be happy.

Isabella has grown up in a positive setting with plenty of encouragement, and thus, she has developed into a smiley, positive, care-free child.

Many mornings she wakes up smiling. She dances around the house and sings. It’s infectious.

We spend so much time in our lives hurrying around, getting annoyed by other people or getting angry in traffic.

Sometimes, it’s OK to slow down and be happy for no reason.

More: Daddy Duty: There's never a bad day in Candy Land

More: Daddy Duty: How homework is a good thing for a preschooler

More: Daddy Duty: 'Do this, don't do that, can't you read the signs?'

Do what you love to do.

When Isabella wakes up, she wants to eat cereal and watch cartoons.

When she gets home from school, she either wants to go to the park, watch cartoons, play Candy Land or do other things that please her.

We parents need to do that.

I know finding time for ourselves can be tough, but even if you carve out a couple of hours on a certain day of the week, it’s possible.

For me, Wednesday is my bowling league. I might not get out the other six nights, but I know at least on that one night, I have somewhere to be and it’s doing something I love.

Ask questions.

I’m a journalist, so asking questions is in my nature. However, for others, it is not.

Isabella is getting to that point where she asks a lot of questions as she learns about the world.

As we get older, we ask fewer questions, sometimes out of fear of looking ignorant, and sometimes for other reasons.

The only way to learn is to ask. And don’t always rely on Google. It’s a good way to check on something, but as technology takes over more of our lives, we aren’t communicating, human-to-human, near as much as we once did.

If you don’t like something, say something.

If a 4-year-old doesn’t like something, they have no problem telling you.

Adults don't necessarily express themselves as freely as a child might.

Speaking your mind and voicing your opinion can be a scary thing, but that’s the only way to truly be happy.

The more you bottle up, the less happy you’ll be.

I’m sure there are plenty more lessons I’ve learned from Isabella. She’s an incredible little lady and I look forward to each new day with her.

Kids grow up fast. Soon, Isabella will want to be with friends or lock herself in her room.

I want to take in every moment I can with her before those things happen.

Take time to observe your kids, and try to be a little more like them.

We spend so much time trying to mold them to be like us that we can forget that they can teach us as much as we can teach them.

461,"TV show produced by Leo DiCaprio, 'Right Stuff,' will film in Brevard","CLOSE From ""Transformers"" and ""Armageddon"" to a Bond, James Bond, film (""Moonraker!""), here are 8 movies filmed at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Video by Jennifer Sangalang, FLORIDA TODAY Wochit

""The Right Stuff,"" a new television series adapted from Tom Wolfe's iconic account of the early days of the U.S. space program, will start filming this fall on the Space Coast.

Leonardo DiCaprio will be one of the executive producers of ""The Right Stuff."" Appian Way Productions, a film and television production company founded by DiCaprio, is collaborating on the project with National Geographic Partners LLC and Warner Horizon Scripted Television.

A number of films and episodes of reality television shows have been filmed on the Space Coast in recent years. But Space Coast Film Commissioner Bonnie King believes ""The Right Stuff"" will be the first television series filmed in Brevard County since ""The Cape,"" a space-themed series which aired in in 1996 and 1997, and had among its stars Adam Baldwin and Corbin Bernsen.

King said she got confirmation recently that ""The Right Stuff"" would film here and in the Orlando area, although many details are still being worked out.

King said she is pleased that the Space Coast was selected as a filming location, since ""this is where it all happened. It's the right thing to do for 'The Right Stuff.'""

Having a television series filmed here will provide a boost to the local economy, both in terms of jobs and in spending at local hotels, restaurants and stores. And it could have a spinoff tourism effect, as people come to the area to see the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex and other locales depicted in the show.

In announcing that it was green-lighting the project, National Geographic described ""The Right Stuff"" as taking ""a clear-eyed, non-nostalgic look at the lives of these ambitious astronauts and their families, who became instant celebrities in a competition that would either kill them or make them immortal.""

""The first season, which uses the book as its starting point, takes place at the height of the Cold War in 1958, when the Soviets are dominating the space race,"" National Geographic said. ""The public is in fear of a nation in decline, so the U.S. government conceives of a solution — NASA’s Project Mercury — creating the country’s premier astronauts from a handful of the military’s adrenaline-junkie test pilots. Seven individuals, known as the Mercury 7, are plucked from obscurity and soon forged into heroes long before they have achieved a single heroic act.""

Season 1 will have a focus on the drama as ""two archrivals — John Glenn and Alan Shepard — jockey to be the first in space.""

Details on the cast, production schedule and specific filming locations have not been announced.

King said she has been working with the production team over a period of months in scouting potential sites to film the show.

King also is president of Film Florida, a not-for-profit trade association representing the film, television and digital media industries, as well as deputy director of the Space Coast Office of Tourism.

Mark Lafferty, who will be an executive producer and ""show-runner"" leading the development of the series, said in a statement that “The Right Stuff"" is ""about a moment when the country looked in the same direction to achieve the stuff of fantasy, and on a timeline that was nearly impossible. The story is a reminder of what we’re capable of, but it also shows how much we’ve changed and diversified over time.""

Carolyn Bernstein, executive vice president for global scripted content and documentary films for National Geographic, said the stories of the Mercury 7 astronauts depicted in Wolfe’s 1979 bestseller ""are engaging, provocative and timeless. The book’s narrative aligns perfectly with the qualities that we look for in scripted projects: fact-based, wildly entertaining and pushing the limits of human achievement.”

The premiere episode of ""The Right Stuff"" will have as its director and executive producer David Nutter, whose credits include “Game of the Thrones” and “Band of Brothers.""

National Geographic said subsequent seasons of ""The Right Stuff"" will carry through to the Apollo space program, where humankind saw one of its greatest achievements in 1969 — man setting foot on the moon — and missions beyond.

The Space Coast this year is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, the first to land astronauts on the moon.

DiCaprio has movie ties to the Space Coast, too.

Playing a supporting role alongside Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton in ""Marvin's Room,"" the Academy Award-winning actor filmed scenes here more than 20 years ago.

Shortly after his role in ""Titanic"" made him a global superstar, DiCaprio visited the Space Coast to watch John Glenn become the oldest man in space.

Wolfe's book also was the basis of a 1983 film by the same name whose cast included Ed Harris (playing astronaut John Glenn), Dennis Quaid (astronaut Gordon Cooper) and Sam Shepard (test pilot Chuck Yeager).

Film Florida says Florida has lost more than $1 billion in lost potential business to other states because Florida no longer has production incentives for the film and television industry.

Within Brevard County, among the losses Film Florida cites involving space-themed films and television series are $25 million for ""Astronaut Wives Club,"" $16 million for ""Cocoa Beach,"" $10 million for ""First Man"" and $10 million for ""Hidden Figures.""

462,Watch this father's touching 'heartbeat' ritual with his sick baby daughter,"- At only 6 months old, Opal Rose Trimble is in the fight of her life.

On March 2, the precious baby girl from Shawnee, Oklahoma was diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a rare, neurological disease that affects an area of the spinal cord called gray matter. This can cause a person's muscles and reflexes to become weak. Opal has been in the hospital ever since.

Her mother and father, Gretchen and Josh Trimble, spend every moment they can by her hospital bedside.

Josh also has a 5-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter to take care of, so he sometimes has to leave, but the loving father has found a special way to let Opal know he is always with her.

Last week, Gretchen Trimble recorded a video of Josh saying good-bye to Opal at the Center Rehabilitation Hospital in Bethany, Oklahoma. As he stood over her crib, Josh pounded on his chest. Just seconds later, Opal mimicked her father, pounding on her chest, too.

Josh said that their new ritual is his way of showing Opal he's always with her and there for her, and that they ""share a heartbeat.""

After spending weeks being nearly immobile, the 'heartbeat' gesture is hopeful sign that Opal is getting stronger every day.

""We had just finished some hard days of physical therapy for Opal, and her physical therapist had been trying to get her to reach out for things,"" added Gretchen. ""We were just so encouraged because the fact that she was mimicking him told us she knew what she wanted to do, and she did it.""

""Compared to when this all started, she has made strides,"" Gretchen tells Fox 35. ""She continues to make small improvements everyday. Her mobility is getting better and better.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control, AFM is so rare that less than two out of a million children in the U.S. get it each year. The disease had only been on the CDC's radar since 2014, when they saw a large number of cases being reported.

""We still have a long road ahead of us, but we are so encouraged by how much she has improved in the past few weeks,"" said Gretchen.

463,"Properly Posh Baby, a new upscale baby boutique, opens in downtown Pensacola","CLOSE The top names in child's clothing, from Abel & Lula to Lemon Loves Lime, can be found at Properly Posh Baby. The new baby boutique opened in March. Jacob Newby, jnewby@pnj.com

A burgeoning new business below the downtown Pensacola Southtowne apartments wants to make sure your little one is dressed in some of the most stylish brands the children's clothing industry has to offer.

Properly Posh Baby, an upscale baby boutique, opened in March at 150 S. Jefferson St., next door to Old City Market Inc. Owner Kelly Taylor had been running Properly Posh Baby strictly as an online shop for the past two years until the opportunity arose to expand into her first brick and mortar store.

Dresses, tops, bottoms, swimsuits, special occasion lines, accessories and more are sold at the new boutique. The new Pensacola retailer carries dozens of the most popular baby clothing brands in the U.S., and though the selection is bigger for girls, boys clothing is also available.

""Our prices range, like some of our swimsuits are Target-priced swimsuits,"" said Taylor, a 13-year Pensacola resident and Mississippi native. ""The upscale caters more to the environment. And the shopping center here is kind of all upscale.""

Also open at Southtowne

► Stay The Spa opens refreshing new space in downtown's Southtowne complex

On the higher end, Properly Posh carries the luxury Spanish brand Abel & Lula, which Taylor said has been donned by a certain toddler in the British royal family.

""This is a brand that ships from Spain and they actually make designer stuff just for Princess Charlotte,"" Taylor said. ""That was the one specialty line I decided to pick up that was higher end.""

The store named by Taylor's sister — or as the Pensacola baby boutique owner puts it, ""the creative one in the family"" — carries everything from newborn sizes up to a girl's size 12. A mother of one, Taylor said she recognized her niche in the retail industry when friends would consistently pick her brain on newborn fashion.

""I've just always had an eye for baby and kids fashion,"" said Taylor, whose job history includes managerial stints at both Victoria's Secret and Coach. ""People always came to me and asked me what to dress their kids in.""

Almost every brand and item on the racks and walls of the cozy 1,000-square-foot boutique can also be found on the Properly Posh website, properlyposhbaby.com.

""It's kind of weird, now that the brick and mortar is here, the online popularity is growing,"" Taylor said.

Other designer brands carried at Properly Posh include Haute Baby, Lemon Loves Lime, Baby Biscotti, Mustard Pie and Baby Sara. The store also sells candles and the popular but elusive Noodle & Boo baby lotion line.

Taylor's shop is still so new that the outdoor signage isn't even up yet. But she said she's received a very warm welcome from downtown Pensacola during her first month and change of business.

""I didn't even know I wanted to be downtown a couple of years ago, but I'm so happy to be here,"" Taylor said. ""The foot traffic with the (YMCA) next door has been great and we're getting a lot of business off the Saenger Theatre when they do the Cinderella shows and the kids shows, a lot of people are here with their families.""

Properly Posh is open seven days a week, from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday and noon until 5 p.m. Sunday.

464,Brent Batten: A musical trip down bad memories lane,"Damn right we should take down that statue of Kate Smith and stop playing her version of “God Bless America” at ball games.

The kind of racism exhibited in songs she recorded 80-plus years ago has no place in society.

You know what also has no place in society?

Domestic violence.

That’s why we need to take down all the tributes and stop playing recordings of the music of Carole King. Sure, she has written a lot of great music over the years, but her 1962 piece, “He Hit Me,” can’t be ignored. “He hit me, and it felt like a kiss, he hit me, but it didn’t hurt me, he hit me, and I knew he loved me. If he didn’t care for me, I could have never made him mad, but he hit me, and I was glad.”

The Crystals, who recorded the song, must be written out of the music world as well.

Violence against women is described in several of their songs from the 1960s.

“I’d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man,” is the first line of 1965’s “Run for Your Life.”

The 1969 song, “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer,” is a jaunty tune about — murder? “Bang clang Maxwell’s silver hammer came down upon her head/Bang clang Maxwell’s silver hammer made sure that she was dead.”

Paul McCartney’s lyric, “I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved,” from 1967’s “Getting Better” at least acknowledges that the behavior was wrong. But admitting to past mistakes can’t save you from the social justice crusade. Take down those Beatles statues.

Ol’ Blue Eyes, the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Frank Sinatra was a hell of a singer but also was known to be a jerk when it came to his attitudes toward women.

That attitude is reflected in his version of one of the most sexist songs ever, “Wives and Lovers.” “Hey, little girl, comb your hair, fix your make-up. Soon he will open the door. Don't think because there's a ring on your finger, you needn't try any more.”

And they play one of his songs after every Yankees home game?

Popular artists from past eras have done work that shocks current sensibilities.

The best way to confront that reality is to dismiss their entire body of work and expunge them from history.

Or, we could recognize that the human condition differs from time to time and place to place.

We could be heartened by the fact that once acceptable biases and stereotypes are no longer mainstream thinking as society evolves and becomes more enlightened.

We could acknowledge the talent and contributions of people in the past, knowing that they, like the rest of us, weren’t perfect and their imperfections were sometimes recorded for posterity.

We could think ahead with a degree of empathy to a time when our behavior, recorded and broadcast much more routinely than in any previous era, might be looked back on by some future generation in a less-than-favorable light.

Nah, it’s easier to just take down the statues and stop playing the songs.

465,Parrot taken into custody after tipping off alleged drug dealers about raid,"Are all parrots as fiercely loyal as the one in this story? (Stock image)

It’s unclear whether the suspect is a victim in this case or a true gangster in the purest form.

Police in Brazil took a parrot into custody last week during a raid targeting crack dealers, after the animal reportedly cawed ""Mum, the police!"" in Portuguese, as officers prepared to raid the home of two suspected dealers, according to published reports, including ones in The Guardian and The Washington Post.

Police showed up in Vila Irmã Dulce, a neighborhood in northeast Brazil, when the parrot got loud.

""He must have been trained for this,” one of the police officers told Brazilian media, as reported by The Guardian. ""As soon as the police got close, he started shouting.""

Regardless of the heads up from the parrot, police arrested a man and a teenage girl. Their names have not been released, nor has the parrot’s.

Officers brought the bird back to the station -- yes, really -- but the animal was pretty tight-lipped. In fact, the parrot remained silent, despite authorities' best efforts.

Hey, the parrot was (reportedly) taught how to cry for help. It seems he was taught not to snitch, as well.

""Lots of police officers have come by and he’s said nothing,"" a veterinarian said, according to The Guardian.

Authorities eventually turned over the most loyal bird of all time to a local zoo, where he’s now living a crime-free life (we can only hope).

467,Man will not go to prison for sexually abusing captive teen,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Michael Wysolovski.

ATLANTA (AP) — A Georgia man has been sentenced to time served for keeping a teenage girl in sexual captivity for more than a year.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports 33-year-old Michael Wysolovski was sentenced to 10 years, with eight months of jail time, after pleading guilty Thursday to first degree cruelty to children and interstate interference with custody.

Wysolovski will receive credit for eight months spent in detention before his trial, meaning his prison time has already been served and probation will account for the remaining nine years and four months of the sentence. He must also register as a sex offender for life.

He was arrested in 2017 after law enforcement found a 17-year-old North Carolina girl who’d been missing for over a year in his home in Duluth, a suburb north of Atlanta.

The two met in an online forum for anorexia when the girl, who is not being named because she is a sexual assault victim, was 15 and said she was unhappy at home. Wysolovski later convinced the girl to come live with him, picking her up when she was 16 on the side of an interstate near her Charlotte area home.

Georgia’s age of consent is 16, so Wysolovski could not be charged with child molestation.

Prosecutor Michael DeTardo said the victim and Wysolovski initially agreed to enter into a sexual relationship in which they simulated non-consensual sex acts. But overtime, Wysolovski violated the agreement, using “excessive force” and refusing to recognize “safe words.” DeTardo said Wysolovski also used food to punish the victim, who was anorexic, or force her to perform sex acts.

The newspaper reports that DeTardo said the relationship was a “gray area” of consent that would be risky to bring before a jury. Rape and aggravated sodomy charges were dropped in the plea deal, and the victim’s family and DeTardo prioritized a requirement for Wysolovski to register as a sex offender.

Wysolovski told the court he believed he was helping the victim escape a bad home life.

Police located the girl after she contacted another person on an anorexia forum who contacted the FBI.

During a victim impact statement Thursday, the girl’s father said she was found malnourished, with ringworm and suffering from back problems because she had been repeatedly held in a dog cage.

Holding a stuffed animal and speaking in a soft voice, the victim told the court: “The psychological damage Michael Wysolovski inflicted is beyond imagination.”

468,"Ball boys, girls serve critical role in fluidity of Tallahassee Tennis Challenger","CLOSE WATCH: Pia Neustadter, Lily Dennis, Gabe Garcia, Elizabeth Adkison Seay and Chloe Dennis on being a ball boy/girl at the Tallahassee Tennis Challenger. Rory Sharrock, Tallahassee Democrat

Over the past 20 years, the Tallahassee Tennis Challenger has built a reputation for attracting talented players from across the globe to its clay courts.

On the same level of excellence, the famed tournament is also known for its quality group of volunteers. These individuals provide top-rate service throughout the week as the unsung stars of the event.

Perhaps the most notable bunch are the ball boys and girls.

While fans watch the singles or doubles competition for entertainment, the ball boys and girls are observing the action to ensure the fluidity of the match.

As quickly as a serve or return sails out of bounds, the children are on spot to retrieve the ball.

This coveted position features a host of returners as well as first-timers serving in this role.

Officials confirmed an estimated 70 kids listed on the roster. They come to Forestmeadows Tennis Complex on differing days and times based on their availability.

Prior to joining the crew, potential ball boys and girls must attend two 90-minute practices. These sessions feature simulated matches with balls hit at top speeds.

Quickness and alertness are the critical elements required to be chosen for the position. They learn to swiftly collect loose balls and the discipline of tennis etiquette.

""Everything is with urgency,"" said Elizabeth Adkison Seay, USTA volunteer who oversees the ball boys and girls at the Tallahassee Tennis Challenger.

""I told one boy to move like your house is on fire. Everything must be really quick. It's very disciplined. You have to be still. You have to keep your hands back while they're playing, or you'll be called out by the chair umpire.""

The ages for ball boys and girls range from 10-18 years old.

A typical weekday for begins after 2 p.m. when school ends. Children report for duty throughout the afternoon and evening. Some have stayed at the facility until 10 p.m.

While on site, the children are assigned to specific courts.

There's also a customized rest area where they use their laptops and cellphones. They can finish homework and eat their meals. Lunch and dinner were provided from the food cart and parents who donated pizzas.

Working as a ball boy/girl is beneficial beyond tennis. Students can use time toward any school-required volunteer hours.

However, the commitment to service centers around a love for all things tennis and the appeal of the city's premier tournament.

""I love being close to the players and running to get all the balls. Being out here makes me feel happy and excited,"" said third-year ball boy Gabe Garcia, a home-schooled sixth grader who competes on the tennis team at Community Christian School (CCS).

Working as a ball boy or girl provides a sense of responsibility and confidence. It also gives them a firsthand look at the behind-the-scenes structure of a tennis tournament.

""It's a really great experience. You get to be out here with the players. At first, you feel a bit timid, but then the more you work, the more comfortable you feel on the court. Then, the better you feel about your performance,"" said Chloe Dennis, fifth-year ball girl and freshman at Lincoln High School.

Although there are no daily financial rewards, the boy and girl who volunteered the most hours receives a check for $100 at the conclusion of the tournament.

This creates a competitive atmosphere for kids seeking to be in attendance on a regular basis.

Seay and colleague, Pia Neustadter, are the ball boy/girl coordinators at the Tallahassee Tennis Challenger.

These ""ball kid moms"" are equally passionate about the service as the kids. They enjoy the great tennis and sharing a common love for the sport with the youths.

""We're honored to be here. It's a great experience. We continue to have wonderful children come out every year,"" Neustadter said.

""The children do the work. They make our jobs easy. They take it very seriously. No one is making them be here.

470,"Attorney on child porn: Man, 60, didn't 'knowingly' have sex with teenage girls","<p>About six years ago, a RipoffReport user from Fort Lauderdale warned users about Neil Greenberg, the owner of Independentgirls.com, saying he was taking advantage of vulnerable teenage girls who didn't have a family or had drug problems.</p>

<p>Deputies came across Greenberg earlier this year while searching for a teenage girl who had vanished from a group home Jan. 10 in Broward County. The teenage girl had been using the tablet of another teen at the group home to communicate with him and didn't close the application. </p>

<p>The communication revealed the girl was engaging in prostitution with the 60-year-old man who is now facing 36 counts of production of child pornography and 36 counts of possession of child pornography in Broward, deputies said. </p>

<p>""There is no other way I can make money,"" the girl wrote in a message to Greenberg, according to the police report. </p>

<p>Greenberg's Fort Lauderdale-based defense attorney, Matthew Glassman, said Friday his client is innocent. His Independentgirls.com site, Glassman said, has nothing to do with underage girls and they are going to prove it in Broward County court. </p>

<p>""I think it's turning into a witch hunt ... they are just trying to make this man look like a monster,"" Glassman said about Greenberg's case, adding that if detectives ""had more people and if they knew who they were, they wouldn't be doing this and all they are trying to do is conjure up more dirt on a guy who has been a productive citizen of Broward County.""</p>

<p></p>

<p>During their investigation, detectives learned Greenberg used his site -- also known as IndiBoard, Indi or Indie -- to get payments from both the members who were paying for sex and the advertisers who were engaging in prostitution, according to court documents in the case. Detectives believe one of the girls was as young as 14 or 15 years old. </p>

<p>""This man never, ever solicited someone, never knowingly went after a child under the age of 18,"" Glassman said. </p>

<p>Deputies said the charges in the case stem from the 36 child porn videos they found Monday, April 15, at his home, 2350 NW 139 Ave., in Sunrise. The videos were in a memory card that was hidden under the gray felt material of a locked safe that he kept in his bedroom closet, according to a police report.</p>

<p>Strangely, it seems Greenberg expected the videos in the memory card to become evidence. They were inside a folder that was labeled for ""evidentiary purposes ONLY"" and there was also a ""Read_this"" notepad document saying he didn't ""knowingly"" acquire or view child porn.  </p>

<p>""I have never knowingly had sexual relations with an underaged girl,"" the message read. ""It is not something I am interested in and never have been. I have long maintained that I enjoy the company of young ladies, but 18 years old or older is just fine with me.""</p>

<p>Detectives spoke to one of the girls who said she was 16 years old, but told him she was 17. Investigators believe she met with Greenberg for sex about 20 times during a two-year period and Greenberg recorded her at least six times. </p>

<p>In another case, detectives believe a girl met with Greenberg for sex at his home 10 to 15 times and at least two of those meetings were recorded as recently as February. The girl, who is 17 years old, charged $200 to $300 per meeting, police said. </p>

<p>Detective Michael Joo accessed a record of Greenberg's communication on social media. Last year, one of his advertisers, identified in a police report as Jackie Perez, asked him for help finding clients. She also asked if he knew any dentists who could ""fix"" her cavity in exchange for sex. He didn't help. </p>

<p>""You've got to hang in there. It's not like the old days,"" he wrote and added that ""there's been a lot of changes on the website in the last few months.""  </p>

<p>When deputies searched Greenberg's home, they also found his weapons cache, which includes four rifles and a dozen handguns. There were also two semi-automatic pistols with silencers. Glassman said there was nothing illegal about his weapons. </p>

<p>""He is not a convicted felon,"" Glassman said. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The investigators with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Miami Cyber and High Tech Crimes Squad, the BSO Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) unit and the Sunrise Police Department are asking anyone with information about the case to call Detective Joo at 954-888-5327.</p>

LAKE WALES, Fla. (WFLA) – A 19-year-old man was arrested on Friday by Lake Wales police after he arrived at a location believing he was there to meet a 13-year-old girl for sex.

According to police, the case began Friday morning when a McLaughlin Middle School administrator observed the girl talking with Gustavo Adolfo Martinez, of Frostproof.

The conversation happened several blocks away from the school.

After speaking with the girl, administrators learned Martinez had been communicating with the girl via social media for about a year.

Martinez began sending the child explicit nude pictures of himself when she was 12-years-old and discussed sex acts with her.

Detectives learned Martinez and the girl had sex just prior to the administrator seeing them together.

A Lake Wales police detective began communicating with Martinez, posing at the child, and arranged to meet him Friday afternoon.

Martinez was taken into custody when he arrived at the location.

During an interview, he admitted to the relationship and to the sexual intercourse.

Martinez is charged with the following:

Lewd or Lascivious battery, 2nd degree felony

Using an electronic device to lure or entice a child, 3rd degree felony

Traveling to meet a minor, 3rd degree felony

Sending obscene material to a minor, 3rd degree felony

Unlawful use of a two way communication device, 3rd degree felony

Driving with no driver’s license, misdemeanor

LAKE CITY, Fla. (WFLA) - A 10-year-old Utah girl who was reported missing nearly a year ago was reunited with her father in Florida, News 4 Jax reported.

Authorities said Ariana Bozeman was kidnapped by her biological mother, 34-year-old Dawn Closson, after the girl's father was granted sole custody of the child.

Deputies located Bozeman and Closson at an interstate rest stop near Lake City Wednesday morning after pursuing a tip from an anonymous Florida resident who noticed something suspicious about the mother and daughter.

The tipster went online and read reports about the missing girl and called police, the news station reported.

""This is just a mindful and watchful resident that was able to help us bring this to justice and get the girl safely back,"" said Sergeant Isaac Akeroth of Enoch Police.

Bozeman and Closson were found inside of a vehicle with Closson’s boyfriend and several other children, authorities said.

Closson was arrested and charged with custodial interference across state lines, then booked into the Columbia County Jail. More charges are pending, according to police.

Closson's boyfriend and the other children inside of the vehicle were dismissed and Bozeman was placed into protective custody by the Department of Children and Families.

The girl's father, Adrian Bozeman, drove from Oklahoma, where he is stationed at an Air Force base, to Columbia County and was reunited with his daughter on Thursday. The news station reported that they spent the morning at Walmart to buy clothes for Ariana before they started their road trip home.

Adrian Bozeman told News 4 Jax he learned his daughter, Closson and her boyfriend had been living out of an RV, but ditched it and started living out of an SUV. The girl was homeschooled while they were on the run.

The father said he plans to enroll his daughter in a counseling program offered by the military.",http://www.wfla.com/news/florida/10-year-old-girl-missing-for-over-a-year-found-safe-in-florida/1900304761,2019-04-04T18:40:59Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
478,Daytona Beach Shores woman recalls childhood escape from Nazi Germany,"Beatrice Deutsch and her sister begged their mother to awaken them in time to see the Statue of Liberty as their ship entered New York Harbor.

But it was dark as they approached the port in the early hours of that March 1939 morning, and Bea’s mother let the girls sleep.

“(I wanted to see it) for the whole rest of my life,” said Bea, 85, of Daytona Beach Shores. “I’ve seen the Statue of Liberty from different places in New York, but I never saw it as an immigrant coming in.”

Bea and her family were Jewish refugees from Cronheim, Germany, a small Bavarian town about 100 miles northwest of Munich.

Her father, a Jewish spiritual leader, provided rabbinical services and slaughtered chickens and cattle for the Orthodox community’s kosher consumption.

Bea was born in her parents’ synagogue-attached apartment in 1933, the year Adolf Hitler came to power.

“There were lots of people in Germany that didn't think (Nazi ideology) was going anywhere. They thought Hitler was just a nut,” said Bea, whose surname is now Schemer. But her father wasn’t one of them. “He knew that he needed to take his family off of the European continent.”

Bea’s family sought asylum in South America in 1937, and gained entrance to the U.S. two years later. But before they left Germany, Bea got a taste of the roiling hatred that later would turn into full-fledged genocide.

“We all read about the history of the Holocaust and all of that, but individual experiences like (my family’s) need to be told,” Bea said.

She was only 2 in 1935 when Nazi Germany’s Nuremberg Laws institutionalized anti-Semitism, but she recalls the aftermath clearly.

As a toddler, she watched bright orange flames devour a neighbor’s home from the upstairs window of her family’s apartment. Firefighters blew trumpets in the street below, but they weren’t raising an alarm — they were celebrating.

“They were dancing in front of this burning house, not making any effort whatsoever to put it out,” Bea said. “Because the house was the house of Jews.”

Cronheim was known for the harmonious relationships between Jews, Catholics and Lutherans. But the Nuremberg Laws drove a wedge between Jews and their fellow citizens.

Vandals shattered three of the synagogue’s ground-to-ceiling stained glass windows while Bea’s family was home on the Sabbath.

Other threats were more direct.

“My sister and I would be outside playing and we would get attacked by the neighborhood boys,” Bea said.

One boy hurled a rock that struck her sister in the temple. “She bore a scar of that for the rest of her life.”

The Nazis targeted Jewish traditions — kosher meat was outlawed, and Jews could no longer conduct business with non-Jewish Germans.

But not everyone complied with the Nazi agenda.

A local farmer’s wife risked arrest to hide butter, milk and eggs under the stairs outside Bea’s home in the middle of the night so that her family would have something to eat.

In 1936, the Nazis notified Bea’s father that deportation was imminent.

Her mother’s German heritage dated back to the 1700s, but her father’s family had emigrated from Hungary when he was a child. The Nazis intended to send him back.

He immediately began applying for asylum and eventually was granted passage to Cali, Colombia.

In the event that he was deported before his family could set sail from Germany, he planned for Bea, her mother and sister to go live with Bea’s maternal grandparents in Amsterdam.

“I wouldn't be sitting here telling this story if we had wound up going with them,” Bea said. The Nazis invaded the Netherlands in 1940, and her mother’s relatives there were all sent to Sobibor death camp in Poland and exterminated.

Bea’s family boarded a ship from Hamburg to Colombia in April 1937. When they reached their cabin, they found the contents of their suitcases scattered across the floor. Two Nazi soldiers sifted through their belongings.

Jews weren’t allowed to take any valuables out of Germany, so Bea’s mother had sewn their family jewelry into the lining of her clothes.

“You could imagine how terrified she had to have been that they might find that,” Bea said. But they didn’t, and the soldiers left empty-handed.

Her father brought along his 177-volume rabbinical library to prevent Nazis from burning them.

About 50 Jews lived in Cali when Bea’s family arrived. Her father organized a synagogue, and by the time they left for New York two years later, the community had grown to about 300 Jewish refugees.

Bea’s family stayed in New York for six months, and then moved south to Jacksonville, where her mother’s brother taught in a local synagogue.

The war and the plight of their European relatives were ever-present worries.

They received letters from loved ones back home, but Nazis monitored and redacted the mail so details were scant.

News of Germany’s defeat came on Bea’s 12th birthday — May 7, 1945. But anti-Semitism didn’t just disappear.

Children yelled epithets at Bea and her sister, who was two years older, when they went outside to play. Her parents covered their windows during Jewish festival celebrations so the neighbors couldn’t see them lighting religious candles.

As a young adult, Bea was hired for a bank job — and then the manager began questioning her heritage.

“He said to me, ‘I’m sorry, but this bank does not hire Jews,” she recalled.

Despite those setbacks, Bea is a “very patriotic, proud American,” she said. “These are small incidents that occurred, but for the most part the United States of America saved my life.”

Bea has two daughters, and passed down to them the jewelry her mother smuggled from Germany. She also has one grandson.

She donated her late father’s rabbinical library to the University of Florida. The tomes are housed in the Rare Book Room of the Smathers Library Judaica Suite.

And in 2004, she finally captured the experience that eluded her as a young girl.

She went to New York City and took a boat tour to Liberty Island.

“I stood there and saw the Statue of Liberty as if I were coming in as an immigrant,” Bea said. “I will always remember how important that was to me.""

'Never forget'

The Holocaust survivors’ rallying cry has long been “never forget.”

As the youngest survivors age into their 70s, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., makes a special effort to preserve firsthand accounts in order to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike.

To honor this week's Days of Remembrance, established by Congress as the nation’s annual Holocaust commemoration, The News-Journal is sharing the individual accounts of four local Holocaust survivors.

Aimee Rubensteen, the museum's acquisitions coordinator, travels South Florida “rescuing the evidence of the Holocaust by speaking to firsthand witnesses,” she said, and collecting their World War II-era photos, letters, newspaper clippings, clothing and other artifacts of historical value.

“These original artifacts will be the things that teach the Holocaust to future generations,” Rubensteen said.

The museum’s mission is to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike and to encourage critical thinking about how and why those atrocities occurred.

Firsthand stories make those larger themes more personal.

“A lot of people don’t know about these specific, individual stories. The more we spread the word and expand the conversation, the better it is for everyone,” Rubensteen said.

Drake turned up the love for his mom when he picked up top artist, besting Cardi B, Ariana Grande, Post Malone and Travis Scott. He won 12 awards Wednesday in Las Vegas, making his career total 27 (Swift has 23 wins).

He looked up to the ceiling as he held the trophy, then said: ""I just want to thank my mom for her relentless effort in my life.

""I want to thank my mom for all the times you drove me to piano. All the times you drove me to basketball and hockey "" that clearly didn't work out. All the times you drove me to 'Degrassi.' No matter how long it took me to figure out what I wanted to do, you were always there to give me a ride, and now we're on one hell of ride,"" Drake said.

Family bonding was a theme at the three-hour show, which aired live on NBC and was hosted by Kelly Clarkson

Ciara's young son and husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, danced along while she worked the stage, and Nick and Joe Jonas gave kisses to Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner of ""Game of Thrones"" fame when they sang in the audience before hitting the stage. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco looked to his parents as he accepted top rock song, quoting the name of his current hit: ""Hey look Ma, I made it!""

Mariah Carey's twins cheered her on as she sang a medley of her hits and accepted the Icon award. She was in diva form before taking the award from Jennifer Hudson, throwing her napkin on the floor after dabbing her face with it.

""Without getting into all the drama, all the ups and downs of my career ... I guess I always felt like an outsider, someone who doesn't quite belong anywhere, and I still feel like that lost interracial child who had a lot of nerve to believe I could succeed at anything at all in this world. But, and this is the truth, I did believe because I had to,"" she said. ""The truth is I dedicated my life to my music "" my saving grace "" and to my fans.""

Cardi B, the night's top nominee with 21, locked lips with husband Offset on the red carpet and the couple sat closely inside the venue. She won six awards, including top Hot 100 song for ""Girls Like You"" with Maroon 5.

""I remember when Maroon 5 hit me up to do this song. I was like, 'Bro I'm five months pregnant. I can't even breathe.' But this record to me was so amazing. I was like, 'Oh this is going to be a hit.' And now I sing this song to my daughter because she's the girl that I need,"" she said.

Drake and Cardi B "" who both won multiple awards during the live telecast "" used their speeches to promote love and appreciation for their peers in the music industry.

Others, too, brought on the positive energy when onstage. Imagine Dragons' band leader Dan Reynolds used his speech to highlight the dangers of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. He earned rousing applause. Florida Georgia Line's Tyler Hubbard followed suit, telling the audience after winning top country song: ""In the spirit of so much truth being spoken tonight by so many talented artists, I think we should speak some truth.""

""As artists we all get to experience so many unbelievable things, but in our opinion, at the end of the day, it's all for nothing if you're not using your platform for better ... to spread love, to help those in needs, to be a light to your community,"" he said.

Swift kicked off the show when she brought her new music video to life with a colorful, eye-popping performance of her song ""ME!"" Dancers wearing bright, pastel colors spun in the air holding umbrellas and a marching band kicked off Swift's performance "" like most of the world, maybe she was inspired by Beyonce's new Coachella film?

Madonna, wearing an eye-patch, teamed up with Colombian singer Maluma for a performance, but it was Grammy-winning Christian artist Lauren Daigle who had the night's best performance. She sang ""You Say,"" giving the audience a calm, yet strong and powerful performance. She was backed by three awesome background singers and a pianist.

BTS, who performed alongside Halsey, also had a major night. At the Billboard Awards and American Music Awards, the K-pop band had only previously won ""social"" awards based off their fanatic fan base, but on Wednesday BTS picked up top duo/group, besting Grammy-winning groups like Maroon 5, Imagine Dragons and Dan + Shay.

""I still can't believe we're here on this stage with so many great artists,"" RM said as fans screamed loudly. ""We're still the same boys from six years ago, we still have the same dreams ... we still have the same thoughts. Let us keep dreaming.""

An unlikely winner at the Billboard Awards? ""Game of Thrones"" actress Maisie Williams, whose plays Arya Stark on the HBO series and shined brightly on last week's episode.

""Shout-out to Arya Stark for putting in that work last week,"" Drake said onstage after winning his first award of the evening.

Temples across Florida are heightening security measures after a gunman killed one member and injured three others at a California synagogue Saturday.Rabbi Bruce Benson, of Temple Beth El Israel, says it's painful to see constant attacks against the Jewish community. “It’s hurtful. It’s painful. There aren’t a lot of words. You sit numb at this point. It happens over and over and over and our society isn’t doing much to combat this,” the Port St. Lucie rabbi said. He and other religious leaders have discussed other ways to protect its members from attacks, plans he does not want to reveal to the public.“My congregations knows and I’m sure others know unequivocally if you think it’s just the guy at the front door, you’re making a mistake. It is not so,” Benson told WPBF. This is not the first-time temples in the area have had to adjust their security in recent times. The first instance occurred after 11 people were killed during the 2018 shooting in Pittsburgh.“Some of the security things we do are very visible. No one comes through the door without meeting a security guard first,” Benson explained.Over the past three years Temple Beth El Israel has experienced at least four instances of hatred according to Benson. During the most recent incident he says someone attached posters decorated with swastikas and various anti-Semitic statements, including stating “Hitler was right” to their front door.“When you see something like that taped to your synagogue, it’s debilitating. People walked in to that synagogue that night tearful. They had been abused and emotionally raped by the fact that hate was literally at their doorstep.”Benson believes there should be a visible law enforcement presence, but not too many. He says members should feel safe not fear while they are worshipping. “I’m not comfortable with them seeing uniforms and open weaponry,” Benson said. “I can tell you, just because you don’t see it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.""The rabbi feels communities across the country need to have tough conversations about terroristic incidents and not sweep “the darker side of America” under the rug. A service will be held to remember the holocaust and the victims of the Pittsburgh and California shootings at Temple Beth El Israel in Port St. Lucie Friday evening. “I will be sending out a letter to the faith communities of St. Lucie County and their leadership saying, 'Come. Come to this temple. Come be with us lockstep, arm in arm,' and just say people of all faith communities have had enough,” Benson added.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/treasure-coast-area-synagogues-ramp-up-security-after-california-shooting/27313376,2019-04-29T23:19:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

LAREDO, Texas (AP) — A South Texas woman granted probation for injuries to her infant son has been sentenced to prison after violating probation when the remains of her 2-year-old daughter were found in a bucket of acid.

Monica Yvonne Dominguez has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for violating probation after she was charged with evidence tampering and child abandonment involving her daughter’s corpse.

She had been sentenced to 10 years’ probation after pleading guilty in 2016 to injury to a child for injuries to her 9-month-old son. State District Jude Oscar Hale Jr. on Friday deemed the new charges violated that probation and handed down the prison sentence. Conviction on the new charges could mean up to two years in state prison on each count.

When a gunman opened fire in a synagogue in California, Lori Kaye jumped between the shooter and the rabbi.Kaye, 60, was shot at the synagogue and died at a nearby hospital. In addition to Kaye, at least three others were wounded in the shooting Saturday at Congregation Chabad in Poway, north of San Diego.Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, 57, had been shot in the hand when Kaye stepped between him and the gunman. The rabbi suffered what looked like defensive wounds to both of his index fingers, a doctor at the Palomar Medical Center said. Roneet Lev, a member of the congregation and Kaye's friend of 25 years, was not at the synagogue but told CNN she rushed to the hospital when she heard about the shooting. As Goldstein was being wheeled into surgery, he told her how her friend saved his life, she said.Kaye had attended services Saturday to say a Kaddish prayer for her mother, who died in November, Lev said.Kaye's husband is a physician and rushed to the scene to perform CPR after he heard about the shooting. When he realized his wife was a victim, he fainted, Lev said.""She didn't die a senseless death,"" Lev said.

According to police, the case began Friday morning when a McLaughlin Middle School administrator observed the girl talking with Gustavo Adolfo Martinez, of Frostproof.

The conversation happened several blocks away from the school.

After speaking with the girl, administrators learned Martinez had been communicating with the girl via social media for about a year.

Martinez began sending the child explicit nude pictures of himself when she was 12-years-old and discussed sex acts with her.

Detectives learned Martinez and the girl had sex just prior to the administrator seeing them together.

A Lake Wales police detective began communicating with Martinez, posing at the child, and arranged to meet him Friday afternoon.

Martinez was taken into custody when he arrived at the location.

During an interview, he admitted to the relationship and to the sexual intercourse.

Martinez is charged with the following:

Lewd or Lascivious battery, 2nd degree felony

Using an electronic device to lure or entice a child, 3rd degree felony

489,"Accused exposer could have more victims, Orange County deputies say","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - A man accused of exposing himself to multiple girls could have more victims, which is why Orange County deputies say they're asking residents to take a good look at his picture and report any suspicious incidents.

Wilfredo Nazario Jr., 35, was arrested Thursday on a felony charge of lewd and lascivious exhibition. Detective Carlos Robles said deputies caught Nazario in the act Thursday as he was inappropriately touching himself in front of a 12-year-old girl and 13-year-old girl as they were at a bus stop on West Oakridge Road.

""(The victims) were astonished about what happened. Obviously, it's something that (they) shouldn't be going through ... and unfortunately now these girls have to live with that,"" Robles said.

Robles said detectives had been conducting surveillance on Nazario since February, when a 13-year-old girl said a man in a red sedan committed a lewd act in front of her as she was walking to Union Park Middle School.

Video showed the man, later identified as Nazario, removing the license plate from his vehicle before he approached the girl, according to authorities.

Robles said detectives will investigate any and all tips from the public involving Nazario. Based on the way he operates, it's possible that he could have more victims, according to authorities.

""We again just ask the public to come forward. Anything that they think that they have, we'll get to it as thorough as we've done with all these investigations,"" Robles said.

Deputies on Friday reminded parents to talk to their children about avoiding potential predators.

""We always ask the parents, instruct your kids, have conversations with them, ask them how their day went and encourage them to walk in groups so they can call us if they need anything and to be aware of their surroundings as well,"" Robles said.

All three victims reported the incidents to authorities.

Anyone with information concerning Nazario or any similar cases is asked to call Crimeline at 1-800-423-TIPS (8477).

490,Uncle suspected in missing pregnant teen case: 'I am not a monster',"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Evidence in a sexual battery case against the uncle of Iyana Sawyer, a pregnant high school senior last seen the week before Christmas, indicates he may have been having sex with both the missing girl and her sister.

Police have said Johnathan Quiles, 33, is a suspect in both Sawyer's pregnancy and her disappearance but is not facing any charges connected to her.

Text messages contained in evidence obtained from the State Attorney's Office on Friday indicates he was expecting to be charged with Sawyer's death.

""I love them like my own daughters,"" Quiles texted an apparent family member. ""This is an act of pure desperation to put me away for the rest of my life.""

Video of a Jacksonville Sheriff's Office interrogation shows a detective telling Quiles that his brother told them Quiles admitted to choking her. The detective said Quiles' brother told them: ""She wasn't dying right and it was making Quiles sick looking at her.""

Detective: The question for you, Johnathan: Are you a monster? Are you?

Quiles: I’m not a monster. Not at all.

Detective: Look at her face. They need closure.

Quiles: I ain’t gonna look at her face. I’m not a monster. I had nothing to do with her disappearance.

News4Jax is going through more video, audio and documents in the case released Friday morning. return to this story in the afternoon and watch full reports on News4Jax newscasts at 5 and 6 p.m. for more details.

Sawyer's family members have been told the 16-year-old girl died on Dec. 19, 2018, the day she never made it home from Terry Parker High School, News4Jax learned. She was five months pregnant at the time.

VIDEO: Sources say missing pregnant teen died the day she disappeared

Quiles has not been charged with Sawyer's death.

Quiles remains in custody at the Duval County jail on the sexual battery charge. The victim in that case said she was babysitting Quiles' 3-year-old daughter when he approached her sleeping on a couch, rubbed her back, removed her clothes and had sex with her. The victim reported the assault to her mother one year after she said it happened.

During a bond hearing in that case earlier this year, prosecutors disclosed suspicions of Quiles' possible involvement in Sawyer's disappearance, accusing him of admitting to a fellow inmate that he may have impregnated Sawyer.

Anyone who saw Iyana Sawyer after she left school Dec. 19 or has any information about what heppened to her is urged to call Crime Stoppers at 888-845-TIPS.

PEMBROKE PINES — Authorities say a 38-year-old youth pastor at a now defunct South Florida church coerced a girl into having sex with him by threatening to turn her family in to immigration officials.

The Sun Sentinel reports Luis Clarke assaulted the 15-year-old girl over six months in 2016 and 2017 while he was a part-time youth pastor at Abrazo tu Sueno Church in Pembroke Pines. Clarke was arrested Thursday.

Pembroke Pines police said he faces 20 counts of sexual battery, two counts of false imprisonment, sexual performance by a child and lewd and lascivious exhibition.

Police Capt. Al Xiques says Clarke once forced a 15-year-old boy to watch him assault the girl. The boy went to police on April 3.

The report says Clarke admitted to two sexual encounters with the girl.

494,Video shows girl's controversial arrest in Miami Gardens,"<p>A video showing a Miami Gardens police officer arresting a 16-year-old girl near Carol City Middle School is making the rounds on social media Thursday.</p>

<p>While the teenage girl's family members say the video shows the officer used excessive force, a police department spokesman released a statement Thursday afternoon asking the public not to rush to judgment.</p>

<p>The unidentified officer was responding to reports of a fight April 18 outside of St. Monica Catholic Church at 3490 SW 191 St. A relative said the officer was mistaken when he believed the girl touched an officer when in fact she was reaching for her friend. </p>

<p>""My heart was broken. I could not believe this happened,"" said a relative who did not want to be identified out of fear of reprisal. ""She is on the fence, and then next thing, he picks her up and body slams her. He is like three times bigger than she is.""</p>

<p>The Miami Gardens Police Department's internal affairs unit is investigating allegations of police brutality and took the video into evidence. </p>

<p>""If that was a violent perpetrator or a man say the size of me that was not listening to the officer commands, do you think that would have been an appropriate use of force? Yes! Not on a child,"" the relative said. </p>

495,"Man who took license plate off car before exposing himself to teen arrested, deputies say","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - A man accused of removing the license plate from his vehicle before committing a lewd act in front of a teen has been arrested two months after the crime, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies said Thursday that Wilfredo Nazario Jr., 35, was arrested on a felony charge of lewd and lascivious exhibition.

On Feb. 12, a 13-year-old girl said she was walking to Union Park Middle School when a man with a scruffy beard in a dark red sedan approached her near East Colonial Drive and North Econlockhatchee Trail while committing a lewd act, according to authorities.

Can you ID? On Feb 12, at 8:30 am this man took the license plate off his car and approached a 13 year old girl in his vehicle while committing a lewd act near E Colonial & N Econlockhatchee. Our sex crimes detectives would like to arrest him. Call @CrimelineFL 800-423-TIPS pic.twitter.com/8rsxISxq5o — Orange County Sheriff's Office (@OrangeCoSheriff) February 15, 2019

The girl reported the encounter to a school resource officer, and a search for the man was launched.

Deputies released surveillance video recorded around the same time as the incident that showed a man park a red sedan, get out of the driver's seat and remove his license plate.

Authorities have not said what information led them to arrest Nazario in connection with the crime.

497,13-year-old girl dies after being jumped by classmates while walking home from school,"HOUSTON - A 13-year-old Texas girl has died after slipping into a coma following a fight with two teens who jumped her as she walked home from school — including one assailant who kicked her in the head, the girl's mother said.

Kashala Francis, a student at Attucks Middle School in Houston, died Wednesday morning at Texas Children's Hospital, where doctors discovered a tumor in the back of her head that may have been exacerbated by the fight she was involved in on Thursday afternoon, her mother, Mamie Jackson, told ABC station KTRK-TV in Houston.

It remained unclear and pending an autopsy if injuries from the fight caused Kashala's death or if she died as the result of the tumor, police said.

Victor Senties, a spokesman for the Houston Police Department, said the incident is being investigated as a homicide, pending an autopsy to determine the cause of death.

""Until the autopsy is finished, we won't know,"" Senties told ABC News on Wednesday.

He said no arrests have been made and declined to release further details of the investigation.

""I can see these girls kicking her in the head while other children are laughing at her,"" Jackson told KTRK of a video that surfaced of her daughter being punched and kicked.

In the video, at least one of the girls fighting with Kashala can be heard laughing.

Houston Independent School District officials released a statement saying they are aware of the ""off-campus altercation"" and cooperating with the Houston Police Department in its investigation.

Kashala's death follows a similar incident in Walterboro, South Carolina, where 10-year-old fifth-grader Raniya Wright died on March 27 after a fight with a classmate. On Friday, the South Carolina solicitor declined to file charges because a forensic pathologist determined Raniya had a rare birth defect, arteriovenous malformation, that caused her death.

Jackson said her daughter was jumped about a block from her school by two girls on Thursday as she was walking home.

She said that when Kashala came home from school on Thursday afternoon she had bruises on her face, but claimed she was fine.

By Saturday, Kashala briefly appeared to become delusional while spending the night at a relative's house and that she complained of severe headaches when she woke up on Sunday, Jackson told KTRK.

""I drove over and I told her to get up. I said, 'Get up, Kashala.' She kept saying, 'Mama, my head hurts,' so she laid down,"" Jackson said.

She said moments later, her daughter lost consciousness and she called 911.

Paramedics took the girl Texas Children's Hospital in Houston where she slipped into a coma.

Jackson said that while treating her daughter, doctors found the tumor in her head.

""We found out she has a large tumor in the back of her head, and she had fluid buildup in her brain,"" Jackson said.

It was too early to tell if the fight Kalesha was involved in contributed to her death.

507,Study: Release of '13 Reasons Why' on Netflix associated with increase in youth suicide rates,"Alisha Boe, Katherine Langford, Derek Luke, Dylan Minnette and Miles Heizer attend #NETFLIXFYSEE event for ""13 Reasons Why"" season 2 at Netflix FYSEE At Raleigh Studios on June 1, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.

- A study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health suggested that the release of the Netflix show “13 Reasons Why” was associated with a 28.9 percent increase in suicides among youth ages 10 to 17 in the U.S. in April 2017.

The Netflix series, released on March 31, 2017, tells the story of a young girl who committed suicide and left behind 13 tapes that explain why she decided to end her life.

The findings highlight the necessity of using best practices when portraying suicide in popular entertainment and in the media, according to the National Institutes of Health, which the NIMH is a part of.

“The results of this study should raise awareness that young people are particularly vulnerable to the media,” said study author Lisa Horowitz, Ph.D., M.P.H., a clinical scientist in the NIMH Intramural Research Program. “All disciplines, including the media, need to take good care to be constructive and thoughtful about topics that intersect with public health crises.”

The study, published in Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, was conducted by researchers at several universities, hospitals and the National Institute of Mental Health. NIMH also funded the study.

The web-based show generated questions about how the portrayal of suicide affects young people who watch it, the NIH said.

For the study, researchers analyzed annual and monthly data on deaths due to suicide sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data included information about the death of individuals between the ages of 10 to 64 that occurred between Jan. 1, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2017. That timespan encompassed the period before and after the release of “13 Reasons Why.”

The researchers found that the rates of suicide for 10 to 17 year old adolescents were significantly higher than in the months of April, June and December 2017 than were expected based on the data, according to the NIH. The increase translated into an additional estimated 195 suicide deaths between April 1, 2017 and Dec. 31, 2017.

The number of deaths by suicide recorded in April 2017 was greater than the number seen in any single month during the five-year period. Researchers also found that the increase in suicide rate was primarily driven by significant increases in suicide in young males, according to the NIH.

The observed suicide rate for March 2017, which is the month prior to the release of the the web series, was also higher than forecast, the NIH said. The researchers noted that the show was highly promoted in March 2017, which exposed audiences to the show's premise and content through trailers.

The researchers did not find any significant trends in suicide rates in people 18 to 64 years of age.

As a comparison, the study assessed the impact of the show's release on a control outcome of homicide deaths. It found that the release had no impact in the control analyses of homicide deaths within any age group. The lack of change in homicide rates during the period of interest “lends some strength to the idea that changes in suicide rates were influenced by the show” and not other environmental or social factors, the NIH said.

The research also has several limitations. The study used a quasi-experimental design, which means that the researchers cannot make a causal link between the release of the “13 Reasons Why” and the observed changes in suicide rates, the NIH said. Therefore, the researchers cannot rule out the possibility that unmeasured events or factors influenced suicide rates during this period.

The study's findings did add to a growing body of information suggesting that youth may be particularly sensitive to the way suicide is portrayed in popular entertainment and in the media, the NIH said. This increasing “ recognition of entertainment and media influence” has lead to groups including the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization and reporting on suicide.org (http://suicide.org/) to create best practices for talking about and portraying suicide on screen, according to the NIH.

For example, the guidelines recommend that entertainment media should avoid depicting the suicide method used. The media is also urged to convey the message that help is available and to include accurate information on how the public can seek help. The study should also serve as a reminder “to be mindful of the possible unintended impacts” of the media's portrayal of suicide and for it to use best practices.

The National Suicide Prevention line is 1-800-273-TALK (8255), and with Crisis Text Line, the public can text “home” to 741741.

The second season of “13 Reasons Why” was released in May 2018, while the third season is in production and expected to be released this year.

Keli Machado, 30, of North Port, died Friday of her injuries. Her husband, Jesus Machado, 36, died immediately.

The Jeep landed in a ditch, and Jesus Machado was ejected. Keli Machado was taken to Lee Memorial Hospital with serious injuries. Two boys, 8 and 11, received minor injuries. A 5-year-old girl was critically injured.

509,WENDY VICTORA: Some weather warnings better left unsaid,"It has long been a point of pride for me that I don't pretend to know what the weather will do until it arrives.

Forecasting, though based on science, rarely sticks to just the facts. When I do catch a television weather broadcast, whether local or one of the channels that is all weather all the time, I always feel faintly alarmed.

These reports seem to be heavy on drama, infused with fear-mongering and far more exciting than most weather has a right to be.

My exception has been hurricane season.

When there is a storm with the potential to come into the Gulf of Mexico, I turn to WeatherUnderground.com or the National Hurricane Center and I refresh often.

But I made an exception to my exception earlier this year when I was traveling often on weekends and bad weather followed me. There were tornado warnings in two of the three places I visited and both dense fog advisories and icy road advisories in the third. I literally woke up one morning to find the doors on my car iced shut and fog so thick I couldn't see the other cars on the road.

That's when I signed up for one of the weather services that sends alerts to my phone. My life has changed, but not for the better. From morning to night I am besieged by warnings. High winds, high surf, heavy rain fall. Dangerous rip currents. Conditions conducive to tornadoes. Actual tornado watches and warnings.

Alerts that thunderstorms are on the way, ""possibly severe,"" and capable of doing horrible things.

I am more than capable of imagining horrible things without any help from my phone or the script writers who have become the dark weather queens of our shaky kingdom.

There have been times when I looked down at my phone and found a full screen of alerts.

I get it.

Life is tough. Bad weather can be dangerous. Roofs blow off. Roads flood. Icy conditions cause wrecks. Fog makes driving challenging. Tornadoes are terrifying, especially to this Midwestern girl who grew up huddled in hallways waiting for the world to end.

But I'm going to start looking at my phone less.

Most days, everything I need to know I can tell by looking out the window or, more radical still, just stepping outside.

And everything I don't need to know? Better left unsaid.

<p>The employee said words were exchanged and store items were tossed around when one of the women picked a fight with her. </p>

<p>The chaos happened shortly after doors opened Thursday morning at Classy Girl Beauty Supply on Northeast 167th Street in North Miami Beach.</p>

<p>The salon specialist working at the time said two women, a customer and a former employee, started to make trouble inside the store and they were asked to leave.</p>

<p>""I'm defending myself because you threw something at me first, and then I react after that,"" the employee, who did not want to be identified, said. </p>

<p>The employee said she threw store equipment back at the customer and the customer then tossed a shopping basket before rushing deeper into the store and grabbing lipstick, other makeup items and perfume, which she began to throw behind the counter. </p>

<p>Before the customer walked out, the employee said, she grabbed the ""wet floor"" sign and hit the employee with it.  </p>

511,Police: Ex-youth pastor forced girl to have sex by threatening to report family to ICE,"0 Police: Ex-youth pastor forced girl to have sex by threatening to report family to ICE

PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. - A South Florida man who served as a youth pastor at a Broward County church is accused of having sex with a minor after threatening to turn her and her family into immigration authorities, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

>> Read more trending news

Luis Clarke, 38, of Pembroke Pines, was arrested Thursday morning and charged with 25 felony counts, including sexual battery of a minor and false imprisonment, according to court records.

The girl “never reported the sexual acts to her parents and went along with (Clarke’s) request because he threatened to report her and her family’s illegal status” to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, according to court records.

Clarke, who was a part-time youth pastor at the defunct Abrazo tu Sueno Church, in Pembroke Pines, allegedly began the sexual relationship with the victim in March 2016 when she was 16, the Sun-Sentinel reported. The victim told authorities the abuse continued through March 2017, the newspaper reported.

According to Pembroke Pines police, one of the sexual battery incidents at Clarke’s residence was witnessed by a 15-year-old boy, WPLG reported. Police said when he learned the boy was present, he turned on his home’s alarm system so neither juvenile could leave, the television station reported.

The boy reported the incident to police April 3, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

Clarke gave a sworn statement to authorities after his arrest and admitted to two sexual encounters with the girl, the newspaper reported. He told police the boy had been to his home but denied the minor had been there while he was having sex with the girl, Detective Alkie Lewis-Siminies wrote in a police report.

512,"'Our greatest concern': Youth pastor used immigration threats to rape girl, police say","A former youth pastor is behind bars after police say he sexually assaulted a teenage girl and forced a teenage boy to watch the unthinkable crime.

Pembroke Pines police arrested Luis Clarke, 38, after the victim came forward about the assaults that happened between August 2016 to February 2017, according to an arrest report.

""The level of coercion that this suspect used in order to victimize this young lady is just so egregious, it makes this crime that much more serious,” said Captain Al Xiques of the Pembroke Pines Police Department.

According to the report, the female victim told police Clarke sexually assaulted her about 20 times.

She was between 15 and 16 years old.

In the report, the former youth pastor of the now-closed Abraza Tu Sueño Church picked the teenage girl up from school and took her to his house.

In one instance, police say Clarke activated his home alarm system, so neither of the teens could leave.

""You never know who you're encountering, you never know who you're meeting,” Xiques said.

The teenage girl told police she didn’t report the assaults because Clarke threatened to report her and her families’ illegal status to authorities.

""Our greatest concern is that there are potentially additional victims in the community,"" Xiques said.

The church closed last year.

Police believe there could be more victims.

""We're asking the community, parents and guardians, if you know that your child has come into contact with Mr. Clarke at any point in time in the past, please speak to them and ask them, if at any time, they have has any inappropriate contact with Mr. Clarke,” Xiques said.",http://cw34.com/news/local/our-greatest-concern-youth-pastor-used-immigration-threats-to-rape-girl-police-say,2019-04-26T02:47:30Z,WTVX,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407
513,"Man accused killing parents, brother after paying Bulgarian call girl $200K granted $750K bail","0 Man accused killing parents, brother after paying Bulgarian call girl $200K granted $750K bail

SANFORD, Fla. - A 29-year-old man accused of a triple murder could be allowed to leave jail.

Grant Amato is accused of killing his parents and his brother at their home in January after a dispute about him sending $200,000 of the family's money to a Bulargian call girl.

Amato was granted a $750,000 bail Thursday afternoon.

TRENDING NOW:

Jared Shapiro, Amato's defense attorney, said Thursday that although it is unusual for a triple murder suspect to receive bail, his client is entitled to it because he has cooperated with investigators.

""He was unemployed at the time of his arrest, and we're not aware of any significant assets that he has to post bond,"" Shapiro said.

Prosecutors said they had sought a $25 million bail, because Amato is computer savvy, he could create fake travel documents and he faces the death penalty if he is convicted.

""(The call girl) certainly is one incentive for him to leave this country and go to Bulgaria,"" Assistant State Attorney Stewart Stone said.

Defense attorney Jeff Dowdy said he sought a $150,000 bail, because Amato did not flee after the slayings and he has cooperated with investigators.

""There is still no physical forensic evidence linking him to this crime,"" he said.

The judge asked if Amato can afford to pay his bail.

""We're going to explore that,"" Dowdy said. ""We know he does have family resources.""

If Amato is released after paying bail, he will be forbidden from leaving Central Florida and from accessing computers or the internet, and he must wear a GPS-enabled ankle monitor.

Berry told the girl ""you got to hold on to me and trust me"" when he reached her. However, as the two of them got closer to shore, a rip current started pulling them back out. He fought against it though, inching his way to the shore successfully.

Berry was not alone in his rescue efforts, as others on the beach saw what was going on and formed a human chain to get the girl back on dry land. For example, Eliza Dellert also put her own life in danger to deliver a float to the girl Berry was helping.

Both of these unlikley heroes said that they were just doing what they had to do. They also said that they hope someone would do the same thing for them.

519,Man accused of choking 9-year-old daughter outside Stock Island restaurant,"Scott Willand Alino, 47, of New Jersey, is accused of dragging his 9-year-old daughter from a restaurant in South Florida and choking her in the parking lot.

STOCK ISLAND, Fla. - A New Jersey man was arrested Tuesday night for choking his 9-year-old daughter in front of a Stock Island restaurant, authorities said.

According to Monroe County Sheriff's Office spokesman Adam Linhardt, deputies were called to the Hogfish Bar & Grill at 6810 Front St. around 7 p.m.

Authorities said an employee saw Scott Willand Alino, 47, drag his daughter to the parking lot and then choke her to the point that the employee feared the girl was losing consciousness.

Linhardt said the employee confronted Alino and the girl broke free from her father and ran back into the restaurant.

The employee told deputies that Alino physically threatened him. The employee then called 911.

According to Linhardt, responding deputies saw that the girl's neck was red, but Alino claimed his daughter was misbehaving and he just placed his hand on her shoulder and neck area.

Authorities said the father also added that he didn't need anyone telling him how to raise his children.

Three witnesses in the restaurant told deputies they also saw Alino drag his daughter to the parking lot and choke her.

Linhardt said the employee and witnesses' statements were corroborated by surveillance video from the restaurant.

Alino was arrested on a charge of child neglect without causing great bodily harm.

521,"Florida man gave alcohol to teens before deadly DUI crash, police say","Related Headlines Teen dies, driver arrested after SUV crash

- A Florida man was arrested for supplying alcohol to teenagers, who were later involved in a deadly DUI crash in North Port, police announced.

North Port police arrested 22-year-old Damien Chanfrante after learning he provided alcohol on the night of the crash. Early Saturday morning, 19-year-old Stephanie Evrard was driving an SUV, missed a turn and crashed in the area of Joewood Circle and Genip Court. At the time, there were a total of 13 people inside the vehicle and on the roof.

The vehicle rolled over, ejecting a 17-year-old girl. Investigators said the SUV rolled on top of that passenger, and she passed away at the scene. Three other injured teens, ages 13, 17, and 19 were transported to nearby hospitals. Evrard was arrested for DUI manslaughter and three DUI with personal injury.

North Port authorities said the number of DUI arrests this year are up by 207 percent.

“We have a renewed effort to keep drunk drivers off our roadways,” according to a statement by the police department. “We are also working to educate and enforce underage alcohol possession and underage drinking and driving. Along with our enforcement and education efforts, we ask that parents continue to educate their teens and that our community members make responsible decisions to not drink and drive, as we have a zero-tolerance policy on those that do.”

528,Budget leads major issues in Legislature's last week,"TALLAHASSEE — The Florida Legislature careens into its final scheduled week with a host of major issues still to be settled, including a roughly $90 billion state budget that is the only bill lawmakers are required to pass.

House Speaker Jose Oliva said an agreement on the budget should be reached by Tuesday, giving legislators the required 72-hour ""cooling off"" period to read and digest it before a final vote. Friday is the scheduled end of the 60-day legislative session.

""We're on time. We like the position we're in now,"" said Oliva, a Miami Lakes Republican.

As in any other year, most bills filed by lawmakers will wither away. But there are several high-profile issues that have passed either the House or Senate and must be reconciled before they can be sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis to become law.

One of those is the ""sanctuary cities"" bill that would require local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal authorities on detaining undocumented immigrants and ban local governments from enacting policies that would protect them. The House has passed its version but compromise with the Senate remains elusive.

Other big-ticket items yet to be finalized or discarded include: creating a new private school voucher program, authorizing a Canadian prescription drug importation program, permitting more classroom teachers to carry weapons, implementing a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights for most ex-felons, making texting while driving a primary traffic offense, beginning to build three major toll highways in rural areas, allowing hemp to become a crop and requiring parental consent for a minor girl to get an abortion.

In other words, welcome to the final week of the Legislature.

The one major accomplishment so far is a measure that allows smokable forms of medical marijuana, which DeSantis signed into law in March. That aligned state law with a constitutional amendment passed overwhelmingly by voters in 2016 and overturned a law signed in 2017 by then-Gov. Rick Scott that prohibited smoking medical weed.

Oliva said sometimes it takes legislators a while to come around on major issues. The texting and driving ban bill, for example, seems simple given the plague of distracted driving crashes, but many African American lawmakers worry it could be used by law enforcement officers to disproportionately stop drivers of color.

""That's another one that has taken a long time to kind of mature because of the challenge of who will be pulled over and giving authorities another reason to pull people over,"" the speaker said.

One potential last-minute issue is whether Florida will renew its revenue-sharing compact with the Seminole Tribe, which has paid the state $350 million a year in return for exclusive rights to certain forms of gambling. The current compact expires May 31 and lawmakers aren't counting on the money this year, but Senate President Bill Galvano said it's possible a new agreement will be reached between DeSantis and the tribe after meetings Friday.

""At the end of the day, it is up to him to make the agreement with the Seminole Tribe but we have a role of ratification,"" said Galvano, a Bradenton Republican. ""These things take time. Any movement is positive.""

The budget talks, as usual, focus on big multibillion-dollar things like public education, health care, the environment and criminal justice — but they also include a myriad of smaller items, such as whether to allow the Visit Florida tourism office to expire in October under current law. The Senate has voted to reauthorize it, but lawmakers so far have agreed only to provide $19 million for the upcoming year, enough to allow it to close up shop.

DeSantis sought full funding of $76 million. The Senate initially suggested $50 million, while the House was adamant about only the minimal amount. Oliva, however, seems resigned to keeping the office alive another year, mainly because the governor wants it.

""The governor's office has expressed a desire to have it continue to go forward so that he would have the opportunity to make an assessment of his own of how unnecessary it is,"" the speaker said. ""I don't know about fully funding it.""

Dozens of other items will be caught up in the final week's budget scramble, and DeSantis has line-item veto authority once it is passed. One thing he might want to keep is a nearly $4 million appropriation for a new state airplane to replace the hand-me-down one the governor currently uses.

The new budget will take effect July 1.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190427/budget-leads-major-issues-in-legislatures-last-week?rssfeed=true,2019-04-27T15:30:10Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
531,"Viewpoint: Adopt greyhounds, make fast friends","Buy Photo Marlette's Florida Election Cartoons (Photo: Andy Marlette, amarlette@pnj.com)

Have you ever rescued a greyhound? If not, you’re missing out on a gentle companion that could change both of your lives for the better.

Florida’s recent election allowed voters to decide if greyhound racing should be banned.

The voters spoke.

Greyhound racing in Florida will be phased out by Dec 31, 2020.

So what does this mean? It means that commercial dog racing will no longer be in operation. It also means that other forms of gambling at these dog tracks will not be affected (slots and card games).

I am thrilled the ban passed because I have rescued greyhounds, and I know the tales behind the tails.

When I lived in Florence, AL, I vacationed here along the panhandle, more specifically, Destin. The people I traveled with at the time loved going to the Ebro Greyhound Racing Park and Poker Room in Ebro, FL. I didn’t care about the racing part but loved going to pet the greyhounds. They usually had a couple out that you could go visit.

Granted, this was many years ago and I wasn’t sure how I felt about greyhounds being used as racing dogs for entertainment. I did not know how they were treated, and they all looked a little malnourished.

One good thing I can say about this particular track is that they promoted adoption. Because of my few visits to the park, I became involved with greyhound adoption.

After careful consideration, I adopted my first greyhound back in 1997. Her racing name was Laurel, but I quickly changed it to Maggie. She was a black, beautiful girl with a gentle disposition and loving personality.

She wasn’t a good racer and was only two-years-old when I adopted her. The reasoning for this was because she did not make her owners any money. So, instead of allowing her to be euthanized, I made her a member of my family. I didn’t care that her teeth were in horrible shape due to the high protein foods she was fed at the track; I loved her all the same.

She lived to the age of seven, sadly passing away from kidney failure while I held her in my arms. Putting her down was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, but it was comforting knowing that I gave her a chance at life—a life of being spoiled, plenty of hugs and kisses, long walks and a big backyard to run in.

Some argue that greyhounds enjoy their racing lifestyle. Obviously I am not a greyhound, so I wouldn’t know.

What I do know is that Maggie did not have to be in a kennel for 23 hours a day, and she did not have to chase a fake rabbit that she never had a chance to catch, risking injury in the process.

Before Maggie passed, I adopted a big, beautiful 4-year-old gray boy named Maverick. Maverick was a sure fire bet back in his heyday; he made his owners money in the many races he won, as well as the people that bet on him. However, when Maverick tore his right shoulder muscle during a race, he was no longer any use to his owners, so he was put up for adoption.

He could have easily been put down, but thanks to the greyhound adoption program, I was able to adopt him and give him a loving home. He also gained a sister to share his retired racing life with.

There is a slogan that refers to retired greyhounds as “couch potatoes.” Maverick eased into his role as a retired racer as easily as a puppy eases into a warm blanket. He had a big backyard where he could run his laps. Afterward, he curled up in his favorite oversized leather chair.

He was not put into a crate with little to no interaction.

Maverick sadly passed at the age of nine, but he fully enjoyed his retired life. I take comfort in that.

Declining revenue and concerns of animal cruelty have caused 40 states to ban the sport. Florida was one of the last states to hold out, however, Florida is home to twelve of the tracks in the U.S., so this amendment passing was a huge victory for those that oppose it.

Scare tactics were used leading up to the election; those against the ban claimed that 8,000 greyhounds would be euthanized because they will have nowhere else to go. When Massachusetts banned the sport in January of 2010, there was a record for adoptions in the state (according to state records).

I say to you all: There are plenty of adoption programs out there that will take these dogs in. The adoption process ensures that they greyhounds are placed in the right homes, so you can rest assured that your new best friend is a perfect fit.

I cannot recommend adopting a greyhound enough. They are so sweet and gentle, and training them is a breeze. They are already kennel trained, so all that is required is weaning them out of their kennels and into your home.

PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - As execution day for serial killer Bobby Joe Long nears, Allen Allweiss reflects on the man he knew, the man he prosecuted as an assistant state attorney with the Pinellas Pasco State Attorney's Office.

He calls long the definition of evil.

""His eyes would glaze over. He would start talking about it in normal conversation tones. And then you could see a film coming over his eyes like a devil as he got into describing how he would do these things,"" said Allweiss.

""You know he would choke them out, cut their throat and all of this business.""

Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a death warrant for Long, one of the most notorious serial killers in Tampa Bay, according to a letter from the governor.

It's the first execution the governor has ordered since taking office in January. It's been set for May 23 at 6 p.m.

DeSantis wants Long, now 65, to be put to death for the 1984 murder of Michelle Simms, who vanished after Long picked her up on Kennedy Boulevard in Tampa.

The following year, Long pleaded guilty to seven additional first-degree murder charges and numerous charges for sexual batteries and kidnappings, according to a letter from Attorney General Ashley Moody.

All eight murders occurred in Hillsborough County.

Long also has convictions and other charges out of Pinellas and Pasco counties and in total, investigators have tied him to at least 10 killings.

""Bobby Joe Long is not remorseful,"" said Gary Terry, a retired colonel with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office and one of the lead investigators during Long's reign of terror.

""The only thing he is sorry about is that he got caught.""

Allweiss prosecuted Long for killing Virginia Johnson in Pasco County. Allweiss recalls he was remorseless for what he had done.

""He was an absolute sicko. He is an arrogant son of a b. He was an arrogant guy. He used to go, his big start was rapes,"" said Allweiss.

""He would answer ads where the parents were trying to sell their baby furniture. So he would go to the house hoping to find the little girl or the mommy there.""

Allweiss feels for the families of the victims who've waited decades for justice.

""Thirty-five years waiting for justice. It's long. Too long.""

He adds, the day Long finally meets his maker, will be a good one.

538,"Man accused of killing parents, brother after paying Bulgarian call girl $200K granted bail","0 Man accused of killing parents, brother after paying Bulgarian call girl $200K granted bail

SANFORD, Fla. - A 29-year-old man accused in the death of three family members could be allowed to leave jail.

Grant Amato is accused of killing his parents and his brother at their home in January after a dispute about him sending $200,000 of the family's money to a Bulgargian call girl.

Amato was granted a $750,000 bail Thursday afternoon.

TRENDING NOW:

Jared Shapiro, Amato's defense attorney, said Thursday that although it is unusual for a suspect in three killings to receive bail, his client is entitled to it because he has cooperated with investigators.

""He was unemployed at the time of his arrest, and we're not aware of any significant assets that he has to post bond,"" Shapiro said.

Prosecutors said they had sought a $25 million bail because Amato is computer savvy and could create fake travel documents. They also cited the fact that he faces the death penalty if he is convicted.

""(The call girl) certainly is one incentive for him to leave this country and go to Bulgaria,"" Assistant State Attorney Stewart Stone said.

Defense attorney Jeff Dowdy said he sought a $150,000 bail because Amato did not flee after the slayings and he has cooperated with investigators.

""There is still no physical forensic evidence linking him to this crime,"" he said.

The judge asked whether Amato can afford to pay his bail.

""We're going to explore that,"" Dowdy said. ""We know he does have family resources.""

If Amato is released after paying bail, he will be forbidden from leaving Central Florida and from accessing computers or the internet, and he must wear a GPS-enabled ankle monitor.

539,"Blood-sucking 'kissing bug' reported in southern US, moving north","ATLANTA - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed a 2018 case in which a blood-sucking insect known as a ""kissing bug"" bit a child in the face.

In July 2018, the family requested help from the Delaware Division of Public Health and the Delaware Department of Agriculture to identify an insect that had bitten their daughter's face while she was watching television in her bedroom at night because they were ""concerned about possible disease transmission from the insect,"" the CDC announced last week.

The family, who lives in an older home in a heavily wooded area in Kent County, said at the time they had not recently traveled outside the area, and a window air conditioning unit was located in the girl's bedroom, according to the CDC.

Delaware officials preliminarily identified the insect as the ""blood-sucking"" kissing bug, or Triatoma sanguisuga, which feeds on animals and humans and have a habit of biting humans in the face, according to the CDC. Texas A&M University's Kissing Bug Citizen Science Program, a research program that documents and collects kissing bugs from across the U.S., identified the insect through a photograph.

The bug was also sent to the CDC, which then confirmed that the species was present in Delaware. Previously, a report of a suspected kissing bug in Kent County was sent to Texas A&M, which confirmed the bug via photograph, but a local institution in Delaware had initially identified the insect as a milkweed bug instead and destroyed the evidence before the university could examine it for further confirmation, according to the CDC.

The bug can transmit a parasite known as Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes a disease known as Chagas.

About 300,000 in the U.S. and 8 million people in Central and South America are living with Chagas, but only a few cases of the disease caused by contact with the kissing bug have been documented, according to the CDC. The rare parasitic disease can lead to heart failure or stroke, but the parasite can hide in the body for decades and most people who are infected do not develop any signs or symptoms.

Initial symptoms may include fever, fatigue, body aches, headache and rash, as well as local swelling where the bite occurred and the parasite entered the body. It is treated with an anti-trypanosomal medication, which is only available through the CDC.

The girl who was bitten in 2018 did not suffer any effects, according to the CDC.

To prevent infestation by the kissing bug, the CDC advises homeowners to place outdoor lights away from the home, dog kennels and chicken coops and to turn them off when they are not in use. Homeowners should also remove trash, wood and rock piles away from the home, clear out any bird and animal nests near the home and consider consulting a licensed pest control professional. In addition, cracks and gaps around windows, air conditions, walls, roofs, doors and crawl spaces should be inspected and sealed, chimney flues should be tightly closed when not in use and screens should be placed on all doors and windows.

The CDC also suggests that pets sleep indoors, especially at night, and that all pet resting areas be kept clean.

Natural breeding wasn't successful so a special team of reproductive specialists for endangered species came from the South East Zoo Alliance for Reproduction and Conservation.

The Miami Herald reports the crew artificially collected semen from the father in January. They artificially inseminated the mother the next day.

The expectant mother had been under 24-hour observation leading up to the birth.

Zoo officials said there are less than 3,000 Indian rhinos left in the wild.

541,It's one month since Layla Aiken was killed waiting at a school bus stop in Cape Coral,"CLOSE The father of Layla Aiken, Glenn Aiken, speaks to reporters after the memorial for his daughter. Andrea Melendez, Fort Myers News-Press

EarlyMarch 25, an 8-year-old girl sat with her older twin brothers at her school bus stop, waiting in the dark to go to school.

It would have been Layla Aiken's first day back at school after the spring time changed, leaving the trio in the dark. Layla wouldn't make it to her school that day, or any day afterward.

The girl was killed when a red pickup struck her at Northeast 19th Terrace and Northeast Third Avenue in Cape Coral.

Her death launched a movement, raising nearly $175,000, rallied a community, and engaged the Lee County Schools District, while her killer remains free.

Layla's mother, Kathleen Aiken, has not responded to interview requests about what the support means to her. She previously told the News-Press that the community's response makes it clear her only daughter didn't die in vain.

In a recent Facebook post about the community coming together to build benches and set them out at school bus stops, she wrote:

""Look at all those precious children my sweet girl has inspired my amazing community to keep safe!! Mummy misses you every second buggy girl and I may not be able to feel you in my arms again Lay but my goodness is EVERYONE feeling you in their hearts.""

In many of her posts, Aiken seems to be encouraging her ""Buggy Girl"" to ""keep talking"" and spurring change in the community.

Here's what the movement has accomplished so far:

Lights for Layla

A group of women close with Layla's mother organized fundraisers and dubbed their cause Lights for Layla. They said funds raised would go toward installing street lights and benches at school bus stops.

The Lights for Layla fundraiser was held Saturday in Cape Coral to raise money and awareness for safer bus stops after Layla Aiken was killed by a hit-and-run driver at her bus stop. (Photo: Amanda Inscore/The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

The first fundraiser, a carnival-themed event for kids the first Saturday after Layla's death, raised about $4,000 in cash and another $2,000 from participating vendors.

Local businesses got involved in the fundraising effort, including a Chick-il-A franchise and Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Fort Myers.

A Facebook fundraiser created by the group netted more than $65,000 in donations. Local fundraisers continue taking place, with one scheduled Saturday at Dixie Roadhouse in Cape Coral.

Lights for Layla members swarmed a Cape Coral City Council meeting April 1 and pleaded for increased safety measures at school bus stops.

The Rotary Club of Cape Coral said the organization plans on working with other organizations and donors to install more benches at school bus stops in the city, and that the club has the capability and resources to do so.

The Lee County Sheriff's Office also partnered with community members to raise $100,000 for flashing LED lights that will fasten to students' backpacks by the next school year. The sheriff's office pledged $20,000 and the Lee County School District pledged $10,000.

Big Mama and the Wild Bunch at FM radio station B103.9 was also involved in the fundraiser.

The sheriff's office established a nonprofit called ""Compassionate Cops"" to manage the donations and help purchase the lights.The office did not have an updated amount raised available for release.

Numerous residents who live near school bus stops set out benches in their yards, and groups of people got together to build benches and picnic tables. The Lee County School District is working with the community to install the benches and determine the proper placement for them.

Another group, Benches for our Babes, has distributed benches for students while they wait for the bus as well.

The crash investigation

One day after the incident, authorities had seized the pickup truck they believe was involved in the crash and developed a person of interest. Investigators with the Cape Coral Police Department are still investigating the crash, and have yet to make an arrest.

The department is also working with the state attorney's office on the investigation.

If you believe you have video or other information about this case, you can contact the Cape Coral Police Department at 239-574-3223 or submit an anonymous tip here. You can also text a tip to CRIMES (274637) by including ""CCPD+"" before your message.

Town halls

The School District of Lee County had a town hall meeting April 16 to address the community's concerns. About 50 people attended and dozens presented their ideas for increased safety measures.

The school district and Cape Coral Police pledged to analyze the school bus stop where Layla was hit. It was deemed safe according to current guidelines.

The district moved Layla's school bus stops and changed the bus routes so her brothers would not have to return to the spot where they watched their sister die. The district did the same for Alana Tamplin's siblings earlier this year. Alana, 12, was killed in January by a driver near her home in North Fort Myers.

The district transports 49,000 students every day.

There are nearly 7,000 school bus stops in Lee County, with 1,671 in Cape Coral. The district is identifying those that could become semi-permanent stops, rather than changing location every school year.

Longer term, the district is considering a proximity-based choice system where elementary parents would choose between the four to six schools closest to their home, instead of multiple. This would impact stops, ride lengths and possibly school start times, according to Superintendent Greg Adkins.

The district said it is working with municipalities and community groups to place benches and lighting at other stops. The district has created an email address where the community can suggest more ideas for safety improvements: busstopsafety@leeschools.net.

And on the district's website, a new page was created to provide more safety information when walking and biking to and from bus stops.

Layla's mother has argued that Layla was not walking to her stop. She was already there.

The district says it is not responsible for students until they're on the bus.

Students are told where to stand at the beginning of the school year, but the district has no way to enforce it.

Rob Spicker, the school district's spokesman, identified what he said are the two things that matter the most: supervision at the bus stop and drivers paying attention.

""It is also a community issue,"" Spicker said. ""We need lights from electric companies and sidewalks from the municipalities. Every piece of the puzzle has a part to play.""

551,"Rabbi's hands are shattered in fatal attack on Calif. synagogue, says gun 'miraculously' jammed","- In the minutes after the gunman fled the scene of a shooting that killed a woman inside a Southern California synagogue, a wounded Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein wrapped his bloodied hand in a prayer shawl, stood on a chair and addressed the panicked congregation, vowing to stay strong in the face of the deadly attack targeting his community.

""We are a Jewish nation that will stand tall. We will not let anyone take us down. Terrorism like this will not take us down,"" Goldstein recalled telling his congregants after the gunfire erupted Saturday at Chabad of Poway.

Congregant Lori Kaye, 60, was killed in the shooting, which injured Goldstein, 8-year-old Noya Dahan and her 34-year-old uncle, Almog Peretz, authorities said. Hours after the three wounded were released from hospitals, Goldstein described the onslaught at a news conference Sunday outside the synagogue north of San Diego.

Goldstein said he was preparing for a service on the last day of Passover, a holiday celebrating freedom, and heard a loud sound. He turned around, and a saw a young man wearing sunglasses standing in front of him with a rifle.

""I couldn't see his eyes. I couldn't see his soul,"" Goldstein said. He raised his hands and lost one of his fingers in the shooting.

And then, Goldstein said, ""miraculously the gun jammed.""

The attack Saturday came exactly six months after a mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue.

John T. Earnest, 19, surrendered to police after bursting into the synagogue and opening fire as about 100 people were worshipping inside.

Earnest, who had no previous contact with law enforcement, may face a hate crime charge in addition to homicide charges when he's arraigned later this week, San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said. He was being held without bail, and it was unclear if he had an attorney. Police searched Earnest's house and said he was also being investigated in connection with an arson attack on a mosque in nearby Escondido, California, on March 24.

The 8-year-old victim said she had just finished praying and was getting ready to go play with other children when gunshots rang out. Her uncle rushed her and the other children outside, the girl said.

Her leg was bleeding but doctors told her she didn't need surgery, she said.

""I was scared, really, really scared,"" she said. ""I didn't see my dad. I thought he was dead.""

Her father, 32-year-old Israel Dahan, said he flipped over a folding table as soon as he saw the man enter carrying a long rifle and told people to run. He went to look for his children and found two had been ushered out and his 5-year-old was hiding in the bathroom, he said.

There were indications an AR-type assault weapon might have malfunctioned after the gunman fired numerous rounds inside, Gore said. An off-duty Border Patrol agent fired at the shooter as he fled, missing him but striking his getaway vehicle, the sheriff said.

Shortly after fleeing, Earnest called 911 to report the shooting, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said. When an officer reached him on a roadway, ""the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" he said.

Friends described Kaye as giving, warm and attentive to community members on their birthdays and when they were sick. A wife and mother, she loved gardening and made delicious challah for her family and friends, said Roneet Lev, 55.

Goldstein described her as a pioneering founding member of the congregation and said he was heartbroken by her death. He said the attack could have harmed many more people had the shooter turned toward the sanctuary where so many were praying.

""Lori took the bullet for all of us,"" the rabbi said, his hands wrapped in bandages. ""She didn't deserve to die.""

He said that Kaye's physician husband was called to tend to a wounded worshipper and fainted when he realized it was his wife.

When the gunfire erupted, another worshipper, Shimon Abitbul, said he immediately placed his 2-year-old grandson on the floor and waited for a break in the shooting to grab the boy and sprint away.

Then Abitbul ran back to the shooting scene to try to help a woman he described as having a hole in her chest and who later died, he said Sunday.

Abitbul, who was visiting from Israel and staying with his daughter and her family in Southern California, said he was still coming to grips with the carnage.

""All of us are human beings,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter if you are Jews or Christians or Muslims.""

Peretz, who was wounded in the leg, said he turned around after hearing gunfire and saw the shooter standing by the door. He grabbed his niece by the hand and carried out another child.

He then saw a group of children and got them running, ""I tell them, 'go this way, go this way,"" said Peretz, who is visiting from Israel.

Gore said authorities were reviewing Earnest's social media posts, including what he described as a ""manifesto."" There was no known threat after Earnest was arrested, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship Saturday and again on Sunday as a precaution, police said.

A person identifying himself as John Earnest posted an anti-Jewish screed online about an hour before the attack. The poster described himself as a nursing school student and praised the suspects accused of carrying out deadly attacks on mosques in New Zealand last month that killed 50 and at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, in which 11 people were killed.

""It was a hate crime, no doubt about it,"" national security adviser John Bolton said on ""Fox News Sunday."" He said investigators have not seen any connection between the suspect and other extremist groups.

California State University, San Marcos, confirmed that Earnest was a student who was on the dean's list and said the school was ""dismayed and disheartened"" that he was suspected in ""this despicable act.""""

Goldstein said President Donald Trump called him to share condolences on behalf of the American people.

The White House acknowledged the call. ""The President expressed his love for the Jewish people and the entire community of Poway,"" Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement.

Several dozen people, many wearing black, gathered on a street corner in Poway Sunday to show their support for the victims and congregation and to call for an end to hate and violence.

They carried signs reading ""no more killing"" and ""Shalom."" A young boy sat with a cardboard sign reading ""we must do better"".

Deb Lira, 71, of San Diego, said she was angry and sickened by the attack in what has long been a peaceful community.

""I'm here because I'm Jewish and this is my message,"" she said, pointing to a sign that read ""never again"" and ""never forget.""

""I will not be silent,"" she said.

552,Budget leads major issues in Legislature,"TALLAHASSEE — The Florida Legislature careens into its final scheduled week with a host of major issues still to be settled, including a roughly $90 billion state budget that is the only bill lawmakers are required to pass.

House Speaker Jose Oliva said an agreement on the budget should be reached by Tuesday, giving legislators the required 72-hour “cooling off” period to read and digest it before a final vote. Friday is the scheduled end of the 60-day legislative session.

“We’re on time. We like the position we’re in now,” said Oliva, a Miami Lakes Republican.

As in any other year, most bills filed by lawmakers will wither away. But there are several high-profile issues that have passed either the House or Senate and must be reconciled before they can be sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis to become law.

One of those is the “sanctuary cities” bill that would require local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal authorities on detaining undocumented immigrants and ban local governments from enacting policies that would protect them. The House has passed its version, but compromise with the Senate remains elusive.

Other big-ticket items yet to be finalized or discarded include: creating a new private school voucher program, authorizing a Canadian prescription drug importation program, permitting more classroom teachers to carry weapons, implementing a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights for most ex-felons, making texting while driving a primary traffic offense, beginning to build three major toll highways in rural areas, allowing hemp to become a crop and requiring parental consent for a minor girl to get an abortion.

In other words, welcome to the final week of the Legislature.

The one major accomplishment so far is a measure that allows smokable forms of medical marijuana, which DeSantis signed into law in March. That aligned state law with a constitutional amendment passed overwhelmingly by voters in 2016 and overturned a law signed in 2017 by then-Gov. Rick Scott that prohibited smoking medical weed.

Oliva said sometimes it takes legislators a while to come around on major issues. The texting and driving ban bill, for example, seems simple given the plague of distracted driving crashes, but many African-American lawmakers worry it could be used by law enforcement officers to disproportionately stop drivers of color.

“That’s another one that has taken a long time to kind of mature because of the challenge of who will be pulled over and giving authorities another reason to pull people over,” the speaker said.

One potential last-minute issue is whether Florida will renew its revenue-sharing compact with the Seminole Tribe, which has paid the state $350 million a year in return for exclusive rights to certain forms of gambling. The current compact expires May 31, and lawmakers aren’t counting on the money this year, but Senate President Bill Galvano said it’s possible a new agreement will be reached between DeSantis and the tribe after meetings Friday.

“At the end of the day, it is up to him to make the agreement with the Seminole Tribe, but we have a role of ratification,” said Galvano, a Bradenton Republican. “These things take time. Any movement is positive.”

The budget talks, as usual, focus on big multibillion-dollar things like public education, health care, the environment and criminal justice — but they also include a myriad of smaller items, such as whether to allow the Visit Florida tourism office to expire in October under current law. The Senate has voted to reauthorize it, but lawmakers so far have agreed to provide only $19 million for the upcoming year, enough to allow it to close up shop.

DeSantis sought full funding of $76 million. The Senate initially suggested $50 million, while the House was adamant about only the minimal amount. Oliva, however, seems resigned to keeping the office alive another year, mainly because the governor wants it.

“The governor’s office has expressed a desire to have it continue to go forward so that he would have the opportunity to make an assessment of his own of how unnecessary it is,” the speaker said. “I don’t know about fully funding it.”

Dozens of other items will be caught up in the final week’s budget scramble, and DeSantis has line-item veto authority once it is passed. One thing he might want to keep is a nearly $4 million appropriation for a new state airplane to replace the hand-me-down one the governor currently uses.

The new budget will take effect July 1.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190427/budget-leads-major-issues-in-legislature?rssfeed=true,2019-04-27T14:49:41Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236
553,Child dies after allergic reaction to toothpaste that contained milk protein,"- A young girl from West Covina, California, died after an allergic reaction to toothpaste. Denise Saldate, 11, suffered a fast-moving anaphylactic reaction to milk protein found in the toothpaste. The family says it was an ingredient in a new toothpaste prescribed by her dentist that sent Denise into anaphylactic shock. She was rushed to the hospital, but she died. The coroner called her death “accidental.”

Denise’s parents are now talking about her tragic death, trying to raise awareness that some non-food items might include allergens. The family says the girl’s dentist had recommended a new professional-use toothpaste, but unfortunately the toothpaste had a milk protein, and that’s what killed her.

There’s no denying the appeal of Denise Saldate. On her YouTube channel, she’s upbeat and charismatic. Her mother, Monique Altamirano, told FOX 11, “Denise was a ball of sunshine and would brighten up anybody’s day.”

Her father, Jose Saldate, added, “I know if I was having a bad day at work, she would know how to make me laugh.”

Earlier this week, Dr. David Michalik was on Good Day LA in Los Angeles and talked about this rare fatal allergy:



Her parents said Denise was always happy, even though her life wasn’t always typical. She had severe food allergies since birth, so her parents had to check food labels carefully. Even still, there would be some times that the food she ate would trigger an allergic reaction.

“She’d break out in hives. It was always the Benadryl or Hydroxyzine first, but if that didn’t work, give her the Epi, and if that doesn’t work, we’d take her to the emergency room,” Monique said. “In this case, everything happened so fast, it was Epi and 9-1-1 immediately.”

Beyond the grief, what has happened has put her parents on a mission to get better labeling on non-food items. Her mother says, “Our main concern was food. Toothpaste was never ever a threat to Denise, so what we’ve learned now is that it’s not mandated for non-food items to note allergens on their products.”

Denise’s family knows that the best part of her lives on. She was an organ donor, and her heart was placed with a 9-year-old child, and her parents are happy to know that her heart is beating still. The family also discovered how supportive strangers could be. They closed their GoFundMe campaign when they more than doubled their funding goal.

The packaging on the toothpaste did indicate there was a milk-derived ingredient, but Monique says it was quite tiny. The company has offered sympathy to the family and released this statement:

“We are aware of a story on social media and various press sites regarding MI Paste® ONE. Our heartfelt sympathies go out to the family for their devastating loss. GC America takes product labeling and product safety very seriously and our MI Paste® products have had an exceptional safety profile in North America since sales began in 2004. MI Paste® ONE packaging and tube specifically warn, on all four sides and on both the front and back of the tube, that it contains milk protein. We are continuing to look into this matter.”",http://www.fox35orlando.com/fast-five/child-dies-after-allergic-reaction-to-toothpaste-that-contained-milk-protein,2019-04-27T02:45:38Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
554,"CDC issues kissing bug warning, but experts say not to panic","- Love is in the air in Florida, but not in the traditional sense. It's the season for love bugs, known for flying in attached pairs.

Love bugs are relatively harmless, but there's another bug with a similarly cute nickname that can do real harm. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a warning about the so-called kissing bug, which is now present in Florida and all of the southern states.

The nickname comes from where they bite: People’s faces.

""They have sensors on their antenna that are like heat-seeking missiles, that tells the bug it's at our softer tissue of our body, and it can drill in, and suck our blood from there,"" said Dr. Deby Cassill, a biology professor at USF St. Petersburg.

Continue reading below

The CDC confirmed this type of bug bit a Delaware girl's face last July. Her home is near a wooded area, which Cassill says is the kissing bug's typical habitat.

“They tend to lay their eggs in damp wood, and damp soil,” Cassill said. “So if you have wood piles, make sure they're far away from the house.""

The bloodsuckers can spread a parasite that can cause Chagas disease, which if left untreated, can cause heart failure.

Floyd Shockley, one of the Smithsonian’s experts in entomology says yes, the bugs carry the disease, but there’s good news for Americans.

“There's no case of a human being bitten within the US and contracting the disease in the US,” Shockley said.

You don't get infected through the bite. Shockley says it defecates on the wound, which becomes itchy.

""As a natural reaction you reach up to scratch it, and you smear the feces across the wound,” Shockley said. “That's how the parasite gets into you.""

He says he doesn't want the public to panic.

""Not just every brownish black bug with orange stripes is going to be something to be concerned about,” he said.

And before you give the kissing bug the kiss of death, he says to check with an expert.

""There's lots of bugs that look very similar. You don't want to kill something just because it kind of looks like it. Always have it confirmed by an expert.""",http://www.fox13news.com/health/cdc-issues-kissing-bug-warning-but-experts-say-not-to-panic,2019-04-26T21:58:07Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609
556,'Born fighting': Parents of local March of Dimes ambassador share story of her premature birth,"On an April evening, Layla Gaskin is showing off her ballet moves at her Tallahassee home. Her baby sister erupts in laughter as Layla beams and twirls in circles around her.

The exuberant 5-year-old with the bright purple glasses is healthy and happy. She has come a long way from the NICU, where she spent much of the first year of her life.

It's why Layla and her parents Dykibra and General Gaskin will join the March of Dimes this Saturday for their fifth march.

""You get to meet so many other families who've been through what you've been through,"" Dykibra, 38, said. Over dinners, they've swapped stories with other locals who've had premature babies and become like a ""family.""

Layla is this year's Tallahassee March of Dimes ambassador. She was born premature at 23 weeks, a scant 1 pound, 4 ounces. Her parents were told she had a 5 to 10% chance of living.

The then-tiny baby couldn't breathe and had temperature regulation issues. The NICU was her home for seven months — four at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare and three at UF Health Shands Hospital.

It was a frightening time for the Gaskins. They remember their first call from the hospital to rush to the NICU. It was on Thanksgiving morning.

""It was kind of like a punch in the gut,"" said General, 39, a Florida State University IT manager.

When they got there, their baby girl was on an oscillator, swollen and gray.

""It was scary. We did have some times when we didn't know if we were going to have a baby to take home,"" said Dykibra, WIC program director at the Florida Department of Health.

Dykibra prayed and pumped milk to cope.

""I feel like my ability to give her my milk — I felt like that was the one thing I could control,"" she said. ""It made me feel like I was doing something to help her.""

Monday will mark five years since the day Layla was discharged from Shands.

""We drove so fast home,"" Dykibra remembered, sharing a laugh with General. She road in the backseat by Layla while her husband zoomed home.

""What was I doing?"" Layla pauses from play and chimes in.

""You were sleeping in the car seat,"" her mom replied.

Now, Layla loves playing hopscotch, tag with her sister and dancing. She pretends to slip on her ballet slippers and demonstrates an arabesque ballet move.

In Leon County, 344 babies were born premature in 2017, according to Florida Department of Health data. Statewide, the number was about 22,800 babies for a premature birth rate of about 10%.

So far, the family's #TeamLayla has raised $2,063 for the March of Dimes, which funds research and awareness campaigns about premature births.

General said the struggle infused him and Dykibra with more faith and patience.

""Once you go through an experience like that, you kind of realize that you're not in control of a lot of things,"" he said.

Dykibra said it also cultivated strength.

""They're born fighting to stay alive,"" Dykibra said about premature babies. ""It just kind of made me feel like since my baby's fighting so hard, I'm going to not give up on her, and advocate for her.""

557,Review: Country star Kelsea Ballerini brings 'Miss Me More' tour to sold-out Hertz Arena in Estero,"CLOSE The 25-year-old Knoxville native sang her hits during her ""Miss Me More"" tour stop in Estero. Ashley Collins, ashley.collins@naplesnews.com; 239-213-6029

Country music star Kelsea Ballerini is unapologetically herself, even while performing her first arena-headlining tour at the sold-out Hertz Arena on Thursday night.

Wearing a fiery red outfit with knee-high boots and an equally high ponytail, the 25-year-old Knoxville native commanded attention when she first hit the stage with her girl power anthem ""Miss Me More.""

""I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings

Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you

Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more (I miss me more)""

Country-pop singer, Kelsea Ballerini brought her first arena-headlining tour ""Miss Me More"" to Hertz Arena in Estero, FL, April 25, 2019. The concert was sold out. (Photo: Staff Photo by Andrea Melendez)

The hit song also happens to be the name of Ballerini's 14-city tour, which kicked off April 11 in Maryland and features two Florida stops, including St. Augustine.

Coming up at Hertz: ZZ Top to play at Hertz Arena for 50th anniversary tour with Cheap Trick. Tickets on sale this week.

Ballerini was joined by country newcomer Brandon Ratcliff, who performed a 15-minute set, and Brett Young, who had nearly every female concertgoer swooning as he sung his No. 1 single on Billboard's Country Airplay chart, ""Here Tonight.""

Young, who's from California, had the crowd going for nearly an hour with his Cali-country hits, and it seemed as though concertgoers couldn't possibly get more excited until Ballerini took to the stage.

She sang several tracks from her latest album “Unapologetically,” including her cheeky “Get Over Yourself” and her more reflective tracks “Machine Heart” and “Legends.” She also performed songs off her first album ""The First Time,"" including “Dibs,” “Love Me Like You Mean It” and “Peter Pan.” She closed the show with a high-energy performance of “This Feeling,” a mainstream pop song she and The Chainsmokers collaborated on.

Hot off her sophomore album ""Unapologetically,"" to say Ballerini's musical career is on fire is an understatement. She was recently inducted as the newest and youngest current member of the Grand Ole Opry by one of country's leading ladies, Carrie Underwood.

In between songs, Ballerini spoke from the heart, sharing intimate stories behind ""Unapologetically,"" which she said she recorded while she was going through her first real breakup and growing into her own as a woman. She also shared how excited she was to receive the honor from the Grand Ole Opry earlier this month.

""It's the peak of life,"" she told the crowd, then joking that it could only go downhill from here. ""It was the biggest honor of all time.""

Ballerini, now a two-time Grammy nominated artist, moved to Nashville with her mom when she was only 15 to pursue a music career. She dedicated ""In Between,"" a song off her latest album, to her mom, who was in the crowd Thursday night for the three-hour show, along with Ballerini's Australian singer-songwriter hubby Morgan Evans.

But it was the fans Ballerini kept coming back to.

""Thank you for making a 15-year-old girl's wish come true,"" she told concertgoers before stepping off the stage and walking around the arena to take selfies and shake hands with fans while singing her hit song ""Love Me Like You Mean It.""

Ballerini is a force to be reckoned with not just in country radio but the music industry in general. In the past she's opened for some of country's biggest acts like Alan Jackson, Lady Antebellum, Tim McGraw, Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban. Now that she finally has her own tour she can show off how versatile she is as an artist. She can go from country to pop and isn't afraid to cross genres.

And she also isn't afraid to strap on a guitar or play the drums when the occasion arises. She was completely in her element when it was just her and the mic. A couple of times she took a break from skipping around the stage to autograph posters all while still singing.

She's definitely on her way and while there's no telling what Ballerini will do next, one thing is for certain: She won't apologize for being herself.

558,"TheatreZone dances, sings, smiles its way off season","The cast performs the musical review of Kander and Ebb songs from Cabaret, Chicago and other musicals at G&L Theatre in Naples on Monday, April 22, 2019. (Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Of course you'll walk away from ""And the World Goes 'Round"" at TheatreZone humming your favorite John Kander-Fred Ebb tunes. But the ones you don't know steal the show.

The five singers-dancers-actors do a hilarious diatribe to life on the treadmill with ""Coffee in a Cardboard Cup,"" adding jitters and speed as they gulp and the song flies on. While you may not be singing ""Yes"" on the way home, it's a sunny spirit lift, with a bouyant beat to match its chipper lyrics:

There's lots of chaff, there's lots of wheat

You might get mugged as you walk the streets

But on the other hand you might reach

That handsome stranger you've longed to meet

Both of the above songs are from a long-forgotten musical for which the two wrote music, ""70 Girls 70."" For every ""Chicago"" and Cabaret"" — both works with the Kander and Ebb team behind them — there are another handful of musicals that didn't make it, with some of the team's great music on the shelf with them.

""And the World Goes 'Round,"" the musical revue of their works, dusts them off and splices in some of their outside works for an engaging music marathon.

And there's always room for a tap dance, featuring Kayley Stevens and Charles Logan romping nimbly around stage. (Learn to tap dance, guys; that clicky cavort-athon changes the outcome of Logan's plaintive ""Marry Me"" proposal to Stevens.)

Each of the five in this production was chosen for a special skill; one may sing better, but precision timing and comic touch may be the forte for another. While Broadway veteran Patrick Sullivan may deliver a suitably menacing ""Kiss of the Spider Woman,"" he's fracturing as the toned, tanned, Ray-banned boy toy of ""Arthur in the Afternoon.""

All of them can sell the song, but they have to work to match Carolann Sanitas' vamp of ""How Lucky Can You Get,"" a tune from the long-gone ""Funny Lady"" sequel to ""Funny Girl."" (For the record, the hit ""Funny Girl"" was a Jule Styne-Bob Merrill collaboration, so you won't hear ""People"" here.)

Sanitas and Laura Hodos also ham up ""Class,"" from ""Chicago,"" playing a pair of low-lifes sniffing at others' manners. They reprise as a pair for ""What's So Wonderful,"" a movie star and a housewife wryly comparing lives.

Only Logan can match them in the silly, slightly suggestive cabaret paeon to ""Sara Lee,"" effusing over every product in the freezer:

And it thrills me right to my soul

When I'm chewin' your finger roll

And I'm cryin' ""For goodness sake

There never been a better banana cake""

And he lusts to taste her cherry Danish, too, so we're pretty sure this one didn't show up in TV commercials.

Logan does another comic turn with a ""Chicago"" tune as the sad sack ""Mr. Cellophane,"" a dweeb who can't even get the spotlight to stay on him as he moves.

The evening has its share of poignant moments, such as Sullivan's wistful ""I Don't Remember You"" from a musical titled ""The Happy Time."" He does its title tune as well; Hodos offers a hopeful ""Maybe This Time"" from ""Cabaret"" and Stevens meditates on love as ""A Quiet Thing"" (from ""Flora, the Red Menace"").

Karen Molnar's choreography takes advantage of the G&L Theatre's small stage with circular routines and visuals, such as a black light segment in ""New York, New York""; the troupe dons white top hats, gloves and spats for a visual treat on the darkened stage. She even puts the troupe on roller skates for breathtaking zips around ""The Rink,"" title tune to that musical.

This show employs lighting cleverly, embedding lights in the singers' hats to give their faces a glow for the dark tune ""Money, Money"" (from the movie version of ""Cabaret"").

And the troupe outdoes itself in a jazzed, Manhattan Transfer harmony take on the title tune from ""Cabaret,"" backed by Charles Fornara and a top-flight band whose arrangements — save for a strangely waltzy ""My Coloring Book"" — seal the evening.

It's a happy way for TheatreZone, and audiences, to close the 2018-19 season.

560,Trailer of supplies stolen from nonprofit that helps kids with cancer,"- After years of helping kids with cancer, a local nonprofit now needs help of its own after thieves stole the trailer that houses their organization.

The group, Hannah's Art From the Heart, was inspired by Hannah Douglas. The young girl bravely battled her cancer diagnosis for the majority of her young life. But just months before her eighth birthday, her family was forced to say goodbye.

""She just had a zest for life that was very inspiring and caught on to a lot of people. She affected anyone she met,"" said Michael Douglas, Hannah's father. ""She was a vibrant, vivacious young girl, the toughest girl I ever knew.""

But through that devastation came something beautiful as the Hannah's Art From the Heart organization was born.

""My friend, Stacy Griffin, she's a school teacher and her son, Trevor, and Hannah were about the same age,"" said Douglas. ""She came up with the idea of having kids make artwork, and then we would sell that artwork and donate all the proceeds to PCF.""

Continue reading below

The nonprofit started small but quickly grew. Hannah's Art From the Heart was able to raise over $17,000 for the Pediatric Cancer Foundation in Tampa.

""We have had thousands of pieces of art donated over the past 8 years and have raised over $17,000 for the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation. The children and art teachers of Citrus County have really rallied behind this cause,"" said Stacy Griffin, the third grade teacher at Rock Crusher Elementary who started the organization.

However, now their fund raising efforts are on hold. Griffin took to Facebook over the weekend pleading for the public's help after the trailer that houses the whole nonprofit organization was stolen from her backyard.

""It wasn't just the trailer,"" said Douglas. ""It was the artwork we were going to use for our next show. It's the tables, it's the banners, the tent, the walls. It's all of the stuff that we use.""

The trailer can be replaced, but the artwork that was donated by school kids all across Citrus County is priceless.

""This trailer had a lot of donated artwork, artwork the kids thought would go to help kids with cancer. It’s really invaluable because of all that it means to us,"" said Griffin.

Douglas is still hopeful the thieves might have a change of heart.

""Our hope is that someone looks inside, whoever took it, and is struck by some conscience to do the right thing,"" Douglas said.

The theft is a setback, yet Douglas and Griffin said it will take much more to keep them from using Hannah's story to make a difference.

""They may have taken the trailer,"" Douglas said. ""But they can't take her legacy.""

The theft has been reported to the Citrus County Sheriff's Office, and they confirmed to FOX 13 that they are investigating.

The trailer is white with a Florida tag of 9504UP.

BATON ROUGE — LSU's Devin White became the first linebacker picked in the top five of the first round in the NFL Draft since 2015 on Thursday night when he was selected at No. 5 by Tampa Bay.

The previous top five linebacker selected was Dante Fowler of Florida by Jacksonville at No. 3 in the first round in 2015.

White (6-foot-0, 237 pounds) won the Butkus Award that goes to the nation's top linebacker for the 2018 season as he made 123 total tackles to lead the Southeastern Conference and had 12 stops for loss, including three sacks, while forcing three fumbles and recovering two fumbles.

After running the 40-yard dash faster than any other linebacker at the NFL Combine in February at 4.42, White predicted great things, including in third person like NBA icon LeBron James.

""I'm trying to create a lane for myself,"" he said. ""I want to go in the top five. Devin isn't going to be on the board long, and we're not going to find another Devin 10 years from now. He's rare. Draft me, because when I hit free agency in five years, the price will go up. I'll be looking for $100 million then. ""

A native of Cotton Valley in north Louisiana, White played at nearby North Webster High in nearby Springhill, which is 47 miles northeast of Shreveport.

His fabulous LSU career followed two misdemeanor arrests while he was a senior at North Webster High. His arrest in Springhill on a charge of misdemeanor carnal knowledge of a 14-year-old girl on Nov. 20, 2015, and a later arrest on charges of careless operation of a vehicle and flight from an officer got him dismissed from the high school Under Armour All-Star game.

LSU signed him the following February as the No. 1 fullback in the nation. He soon moved to linebacker, where he was named to the All-SEC freshmen team after making 30 tackles in 12 games as a backup with a sack, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery.

White became a starter as a sophomore and led the SEC in tackles with 133 and made the All-SEC first team. He left LSU after his junior season and following no arrests or disciplinary issues in college.

""He matured and became a leader,"" NFL Draft expert Mike Detillier of WWL Radio in New Orleans said.

A versatile player with size and speed, White can play inside and outside linebacker.

""Athletically, Devin is off the charts with his combination of speed, quickness and power,"" Detillier said. ""He has first-rate football instincts. White can flow effortlessly from sideline to sideline. His roam ability is something special.""",http://rssfeeds.pnj.com/~/601198834/0/pensacola/home~NFL-Draft-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-select-Devin-White-with-the-th-pick-of-the-first-round/,2019-04-25T21:05:17Z,Pensacola News Journal,Couple,"101 E Romana St, Pensacola, FL 32502, USA",FL,32502

A cold front moving across the Gulf Coast could bring severe storms to the Tallahassee area tonight.

The biggest threats are damaging wind gusts up to 60 mph and isolated tornadoes, said Eric Bunker, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.

""We're expecting the main threat to kind of hug along the shore, but that doesn't mean inland areas won't see any impacts from these isolated storms,"" he said.

The storms are expected to arrive in the Tallahassee area between 11 p.m. tonight and 1 a.m. Friday, Bunker said. They are moving quickly and not expected to cause widespread flooding.

The storms are expected to arrive nearly a week after a powerful system spun off tornadoes and damaging winds in the area. An 8-year-old Woodville girl, Mariah Juliette Weinman, was killed in the April 19 storm when a tree branch crashed into her house.

A serious crash with injuries shut down a portion of Hancock Bridge Parkway on Wednesday.

Neighbors who heard the crash said four people were involved. The crash ended with a black SUV against a tree and a silver passenger car atop the SUV. Both vehicles had partially toppled several trees in the median.

Hannah Britt, 17, who lives across from the crash scene, said a man involved in the crash was ""lying on the grass and screaming. He had blood all over him.""

Britt said there were two females in one vehicle and a male and female had been in the other.

""I heard the squeal and then a loud crash,"" Britt said. ""I ran out and said 'Oh, my gosh'. Immediately I ran inside and called 911.""

Britt said traffic is normally heavy on that part of Hancock.

""I couldn't believe it,"" Britt said. ""When I first heard the tires squeal I thought someone swerved in front of somebody. But when I heard the crash I knew something was wrong.""

Sarah Nicol, 18, who lives down the block from the crash, was just coming home from school when she saw the mass of metal stuck in trees in the median.

""One girl had blood all over her face, she was freaking out,"" Nicol said. ""My dad was trying to calm her down.""

The crash closed down Hancock Bridge Parkway from Cultural Park Boulevard to Southeast 5th Avenue. Cape Coal police said the crash would likely keep Hancock closed for several hours.

Drivers were asked to avoid the area and seek and alternate route until 3:45 p.m.

Further information on the crash from Cape Coral police was not available.

566,"Boy, 4, dies after being burned while under care of mother's boyfriend, police say","Khalil Jabali, of Miami Gardens, is facing charges of aggravated child abuse and molestation of a child in connection with two separate incidents.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - A 4-year-old boy died Wednesday, days after he was burned while under the care of his mother's boyfriend, Miami Gardens police said.

According to a police report, Khalil Jabali, 23, was watching his girlfriend's three children Sunday while she was at work when the woman's son was burned by hot water that had been boiled in the microwave.

Police said Jabali called his girlfriend to tell her that the boy had wet his bed and was burned by hot water he had left in the bathroom when her younger child started crying.

Explaining that he had boiled water in the microwave so he could wash the boy's wet clothes, Jabali told police he left a bowl of hot water on the bathroom sink while he was in another room checking on the other child. When he returned to the bathroom, Jabali said he found the boy on the floor moaning and his skin peeling off.

The boy's mother left work and, along with Jabali, took her son to Jackson North Medical Center. He was then transferred to the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.

Police said the boy had burns to 15 percent of his body.

The boy also had other injuries, including bleeding around the brain and the chest cavity and broken ribs, authorities said.

The boy's body was taken to the Miami-Dade County medical examiner’s office, where an official cause of death will be determined.

Jabali was initially arrested on an aggravated child abuse charge. It's unclear whether that charge will be upgraded.

Jabali also faces a molestation charge involving a 6-year-old girl.

He remains in custody at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center without bond.

568,Key West woman accused of leading police on chase while 3 kids were in SUV,"Shauna Coulson, 45, of Key West, is accused of leading authorities on a chase on U.S. 1 while she had three children inside her SUV.

MARATHON, Fla. - A Key West woman was arrested Tuesday afternoon after she fled from Monroe County Sheriff's Office deputies and other law enforcement officers as they tried to pull over her SUV, authorities said.

According to Sheriff's Office spokesman Adam Linhardt, Shauna Coleen Coulson, 45, was driving the SUV recklessly while she had her three daughters inside.

According to authorities, multiple drivers called 911 beginning at 12:15 p.m. to report a silver Kia SUV being driven recklessly while heading north on U.S. 1 in Marathon.

Deputies said the SUV was driving into oncoming traffic and had its flashing yellow lights on.

According to Linhardt, drivers reported that a bag was also thrown from the SUV.

Linhardt said Key Colony Beach Officer Jefferson Rodriguez tried to pull over the vehicle at mile marker 54, but Coulson refused to pull over.

Authorities said she continued driving into oncoming traffic while reaching speeds of 75 mph, and more items were thrown from the SUV.

Deputies and officers from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission continued following the SUV until it was forced to stop after its tires were spiked on U.S. 1 at mile marker 62.5.

Linhardt said Coulson was arrested on charges of fleeing and eluding authorities and three counts of child abuse.

The three children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- were not injured and were turned over to the care of the Florida Department of Children and Families, Linhardt said.

According to an arrest report, Coulson had thick, white saliva at the edges of her mouth. Deputies said the eldest child told authorities that her mother was foaming at the mouth because she has low blood sugar. Authorities said she also said her mother asked her and her sisters to hand her stuff to throw out the window of the SUV during the chase.

According to the report, the girl said she feared for her and her sisters' lives. She also said her mother had previously stopped for water at Mote Marine and began to yell at her and her sisters to not trust anyone.

According to Linhardt, a dog and cat were also inside the SUV and were handed over to the Florida Keys Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

The animals did not appear to be injured, authorities said.

569,Basecamp Ventures deal for Camp McConnell appears unlikely,"Jordan Richmond and his nonprofit were poised to run the camp prior to a Marion County school investigation resurfacing.

Alachua County leaders say they have lost confidence in having Basecamp Ventures run a 212-acre, year-round children's camp near Micanopy after previously stalling negotiations due to accusations that the nonprofit's president had an inappropriate relationship with a 16-year-old student.

Last week, The Sun reported that Jordan A. Richmond was investigated in 2016 by the Marion County School District for having an inappropriate relationship with an underage female high school student. Richmond has denied any wrongdoing and was never arrested or criminally charged, but lost his teaching job as West Port High School as a result of the investigation.

After the accusations resurfaced, the county canceled its negotiation meeting with Richmond days before it took place. Richmond was also fired last week by the Girl Scouts of Gateway Council as the organization’s chief girl experience and outdoor programming officer.

""While I was supportive of the plan for Camp McConnell, I'm no longer confident of Basecamp Venture's capacity to operate it in the full confidence of the community and this commissioner,"" Commissioner Robert Hutchinson said.

Hutchinson said his concerns are specifically how the board of directors at the nonprofit did not mention the accusations against Richmond.

At Tuesday's county meeting, commissioners largely agreed that it would be tough to move forward with Richmond's company to run Camp McConnell, where Richmond previously served as director of the camp when run by the YMCA.

In a phone interview, Commissioner Marihelen Wheeler said she’s disappointed by the ordeal. She said she feels sorry for the way plans for Camp McConnell turned out, adding that she no longer supports Richmond running the camp.

“I just don't think we can do it,” she said. “I don't think we can take the risk.”

Commissioner Ken Cornell said he, too, had concerns about proceeding with the Ocala-based nonprofit after reviewing information relating to Richmond's investigation.

""My initial review of this background information provided by staff raises real concerns for me about proceeding with Basecamp Ventures,"" he said.

Last week, Richmond emailed commissioners to again deny the accusations previously made against him.

“The allegations from 3 years ago were proved to be unfounded,” he wrote. “There was an extensive investigation done by both the school system and the state of Florida which led to no criminal charges or findings. Everything else that was said was hearsay and nothing more.”

Though Richmond wasn't arrested, the investigation didn’t exonerate Richmond as he has stated.

The Marion County schools investigation resulted in Richmond losing his teaching job and he was reprimanded for misconduct. Investigators found he used poor judgment, showed partiality toward the female student and that he lost the confidence of his students after teachers and students raised concerns about Richmond’s close relationship with a 16-year-old student.

During the investigation, and after being warned about the relationship, Richmond, who is now 40, was found by police on a Sunday evening in a vehicle with the girl behind an abandoned car dealership in Ocala. Richmond said he was being supportive to a student who was upset.

Richmond previously told The Sun that he was reprimanded for “writing too many hall passes,” though a copy of the reprimand letter shows he was reprimanded for misconduct as part of the district’s investigation. He was reprimanded again by the Florida Department of Education for lying on an application for a teaching job in Lake County.

""This is bad,"" said Commissioner Chuck Chestnut, who has wanted to sell the land from the beginning. ""For one, it dealt with children and the perception of this will hinder the success of Basecamp. That's the issue.""

Richmond’s proposal to the county included nearly two dozen letters from organizations vouching for Richmond and his company, all prior to the accusations surfacing.

One of those organizations was the Girl Scouts of the Gateway Council, which fired Richmond two days after The Sun reported details of the 2016 investigation.

David Bowles, a senior director for recreation at the University of Florida, had written a letter commending Richmond and his plans for the camp, but said any conversation involving Richmond in the camp is now a dead issue.

“It’s over,” he said.

Despite concerns, some are still in Richmond’s corner, saying that the investigation never proved an inappropriate or physical relationship.

State Sen. Keith Perry, R-Gainesville, says he stands behind Richmond, despite the investigation. Perry had ties to Basecamp Ventures when Richmond first tried to land the Camp McConnell deal.

“I’m 100 percent supportive of Jordan,” Perry said. “I think he’s an incredible person.”

Perry, who helped Richmond develop his business plan, said people should take accusations seriously but that sometimes the perception of people working closely with kids can be seen negatively, especially for those who take up a father-figure role.

“It’s admirable for people to care and want to work with youth, but the problem is perception,” Perry said. “I think it’s good for everyone to be skeptical and concerned, but not cynical.”

Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce President Eric Godet urged commissioner to sell the property to Basecamp Ventures in his letter. Godet did not return calls throughout the day seeking comment. CHW Professional Consultants Vice President Gerry Dedenbach, who sits on the board of directors for Basecamp, also didn’t return calls.

Rae Waddell, director of the Florida Youth Conservation Centers Network for The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said she was unaware of the accusations against Richmond.

Though commissioners did not vote on the issue, Cornell said he anticipates a discussion about the allegations in the near future upon further review of Richmond's background.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190423/basecamp-ventures-deal-for-camp-mcconnell-appears-unlikely?rssfeed=true,2019-04-23T21:48:39Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
571,Deputies: 2-year-old drowns in Baker County retention pond,"MACCLENNY, Fla. - A 2-year-old boy pulled from a retention pond off West Minnesota Avenue in Macclenny drowned Tuesday morning, according to Baker County Sheriff Scotty Rhoden.

A post on the Baker County Sheriff's Office Facebook page said the boy, Franklin Parker, was being watched overnight by his 18-year-old older sister while the two were staying with friends. Their parents were at work, deputies said.

The girl told deputies she and Franklin slept together on a couch, but he woke up at 6:50 a.m. and she gave him a toy and a cellphone to play games on. She said the doors were all closed, but the front door was unlocked at the time.

Deputies said the sister was later awakened by neighbors knocking on the door, saying they'd seen Franklin running around outside between 9:40 and 10 a.m.

The girl and the two neighbors searched for the boy, and one of the neighbors found him in the nearby retention pond.

""When I came out to smoke a cigarette I seen the man jump in the water and then I seen him carry the baby out,"" neighbor Gordon Hall said. ""He said the baby was face down in the water.""

Another neighbor began CPR on Franklin until deputies arrived.

Franklin was taken to Ed Fraser Memorial Hospital in Macclenny, where he died.

Trisha Bennett, who lives across from the pond, has two small children and said she was heartbroken by what happened.

""I did not know a pond was over there,"" Bennett said. ""I see people all the time, riding four-wheelers all the time over there. I did not necessarily know there was a pond over there.""

News4Jax is working to learn more, including why the retention pond across from a small apartment complex is not fenced.

A check with the St. Johns Water Management District showed the pond, which is under construction as part of a storage unit lot, was permitted. The owner told News4Jax a fence is planned but hasn't been built yet.

The owner was devastated Tuesday but declined an interview.

The Department of Children and Families was notified and is investigating the boy's death.

""Sheriff Scotty Rhoden asks the community for continued prayers for the family and friends of the deceased, as well as the Law Enforcement Officers involved in the investigation,"" the Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook.

It was just another day for Warren Zink at the driving range on Williams Road in Estero. The instructor was walking down the line of golfers hitting balls when he came across a 5-year-old girl.

The girl's parents were watching her, and something struck Zink when he saw her swing.

""I kept watching her right leg,"" Zink said. ""Her right heel was just all the way through the ball. She had a perfect follow-through. I said to myself 'This girl is just a natural.'

""I'll never forget the first day.""

Talia Rodino is 15 now, and has provided Zink and others with quite a few memories. The newest will be Sunday, when Rodino plays in the Drive, Chip and Putt Finals at Augusta National Golf Club leading into Masters week. The Golf Channel telecast starts at 8 a.m.

""I'm looking forward to just being able to take in the whole experience of being on Augusta National, getting to hit shots there,"" said Rodino, who gets to go to Monday's practice round, among other treats. ""People wish that they could do what I'm doing, and it's crazy that I get to do it at such a young age.

""It would obviously be great to win, but I've already won just by being able to go there. I'm just going to take in the experience and have a fun time. I want to come out of it saying that was the best thing I've ever done, and just enjoy it.""

Rodino nearly didn't make it in what was her last shot at qualifying for the finals. In the regional at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach way back in September, the Bishop Verot High School freshman had finished her driving and chipping, and was down to three putts. And she didn't know it, but she was also down to her last chance.

Peter and Deanna, her father and mother, knew that Rodino needed to make at least one of the putts to win the 14-15 division's only qualifying spot for Augusta. She missed her 6-footer. Her 15-footer was close.

That left 30 feet between Rodino and her last chance at Augusta; she'll be too old next year. It turned out Rodino could have tied if her ball stopped no more than a foot away. But her ball went all 30 feet.

Her parents screamed loudly as the ball went into the cup. Rodino was happy it went in, but was puzzled at first by the degree of their cheers.

""I walked off the green and it was like I just made it,"" she said, referring to the putt. ""My mom's like 'You won.' ... It felt great.""

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

Rodino worked to prepare with coaches Andy Scott and Tom Speicher, and was trying to find the fastest greens possible to simulate Augusta National's lightning-quick ones. It all comes down to just two drives, two chips and two putts Sunday.

""There's only six shots — only six shots,"" said Rodino, who has her parents, Verot golf coach and Stoneybrook pro Jeff Nixon, Stoneybrook director of programs Bobby Conway, Scott and Speicher up there to cheer her on. ""It's a little different than just playing a round of golf. You have to improve on each shot. Your drives, they only count one of the two. You just have to make sure that you get both of them in the grid and it's by distance. Chipping is just getting it close, and putting is getting it close and trying to make it as much as possible.""

The road for Rodino started well before even Zink saw her that day when she was 5. Peter said she always had good hand-eye coordination. She was hitting golf balls as soon as she could walk.

But everything started to take off when Zink and fellow pro Josh Musselman took her under their wings. Zink and Musselman made her first two sets of clubs. After that first day, Zink told Peter and Deanna to bring Talia every Saturday for a lesson. No charge.

""Never charged them a dime,"" Zink said. ""It was a pleasure. It was an honor on my part.""

Zink remembered before their first lesson, Peter had a little talk with Talia, telling her to make sure she respected Zink and listen to him because he was giving up his time, which was something valuable. Zink said he appreciated Peter saying that, but then looked at Talia after they were alone and said ""Let's have some fun.""

Nancy Sutton started out as doing video and photos for some of Zink's lessons, but she started taking lessons herself, and then her connection with Rodino and her parents grew as well.

""We were like our own little family,"" Sutton said.

Zink also set up team scrambles with himself and ""Little T"" as he called Rodino, Sutton and another pro, Joe Diego, once or twice a week at Eagle Ridge Golf Club in Fort Myers.

Zink, who is 65 and lives in Naples, hasn't done golf instruction in years, but he still has those he's helped, and Rodino tops the list.

""That little girl was just the joy of my life,"" said Zink, who still has a picture of 5-year-old Talia on his desk and her first putter, one with a pink grip. ""Students come and go, but this is the one out of the million.This is the one that says, that's why I did it.

""I tell everybody how proud I am of her.""

After waiting for five months, Rodino is ready for Sunday.

Claire spent her childhood frolicking with her aunt in the seaside sand at Blankenberge on Belgium’s northern coast, playing in the wooded Bois de la Cambre park on the outskirts of Brussels, rambling with cousins around a goldfish-filled lake at the lush Jardin Botanique near the Royal Palace and toying with buttons on her father’s tailor shop floor.

Less than a year after Nazis invaded in 1940, that came to an end.

Claire was sent to live with an elderly Catholic couple who could pass her off as their granddaughter, and her close-knit relatives split up among several non-Jewish households.

“By dividing themselves, they felt they gave the children a better chance to survive,” said Claire, 83, of Palm Coast, whose surname is now Soria.

They visited her in secret at first. But one by one, the loved ones in her photos disappeared, snatched up by the Gestapo and shipped to Auschwitz. All she had left was her sewing basket.

‘I could not stop crying’

Claire watched the Nazi troops and tanks parading through the streets of Brussels a few days after her fifth birthday.

Soldiers removed Belgian flags and hoisted the red, white and black Nazi banner in their place. Signs decrying Jews appeared soon after.

“We could never imagine (back) then what was on the horizon,” said Claire. “From one day to the next, everything changed.”

Her parents had to stop going to work, were forbidden from some public places and could only shop during certain hours. Though her youth shielded her from much of the discrimination adults experienced, she sensed a shift.

Her kindergarten friends were afraid to be seen playing with a girl wearing a yellow star, but Claire didn’t understand the correlation.

“I even sewed one on my clothing and didn’t see anything wrong with that,” she said — until her parents realized the stars made it easier for people to report any Jews they knew to the authorities.

“I don’t think in the beginning people had any idea of what was going on,” Claire said. But her parents, fearing arrest, asked their Catholic neighbors to shelter her.

Lambert and Lea Sabaux (pronounced Sa-bow) agreed to take her in and acted as if she were a visiting granddaughter. They loved her like one, too.

Claire’s parents, aunt and cousin Nina visited when they could. They sent her letters and postcards. She stowed them all in her sewing basket.

“That basket has always been paramount to my story,” Claire said. “It’s the one thing I’ve saved my whole life.”

When school was back in session in fall 1941, Jewish children were forbidden to attend.

Grandma and Grandpa, as Claire called her caretakers, thought she’d be safer with a French name. She chose Yvette in honor of one of her lost friends.

The Sabauxes took “Yvette” to a different school to enroll in first grade.

“If this child happens to be Jewish, the Gestapo will come and pick her up,” Claire recalled the principal’s warning. “So we left, and by noon (the Sabauxes) called the school and gave a phony excuse (for me dropping out).”

They found a tutor who would come to their home, but that, too, soon fell through. A teacher visiting each day could attract unwanted Gestapo attention.

A music education was the only option. Lea Sabaux, a former concert pianist, trained Claire to play, and Lambert Sabaux took her along when he played drums at a corner cafe on their street.

Claire was a homebody by nature, so she didn’t mind staying inside. She learned solitaire and spent hours playing card games to pass the time.

Her family’s visits became fewer and eventually stopped all together.

In March 1943, the Gestapo barged into the home where her mother, aunt and uncle were hiding. The three of them were among 1,638 Jews deported on the 20th transport train from Malines, Belgium, to Auschwitz.

Her father was arrested on a streetcar, and shipped out on the 21st train from Malines. Her beloved cousin Nina, then 17, was turned in by a neighbor. She, too, was sent to Auschwitz.

“I could not stop crying,” Claire said. “(I wondered), ‘Who’s next? How much more can I take?’”

Gestapo at the door

Word of an imminent Gestapo raid typically traveled through the Belgian underground resistance network in time for the Sabauxes to whisk Claire to safety in the countryside.

One time the Nazis caught them by surprise.

Claire was asleep upstairs, and her cousins, two sisters ages 7 and 9, had just turned up on the Sabauxes' doorstep seeking shelter.

Knowing they couldn’t care for three children, the Sabauxes took them in anyway. That’s when the Gestapo came knocking.

Lea Sabaux made a show of fumbling with her keys. She knew the cost of collaborating with Jews — they risked being shot or shipped to Auschwitz to join the rest of Claire’s family.

“I can’t open the door,” she called.

The officers moved on to the next house with a warning: “We’ll be back.”

They never returned, and the Sabauxes found Claire’s cousins a new safe house. Both girls survived the war.

Some of the Sabauxes’ neighbors were not so lucky.

“There were times I actually did see the Gestapo going from house to house and pulling people out of their homes and forcing them into trucks,” Claire said. “And if they did not do as they were told, they were shot. I remember that vividly.”

‘They risked their lives’

Claire’s story shares notable similarities with that of Anne Frank, with one distinct difference — Claire survived. But as the war went on, the odds of doing so seemed to diminish.

The Sabauxes lived near a railroad bridge frequently targeted in German airstrikes early in the war and by the Allies near the end of it.

And then there were the “Vengeance” missiles — the low-flying V-1 and the longer-range, deadlier V-2 — that Germany launched toward sites in England and Belgium.

Neither weapon was very accurate, and air raid sirens alerted civilians of incoming missiles that fell short of their targets. Claire learned to distinguish the difference by their sounds.

“Are they going to hit our area or not? You never knew for sure,” Claire said. They huddled in the basement until a second siren signaled it was safe.

“We would come back up and that’s when we could see down the street, up the street, homes demolished,” she said.

Food was rationed, and there wasn’t much.

One night at dinner, Claire’s place at the table was the only one set with food. She realized her caretakers had given her the last of their store and refused to eat alone.

“They said, ‘OK, go to bed, you’ll have it in the morning.’ And I did,” she said. “They were so caring. They just wanted what was best for me.”

The Allies eradicated Nazi forces from Belgium in early 1945, but Belgian towns continued to be a target for Vengeance missiles.

Claire doesn’t have a specific memory associated with the war’s end, but she recalled the trickle of Jews returning to town. “It always gave me hope that next would be my mom and dad,” she said.

But when her cousin Nina was released from Auschwitz, she brought bad news. Claire’s father had been tortured to death and her mother, aunt and uncle all were killed in the camp.

“I remember the day that Nina sat down with me and not only told me that my mom and dad were not coming back, but explained to me the fact that I am Jewish,” Claire said. “That was the beginning of the change in my life.”

Claire spent more than four years with the Sabauxes — and by then was much closer to them than to her surviving family — but the law gave custody of war orphans to adult relatives. Claire had to move in with an aunt.

“I was so upset,” she said. “(Grandma and Grandpa) were so nice to me. They risked their lives to save mine.”

She was permitted to visit them at first, but she would always come home crying. Her aunt stopped letting her see them.

“She did not realize that (my tears were) love,” Claire said.

Her aunt sent her away to summer camp to spend time with children her age, and then, at age 13, to the U.S. She didn’t speak English and was several years behind in school. Those were some of her darkest days, she said.

Claire eventually married and had three children. She has six grandkids and two great-grandchildren.

Grandma’s piano lessons paid off. Claire followed in her footsteps and became a piano teacher. She still has 14 students.

A year after Claire arrived in the U.S., she received correspondence from Lambert Sabaux.

“My dearest Yvette, these few lines are to let you know that it’s been terrible for us since you left. It’s sad to say but Grandma has suddenly gotten very ill,” the letter begins.

Lea Sabaux, hospitalized a few months after Claire’s departure, did not live much longer. Lambert Sabaux passed away soon after that.

“I could almost swear that it’s from a broken heart,” Claire said. She still cries every time she reads the letter.

It continues: “You wrote in your letter that you missed us very much. I know it. But that's life. The only thing I wish for you now is for you to be happy,” Lambert Sabaux wrote. “I must end my letter because I can't stop crying.”

Claire saved the letter in her sewing basket.

'Never forget'

The Holocaust survivors’ rallying cry has long been “never forget.”

As the youngest survivors age into their 70s, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., makes a special effort to preserve firsthand accounts in order to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike.

To honor this week's Days of Remembrance, established by Congress as the nation’s annual Holocaust commemoration, The News-Journal is sharing the individual accounts of four local Holocaust survivors.

Aimee Rubensteen, the museum's acquisitions coordinator, travels South Florida “rescuing the evidence of the Holocaust by speaking to firsthand witnesses,” she said, and collecting their World War II-era photos, letters, newspaper clippings, clothing and other artifacts of historical value.

“These original artifacts will be the things that teach the Holocaust to future generations,” Rubensteen said.

The museum’s mission is to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike and to encourage critical thinking about how and why those atrocities occurred.

Firsthand stories make those larger themes more personal.

“A lot of people don’t know about these specific, individual stories. The more we spread the word and expand the conversation, the better it is for everyone,” Rubensteen said.

Individuals or families who are interested in sharing their Holocaust artifacts or family keepsakes with the museum may contact Rubensteen at 786-496-2788 or arubensteen@ushmm.org to schedule an appointment.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190430/palm-coast-woman-tells-how-neighbors-helped-her-outlast-holocaust?rssfeed=true,2019-04-30T04:24:01Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
580,Celebs who've opened up about their fertility struggles,"Following Jenna Bush Hagar’s announcement on “TODAY” earlier this week, as she told fans that she and her husband are expecting their third child, meteorologist Dylan Dreyer later in the show bravely revealed her own personal news: an emotional battle with infertility.

In honor of National Infertility Awareness Week, Dreyer spoke about a recent miscarriage and her infertility struggle, and said she hopes to “shed the stigma” by sharing her truth.

Due to her emergency C-section with her first-born, Dreyer is unable to conceive, and is now exploring alternative methods. In fact, about 10 percent of women experience difficulty getting or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

We thought we'd shine a light on all the celebrities who've spoken about their own struggles or unique situations.

1.) Elizabeth Banks

Getty Images

Kicking off our list is Banks, who referenced her ""broken belly"" in a blog entry back in 2011. The post, in which Banks introduces her newborn son, Felix, reads, in part: ""After years of trying to get pregnant, exploring the range of fertility treatments, all unsuccessful, our journey led us to gestational surrogacy: we make a 'baby cake' and bake it in another woman's 'oven.'""

Really, it only feels appropriate that Banks used some humor in her analogy. Banks and her husband went on to have a second son, also through surrogacy, about a year after Felix's arrival.

2.) Tyra Banks

Getty Images

The “America’s Next Top Model” host welcomed a son in January 2016 who was born through gestational surrogacy. But Banks did a lot of in vitro fertilization leading up to that. She said once in an interview, “On Cycle 22's final runway, at the [Walt] Disney Concert Hall, I had to go into a back closet and give myself my final shot, and that was the seventh round of IVF.”

3.) Angela Bassett

Getty Images

Bassett, of “American Horror Story” fame, alongside her husband, Courtney B. Vance, has spoken publicly several times about how long it took to conceive the couple’s twins. Bassett told Oprah the pair eventually opted to use a surrogate, after enduring seven years of failed fertility treatments. Bassett has also spoken to Jet magazine about the couple's struggles.

4.) Beyonce

Getty Images

Beyonce proved she was one of us after all, when she shared in her 2013 HBO documentary, “Beyoncé: Life Is but a Dream,” that she suffered a miscarriage before Blue Ivy was born, and then reportedly got ""frustrated"" after unsuccessful IVF treatments. Queen Bey and husband Jay-Z were even looking into surrogates and adoption, according to published reports, before the couple went on to have two healthy twins, Rumi and Sir, carried by Beyonce herself.

5.) Jordana Brewster

Getty Images

The “Fast and the Furious” actress spoke to Cosmopolitan magazine in October 2014 about motherhood and the experience of using a surrogate. She said, in part, ""I couldn't carry a baby. At first, I was scared. I had no idea what [surrogacy] entailed. Then I started researching agencies. ... [Surrogacy] taught me a lot to have to rely on someone else to carry my baby for me, because I'm such a private and self-sufficient person. It's the most intimate leap of faith and trust you can take.""

6.) Mariah Carey

When Carey got together with her (now-ex) husband Nick Cannon, Carey was nearly 40. But the two wanted to have a baby together, so they tried naturally at first -- and suffered a miscarriage in 2008. After some continued struggles, the pair decided to go through IVF. They successfully went on to have a set of healthy twins, perhaps thanks to the advice from Carey’s friend, Celine Dion, who recommended acupuncture to reduce Carey's stress levels. It’s been said that acupuncture might improve your chances of pregnancy, in some cases. Carey talked about the practice to Access Hollywood in 2010.

7.) Courteney Cox

“I had a bunch of miscarriages,” the “Friends” star reportedly said in her Facebook Watch web series, “9 Months with Courteney Cox,” which follows 10 couples with different pregnancy experiences. “But I was lucky enough to have my little girl, Coco, who I had through IVF.”

“If I can share any light or give wisdom to somebody, or hope, of course, I would share anything I can,” Cox told Entertainment Tonight. “I think that’s important.”

8.) Celine Dion

Getty Images

As mentioned above, it was Dion who recommended acupuncture to Carey for help getting and staying pregnant. Dion and her (now late) husband René Angélil started trying for kids when Dion was in her 30s, but they didn't have any luck. Years later and after seven IVF cycles, the couple finally had their sons, first, René-Charles, and then twins Nelson and Eddy.

Regarding those seven IVF cycles, Dion once said in an interview, ""I thought as long as my health permitted me and unless my doctor thought physically I couldn’t do it, then I would go on with the IVF until someone told me to stop.”

9.) Lena Dunham

Getty Images

Dunham has been very open about her decade-long struggle with endometriosis pain -- and she’s even posted about her decision to undergo a hysterectomy at the age of 31. There’s still a chance Dunham could be a mother someday, considering the available options like egg freezing and surrogacy, and she told Vogue that those possibilities, coupled with the idea of adoption, (are) a “thrilling truth I’ll pursue with all my might.”

10.) Jimmy Fallon

Getty Images

Fallon, host of “The Tonight Show” said on “TODAY” that he and his wife, Nancy Juvonen, endured a five-year infertility struggle before having their daughter, Winnie, via a surrogate. ""We've tried a bunch of things,"" he told host Savannah Guthrie. ""Anyone who's tried will know -- it's just awful.""

11.) Camille Grammer

Getty Images

“Speaking of childbirth, I had my children through surrogacy,"" the former star of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills has said, according to a blog. ""If you can’t get pregnant for whatever reason, it’s great to know that there are options available for people that want to have a family. I wish I could have had that experience. I’m just so grateful I had a wonderful surrogate who carried our two children. I have two amazing angels in my life that I love so much. They are such a gift and a blessing from God.”

Grammer was married to Kelsey Grammer from 1997 to 2011. Their kids, Mason and Jude, are now teenagers.

12.) Shawn Johnson

Getty Images

The gold medal-winning former gymnast shared that she felt guilty after miscarrying her first baby.

""I felt sad,"" Johnson said. ""And I remember telling Andrew (East), 'I'm sorry I lost your baby.' I felt like it was something that I did. I didn't take care of the baby well enough. I was stressed out too much. Or I didn't take the right prenatal vitamins. There are all these different guilts and thoughts and negative feelings … like, I failed my baby. … I felt like I was (uninhabitable). Like, no baby's going to live inside this belly.""

The good news is, just more than a year later, the two are expecting!

13.) Khloe Kardashian

Getty Images

After years of wanting a baby -- which was pretty well-documented on reality TV during Kardashian’s marriage to then-NBA star Lamar Odom -- she finally got one: her daughter, True, was born in April 2018. Odom was out of the picture by then, and Cleveland Cavaliers forward Tristan Thompson is True’s father, but that’s neither here nor there.

Kardashian had explored the possibilities of parenthood with Odom, and at the time, the situation on TV seemed to be chalked up to unexplained infertility. When Kardashian was questioned about this years later, she clarified: “I did all my treatments, but then when we did further testing, we realized I was NOT the one with the issue. ... It takes two to have a baby.”

14.) Nicole Kidman

Getty Images

Kidman and husband Keith Urban surprised fans in 2010 when they announced the birth of their daughter, Faith, born through a gestational carrier. Kidman has since spoken openly about her ups and downs with fertility, according to ABC News.

15.) Hoda Kotb

Getty Images

The “TODAY” host had always wanted to be a mom, but a battle with breast cancer a decade ago left her unable to conceive, according to Southern Living. ""Sometimes in your life, things just don't work out for whatever reason, so you say, 'Well, I wasn't meant to have that.' But it was really hard to come to terms with it."" Fast-forward to today, Kotb has two adopted daughters: Hope Catherine and Haley Joy.

(For what it’s worth, perhaps this is proof that it’s never too late! Kotb became a new mother at the age of 52!)

16.) Jana Kramer

Getty Images

The country music star spoke to People magazine about getting pregnant naturally with both of her children, after two failed IVF cycles. What are the odds?

17.) Joan Lunden

Getty Images

The former “Good Morning America” host has joked that she’s the “poster child” for infertility. Having children through a surrogate was still a bit of a novelty when Lunden did it in 2003 and again in 2005.

“Families these days are made in many different ways,” she once said to Newsmax Health. “It’s really a wonderful amazing thing that there are women in this world who are so selfless that they will carry a child for another couple, that will help them make a family.”

Lunden even did a big spread with People magazine back in 2003, detailing her circumstances.

18.) Maria Menounos

Getty Images

Menounos has been very public about her journey, chatting about it on her satellite radio show, posting about it on social media -- heck, she’s even Snapchatted her egg-retrieval process.

Read the interview she did with Health magazine in June 2016. At last check, she and her husband, longtime love Keven Undergaro, were considering using a surrogate.

19.) Michelle Obama

Getty Images

The former first lady shared in her memoir that she and her husband, former President Barack Obama, conceived their daughters, Sasha and Malia, via IVF. Michelle also said in the book that she felt very alone after suffering a miscarriage, about 20 years ago.

20.) Sarah Jessica Parker

Getty Images

Parker suffered from secondary infertility, which is when you struggle to conceive after already giving birth to a child. When she was filming the movie “Did You Hear About the Morgans?”, which came out in 2009, she and her husband, Matthew Broderick, shared with the world that they were expecting twins through surrogacy. Elle magazine credits the announcement with sparking a national conversation about surrogacy: the economics and the reasoning behind it.

""I knew there would be lots of opinions about, ‘Well, why didn't you adopt? Why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that?’ and the truth of the matter is, it wasn't one or the other for us,” Parker said.

She went on to tell the magazine that she and Broderick had explored all their options. This just so happened to come first.

21.) Giuliana Rancic

Getty Images

Rancic’s story could fill a book -- but we’ll let the “E!” host do the talking: She penned a really poignant piece called “#LetsTalkFertility” in April 2018, in which she discusses “hundreds of shots, multiple rounds of IVF, miscarriage and heartbreak.”

She writes, “No one ever told me, ‘Oh, by the way, your eggs change when you reach a certain age.’ I definitely had misconceptions about my fertility. … Unfortunately, fertility is a topic that people don’t talk about – it makes them uncomfortable. There is still stigma and silence that is attached to fertility issues that is painful to the core. But the truth is, 1 in 8 couples in the U.S. are impacted by infertility, so it’s time we shift the cultural narrative by talking about it. Now more than ever, this feels like the right time to normalize the conversation around fertility.”

22.) Elisabeth Rohm

Getty Images

Rohm, perhaps best known for her role as Serena Southerlyn on “Law & Order,” wanted to be the one who told her story, as well. So she wrote a book called, “Baby Steps: Having the Child I Always Wanted (Just Not As I Expected).”

Here’s what she said on the topic of infertility to New York Metro Parents: “I discovered at 34 that I had fertility issues and that if I wanted to have a child I needed to do IVF pretty aggressively, which came as a shock to me. We kept it to ourselves. We only shared it with our very closest family members. But after talking to a girlfriend who was on her third miscarriage and who felt like she needed to get some help, I decided to tell her I had done IVF. There was this instant feeling of connection in telling the truth about it and this relief in being able to help her find the right doctor. We need to move the ball down the field of talking about infertility openly and not being ashamed of it, if we’re experiencing it.” Hats off, Elisabeth!

23.) Brooke Shields

Getty Images

After a miscarriage and undergoing several rounds of IVF to no avail, Shields tried one final round of IVF at the age of 36, according to Fertility Today. And it worked -- Shields got pregnant in 2002 and gave birth to her daughter, Rowan, in 2003. She wrote about the experience in her memoir, according to reports.

24.) Amy Smart

Getty Images

Last year, Smart took to her Instagram page to share a sweet photo of her and her daughter -- and mentioned using a surrogate to carry the baby after years of her own infertility struggles. The post is flooded with comments from well-wishers, including users saying things like, “Thank you for being open about your fertility struggles, @smarthouse26. Your honesty helps destigmatize it and helps anyone going through it feel more normal and OK. Bless you and your perfect daughter.”

25.) Trista Sutter

Getty Images

The “Bachelorette” alum called her two-year infertility struggle “definitely a dark time in my life,” in an article in US Weekly. She and her husband, Ryan Sutter, went on to have two children, but she detailed her struggles and the insecurities she felt while promoting her book in 2015.

26.) Chrissy Teigen

Getty Images

These days, Teigen and husband John Legend have their hands full, chasing after two kids. But it wasn't always like this.

""I will say, honestly, John and I are having trouble,"" Teigen confessed in 2015, adding that they'd seen fertility doctors. ""We would have kids five, six years ago if it'd happened. But my gosh, it's been a process! ... So, any time somebody asks me if I'm going to have kids, I'm like, 'One day, you're going to ask that to the wrong girl who's really struggling, and it's going to be really hurtful to them. And I hate that. So, I hate it. Stop asking me!'"" Tyra Banks, mentioned up top, got emotional about her own journey during the ""FABLife"" discussion, as well.

27.) Gabrielle Union

""If you happen to have issues with fertility as you've gotten older and you happen to have a career, all is not lost,"" said Union, the wife of Dwayne Wade, during a visit to ""TODAY.""

""There is so much hope, there are so many options.""

In an interview with Redbook, she said, ""So far, it has not happened for us. A lot of my friends deal with [struggles to have a baby]. There's a certain amount of shame that is placed on women who have perhaps chosen a career over starting a family younger."" She went on to say that it's important not to feel that shame.

28.) Kate Walsh

""I don’t have children. I’m not going to have kids,"" the actress told Maria Menounos on her SiriusXM radio show. ""I went through early menopause.""

29.) Kim Kardashian West

Getty Images

When you’re Kardashian West, not a lot in your life is able to slide under the radar. She’s made headlines many times in recent years for her fertility. Kardashian West carried her first two children, then used a surrogate for her third baby, Chicago, and the one she and husband Kanye West are currently expecting.

Kardashian West developed placenta accreta, a condition in which the placenta doesn't detach from the wall of the womb properly, which is why she says she’s now using a carrier.

She revealed in “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” that the damage left her with a hole in her uterus that required surgery if she was to conceive again. Kardashian West underwent the surgery, but it was unsuccessful. Marie Claire reports that she said, “I can’t carry any more kids. It’s the worst. It’s not going to be happy for me. I had a full break down. I give up.”

The bubbly “Hairspray” star beat cervical cancer at the age of 27, but lost her cervix and uterus. With that, she lost the possibility of getting pregnant herself, but fortunately enough, found a surrogate she bonded with and trusted.

""The second I met her, I knew, ‘This was it. This was the woman.' Exactly six months later, we were pregnant."" Watch Winokur as she tells her story in this YouTube video from Redbook magazine.

31.) Mark Zuckerberg

The Facebook founder and his wife, Priscilla Chan, cut right to the chase when announcing their pregnancy on -- well, what other platform would you expect? -- Facebook (of course!)

""Priscilla and I have some exciting news: we're expecting a baby girl! ... We want to share one experience to start. We've been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way.

""You feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a child. You start imagining who they'll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they're gone. It's a lonely experience. Most people don't discuss miscarriages because you worry your problems will distance you or reflect upon you -- as if you're defective or did something to cause this. So you struggle on your own. In today's open and connected world, discussing these issues doesn't distance us; it brings us together. It creates understanding and tolerance, and it gives us hope.""

582,The Smith effect: Local United Way's much-loved leader to retire from service agency after 26 years,"CLOSE Lee County Campaign Chairs Beth Hendry and John Clinger talk about why this year's campaign in the most important in the United Way's Southwest Florida history. Craig Handel

Southwest Florida’s nonprofit community is bracing for tears and tributes as it tries to figure out how it’s going to function without Cliff Smith. In July, Smith, 63, will retire, saying it's time.

For more than a quarter-century he has led one of the most successful United Ways in the nation. His tall, bespectacled presence has been a reassuring constant in the day-to-day lives of myriad agencies that rely on his chapter for funding.

Smith oversees an annual collection of donations from companies, gated communities and individuals, which go to a range of thoroughly vetted nonprofits in the four-county area – groups like Girl Scouts of Gulfcoast Florida, Quality Life Center and SalusCare.

When Smith arrived in 1993, his budget was $1 million. Last year’s was more than $10.3 million, a mark the group exceeded by more than $100,000. It was the 26th consecutive year the agency has met or topped its goal – the 26 years Smith has been at the helm. In total, he’s raised more than $157 million in campaign donations, averaging an 8% annual increase. And he’s expanded the umbrella's reach. Once serving Lee County alone, Smith's United Way, which he routinely calls ""ourUnited Way,"" has grown to include Hendry, Glades and Okeechobee counties, while garnering both a four-star rating and a perfect score on Charity Navigator, which rates fiscal responsibility.

On Smith’s watch, his group rolled out United Way houses, which offer multiple health and social services in one place; United Way 211, a 24/7 helpline that connects callers to more than 700 registered and screened programs; and he’s pioneered leadership giving programs that have offset the region’s lack of huge employers, which United Ways in many other regions lean on for support. That support now accounts for 44% of the group's annual donations.

And he’s done it all with his trademark low-key style, never snatching the spotlight for himself, but instead, elevating others, said Sarah Owen, CEO of the Southwest Florida Community Foundation, who calls him an “incredible shaper of our region.”

Joe Catti, president and CEO of FineMark National Bank and Trust, has known Smith for years, and has twice chaired annual fund drives.

""I believe in the United Way, and I’m heavily involved with it, which is driven because of Cliff’s leadership,"" Catti said "" What draws me to him is his totally unselfish nature. He is so genuine with everything he does.""

Catti, like Owen, sees Smith as a model of sincerity.

“He’s been such an inspiration in this community,” Owen said. “Cliff has this unique ability to always lift other people up. I don’t think I ever heard him give a speech, make a passing comment in a meeting or be at a community event where he didn’t shower the credit on other people.”

Even before he started, Smith was talking collaboration and frugality. Hired by a search committee in 1993, he was charged with turning around a floundering United Way that had fallen more than $340,000 short of its goal and had to cut staff. Before his first day on the job, Smith told The News-Press he was looking forward to working with “good people to do good things for the community … I always plan on using volunteers to the maximum extent possible to help keep administrative costs low.”

Linda Uhler was on the search committee that hired Smith. ""There were several things that stood out to us in reviewing Cliff’s resume and recommendations,"" she wrote in an email. ""One was that, at the time, his United Way was the only one in New England that reached its goal for the prior five years with increases each year ranging from 5% to 18%. This was in spite of a recession and negative national publicity."" (National leader, William Aramony, had resigned in disgrace the year before, and was later indicted on multiple counts of fiscal malfeasance.)

But Smith quickly set things right, then charted an upward course that's continued to this day. Yet ask him about how he turned things around and regularly gets such enviable results, he brushes off the credit. ""I have an absolutely charmed life,"" he said.

Pressed, he will allow there's more to success than luck. ""I'm a big believer you do things as a team, and I've been fortunate that our network of agencies is absolutely amazing and we should do everything we can to be truly great partners because the success of our United Way is tied to the success of our agencies. When they succeed, we succeed.""

He also credits his ""unbelievably not only experienced and skilled but passionate"" staff, as well as the board members, volunteers, community members and donors ""who make our United Way the phenomenal organization it is.""

Yet try as he might to deflect the credit, those who know him place it squarely at Smith's feet. Retired Lee Health President Jim Nathan has worked closely with Smith for years. He recalls looking at a chart of United Way's performance that made the Smith effect plain.

“The graph was from an earlier time frame before Cliff had arrived,” Nathan said, “and it was clear … there’s a definite shift in the curve on that graph from the time Cliff arrived, and it just takes off from there.”

Nathan, Smith and Catti took morning runs together for years, and it was during those early morning sessions that the trio brainstormed and shaped innovative ways to help the community.

Nathan recalls one such run that led to a pioneering health program for financially challenged patients that’s now among the biggest and most successful in the world.

“Joe and Cliff and I were jogging together and we’re having a conversation about the fact that we had had a (health care) program that in this community … that had pretty much collapsed.” To be successful, it needed both volunteer physicians and coordination. “So we realize Joe has a relationship with the doctors because of doing business with FineMark and Cliff has the relationships on the human service (and) so we ended up basically resurrecting the We Care program,” Nathan said.

Catti quickly convened a dinner meeting with the doctors, who all agreed to participate, he said. ""I was honored to be able to help.""The program is thriving still, and, the last that we knew,"" Nathan said, ""it was one of, if not the largest in the nation, and could well be the largest in the world.”

That project exemplifies what Nathan calls Smith’s “energy and can-do willingness.” Those who work most closely with Smith see it too.

The secret of Smith’s success, says Vice President of Resource Development and Marketing, Jeannine Joy, “has always been his enormous capacity to care for others,” she said. “Cliff truly loves this community and cares about the success of our residents.""

Joy calls him a fantastic leader – the kind she's watched answering calls on the storm hotline in the middle of the night during a hurricane, she said.

""He is a legacy in the United Way system and a true hero in my eyes.""

583,Airbag issue raising concern; millions of cars could be affected,"A new airbag concern.



A federal agency is now investigating malfunctioning airbag controls that might not allow the airbag in your car to deploy in a crash.

""I think it should be looked at. It's kinda scary, pretty terrifying,"" said Jobeth Chay, a concerned driver.



Chay, who lives in West Palm Beach, is the proud mother of a 3-week-old baby girl, Bailey.

She’s a high school U.S. History teacher.

Chay could be one of millions of drivers affected by what one federal agency says are possible issues with airbag controls that might cause the airbag not to deploy in a crash.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is expanding an investigation into airbags that may affect 12.3 million vehicles. The NHTSA says the airbags may be linked to eight deaths and can fail in a crash.



Chay says she was in a head on crash a year-and-a-half ago, where one of the airbags did not deploy.

Luckily, she had only minor injuries.

""If there is a possibility that the airbags won't deploy, someone should definitely be looking into it because it's not just our lives at stake, it's our children's,"" Chay said.

The NHTSA says the brands affected by this airbag investigation include Chrysler, Honda, Hyundai, KIA, Mitsubishi and Toyota 2010-2019 models.

Authorities say the airbags may not deploy in a crash because of unwanted electrical signals or malfunctioning crash sensors.

A new worry for people like Chay.

""It's a little terrifying now, especially since I have a 3-week-old,"" she said.

Chay says she plans to call the car dealership or bring her van in to find out what they plan to do about this airbag issue. She’d rather be safe than sorry.

CBS12 News wanted to know— what can drivers do?



CBS12 News checked with Mike Munson, who owns Munson’s Auto Service in Mangonia Park.



""If this is not sending the signal to the module, the airbag is not gonna deploy,"" he said. ""It is a dangerous situation. It should be really looked at serious. But there's no reason not to drive your car. Just be a little more cautious driving your car.""

Munson says if you choose to have this airbag issue fixed yourself and pay it out of your own pocket, he says the cost could run from $400 to $1,000.



If you wait until there’s a recall, then the manufacturer pays for it and the repair would be free.",http://cw34.com/news/local/airbag-issue-raising-concern-millions-of-cars-could-be-affected,2019-04-25T21:02:36Z,WTVX,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407
584,Naples couple's rescue of shelter pup to be featured on CBS's 'Lucky Dog',"Lizzie is a lucky dog. She is lucky to have escaped the California wildfires, lucky to be cared for in a shelter, lucky to get top training, and lucky to find new owners in Naples.

Now the 2-year-old border terrier is scheduled to be featured on the CBS TV show “Lucky Dog” this Saturday at 12:30 p.m.

The show features animal trainer Brandon McMillan, who rescues difficult to love and untrained dogs from animal shelters. At his Lucky Dog Ranch, McMillan tackles the task of transforming the dogs into model pets. Each episode features a hopeless-to-home story of a dog and the family that adopts the canine.

Lizzie was adopted in September by Linda and Jim Hansen who live at Naples Lakes Country Club. She was a dog the Hansen’s never thought they would get.

Five years ago the couple lost their 17-year-old dog. They didn’t want the hassle of training a new puppy.

“So I was watching 'Lucky Dog' and they train dogs,” Linda Hansen said.

She sent them an email and then filled out a lengthy application. Years went by and they heard nothing.

“Five years go by and I get an email that said, ‘You have been chosen,’” Linda Hansen said. “They sent us pictures and they said you can choose one from the pictures.”

The dog they chose had been sent back to a shelter.

“I said, ‘Go get that dog. That’s the one we want,’” Linda Hansen said.

Next came a very lengthy Skype session as McMillan tried to determine exactly what further training the 22-pound terrier needed. The Hansens have some hearing impairments so the canine was trained to alert them if the doorbell or phone rings.

“When the doorbell or the telephone rings she runs around in a circle,” Jim Hansen said.

The couple also enjoys boating, so Lizzie was taken on a boat to become accustomed to that lifestyle.

“We told them in our interview that we had an old sailboat in Doctors Pass so that is why they took her out on a boat in the Pacific to make sure she was not nervous getting in and out of a boat, and she just jumped in and out of the boat,” Jim Hansen said.

In September the Hansen’s flew to Los Angeles to fetch Lizzie and to be filmed for the show. Production crews came to Naples a few weeks ago to get additional footage of Lizzie in her new home.

Lizzie lives a lucky life in Naples.

“She is up at seven o’clock in the morning almost like an alarm clock,” Jim Hansen said. “She licks my nose. We get on the golf cart. I have a 16-foot extension leash and she runs alongside the golf cart.

""She runs very, very fast. She runs all the way around the circle almost two miles. She does her doggie things. Then she has her breakfast and then lies down and goes to sleep.”

In the afternoon it’s either another golf cart run or a walk.

“In the evening we will take her out and then she loves to sit on the raised spa by the swimming pool and watch the sun setting,” Jim Hansen said. “Every night she will watch the sun go down.”

She watches television with her owners and then has a bedtime routine.

“She goes to sleep on my shoulder in bed, and when I fall asleep she gets down and burrows under the bed,” Jim Hansen said, explaining that border terriers are instinctive burrowers.

Lizzie follows commands immediately. She knows, ""sit,"" ""stay,"" ""come,"" ""no,"" and more.

“Never in my life did I think I could get a dog like this,” Linda Hansen said. “She is highly trained. No problems, no messes.”

The Hansens are excited about all the adventures they have had and the people they met while filming the show.

“They were here for six hours last month,” Jim Hansen said. “They took us down to our sailboat and filmed us on the sailboat so some of those scenes will be on the show, too. We look forward to seeing which scenes they took will be in the show. After the show she will just go back to being a house dog.”

""Lucky Dog"" premiered in September 2013. Since then almost 150 episodes have aired. In 2015 McMillan won the Daytime Emmy for best host for a lifestyle series. The show received a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Special Class Series in 2016.

While the Hansen’s feel lucky to have Lizzie, they also say Lizzie is lucky in so many ways.

“With all those fires in California, there were a lot of animals,” Jim Hansen explained. “She was running around on the streets when they (the shelter) got her. This was when a lot of dogs were displaced from the fires. One other thing that makes her lucky is we flew out to Los Angeles and got her and a week later that huge fire went through the hills. So she escaped two in a row.”

That is how Lizzie got her name. Linda Hansen said her dog’s full name is Elizabeth, named after Elizabeth in the television show Madam Secretary. But she is called Lizzie because of her history.

“She is lucky Lizzie,” Jim Hansen said.

586,'She was beautiful and she was good': Family mourns 8-year-old killed in storm,"WOODVILLE — Good Friday was supposed to be a fun day off, a ""cheat day"" for Joe Weinman and his four kids.

School was out for the district-wide spring holiday, and while his wife Sara had to work, he had time off from his job at Crickets Tree Service, too. A line of fast-moving thunderstorms coming through that morning were to give way to a beautiful day.

“I was happy. I was sitting there thinking, the fishing poles are in the shed,"" said Weinman, ""I was thinking, 'Well great, I’ve got a cheat day.' We had really big plans for Sunday morning for Easter.”

Normally, 8-year-old Mariah Juliette Weinman and her two brothers — 14-year-old Kyle and 12-year-old Austin — would have been on their way at about 8 a.m. to Woodville's combined elementary and middle school. Instead they sat on the couch inside the Old Woodville Road mobile home they shared with their parents and 20-year-old sister, Kayla, waiting for the storms to pass.

""I just heard a crack,"" Joe Wineman recalled. ""A branch hit outside near our little fire pit near the house, then the whole house just imploded.""

An oak tree had crashed through their roof. Inside the mobile home, there was chaos, insulation flying everywhere.

“I just started yelling everybody’s name,” Joe said. “The first one to answer was Kyle, then Kayla. Austin came out of his room then stopped because everything was broken. Then I started screaming for Mariah.”

The second-grader wasn't there.

The yells of a neighbor sank Joe’s heart. He rushed out the back door and found his daughter's body. She'd been propelled out of the house by a giant limb.

Joe carried his youngest daughter to his truck tailgate as medical officials arrived and whisked her away to the hospital.

Miles away in Monticello, Sara, in a panic, rushed to get home, trying to start her car's push-button ignition with a key before a co-worker gave her a ride. On the way, she made desperate phone calls trying to find out what happened to her daughter.

“I can’t put the words to what I was going through,” Sara said. “One minute, I was terrified. The next minute I was hoping and praying, please let everything be all right.”

At the hospital, exuberant, intelligent Mariah was pronounced dead, killed by the impact.

“I kept hoping there would be some miracle in the back of the ambulance,” Joe Weinman said. “I think I already knew.”

‘A sassy little 8-year-old’

On Easter, instead of meeting as planned with more than a dozen family members at Lake Bradford for a kayaking trip and picnic, they met on the beach in St. Marks to light candles and watch the sunset.

Everyone wore pink, Mariah’s favorite color.

Her family called her “Roo.” She was a bubbly, adventurous and fearless kid, her parents said, inseparable from her siblings. She did well in school and was recognized for her citizenship both at Woodville and Springwood Elementary, her previous schools.

Like her mother, Mariah loved the '80s heavy metal hair band Motley Cru. She rocked out to their blaring tunes on brightly-colored Jojo Siwa headphones.

“Our 8-year-old daughter is sitting there, listening to 'Dr. Feelgood' and 'Smoking in the Boys Room,' because she’ s mom’s girl and she’s going to get into everything that mom loves,” Joe said.

“I’m sure they would be proud,"" Sara chimed in, “I’m proud.”

Her parents described Mariah as a fearless, fun, all-in kid.

Swimming by the time she was 4, unafraid of the deep end of the pool. A lover of sharks and beach fishing, just a few weeks before her death, reeling in more fish than everyone. A fan of the movies ""Jaws"" and “Nightmare on Elm Street,” an admirer of WWE wrestler Alexa Bliss — the proud owner of her own Wonder Woman blanket.

“She’s just a sassy little 8-year-old,” Joe said.

When her older siblings didn’t want to ride roller coasters at Wild Adventures in Valdosta, Mariah was first in line next to her dad.

“She was on every single adult roller coaster that she could get on. In the front seat,” Sara said. “Came off smiling.”

When she was younger, she came up with the word “shwaybie” to describe Disney princesses, but the funny sounding word came to mean different things depending on her tone. She used it when she was happy and when she was upset. It showed her silly, sweet side.

“She was beautiful and she was good,” Sara said. “Everybody that knew her is going to remember her that way.""

'We need them just as much as they need us'

In the days since their daughter’s death, financial help, condolences and support from the community has been overwhelming — but appreciated. A GoFund me page has raised more than $17,000.

“It’s just unreal, you can’t put the words to it how much these people we don’t even know, now it feels like they’re all somewhat a part of us in a sense,” Sara said. “How do we express that much thanks?”

As a tree service worker, Joe found himself helping grieving people who felt hopeless in tornadoes in both Hurricanes Hermine and Michael.

This time his co-workers came to his aid.

“I said, I can’t start moving forward until that tree is out of my house. They looked at me and said, ‘It’s done,’” he said.

After they cleared the tree and the family’s personal belongings from the demolished house, the men came to the hospital to pay their respects and let the Weinmans know they had a clean slate to begin making sense of what happened.

“I don’t know now if I know what to do,"" Joe said. “In some small way, I’m really glad that the house is destroyed because I don’t want to go back in there.”

But the Weinmans don't plan on leaving Woodville.

“This is home, our family is here. I need the friends at work. I need the friends who are going to cry with me and understand. We need them just as much as they need us,"" he said.

Their sons are trying to come to grips with the death of their sister. They were there when the tree came through and at the hospital when doctors solemnly announced they couldn’t save Mariah. They wanted to go back to school and be with friends.

“Our biggest thing now is we do have to parent. We have three kids that need us.”

'One day at a time'

Four days after Mariah's death, families gathered at Woodville Elementary School Tuesday evening for the end of year Spring Music Program.

(Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

Mariah’s family sat in the first row watching while the children performed. First graders sang about colors, second graders about animals. Sara and Joe smiled through their tears.

During intermission, Woodville principal Dr. Lisa Mehr asked for a moment of silence and presented the family with pink flowers to plant in their yard along with an envelope full of cards made by Mariah’s peers.

When Mariah's second grade class began singing, Sara wiped away her tears, rested her head on her husband’s shoulder and rubbed Austin’s back. They listened to the songs Mariah had been practicing.

At every turn, there is a feeling she should be there.

“She’s everywhere. We went to the Waffle House,” Joe said tearfully. ""I’m not supposed to tell those people (table for) five. I’m supposed to tell them six.”

A week after Mariah's death, her parents' emotions swing like a pendulum. Memories of family times bring laughter and tears. They are still living in a hotel and haven't yet figured out where they will put down new roots.

They are working to get to Saturday, when Mariah's funeral will be held.

“We’re trying to get through this week,” Sara said. “We’ll just take it one day at a time.”

587,"Pensacola father angry at teacher threatens to blow up elementary school, ECSO says","A 34-year-old Pensacola man was arrested last week after he allegedly threatened several times to blow up Lincoln Park Elementary School because he was upset over how a teacher treated his child.

Carlmontia Jones has been charged with making a false report of a bomb threat, explosive device or weapon of mass destruction. He was booked Thursday into the Escambia County Jail with a $10,000 bond.

The elementary school's administrative clerk told deputies that between 8 and 8:15 a.m. Thursday, Jones entered her office and demanded to see his child’s teacher, according to his arrest report.

The clerk said Jones became irate and starting cursing after being told the teacher was unavailable. Jones then allegedly demanded to see the principal, saying ""I will come back to this school and blow the (expletive) school up,"" according to the report.

The clerk let the principal know that a parent wanted to see her, and the principal invited Jones into her office and inquired about his problem, according to the report.

Jones told the principal he was furious about the behavior of his child’s teacher. He said that when his child falls asleep in class, the teacher makes the girl stand up, according to the report.

The principal told deputies that she tried to calm Jones down, and when he would not calm down, she asked him to leave. The principal said Jones left her office ""cursing, ranting and raving,"" the report states.

The principal also said that just before he stepped out her office, Jones threatened to come back and blow up the school, the report stated.

A teacher’s assistant who was in the school’s front office that morning told deputies that after Jones exited the principal’s office, he allegedly pointed at everyone in the front office and said he would blow them all up.

588,Here's why I... left the Republican Party to be a Democrat | Opinion,"Carolyn Perrine (Photo: Provided)

I grew up in a working class family in Orlando. I don’t recall politics ever being discussed. I wasn’t taught to be red or blue. No one belonged to a union. Voting was something done in private, if at all.

At 19 years old, I worked for a Fortune 100 company making decent money and bought my first house with my fiancé. I’d learned about progressive taxes, welfare mamas, and was a firm believer that pulling yourself up by your bootstraps was what made America great. I was a Republican.

It’s a funny thing what 30 years can do to a girl.

While working full time, I went to college at night. I worked hard at my studies and was drawn to American history. Unfortunately, my public school education had quite a few “gaps” and I was grateful for the opportunity to soak up our proud history.

A conservative view: Here's why I... wear a Make America Great Again cap

More: Here's why I ... learned to use a gun and now carry one

Instead, I was sickened by what I learned. Native American exterminations, lynchings, child labor, segregation, the Holocaust, the extreme poverty and indifference of the Depression, U.S. internment camps, Stonewall and, more recently, Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student who was beaten to death in 1998.

Much of this happened during my parents' or grandparents' lifetimes. When I was born, there were still segregated schools in America. This wasn’t ancient history. I looked around and realized the seismic vibrations from the past continued to affect every single person in the present.

Working at a large company put me in close contact with many types of people. What I observed was that hard work, contrary to what I believed, didn’t always equate to success. Departments closed down, hard workers lost their jobs. Our CEO raked in $52 million that year.

A friend who was laid off that year secured a position in another department. She wasn’t really a good employee. She came in late, left early, talked constantly and rarely did her work well. Why did she get that job instead of the black mother with 20 years experience, a college degree, and a work ethic that never quit?

I used to say that I didn’t see race. Laughably, I thought that was enlightened. I was so naïve I felt actual shock when I heard the hiring manager whispering my friend was preferred for the job because her skin color was a better “fit” for the department. That day, I learned what white privilege was. It wasn’t a term in our lexicon yet, but that didn’t make it any less real or make me feel any less shameful.

In my youth I was rather religious. I soaked up the teachings of Jesus through my pores: ""Do unto others;"" ""Love thy neighbor; ""Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves;"" Do not judge, lest ye be judged."" The more I saw, the more I started having trouble squaring up my moral teachings with my political ideas.

How could “they” have allowed the Holocaust to happen?

How could “they” not allow men like Matthew Shepard to love who they love?

How could “they” have allowed U.S. citizens, entire families, to be rounded up and placed in internment camps?

How could “they” have allowed hard working black mothers to be fired and a silly, frivolous, sorry excuse for an employee be given a job instead?

Eventually, my education and experiences led me to the realization that “they” were “us.” When I made the leap in logic to understand that collectively we must do better, I realized I was no longer a Republican.

Though I now know that we all have a higher responsibility to each other, I am not naive enough to assume our country can make these changes without many people being compelled or, at the very least, urged along the way. Some people eschew government intervention. I welcome it. It is the method by which we all can fairly contribute to this great country. It is how we spread the risk, care for the weak, uphold the law, ensure equal rights. It is patriotism at its finest.

So, today I not only help my fellow Americans with my vote, but I work on campaigns and in party offices to convince others that not only is America already great, but so are they. We prove it by our actions and deeds every single day that “they” are “us” and that we love our neighbors as much as Jesus would have.

589,FL House OK's distracted driving bill sponsored by Tampa Rep. Jackie Toledo,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - The Florida House of Representatives passed a distracted driving bill Tuesday, co-sponsored by Tampa representative Jackie Toledo.

House Bill 107 makes texting while driving a primary offense. Currently in Florida, texting while driving is a secondary offense, meaning drivers cannot be pulled over for that alone.

Much of the legislative push to end distracted driving in Florida is inspired by the Scherer family, formerly of Riverview. Their 9 year old son Logan died in 2016 when the family's SUV was rear-ended by a driver using his phone on I-75 south of Brooksville.

""You just don't think it will happen to you, and then it does,"" Brooke Scherer said.

Since their son's untimely death, Brooke and Jordan Scherer have dedicated their lives to ending distracted driving through the Living for Logan Foundation. The Scherers played a pivotal role in both Toledo's distracted driving bill, as well as a companion bill still being weighed in the Senate.

Senate Bill 76, if passed, doesn't just elevate texting while driving to a primary offense. It would also mandate all hands-free phone use while behind the wheel.

The Scherers support any crackdown on distracted driving, and say they fully support Rep. Toledo's efforts, but fear the bill passed by the House Tuesday may have enforceability issues due to watered down language.

""If you're law enforcement, and you go to pull over one of those people for 'texting and driving,' you're going to have absolutely no way to tell, no way of knowing what any of those people were actually doing,"" Jordan Scherer said Tuesday in reaction to the bill's passing.

The Scherers would like to see Florida go completely hands-free, as the Senate version of the bill aims to do. They hope the Senate bill will pass, and that lawmakers will then reconcile both bills to make hands-free the law of the land.

As they move forward in their fight for a hands-free Florida, the Scherers are also moving forward in their lives. They're expecting a baby girl this August, a gift they believe was sent to them by their son.

""I think he'd be a huge champion of what we're trying to do,"" Jordan Scherer said. ""The mission we ultimately feel he has left us.""

The Florida Senate is expected to take up its distracted driving bill on Wednesday.

590,'I can't contact the woman I love': Man accused of killing Chuluota family pens letter,"0 'I can't contact the woman I love': Man accused of killing Chuluota family pens letter

CHULUOTA, Fla. - New evidence was submitted Tuesday in the case of a Chuluota man accused of killing his parents and brother in their home.

The evidence is a letter Grant Amato wrote to the girlfriend of a pod mate at the Seminole County jail.

The handwritten letter is six pages long and addressed to Ryan Cooney, of Parish, Florida. Cooney is the girlfriend of a fellow inmate of Amato at the Seminole County jail.

“Hello Ryan, my name is Grant. I have become somewhat of a celebrity for something I never did and something that has robbed me of my entire family and life,” the letter starts.

Amato goes on to open up about his own love life involving an online Bulgarian call girl named Silvie—the same woman for whom prosecutors say Amato stole more than $200,000 from his parents and brother to pay.

Investigators allege Amato killed his parents and brother after he was kicked out of their Chuluota home for continuing to contact her.

“I am sure you have heard the terrible things about me and my girlfriend that the media have lied about. Unfortunately for me, I can’t contact the woman I love while I’m in here,” he wrote. “I know the pain of being separated from the woman you love.”

Amato even wrote about the possibility of a future double date, writing, “We have even decided to take a cruise once all this jail stuff is behind us (you and him with my girl and I).”

Amato will be back in court Thursday, where he again will ask a judge to reconsider pre-trial release.

591,Report: Woman who fatally stabbed 11-year-old daughter punches officer in jail cell,"ORLANDO, Fla. - A Florida woman accused of killing her 11-year-old daughter to keep her from having sex with men attacked a corrections officer at the Orange County Jail, according to a report.

Orange County officials said Rosa Alcides Rivera, 28, punched the officer earlier this month when the officer entered Rovera's jail cell to check on her after hearing a report of a possible injured inmate, the report said.

The officer said Rivera had just taken her IV out against orders and was sitting in her cell before she stood up and hit the officer on the left side of her face.

Rivera is facing charges of battery on a corrections officer, in addition to first-degree murder charges she faced in connection with her daughter's death last month.

Authorities said Rivera stabbed her daughter, Aleyda, at least 15 times in a car March 10 and drove her around before bringing her to a hospital in Orlando. By then, the child was already dead, officials said.

Deputies with the Orange County Sheriff's Office said the incident began after Rivera accused her mother's boyfriend of having sex with her daughter. Witnesses told officers that the girl had denied having sex with him, the affidavit said.

According to officials, Rivera said she killed her daughter to prevent her from having sexual relations with men. She said she believed her daughter was having sex with men because she ""smiled different,"" according to the affidavit.

Orange County Sheriff John Mina said there appeared to be no validity to Rivera's claim that her daughter was sexually active.

593,"Kids complain of 'creature' in bedroom, parents later find opossum","Children often imagine make-believe monsters or a bump in the night before bedtime.

When an Ohio mom was woken up by her daughters’ complaints about a “creature” or “rat” in their room last summer, she told them it was probably nothing.

Caitlin Burch said her then 6-year-old insisted there was something lurking late at night in the room she shared with her older sister. Caitlin Burch and her husband, Bryan Burch, did a full search of the bedroom several times, but found no rodents or vermin.

Caitlin Burch assumed it was a mouse, telling BuzzFeed News they live in a rural area north of Columbus.

Despite the mouse traps set in the girls’ room, the youngest girl refused to sleep in the room with her sister, opting instead for the guest room.

Three days after the initial scare, the Burches say their oldest daughter ran into their room screaming about an opossum sighting around 2 a.m.

Their father reluctantly got out of bed and searched the closet.

He says he found the opossum inside one of the dresses hanging in the closet with its head peeking out of the neck hole.

The oldest daughter said she had been watching the opossum circle around the room several times before she got the courage to make a run for it and get her parents’ help.

Their father raced to catch the marsupial, while their mother snapped pictures.

A photo showing the opossum in an arts and crafts container, went viral when Caitlin Burch replied to a tweet from Chrissy Teigen about a hamster on the loose in her home.

594,Man accused of burning girlfriend's son also faces molestation charge,"<p>A man who was arrested Sunday on an aggravated child abuse charge after his girlfriend's son was seriously burned while in his care now faces a molestation charge for a separate incident, authorities said.</p>

<p>According to an arrest report, a 6-year-old girl was interviewed by detectives Monday and said that Khalil Jabali, 23, touched her vagina over her clothing while she was lying on her mother's bed at their home in Miami Gardens.</p>

<p>Police said the incident occurred when the victim was 5.</p>

<p>During the interview, the girl was able to make a distinction between the truth and a lie, authorities said.</p>

<p>Local 10 News is withholding the relationship between Jabli and the victim to protect the child's identity.</p>

<p>Jabali remains in custody at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center.</p>

<p>According to a police report, Jabali was watching his girlfriend's three children Sunday while she was at work when the woman's 4-year-old son was burned by hot water that had been boiled in the microwave.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Police said Jabali called his girlfriend to tell her that the boy had wet his bed and was burned by hot water that he left in the bathroom when her younger child started crying.</p>

<p>Explaining that he had boiled water in the microwave so he could wash the boy's wet clothes, Jabali told police he left a bowl of hot water on the bathroom sink while he was in another room checking on the other child. When he returned to the bathroom, Jabali said he found the boy on the floor moaning and his skin peeling off.</p>

<p>The boy's mother left work and, along with Jabali, took her son to Jackson North Medical Center. He was then transferred to the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.</p>

<p>Police said the boy had burns to 15 percent of his body.</p>

<p>""They do not know if he is going to survive, and if he does he will likely be in a vegetative state,"" a prosecutor told Miami-Dade County Judge Renatha Francis during Jabali's bond hearing Monday morning.</p>

<p>Police said the boy had other injuries, including bleeding around the brain and the chest cavity and broken ribs. </p>

<p>The prosecutor said paramedics were never called.</p>

<p>Francis initially set Jabali's bond at $10,000. She also ordered him to remain on house arrest upon his release and to stay at least 500 feet away from the child.</p>

<p>However, Jabali reappeared in court Tuesday, at which time Francis ordered him held without bond due to the new charge. He was also ordered to have no contact with either victim. </p>",https://www.local10.com/news/florida/miami-dade/man-accused-of-burning-girlfriends-son-also-faces-molestation-charge,2019-04-23T14:53:15Z,WPLG,Couple,"3401 W Hallandale Beach Blvd, Pembroke Park, FL 33023, USA",FL,33023

A North Port man was thrown from his vehicle and killed and four passengers, including a five-year-old girl, were injured in a crash Saturday night on U.S. 41 in North Fort Myers.

The Florida Highway patrol said the man was driving a 2000 Jeep Wrangler south on 41 near Avenue A shortly after 10 p.m.

None of those involved were identified pending the FHP's notification of next-of-kin.

The SUV continued south and hit the median curb, traveled off 41 and overturned multiple times. The Jeep ended up in a ditch and the driver was ejected from the vehicle.

A 30-year-old female passenger and the five-year-old girl, both from North Port, suffered critical injuries and were taken to Lee Memorial Hospital. Two other male juveniles, ages 8 and 11 and also from North Port, suffered minor injuries and were taken to Lee Memorial.

The FHP said the driver was not wearing a seat belt and it was unknown if the woman and the girl were wearing seat belts. The two male juveniles were wearing seat belts.

The crash remains under investigation.

The death is the 39th traffic fatality in Lee County for 2019.

TAMPA (WFLA) - Two teens are being called heroes after they rescued two children from rip currents while on Spring Break.

Alex Byrd, 16, and Tyler Brueck,17 were enjoying their spring break at Melbourne Beach ahead of their lacrosse camp in Port St.Lucie.

While boogie boarding the boys heard screams according to Alex's father David. The teens heard another child yelling ""help me"" and sprung into action hoping to rescue a young boy and girl approximately 6 and 8 years old.

The boys were able to pull the two children out of a rip current and carry them to shore. Both kids were shaken up according to Alex's Father but were both conscious.

A lifeguard was able to meet up with the teens and children on the beach soon after they were out of the water. The mother of the two children was tearful as she thanked and hugged Alex and Tyler. The family left the beach soon after, however, the teens never got their names or where they were from.

601,"A wealthy developer, a local actress, a failed hotel project and an indecent proposal","Palm Beach actress Mia Matthews is busy these days rehearsing in New York City for the upcoming off-Broadway premiere of “After,"" a play about the consequences of a bullying text message.

Off stage, she’s immersed in another emotional production involving texts, this one a bizarre personal drama with one of her biggest admirers — Palm Beach Polo President Glenn Straub.

It’s a drama with salacious allegations detailed in court records, including one ripped from a Hollywood script: In what amounted to an indecent proposal, Straub, who has known Matthews and her husband, Robert “Bob” Matthews, for 20 years, is alleged to have said he let a $27 million mortgage go unpaid “every time Bob let him sleep with Mia.""

Straub denied making any such proposal, although he has engaged in business deals with the Matthewses over the years, including a last-minute loan that saved their Nantucket summer home from foreclosure in 2010.

But he admits sending Mia flirtatious text messages last year, sometimes as a joke, including one with a reference to oral sex. He also bought her earrings, took her to a Broadway show, offered to pay her daughter's tuition, gave loaner cars to the family and provided $300,000 to help Mia and Bob hire criminal lawyers, according to court records.

Those apparent extensions of generosity came at a time when Mia and her husband were desperate and vulnerable: They had been targeted and later charged in a federal fraud investigation into a failed Palm Beach hotel project.

Prosecutors were building a case that Bob, Mia and others had misused millions of dollars that was supposed to be spent to renovate the Palm House Hotel, court records show. The money had been pledged through a federal program by foreign investors seeking green cards.

Bob and Mia are accused of spending some of that money on mortgage and tax payments for their homes and lavish indulgences, such as a yacht, luxury cars and a Paris vacation on a private plane, according to prosecutors.

Bob was among four men, including his brother, arrested in March on multiple fraud charges. As the Palm House scandal swirled in the months before Mia’s arrest in August on a single count of tax evasion, Straub pursued her for an intimate relationship and told her to leave her husband, according to text messages described in court records and a provocative legal argument targeting Straub.

But when Mia refused his advances, he sued her and Bob demanding they return the money he said he loaned them for their lawyers. He also filed a separate lawsuit against the Connecticut law firm representing Bob Matthews, demanding the return of the $150,000 retainer Palm Beach Polo had wired in May.

Mia is not the first female friend Straub has taken to court. Since 2013, five former girlfriends, all significantly younger than Straub, have been sued by his companies over alleged broken debts, The Palm Beach Post reported in November. Two of those women said the lawsuits are frivolous and accused Straub of suing only because they broke up with him.

Although Mia never accused Straub in court records of suing for romantic revenge, lawyers in a Palm House bankruptcy case say he filed the lawsuit just days after she rebuffed his advances.

In court records, Mia said $150,000 of the money “was not a loan but was instead a gift” provided by Straub “without expectation of repayment."" Similar claims were made by other women who have been sued by him.

Straub dismissed the lawsuit against Bob and Mia on Jan. 28 after he said they “paid a good chunk of it back,"" he told The Post. His lawsuit against Bob Matthews’ criminal law firm was settled in December, a few weeks after a Connecticut judicial panel dismissed a professional grievance that Straub had filed against the firm.

Straub, 72, denies having ever been anything more than just a “close friend” to Mia, 52.

In August, he offered a different take on Mia to an FBI agent. Straub considered Mia “an instigator” who drove her husband ""to the ‘high life'” and Bob “'a ‘salesman’ who used ‘every tactic’ to keep Mia happy in the lifestyle,"" according to an FBI memo shown during a Palm House bankruptcy trial.

Bob, 61, and Mia, who each pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges, both declined to comment for this story. Mia referred questions to her attorney, Brian Spears of Connecticut, who declined to comment.

Bob and Mia certainly were aware of Straub’s litigious history — they’d been sued by him at least once before, in 2010 over the Nantucket loan. But with the Palm House scandal engulfing them, they had no other choice but to lean on the wealthy businessman for help.

“(I)f you look at Wikipedia under Glenn Straub it says most litigious person in South Florida,"" Bob Matthews said at a Securities and Exchange Commission hearing in January 2017.

“I mean, Glenn loves to have coffee with you in the morning, sue you in the afternoon and play tennis with you in the evening. He has this thing where it’s fun. He loves going to court.""

‘Famous signer’ in the USA

Mia’s smiling face once briefly adorned an electronic billboard in Times Square, an image used in a Palm House promotional brochure sent a few years ago to potential investors in China, Iran and Turkey.

The brochures claimed, erroneously, according to federal prosecutors, that former President Bill Clinton, singer Tony Bennett and other celebrities had pledged to be members of the Palm House Club “due in part to the fame of Mia Matthews, the developer Robert Matthews’ wife. Mia Matthews is a famous signer"" — the word “singer” is misspelled — “and entertainer in the USA.""

How famous? That’s up for interpretation. But by most accounts, Mia has enjoyed a modestly successful career.

She had an uncredited appearance as a bartender in a 1997 episode of Michael J. Fox’s “Spin City” and she enjoyed a 52-episode run playing a witch called Desdemona in Nickelodeon’s “Every Witch Way” in 2014-15.

Her website mentions films, brief television roles on a Fox’s “13 Bourbon Street” and the short-lived Hulu series “South Beach,” along with appearances on David Letterman and in TV commercials for Old Navy and the Florida Lottery.

She won a regional acting award for her performance in 2016 in a Miami play, and she can be seen in YouTube clips singing and cartwheeling in “The Bombshell Show,” in which she portrays iconic singers.

Straub said he has attended some of Mia’s performances. Watching her cartwheel across the stage during “The Bombshell Show” a few years ago made an impression on the wealthy developer.

“I knew of her because she was an actress and I’d seen her at different events and she’d do that cartwheel,"" Straub, who has been divorced since 2009, said in a deposition. Her “claim to fame is that she does a cartwheel, a perfect cartwheel, on stage.""

Since Mia married Bob in 1997, she enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle with homes in Palm Beach, Nantucket and Connecticut. In recent years, they were members of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a Lago Club, the Breakers and the Kravis Center, and Mia drove luxury cars such as an Aston Martin, Maserati and Mercedes Hummer, according to statements her husband’s bookkeeper gave to SEC investigators in 2016.

Photos of Mia and Bob on Nantucket with the Clintons, actor Alec Baldwin and the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy — photo ops made decades ago through her husband’s business and political connections — were included in Palm House promotional material.

More recently, she has mingled at Palm Beach society events with Trump, Palm Beach billionaire Bill Koch, golfer Greg Norman and, of course, Straub.

‘A father figure’

No stranger to controversy, Straub is a proud, hard-nosed businessman with a talent for mining gold from distressed properties and a penchant for butting heads with opponents big and small. He can be pugnacious and polarizing — in January, he was accused of making racially insensitive comments at a Wellington Village Council meeting.

He has forged connections to powerful people, including State Attorney Dave Aronberg, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath and President Trump, who also knows Mia. (In a deposition, Straub says Trump asked about Mia during a phone conversation Straub says he had with the president last summer.)

Straub doesn’t deny that he finds Mia attractive. “She raised two kids, she works and she is beautiful,"" he said.

But he said he always considered himself more as “a father figure” to her, a contention challenged by attorneys opposing Straub in the bankruptcy case. It is the bankruptcy case files, of all places, that contain the most salacious allegations about Straub’s “bizarre and influential” relationship with Mia and her husband.

Straub and Mia have had “a very complicated relationship"" that at some point was “intimate,"" according to allegations by attorney Phil Landau, who represents the entity that owns the Palm House property in the bankruptcy case filed in August.

Why else, he asked, would Straub continue doing business with Mia and her husband after he’d sued them for defaulting on a short-term $775,000 loan Straub gave in 2010 to save their Nantucket home from foreclosure?

That loan included an unusual stipulation, added by Straub, for Matthews to sell the home and put the proceeds into a trust for the benefit of Mia and the couple’s two daughters.

Then there’s the letter Straub wrote to federal prosecutors in June, three months after Bob Matthews was arrested and ordered to stop communicating with potential witnesses, Landau said.

In the letter, Straub asked prosecutors to make an exception for him, describing himself as “an acquaintance” of Bob Matthews and “a close friend” of Mia’s who needed to “provide moral support” since “all of the Matthewses’ other friends are avoiding them because of the indictment.""

Even though permission was granted, Straub said he hasn’t had too much communication lately with Bob Matthews. But he apparently has communicated plenty with Matthews’ wife.

Salacious text messages

Mia hasn’t said much publicly about her relationship with Straub. In fact, she invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 600 times in a deposition Nov. 26 when two lawyers grilled her for seven hours about flirtatious text messages Straub exchanged with her last year.

The actual texts are not included in court records. The only public description of their contents comes from a transcript of the attorneys reading them during the deposition, and those were only a sample of the texts Straub and Mia exchanged.

The text messages, the attorneys say, show that Straub either had or at least pursued a relationship with Mia that went beyond friendship, making him an “insider” who shouldn’t be allowed to seek claims in the Palm House bankruptcy.

“(A)s bad my situation is, I can’t accept your offer to be a significant other in order for you to drop the lawsuit,"" Mia texted Straub on July 16, more than a week after his company sued her and Bob.

“This whole thing is heartbreaking,"" her text continues. “I can’t say that we would end up together, but I will say any hopes of that are dashed with your recent actions and behavior. Being with someone who threatens to put me in jail, promises things, then takes them away, and tells me that he will do whatever he can to destroy me, won’t work. I wish things were different.""

But when the lawyers asked her to elaborate on those and other texts, her response was the same: “On advice of counsel, I’m exercising my rights under the Fifth Amendment and declining to answer the question.""

During the depositions, neither Mia, Straub nor their lawyers disputed the authenticity of the texts.

Texts earlier in the year suggest Mia made several requests to Straub — for a job, for money for her daughter’s acting class and for permission to use his credit card to go shopping.

Other texts suggest they attended a Broadway show. And in others, Straub appears to offer her an apartment in Aspen, Colo., and legal advice about her husband’s criminal case.

On July 3, Straub texted Mia a warning that he planned to sue her in St. Lucie County, an hour from Palm Beach County, to “keep these facts out of the public eyes and your daughter’s friends’ gossip. …"" In a deposition in November, Straub confirmed the text, saying, “That’s a little trick I got. To keep things out of the newspaper, I’ll sue in other counties.""

A month later, on Aug. 8, Mia sent Straub a text that Landau assumed was about her husband: “I talked to him. Told him the truth. He was relieved we didn’t have sexual contact. And understood my desperation in trying to get you to back off the lawsuit. …""

‘You anxious boy’

Other texts sound racy.

“Any interest in a dinner and sleepover party?” Straub asks May 20. Mia replies, “I have church at five. Could do dinner after but no sleepovers yet. You anxious boy.""

On June 18, Mia texted Straub about a pair of earrings she wanted to give to her daughter: “I think I may give her the little hoops you bought me. Is that okay with you?"" Straub replies, “Okay, as you know the prices of gold doubled, so I get one BJ for each side over three days.""

When Landau read those texts, an attorney for Straub’s lending company interjected. “Are you done? Is there a question there? I want to express my embarrassment on your behalf, Phil,"" said attorney Luis Salazar.

Landau replied, “And I’m embarrassed that we have to be here reading through this.""

In his own deposition three days later, Straub was asked if the “BJ” reference was meant as a colloquial term for oral sex.

“When you’re acting as a father figure to women, do you suggest that they should come and give you three BJs for something that you’re doing for them?” asked attorney David George, who represents 61 Palm House investors from China, Iran and Turkey who sued the Matthewses, Straub’s lending company and others in federal court in 2016.

Straub replied, “I do a lot of that kind of comments. To me, it’s like your first-born child. If you don’t pay me, you owe me a BJ. In other words, that’s very, very personal to people. They will usually pay you the money they owe you. …""

Straub admits he encouraged Mia to leave her husband, who is facing 325 years in prison if convicted on all counts, and to move to Aspen. But only so she can get a new start on her life, not to run off with him.

“You can interpret those texts to whatever you want. I never had sex with the girl,"" Straub said Nov. 29 in a deposition. “I’m saying to you, she always fascinated me that she was a worker like my daughters.""

Disputing the attorneys’ characterization, Straub said, “I wouldn’t call it an intimate relationship. It is a relationship with a woman that has got herself in trouble through her husband.""

Mia didn’t invoke the Fifth for every question during her seven-hour deposition. When Landau asked why she was crying, she replied, “My eyes are watering from yawning and from not getting a lot of, from work.""

Straub, who attended her deposition, interjected with a skeptical remark: “She’s an actress.""

‘Character assassination’

Perhaps the most explosive allegation about Straub and Mia was made by developer Ryan Black, a minority owner of Palm House, in an email to Landau on Aug. 29.

Describing a meeting he attended at Straub’s Wellington office in November 2014, Black said Straub was asked why he’d waited to foreclose on the Palm House mortgage five months after Matthews had started defaulting on payments.

Straub replied that “he would give Bob an extension every time Bob let him sleep with Mia,"" according to Black’s email, which is included in court records.

In an interview with The Post, Straub said, “I don’t remember ever, ever making that kind of remark. If I did, I’m sure it was a dumb joke. I’m a 72-year-old guy. I’m allowed to make some dumb-ass jokes.""

Black didn’t return a phone call and email from The Post.

Although Straub wasn’t asked about the Black email during his deposition, he was questioned about the “sleepover” text he’d sent Mia.

“I’d love to have her stay, spend some time with me, but she was always coy,"" he replied. “That’s why we never had sex. She’s been a player from day one.""

In court records, Salazar, the lawyer for Straub’s lending company, accused Landau of resorting to “a character assassination strategy” against Straub because he has a weak case.

“Debtor then makes up this deficit in substantive, relevant facts by dumping a truckload of tabloid fodder that might support newspaper sales in the checkout aisle but here amount to irrelevant tripe,"" Salazar said in an October filing.

None of the salacious allegations about Straub and Mia were mentioned in the time-limited, non-jury Palm House federal bankruptcy trial that ended Feb. 22 when a judge invalidated Straub’s mortgage claim on the hotel.

Meanwhile, Straub continues to deny accusations by Palm House investors in federal and state civil lawsuits that his lending company conspired with Matthews to steal their money.

Best supporting actress?

Barring another rescue from Straub, Bob and Mia won’t be living much longer at Casa Bendita, the spacious $30 million oceanfront mansion they built in 2006 next to a house owned until September by fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.

Once the scene of society galas and charity parties hosted by the couple, Casa Bendita — Spanish for “Blessed House” — is scheduled to be sold at an auction March 28 as part of Bob Matthews’ personal bankruptcy case.

A few months after that, Bob and Mia are scheduled to stand trial in Connecticut along with Palm Beach attorney Les Evans in the Palm House criminal case.

But before that trial, Mia will be judged on-stage April 8 at the 43rd Annual Carbonell Awards, which honor the best of South Florida theater.

She’s been nominated as best supporting actress for her role as Marie Antoinette in “The Revolutionists” at the Theatre Lab in Boca Raton. It’s not her first Carbonell nod.

In 2016, she won for her role in the Miami production of “After,” the same play she’s currently rehearsing for an off-Broadway run that starts March 17 and ends April 14.

Jessica Purcell is one tough mama.

She's a captain in the United States Army. She's served overseas on mutiple deployments in places like Afghanistan and Qatar.

She's faced dangerous situations before. But, it was her battle here at home with breast cancer where she found herself fighting for her life and the life of her newborn son.

""I just knew ultimately, this is God's will, God's way. Somehow, some way, it will, we can do this,"" she said, cradling her 5-week-old baby boy. He is her miracle.

When Jessica was 9-weeks pregnant, doctors gave her devastating news. She was diagnosed with breast cancer.

For this St.Petersburg mom who served in the military, perserverance and positivity became her ammo in battling the disease. ""We got this, somehow it's going to work out,"" she said with a sigh and a smile. ""Just keep the faith. Keep your hope. It's so mental.""

Jessica would need that mental strength and toughness as she endured a mastectomy and 12 rounds of grueling chemotherapy, all while pregnant.

At the same time, she and her husband were also raising their little girl, nearly two years-old. ""Just going through chemo alone is hard, being pregnant is hard. But, going through both, I just, you would never imagine doing that,"" she told us.

She explained how terrfiying it was to face chemotherapy while carrying her son. She says she sought multiple opinions from top oncologists all over the country and coupled their findings with extensive research she performed on her own.

She says she was told if she didn't seek chemotherapy treatment, she would most likely not survive to see her son or raise her daughter. She recalled the fear and crippling anxiety she felt wondering what her future held.

Jessica relied on her faith, friends, family and support groups comprised of other moms going through similar circumstances.

Then, came the joyous moment. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy in March.

But, because she couldn't breastfeed, Jessica wanted to give her little guy a boost to his immune system. A jump-start for baby Jameson.

So, she posted a plea on Facebook for breast milk.

""I'm like, 'Oh my goodness,'"" Jessica told us with a wide grin. ""This is, you know I mean. I have offers coming from around the world now, just to ship from other countires. I literally thought just the girls in St. Pete, maybe Tampa, would be a stretch.""

The mother of two says she's still in shock that her goal went global.

For now, she's focusing on feeding her son with donated breast milk from local moms and familiar faces. She says some moms have paid for extensive bloodwork when offering their milk, while others are close friends in which she has a history.

""It's wonderful, it's overwhelming. My freezer is full, I can actually feed my little guy,"" she said.

Jessica says she's pleasantly overwhelmed with the love and support she's received worldwide. It has warmed her heart and strengthened her mama bear spirit.

""I'm more excited than anything, I'm just so blessed,"" she told us. ""My little guy, he's here, just a breath of fresh air.""

Jessica has one more final chemo treatment, then she will soon begin radiation. She says her nurses at Moffitt Cancer Center keep her going, as does her moms' group.

""They're angels to me!""",http://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/ring-the-bell-brave-veteran-mom-battles-cancer-while-pregnant-final-chemo-day/1952247651,2019-04-25T06:39:09Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
608,Flag football: Godby finally wins district championship three years after intended,"The Cougars have been the best team the past four years during the regular season, but suffered season-ending defeats in the district-title game twice

Finally, Godby’s flag football didn’t choke away a district title.

For the past several seasons, the Cougars have been the area’s best team, at least as far as record and rankings are concerned.

Despite that, the past two years Godby has lost in the district championship game – first upset by FAMU DRS and then last year getting shut out by Lincoln.

This year, the Class 1A No. 2 Cougars played far from their best game against an undermanned Trojans team, but they came away a 19-6 winner on Wednesday night at Gene Cox Stadium.

DISTRICT SEMIFINALS: Godby, Lincoln advance to district championship game

It’s Godby’s first district title since 2016, but it was a mixed bag for head coach Chelsea Parmer on the performance that achieved the trophy.

“I don’t want to make excuses,” Parmer said. “We’re a team that feeds off energy and we had very low energy in warm-ups. We came out a little overconfident. We knew they’d be down some players and (Lincoln head coach Brandon) Youmans.

“Instead of coming out here and trying to bury them, we left it close. We didn’t execute. We played pretty poorly. We have a lot to fix.”

Lincoln (6-8) was down four key players for various reasons – injuries, suspensions, sporting conflicts – including quarterback/running back Erin Turral, who produced four touchdowns in a 32-0 win over Chiles on Monday.

Additionally, Youmans was serving the second part of his two-game suspension for a rules violation over the inadvertent clearance of a student-athlete who was coming back from a concussion.

Despite getting down 13-0, Lincoln picked up two interceptions by junior Ikia Washington, including one in the red zone on Godby’s first possession, and another by senior Kayley Farmer to start the fourth quarter.

Almost scoring on the play, Farmer's pick set up a touchdown pass from senior quarterback Ivy Zheng to receiver Riley French to pull within striking distance. After the Trojans' defense forced Godby to punt, Cougars sophomore Toni McClain got the ball back for her team with a leaping interception.

The Trojans just didn’t have enough in their arsenal to pull off the upset, and four interceptions allowed Godby the possessions needed to survive. Cougars senior defensive back Gisele Jones had two picks, one of which was in the end zone to stop a prime Lincoln scoring chance.

“We fight,” Farmer said. “I told my team that no matter the outcome I love them, but one thing to do, keep fighting. And they did. With all of them being out, it was tough adjusting. We had some people in that didn’t know what they were supposed to do. It was tough, but I’m proud of my girls and proud of my team.”

After throwing two interceptions early, Godby senior quarterback Kaylene Colburn bounced back. She hit senior receiver Armarni Williams on three deep balls, including one for a touchdown. Colburn also ran for two touchdowns and finished off the game with a leaping interception from her safety position.

“I think about my team and what they would want me to do,” Colburn said. “They inspire me to do better. I fight for them.

“Armarni really wanted it, like the team does. She put it all on the line and gave everything she had this week – in the Florida High game and this one. We fought for the team. We are one, so we fight for each other.”

Farmer, who recorded a second interception that was wiped out for a penalty, also played some run-first quarterback in Turral’s absence. The perennial All-Big Bend selection was sad to see her career end, but she was thankful for the memories, including last year’s district championship win.

“This four-year experience has been one of the best things to happen in my high school career,” Farmer said. “Flag football has been my sport since I was a little girl, so being able to play the game I love, it’s just an amazing feeling.”

Godby (13-1) now turns its attention to the only team it lost to this season. No. 13 Niceville (9-4) beat No. 5 Choctawhatchee 21-19 in their district final on a last-minute drive to capture its first district title.

The Eagles handed the Cougars a 10-6 defeat back in March. Godby played that game without Colburn.

“I think it benefits us to play Niceville,” Parmer said. “We know what they have and they didn’t see what we really have because we ran something different to compensate for not having our starting quarterback that night – even defensively, because she plays safety.”

When Godby has won district titles, it has preceded a long playoff run. The Cougars hope that will be the same this year.

In 2016, Godby won two playoff games before losing in the state semifinals by one point in overtime to now three-time defending Class 1A state champion Tampa Robinson.

It was a similar fate suffered during their previous other district championship, losing 7-0 to Robinson in the 2014 state semifinals.

“Moving forward, we need to be focused, have good energy, and execute,” Parmer said. “We’re a very good team. We have a lot of talent, a lot of experience. We can play with anybody in the state. We just can’t pick and choose who we’re going to get up for.”

Godby will host Niceville on Thursday, May 2 at 7 p.m. After playing several games on the new artificial turf at Cox Stadium this season, the Cougars are hoping they’ll be on their own campus grass at Jesse Forbes Field.

“I think that brings a whole different level of energy because we’ll have students there, we’ll have fans, we’ll be at home, we’ll be defending Godby High School,” Parmer said. “I think that helps us being at home instead of on the road. But if we get out, we’ll have to travel to Jacksonville to play the No. 3 team (Clay High) in the state.

611,5 Jacksonville police shootings in 2017 ruled justifiable,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The State Attorney’s Office has ruled three police shootings from 2017 justifiable, including a case in which three undercover police officers were arrested for tampering with evidence.

Jerome Allen, 22, was shot and killed Feb. 6, 2017, after he pointed a replica handgun at one of three detectives inside an undercover car during a drug deal, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

Detectives Brian Turner, Lance Griffis and Kyle Kvies were arrested a week later on evidence tampering charges because they ditched three beer cans that were in the car, including an open beer.

The charges against the detectives were later dropped as part a deal with prosecutors in which Turner, who shot Allen, resigned from the force and surrendered his law enforcement certificate.

Griffis and Kvies cooperated with the investigation, and avoided prosecution after completing community service hours.

Allen’s family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the three detectives, the Sheriff’s Office and Sheriff Mike Williams over his shooting.

In the second case, 57-year-old Selwyn Hall was shot and killed by Officer Ryan McGee outside his East 19th Street home April 26, 2017, while McGee was answering a domestic violence call.

Hall, who was accused of assaulting his wife, resisted arrested and was struck with a stun gun. According to police, McGee shot and killed Hall when Hall grabbed the stun gun.

In the third case, 44-year-old Daniel Blyler was shot and killed by Officer Lemmuel Johnson ​in the parking lot of Vic’s Sandwich Shop on North Edgewood Avenue on Aug. 25, 2017.

Investigators said Blyler was armed, inebriated, and refused to comply with Johnson's commands.

In the fourth case, 25-year-old Derrick Brabham was killed in a shootout on Aug. 18, 2017, with officers Kevin Jarrell and Mike Fox, both of whom were seriously wounded.

Police were sent to a home on Seaboard Avenue to investigate a domestic dispute, investigators said. Brabham had fired a shot and was threatening to kill his fiancee and himself.

In the fifth case, 20-year-old armed carjacking suspect Robert Bracewell was shot and killed by officers at the intersection of Lane and San Juan avenues. Investigators said Bracewell carjacked a 14-year old girl, then forced her out of the car. JSO had the car disabled by OnStar.

Officers B.L. Jester and B.J. Langston blocked the car, investigators said. Bracewell got out, gun in hand, and when he turned toward the officers, they fired a combined 17 shots, hitting Bracewell multiple times.

With the officers now cleared, JSO’s Response to Resistance Board is now looking into whether the shootings followed departmental guidelines for the use of deadly force.

613,"​​​​​​​'Well played': Speed trap foiled by anonymous plywood sign, Collier deputies say","All it took was some scrap wood and paint to foil Florida deputies trying to catch drivers speeding last week.

The Collier County Sheriff's Office shared on Facebook that deputies had set up a ""speed enforcement operation"" in Golden Gate Estates, east of Naples, in ""response to citizen requests.""

After waiting some time, deputies noticed something: No one was speeding.

""Traffic was steady, so why had they identified just one driver who was traveling over the speed limit?"" the office said.

Once the operation concluded, the officers noticed a sign less than a mile up the road from where they had tried to catch drivers.

""POLICE AHEAD,"" the sign said in bright, neon-orange letters.

""Well played, Anonymous Sign Artist,"" the office said online. ""Well played.""

The sheriff's office shared an image of the warning resting against a 45 mph speed limit sign.

Comments on the post questioned motivations of both deputies and drivers.

""So what you're telling us is that a homemade sign did more to deter speeding than several cops did?"" one commenter, Duane Vick, said.

623,Michigan teens save children from drowning in ocean rip current in Florida,"- They went down to Florida for fun in the sun.



It turns out they were in the right place at the right time - and became life-savers. Two local teens are heroes after saving two young children from drowning.

It was Serene Spring Break in Florida where best friends and juniors at Clarkston High School were soaking it all in when their trip took a turn.

""We were out in the ocean boogie boarding when we saw the kids floating by screaming,"" said Alex Byrd.

""We weren't really sure if they were playing around,"" said Tyler Brueck. ""So we looked more clearly and we kind of made out 'help me.'""

Two kids they didn't know, 6 and 8 years old, were caught in a rip current. it pulls you away from shore and challenges even the best swimmers.

""His head kind of went under the water a little bit,"" Alex said. ""And right then I just reacted and just pulled the kid up out of the water and I told him to go get the girl.""

There they were - one arm slung around each kid swimming hard to save them.

""I have no lifeguard training whatsoever,"" Alex said.

""Same here,"" Tyler said.

The teens knew to swim around the rip current not straight back to shore.

""I was just trying to use the waves to propel me forward and when I could stand, I just carried her out,"" Tyler said. ""She was traumatized she was breathing but wasn't saying anything.""

Amazingly both kids seemed to be okay, just scared and their parents stunned.

""The mom was in the shock,"" Alex said. ""And the dad was just disbelief.""

The teen's dads couldn't be any prouder of their boys.

""What's amazing is that they were there at the right moment and didn't hesitate,"" said John Brueck, Tyler's father.

""There was no doubt in my mind that if they hadn't been where they were, this story ends a completely different way,"" David Byrd, Alex's father said.

The lesson here, is don't ignore those beach warnings. It's how these young heroes knew how to react.

""I never would have thought I could do something like that that,"" Tyler said. ""It goes to show that anyone can do it. I saved a life. It's something literally I never thought would happen in my life.""

624,All the spraying makes for poor water quality in Florida: your say,"0403 Cartoon (Photo: Kevin Siers, The Charlotte Observer, NC)

Spraying overload

Spray, spray, spray.

They spray the air with chemicals for mosquitoes. They spray chemicals on lakes for weeds. They spray chemicals in canals for weeds. They spray chemicals under power lines for weeds. They spray chemicals along fence lines for weeds. They spray chemicals on road medians. The thousands and thousands of homeowners and landscapers spray chemicals on their lawns.

Here in Florida, everything ends up in the water, and now there is water quality problems. That is a surprise? Also don't forget the unlimited number of people moving here in their new home on land that was natural.

Guess what they are going to do? Spray, spray, spray.

Justice needed

As an animal lover in general and a dog lover in particular, I was appalled at the story and pictures of Duncan a dog that was used as bait by being hung by his rear legs so other dogs can bite his face while he is defenseless.

It is beyond my comprehension how a human being can do this to an animal that feels pain just like the lowlife person that did this.

I can only hope that whoever is responsible for this atrocity will be brought to justice.

Install lights

Recently an 8-year-old girl sitting in the dark waiting for her school bus was killed by a hit-and-run driver. Why haven't these dark bus stops not been lighted?

It would be a simple matter: install a pole with a solar light at the top. Had the little girl been more visible, the accident might still have happened – but then again, it might not have happened.

Thousands of dollars have been spent on studies to make our schools safer. If school schedules require our children to wait in the dark for their buses, installing lights seems to be a common sense way to make them safer.

Chuck Borton, Cape Coral

Civic duty

Is socialist a name for the Democratic Party or just an insult? The word comes from sociare (to share). It was created by Henri de Saint-Simon, a founder of ""Utopian Socialism"" in contrast to the ""Liberal Doctrine of Individualism"" – that people should act in isolation.

Communism is socialism plus totalitarianism. Christian socialism in the 19th century held that capitalism was rooted in greed. Pure socialism was neither popular nor successful. Popes spoke against it as they did against unrestrained capitalism. The U.S. does not want to be identified as socialistic but, like every other country, they are half socialistic and half capitalistic.

Republican Teddy Roosevelt had universal health care in his 1901 campaign. Later candidates followed. In 1935, FDR introduced Social Security to eliminate poverty for the retired elderly. In 1965, Lyndon Johnson established Medicare that provides for over 60 million people.

It is inaccurate to call Democrats socialists, despite any extremists. Governments must protect the rights of private ownership but they are also mandated to care for the sick and the poor that is not pure socialism but their civic duty.

625,"Edgewater woman, 97, recalls torture, abuse in Nazi concentration camps","Through a small square in the side of a boxcar cramped with human cargo, 22-year-old Elsie Ragusin watched the cities of Central Europe pass in and out of view.

The smell of human waste hung heavy in the thick heat. Hunger blurred her vision.

For five days in August 1944, the train traveled from northern Italy to Vienna, east to Budapest and up across Czechoslovakia and into Poland — no food, no water and no reprieve for its passengers.

Ragusin dared not budge from her place beside the sole source of fresh air and sunlight.

“If you moved, you’re afraid to be trampled,” Ragusin said. “I couldn’t squat down or anything.”

Ragusin was in shock.

What’s going on? Why am I being held?

“It was horrible. I couldn’t understand what was happening,” said Ragusin, now 97 and living in Edgewater. “I was stunned most of the time.”

Earlier that spring, German troops occupied Lussino, twin Italian isles off the Croatian coast where Ragusin was visiting her grandparents.

Nazi soldiers entered their home and demanded Ragusin and her father accompany them for questioning on suspicions of spying for the Allies.

She languished in jail cells for weeks, and then was put on a train bound, she thought, for factory work in Germany. That still seemed a possibility five days later when she stepped off the train in front of a hall with huge doors.

But several hours later when she entered a brick barracks lined with overcrowded bunks, she finally realized.

This was no factory.

Ragusin had arrived at Auschwitz, a sprawling death camp complex in Poland to which the Nazis deported more than 1.3 million people during Adolf Hitler’s regime.

Prisoners were shipped to Auschwitz from all over Europe. Most were Jews. Some were political dissidents. Others belonged to ethnic or social groups Hitler sought to eradicate.

But as far as Ragusin knew, she was the only American.

A sudden shift

From the deck of an Italian steamship, Ragusin (pronounced Ra-gu-ZEEN) gazed with eager eyes on majestic Mediterranean palaces and centuries-old monuments she’d only imagined in her native New York.

It was her third transatlantic voyage, but the first she was old enough to appreciate.

Soon after she was born on Nov. 4, 1921, her parents, Giovanni and Domenica Ragusin, took Elsie and her three older brothers to Lussino, their ancestral homeland, to meet the rest of the family.

But on this 1939 trip, 17 years old and fresh out of high school, Ragusin was mesmerized by every port they passed. Lisbon, Barcelona, Genoa, Corfu, Venice — each city enchanted her further.

Her fantasy continued when she arrived with her mother and father at her family’s seaside villa on Lussinpiccolo, the smaller of the Lussino islands. Their stay extended several years to care for her aging grandparents.

Ragusin explored castles, joined a theater group, assisted university students with English language compositions and fell for a striking 22-year-old navy captain named Toni Rocchi.

Neighbors called her the “most beautiful girl on the island” and numerous men sought her hand in marriage. But she had eyes only for Toni.

They danced on the moonlit shore, reveled at romantic military balls and took walks along the waterfront under their families’ watchful eyes.

“I had the love of my life in Europe,” Ragusin said. “He was a beautiful, kind man.”

He didn’t officially propose — the looming war cast a long shadow of uncertainty — but he asked her to wait for him. It was all the assurance she needed. “I knew I was his, you know, and that was it,” she said.

Toni was called to active duty on a warship in 1941, and the idyllic future she foresaw was snatched away.

Unjust imprisonment

At first, it seemed like a simple misunderstanding.

Soon after German forces occupied Lussino in spring 1944, two Nazi soldiers entered her grandparents’ home and accused Ragusin and her father of signaling Allied aircraft with cigarettes. Her mother and extended family were not implicated.

“I never smoked in my life,” Ragusin said. “(They said) we were spies, and that never happened. And then they were saying, too, that we were Jews, and that didn’t work out because we were Roman Catholic.”

Perhaps someone pointed the Nazis toward her and her father to spare their own life or curry favor with the occupying army. She still doesn’t know.

The soldiers ordered them to pack suitcases — they would be detained for a night or two until they could be interrogated.

But days stretched into weeks. They were shifted to other cities, other prisons. Ragusin’s father explained to authorities that it was all a big mistake. Instead of being freed, they were fingerprinted and separated.

Ragusin was moved to Trieste, in a northeastern nook of mainland Italy, and jailed with female political prisoners in a filthy, rat-infested cell. There, the seriousness of her situation set in.

Prisoners were selected for execution at random. Ragusin heard the screams of those who were tortured. The survivors returned with harrowing accounts of barbaric brutality.

She found hope in rumors that they might be sent by train to Germany. After so long in a prison cell, even the thought of forced labor seemed an escape.

At the station, she saw a familiar face among men being herded from one train to another.

“I saw my father and oh — that beautiful face,” Ragusin said. “I ran to him and he spotted me and ran to me and we embraced.”

A German soldier tore them apart, spat insults and shoved them into separate lines.

“He was put on one train, which went somewhere, I didn’t know where, and I was put in another,” she said. “And that was the last time I saw my father.”

‘Nothing but bones’

Five numbers tattooed on Ragusin’s forearm have faded with time, but her memory of the moment they were inked remains fresh.

Ragusin already was within the walls of Auschwitz when the train came to a stop at the end of her transcontinental trek from Trieste.

She hadn’t eaten, drunk, slept or sat down for five days.

The boxcar door slid open, and the bodies of those who perished on the journey tumbled out. The survivors waited on a platform for hours to enter a large hall that led into what she discovered later was a gas chamber.

Their suitcases were taken first, next their garments and then their dignity.

“I never took my clothes off in front of (anyone) — never,” Ragusin said. “And here I was naked in front of all these people. I think I died several times. I was so humiliated.”

She begged to keep her gold necklace with its cross pendant, her gold watch and a ring, a graduation gift from her parents. “You don’t need them here,” she recalled a guard’s cold reply.

They shaved her body and cropped her long, brown hair. She was sprayed with water — first scalding, then freezing — and doused with insecticide. The women lined up again, still naked, for officers to assess.

Women huddled together for warmth and were beaten for it. One fell to the floor in front of Ragusin, bleeding from a gash on her head.

“But you can’t pick them up,” she said. “You can’t do anything, you just have to stay there and look.”

A high-ranking Nazi officer she later learned was Adolf Eichmann, whom Hitler tasked with coordinating the Jews’ extermination, decided their fate with a flick of his finger.

“He'd mark you: Go this way or that way,” Ragusin said. “It meant those (sent to one side) are to go to work, and those (pointed to the other) will be killed.”

Those selected for labor had a number tattooed atop their left forearms. Ragusin no longer had a name. She was 82384.

She received one damp, smelly blue-and-gray dress, but no undergarments or shoes.

Prisoners slept in muddy barracks lined with rows of bunk beds. Seven to 10 people squeezed on their sides into each bunk with one blanket between them.

“When you open a can of sardines, they’re this way and that way — that’s how it was with people,” Ragusin said. “How could you ever sleep?”

She covered her face with her hands at night to protect it from being kicked.

They were roused daily at 2 or 3 a.m. for roll call. Many collapsed and died, too weak to stand at attention for hours in the rain or snow until the count was correct. The rest went to work.

A sign on the camp gate in German stated “Arbeit macht frei” — work sets you free — but Ragusin couldn’t read it.

She mixed cement, chopped wood and laid bricks to build more barracks. Her arms bled from carrying rocks and pushing heavy carts laden with sand and boulders. She sometimes worked all day and night with no rest.

“It was so atrocious, so hard to believe the things that were happening,” Ragusin said. “You never could imagine all the beatings and everything else.”

Guards struck her more than once as punishment for not working fast enough. One whipped her so hard across her left ear that she lost hearing.

She refused to show weakness.

“I was afraid that if they see that I’m hurting, they might shoot me,” she said, so she tucked her bloody face into her shoulder and kept going. “I never heard (out of that ear) again.”

Food was scant, and sanitation was nonexistent.

The latrine — if there was time to use it — was a row of holes in the ground, out in the open. Breakfast was a mug of ground beans.

“And then later, coming home (after work) for supper, we had a piece of black bread — very hard, which I broke my tooth on — a piece of margarine, a piece of some kind of bologna. But that was it,” Ragusin said.

Disease was rampant. Body lice spread typhus fever. Dysentery was common, and feces-contaminated drinking water induced typhoid.

“We were starving and thirsty because you knew if you drink the water, you’re gone,” Ragusin said.

She went barefoot for weeks until she bartered some bread for mismatched, holey shoes from a prisoner who worked unloading luggage from incoming transports. She stuffed scraps of paper and trash into the slits to keep the mud out.

Days and dates were meaningless. Her 23rd birthday passed, but she had no notion of it. Her withering body was the only means of measurement.

“I was a skeleton,” Ragusin said. “My face was sunk and my legs, my arms — just bones. Nothing but bones.”

She felt utterly alone. “I had no friends because you can’t trust anybody,” she said. “Who put you there? You don’t know. You can’t believe anybody.”

During the several months Ragusin estimates she spent at Auschwitz, she watched desperate prisoners grab the camp’s electric fence to kill themselves. Others tried to escape and were hanged. But she still held on to hope.

‘A lot to live for’

She’d always been strong-willed.

At age 2 or 3, Ragusin wandered away from her family’s Lussino home. Her panicked mother searched among the nearby shops until she found some men singing and drinking wine. One had Ragusin on his knee, singing along.

To forestall any further adventures, her mother took her sandals away, sure that Ragusin wouldn’t walk barefoot down the rocky path leading toward town. Her mother was wrong.

“Sure enough, I went there again without shoes,” Ragusin said. “I was a little rebel.”

Her innate perseverance kept her alive, but the waning days of the war tested her resilience more than ever.

As Allied forces approached Auschwitz in January 1945, she was shipped west by train to Ravensbrück, an all-female camp in northeast Germany.

It was as if the whole horrible nightmare was rewound and played again: a 400-mile journey in an overburdened boxcar during the heart of winter, the same humiliating intake process and selection. Only Ravensbrück was even worse than Auschwitz.

A colored cloth triangle on each woman’s uniform depicted why she was imprisoned. Jews wore a yellow triangle. Ragusin’s was red — designating her a political prisoner.

“I was so angry,” she said, still incensed at the injustice of it all. “I did nothing wrong.”

She traded a day’s supper for a needle and thread and sewed “USA” onto her red patch in defiance. Guards never confronted her about it.

She was quarantined for almost a month with hardly any food and infected sores spread over her body.

Once she was released into the general population, she worked in factories making parts for bombs, sawed down trees and dug holes in the forest. The prisoners on duty when the holes were deep enough were shot and shoved in.

People around her constantly died or disappeared, hauled away in trucks and never seen again.

A tooth once caused her such pain that she couldn’t work. Guards pulled it with pliers and no anesthesia. “I thought my whole insides were being taken out,” she said.

Even that was better than being taken to the medical ward, where “unthinkable” things happened.

Josef Mengele, a German physician who became known as the “angel of death,” subjected some prisoners to grotesque and inhumane procedures.

Ragusin underwent frequent “examinations,” she said. Women would be made to stand naked in front of large windows to be X-rayed and injected with unknown substances.

“You see the doctors standing there watching,” she said. “You have to parade in front of them. If you could, you could have just stabbed and killed them. Many times that’s how I felt. But you had to keep your sanity and keep on going, just be strong.”

Some experiments — cruel attempts at sterilization — were too graphic to describe in detail.

She remembers six doctors in white uniforms holding down her head, arms and feet, and then excruciating pain.

Her mind flashed to her fiance, Toni, and she mourned her lost innocence. She thought of her mother and father, her brothers back in New York and her Catholic faith.

“When they let me out that time, I said, ‘God, I want you to make a hole and put me right down there,’” Ragusin said. “I wanted him to bury me. I was so embarrassed, so ashamed. I didn’t want to live anymore for what they did.”

But she longed to see her family and Toni again. And so, as she had done so many days before, she summoned the courage to carry on.

“I kept on fighting all the time. Because I did want to live. I didn’t want to die then,” she said. “I thought, ‘I have a lot to live for.’”

The Swedish Red Cross arrived at Ravensbrück on April 24, 1945. And not a moment too soon. The Nazis had begun locking prisoners in and setting their barracks on fire. Ragusin heard hers was next.

She was taken to Sweden and later Denmark to recover and returned to the U.S. in late December 1945.

Her mother hid out in Italy until the war ended and came home to New York in 1947. Her father perished in Buchenwald concentration camp. Toni was killed in battle, and her youthful dreams died with him.

But 10 years later, she had a son. His father looked just like Toni.

‘God always saved me’

Ragusin has lived 1,170 months. She spent just 10 of them in Nazi jails and camps.

She has three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. She wrote a book. She loved and lost other men.

But she never recovered what those 10 months took from her.

She wasn’t a soldier, but she did go to war. She has no pension to show for it.

Ragusin resides alone in a retirement community, struggling to survive on her Social Security stipend. She relies on the Council on Aging of Volusia County to supply her with meals several times a week.

The same questions she grappled with at 22 have haunted her for 70 years.

“God always saved me in the camp,” Ragusin said. But why? Why was she there? Why is she here now?

She settles on two reasons. The first is her son, who lives with his wife a few doors down.

The other is her testimony.

Two years ago, a married couple asked Ragusin to meet their teenage daughter, who had fallen in with Nazi extremists and begun preaching their ideology in internet videos: The Holocaust was a hoax. Those sent to camps had plenty of food and spent their time relaxing in swimming pools.

Ragusin met with the girl and shared all she’d endured.

“Later, she called (me) and she said, ‘You saved my life,’” Ragusin said. “I think that’s why maybe I’m here.”

'Never forget'

The Holocaust survivors’ rallying cry has long been “never forget.”

As the youngest survivors age into their 70s, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., makes a special effort to preserve firsthand accounts in order to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike.

To honor this week's Days of Remembrance, established by Congress as the nation’s annual Holocaust commemoration, The News-Journal is sharing the individual accounts of four local Holocaust survivors.

Aimee Rubensteen, the museum's acquisitions coordinator, travels South Florida “rescuing the evidence of the Holocaust by speaking to firsthand witnesses,” she said, and collecting their World War II-era photos, letters, newspaper clippings, clothing and other artifacts of historical value — including the red triangle patch on which Elsie Ragusin sewed ""USA"" during her time in a German concentration camp.

“These original artifacts will be the things that teach the Holocaust to future generations,” Rubensteen said.

The museum’s mission is to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike and to encourage critical thinking about how and why those atrocities occurred.

Firsthand stories make those larger themes more personal.

“A lot of people don’t know about these specific, individual stories. The more we spread the word and expand the conversation, the better it is for everyone,” Rubensteen said.

Individuals or families who are interested in sharing their Holocaust artifacts or family keepsakes with the museum may contact Rubensteen at 786-496-2788 or arubensteen@ushmm.org to schedule an appointment.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190427/edgewater-woman-97-recalls-torture-abuse-in-nazi-concentration-camps?rssfeed=true,2019-04-27T19:37:47Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

629,"Martin County sees larger number of children using e-cigarettes than St. Lucie, Palm Beach counties","STUART — In Martin County, 23.3% of children between the ages of 11 and 17 use e-cigarettes.

That fact, mentioned in a youth substance abuse survey recently completed by the state, surprised a group gathered Wednesday morning at First United Methodist Church.

""If 23.3% of our youth in Martin County are using these substances, chances are we know a kid, we have a kid or are related to a kid that has these substances,"" said Kim Nash, the community health advocate for The QuitDoc Foundation, a non-profit organization that's part of Tobacco Free Florida.

""It's more common than we think. It's not something that you know only in a certain area or at a certain school. This is definitely affecting our entire community.""

About 45 people attended the event — the quarterly Community Conversations hosted by the United Way of Martin County.

Many in attendance were officials from organizations including the Martin County School Board, Children's Services Council of Martin County, Martin County Department of Health and the Boy's and Girl's Club of Martin County.

Nash spoke about the concerns her agency has with the increasing number of children in the county using these vaping devices.

""Our rates here in Martin County are higher than St. Lucie County, They're about on trend with Indian River County and they're higher than Okeechobee and Palm Beach counties,"" said Nash.

Anthony Calzadilla, assistant principal of Jensen Beach High School, said parents should be talking with their children about e-cigarette use before children enter high school.

""This is affecting every single youth in our county in a negative or an indirect way,"" he said. ""If we don't put an end to it, we're going to have very highly addicted kids.""

He said a nicotine patch — often used to help a person quit smoking by helping to reduce withdrawal symptoms — does not have enough nicotine to combat the nicotine that's in Juul.

Nash said e-cigarette products, such as Juul, have recently become popular with children because they're meant to go unnoticed.

""They don't omit an odor; they don't make a noise; they look like a flash drive. It's very hard for teachers to see that this is going on in a classroom,"" she said.

She said often when she talks to children about e-cigarettes, they believe they're just breathing in flavored water and don't realize they're also breathing in nicotine.

Nash said when someone breathes in one puff of a Juul pod, they get an entire cigarette's worth of nicotine in one breathe.

""So when you're introducing nicotine at such a young age, you're now changing the way that your brain is going to deal with addiction for the rest of your life, and that's terrifying,"" she said.

Joe Flanagan, the assistant principal for Anderson Middle School in Stuart said it's difficult for teachers to know when students have been using e-cigarettes because the products don't typically smell like cigarettes.

""It smells like bubble gum or it smells like fruit candy, which is the sneaky way that it's being done,"" he said. ""The first time I was doing a legal search looking for a Juul, I thought it was a flash drive.""

(Photo: LEAH VOSS/TCPALM)

Martin County Schools Superintendent Laurie Gaylord said one of the biggest concerns with children using e-cigarettes is that the long-term effects of the devices on children are unknown.

""You don't see a lot of middle school kids that are smoking cigarettes, but we have a lot of middle school kids vaping because, No. 1, their parents don't know it, and, No. 2, people don't realize the dangers of it,"" she said.

632,"Watch Rookery Bay doc on mangroves, 40-year history airing on Earth Day, April 22","Kayakers take a guided tour in Rookery Bay Reserve. Southwest Florida offers numerous kayaking opportunities. (Photo: Lance Shearer/Correspondent)

Southwest Florida's unique ecosystem, primarily its mangroves, is the main focus of a new documentary airing on Earth Day, April 22, at 9 p.m. on WGCU.

Florida filmmaker Elam Stoltzfus is behind the one-hour doc, ""Southwest Florida's Mangrove Coast,"" which looks not only at the tropical coastal vegetation, but also spotlights the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve and its 40-year history of protecting the fragile ecosystem between Marco Island and Naples.

Produced by Stoltzfus, an award-winning director, and written by Nic Stoltzfus, both with Live Oak Production Group, the documentary will air across Florida PBS stations all month-long.

""This documentary looks at the importance of the mangroves and its relation to hurricanes and then it looks at the history and how the reserve started as an idea from a few people in the 60s,"" Stoltzfus said.

Filmmaker Elam Stoltzfus's latest documentary ""Southwest Florida's Mangrove Coast"" focuses on Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve and its 40th anniversary. It will air on WGCU on Earth Day, April 22. (Photo: Submitted.)

That idea grew into partnerships with local families and conservation agencies, including the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The documentary features people who were instrumental in creating the reserve, and spotlights its past and present programs.

""To me, part of the strength of this story is that the partnerships established in the 60s are still there and have continued to grow and prosper,"" Stoltzfus said.

The documentary is also a celebration of the reserve's 40th anniversary this year.

“We are really excited about this film,” said the reserve's director Keith Laakkonen in a news release. “The documentary not only describes, but also shows the diversity of connections that people have made to this extraordinary place for over four decades.”

Located at the northern end of the Ten Thousand Islands on Florida's gulf coast, the reserve represents one of the few remaining undisturbed mangrove estuaries in the U.S.

Rookery Bay was designated as a National Estuarine Sanctuary by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Florida Gov. Bob Graham in 1978, following a grassroots effort spearheaded in the 60s by several groups, including the National Audubon Society, according to the news release.

This isn't Stoltzfus's first time documenting the region. He's worked with both the reserve and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection since the 90s. Originally from Lancaster, PA, Elam moved to Florida, got his degree in media production at Florida State University, and fell in love with the state, and most importantly, a girl.

“I love the outdoors and I love natural Florida. The stories I capture are about history and to learn about our natural habitats. My happy place is outdoors with a camera.” Florida filmmaker Elam Stoltzfus

For more than 30 years he has been documenting Florida's natural beauty, producing seven feature-length films, including ""Living Waters: Aquatic Preserves of Florida"" and ""The Great Florida Cattle Drive: Unbroken Circles. He's documented Rookery Bay several times in the past as well as the Big Cypress National Preserve.

""I love the outdoors and I love natural Florida. The stories I capture are about history and to learn about our natural habitats. My happy place is outdoors with a camera,"" Stoltzfus said.

634,Man accused of luring 7-year-old girl into men's bathroom,"A 26-year-old man was arrested earlier this week by Ocala police officers on a warrant of trying to encourage a 7-year-old girl to come into the men’s bathroom with him at a restaurant.

Anthony Hendry was taken into custody at 3495 W. Anthony Road for luring and enticing a child, attempt, on Wednesday. He was taken to the Marion County Jail. As of Saturday, Hendry was still at the jail on $1,000. His next court hearing is May 13th at 1 p.m.

On April 12, officers were called to a restaurant on North Pine Avenue for a suspicious call. When officers arrived, a woman told them she and her family went to the eatery to have dinner. She said a 7-year-old girl who was with her went to use the restroom by herself. When the child returned, the child said a man had opened the men’s restroom door and made a gesture for her to enter.

The woman went to the men’s restroom and was unable to open the door. The incident was reported to staff members who were unable to open the door. They yelled for the person to open the door and a man, later identified as Hendry, opened it. Hendry denied doing anything wrong and told employees he owned the business. He was told to leave and given a trespass warning.

Officers said Hendry made sexual comments to them and due to his behavior he was detained under Florida's Baker Act. In the meantime, officers continued with their investigation. They went to the State Attorney’s Office with their case and were able to obtain a warrant from a judge for Hendry’s arrest.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190420/man-accused-of-luring-7-year-old-girl-into-mens-bathroom?rssfeed=true,2019-04-20T16:27:54Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471
635,Jacksonville police investigating shooting of 2-year-old girl,"JACKSONVILLE — Jacksonville police say a 2-year-old girl is expected to recover after being shot and wounded Friday night at a Northside home.

The toddler, whose name wasn’t released, sustained a gunshot wound to the foot that is non-life-threatening, said Lt. Shawn Coarsey of the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

She is the second 2-year-old shot within two months in Jacksonville, according to Times-Union records.

Coarsey said three adults, twin 2-year-old girls and a 6-year-old boy were inside a home in the 100 block of East 44th Street when the shooting happened shortly before 9 p.m. Police were called about 9:10 p.m. when the mother of the injured girl took her to UF Health Jacksonville, he said.

“Thankfully, it’s non-life-threatening. Obviously, it’s a tragedy when a child gets shot,” Coarsey said. Detectives hadn’t determined whether one of the children accidentally fired the gun, he said.

Coarsey said the adults heard a gunshot and ran into a front bedroom where they found the girl wounded. About that time, the child’s parents arrived, scooped her up and took her to the hospital, he said.

He said it was too early in the investigation to say who fired the gun or owned it. Detectives were interviewing the people inside the home when the shooting happened, Coarsey said.

The victim’s mother and grandmother live at the home with an adult family friend. The friend and his girlfriend were at the house when the shooting happened, Coarsey said.

In a separate case, Jayden James Piedra died Feb. 11 after accidentally shooting himself inside a Jammes Road apartment on the Westside.

Police have said Jayden, his 7-year-old brother and their mother were visiting her boyfriend — who lived at the apartment — when the shooting happened.

The Sheriff’s Office subsequently arrested Jayden’s 29-year-old mother, Donna Anteonette Crump-Piedra, on two counts of child neglect and two more of culpable negligence involving a firearm. Her boyfriend, Lephabion Emaul Griggs, 25, was arrested on charges of culpable negligence/improperly stored gun and violation of probation.

The Sheriff’s Office said the loaded gun had been left out on a table as Crump-Piedra and Griggs slept on a couch. The brothers were playing with the weapon when Jayden shot himself, according to the Sheriff’s Office.

The Sheriff’s Office also said the gun previously had been reported stolen, and investigators are looking into how Griggs had possession of it.

Oliver was brought into the courtroom in a wheelchair Monday. He pleaded not guilty to burglary, assault and drug possession.

The judge increased Oliver's bond to $50,000 Monday. His next court appearance is scheduled for April 25.

(Photo: TIM SHORTT/ FLORIDA TODAY)

Everyone knows Washington D.C. is a mess. Sadly, the temperament in D.C. is being mimicked in Tallahassee and the Viera Government Center. The disrespectful tone and actions of elected officials toward each other and even constituents are appalling.

Tallahassee is no different as legislators lie to each other and the public about the impact of bills and then, through missives and social media posts, even go as low as to name call constituents that happen to disagree or point out flaws in legislation, as state Rep. Randy Fine has done.

In Viera, Commissioner Bryan Lober, in particular, is known for his vindictive actions from the dais and on social media. Aggressive rebuttals in commission meetings are common, and he has even made sure dissenting citizen posts are known to the person’s employer.

There is a level of decorum and professionalism missing in politics these days and it’s degrading to the institutions we elect to serve us. These officials need to grow up and be statesmen for a change.

Freedom of speech under attack

The Florida House, already a Second Amendment antagonist after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas School Safety Act, is 118-0 wrong on freedom of speech.

House Bill 741, which requires schools and universities to treat anti-Semitism the same way as racism when prohibiting discrimination, is clearly an infringement on freedom of speech.

And just like the school safety act, claims that the bills do not infringe on the United States Constitution or that of Florida are campaigning tactics to limit dissenting thought and trap legislators into bad votes. This bill would also endanger our colleges and lower the threshold for labeling students as racist for speaking opinions or even the truth.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said last week the role of a university is not to shield students from speech that would make them uncomfortable. The governor is right. And the role of the Legislature is to protect those freedoms and ensure they are not infringed.

Let’s hope the governor remembers that with a veto pen when he gets HB 741 on his desk.

Justified jewel kick?

A transgender student in Alaska went into a school boys’ restroom and took a selfie that was posted to social media. The boys in the school were a bit miffed by this and decided they would return the favor, so seven of them marched to a girls’ restroom to accomplish the task.

As the seven arrived and began to enter, a female student was exiting the facility, but was blocked from leaving by the first boy coming in. Imagine being a girl and your perception is that seven boys are trapping you in the girls’ room.

How would you react?

You got it, she kicked him in the groin and the remaining boys scattered as if Batman had just arrived and thwarted their evil plans. All were disciplined, but the girl was suspended indefinitely for the violence. Whoa! She was being blocked from leaving in what could have been an attack.

This school needs to reevaluate what happened and look at the girl’s perspective.

663,"'Help me!' Michigan teens hear cries, rescue kids on spring break trip","MELBOURNE, Fla. - Tyler Brueck and Alex Byrd heard the noise, but they didn’t know exactly what it was right away.

Brueck and Byrd were boogie boarding on Melbourne Beach in Florida on April 7, thinking at the time it was just going to be a normal, relaxing day while on spring break with their lacrosse team from Clarkston High School in Michigan.

It turned out to be anything but normal from the moment they heard the noise.

“We noticed these two kids five to 10 (yards) out to the right of us and we were maybe 50 yards from the shore,” Brueck said. “We heard screaming. We weren’t sure if they were just messing around or what’s happening. After paying closer attention, we hear ‘Help me.’ It was a boy and a girl.”

The kids were caught in a rip current and in need of rescuing, and Brueck and Byrd probably felt they weren't so qualified for the task, considering neither had never had any previous lifeguard training.

But instinct took over and Brueck and Byrd swam toward the children.

Byrd grabbed the boy, while Brueck put the girl in his arm, as both teens initially struggled with the rip current themselves.

“I had her around my one arm and I was trying to swim with the other,” Brueck said. “I knew to swim horizontally, so that’s what I was doing. I was trying to use the waves to propel me forward. It was working and I got to calmer waters and carried her out to shore.”

Once everyone was on shore, came the expected tearful and happy reunion, as the parents of the kids ran up to Brueck and Byrd to offer their appreciation.

“The mom was crying and hugged me and thanked me,” Brueck said. “The dad was in disbelief. He shook my hand and thanked me as well.”

Brueck estimates the age of the boy was 8 and the age of the girl was 6, but they never officially found out because the family left the beach a short time later.

They don’t know where the family was from or if they were on a spring break trip, as well.

“They were probably traumatized,” Brueck said.

Whoever that family is, they’ll likely never forget Brueck and Byrd, who in turn will never forget that day that started off so leisurely.

“We just thought it would be a normal spring break day,” Brueck said.

Avery said she was down by the water when she saw something in the sand and that when she pulled it out, everyone started screaming.

""We're all kind of like jumping up and down and screaming really loud. And my dad didn't believe us at first and I was Facetiming people and they said that we bought it,” Avery said.

“And so they kind of didn't believe us. But then whenever I came back and showed them, they've said it was really cool.""

666,"2nd victim comes forward after officer accused of sex with child, records show","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A veteran Jacksonville police officer accused of raping a child is facing more charges after a second victim came forward, according to Duval County court records.

Officer Matthew Butler, 39, was arrested last month after the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office got a tip he was in possession of an inappropriate photo of a young girl on a digital device.

The nine-year veteran officer was initially charged with capital sexual battery on a child under 12.

Another child has since come forward with allegations of sexual abuse, according to court records. The girl told police Butler performed a sex act on her during a sleepover.

Butler is now facing three counts of sexual battery, a child porn possession charge and a charge of lewd & lascivious molestation.

He is being held on $1.5 million bond.

Police did not indicate Butler’s relationship to the first victim but said they were checking all of Butler’s electronic devices to see if there could be any more victims.

Undersheriff Pat Ivey said the JSO was taking the unusual step of releasing an employee's booking photo due to the nature of the crime. Ivey said the officer resigned prior to his arrest.

669,Parental consent for abortions clears another hurdle in Florida House,"The state capitol was a battleground for abortion restrictions Wednesday.

The GOP majority is cueing up a legal challenge over whether minors can be required to get their parents consent for an abortion.

A pro-life rally outside the capitol and the bill coming up for a committee hearing inside, requiring a young woman to have her parents consent for an abortion, was on the agenda all throughout the capitol grounds.

“I am tired of the lie that abortion is health care,” said Rep. Tommy Gregory.

“God is the person…that allows people to be pregnant. We have to trust that he knows best,” said Rep. Bob Rommel.

“At 12-years-old, if you are able to get pregnant, you can, in fact, walk into an abortion clinic and obtain an abortion,” said Rep. Erin Grall.

A handful of the more than 50 who signed up to speak at the committee were either abuse or rape victims.

“Had I become pregnant when I was sexually abused, I could not have gone to my parents,” said Carolyn Siegelman with the National Latino Institute for Reproductive Health.

The legislation does allow a young woman who can’t go to her parents for consent to seek a judicial bypass, but one woman told lawmakers it was cumbersome.

“As a teenage girl can not tell her parents she is pregnant, like I was, there’s a good reason. Trust her to make the right decision,” said Kristen Erichsen.

With new appointments from a new governor, Florida’s Supreme Court has switched from a four-three liberal majority, to a six-one conservative majority.

If the legislation is approved, the GOP-led legislature believes it will set up a challenge to a 1989 court ruling that found the privacy amendment applies to underage minors.

“My intent is to have the parental consent added back to our statutes…added to our statutes so that parents are involved in the decision,” said Grall.

Under the legislation, a physician that performs an abortion without a parent's consent could be guilty of a felony.

680,WENDY VICTORA: Have a brightly colored Easter Sunday,"Growing up as a Catholic girl in a small Illinois town, Easter Sunday meant three things.

We went to church. We dyed hard-boiled eggs, which our parents then hid and we tried to find before they started to smell. And I got to buy a new dress, one that I chose myself.

That alone was the most uncommon of occurrences. My parents were frugal people, and between boxes of hand-me-downs and school uniforms there were few occasions to go shopping for a new dress.

As a result, this annual shopping trip was like giving me a palate slathered with a paint and a canvas as big as the sky.

I went crazy.

My mom is gone so I never got to ask her what she thought of my selections each year. Maybe she didn't flinch. Looking back at our family portraits, her dresses were a bit on the loud side, too.

But as a child I never questioned my taste. This was the era of polyester leisure suits for boys and gaudy polyester dresses for girls.

Did I mention we also, for most of my childhood, wore bonnets on Easter Sunday?

One year in particular stands out. We went to the department store in the closest city to our rural home, where I ferreted out a mustard brown dress covered with polka dots the size of ping-pong balls. Around the neck was a huge droopy bow made of the same fabric.

That was one of my more boyish looking years, which added to the oddity of my overall appearance.

But it was glorious in my eyes. Cause for celebration.

Christ had risen from the dead and I had a new dress.

Childhood memories color our adult years, and Easter continues to be a brightly hued day in my life.

I don't buy a new dress or boil eggs, and I haven't worn a bonnet in 40-plus years.

But it's still Easter Sunday.

The sun comes up and mostly shines. Flowers still bloom in random places. The world's not perfect, but there's plenty of beauty to go around.

May you find something to celebrate today, whether it's the resurrection of Christ, the joy on a child's face, jelly beans that actually taste good or the first bite of a chocolate rabbit.

682,Third grade student accused of punching Volusia elementary school teacher,"VOLUSIA COUNTY, Fla. - A 10-year-old Volusia County elementary student is accused of punching her third grade teacher, according to the Volusia County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies responded to Woodward Elementary School on Wednesday for a battery complaint.

The teacher told deputies the student threw her textbook on the ground in the classroom. When asked to pick it up, she punched the teacher's hand, according to an incident report with the Sheriff's Office.

According to the teacher, the incident was not the first time the 10-year-old had become physical with school staff.

The teacher told deputies she wants to press charges against the girl.

A spokesperson for the Volusia County School District said the incident is being handled by law enforcement.

“We are aware of the allegations. School administration is looking into the situation,"" a spokesperson for the Volusia County School District said. ""Any other questions will have to be directed to the police department.”

683,Charge downgraded for teen who got head slammed into ground by deputy,"BROWARD COUNTY, Fla. - A 15-year-old boy who was arrested Thursday after he was pepper sprayed and his head was slammed into the ground by Broward Sheriff's Office deputies appeared in court Friday, where one of the charges against him was downgraded.

The teen was originally arrested on charges of aggravated assault against a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest without violence and trespassing.

The teen's attorney argued in court that there was no probable cause for the aggravated assault charge, and the judge agreed to downgrade to a simple assault charge.

The judge, however, said there was a struggle during the incident outside a McDonald's in Tamarac and the teen tried to get his arm free, hence the resisting arrest charge.

The teen, who has no prior history with the criminal justice system, was released after the hearing to his mother.

The incident between the teen and deputy was captured on cellphone video by a group of teens who told Local 10 News they had gathered at the McDonald's after school to watch two teens fight.

Cellphone video shows one deputy who responded to the scene restraining a teenager in the parking lot when another deputy pushes away a girl who appeared to grab a phone from the ground.

The same deputy then uses pepper spray on the teen who appeared in court Friday after the teen appears to intervene. After pepper spraying the teen, the deputy is seen grabbing him and taking him to the ground.

Two other deputies then jump in, one of them banging the teen's face on the pavement and punching his head.

The teen and another teen were ultimately arrested.

A man who witnessed the incident told Local 10 News he believed the deputies went ""way too far.""

The Broward Sheriff's Office has not released the identities of the deputies involved in the incident and it's unclear whether they will be reprimanded.

684,"Escambia, Santa Rosa unscathed after overnight storms. What's in store for the weekend?","Escambia and Santa Rosa counties came out relatively unscathed from Thursday night's severe weather forecast, despite a storm that caused multiple downed trees, hail damage and even possible tornadoes to the east and west of the Pensacola area.

Brandon Black, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mobile, Alabama, said Thursday night's storm didn't have nearly as much energy as forecasters expected it might.

""We had some stronger straight-line winds over here in Mobile, but it really didn't pack quite as much of a punch as it came through,"" Black said. ""The second round didn't get quite as organized as we were anticipating, and it never got going as well as forecast.""

Monster storm: Hurricane Michael upgraded to Category 5 — only fourth on record

Black said the storm came through earlier than meteorologists had predicted it would, so conditions weren't as favorable for severe weather.

There were no reports of storm damage in Escambia or Santa Rosa Counties as of 11 a.m. Friday.

Areas to the east and west weren't quite as lucky. Tornadoes were reported across Texas, Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi as the system moved from west to east. In Tallahassee, an 8-year-old girl was killed when a tree fell on her family's home during the storm Friday morning.

Weekend weather forecast

Friday's weather is forecast to be cloudy and mild, with a slight chance of light rain in some areas.

The dreariness led the Blue Angels to cancel practice for the day, the team posted on social media. The elite fighter jet demonstration team requires a minimum visibility of three nautical miles and a minimum ceiling of 1,000 feet to fly.

The skies are expected to clear up starting Saturday, with highs in the mid to upper 70s on Saturday and Sunday, climbing back into the 80s by Monday.

685,California couple who shackled children could get life in prison,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. AP photo

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The desperate cry for help came from a girl who had lived in such isolation for 17 years that she didn’t know her address, the month of the year or what the word medication meant.

But after jumping out a window from the filthy home where she lived with her parents and 12 siblings, she knew enough to punch the digits 9-1-1 into a barely workable cellphone and then began describing years of horrific abuse to a police dispatcher.

The brave girl’s call that freed her siblings — some who had been chained to their beds — led to the opposite fate for their parents, David and Louise Turpin, who face 25 years to life in prison when sentenced Friday.

Investigators found that the toddler had not been abused, but all of the children were hospitalized after they were discovered.

The seven adult children were living together and attending school in February when their parents pleaded guilty. Attorney Jack Osborn, who represents them, declined to comment on them Thursday.

It’s not clear if any children will attend the sentencing, but they will be offered a chance to speak or can offer written statements to be read in court.

Defense attorneys would not say if their clients will address the court.

The couple pleaded guilty to 14 criminal charges. Prosecutors said the deal would likely keep them in prison for the rest of their lives and spare the children from testifying.

“The defendants ruined lives, so I think it’s just and fair that the sentence be equivalent to first-degree murder,” District Attorney Mike Hestrin said at the time of the plea.",http://www.wfla.com/national/california-couple-who-shackled-children-could-get-life-in-prison/1938353459,2019-04-19T10:54:14Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
687,Girl Scouts staffer fired after past allegations arise,"Jordan Richmond, a former Marion County public school teacher, had been poised to take on running Alachua County's Camp McConnell.

An experienced camp instructor, who was set to run a 212-acre children’s camp up until it was discovered he'd been fired over concerns about his relationship with a former 16-year-old student, has been fired from his job with the Girl Scouts of Gateway Council.

Monday, The Sun reported that Jordan A. Richmond, a former Marion County school teacher, lost his post as an educator in 2016 after an investigation revealed concerns from other teachers and students about his close relationship with an underage female student.

Earlier this month, Richmond was named the Girl Scouts' chief girl experience and outdoor programming officer.

Richmond was fired by the Jacksonville-based organization Wednesday after officials there became aware of the past accusations. His name was removed Thursday from the website and staff directory.

“First and foremost, my primary responsibility is the safety and protection of girls,” said Mary Anne Jacobs, the organization’s chief executive officer. “We will do whatever it takes to make sure a girl is safe.”

The Girl Scouts of Gateway Council serves more than 10,000 girls in grades k-12 across the North Central Florida region. Some of those counties include Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Clay, Levy, Duval, Gilchrist and Suwannee counties. The organization was among the groups that vouched for Richmond in his bid to run Alachua County’s Camp McConnell.

Girl Scouts spokeswoman Triciarae Stancato said that the organization has an extensive background-vetting process.

The background checks are similar to those done by school districts, Jacobs added, and Richmond passed his. Jacobs said his role didn't allow him direct access to girls camping, but provided strategic approaches as part of the executive leadership team.

On April 5, the organization announced Richmond’s hire on its website and said he would “ensure that Gateway Council recognizes Girl Scouts’ long, storied, and successful history of getting girls outdoors.”

Richmond, who previously served as the YMCA Camp McConnell director in Alachua County, has denied having an inappropriate relationship with a former Marion County student.

The student, who was a high school junior at the time, eventually dropped out of school, moved out of state and now does adult films.

A 2016 investigation by Marion County Public Schools resulted in a reprimand for misconduct, which caused him to lose his West Port High School teaching job. Some students interviewed during the investigation said the girl would wear Richmond’s wedding band, that the two were often alone late after school, that they texted each other during and after class and would go into his office and shut the door while other students where in the classroom.

School officials asked Richmond to correct his behavior but said it escalated when the two were spotted by Ocala police in a vehicle behind an abandoned car dealership on a Sunday evening.

Investigators concluded Richmond used poor judgment, showed partiality and lost the confidence of his students, but did not confirm any romantic contact. He was reprimanded for misconduct. He was never arrested or criminally charged in connection with the incident or investigation.

Richmond said Monday that he was never told why he wasn’t rehired and that he was reprimanded for writing too many hall passes. Records, however, show the reprimand and decision not to renew his teaching contract were directly related to the investigation. He was also later reprimanded by the state’s Department of Education for failing to note when he applied for a teaching job in Lake County that he'd been investigated for misconduct.

Earlier this week, Richmond was poised to lease Alachua County's 212-acre Camp McConnell, where his nonprofit Basecamp Ventures would provide free and low-cost camping and swimming services to children in the region.

A day after The Sun’s article, county officials halted that process and said they would further investigate the accusations, while looking at other options for the property.

“The County Commission recently was made aware of these issues,” spokesman Mark Sexton said. “Their immediate action was to cancel negotiation to lease the property to Basecamp Ventures.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190418/girl-scouts-staffer-fired-after-past-allegations-arise?rssfeed=true,2019-04-18T11:00:44Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608

689,Report: School expels girl for kicking boy who entered the girls' bathroom,"- A female student has been expelled from school after kicking a boy in the groin who she says came in the girls' bathroom and blocked the door.

According to the Anchorage Daily News, a group of seven teenage boys entered the girls' bathroom at North Pole High School in Alaska in protest because a transgender student, who identifies as a boy, took a selfie in the boys' bathroom.

""On April 4, a group of male students began to enter the restroom. Only one male student actually proceeded past the door frame,"" said the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District in a statement. ""The other male students followed behind him and were not yet in the restroom. A female student (not the transgender student) was exiting the restroom at the time the first male student began to enter. The female student kicked the first male student in the groin. The male students turned around and left the area.""

The family of the girl said that she was expelled ""indefinitely."" The incident caught the attention of Rep. Tammie Wilson, who is questioning the decision by the school district.

“She is somehow being blamed for this situation when she was the only one where she should’ve been,” said Rep. Tammie Wilson, R-North Pole, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “If you feel threatened, you should be able to defend yourself.”

The school district says all eight student involved in the incident have been disciplined.

690,"9-year-old girl dead, 8 others injured in hit-and-run crash on Alligator Alley","The Florida Highway Patrol says at least one person is dead after a hit-and-run crash on Alligator Alley.

BROWARD COUNTY, Fla. - A 9-year-old girl was killed and eight other people were injured in a hit-and-run crash that shut down all lanes of traffic early Wednesday on Alligator Alley.

Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Alvaro Feola said the crash occurred about 3:30 a.m. in the northbound lanes of Interstate 75, near mile marker 43.

Feola said two vehicles believed to be speeding collided. He said the impact pushed one of the vehicles into a Chevrolet Blazer, which overturned several times and came to a rest in the southbound lanes.

The 9-year-old girl, who was a passenger in the SUV, was flown to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, where she was pronounced dead.

Feola said the drivers of the vehicles that collided fled on foot and were later apprehended by Broward Sheriff's Office deputies. They were also hospitalized.

Four others were taken to Broward Health Medical Center, while the others were taken to Cleveland Clinic in Weston.

Feola said the SUV was traveling from Fort Lauderdale to Bradenton at the time of the crash.

According to the FHP, northbound traffic on the stretch of Interstate 75 will be closed for at least four hours between U.S. Highway 27 and the Broward County-Collier County border.

A view from Sky 10 showed Florida Highway Patrol troopers blocking the northbound toll plaza on the stretch of Interstate 75 known as Alligator Alley.

Southbound lanes were closed at one point, but they reopened about 6:30 a.m.

Northbound traffic was being diverted after a fatal hit-and-run crash on the stretch of Interstate 75 known as Alligator Alley.

Northbound traffic was being diverted off the interstate during the crash investigation.

691,Dunnellon man arrested on suspicion of sex with girl,"William T. Watson Jr. was taken into custody Monday morning on charges of lewd and lascivious battery and child abuse by impregnation.

A Dunnellon man was arrested on suspicion of having sex with an underage girl and having a baby with the child.

William T. Watson Jr. was taken into custody Monday morning on charges of lewd and lascivious battery and child abuse by impregnation. He was released Monday night on $7,000 bond.

According to the 27-year-old's arrest report, on Dec. 3, 2018, sheriff’s deputies learned that a 16-year-old girl had recently given birth and that she was pregnant at age 15.

Inspector Erik Dice was assigned the case and was told Watson had sex with the girl and probably was the child’s father. Dice received DNA samples from the child and the baby’s mother.

Dice met with Watson at the Sheriff’s Office on Dec. 14 and he admitted to having sex with the teen. He believed the child belonged to him. Dice got a DNA from him as well.

The inspector got DNA results from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement earlier this month which showed Watson is the child’s father.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190417/dunnellon-man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-sex-with-girl?rssfeed=true,2019-04-17T11:09:51Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471

696,"Sunrise man paid underage girls for sex, recorded them, deputies say","Deputies said they found dozen of videos in his home that show Neil Greenberg having sex with underage girls.

SUNRISE, Fla. - A Sunrise man was arrested Monday after deputies said he had sex with underage girls -- some as young as 14 years old -- for years and recorded the encounters. Deputies also said he operated a website that connected men with prostitutes.

Neil Greenberg, 60, faces charges of possession of child pornography and promoting sexual performance by a child.

According to the arrest report, authorities recieved information in January that a 17-year-old girl who had been reported missing had been communicating with Neil Greenberg via Facebook Messenger. The transcripts of their conversations showed that Greenberg had been paying the girl for sex, the report said.

""I really need to make money,"" the girl wrote to Greenberg.

In one of the chats, the girl expresses concern that Greenberg had unprotected sex with her sister. In another, the girl asks Greenberg to pay her cellphone bill.

""When you get a chance please send me a full length selfie. Thank you,"" Greenberg wrote, ending one conversation.

The report said Broward County sheriff's deputies confirmed Greenberg operated the Facebook account and searched his home in the 2300 block of Northwest 139th Avenue. During the search, deputies found a memory card inside a locked safe in his bedroom closet, the report said. Deputies said the card was hidden under a felt lining at the bottom of the safe.

Files on the card were named ""For Evidentiary Purposes"" and ""Read_this,"" the report said.

On the card, deputies found 28 videos recorded in 2017 that show Greenberg having sex with a 16-year-old girl. In another folder, deputies found eight videos recorded in 2012 that show Greenberg having sex with an underage girl, the report said.

The card also contained a text file written by Greenberg in 2013 that attempted to explain the videos, the report said.

""These video are kept here for the sole purpose that they may contain evidentiary value for me because of dialogue contained may prove useful. Since learning of (redacted)'s true age. I decided it would be better if I did not delete them but instead put them offline where I could get them if it ever became necessary,"" Greenberg wrote, according to the report.

Greenberg wrote that he never ""knowingly"" had sex with an underage girl.

""It is not something I am interested in and never have been,"" Greenberg wrote. ""I have long maintained that I enjoy the company of young ladies, but 18 year old or older is just fine with me. They do not need to be any younger than that. I would gladly take a polygraph if necessary.""

Deputies also connected Greenberg to a website where paying members could access forums where they could set up ""sessions"" or ""dates"" with ""independent escorts."" The report said Greenberg screened users to ensure they were not law enforcement officers.

On Tuesday, Greenberg was being held more than $1 million bond at Broward County's Main Jail in Fort Lauderdale.

Deputies believe there may be additional victims. Anyone with additional information about Greenberg is asked to contact Detective Michael Joo at 954-88-5327 or Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS.

697,"Clerk stabbed while trying to rape teen in gas station bathroom, deputies say","Mohammad Munshi is accused of trying to rape a 17-year-old girl in the bathroom of a Chevron gas station where he worked.

DANIA BEACH, Fla. - A clerk at a Dania Beach gas station was arrested after he tried to rape a teenage girl at knifepoint in the bathroom before she stabbed him and was able to get away, deputies said.

Mohammad Munshi, 67, of Hollywood, was arrested last week on a charge of armed sexual assault on a victim 12 or older.

According to a Broward Sheriff's Office probable cause affidavit, the 17-year-old girl went to the Chevron gas station on Stirling Road to buy two microwave dinners shortly before 3 a.m. April 7.

After buying the meals, she asked Munshi, who was a clerk at the store, if she could use the bathroom.

While the girl was in the bathroom, Munshi locked the front door to prevent any customers from entering and then went into the bathroom with his belt unbuckled and the zipper of his pants open, Deputy Louis Bonhomme alleged in his affidavit.

Once in the bathroom, Munshi grabbed the girl, put his hands in her pants and grabbed her buttocks, the affidavit said.

After the girl pushed Munshi away from her, he pulled out a pocketknife, but she fought with him and, during the struggle, stabbed him in his belly, Bonhomme alleged.

The girl ran out of the store but didn't contact authorities because of her immigration status, the affidavit said.

Meanwhile, Munshi returned to his post at work and didn't get help until about 20 minutes later, when he asked a customer to call deputies, the affidavit said.

Munshi was taken to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, where he was treated for his stab wound. While at the hospital, Munshi claimed he was stabbed while trying to stop a shoplifter.

""However, upon reviewing the surveillance footage of the incident, it was observed that the victim did not shoplift,"" Bonhomme wrote.

Munshi's story was ""inconsistent"" and didn't match the video evidence, Bonhomme added.

""There is cause for concern for the community,"" Broward County Judge Jackie Powell said during Munshi's court appearance Monday morning.

Powell set Munshi's bond at $75,000. As a condition for his release, Munshi must also be fitted with a GPS monitor, can't have any contact with the girl and must surrender his passport.

698,"Florida man hacked teens' Snapchat accounts, stole their lewd photos, officials say","- A Florida man was arrested for hacking into teenagers’ Snapchat accounts and threatening to send out lewd images he found of them, deputies said.

Detectives in Collier County arrested 21-year-old Jorge Ingunza, Jr. for extortion, and transmitting and possessing child pornography. Six of the teen victims live in Collier County and two live in Colorado. All range in ages from 13 to 18.

Through their investigation, officials said Ingunza would hack into their accounts and change their back-up email, phone numbers and passwords. Then, he would download lewd images the victims had of themselves from those accounts, contact the victim on Instagram and send them their own images.

Investigators said Ingunza would threaten to post those images publicly on social media if the victims didn’t send him additional lewd images. The suspect used fake social media accounts to make contact with the teenagers on Instagram. Officials said he also used compromised accounts that he hacked from other victims.

Detectives determined the activity came from Ingunza’s home at 10268 Emperor Lane in Naples. On Wednesday, Collier County detectives and SWAT team members with the sheriff’s office served a search warrant at the home. Inside, they found Ingunza with his mother, according to the agency. They said they also found evidence linking Ingunza to the extortion and lewd images, but officials did not provide details on the evidence.

The Collier County Sheriff’s Office said they receipved multiple reports in December from the local victims, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and officials from Colorado regarding Ingunza’s activity.

Detectives said there is evidence of more unidentified victims.

“Some of whom may not want to come forward because they fear they will be in trouble with law enforcement and their parents for having lewd photos of themselves,” the agency wrote in a Facebook page. “Detectives said the victims will not face charges and that law enforcement is focused on helping them.”

Anyone who believes they could be a victim or has additional information on the case is asked to call Collier County Sheriff’s Office at 239-252-9300. Anonymous tips can be submitted to Crime Stoppers by calling at 1-800-780-8477.

Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk offered the following safety tips for children and parents when it comes to social media use:

- Use parental monitoring software. Both free and paid parental monitoring apps are available with a wide variety of features. These apps can do everything from monitor the content of your child’s texts to sending alerts when your child adds a new contact.

- Check your child’s electronic devices often.

- Always know what apps your child is using and how the app can be used to communicate with others. Any app or website that allows your child to communicate and interact with unknown people is not safe.

- Never give out identifying or personal information – home address, school name, telephone number, age, marital status, or financial information in chat rooms or bulletin boards.

- Keep the computer in a family room rather than the child’s bedroom.

- Share an email account with your child to oversee their mail, and consider joining your children when they are in private chat areas.

- Don’t post photographs of your children on Web sites that are available to the public.

- Most social media apps have an age requirement. Enforce it.

- Learn their dialect. Kids have a language of their own when it comes to communicating online. Make sure you know what they are talking about.

- Guard your location. Kids may have fun tagging posts or photos with a location taken from a mobile device’s GPS, but parents might not want their child’s precise whereabouts broadcast.

- Inquire about your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) privacy policies and exercise your options for how your personal information may be used.

- Never allow your child to arrange a face-to-face meeting with someone they’ve “met” online unless they’ve received your permission.

- If you become aware of the transmission, viewing, or use of child pornography while online, immediately report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s CyberTipline at 1-800-843-5678 or www.cybertipline.com.

- Instruct your child not to click on any links that are contained in email from persons they don’t know. Such links could lead to inappropriate websites.

- Remember that people online may not be who they seem. Someone indicating that “she” is a “12-year-old girl” could really be a 40-year-old male predator.

-Be careful about offers that involve personally coming to a meeting, having someone visit your house, or sending money or credit card information",http://www.fox13news.com/news/florida-news/florida-man-hacked-teens-snapchat-accounts-stole-their-lewd-photos-officials-say,2019-04-05T10:43:02Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609

A Central Florida elementary school teacher wants to press charges against one of her students.She claims that the 9-year-old girl hit her, and the incident happened in the classroom. That teacher has now filed a report with the sheriff's department. The alleged victim is a third grade teacher at Woodward Avenue Elementary School in DeLand. She said the student hit her when the teacher told her to pick up a book that the student allegedly threw.""There are no other professions that exist where it would be okay or acceptable to be hit by anyone,"" said Volusia United Educators president Elizabeth Albert.Albert said she was disappointed, but not surprised that a student allegedly hit a teacher. She said it's not the norm, but it's not rare, either, and according to the sheriff's report, ""this was not the first time that she (the student) had become physical with the staff.""Albert said more and more often, teachers trained to deliver academic content are being asked to deal with social and emotional needs. ""What we really need more of are the licensed, mental health specialists, professionals who can help the children and give them the support they really need,"" Albert said.Officials said the teacher, in her first year with Volusia County schools, asked the student to pick up a text book the 9-year-old threw on the classroom floor. According to the report, the student, ""refused and punched her (the teacher) in the right hand.""The teacher didn't need medical attention, but feels so strongly she's pressing charges.""We should have folks looking at our kids who are in crisis and determining what interventions are going to make them successful,"" Albert said.In a statement, a district spokesman wrote, ""We are aware of the allegations. School administration is looking into the situation.""The school district won't comment on what, if any, discipline the student faces based on the allegation. The union president said per the contract, a student who acts out against a teacher is at the very least suspended.According to the teacher's union, there have been several instances this year alone in which teachers or staff members had to go to the hospital or urgent care for an injury allegedly made by a student, but that was not the case with this incident. The teacher did not need medical attention.",https://www.wesh.com/article/9-year-old-student-accused-of-punching-teacher-in-deland/27211013,2019-04-19T21:05:00Z,WESH-TV,Couple,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789

712,"Pensacola FemFest is back: Self Love Sunday, Womanhood in Lavender headline schedule","FemFest returns to Pensacola next week to celebrate intersectional feminism with an extended weekend of events.

The third annual FemFest runs from Thursday, April 25, through Sunday, April 28.

FemFest founder and organizer Kirstin Norris said the work done by the collective of feminist organizations in Pensacola to advance equality and educate the community can be serious, taxing work for those involved. So FemFest is about taking a deep breath and celebrating with those who have furthered the movement, while also raising funds to help organizations that are doing the same.

""We spend a lot of time doing things like the women's march and involving ourselves in these causes but it can take a toll on us emotionally, it's a lot of work, it's a lot of commitment,"" Norris said. ""And FemFest is there to serve as an opportunity to celebrate. To take a lighthearted, fun week to celebrate the things we believe in and to celebrate each other.""

What are the FemFest events in 2019?

Trans Art Expo, April 25: An art exhibition at Artel Art Gallery featuring pieces by local transgender artists kicks off the four-day event. There's no cost to get into the Expo, but wine will be available for suggested donation. It runs from 6-9 p.m. Address: 223 Palafox Place, Pensacola.

Womanhood in Lavender, April 26: FemFest’s most popular event, held at the Bunny Club of the Belmont Devilliers Cultural Arts Center, is a womanist-centered night of performance art and empowerment. This year's theme, ""Ode to Black Girl Magic,"" pays homage to the black women who create universes with their art, performances and very existence. The cost is $7 at the door. Electric Lavender Lemonade, a popular FemFest cocktail of the past couple of years, is available for suggested donation. Doors open for the event at 7 p.m. and the event begins at 8 p.m. Address: 500 W. Belmont St., Pensacola.

The event, held at Pensacola Opera, begins at 7 p.m. and tickets cost $10. They can be purchased on Eventbrite, here. Address: 75 South Tarragona St., Pensacola.

Self Love Sunday, April 28: A true Sunday Funday at Chizuko will be a celebration of yourself, featuring a glitter booth, massage booth, female bands, a signature cocktail, body painting and a photo booth to capture your best “self.""

714,Photos showing girls ‘can do it all' go viral,"Portraits of girls combining sparkly dresses and sports have gone viral because of the powerful message they portray.

HMP Couture Imagery posted a photo gallery of the images to Facebook with the caption, “Because you can do it all.”

The images quickly went viral, with more than 35,000 comments and 182,000 shares since April 12.

Heather Mitchel is the photographer who runs HMP Couture Imagery.

According to Upworthy.com, the photo shoot idea stemmed from a conversation Mitchel had with other moms when her daughter started playing softball. A mom’s comment that Mitchel’s daughter wasn’t athletic bothered her so much, she channeled it into a creative idea, the photographer said.

""All I could think was, 'Why does she have to choose?' I played every sport my school offered and wore lipstick to every game,"" Mitchell told Upworthy. ""So the next day, we went to the studio and created her shot.""

Mitchel said after she posted the image of her daughter, requests for similar photos poured in and she sold out in an hour.

""I hope that every little girl that sees this series can see that there is no box,"" said Mitchell to Upworthy. ""Whatever their dreams are, they can achieve.""

718,Bus driver gives girl with neuromuscular disorder birthday surprise fit for princess,"- A Florida bus driver gave a pre-kindergarten student with a neuromuscular disorder a special birthday surprise fit for a princess.

Anna Hopson, now 5, has been riding the school bus with Arletha Sherman all of this school year to Sabal Palm Elementary School in Jacksonville, her mother Kathleen Hopson said. Sherman knew it was Anna's birthday on April 10, so she decorated the school bus with colorful streamers and a shiny “happy birthday” banner.

“I knew Ms. Sherman would want to do something special for Anna’s birthday because she loves all the kids she drives and she always goes above and beyond to make them feel safe and happy on the bus. What she did for Anna, however, was way beyond my expectations,” Kathleen said.

Anna has been riding the bus since she started preschool at 3 years old, she said. Safety was of particular concern for Kathleen, especially because Anna has Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which is a progressive neuromuscular disorder that weakens Anna's nerves and causes her muscles to degenerate, her mother said.

“She has slowly lost her ability to stand and walk independently and her condition is expected to worsen. Her hand and arm strength is weakening as well,” Kathleen said. ”Her personality is so positive, though! She’s seriously full of sunshine and she brightens the day of anyone she meets, and she’s smart and funny.”

Anna was also gifted a princess dress and tiara, along with cards, toys and hair clips from Sherman, Kathleen said.

“Anna felt so special! When she got on the bus she said, 'Is this all for me?'” her mother said. “She especially loved the twirling decorations hanging from the ceiling and the happy birthday banner.”

Kathleen said she is thankful to Sherman for making Anna feel like a real princess.

722,"Man accused of killing girl, 2 women surrenders","HAINES CITY, Fla. - The suspect in the fatal shootings of a 6-year-old Florida girl, her mother and aunt has surrendered after a statewide manhunt.

Haines City Police said 38-year-old Ernst Cherizard turned himself in Sunday. He is accused of killing Elizabelle Frenel, her 23-year-old mother, Eli Normil, and 48-year-old aunt Nicole Guillume.

Police say he fled after shooting the three at an apartment complex Friday night and had been the subject search that tracked him 200 miles away near Fort Lauderdale.

Police say Cherizard had been in a relationship with Normil.

Early Saturday, someone posted to Cherizard's Facebook account and apologized to his children. ""Daddy is so sorry with all my heart cuz I can't believe this happened,"" the post read in part.

Haines City police Chief Jim Elensky called Cherizard a monster and said Elizabelle was shot multiple times.

""Because of Cherizard's cowardly actions -- and they are nothing short of cowardly -- a family now has to bury three members, including a young child who had her whole life in front of her,"" Elensky told WPLG-TV.

Haines City police said Elizabelle Frenel, 6, Eli Normil, 23, and Nicole Guillume, 48, were fatally shot late Friday.

724,"Florida man used Instagram to lure teen across state lines and assault her, police say","The girl told police that she was sexually battered over a three-day period and was able to escape on Wednesday when Brown fell asleep. She contacted her mother and called 911.

A Florida man has been arrested and accused of using Instagram to lure a 17-year-old girl across two states to his home, then sexually assaulting her.

An arrest affidavit alleges that Richard Brown, 25, struck up a friendship with the girl via Instagram, claiming to be 19 years old and a star on the social media platform, an Orlando CBS affiliate reported. The girl allegedly told police she had run away from home and had been speaking with Brown through the app for three months until he decided to bring her to Florida.

Police say Brown paid over $800 for Uber rides that brought the girl through Texas and Louisiana and finally to his home in Apopka, Florida. The teenager told police that when she found out she had been lied to, she wanted to go home, but that he told her ""No, you owe me now for bringing you all the way here,"" an ABC affiliate reported.

The girl told police that she was sexually battered over a three-day period and was able to escape on Wednesday when Brown fell asleep. She contacted her mother and called 911.

Brown told police that he was ""only friends"" with the teen and that she had needed a place to stay. He denied having sexual contact with her and said he thought she was 18, according to the affidavit.

""We see several inconsistencies with this affidavit,"" Brown's attorney said, according to a local Fox affiliate. ""The victim said to police she met Mr. Brown through Instagram but somehow her account was hacked"" and she ""couldn't download the messages to show police.""

Brown and his attorney could not immediately be reached by The Washington Post for comment.

Brown was arrested Thursday and booked in an Orange County jail. He faces multiple felony charges, including sexual battery of a child age 12 to 17 by a person over 18; contributing to the delinquency of a minor; and sexual acts with a 16- or 17-year-old child, according to the county's website.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190326/florida-man-used-instagram-to-lure-teen-across-state-lines-and-assault-her-police-say?rssfeed=true,2019-03-26T07:50:00Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
725,Chiles' Lawton Campbell turns running injuries into touchdown receptions,"The star middle school runner who won a cross country state championship as a freshman with the Timberwolves has found a new family in flag football

Among a historically prolific Tallahassee running scene, Chiles senior Lawton Campbell was as heralded an up-and-coming runner as has come through the area.

She had five wins her eighth-grade year at Deerlake Middle School, including winning the Leon County Middle School Championship at Apalachee Regional Park in 12:11 on a two-mile course.

Campbell's thrilling ARP win came while leading a field that included five current Chiles runners – among them Emily Culley, who took second place at state at ARP as a junior; Alyson Churchill, who won a state title in 2016 on the same course; and Caitlin Wilkey, who has two top-10 state finishes at ARP.

Campbell, likewise, was going to be a star runner for the Timberwolves – maybe even the star – or so it was rumored.

“I heard a little bit of whispering about where I was going,” Campbell said. “I was zoned for Chiles and I’d always wanted to run for Chiles, so I was excited to run for Chiles High School. It was my goal to run all the way through my senior year and hopefully run as a collegiate athlete.

“That didn’t really work out well.”

In late July 2015, the summer before her freshman cross country season at Chiles, Campbell was doing a simple stride workout at Forest Meadows when she stepped on a root and rolled her ankle. She continued to run, but that night felt something was wrong.

The prognosis was she had broken it. Instead of running in regular-season meets, Campbell spent her fall in a boot, then rehabbed her way back with pool workouts.

She returned just in time for Chiles’ district meet, which allowed her the minimum needed to run in the upcoming state championships. The Timberwolves won a state title, and Campbell finished as their seventh runner.

“I was thrilled to run,” Campbell said. “I definitely didn’t run what I anticipated I’d run my freshman year, but it was nice to be on a state-winning team.”

Buy Photo Chiles' Olivia Miller, Alexandra Wallace and Lawton Campbell celebrate a fourth-place finish in the 4x800 relay. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Based on her time, Campbell wound up as second-team All-Big Bend runner.

During her spring track season, she ran five two-mile races (personal record 11:08), four one-mile races (PR 5:13), a couple 800-meter runs (PR 2:22), and she was a part of Chiles’ fourth-place 4x800 relay team at state. She was named second-team All-Big Bend.

All seemed good. But it wasn’t.

Campbell was overcompensating for the initial ankle injury, which affected her hips and growth plates that weren’t yet fused as she grew. That resulted in her spine getting out of alignment. Further rest and rehabilitation rehab was needed.

“I hit the wall,” Campbell said. “My dad, who was a professional athlete in tennis, and I always talked about peaking and we were always real cautious. We never went crazy, never wanted to peak in middle school.

“Unfortunately, it kind of seems like my career as a runner peaked in middle school. But it was just a series of bad luck. It was one injury resulting in the next and the next. It snowballed.”

Fighting sophomore year during cross-country season just to see if she could have a track season, a trip to Tallahassee Orthopedic Clinic resulted in words she never thought she’d hear.

She shouldn’t run.

“They didn’t see a good future,” Campbell said. “They said it would keep escalating. It was frustrating. It was a loss for me. That was my identity, as a runner. It was almost like I was mourning a death.”

Campbell hung around her teammates through track season. But she was just the girl helping out with meet tasks. There was no running. The camaraderie she had long enjoyed on side-by-side runs was gone.

“It was a life-changing adjustment,” Campbell said. “Ever since then it has been about how do I overcome and respond to adversity.”

Then one day Campbell’s mom got an email from another track mom about a flag football interest meeting at Chiles.

“My mom said, ‘Lawton, you need to be active. You’re missing out, and I know you’re a competitor,’” Campbell recalled. “My dad really encouraged me, but I didn’t want to do it. They didn’t force me to do anything, but they really encouraged me to do it. I went in there with an open mind.”

She played some fall ball her junior year and enjoyed it. That turned into powder puff, then her first flag football season last spring. Though, just for good measure, she got injured during the season.

“I have no luck,” Campbell said. “It’s not my go-to sport, but I’m having a great time, honestly.

“It’s a completely different atmosphere and environment. There’s running, which is a great way to do what I love the most, but it’s really cool picking up something new.”

As a junior, Campbell had experienced skill position players around her to carry the load.

This year, she is the experience and has proven her worth as a captain and at receiver. Campbell has 30 catches for 260 yards and five touchdowns as the Timberwolves have gone 8-4 heading into Monday night’s district semifinal game against Lincoln.

“I don’t play any defense. I’m not a flag-puller. I don’t really like the contact. I just like to run, turn over my shoulder, and see if the ball is there.”

In a Senior Night win this past Thursday against Pace, Campbell was a deep threat, catching two long passes in the first half. The latter was a short out-route that she turned into a 40-yard sprint down the sideline to beat a defender to the pylon for a last-second touchdown.

The wheels are still there.

“Never in a million years would I have said this is where I would be when I entered freshman year,” Campbell said. “I would have told you I’d be breaking five minutes in the mile or setting records or going to state or going to run in college somewhere awesome. The thing I have learned the most is when handed adversity, it’s the champions that respond properly that come out on top.

“I’ve really tried to focus my efforts on getting better and not focusing on the setbacks. Flag football has been a great opportunity. I love it.”

Don’t sleep on the Timberwolves

While Class 1A No. 2 Godby (11-1) and No. 8 Florida High (10-1) will meet Monday night in a volatile district semifinal as the 7:30 game at Gene Cox Stadium, the earlier 6 p.m. game features two unranked teams.

Lincoln (5-7) has been as high as No. 7 this season while starting 4-1. But the Trojans lost six in a row during the regular season to fall from the rankings. Lincoln's season-ending upset over Florida High helped clinch a top sub-district seed.

Chiles, despite going 8-4, has not yet cracked the rankings despite securing back-to-back victories over ranked Lincoln, 20-7, and ranked Madison County, 25-13.

That could change if the Timberwolves can pull off another so-called upset of the reigning district champs.

“We’ve been off the radar and people haven’t paid attention to us until we beat Lincoln and Madison,” Chiles senior quarterback Rachel Myrick said. “Finally, we started hearing our name again. That just makes me want to win even more, win all of it. I know Lincoln will come in strong, but if we play the way we have been and play our game, I think we can pull it out.”

Myrick, who is left-handed, and sophomore Sam Wilson, who is right-handed, have been in full sharing mode at quarterback and receiver since Wilson came up from JV at the end of last season.

While Chiles made the district semifinals last year, the Timberwolves were also very predictable offensively. They lost 26-0 to Godby.

This year, the backfield combo has worked smoothly, though Myrick has been used primarily at receiver and in catching passes out of the backfield in two-quarterback sets. She has 30 catches for 400 yards and six touchdowns.

“Having two quarterbacks that throw with each hand has allowed us to throw a lot of double passes,” Myrick said. “Sam coming up last year was a change for me. I’d always played quarterback and had never played receiver. This year, I feel like I’ve played a good role at receiver. I understand now from playing both positions how one can help the other.”

Said Chiles coach Stan Goldstein: “I don’t think we’re very predictable. We have two people capable of running the offense, whether that’s run or pass.”

Wilson, who has passed for over 1,400 yards with 17 touchdowns has reliable targets in Myrick, senior Lawton Campbell, and juniors Molly Hennessy (33 catches, 480 yards, 7 TD) and Talia Miller (48 catches, 300 yards).

While the production has been good, the wins have been even better. And Chiles has done it despite returning just four varsity players.

“I’m very proud of them,” Myrick said. “We do have a lot of new girls that have never done this before. I feel like we’ve come so far as a team from the beginning of the season. They came in, learned what they needed to do, and they’re very good at their certain roles.”",http://rssfeeds.tallahassee.com/~/601037802/0/tallahassee/home~Chilesapos-Lawton-Campbell-turns-running-injuries-into-touchdown-receptions/,2019-04-20T22:39:28Z,Tallahassee Democrat,Couple,"277 N Magnolia Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA",FL,32301

Broward County Mayor Mark Bogen released a statement Friday saying a Broward County Sheriff's Office deputy who was captured on cellphone video banging a 15-year-old boy's head into the ground during an arrest should be fired. ""The behavior of these Broward Sheriff's Office deputies was outrageous and unacceptable,"" said Bogen. ""The officer who jumped on the student, punched the student and banged his head to the ground should be fired immediately. There is no excuse for a law enforcement officer to harm a teenager who was on the ground and who gave no resistance. I also have a problem with the deputy who threw the student to the ground after he pepper sprayed him. After being sprayed, the teen held his face and walked away. If the deputy wanted to arrest the student, he could have easily done so without throwing him to the ground. I hope the appropriate authorities investigate this conduct and take the appropriate action."" The incident between the teen and deputy was captured on cellphone video by a group of teens who told a Miami TV station they had gathered at the McDonald's after school to watch two teens fight.Cellphone video appears to show one deputy who responded to the scene restraining a teenager in the parking lot when another deputy pushes away a girl who appeared to grab a phone from the ground.The sheriff of Broward County issued this video statement:The same deputy then uses pepper spray on the teen who appeared in court Friday after the teen appears to intervene.

728,"Happy Easter, sweet Momma","Rev. Candace McKibben (Photo: Candace McKibben)

When in April of 2015 my sweet daddy lay dying in the hospital bed hospice had put into place the evening before, I could not imagine how I would live without him. He was my hero, my inspiration, the one who encouraged me to keep going whenever I wondered how I could.

As my sweet mother lies dying now in the same room, the feeling of grief is much different for me. It is not about the future and going forward as it felt with my daddy’s passing. This grief feels far more deep-rooted than far-reaching, like the taproot of my soul. In ways I had not realized until now, I see that my mother anchored me while my father gave me wings.

I have certainly read about and heard from fellow pilgrims on grief’s journey, that life shifts when you lose both parents, when you become as the literature says, an “adult orphan.” I know I will have to process those universal feelings in my own unique way. But I do not want that to conceal the particular loss I am feeling as my mother is leaving this world.

Like many mothers and daughters, our relationship was not without its issues. My mother wanted for her three children more opportunities than she was afforded in her childhood and it was her discipline financially and otherwise that created these possibilities. I have mistaken her insistence on excellence as her own drive for perfectionism visited upon us.

As the compliant, people-pleasing first child, I lapped it up more than my siblings. But as I sit by her dying bed, I see through a heart filled with gratitude for all she sacrificed for me, that her insistence was less about her and more about who she wanted us to be.

Many wise persons have said that grief can soften our perspectives and in short order what we remember most will not be the difficult or hurtful times with those we have lost, but the good and happy times. It is already true regarding my mother. Grace and forgiveness, mercy and love, wash over my spirit as I watch and wait as she moves closer to death.

Bowing flowers honor Carolyn's passing. (Photo: Candace McKibben)

Today all the family that was able gathered in her one room apartment to tell her goodbye, each with particular stories of how much she means to them. Those who were unable to be present spoke over cell phones with video connections about their gratitude for her love and generosity.

Barely responsive otherwise, she opened her eyes wide and raised her eyebrows in recognition of each new voice. Listening to her grown grandchildren thanking her for her love and telling of their plans to have a celebration preparing all of their favorite Grandma Carter recipes was such a comfort to me.

And I believe that through the dementia and her failing life, Mama felt their enthusiasm and it was strength to her soul for her journey home.

Four years ago, my sweet daddy died the Wednesday before Easter Sunday. While a very busy and important time for a minister to part with her father, it has also proved to be a very comforting time.

The hope that Easter espouses has become all the more real and powerful to me as I remember my father. This year that hope is doubled as I remember not only a father but a mother whose death date falls in this holy season. Remembering them together is sweet and feels right.

My mother’s favorite color is yellow and I try to always have fresh yellow flowers for her in her room. With all that has gone on this week, replenishing her flowers has not been a priority. When I noticed the flowers on her dresser, what I saw was not the wilting leaves or the dropped petals, but a number of flowers that had simply bowed their heads as if in respect for my mother’s passing.

The bowed flowers captured my grateful heart for an amazing mother, role model, and friend who not only taught me well during her lifetime, but also in her steady, slow progression to death. Thank you, sweet momma, for giving me a chance to realize my great fortune in not only being a daddy’s girl but the daughter of a remarkable woman.

Happy Easter in a land that is fairer than day. I love you.

729,Parents warn others after 11-year-old suffers fatal reaction to toothpaste,"WEST COVINA, Calif. – The parents of a Southern California girl who they say died of an allergic reaction to toothpaste containing milk are speaking out to warn others.

Parents Monique Altamirano and Jose Saldate, both 43, told Yahoo Lifestyle they had EpiPens and had always taken great care to avoid anything that might trigger their daughter’s severe dairy allergy.

Vigilant about packing safe meals to take to birthday parties and reading the fine print on food labels, the parents said they had never seen milk in toothpaste before, and allowed her to use a medicated toothpaste prescribed by her dentist, MI Paste One.

“I did not think to look at the product ingredients,” Altamirano told Allergic Living. “She was just excited to have her special toothpaste.”

On April 4, Denise started brushing her teeth with the new toothpaste that was supposed to help her enamel, and she immediately began crying, her mother said.

Altamirano said her daughter’s lips were already turning blue when she got to her mother’s room, and, despite administering the EpiPen and an asthma inhaler, Denise was unable to breathe. Her mother, a former school bus driver, tried to revive her using chest compressions but the sixth grader died later that night after being rushed to the hospital.

What Denise’s family didn’t see was a small warning on the toothpaste tube about the ingredient Recaldent, a milk protein that bonds with the surface of teeth.

Now, Denise’s parents are urging other parents of children with allergies to “read everything.”

“Don’t get comfortable, just because you’ve been managing for several years,” Monique told Allergic Living. “You can’t get comfortable or be embarrassed or afraid to ask and ensure that ingredients are OK. Be that advocate for your child.”

A GoFundMe called Denise “a loving daughter, sister, cousin, niece, and friend with such an amazing personality” who had her own YouTube channel and “was a born leader.”

Memorial services are planned for April 26 and 27; guests are encouraged to wear bright colors “to celebrate Denise’s bright personality.”",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/04/19/parents-warn-others-after-11-year-old-suffers-fatal-reaction-to-toothpaste/,2019-04-19T13:04:43Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394

732,Police: Man accused of shooting 2 teens found hiding in attic,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A man accused of shooting two teenagers last month burst a pipe in the attic and fell through a bathroom ceiling covered in asbestos when investigators showed up last Thursday to arrest him at his family's apartment, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said.

Justus Milan Harp, 20, is charged with two counts of attempted murder in the shooting of a pair of teenagers in March in the parking lot of the Courtney Manor Apartments on Collins Road in Ortega Hills.

Police said two friends, ages 18 and 16, were seriously injured in the shooting and two vehicles and an apartment unit were damaged by stray bullets.

Officers went to Harp's apartment last Thursday to serve a warrant on the attempted murder charges and at first, couldn't find him inside, according to his arrest report.

His mother, his 13-year-old sister and a 19-year-old woman were in the Baymeadows Road apartment.

Police said Harp's mother admitted he was in the apartment when the officers came back a second time. After the two women and the girl were safely out of the apartment, a K-9 team came in and officers found an entrance to the attic in a bedroom closet, the report said.

One of the officers spotted Harp hiding under a pile of asbestos when he reached up to grab onto a PVC pipe. Harp then fell through the ceiling and the pipe burst, sending water gushing into the apartment below, police said.

An officer took Harp, who was covered with asbestos, into custody, police said.

Harp is being held on a $1 million bond.

733,Former foster child testifies in Sarasota sex abuse trial,"North Port man is accused of committing acts on girl who was 3 at the time

SARASOTA — Wearing a pink dress and braided hair, a young girl took the witness stand Tuesday and spoke in low, mumbling tones.

With her golden retriever therapy dog watching from the audience, the child repeated what she had told police investigators a year earlier — that her former foster father had approached her in a bedroom and put “his pee-pee” in her mouth.

Her testimony — spoken haltingly and quietly in a breathless circuit courtroom — is central to the case that the state is building against 64-year-old Gilberto Rios, a longtime foster father in North Port who is charged with sexual battery against the then-3-year-old girl.

In his defense, attorneys representing Rios used their opening arguments to ask the four-woman, four-man jury to keep in mind that Rios and his wife, Nereida, fostered hundreds of children over the past 25 years in Pennsylvania and Florida.

Attorney Jeffrey Young promised that caseworkers and other state employees would testify they were a “wonderful foster family.”

“Everybody seemed to be happy, they were caring for the children, they would get them to school, to doctor’s appointments, to Disney World,” Young said. “There’s no witnesses, nobody who said they saw anything; there’s no physical evidence.”

But the accusations for which Rios is being tried are not the first to surface.

In an article Tuesday, GateHouse Media detailed suspicions voiced by two parents and a former case manager that four more children were allegedly abused by Rios. One mother said she told the Department of Children & Families in 2016 that both of her daughters had been molested. But DCF could not substantiate her claims and continued placing children with Rios and his wife.

Tuesday afternoon, as the first witnesses took the stand, DCF announced it would review its policy on placing children with foster parents previously accused of abuse, even if unconfirmed.

“I, and all the employees of DCF, are appalled by the allegations in this case,” DCF Secretary Chad Poppell said in a statement Tuesday. “A foster care placement should be a safe place where we would be comfortable sending our own children.”

Rios, who appeared in a black suit jacket with a small oxygen tank, did not speak on the first day of his trial.

The investigation into his alleged abuse was triggered in 2018, when the now 7-year-old’s adoptive mother overheard her tell her older sister that she had once “bit” a man’s penis.

When questioned further, her daughter “shut down,” the mother testified. Three days later, on their way to therapy, the girl disclosed that the man in question was Rios. The mother called the abuse hotline the next day.

“She was placed there for safety and security, but it became a house of horrors,” Assistant State Attorney Brooke Kernan told the jury in her opening arguments.

Prior to the girl’s disclosure, family members also noticed the girl playing with Barbie dolls, stripping them naked, and simulating sex acts with them, according to testimony from the mother and an older sister.

The typically bubbly and cheerful young girl also displayed other worrisome behaviors, according to witnesses.

Guardian ad litem Marca Markwitz testified that while the girl seemed otherwise happy and well-cared for in the Rios home, she also had issues with potty training and smearing feces on the walls.

When Markwitz suggested the child go to therapy, Nereida Rios was resistant.

“I asked her didn’t she think she should see a therapist and Ms. Rios said no, we can handle it,” Markwitz said.

Markwitz also said she rarely, if ever, saw the couple’s two teenage children or their adopted son during visits.

Later in the week, jurors are expected to hear the testimony of a second former foster child who told investigators years earlier that she was also sexually abused by Rios while in his care.

The two children’s placements at the Rios home overlapped, according to testimony from child welfare workers.

Rios’ attorneys moved to block the testimony, raising concerns about inconsistencies in her story. But Judge Charles Roberts overruled their motion on grounds that the second child’s testimony had “striking and significant” similarities.

735,Lawmakers back off public records exemption for foster parent names,"Florida lawmakers backed off a proposal Tuesday that sought to conceal the names of foster parents through new public record exemptions.

The move came on the same day GateHouse Media reported allegations of child sex abuse against Gilberto Rios, who fostered 48 children with his wife since 2009.

On trial this week over charges that he sexually abused a 3-year-old girl in his care, Rios faced similar allegations from another foster girl two years earlier, GateHouse Media found — yet state officials continued to place children in his home.

Experts say the case illustrates why foster parents, who receive funding from the state of Florida, should not be exempt from public oversight. But that’s exactly what Florida legislators, backed by the Department of Children & Families, intended. A pair of bills making their way through the House and Senate would have protected the identities of foster parents, which are now public record under Florida statutes.

The bills came in response to a records request made by GateHouse and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune in July 2018 as part of an ongoing investigation into alleged misconduct of foster parents. The organizations asked for a list of all foster parents in the state. But even though DCF officials agreed that the names were not exempt under current public records law, they declined the request and then set about changing the law.

But on the heels of allegations against Rios, state lawmakers on the Florida House of Representatives Health and Human Services Committee amended the bill on Tuesday to instead conceal just the names of foster parents who operate human trafficking safe houses — refuges for children once engaged in the sex trade.

“These homes are notoriously difficult to keep open because traffickers find out where the children are,” said Robert Latham, a professor and associate director of the University of Miami Children & Youth Law Clinic. He estimates it removes maybe 10 or 20 names from the list of foster parents.

In a statement emailed to GateHouse Media, DCF Secretary Chad Poppell denied that his organization was trying to hide anything from public view.

“DCF is absolutely committed to transparency and accountability, and we have no tolerance for any abuse of any kind by any caregiver,” Poppell wrote. “The intent of HB 1249 is to provide protection to make foster parents and children in their care feel safe. However, we recognize there is a balance with transparency and accountability.”

Co-sponsors of the proposed legislation — Rep. Spencer Roach, R-North Fort Myers, and Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City — had argued the measure was necessary to protect foster parents against reprisal from biological parents.

But some child welfare advocates feared it would go too far — potentially putting vulnerable children further at risk.

The Children’s Campaign sent a call for action Tuesday to demonstrate opposition to earlier versions of the bill, citing the Herald-Tribune’s reporting as evidence.

“We felt like it removed transparency and accountability in the foster system,” said Roy Miller, president and founder of The Children’s Campaign. “The Rios trial just confirms all of our concerns.”

As of Tuesday, the Senate version of the bill remained unchanged.

“This bill and the associated amendment exemplify the risk many foster parents endure when caring for children who also happen to be victims of human trafficking,” Overdorf said before the Health and Human Services Committee. “Parents who care for these commercially, sexually exploited children are at an increased risk due to the relationship between human trafficking and various forms of associated violence.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190416/lawmakers-back-off-public-records-exemption-for-foster-parent-names?rssfeed=true,2019-04-16T20:05:39Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

743,Girl bitten by shark at Crescent Beach while celebrating her 10th birthday,"A Macclenny girl was bitten by a shark late Friday afternoon in the waters off Crescent Beach.

Peyton Shields turned 10 last week and for her birthday, she and her family left their Baker County home to spend the weekend at the Four Winds condominiums on A1A. They had only been at the beach for about an hour at the time of the shark attack.

Peyton, who had been boogie boarding, said she was in waist-deep water about 5:45 p.m. Friday when she was bitten on both knees by a shark. She said she tried to push it away and she was bitten on her left hand before the shark swam off.

Her parents saw her screaming and struggling in the water. Her father, Steven Shields, told News4Jax that a shark bite was the last thing that went through his head, saying he thought she was yelling because she had thought had been stung by a jellyfish. But then he saw the blood coming from her legs.

Peyton's parents put pressure on the wounds and called 911. Other children were in the water with Peyton, but she was the only one bitten, according to a St. Johns County Sheriff's Office report.

She was taken to Flagler Hospital, where she got about 40 stitches and she was bandaged up.

Fortunately, Peyton was still able to celebrate at her birthday party Saturday in the condo.

Her parents said Peyton had a follow-up doctor's appointment Monday afternoon. Though Peyton, who's on spring break this week, was bummed she was unable to get in the water again over the weekend after the shark attack, she said that as soon as she's cleared by a doctor, she can't wait to get back in the ocean.

According to News4Jax records, there has been one shark bite so far this year in the Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia area. Last year, there were four reported shark bites in that area. There were three locally recorded shark bites in 2017.

744,"Grant Amato 'unable to function' without cam girl before family's slaying, letter shows","Excerpts form a letter written by Grant Amato to an online community whom he shared a relationship with a cam girl in the months before his father, mother and brother were killed.

SEMINOLE COUNTY, Fla. - Before prosecutors say Grant Amato killed his parents and brother, he sent a letter to an online porn group involved with the woman to whom he sent more than $200,000, apologizing for lying about his lifestyle; however, he didn’t say the money was stolen from his family before they ultimately found out three months before the deaths.

That apology letter, documents and video interviews with Amato were released Monday by prosecutors as part of the case against the 29-year-old accused of killing his family after he says they forced him to cut ties with a woman with whom he formed a relationship via the website MyFreeCams, where people can pay women for sexual photos and videos.

Grant Amato’s parents, Chad and Margaret, along with his brother, Cody Amato, 31, were fatally shot at their Chuluota home Jan. 25. Photos and other evidence from the home shows Cody Amato was shot as soon as he walked in the door. He was still wearing his green hospital scrubs after returning home from work at Orlando Health, according to the discovery.

Records show Grant Amato had argued with his family in the months leading up to the shooting because he had stolen $200,000 from his father and brother to wire to a Bulgarian cam girl, called Silvie, with whom he had an online relationship on the website MyFreeCams.

“My family found out about her, the website and all the money I had been spending on everything,” Amato wrote in the eight-page apology letter to the online group also involved with the woman.

After learning about the relationship and the stolen funds in November, his family sent Grant Amato to a rehabilitation center for internet and sex addiction, according to investigators.

In a letter written sometime after the suspect left the rehabilitation center on Jan. 9, Amato tells his MyFreeCams friends he stayed there until he was “able convince my family that I was fine and able to be released.”

According to recorded interviews and in Amato’s own words, he felt misunderstood by his family.

“My father is controlling and abusive, my mother is simply around for the security and my brother is also controlling and does not understand how I could care for someone as much as I care for Silvie,"" Grant Amato wrote.

Amato apologizes to his online friends, saying, “I am not a professional gamer, did not own my own house and did not drive a BMW,"" adding “while the money I have, the tips I gave and the way that I was and am are my true personality and way of being.”

At least $200,000 he used for the MyFreeCams website to send to Silvie was stolen from his father and brother, according to investigators.

It’s unclear if any of Amato’s own money was also used to fund the online relationship, which involved sending Silvie gifts including flowers and outfits, the letter shows. Users are encouraged to ""tip"" the models on the website.

The cam girl had cut ties with Amato in January, according to the letter, because while he was in rehab, his “family had hacked my computer at home, gained access to my phone records and all my personal things related to Silvie.” The Amato family also contacted Silvie, according to the letter.

Excerpts form a letter written by Grant Amato to an online community whom he shared a relationship with a cam girl in the months before his father, mother and brother were killed.

By January, Amato wrote he was reduced ""to only being able to send her DM’s on her public Twitter.”

Amato was devastated about losing contact and access to the woman. He writes, “I am unable to function normally without her,” and, “I will never get over her.”

The 29-year-old entered a not guilty plea in March to three counts of first-degree murder. He faces the death penalty if convicted.

He continues to deny his role in the slayings, according to jail messages also released on Monday.

A message written by Grant Amato from the Seminole County jail to a legal advocate.

Amato was worried about his nursing license and requested several “The King Killer Chronicle” books. A criminal defense mitigation expert advised him, “please don’t worry about your nursing license … there are much bigger things happening now,"" messages from March 12 show.

“This is not some drama, it’s the greatest tragedy of my life that I am being wrongfully accused of,” Amato wrote to a reporter in March.

Before his Jan. 28 arrest, Amato sought access to the online porn community group again, according to his letter.

Amato wrote, “I wish I could simply say that everyone deserves a chance to right their wrongs, but unfortunately it is not up to me.”

745,100 rescued from rip currents along Florida's coast,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - Lifeguards rescued more than 100 people from rough surf along a stretch of beaches on Florida's Atlantic coast.

Volusia County Ocean Rescue Capt. Mike Berard said lifeguards rescued 48 people Saturday and at least 55 Sunday.

Those rescued included a 7-year-old girl pulled into the ocean by strong rip currents. Berard says the child and another child in nearby New Smyrna Beach were taken to hospitals as a precaution.

[WHAT TO KNOW: Rip currents, warning flags]

Berard says the rip currents were ""pretty bad"" over the weekend as spring break crowds flocked to the beaches.

What to do if caught in a rip current

If you do find yourself caught in a rip current, there are a few steps you should take to escape the pull.

First, do not panic. If you begin to get tired, turn on your back and float for a few seconds to rest your arms and legs.

Next, start swimming parallel to the coastline until you begin to feel the pull relax.

From there, start swimming back to shore at an angle. Many panicked swimmers try swimming straight back to shore. That causes them to swim directly against the current, which increases their risk of drowning due to fatigue.

What do those flags mean?

One of the first things beachgoers should do when arriving at the beach is to look for the colored beach flag, located near lifeguard towers. These flags are posted to identify different tide and surf conditions in that area. This nationwide warning flag system was adopted by the International Lifesaving Federation.

No matter the day or the color of the flag, it is always best to swim near a lifeguard and never let your guard down while you’re in the water.

Enjoy the beach season, have fun and stay safe.

A Florida couple left one of their eight children behind at a park after a family outing Friday night and didn't report the toddler missing until nearly noon Saturday, deputies said.

Jolanda Larose Alexandre and Makenson Alexandre, 34, told the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office they didn't realize they'd left the 2-year-old girl behind.

Passersby found the child ""wandering alone"" at Haverhill Park on Friday evening just before sunset, deputies said.

When deputies were called, they spent about three hours trying to find the girl’s caregivers, including making loudspeaker announcements and bringing in search and rescue dogs, the sheriff's office said.

The department had no idea whom the girl belonged to until the Alexandres called authorities the next day, deputies said.

The Alexandres were arrested and charged with child neglect, and officials with the Florida Department of Children and Families also removed the remaining seven children from the home, deputies said.

The girl had been left behind at about 7 p.m. Friday and was missing for more than 14 hours, according to the sheriff's office.

At about 8 a.m. Saturday, the sheriff's office posted a photo of the girl, who turns 3 this Thursday, asking ""Does anyone know who this little beautiful baby girl belongs to?"" with a ""heartbroken"" emoji on Facebook.

""We were dumbfounded. We were so upset,"" PBSO Public Information Officer Teri Barbera said, adding that the girl was in ""great condition,"" dressed nicely in a pink “Adorable” T-shirt and white tutu, and otherwise seemed to be generally well cared-for.

Jolanda Alexandre told authorities she had taken all the kids to the park to let them play for about an hour after picking Makenson up from work, then told them to get back into the minivan before she drove home and let them continue playing outside their apartment, according to a probable cause affidavit released Monday morning.

Jolanda Alexandre said she thought the little girl was with all the other kids but that on Saturday morning after she woke up, she and Makenson realized at about 9 a.m. that the toddler was missing, according to the affidavit.

753,St. Matthew's House graduates show what's possible after addiction recovery,"Nick Matson wakes up enthusiastic over what the day may bring.

Same for the next day, the next month.

His outlook is a stark contrast from two years ago. He expected to die from a heroin overdose.

The Naples native has come full circle from addiction to recovery. He owns a local moving company, Matson Movers.

“It makes me feel like, wow,” Matson, 25, said. “I did it. I actually started something and it’s working. I’m a business guy. It makes me feel accomplished.”

Nick Matson, right, laughs with his dad, Arthur Matson, while they eat breakfast at Nana's Diner in Golden Gate on Tuesday, April 9, 2019. Nick decided to quit drugs after overdosing in early 2017 and went through the Justin's Place Recovery Program at St. Matthew's House. Nick saw the need for a delivery service while working at the thrift stores run by St. Matthew's House in Naples, and he decided to start his own moving company with the help of his father. (Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Matson credits Justin’s Place Recovery Program at St. Matthew’s House, a year-long Christian-based substance abuse recovery program with boot camp-like rules. St. Matthew’s House also runs homeless shelters, a soup kitchen, and several businesses that graduates of the program help operate.

The program is highly structured to help people develop life skills — often for the first time — to be accountable and productive.

After a 28-day stay at Justin’s Place in East Naples, men spend six months at the remote Port LaBelle Inn and Conference Center, which St. Matthew’s House purchased in 2014. The capacity is 70 men.

While taking part in recovery sessions, they work in food service, the laundry room, maintenance or other capacities to support St. Matthew’s and the inn that is available for retreats.

Women stay at Jill’s Place Retreat Center, an 11-acre property with four residences in Alva for skills training and personal growth. The capacity is limited to 32 women year-round; only 25 percent of applicants can be served because of the limited capacity.

The next step for men is transitional housing at Wolfe Apartments in Golden Gate. Program participants work at one of the ""social enterprise"" businesses run by St. Matthew's House. That could be one of its thrift stores, the car wash, café or catering business. The goal is learning how to balance life and work.

The program has graduated 470 former substance abusers since it began in 2010. They are tracked for two years for sobriety and there is an 87 percent success rate, according to St. Matthew's House.

Some graduates have started their own businesses, earned degrees and have careers with opportunities.

“They gave me my life back,” Matson said. “I was going to die if I didn’t get help. I just thought I was going to die a heroin addict.”

Stan Schoenewald, whose alcohol abuse led to kidney failure and dialysis for five months, is a fitness trainer at Kensington Country Club, Wyndemere Country Club and the Greater Naples YMCA.

He stayed two years at Wolfe Apartments as a caseworker after completing the program.

“The more I stayed, the more I learned,” Schoenewald, 40, said. “I realized it was not a quick fix.”

Jesenia Martinez, 41, wanted to die after losing her three kids because of drugs. She’s been off drugs for five years and is customer relations manager at Naples Nissan.

“I see St. Matthew’s House as a stepping stone that God used to pull me out of the darkness,” Martinez said.

Working the program

After graduating Gulf Coast High School in 2011, Matson worked in local restaurants where drugs were often plentiful.

“I didn’t have a purpose,” he said.

He used opioids, including Oxycontin, and progressed to shooting heroin.

“I started losing everything,” he said. “I ran my car on Alligator Alley going 85 mph into the canal.”

One night at his drug dealer’s place, he couldn’t get a vein. The dealer’s girlfriend injected him.

He faintly recalls being shoved up against a wall and water spraying him. He realized later he was carried into the shower.

Matson woke up in a hospital bed. He had overdosed. His dealer had not wanted a dead man in his home and called an ambulance.

In the hospital bed, Matson had time to think. He checked himself into the recovery program.

“I realized I am not invincible,” he said.

He worked in the laundry room in LaBelle and liked how the men helped one another stick to the program.

After moving to Wolfe Apartments, he worked for two of the thrift stores run by St. Matthew's House in Naples. Customers kept asking about delivery service. That’s when he came up with idea of starting a moving business.

(Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

He pitched the idea to Vann Ellison, president and chief executive officer of St. Matthew’s House, who blessed it. He pitched it to his father, Arthur Matson, a retired marine law enforcement officer.

Through the thrift store manager, Matson learned of a box truck available for $17,000. The sum seemed insurmountable.

He and his father made the rounds to banks for a loan, but Matson lacked business experience. His father ultimately put up the money. Matson Movers launched in late 2017.

His father helped with the physical work in the early months. Word spread from thrift stores clerks and repeat customers.

“It all just fell into place,” Matson said. “Business is rolling. In the last four months, I have not had one losing week.”

He’s up at 4:30 a.m. weekdays to work out at Iron Tribe Fitness in North Naples. He’s muscular at 240 pounds, a far cry from when he weighed 160 pounds as an addict.

“I was a skeleton,” he said.

He goes to an AA meeting after working out and then to Nana’s Diner in Golden Gate to meet his father and his only employee, Kenny McAdams. He and his father prefer burgers at breakfast.

At jobs, Matson is upbeat and chats with customers. He knows customer service is critical for repeat business. He plans to expand from local moving to more distant moving jobs.

A Biblical verse from Galatians on the side of his truck says: “Don’t forget where you came from.”

It’s a reminder his good fortune could turn on a dime if he ever uses drugs again.

“I know I could lose everything in a second,” Matson said.

From booze to brawn

Schoenewald moved from Williamstown, New Jersey, to the Jersey Shore town of Sea Isle after high school. He worked in restaurants and fell into the party lifestyle at night.

Everybody did it. He got up every morning on time and worked hard. He moved up in the restaurant world. All seemed fine.

He landed a job as a sous chef in Atlantic City, a town he describes as the “devil’s playground.”

Drugs are everywhere. He made good money and spent it. He used cocaine and opioids. Even his high tolerance for Jameson Irish whiskey dumbfounded him. He kept functioning.

One morning after a big night, he woke to find the left side of his body distorted from swelling. He went to an emergency room. He was in kidney failure at the age of 25.

“They knew why, the alcohol and drugs,” Schoenewald said. “My body was shutting down.”

He was put on dialysis. Doctors couldn’t say if it would be permanent. He stayed off alcohol. Five months later he was given a clean bill of health.

“I went back to the same place, the same people,” Schoenewald said. “A month later I said I will have a sip of whiskey and nothing happened. It probably took me two weeks before I was firing on all cylinders like before.”

He was miserable. After visiting his older brother in Fort Myers, he moved there. He got a job at a popular eatery and fell back into the party lifestyle.

He got a girl pregnant and they married after their daughter was born. He got arrested for drunken driving.

In driving school, the instructor talked about the signs of alcoholism. The only one Schoenewald didn’t check off was drinking in the morning.

“I don’t know why in my head I decided I had to be the best alcoholic I could. It doesn’t make sense,” he said. “I started drinking in the morning. It took the edge off, so I started drinking all day.”

His wife kicked him out. He wasn’t allowed to see his daughter. He lost jobs. He was consuming a 1.75 liter bottle of Captain Morgan or Jameson daily.

“Now I was in my pity party,” Schoenewald said. “I felt sorry for myself. I felt the walls were caving in on me. I felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest.”

Suicide as a way out

He thought people in his life would be better without him. He tied a sheet around his neck and the other end to a rafter to strangle himself. He did not stand on a chair.

“I felt myself blacking out and all of a sudden I felt like I had a purpose but I didn’t know what it was,” he said.

It was the middle of the afternoon in December 2014. He was able to loosen the sheet. He prayed for help. He prayed for a commercial to come on television for an addiction recovery program.

Those commercials usually run in the wee hours of the night, but that day, within five minutes, a commercial for Passages Malibu recovery program or something similar, came on.

He called and learned the program cost $40,000. The woman on the phone suggested he finance it. He hung up.

Schoenewald called his sister-in-law for help. She got him the number to Justin’s Place. When he learned the program lasts one year, his family urged him to go.

He started the program in January 2015. It took him a month to break out of his shell.

In LaBelle, he worked in the kitchen. He read the Bible and began to feel alive.

“Working the steps, you see people start changing, to get a glow about them,” he said.

He began running and built up his stamina. He helped get exercise equipment from the thrift stores to LaBelle.

At the Wolfe Apartments, he became an intern to help others and moved up to a caseworker position.

He applied for a $1,500 scholarship through a program at St. Matthew’s House to get certified as a personal trainer.

One day at Naples Church on Immokalee Road, he struck up a conversation with a woman next to him. She turned out to be the fitness director at Kensington Country Club. They stayed in touch. She hired him as an attendant at Kensington.

“God put all the right people in my path,” he said. “She plugged me into Wyndemere and at the YMCA.”

He received two more scholarships from St. Matthew’s for spinning instructor certification and to teach classes.

He has run the Fort Myers Marathon, the Chicago and New York marathons and plans to run the Boston Marathon next year.

He’s up at 4:15 a.m. and reads the Bible before heading to Crunch gym.

“I’ve learned if I get up and do something for myself, I can give to people all day,” Schoenewald said.

Gang life to car dealership

Martinez dropped out of school in Miami after sixth grade and joined a gang.

“The gang was my family,” she said. “I felt protected.”

She broke into homes and was around drugs all the time. She lived in the fast lane until a friend was shot and killed near where she lived. She was 17 and wanted out. She moved to Naples to live with her mother.

She held odd jobs and kept returning to Miami where she met a man and married. She had the first of her three kids with him at 21.

She wanted to make the marriage work and smoked crack with her husband until he became abusive. She left him and spent six months living at the Shelter for Abused Women in Naples. Her kids were 2, 3 and 4.

“I was starting from ground up,” she said. “I got a legitimate job as a car detailer.”

More: David Lawrence Center's Nancy Dauphinais speaks about opioid crisis

She struggled to make ends meet. She couch-hopped staying with friends and began smoking crack again. She sold drugs and stole food from stores to keep her kids fed.

A low point came when someone called the state Department of Children and Families and she lost custody of her children.

“I wanted to die,” Martinez said. Instead of focusing on getting her life in order she kept using. I chose the wrong way.”

She was looking at prison time after five arrests for petty theft. The judge gave her a break and seven months in jail.

""It was divine intervention,"" she said.

Jesenia Martinez poses for a portrait at Naples Nissan on Wednesday, April 17, 2019. Martinez's years-long drug habit got her kids taken away and caused her to spend seven months in jail. Shortly after her release she decided she wanted to get clean and ended up in a recovery program at St. Matthew's House, which helped her get her kids back and land a job at Naples Nissan where she works as a customer relations manager. (Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

She didn’t know how to ask for help until one night shortly after her release.

“I was sitting in a dope dealer’s house in the middle of the night on a Sunday. I was getting high and started to get really anxious,” she said. “I stood up and handed my drugs to someone and said, ‘I have to go.’”

She walked to a convenience store and told the clerk she wanted to kill herself. The clerk called the Sheriff’s Office. The deputy who responded knew her.

“He looked at me and said, ‘Are you finally done?'"" she said. ""I said, ‘Yes.’ I didn’t really know how to ask for help.”

The deputy drove her to the David Lawrence Center, a mental health and addiction treatment center in Naples.

When someone mentioned Justin’s Place, it jarred a memory. She remembered running into a former drug user who had gone to Justin's Place. She remembered how good he looked. She was ready.

“I wanted to stop, I was just so tired,” Martinez said.

She stayed in the program one year. She established a relationship with God. She no longer believed she was destined, or deserved, to be homeless and an addict.

“The devil had no power over me anymore,” Martinez said. “I am grateful to St. Matthew’s House. It helped me because I wanted it to help me.”

She got her children back and lived in Wolfe Apartments. When she was ready to buy a car, she went to Naples Nissan, which is a supporter of St. Matthew’s House.

Martinez met the general manager of the dealership. She sent prospective customers to Nissan. The general manager convinced her to come work there. He put her in the service department, where she's been since June 2016.

Her children are grown and thriving. The eldest is at the University of Florida on a scholarship and wants to go to medical school.

Martinez’s job at the dealership is to address issues customers may have with the service department. She lets them vent — if they need it — before she convinces them she is there to solve their problem.

“I pray every morning before I get here,” Martinez said. “How can I not be grateful for my life today from where I came from?

Jesenia Martinez shows off her Alice in Wonderland-themed tattoo sleeve, which is still in progress, at Naples Nissan on Wednesday, April 17, 2019. Martinez says that her tattoos remind her of when her kids were growing up. She used to wake her kids up by singing the unbirthday song, and tried her best to make every day an adventure, even when they were homeless or were going through a tough time.

FORT PIERCE — Notified earlier in the day that her medical license has been suspended, Sheetal Kanar Kumar was sentenced late Friday afternoon to two years in prison for healthcare fraud.

Two months ago, a federal court jury found the former obstetrician and gynecologist guilty of 23 of the 29 counts of scheming to commit fraud on health insurance claims made between January 2014 and July 2017 to Medicare, Medicaid and a handful of private insurers.

Though the maximum penalty for each charge was 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, federal sentencing guidelines called for a sentence of 38 months and a fine of $20,000 to $200,000.

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra rebuffed efforts by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Funk to increase the guidelines by adding enhancements based on allegations that Kumar used special skills as a doctor in filing the claims, obstructed prosecution by perjuring herself in her trial testimony and did not show acceptance or take responsibility for her crimes.

Testifying at the sentencing hearing, Kumar, 48, pleaded with Marra for any punishment that would not take her away from her three teenage children, a 17-year-old girl and twin 14-year-old boys.

Her husband, Dr. Amitabh Kumar, a gastroenterology specialist who had been sharing office space and staff with his wife, found work in Albany, Georgia, and visits the family when he can.

“Before this trial, I had a feeling about myself that I was a good person who did good things,” Kanar Kumar told the judge. “That feeling is gone, and I want to do what I can to restore that feeling.

“As far as community service, I really need it,” she pleaded. “Punish me without punishing my kids.”

One of Kumar’s attorneys, Richard Kibbey of Stuart, told Marra the situation was a “dilemmatunity,” a concept he said he learned long ago from a college professor for a situation in which a dilemma could be turned into an opportunity.

Suggesting that Kumar had accumulated some “forgiveness chips” before these crimes, Kibbey said, “Some people need to be in prison for our safety, but why imprison someone just to imprison them” when that person could be contributing to society in some other way.

Kibbey proposed to Marra a 90-day sentence Kumar would serve during the summer when her children were not in school, following by a heavy dose of community service, perhaps 40 hours a week for three years.

In delivering his sentence, Marra said, “Tragic is an inadequate description of this case.”

Marra said people with children should not be treated differently in court from those without children.

“In my view, the fact that children may be adversely affected is not a reason to avoid incarceration,” he said.

Still, Marra went below the guidelines in giving Kumar a two-year sentence and $15,000 fine.

Though prosecutors wanted Kumar remanded into custody immediately, the judge agreed to Kibbey’s requests to allow Kumar to surrender to federal marshals by noon on June 24, so she could spend time preparing her children for her absence, and to ask that she be sent to a prison in Marianna or Tallahassee, where she moved with her children after her arrest.

Funk also said Kumar should be ordered to pay $637,177 in restitution, based on testimony by FBI analyst Jennifer Minton.

Kibbey and Kumar’s other attorney, Jason Wandner of Stuart, argued that amount included repayment for claims for which she was found not guilty.

Marra agreed with part of the defense argument and reduced the figure by about $65,000, but set a hearing for June 5 in West Palm Beach to resolve the restitution.

755,"Grady wins District 2-3A tennis title as Leon, champion Chiles advance to regionals","The Lions finished as district runner-up behind the Timberwolves, who captured their fifth consecutive district championship

Leon senior Jules Grady had learned her lesson.

If she was going to beat Chiles senior Gracie Wilson in the District 2-3A finals match Thursday morning at the No. 1 singles position, she was going to have to be patient.

Extremely patient.

Grady learned that lesson when she lost to Wilson 6-2, 6-4 at the city tournament, a few courts away at Tom Brown Park.

“I had to blend how I play and how she plays because she never misses,” Grady said. “When I lost to her at city’s, I was just playing my game and wasn’t making my aggressive shots. I just had to play consistent with her and make my shots.”

Grady, last year’s All-Big Bend Co-Player of the Year and 2018 city champ, had just beaten Wilson 8-6 the week before in a pro-set, handing Wilson her first local loss since her freshman year.

With high winds pushing struck balls around varying distances, Grady casually strolled towards each shot, hitting back and forth with Wilson with a relative nonchalance. Without angst, she played a waiting game instead of trying to power balls past her gritty competitor.

Grady's reward was a 6-4, 6-4 win and her first district title. She’s the first Leon girls district champion since Mary Phillips Smith in 2011.

“I was walking to balls,” Grady said. “When we had really intense points, it was exciting because most of the points were walking back and forth to balls. It was very different.”

On top of her individual achievement, Grady watched as Leon played without injured No. 3 Abby Birkmeier – her typical No. 1 doubles partner – yet the Lions snuck ahead of Niceville for the district runner-up spot. Leon will travel to Gulf Breeze for the first round of regionals.

“It was a group effort,” Grady said. “Our 4 and 5 won in the first round. We were a team.”

Niceville struggled with early evictions from the district bracket, including seeing its 1-seed at No. 4 singles get bounced in the quarterfinals following a first-round bye.

Despite shifting its lineup with Birkmeier out, Leon picked up points in several unexpected areas.

“Katie Garland went up to 3 and won a match, and the girl she would have played at 4 she had lost to, but Grace (Netherton) ended up beating her,” Leon coach Kevin Record said. “Carsyn Dennis picked up a point at 2 against a girl she had just lost to. We picked up a point in every bracket. And Jules winning got us five points.”

TENNIS PREVIEW: Landscape among boys and girls as even as it has ever been

Record, however, experienced a reversal of expectation. He thought his Leon boys team – which recently beat Chiles 5-2 in a regular-season match to settle a tie at the city tournament – would be the one to get out of district.

With Blake Javanmardi and Will Bullen winning a finals match at No. 2 doubles, the Lions ended up tying Niceville for runner-up, then they lost in a tiebreaking pro-set dual match to finish in third. Chiles, which sent only No. 2 Brighton Jiang to the finals, was fourth.

“It was weird, and I would be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed the boys didn’t get out,” Record said. “It was a long tournament to go two days and then play a dual match.”

The dual was crucial at 3-4-5 singles. Jack Long and Bullen both won easily, but Petar Leontikj got up 3-1 before losing to a player who got hot at the right time.

“It was a good feeling to be back in the hunt,” Record said. “It has been a few years since I’ve been able to roam the courts. It felt like they were in the postseason. That was the wild-card game.”

Lincoln senior Kailey Williams made a slightly surprising run through the No. 4 singles bracket, winning as the 3-seed. After Leon’s Grace Netherton upset Chiles’ Harli Neshat in the quarterfinals, Williams beat Netherton 6-4, 6-4 and took down Fort Walton’s Emily Daldine 6-3, 6-2.

Chiles’ girls, meanwhile, captured their fifth consecutive district championship. In addition to Wilson reaching the No. 1 finals, the Timberwolves picked up big points from No. 2 singles winner Sofia Guerrero, No. 3 Amy Xia, and both No. 1 and No. 2 doubles.

The Timberwolves now begin their quest to reach a fourth consecutive state tournament.

“Our 1-2-3 are really strong and we knew we’d ride them,” Chiles head coach Mike Dross said. “While Harli’s loss was tough, it wasn’t a big deal. But she’s a really good doubles player and she did well with Amy there. My biggest takeaway was our players had no signs of quit. They fought the whole way and that’s what we’ve done all year.

“The way we’re playing now, I wouldn’t say we’re on cruise control, but I’m confident we can make it to state again as long as everyone stays in their lane and plays their role.”

756,Local mom battling cancer posts Facebook plea for breast milk,"Local mom battling cancer posts Facebook plea for breast milk Video

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) - Jessica Purcell is one tough mama.

She's a captain in the United States Army. She's served overseas on mutiple deployments in places like Afghanistan and Qatar.

She's faced dangerous situations before.

But, it was her battle here at home with breast cancer where she found herself fighting for her life and the life of her newborn son.

""I just knew ultimately, this is God's will, God's way. Somehow, some way, it will, we can do this,"" she said, cradling her 5-week-old baby boy.

He is her miracle.

When Jessica was nine weeks pregnant, doctors gave her devastating news.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer.

For this St.Petersburg mom who served in the military, perserverance and positivity became her ammo in battling the disease.

""We got this, somehow it's going to work out,"" she said with a sigh and a smile. ""Just keep the faith. Keep your hope. It's so mental.""

Jessica would need that mental strength and toughness as she endured a mastectomy and 12 rounds of grueling chemotherapy, all while pregnant.

At the same time, she and her husband were also raising their little girl, nearly 2-years-old.

""Just going through chemo alone is hard, being pregnant is hard. But, going through both, I just, you would never imagine doing that,"" she told us.

She explained how terrfiying it was to face chemotherapy while carrying her son. She says she sought multiple opinions from top oncologists all over the country and coupled their findings with extensive research she performed on her own.

She says she was told if she didn't seek chemotherapy treatment, she would most likely not survive to see her son or raise her daughter.

She recalled the fear and cripipling anxiety she felt wondering what her future held.

Jessica relied on her faith, friends, familly and support groups comprised of other moms going through similar circumstances

Then, came the joyous moment.

She gave birth to a healthy baby boy in March.

But, because she couldn't breast feed, Jessica wanted to give her little guy a boost to his immune system.

A jump-start for baby Jameson.

So, she posted a plea on Facebook for breast milk.

""I'm like, 'oh my goodness,'"" Jessica told us with a wide grin. ""This is, you know I mean. I have offers coming from around the world now, just to ship from other countires. I literally thought just the girls in St. Pete, maybe Tampa, would be a stretch.""

The mother of two says she's still in shock that her goal went global.

For now, she's focusing on feeding her son with donated breast milk from local moms and familiar faces. She says some moms have paid for extensive bloodwork when offering their milk, while others are close friends in which she has a history.

""It's wonderful, it's overwhelming. My freezer is full, I can actually feed my little guy,"" she said.

Jessica says she's pleasantly overhwhelmed with the love and support she's received worldwide.

It has warmed her heart and strengthened her mama bear spirit.

""I'm more excited than anything, I'm just so blessed,"" she told us. ""My little guy, he's here, just a breath of fresh air.""

Jessica has more final chemo treatment, then will soon begin radiation. She says her nurses at Moffitt Cancer Center keep her going, as does her moms' group.

""They're angels to me!""",http://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/local-mom-battling-cancer-posts-facebook-plea-for-breast-milk/1937701030,2019-04-19T03:28:58Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

A Kansas high school student says that she told she could not join in on a Ferris wheel ride during a school trip because she has Down syndrome.Kathryn Embry, 18, told WDAF she was discriminated against during a class trip to Scheels in Overland Park.Friends Emily Kramer and Morgan McGruder were stunned that Embry was turned away from the ride. They became friends through the girls' Blue Valley North soccer team,“She’s our manager, and she keeps the team in line,"" Kramer said. Kramer and McGruder decided to record a video of Embry explaining the situation and post it to Twitter, where it was retweeted hundreds of times.“I tried to go on the Ferris wheel, but they said I can’t because I have disabilities so I cannot ride,"" Kathryn said in the video. Embry's mother was disappointed to hear about the incident and got in touch with the Scheels manager.“The store manager at the time said he hadn’t heard about the incident, but he could confirm they had a policy that everybody needs to be able to understand and follow the rules,"" her mother Karen Embry said.Karen Embry argues that no one ever asked Kathryn if she understood the rules.""The thing is, Kathryn has Down syndrome, so you can look at her and see that she has a disability,"" Karen Embry said. ""But it says nothing about what her capabilities are. She can read the rules. She can follow the rules.”Kathryn was eventually allowed to ride the Ferris wheel with an adult chaperone, even though she is 18. “It made me really upset because I know that Kathryn is an amazing girl,"" McGruder said. “Just because someone might look different than someone else you shouldn’t assume their capabilities. Kathryn can do anything we can do.""Ultimately, her supporters said it’s not about the ride.“It’s more than just the Ferris wheel,"" Kramer said. ""It’s the fact that they looked at her and discriminated against her because of how she looked. She is our good luck charm, so we had to help fight back for her.”Karen Embry said the family would appreciate an apology and a change of policy. “We’re not here about a boycott and shut down a business that’s been very generous in our community,"" a statement said. ""We’re about educating -- not just the community at large, but business -- about how even if it’s unintentional, it’s still illegal and it’s still wrong because it perpetuates stereotypes and it hurts a population, especially who are hitting this young adult stage.”The Blue Valley School District said in a written statement:“We are proud that Blue Valley employees have the best interests of our students at heart. The physical and emotional well-being of our students is always a top priority. We appreciate the efforts of our community partners to keep our kids safe through equitable practices.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/teen-with-down-syndrome-told-she-can-t-ride-ferris-wheel-because-of-her-disabilities/27190765,2019-04-18T14:17:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
763,#MeToo Movement founder Tarana Burke to speak at FAMU Friday,"CLOSE Tarana Burke, founder of #MeToo movement, spoke at SUNY Broome Tuesday evening. Maggie Gilroy / Staff video

Tarana Burke believes in a world without sexual violence.

Burke is the woman who coined the term “me too” to let sexual violence victims, especially women and girls of color, know they’re not alone.

On Friday, Burke will speak at Florida A&M University as part of a tour at historic black colleges and universities.

After allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein in October 2017, #MeToo became viral. Since then, the term has forged conversations about the silence and suffering of sexual violence survivors, and the powerful positions their perpetrators held.

Survivors are talking, listening and sharing. But Burke said there’s more work to be done.

“A big part of advocacy work and organizing work is imagination,” she said. “We have to imagine a world without sexual violence and the way that we actively move toward that is by shifting the culture that exists now that allows for sexual violence to flourish.”

At the last Sundance Film Festival, Burke coordinated a series of PSAs about sexual harassment.

She said a key to addressing the issue is through ""systemic"" campaigns, like anti-smoking campaigns, as well as comprehensive sexual education for youth to help them understand boundaries and consent to raise ""a new generation of young people to understand that this is not OK.""

Overall, Burke said, battling sexual violence has to be done through ""healing and action.""

""It’s multifaceted,"" she said. ""We have to re-socialize ourselves, we have to socialize our children … we have to insert ourselves in pop culture in order to shift the dominant narrative around sexual violence.""

The phrase ""me too"" came to her in 1997, when she was a summer camp counselor and a girl told her about how she'd been abused by a relative.

""I watched her walk away from me as she tried to recapture her secrets and tuck them back into their hiding place. I watched her put her mask back on and go back into the world like she was all alone and I couldn’t even bring myself to whisper … me too,"" Burke wrote on the Me Too movement's website.

A decade later, in 2006, Burke started Just Be., Inc, an organization to promote the well-being of young women of color.

""Sexual violence doesn’t discriminate. But ... statistics will show you there are fewer resources in communities of color, black communities,"" Burke said.

Since then, she's continued her efforts through the Me Too movement, putting together training for people to start ""community healing circles"" in their cities, giving TED talks and other speeches about the issue.

Once, on a flight out of Pittsburgh, Burke was sitting next to an 83-year-old woman who gave her a hug and said, ""me too."" The woman told Burke that she was abused as a child, but hushed the experience for her whole life.

""I never thought I’d be able to say anything out loud. But thank you for giving me that opportunity before I die to get it off of me,"" Burke recalled her saying.

""We have a lot of work to do,"" Burke added,"" and it’s going to be hard work and it’s going to be heart work.""

764,Mom demands children give their Build-A-Bears to daughter at birthday party,"- This is un-bear-able.

A mom was shocked by an unusual incident that allegedly unfolded at a child’s birthday party and turned to Reddit for advice.

The anonymous poster claimed on Reddit’s Parenting forum that she took her 6-year-old daughter to a classmate’s birthday party at Build-A-Bear Workshop over the weekend.

“The invitation said each kid (about 8 total) would get to make a Bear, and I just assumed they would get to take them home, since that is what happened at another BAB party I went to. Me and my husband even pitched in about 30 dollars as we know these things can get expensive,” the poster wrote on Reddit.

After the children spent time making their special animals and picking accessories, the group left the store and planned to go back to the birthday girl’s house for the rest of the party. However, as the kids left the workshop, the mom of the birthday girl announced each child would have to turn over their animal.

“All is well, we leave the store, then friends mom announces that the kids need to give all their animals to her daughter. Cue the upset and angry kids. They all disappointingly handed over their animals, and friend wasn’t even being nice about it either. Another little boy didn’t want to, and friend ripped it out of his hands. I probably should have said something, but I didn’t. The other parents seemed pretty baffled too,” she wrote.

The mom said she went to the party, but her daughter became upset watching as the birthday girl played with all her new animals.

After she returned home, the mom turned to Reddit asking if “this is totally normal and I should have expected this, or am I being an entitled parent?”

Those on Reddit were quick to respond, defending the mom as not being entitled.

“That is really weird!! I can't believe the parents made all the kids give away their bears,” one person commented.

“Agreed. Beyond strange. I would never in a million years think to have a party where the kids (and our guests) have to give away their item. So bizarre,” another wrote.

“Their daughter and family will forever be remembered for this. And NOT fondly,” another pointed out, concerned the birthday girl will now be disliked by her peers.

Though some tried to reason that maybe the parent throwing the party thought the bears would be gifts — but those attending the party should have been told in the invitation.

“I think it would have been less weird if they had said that up front like ‘Oh she wants a bear specially thought out by each of her friend’ to make it seem like they'll be special or something lol,” one person wrote.

In an update, the original poster explained that she talked to the mom of the party at the school pickup, but did not get a satisfying explanation.

The mom said she asked the mom throwing the party “why the kids didn’t get to keep their bears,” noting she “even pitched in a little bit of money, assuming the bears would go to the kids.

To which the mom allegedly responded, “Well I didn’t have enough money for each of the guests to make their own, that would get pretty expensive! If you want your money back I’ll see about getting it back to you. I don’t really see the problem though.”

Though the mom who wrote the post said she didn’t “push” the topic, she was frustrated that the mom didn’t “have enough money for all the kids” to get a bear, but had “enough [money] for her daughter to get like 8 bears.”

765,Former foster child testifies in sex abuse trial,"Man is accused of committing acts on girl who was 3 at the time

SARASOTA — Wearing a pink dress and braided hair, a young girl took the witness stand Tuesday and spoke in low, mumbling tones.

With her golden retriever therapy dog watching from the audience, the child repeated what she had told police investigators a year earlier — that her former foster father had approached her in a bedroom and put “his pee-pee” in her mouth.

Her testimony — spoken haltingly and quietly in a breathless circuit courtroom — is central to the case that the state is building against 64-year-old Gilberto Rios, a longtime foster father in North Port who is charged with sexual battery against the then-3-year-old girl.

In his defense, attorneys representing Rios used their opening arguments to ask the four-woman, four-man jury to keep in mind that Rios and his wife, Nereida, fostered hundreds of children over the past 25 years in Pennsylvania and Florida.

Attorney Jeffrey Young promised that caseworkers and other state employees would testify they were a “wonderful foster family.”

“Everybody seemed to be happy, they were caring for the children, they would get them to school, to doctor’s appointments, to Disney World,” Young said. “There’s no witnesses, nobody who said they saw anything; there’s no physical evidence.”

But the accusations for which Rios is being tried are not the first to surface.

In an article Tuesday, GateHouse Media detailed suspicions voiced by two parents and a former case manager that four more children were allegedly abused by Rios. One mother said she told the Department of Children & Families in 2016 that both of her daughters had been molested. But DCF could not substantiate her claims and continued placing children with Rios and his wife.

Tuesday afternoon, as the first witnesses took the stand, DCF announced it would review its policy on placing children with foster parents previously accused of abuse, even if unconfirmed.

“I, and all the employees of DCF, are appalled by the allegations in this case,” DCF Secretary Chad Poppell said in a statement Tuesday. “A foster care placement should be a safe place where we would be comfortable sending our own children.”

Rios, who appeared in a black suit jacket with a small oxygen tank, did not speak on the first day of his trial.

The investigation into his alleged abuse was triggered in 2018, when the now 7-year-old’s adoptive mother overheard her tell her older sister that she had once “bit” a man’s penis.

When questioned further, her daughter “shut down,” the mother testified. Three days later, on their way to therapy, the girl disclosed that the man in question was Rios. The mother called the abuse hotline the next day.

“She was placed there for safety and security, but it became a house of horrors,” Assistant State Attorney Brooke Kernan told the jury in her opening arguments.

Prior to the girl’s disclosure, family members also noticed the girl playing with Barbie dolls, stripping them naked, and simulating sex acts with them, according to testimony from the mother and an older sister.

The typically bubbly and cheerful young girl also displayed other worrisome behaviors, according to witnesses.

Guardian ad litem Marca Markwitz testified that while the girl seemed otherwise happy and well-cared for in the Rios home, she also had issues with potty training and smearing feces on the walls.

When Markwitz suggested the child go to therapy, Nereida Rios was resistant.

“I asked her didn’t she think she should see a therapist and Ms. Rios said no, we can handle it,” Markwitz said.

Markwitz also said she rarely, if ever, saw the couple’s two teenage children or their adopted son during visits.

Later in the week, jurors are expected to hear the testimony of a second former foster child who told investigators years earlier that she was also sexually abused by Rios while in his care.

The two children’s placements at the Rios home overlapped, according to testimony from child welfare workers.

Rios’ attorneys moved to block the testimony, raising concerns about inconsistencies in her story. But Judge Charles Roberts overruled their motion on grounds that the second child’s testimony had “striking and significant” similarities.

768,New concern raised in lease of Camp McConnell land,"Winning bid held by former teacher investigated for inappropriate student contact

The man poised to run a 212-acre, year-round children’s camp on land now owned by Alachua County lost a teaching post after being accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a 16-year-old Marion County student, records show.

Jordan A. Richmond, a former West Port High School drama teacher, was investigated and reprimanded by Marion County Public Schools in 2016 after teachers and students raised concerns about his relationship with one of his students, causing him to lose his job.

Now, Richmond is president and founder of the Ocala-based nonprofit Basecamp Ventures and ranked first on the county’s shortlist to acquire Camp McConnell, a 212-acre campground near Micanopy, where the plan is to run a year-round camp with free and discounted services for Alachua County children.

Monday, Richmond denied having an inappropriate relationship with the female student and said all allegations were false.

“There was no findings of any sort,” he said. “Nothing ever happened.”

In February, Richmond’s nonprofit was selected to enter negotiations with the county to buy the camp with an opening bid of $500,000, roughly half what the county originally paid. The next day, The Sun reported the nonprofit had ties to state Sen. Keith Perry, R-Gainesville, who previously threatened to sue the county if he couldn’t purchase the land.

Perry’s ties were not disclosed prior to the selection and caused county officials to reopen the bidding process, worried that the process didn't appear transparent. Basecamp Ventures and Friendship Circle are the two entities vying for the campground, with Richmond’s company ranked as the No. 1 choice by county staff.

County officials are now looking to lease the property for 12 years at $100,000 each year, with an option to purchase after 12 years. The decision for who should run the camp is expected to be made at Thursday’s county commission meeting.

Details of Richmond’s past, however, could derail those plans, or so he fears. County officials said Monday they were unaware of the allegations surrounding Richmond and are investigating the matter.

“These are serious allegations that I’ve forwarded to our county manager and county attorney,” Commissioner Ken Cornell said. “I’ve asked our attorney to make sure that we get Mr. Richmond’s response to this in writing.”

According to a Marion County Public Schools 2016 investigation, witnesses said the 11th grade student and Richmond were often together when others weren’t, sometimes until 8 p.m. at the school or before others arrived in the morning. One teacher told investigators that the two were “very, very close.”

Another student, who worked closely with Richmond, said the female student wore Richmond’s wedding band and that Richmond used Twitter to talk to the girl. One tweet showed a picture of a beach where Richmond said “If only I could take (redaction) there.” The investigation redacted parts of the report that identified the girl. A second student told investigators of seeing the teacher and the girl text each other during class, as well as seeing them spend time in Richmond’s office with the door shut while other students were in the classroom. She was also in his classroom during times she should have been in other classes.

Richmond said he doesn’t wear a wedding ring, though he is married and has with four children, and said the two were rarely alone. He said the student helped him build sets for plays and spent time at rehearsals.

“There were students there all the time,” he said. “... I have been a child-care executive for over 25 years of my career … (The allegations) are based on hearsay and rumors, and nothing ever came of it.”

However, on May 1, 2016, a Sunday night, an Ocala police officer spotted Richmond and the girl, then 17, in a minivan behind an abandoned car dealership along Southwest College Road and State Road 200.

According to the incident report, the van began to drive away after spotting the patrol car but was then pulled over. The girl appeared to be crying and was discussing family issues with Richmond, the report said.

The two told police that they had just left a rehearsal at the school and that the girl texted Richmond to meet and talk in a private location. Richmond said he understood how the meeting appeared, but said he was simply trying to be supportive. He stated twice that he had no illegal intentions with the girl, the report said.

“I did not observe any sexual contact between either party upon initial contact,” the officer wrote in the report.

Richmond told school system investigators that the student requested they meet alone, through the student’s statements disputed that. He also said that he didn’t regret meeting with the student, but made a poor judgment in picking a location.

Investigators concluded Richmond used poor judgment, showed partiality and the confidence of his students, but did not confirm any romantic contact. He was never arrested or criminally charged in connection with the incident or investigation.

The student’s mother, Lisa Calderone, of Citrus County, said she heard from former West Port High School teachers that Richmond was looking to run a camp in Alachua County and thought officials should know about his past.

She wrote commissioners an email Monday morning detailing the relationship between Richmond and her daughter. Richmond said Monday that several of her claims in the email are false.

In a phone interview, Calderone said she didn’t have proof that the two had a sexual relationship and that her daughter wouldn’t talk about it, but that she always suspected it. She said her daughter eventually dropped out of school and moved to Los Angeles to work in adult films and that Richmond is at least partly to blame.

She said she previously tried to involve the police, but that her daughter’s reluctance to speak on the issue left them with little to go on.

“It’s alarming to me that he’d be working with children,” she said. “I’d assume he’d be mentoring these kids. It’s just heart-wrenching.”

Following the school district investigation, Richmond was told he wouldn’t be rehired, though Richmond said he wasn’t told it was because the investigation. He said the district reprimanded him for writing too many hall passes.

A week after being told he wouldn't be rehired, he applied for a job in Lake County and said he had never been investigated for misconduct or had his teaching contract non-renewed.

His response was flagged by the Florida Department of Education.

According to an April 2017 settlement agreement with the state, Richmond was reprimanded again, fined $1,000 and given three years of probation. The state, in a letter Richmond, said it didn't condone his actions and that he lessened the reputation of the profession. His teaching certification expired two months later and hasn’t been renewed.

In 2014, he served as executive director for Camp McConnell for five months, when it was run by the YMCA.

Some of the organizations that vouched for Richmond’s nonprofit in his county proposal include the University of Florida’s departments of sustainability and recreation sports, PACE Center for Girls, Florida Wildlife Care Center, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation, the Gainesville Chamber of Commerce and CDS Family and Behavioral Health Service.

Commissioner Cornell said that Richmond should write letters to each of the organizations that vouched for him, so that they are aware of the allegations.

Richmond said Basecamp Ventures is ready to hit the ground running and he would hate if the allegations derailed that. Some of the services include free swimming lessons, scholarships, weekend retreats working with schools, hiking, having a conference center and leadership education.

“We’ve been doing this for a really long time and this program has the resources, staffing, team and experience,” he said. “We have a true desire and we are committed to Alachua County. We’re doing some tremendous things. This is a blip that didn’t lead to anything.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190415/new-concern-raised-in-lease-of-camp-mcconnell-land?rssfeed=true,2019-04-15T18:03:16Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608

HAINES CITY, Fla. (WFLA) – A man suspected of killing a 6-year-old girl and two other people at a home in Haines City on Friday has turned himself in. Ernst Cherizard, 38, is expected to appear before a judge Monday afternoon.

Cherizard was wanted in connection with the shooting deaths of Elizabelle Frenel, 6, her mother Eli Junia Normil, 23, and Normil's aunt, Nicole Guillume, 48.

When Normil's relatives came to the apartment to check on her, Cherizard told them they were not there. Her aunt, 48-year-old Nicole Guillume, returned to the complex and a confrontation ensued.

774,"Florida parents who didn't know girl was gone for 14 hours charged with neglect, authorities say","The girl, believed to be 2, was found wandering in a park near PBIA on Friday night.

WEST PALM BEACH — Parents of a toddler allegedly said it took 14 hours to realize they had left her at a park. Now the suburban West Palm Beach couple is charged with child neglect and another seven of their children have been pulled from their home, authorities said Sunday.

Makenson Alexandre, 34, was booked Saturday afternoon at the Palm Beach County Jail and left early Sunday morning. Jolanda Larose Alexandre, 27 — her first name also is spelled Yolanda — was booked Saturday afternoon and left a few hours later. Both posted $3,000 bail.

Makensen said at midday Monday that he could not comment now but might later. He declined to give either his daughter's name or age.

According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, the girl, believed to be 2, was found wandering alone just before 8 p.m. Friday at Haverhill Park, on Belvedere Road, west of Palm Beach International Airport. She wore a pink short-sleeve shirt with ""adorable"" on the front, along with a white and gold-colored tutu and clear plastic shoes.

Deputies canvassed the area and reverse 911 calls were made in an effort to find the girl’s parents. The agency sent out a note for media outlets headlined, ""Do you know who I am?""

Late Friday, authorities placed the child with the Florida Department of Children and Families.

At about 11:40 a.m. Saturday, the parents reported their daughter missing. Detectives went to their home in the Stacy Street apartments, near Belvedere and Haverhill, about a half mile north of the park. The parents said they had not realized until then that they didn't have the little girl.

DCF removed the other seven children from the home and the parents were arrested, PBSO said Sunday morning.

According to a sheriff's report, two women walking in the park had come across the child and called authorities. The wife told deputies she'd loaded the children in her SUV, picked up her husband at work and headed to the park, where he let the children play for about an hour. She said when she returned home, she thought she saw the 2-year-old playing outside before she went to sleep.

She said she awoke at about 8:30 a.m. Saturday and soon realized the toddler wasn't there. She said she asked the other children and they said the toddler hadn't slept with them.

She said she and the other children ""began looking frantically for"" the toddler, then called 911. The report said the mother ""was crying and shaking and said she cannot believe that she left (name withheld) in the park. She said this is the first time anything like this has happened and her children have never gone missing before.""

The mother said she usually checks on the children at bedtime but had not done so this time.

The father told investigators he also did not check on the children, either when leaving the park or when returning home about 7:15 p.m. He said he dressed and went to church, then came home around 11 p.m. and went to sleep. He also said he did not check on the children. He said he loaded the children in the SUV on Saturday morning to go back to the park and it wasn't until they nearly were there that he realized the toddler was missing.

779,Edgewater cop suspended after being warned or disciplined 10 times,"Among the allegations made against Officer Andrew Spurlock is that he engaged in intimate contact with a woman in his squad car while on duty on a street corner.

An Edgewater police officer who is dating a city councilwoman will be suspended without pay for 12 days for being late for one work shift and napping during another.

It's just the latest disciplinary action against Officer Andrew Spurlock. All told, he's been disciplined or received a warning 10 times since 2017, records show. Among other things, Spurlock was reprimanded earlier this year following allegations he had intimate contact with a woman in his police vehicle while on duty.

""The Edgewater Police Department follows a progressive discipline model,"" Interim Police Chief Joe Mahoney wrote to The News-Journal in an email Thursday. ""We ensure our officers are accountable for their actions.""

As part of his suspension that begins next week, Spurlock is required to forfeit his badge and gun. He was hired by the Edgewater Police Department in August 2016 and is paid $35,921 annually.

Spurlock denied the accusation he had relations with a woman while in uniform, but the ensuing investigation still resulted in discipline and a loss of 12 hours of personal time off. He lost another 12 hours of personal time off for failing to call in sick for an overtime shift late last year.

Spurlock is dating City Councilwoman Megan O'Keefe.

His most recent mistakes resulted in a harsher punishment. He is not allowed to work or get paid for any of his scheduled shifts from April 22 through May 12, according to the city.

On Feb. 25, Sgt. Sara Pollard reported to Spurlock's supervisor that she caught him sleeping and snoring in his patrol vehicle in front of Boston Whaler when she showed up to relieve him. Spurlock told both his supervisor and the internal affairs investigator that he was ""horsing around"" with Pollard by pretending he was asleep. He was found in violation of two department policies as a result.

On March 11, Spurlock was scheduled to arrive at work at 6 a.m., but didn't show up until 6:50 a.m., according to a report. Spurlock said he was late because he set his alarm to P.M. instead of A.M. That allegation was sustained.

For those two infractions, Spurlock was suspended for a total of 144 work hours.

The one who came forward with three of the allegations against the embattled police officer in late 2018 was the estranged husband of O'Keefe, the city councilwoman who is dating Spurlock.

James O'Keefe's most serious accusation against Spurlock is that he performed a sex act on a woman while on duty and in uniform in his patrol car.

Spurlock was accused of meeting up with the woman one night in February 2018 at the intersection of 22nd Street and Hibiscus Drive. It was learned during the internal affairs investigation that Spurlock spent more than 92 minutes at that location, according to a report.

Spurlock told Soltz he never fondled the woman. Soltz stated in his report that Spurlock told him he parks at the intersection ""a lot"" to do paperwork. In the same report, Spurlock said he had no specific recollection of what he was doing at that street corner on that particular night.

The woman's story about that night differed from Spurlock's. The woman told Lt. Aaron Soltz, the internal affairs investigator, that she was with Spurlock. At one point, she had her back to him while he was seated in his car with his legs turned outward, the report stated. She also said she was standing between Spurlock's legs. That's when the officer slid his hand down the front of her pants and fondled her, according to the report.

James O'Keefe received Facebook messages from someone describing how Spurlock and the woman met, as well as ""sexual encounters they had on and off duty,"" the report stated.

O'Keefe told his estranged wife about Spurlock's relationship with the other woman and she was later interviewed by Soltz. Megan O'Keefe told Soltz that Spurlock initially lied to her about the encounters he had with the woman, but he later admitted it, according to the report. O'Keefe said Spurlock told her their encounters occurred while he was off duty, Soltz stated.

Spurlock met the 44-year-old Edgewater woman during a traffic crash investigation. The two exchanged phone calls and met up several times, Soltz wrote. At one point, while Spurlock was at the woman's house, he played a prank on her teenage niece. He had the teen blow into a device and Spurlock told her she tested positive for ""weed in her system,"" Soltz wrote in his report. Spurlock pulled out a pair of handcuffs, which caused the girl to get scared and cry, the report stated.

Spurlock contradicted some of those details, telling Soltz he showed the girl the handcuffs after she asked to see them and that she never cried, according to a summary of the investigation.

The allegation sustained against Spurlock was that he violated the officer's Code of Conduct by being inattentive to his duties. The allegation that his professional conduct was detrimental to the morale and reputation of the department was not sustained.

Megan O'Keefe was arrested in September 2018 on a domestic battery charge following allegations she scratched and struck her husband during an argument. The argument was over O'Keefe allegedly seeing someone else, according to an arrest report.

The State Attorney's Office decided not to prosecute the councilwoman.

James O'Keefe came forward two other times with complaints against Spurlock in late 2018. O'Keefe's attorney emailed then-Edgewater police chief David Acieri alleging that Spurlock ""inflamed an already volatile situation"" involving O'Keefe and his ex-wife.

O'Keefe said he was at his estranged wife's home the night of Sept. 29, 2018 with a police officer. He was there removing property from the house, which he had previously shared with his wife.

While he was at the house, Megan O'Keefe showed up. James O'Keefe accused Spurlock of notifying her about his presence there. This came two weeks or so after Megan O'Keefe's domestic battery arrest.

Spurlock and Megan O'Keefe denied the accusation that Spurlock tipped her off about her estranged husband being at her house. He was cleared of that allegation.

In November 2018, James O'Keefe also filed a complaint alleging Spurlock had interfered with a Florida Department of Children and Families investigation involving him and his estranged wife. The investigation revealed that Spurlock asked the DCF agent whether a case was ongoing, but didn't pressure her to disclose anything sensitive. That allegation also was unfounded.

A fourth internal affairs investigation resulted in a sustained allegation against Spurlock, one that didn't involve James O'Keefe. Soltz concluded Spurlock had failed to notify his supervisor that he was too sick to work an overtime shift in November.

785,"After Beyoncé surprise album, Netflix 'Homecoming' documentary may feature familiar FAMU faces","Before the much-anticipated Netflix documentary, “Homecoming: A Film By Beyoncé” was scheduled to start streaming at 3:01 a.m. Wednesday, Don P. Roberts wasn’t quite sure what to expect.

The Queen Bey dropped a surprise 40-track album Wednesday to accompany the documentary, wowing the world and her faithful Beehive of fans.

But the former Marching 100 drum major — chosen by the star’s team to help bring the authentic HBCU culture to her 2018 Coachella concert upon which the film is based — expects it to include glimpses of faces familiar to Florida A&M University alumni.

In a nod to the pop culture icon’s international status – and the total control she commands over her empire — Netflix remained mum on any advance details.

Earlier this month, it did release a trailer, a fast-moving tease of some of the scenes.

Included was snapshot of men wearing FAMU T-shirts, which already has made its way around social media.

USA Today reported it gives “glimpses at Queen Bey and her team's preparation for the performance, set to the words of Maya Angelou.”

""I want to be representative of my race: the human race,"" the late poet and activist can be heard saying. ""I have a chance to show how kind we can be, how intelligent and generous we can be. I have a chance to teach and to love and to laugh. I know that when I finish doing what I'm sent here to do, I will be called home, and I will go home without any fear (or) trepidations wondering what's going to happen.""

Special premier viewings were held Tuesday night at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and Texas Southern University in the star’s hometown of Houston.

Netflix's 'Homecoming' documentary has FAMU ties

The two-hour-plus film captures a behind-the-scenes look at Beyoncé’s groundbreaking 2018 performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.

In it, she exposed the world to homecoming culture at HBCUs, complete with dancers, a nod to Greek life, marching bands and drumlines.

Beyoncé’s affinity for HBCUs stems from her father, who graduated from Fisk University, a private HBCU in Nashville, Tennessee.

The Florida A&M influence was propelled when Beyoncé’s team requested the assistance of Roberts, a FAMU alum and former Marching 100 drum major, who is recognized as one of the country’s most respected music educators.

Roberts attended FAMU from 1980 to 1985, earning his degree in music education. One of his classmates was Shelby Chipman, current professor of music and director of marching and pep bands at the university.

Based in Atlanta, Roberts is CEO of DRUMLine Live, music supervisor for DeKalb County Schools and former band director at Southwest DeKalb High School.

Roberts gained national recognition as executive band consultant for the movie “Drumline,” where he was in charge of working with actors, creating the precision drills and more.

He also served as band consultant for the BET series “The Quad” which which was set on a fictitious black university campus in Atlanta.

DRUMLine Live is an international tour production, including alumni from Florida A&M, Tennessee State, Alabama State and other HBCUs.

Among its members are former FAMU musicians and dancers with campus troupes. Former Marching 100 drum major Slater Thorpe, serves as its show announcer, the same role he snagged for Beyoncé’s Coachella performance.

It was Roberts who was sought after by Beyoncé’s team to help bring the HBCU experience to her Coachella production.

“None of us had a role in the 'Homecoming' Netflix special,” Roberts said. “However, I'm sure you will see most of them in the special.”

Roberts said DRUMLine Live was responsible for securing HBCU-experienced band members to blend in with the group already established by Beyoncé’s team for her performance at Coachella.

“Her musicians were incredible and so were the members of DRUMLine Live,” Roberts said. “They made an extraordinary team that made musical history together. We were not responsible for the steppers and dancers. I selected all members from DRUMLine Live and assisted her musical director with rehearsals. I think our greatest role was bringing true HBCU authenticity to Coachella.”

That was critical, Robert said.

“Going into the project, my biggest concern was being authentic to the HBCU culture,” he said. “I know the Beehive was tough, but I knew if we did not properly pay tribute to the HBCU culture, inclusive of marching band, sororities, and fraternities, we were gonna have to deal with the wrath and scorn of HBCU band heads and alumni worldwide.”

Fortune magazine reported Beyoncé — the first black woman to headline at Coachella — broke viewership records on YouTube, with her HBCU-themed set attracting 458,000 simultaneous global viewers at its peak, making it the most viewed Coachella performance ever.

Her performance included over 100 singers, dancers, and musicians.

“I applaud the Queen and her staff for taking such a huge risk, but also for flawlessly executing what some may have thought was an impossible task,” Roberts said. “She is now a part of HBCU music history forever. I think her impact will be felt in the future by the positive exposure it will bring to the HBCU culture.”

786,"Jonchuck found guilty of murder, sentenced to life","CLEARWATER — A Florida jury on Tuesday found a man guilty of first-degree murder for dropping his 5-year-old daughter off a bridge four years ago, despite arguments from his attorneys that he was insane and thought his actions would actually save her. He was automatically sentenced to life in prison.

Jurors in Clearwater, deliberated for about seven hours over two days before convicting John Jonchuck, whom prosecutors portrayed as a vengeful man who planned to kill his daughter to keep her away from her mother and grandmother.

The Tampa Bay Times reported that no one from Jonchuck's family was in the courtroom when the verdict was announced. And no friends or relatives spoke on behalf of Phoebe or her father before the sentencing. Jonchuck, who was stoic when the verdict was read, hugged his attorneys and said, ""Yes, your honor,"" when asked if he understood that the verdict carries an automatic life sentence. He was then fingerprinted and taken out of the courtroom by bailiffs.

Jonchuck's lawyers had asked the judge to delay sentencing for a week because they have some issues to check. But when they failed to provide a reason, Judge Chris Helinger proceeded with the sentencing.

""I am satisfied that justice was done,"" the newspaper quoted Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney Bernie McCabe as saying. ""My immediate reaction is killing children doesn't make one a very sympathetic character.""

The judge thanked jurors for their attention during the month-long trial. ""There's no way I can express my appreciation for your service,"" she said. ""I've never had a trial this long and I've been here about 12 years as a judge.""

No one disputed that Jonchuck, now 29, dropped his daughter Phoebe 62 feet into Tampa Bay in January 2015, and that he had a long history of mental problems.

But prosecutors claimed his action was premeditated. Assistant state attorney Paul Bolan told jurors that Jonchuck was motivated by anger over worries that Phoebe's mother was going to take the girl away from him and his own mother's doting attention to her granddaughter when she had been inattentive to him growing up.

""It was rage that drove him to it on top of that bridge,"" Bolan said. ""Did he know what he was doing, and did he know it was wrong? The answer is clearly yes.""

But assistant public defender Jessica Manuele told jurors Jonchuck loved Phoebe more than anything else in the world and that there's no evidence he acted out of ""unbridled anger.""

His delusions led him to believe Phoebe was possessed and that the archangel, Michael, was coming, Manuele said. He poured salt outside her window to keep spirits away, she said.

At the moment he threw her off the bridge, ""he thought he was protecting his daughter,"" Manuele said. ""It will never make sense because it's insanity.""

Twelve hours before Phoebe's death, Jonchuck's divorce lawyer, Genevieve Torres, called a state child protection hotline, fearing for the girl's safety, authorities said.

Torres told the Department of Children and Families operator that Jonchuck had driven to three churches in his pajamas with Phoebe in tow that morning, called Torres ""God"" and asked her to translate his stepmother's century-old Swedish Bible, which he carried and had become obsessed with. Jonchuck was also paranoid that Phoebe wasn't his child, Torres said.

But the operator thought the attorney was more worried about Jonchuck's safety than the girl's and did not report the call to authorities, they said.

Just after midnight the next day, Jonchuck's PT Cruiser raced past officer William Vickers, who was heading home from a shift in his patrol car. He started following Jonchuck, but never got close enough to read the license plate and didn't know Phoebe was inside, authorities have said.

As they reached the bridge's crest, Jonchuck stopped and got out. Vickers, fearing an ambush, stopped behind him, pulled his gun and yelled at Jonchuck to show his hands. He saw no weapon.

Jonchuck yelled at the officer, ""You have no free will."" He grabbed Phoebe from the back seat, held her over the side momentarily and then dropped her, according to police accounts.

Jonchuck drove off but was soon arrested. Vickers scrambled down a ladder to a dock below the bridge but couldn't see Phoebe in the dark water. A marine rescue boat was summoned, and her body was found hours later.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190416/jonchuck-found-guilty-of-murder-sentenced-to-life?rssfeed=true,2019-04-16T18:40:15Z,The Ledger,Couple,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815
787,"'Stay with me, stay with me:' 911 calls released in Palm Coast teen's death","FLAGLER COUNTY, Fla. - Calls placed to 911 moments after a Palm Coast teen was fatally shot were released Tuesday along with a push from the Flagler County Sheriff's Office for additional witnesses to the crime to come forward.

A friend of 18-year-old Curtis Israel Gray called 911 along with a witness who stepped outside and saw the teen bleeding in the parking lot of Palm Coast Laundry around 12:30 a.m. Saturday.

""My friend just got shot,"" Gray's friend said.

The friend said Gray was shot in the chest and was trying to stay conscious.

The other witness who called 911 told an operator that there was no exit wound on Gray's back.

""Stay with me, stay with me,"" someone can be heard telling Gray during that 911 call.

The friend said a man named Frank who lives in the P Section of Palm Coast was responsible for the shooting. He said that man fled in a dark-colored SUV with three other people in it.

""I don't know his last name, but I know it's a girl driving the truck, it's a white dude in the front and there's two other people in the back,"" the friend said.

Deputies said 17-year-old Marion Lee Gavins was arrested Sunday after he turned himself in to authorities. He's facing a first-degree murder charge.

Though an arrest has been made in connection with Gray's death, deputies said they are still seeking additional witnesses to the crime as well as investigating witness tampering claims after reports of threats of retaliation to those who are cooperating with law enforcement.

“Learn from the mistakes of others that violence is not going to solve your problems,” Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly said. “Don’t let another life be ruined or lost to senseless violence.”

Deputies said anyone who threatens a witness could face charges.

Teresa Selgado, also known as Alex, is being sought in connection with the case, but she is not considered a suspect.

Anyone with information about the shooting or potential witness tampering is asked to call FCSO at 386-313-4911 or email TIPS@flaglersheriff.com.

A GoFundMe account has been established to help pay for Gray's funeral expenses.

788,North Port foster dad accused of sexual abuse stands trial today,"Gilberto Rios and his wife have fostered 48 children since 2009

SARASOTA — A 64-year-old North Port foster parent stands trial today for the alleged sexual and physical abuse of a 3-year-old girl back in 2015.

Last year, the child reportedly told her adoptive mother that Gilberto Rios forced his penis into her mouth, triggering a police investigation.

In an interview with investigators in April 2018, the girl said Rios “took my hand and pulled me over there,” unzipped his pants, then told her to put her mouth on his penis, according to a transcript obtained from court files related to the case.

Afterwards, she ran to her room and locked the door, the child told investigators.

Rios, who has pleaded not guilty and opted for trial, has fostered 48 children with his wife since they became licensed foster parents in 2009, according to child welfare officials.

His wife, Nereida, has not been charged.

But the allegations of sexual and physical abuse are not the first to be made against the Rios family.

GateHouse Media has identified at least four more suspected victims through public records and court documents. None are being named to protect their privacy.

In 2016, a biological mother complained to the Department of Children & Families that her two daughters had been sexually and physically abused while in the couple's care. But DCF could not substantiate the complaint and continued to send vulnerable foster children to the couple for more than a year.

Then in 2018, suspicions of abuse surfaced again with regard to a young child whom Rios and his wife adopted. The boy began disclosing disturbing stories to caseworkers after his father’s arrest last year, according to a former case manager for the Safe Children Coalition.

And Monday, the adoptive mother of yet another child previously fostered by the Rios family said she also fears her daughter was sexually abused.

The Sarasota YMCA/Safe Children Coalition, the nonprofit agency contracted by the Department of Children and Families to manage the child welfare system in Sarasota County, did not answer questions about how many abuse allegations have been filed against Rios over the years or why he and his wife were allowed to continue fostering after the initial allegations were made in 2016.

In an email, Steve Hurwitz, the attorney for the agency, said simply that DCF handles child abuse investigations in Sarasota County.

He added that the Rios foster home was “closed” the day Rios was arrested in April 2018.

The Florida Department of Children and Families did not return multiple requests for comment.

Gilberto Rios’ defense attorney Jeffrey Young also declined to comment on the case Friday.

But before jury selection on Monday, he and fellow defense attorney Betsy Young argued that allegations by children, especially those who have been through other trauma, are susceptible to false memories and embellishment through repeated questioning.

A database of foster care placements obtained by GateHouse Media shows that Rios and his wife often fostered five or six children at a time and were licensed to accept traditional foster kids under the age of 5 as well as medically needy foster children. The records also show that the couple was paid an average of $1,512 per month from 2013 through 2017 for foster services.

The database may be closed to the public next year because of a bill making its way through the Florida Legislature that would make the names of all foster parents a secret.

DCF worked with legislators to craft the proposal after GateHouse Media and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune made a public records request last year asking for the names of all licensed foster parents in the state.

Rios will now stand trial in Sarasota County Circuit Court following an investigation that began in April 2018. That’s when the adoptive mother of one of his former foster children noticed the girl simulating oral sex with Barbie dolls.

When questioned, the girl said that she had once “bit” someone’s penis, according to court documents. Later, on her way to a therapy appointment, she revealed that person was Rios, police in North Port said.

According to police, the girl’s adoptive mother immediately reported the allegations to authorities, who interviewed the child on April 12, 2018.

Police arrested Rios later that night and charged him with sexual assault against a child. He bonded out on $200,000 the next day, court records show.

During the course of the investigation, North Port Police Department detective Shannon Fortuno also learned of a previous allegation made against Rios in 2016. Fortuno noted in court documents that investigators conducted a medical exam in that case, but did not conduct a forensic interview, “possibly due to the age of the child.”

In an interview Friday, the mother of that child said she believes both of her daughters — then 2 and 3 — were molested by Rios.

She started to suspect abuse after noticing her daughters showing up for visits with cuts and bruises on their lips and buttocks. Her 3-year-old later began bleeding from her vagina and developed a yeast infection, according to the mother, whose name is being withheld to protect her children’s identities.

When asked about the injuries, her daughter “said she couldn’t tell me because she would go to jail or not be able to go home to Mommy,” the mother said.

She added that child welfare officials ignored her requests to have her daughter forensically interviewed to determine the veracity of her statements.

“Everybody kept getting ignored,” she said. “Emails, calls — it was ignored.”

After Hurricane Irma, she moved her and her daughters out of the state.

“My (daughter) is not even potty trained because she’s terrified of the toilet from when she was dunked into the toilet by Mr. and Mrs. Rios,” she said. “If I try to cut (my daughter) an apple, she screams out, please don’t cut the baby.”

Since she made her report, child welfare officials in Sarasota placed at least 10 foster children with the Rios family, according to the database obtained by GateHouse.

A former case manager with the Safe Children Coalition who asked that her name be withheld because of fears of retribution said the state’s investigation into the alleged abuse was inconclusive.

Despite the uncertainty, she said officials often continue to send children to homes with previous abuse allegations because of the severe shortage of available foster homes.

“There’s been foster homes which were less than stellar that we’ve had concerns about and they keep using them because, ‘Oh, well, they take the hard kids,'"" she said.

The former case manager said that’s also when concerns cropped up about the couple’s adopted son, who began disclosing stories to caseworkers about “how he would go to Daddy’s room and they would have candy and have special time together,” she said.

“We had serious concerns that the mother was grooming the child.”

But legal efforts to temporarily remove the adoptive son from the home were turned down by Judge Rochelle Curley last year, according to two sources familiar with the case. It is unknown whether the child remains in the home.

Other people who took in children previously fostered by Rios also expressed concerns, including one mother who adopted her daughter out of the system in 2017.

After more than two decades as a foster parent, specializing in children with medical needs, she said it was the worst case she’d ever seen. The 2-year-old girl could not walk, talk or eat on her own. She looked as if she’d never seen the sun. The child was underweight and vomited profusely.

The mother, whom GateHouse is not naming to protect her child’s identity, feared her daughter had been abused.

“She was just so terrified of public restrooms, our bathroom, any bathroom,” the mother said. “You could see the sheer terror in her eyes.”

She said it took years for the child to gain trust in her as a mother. During bath time, the little girl would cover her privates, and scream “please, Mommy, no.”

“I had to tell her 100 times a day, I will never hurt you,” she said. “I don’t know by whom, but I can guarantee you, that child was abused.”

The adoptive mother was surprised to learn from GateHouse Media reporters that her daughter spent six months under Rios’ care as an infant in 2015, before later spending time with at least four other temporary caregivers.

The state never contacted her about the allegations against Rios.

“They don’t do the responsible thing,” she said. “It’s all supposed to be what’s in the best interest of the child. But it’s not. It’s what’s in the best interest of the agency.”

789,Foster dad accused of sexually abusing a toddler stands trial today,"SARASOTA — A 64-year-old North Port foster parent stands trial today for the alleged sexual and physical abuse of a 3-year-old girl back in 2015.

Last year, the child reportedly told her adoptive mother that Gilberto Rios forced his penis into her mouth, triggering a police investigation.

In an interview with investigators in April 2018, the girl said Rios “took my hand and pulled me over there,” unzipped his pants, then told her to put her mouth on his penis, according to a transcript obtained from court files related to the case.

Afterwards, she ran to her room and locked the door, the child told investigators.

Rios, who has pleaded not guilty and opted for trial, has fostered 48 children with his wife since they became licensed foster parents in 2009, according to child welfare officials.

His wife, Nereida, has not been charged.

But the allegations of sexual and physical abuse are not the first to be made against the Rios family.

GateHouse Media has identified at least four more suspected victims through public records and court documents. None are being named to protect their privacy.

In 2016, a biological mother complained to the Department of Children & Families that her two daughters had been sexually and physically abused while in the couple's care. But DCF could not substantiate the complaint and continued to send vulnerable foster children to the couple for more than a year.

Then in 2018, suspicions of abuse surfaced again with regard to a young child whom Rios and his wife adopted. The boy began disclosing disturbing stories to caseworkers after his father’s arrest last year, according to a former case manager for the Safe Children Coalition.

And Monday, the adoptive mother of yet another child previously fostered by the Rios family said she also fears her daughter was sexually abused.

The Sarasota YMCA/Safe Children Coalition, the nonprofit agency contracted by the Department of Children and Families to manage the child welfare system in Sarasota County, did not answer questions about how many abuse allegations have been filed against Rios over the years or why he and his wife were allowed to continue fostering after the initial allegations were made in 2016.

In an email, Steve Hurwitz, the attorney for the agency, said simply that DCF handles child abuse investigations in Sarasota County.

He added that the Rios foster home was “closed” the day Rios was arrested in April 2018.

The Florida Department of Children and Families did not return multiple requests for comment.

Gilberto Rios’ defense attorney Jeffrey Young also declined to comment on the case Friday.

But before jury selection on Monday, he and fellow defense attorney Betsy Young argued that allegations by children, especially those who have been through other trauma, are susceptible to false memories and embellishment through repeated questioning.

A database of foster care placements obtained by GateHouse Media shows that Rios and his wife often fostered five or six children at a time and were licensed to accept traditional foster kids under the age of 5 as well as medically needy foster children. The records also show that the couple was paid an average of $1,512 per month from 2013 through 2017 for foster services.

790,'I didn't do any of this:' Man accused of killing family denies role in shooting,"SEMINOLE COUNTY, Fla. - Even when he was confronting with photos of his dead mother, father and brother, a triple murder suspect continued to deny shooting his family members at their Chuluota home.

Video evidence released Monday shows investigators interviewed Grant Amato for four hours and never once in that time did he admit to his role in the crime or express remorse. Instead, Amato, 29, remained calm and never once raised his voice even while adamantly denying the accusations.

Amato is accused of killing his parents Chad Amato, 59, and Margaret Amato, 61, and his brother, Cody Amato, 31, on Jan. 25. Officials say before the slayings, Amato fought with his father because he'd stolen $200,000 from his family and wired it to a Bulgarian cam girl with whom he'd had an online relationship.

In the recorded interview, which took place a day after the deaths, Amato tells investigators that his father was upset that he'd ruined his retirement plans with the theft but that his mother and brother were always the mediators.

[RELATED: Worried co-workers led to slain family's discovery, 911 calls show | Florida man wired $200,000 to Bulgarian 'cam girl' before killing family, deputies say | Chuluota man accused of killing his family denied bond, pleads not guilty ]

When Amato's father found out that he was still involved with the cam girl -- despite the theft, despite his stint in a rehabilitation center meant to treat internet and sex addiction, and despite being told that he would be kicked out of the house if he spoke to her again -- he told Amato he needed to pack his things and move out, according to the video.

""It was everything that he had been telling me for the past months and months and months about how I'd ruined his retirement,"" Amato said.

He claimed that at some point during the argument, his father grabbed him by his collar and also threatened to kill him if he ever returned to the home.

""I had always been passive so I didn't, I didn't fight back or anything like that, I just tried to get my grounding and then we were just standing and, you know, it just continued on,"" Amato said.

Records show Amato said he and his father argued on and off for about three hours while he gathered his belongings to move out of the home.

At some point, Amato claimed his mother stepped in and then later his brother also tried to mediate.

""My dad and my mom were arguing and I was still just packing up all my stuff and then when Cody got home, he started to transgress with my dad and I was just trying to stay out of it,"" Amato said.

Investigators told Amato that evidence disproved Amato's assertions that he left the house before the shooting and that he met with his brother down the street before he returned home.

About three hours into the interview, a detective presents Amato with photos from the murder scene showing his dead mother, father and brother. The video shows as Amato hangs his head, covers his face with his hands and appears to choke back tears.

""Did your father go after you and you tried to protect yourself?"" one detective asks.

""No, I didn't do any of this,"" Amato answers.

From that point forward, detectives continue to push Amato for the truth and confront him with the evidence. They say in the video that no one else entered the home after Amato left, none of the victims had gunshot residue on their hands and that Cody Amato -- who had a close relationship with his brother -- was shot in the head the moment he entered the home.

""This, this and this happened while you were still present in the house and for whatever reason, you don't want to tell us,"" a detective says, pointing to the pictures laid out on the table showing the dead bodies.

The detectives say they can understand if Amato was defending himself against his father since they had a tumultuous relationship but couldn't understand why he'd shoot his mother and brother, who always came to his defense even amid legal and financial troubles.

""I don't have the answer for anything else,"" Amato said.

For the majority of the interview, Amato shows little emotion. The detective points out that he doesn't seem remorseful or as upset as someone should be after losing three family members.

""You don't know what? You don't know if you feel bad for doing this to your family?"" a detective asks.

""I've been getting blamed for the last half a year for everything and I've been trying to move forward into a positive direction and then every day I'm reminded of all the trouble I've caused and then I keep being told the same thing over and over again but there's nothing I can do to change it,"" Amato replies.

The detectives continue to offer Amato opportunities to confess but the four-hour video ends with him still claiming that he doesn't know who would hurt his family.

Amato was taken into custody on Jan. 28.

The video was among dozens of pieces of evidence released to the media on Monday. Also included were autopsy reports that show all three victims were shot in the head, a letter in which he explains his online relationship, photos from the crime scene and recorded interviews with family members.

Amato is facing three counts of first-degree murder. If convicted, he will face the death penalty.

791,Picnic tables project hopes to make Lee County school bus stops safer in wake of two deaths,"A tweet about a project building picnic tables for Lee County school bus stops made its way to Marvin R. Ellison, the CEO of Lowe's Home Improvement over the weekend.

It prompted encouragement from him, and a tripling of the project's output.

The table project, born out of tragedy, initially brought an overwhelming response with the construction of 57 picnic tables — now placed at school bus stops around Lee County. An additional 100 tables are on their way.

Businesses and area residents gathered in North Fort Myers Saturday to help build those tables in four hours. The project was a response to the deadly March 25 hit-and-run crash at a Cape Coral bus stop that killed elementary-school-bound Layla Aiken, 8, and a January 14 hit-and-run in North Fort Myers that killed 12-year-old Alana Tamplin.

Layla was struck as she sat on the edge of the road next to her two brothers. Alana was hit as she walked home from taking her younger sister to a bus stop.

A member of the project tweeted Ellison — ""Hi Marvin in Fort Myers FL we experienced a tragedy. 8 year old girl was killed by a hit and run driver waiting for her bus. We're buying and building benches to put at stops all over our county. We've purchased close to 100 but we need Lowe's help donating more""

""The CEO reached out,"" Kaci Allen, manager at the Lowe's Gladiolus Boulevard store, said. His reach-out helped provide an additional 75 tables that are now nearly done and stored at Allen's store with another 25 in the works.

""Most of the 14 stores in the Southwest Florida district donated materials,"" Allen said. ""The company does a great job with this kind of initiative.""

More tables were donated Monday by Lowe's home improvement stores in the Southwest Florida district. Seventy-five were built and stored at the Gladiolus store and another 25 were to be delivered. (Photo: Michael Braun/news-press.com)

The 75 tables will be taken to school bus stops Saturday with the other 25 the following week. That makes 157 tables produced via the program so far.

Allen said the new tables will have reflective tape and a plaque on each remembering Layla and Alana and a length of chain and a lock will be sent with each table to provide security. Some tables and benches initially placed in the days after Layla's death were stolen.

The picnic table project came out of efforts to make bus stops safer. Some residents bought benches and placed them in their yards.

With the help of Lowe's of Cape Coral and a number of other Lowe's stores from Naples to Tampa, the raw materials for the tables were delivered to the Pine Shadows Airpark property off U.S. 41 with nearly 40 helpers gathering early Saturday to start building.

Spencer Crutchley with Lowe’s of Cape Coral said the company reduced prices and donated several products.

Other businesses contributed as well, Spenser said.

“Iragazzi Pizza was on hand providing lunch, and Kona Ice provided free shaved ice for the volunteers,” he said. ""It was nice volunteering all weekend building the benches. Just the response from the community dropping them off was nice.""

Lowe’s also provided water and Gatorade, and Pure Perfection donated a pallet of water for the volunteers.

As they completed the tables volunteers loaded them on a trailer. Another crew headed out Sunday morning and placed them at school bus stops in Cape Coral, Lehigh Acres and North Fort Myers.

Some of the tables had inscriptions memorializing Layla and Alana.

There are nearly 7,000 school bus stops in Lee County, with 1,671 in Cape Coral.

""It's pretty awesome to see the community come together,"" Allen said.

TAMPA (WFLA) - The parents of a toddler who is fighting stage four cancer are shocked after they said they received a hateful message from a stranger.

Callie June is 18 months old and was diagnosed with advanced neuroblastoma that metastasized to her lymph nodes and bones. She is currently stage 4 and is currently on her 5th round of chemotherapy.

A GoFundMe was created to help supplement the loss in income as Callie's parents Tiffany and Albree Shaffer have stayed by her side in the hospital.

Through all the support, unfortunately, they received one message that was difficult to read.

The message read: “My prayers for Callie. I was going to donate $7600.00 to her fund, but I found out her parents are lesbian. I’ve chosen to donate to St. Jude due to that fact. Sorry. I’ll still pray for her though, but maybe it’s God’s way of getting your attention that she needs a mommy and a daddy, not two mommies.”

Callie's family says in a time like this, Callie needs love and support not hate and misery.

In a recent update on Friday, Callie's parents posted that 98 percent of her tumor is dead.

“So far, so good. It’s been a bumpy road, but she’s for sure kicking butt!”

794,"Haines City Police: Girl, 6, shot at Citrus Ridge has died","The suspect in what now is a triple-murder, Ernst Cherizard, 38, remains at large. A GoFundMe account has been established for the victims.

UPDATE

The Haines City Police Department has announced that 6-year-old shooting victim Elizabelle Frenel died Saturday night.

The little girl, her mother, 23-year-old Eli Junia Normil, and aunt, 48-year-old Nicole Guillume, were all killed in a shooting Friday night at the Citrus Ridge Apartments in Haines City. The suspect in what now is a triple-murder, Ernst Cherizard, 38, remains at large, according to a release from HCPD.

She had been shot three times, including once in the head, by Cherizard. Normil and Guillume were killed by gunshot wounds to the head.

A GoFundMe account has been established for the victims. To visit the page, CLICK HERE.

There have been no further details released on Cherizard's whereabouts, though South Florida law enforcement agencies are on high alert after the 2011 Nissan Altima he fled the shooting scene in was spotted near Boynton Beach via a tag reader at a toll plaza just after midnight early Saturday morning.

If anyone has any information about Cherizard's location, they are asked to contact the Haines City Police Department at 863-421-3636 or Heartland Crime Stoppers at 800-226-8477 (TIPS). If they come in contact with him, immediately call 911. Cherizard is considered armed and dangerous.

ORIGINAL STORY

HAINES CITY — Haines City Police are reporting that a 6-year-old girl who was among three people shot at the Citrus Ridge Apartments on Friday night is considered brain dead.

According to a news release Saturday, Chief James Elensky said the search continues for Ernst Cherizard, 38, who is suspected in the shooting deaths of two women and the girl.

However, a clue emerged overnight as Haines City Police reported that the burgundy 2011 Nissan Altima that Cherizard fled the scene in was spotted near Boynton Beach via a tag reader at a toll plaza just after midnight.

“Everybody needs to be on the lookout,” Elensky said. “He’s obviously armed and dangerous.”

The vehicle Cherizard is in has the Florida tag GZN C82.

According to HCPD, 48-year-old Nicole Guillume, the child's aunt, arrived at Citrus Ridge Apartments for a welfare check. After that, according to HCPD, a confrontation ensued and Cherizard fired a handgun, killing Guillume.

After Cherizard left the complex, two other shooting victims — 23-year-old Eli Junia Normil, and her child, Elizabelle Frenel — were found inside. Both Normil and Guillume died from gunshot wounds to the head. Cherizard and Normil were in a relationship and had two children together, according to HCPD.

Haines City Police said the girl was flown to Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando where she underwent surgery. As of Saturday morning, Elensky told the Orlando Sentinel that the girl “will most likely die,” adding that she is on life support and considered “brain dead.”

In a video news conference at the scene of the shooting Friday night, Elensky said the girl had been shot three times, including once in the head.

“It’s disgusting to say the least,” Elensky said when asked about the child being injured. “… We need to find him before he kills anybody else.”

In the early hours of Saturday morning, according to HCPD, Cherizard took to Facebook to acknowledge the incident and closed by apologizing to his children.



“Daddy is so sorry with all my heart cuz I can’t believe this happened”

""Despite his indicated remorse, make no mistake about it — this man is a monster,” Elensky said in the release. “To consciously shoot three innocent, unarmed females is nothing less than being a coward.

Officials with the Lake County Sheriff’s Office said James Reidnauer and Brent van Besein fired shots at a 16-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl as they were walking home from a convenience store.

According to an arrest affidavit, it started when the children took a shortcut on their way home from the store. Reidnauer asked what they were doing and the boy responded that they were just walking home.

The children said Reidnauer then fired a shot into the ground and van Besien used a racial slur and fired a shotgun near where they were standing.

The kids ran home and told their mother, who called the police.

Reidnauer told deputies he had fired a warning shot at “two meth heads walking through the area because they were acting suspiciously.”

Both men denied using racial slurs.

801,Tavares students take on world in robotics championship,"TAVARES — Tavares Middle School, which sent a robotics team to the VEX IQ state championship for the first time this year, will also send the team to its first world tournament April 26 to May 1.

The team of four sixth-graders will go to Kentucky for five days, along with their robot, Charles, to participate in the competition as well as an associated robotics expo.

“It’s very interesting, because it’s more than just people from Florida coming,” said Cadence Lamoreaux, a student who previously attended the championship on her team at Astatula Elementary.

Adam Westphal, who was on that same team, said they truly found out how far people came from last year when they were paired with a Chinese team for a teamwork challenge.

The Chinese team didn’t speak English, he said, so they had to learn completely new ways to communicate.

Both students said it was a competition like no other, with new learning opportunities and fun activities to do while awaiting the next round of competition.

Cadence attended a “Girl Power” talk last year, and both students had the opportunity to see a wide variety of robot designs, all made with the same parts they were using.

“It didn’t matter if you were driving or not, you’ll have fun,” Adam said.

The other two students, Paul Halecki and Jacob Sabelli, will attend the competition for the first time, having clinched a surprise victory in the state competition.

“We were doing pretty ... not good,” Paul said. “We were feeling down because we thought we weren’t going to make it.”

But they earned their way into the world championship a different way.

Each year, students are asked to make a video on a subject based on that year’s STEM-related theme. This year’s theme was math.

The team did a video on gear ratios, how the size of your gear impacts both power output and efficiency. Paul said he suggested the topic as a joke, but the team latched on quickly, and it turned out to be an award-winning idea.

Since the team didn’t perform as well at the state competition, however, Jacob said they’ve been thinking up new ways to compete. The latest design challenge? Fingers.

This year’s design challenge is to grab orange cones from around a table and push them into scoring zones, then to drop one more on top of the rest. The team gets an extra point if they can hang from a pole. There's a driver-controlled segment and an automated segment the students must pre-program.

Jacob said the fingers will work by allowing the robot to grab four cones at once, and curved tips should allow it to drag them over steps separating the score zones.

The team hasn’t finished development yet, but they’ve made great strides since competition began in October, Adam said. They’ve nearly doubled their point totals this year and Cadence designed the arms that allow them to hang from a pole on the course, giving them a chance to earn bonus points.

Their teacher, Christopher Crosby, is looking forward to seeing them take all they’ve learned to Kentucky next week.

“It’s exciting. It’s encouraging that they’re using their problem-solving skills to compete,” he said. “This is student-led. I’m just here to guide, be a mentor and help them where I think they need it. I have literally not touched the robot. We’re not allowed.”

The competition hosts 400 international teams, meaning awards are hard to come by on the world stage.

But the Tavares students don't seem to mind the odds. When asked what they hoped to get out of the competition, each student just said they wanted to have a good time.

In total, the team has won three major awards this year — one for teamwork, one for excellence, and their STEM video award.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190418/tavares-students-take-on-world-in-robotics-championship?rssfeed=true,2019-04-18T10:25:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
804,"After Beyoncé surprise album, Netflix 'Homecoming' documentary features familiar FAMU faces","Before the much-anticipated Netflix documentary, “Homecoming: A Film By Beyoncé” was scheduled to start streaming at 3:01 a.m. Wednesday, Don P. Roberts wasn’t quite sure what to expect.

The Queen Bey dropped a surprise 40-track album Wednesday to accompany the documentary, wowing the world and her faithful Beehive of fans.

But the former Marching 100 drum major — chosen by the star’s team to help bring the authentic HBCU culture to her 2018 Coachella concert upon which the film is based — expected it to include glimpses of faces familiar to Florida A&M University alumni.

In a nod to the pop culture icon’s international status – and the total control she commands over her empire — Netflix remained mum on any advance details.

Earlier this month, it did release a trailer, a fast-moving tease of some of the scenes.

Included was snapshot of men wearing FAMU T-shirts, which already has made its way around social media.

USA Today reported it gives “glimpses at Queen Bey and her team's preparation for the performance, set to the words of Maya Angelou.”

""I want to be representative of my race: the human race,"" the late poet and activist can be heard saying. ""I have a chance to show how kind we can be, how intelligent and generous we can be. I have a chance to teach and to love and to laugh. I know that when I finish doing what I'm sent here to do, I will be called home, and I will go home without any fear (or) trepidations wondering what's going to happen.""

Special premier viewings were held Tuesday night at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and Texas Southern University in the star’s hometown of Houston.

Myrcele Neal-Scott, president of the Marching 100, saw the documentary with a group of other band members who are in Torrance, Calif., to perform at the closing ceremony of the Honda Campus All-Star Challenge championship Tuesday night.

Seeing Marching 100 alum who they looked up to performing with Beyonce’ was powerful, Neal-Scott said.

“It was inspiring and humbling,” said the graduating senior from Pompano Beach.

Netflix's 'Homecoming' documentary has FAMU ties

The two-hour-plus film captures a behind-the-scenes look at Beyoncé’s groundbreaking 2018 performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.

In it, she exposed the world to homecoming culture at HBCUs, complete with dancers, a nod to Greek life, marching bands and drumlines.

Beyoncé’s affinity for HBCUs stems from her father, who graduated from Fisk University, a private HBCU in Nashville, Tennessee.

The Florida A&M influence was propelled when Beyoncé’s team requested the assistance of Roberts, a FAMU alum and former Marching 100 drum major, who is recognized as one of the country’s most respected music educators.

Roberts attended FAMU from 1980 to 1985, earning his degree in music education. One of his classmates was Shelby Chipman, current professor of music and director of marching and pep bands at the university.

Based in Atlanta, Roberts is CEO of DRUMLine Live, music supervisor for DeKalb County Schools and former band director at Southwest DeKalb High School.

Roberts gained national recognition as executive band consultant for the movie “Drumline,” where he was in charge of working with actors, creating the precision drills and more.

He also served as band consultant for the BET series “The Quad” which which was set on a fictitious black university campus in Atlanta.

DRUMLine Live is an international tour production, including alumni from Florida A&M, Tennessee State, Alabama State and other HBCUs.

Among its members are former FAMU musicians and dancers with campus troupes. Former Marching 100 drum major Slater Thorpe, serves as its show announcer, the same role he snagged for Beyoncé’s Coachella performance.

2018 Coachella performance: First black woman to headline, other achievements

It was Roberts who was sought after by Beyoncé’s team to help bring the HBCU experience to her Coachella production.

“None of us had a role in the 'Homecoming' Netflix special,” Roberts said. “However, I'm sure you will see most of them in the special.”

Roberts said DRUMLine Live was responsible for securing HBCU-experienced band members to blend in with the group already established by Beyoncé’s team for her performance at Coachella.

“Her musicians were incredible and so were the members of DRUMLine Live,” Roberts said. “They made an extraordinary team that made musical history together. We were not responsible for the steppers and dancers. I selected all members from DRUMLine Live and assisted her musical director with rehearsals. I think our greatest role was bringing true HBCU authenticity to Coachella.”

That was critical, Robert said.

“Going into the project, my biggest concern was being authentic to the HBCU culture,” he said. “I know the Beehive was tough, but I knew if we did not properly pay tribute to the HBCU culture, inclusive of marching band, sororities, and fraternities, we were gonna have to deal with the wrath and scorn of HBCU band heads and alumni worldwide.”

Fortune magazine reported Beyoncé — the first black woman to headline at Coachella — broke viewership records on YouTube, with her HBCU-themed set attracting 458,000 simultaneous global viewers at its peak, making it the most viewed Coachella performance ever.

Her performance included over 100 singers, dancers, and musicians.

“I applaud the Queen and her staff for taking such a huge risk, but also for flawlessly executing what some may have thought was an impossible task,” Roberts said. “She is now a part of HBCU music history forever. I think her impact will be felt in the future by the positive exposure it will bring to the HBCU culture.”

805,Local father outraged after judge grants sex offender visits with his 8-year-old daughter,"0 Local father outraged after judge grants sex offender visits with his 8-year-old daughter

A local judge granted a registered sex offender the right to supervised visits with his fiancées daughter, and it left the girl’s father furious.

Nicholas Kolehmainen’s ex-wife is engaged to a registered sex offender and a clerical error granted that offender the right to unsupervised visits with their Kolehamiens 8-year-old daughter.

The clerk of courts admitted the error and Tuesday they went back to court, but the final decision left Kolehamien outraged.

“I was angry and in shock to know that this could happen to me as a father. My objection to this person being around my daughter was pretty much ignored and it’s very upsetting,” Kolehmainen said.

TRENDING:

He was furious when he heard the Baker County judge's decision in court Tuesday to allow a registered sex offender to have supervised visits with his daughter.

Previously a clerical error gave registered sex offender Adam Brunner unsupervised visitations with the girl because he’s engaged to her mom.

Brunner was a former Baker County teacher who plead guilty to having sex with a student who was a minor.

Tuesday the judge decided to make Brunner’s visits supervised.

During the court appointment Kolehmainen presented the judge with a list of reasons why he objected, he said he feels the judge ignored them.

“In court I felt absolutely powerless, I was literally told that as this child’s father you can’t do anything about this,” Kolehmainen said.

That’s why he now has a mission to contact legislators who can help change the Florida statute that allows this to happen. He’s also encouraging other families to call their local legislators as well.

“The more I’ve been exposed to the court system it’s absolutely terrifying and they’re not protecting my child and they’re probably not protecting other children as well. The more I know the more terrifying it is,” Kolehmainen said.

806,Bus stop safety town hall: Lee County community searches for solutions to keep kids safe,"Lee County School District making some of its roughly 7,000 bus stops permanent was among several ideas discussed at a town hall on bus stop safety Tuesday night.

The town hall at the Lee County Public Education Center drew about 50 attendees and was broadcast on the district’s Facebook page and YouTube channel, where viewers submitted questions. The meeting follows the death of 8-year-old Layla Aiken, who died after being hit by a car while waiting for her bus in north Cape Coral last month.

School choice, school start times, benches, lighting, sidewalks were among the issues that representatives of the school board, the district, and the city of Cape Coral discussed. Lauren Stillwell, a spokeswoman for the district, said that school resource officers are also educating kids in school and Lee County Sheriff Office deputies are patrolling bus stop areas in the morning and educating kids if they see unsafe behavior.

Permanent bus stops

Cape Coral Traffic Engineer Bill Corbett previously said there have been 16,000 school bus stop changes countywide during the current school year, for various reasons, including the presence of registered sex offenders and students moving.

""How can you keep up with 16,000 bus stop changes?"" an audience member asked. ""How is that even possible?""

Lee County School District Superintendent Greg Adkins said he thinks the district can establish some of the stops as permanent, to prevent confusion that arises with so many changes.

""That's where I think we have an opportunity to go to from here that would help,"" Adkins said.

School start times

Adkins said there are four different tiers for school start times for the district's 49,000 students — one for high schools, one for middle schools, and an early and late tier for elementary schools. The issue has come up as parents have questioned why students walk to school so early while it's still dark outside.

Adkins said he's not opposed to looking at start times, but cautioned that consolidating the tiers would require the district hiring more bus drivers, since many already drive more than one of the district's 753 bus routes. He said hiring drivers and substitute drivers is already difficult because there is fierce competition for those qualified, who could drive for large companies like Coca-Cola instead and make more money.

He also said pushing back some school start times may mean students end up walking home in the dark.

School choice and bus stop location

Adkins said the school choice system has been in place since desegregation in the 1960s, and that it isn't feasible to transfer to a strictly neighborhood school system, as some attendees suggested, because the schools aren't located proportionate to the population of students.

Buy Photo Greg Adkins, the superintendent for Lee County School District addresses a crowd during a school bus safety forum at the Lee County Public Education Center on Tuesday April, 16, 2019. (Photo: Andrew West)

He said the district it looking into ""proximity-based student assignment"" to bring down the number of school choices around where a student lives. This would decrease some of the bus ride times and ""get more of that neighborhood school concept,"" he said.

Roger Lloyd, transportation services director with the School District, said state law stipulates that buses are supposed to be on public roads and picking up students where private and public roads meet, for example, in front of gated communities. But he said some routes go into communities when it is the safest stop location for students.

A mother concerned about stop locations told officials safety should be the priority for every location, the way it is for those routes that enter private communities.

Another woman, describing herself as a concerned grandmother, addressed the officials and called for an adopt-a-bus stop program, which Adkins said he wants to see implemented. He said it would ""certainly be a good solution for many of our bus stops,"" but wouldn't necessarily cover each stop.

Bus stop benches

The city of Cape Coral has formed a stakeholders group with city and county staff and members of the local Rotary Club chapter to come up with solutions addressing bus stop safety. The group plans to have recommendations prepared for Cape Coral City Council by May 20.

In the meantime, the Rotary Club of Cape Coral has been preparing to deploy hundreds of benches attached to movable concrete slabs in the city.

Ed Bolter, a Rotarian and vice president of Lamar Advertising, said that he has a contract for 200 benches to be deployed, pending a City Council resolution scheduled for a discussion May 6. He said the group is also awaiting a quote from a vendor on solar-powered lights that could attach to signs near bus stops.

""Subject to quote, we'll get it done,"" Bolter said.

Cape Coral Mayor Joe Coviello said at a council meeting Monday that there was ""a lot of discussion"" that needed to take place before rolling out the Rotary Club's benches.

""I know there's a lot of moving parts, but if we could at least get something on this piece moving sooner than later, that would be great,"" Coviello said.

Another group, Benches for our Babes, has been putting out benches for students to sit on while they wait for the bus as well.

Sales tax

When asked about the school district's half-cent sales tax that voters passed in a referendum last year, Adkins specified that the referendum language stipulates the money for capital improvements and technology on school property, and that the district doesn't have the ability to use the funds for streetlights near bus stops.

SPARTANBURG, SC (WSPA) - A man accused of leading troopers on a chase then leaving his 1-year-old daughter to die inside a burning car is facing new criminal charges.

Imhotep Norman, who goes by O'Sha Norman, had already been charged with homicide by child abuse. He's now charged with failure to stop for blue lights and siren resulting in death. The 26-year-old also faces three new counts of posession with intent to distribute drugs.

On Monday, WSPA spoke with family members who said they stand behind him as they grieve the loss of his daughter Xena.

To Xena's family, the 1-year-old was a shining light - quick to laugh and full of hugs.

Her grandmother Christian Palmer helped care for her every day.

""She was a lovely baby, you couldn't do nothing but love her, nothing but love,"" said Palmer.

Friday night, Xena's life ended when the car she was in caught fire.

""I just couldn't believe it. I couldn't imagine. It just hurt me, broke my heart. My heart is broken in so many pieces,"" Palmer said.

Troopers say they were pursuing her father for speeding when his car burst into flames. They say Norman eventually escaped, leaving Xena inside.

""I just know that the car wasn't on fire when I got out of the car. I would have stayed in the car with my daughter. I would never have got out the car while the car was on fire,"" Norman told a judge at his bond hearing on Friday night.

The family of Xena's mother, Thaisa Young, joined together Monday in solidarity behind Xena's dad.

""We believe him, we 100 percent both sides of the family believe what he's saying, if he would have knew, he would not have got out of the car,"" said Xena's great aunt Renalla Clowney.

After the incident happened Friday on I-85 in Greenville County, Norman was charged with homicide by child abuse. Highway Patrol added four new charges, three of them possession with intent to distrubute drugs. Investigators say he threw a bag of what later was found to be marijuana, meth and amphetamines out of the car while they were in pursuit.

Despite the charges, the family asked for prayers for Xena's mother, and her father too.

""Just keep our family in prayer, that's all, just always keep us lifted up for our family that's all we need is prayer, prayer,"" said Palmer.

The family is still making arrangements for the child's burial.

They've set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for the funeral costs, and are grateful to the people who have supported them so far.",http://www.wfla.com/news/national/family-stands-behind-father-accused-of-leaving-daughter-to-die-in-burning-car/1930222621,2019-04-16T16:42:04Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

809,Parents of child found playing alone arrested for child neglect,"- Two parents were arrested in Volusia County, after South Daytona police say the man and woman were found sleeping in a truck while their young daughter played alone outside.

Police arrested Taylor Sarro, 28, and Brant Kipe, 29.

They say a witness called 911 after seeing a 2-year-old girl playing alone at Reed Canal Park.

After looking looking around, officers say the child ran toward a truck, where investigators saw three people sleeping inside.

They say one man was sleeping in the front seat with a child unattended, wile Sarro and Kipe were found sleeping in the back of the truck.

Investigators say Kipe and Sarro said that the child found playing alone was their daughter and that she was inside the truck when they fell asleep.

According to their arrest affidavit, both Kipe and Sarro were arrested for child neglect.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/parents-of-child-found-playing-alone-arrested-for-child-neglect,2019-04-15T20:19:51Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
810,Haines City triple-shooting suspect will face a judge on Monday,"- The man accused of shooting and killing two women and a child will face a judge for the first time after turning himself in.

Haines City police said 38-year-old Ernst Cherizard was on the run for two days. They said he even fled to south Florida, but on Sunday, he turned himself to police. Cherizard is accused of fatally shooting his 23-year-old girlfriend, Eli Junia Normil, inside a Haines City apartment complex before turning the gun on Normil’s 6-year-old daughter, Elizabelle Frenel.

Police said the little girl was shot three times on Friday night. She passed away the following day. They said Cherizard also shot Normil’s mother, 48-year-old Nicole Guillume, who showed up a short time later looking for her daughter, the family told FOX 13.

While on the run, police said Cherizard posted to social media, apologizing for the slayings on Facebook. The post said in part that he and Normil were fighting for the gun when ""he lost it,"" adding that it was like he ""heard voices in his head” and what he did was “pure evil.”

""Daddy is so sorry with all my heart,"" he wrote. ""I can't even explain what happened [because] I can't believe this happened.""

Court records and police documents revealed a trend of violence inside the household that built up to Friday night’s shooting. In April 2017, Normil filed a domestic violence injunction against Cherizard.

Months later, he was arrested for domestic violence aggravated battery against Normil while she was seven months pregnant with her twins. Those twins are now over a year old, and will have to grow up without their mom.

Police said Cherizard fled in his vehicle after the shooting and was even spotted at a Boynton Beach toll plaza after midnight on Saturday. Authorities with the Haines City Police Department said they teamed up with the U.S. Marshals to find him.

After turning himself in for Friday’s shooting, detectives said they spent hours interviewing Cherizard before booking him into jail. There is no official word on the charges he will face.

Cherizard is scheduled to go before a judge at 1:30 p.m.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/haines-city-triple-shooting-suspect-will-face-a-judge-on-monday,2019-04-15T13:56:15Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
811,Lee County school district plans to host town hall meeting on bus stop safety,"CLOSE Follow these tips to stay safe at the school bus stop. Dan DeLuca, Wochit

Cape Coral resident Cristin Maigis doesn't want her 4-year-old daughter waiting at a dark, unsafe school bus stop when she starts elementary school.

That is why she is participating in a grassroots effort to make bus stops in Cape Coral safer by putting as many benches and picnic tables at them as possible.

The effort was inspired by a March 25 deadly hit and run crash at a Cape Coral bus stop. Layla Aiken, 8, was struck as she sat on the edge of the road.

From left, Ava Pellechio, 10, Carolina Vega, 10, and Zak Woods, 8, all students at Gulf Elementary in Cape Coral, were able to wait for their school bus on a recently installed bench in Melissa Shollack's property. Shollack was so moved after learning about Layla Aiken's hit and run death last month, that she decided to place benches on her property to allow students waiting for the bus in the mornings to sit away from the dangerous roadside.

But parents want the city and Lee County school district to do something and that prompted the school district to organize a town hall meeting on bus stop safety. The meeting is set for 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Lee County Public Education Center. It will be broadcast on the district’s Facebook page and YouTube channel.

""They need to take this seriously because these are children's lives,"" Maigis said. ""They need to see that this doesn't happen again.""

Lee County schools: 8-year-old's death spurs residents to put benches in yards

Cape Coral residents started organizing efforts to make bus stops safer after Layla's death. Some bought benches and put them in their yards. They also met Saturday in an airplane hangar in North Fort Myers to assemble picnic tables to put at bus stops.

""You know what, I had a very low expectation of society, but this has really opened my eyes,"" Maigis said. ""I don't really know why we have all come together, but I think it's because of the children. It comes down to kids.""

The purpose of Tuesday's meeting is to give residents a chance to ask questions and share solutions. Some already have asked for more street lights and sidewalks and for the school district and city of Cape Coral to put benches at bus stops.

Some children sit on the road because the grass is wet early in the morning. Benches would give them a place to sit away from the road.

""This is a complex issue with really a multi-tier solution, and we all have to come together with the answers,"" Superintendent Greg Adkins said.

There are nearly 7,000 school bus stops in Lee County, with 1,671 in Cape Coral.

One idea that seems to be gaining some traction is a commitment by the Rotary Club of Cape Coral to buy and put 200 benches at bus stops in Cape Coral. The benches the club wants to deploy, if it gets the OK to do so, are made of recycled plastic and are 6 feet long. The club also plans to put reflective tape on the benches.

""We committed ... to work with our Rotarians and also the city of Cape Coral to really make this a reality in the short term and in the long term,"" Adkins said.

Rotarian Ed Bolter said he is not sure yet how much the bench project will cost, but there is no doubt that his organization can make it happen.

""Our solution is just ... one spoke of the wheel,"" he said. ""It's not a fix all, but it's a start.""

Adkins said another idea the district plans to explore is how to formalize something already happening at some bus stops — parents standing at stops with students to make sure they are safe.

""What we want to do going into next year is advertise this concept and then work with our schools and our parents to maybe get this a little bit more organized,"" he said.

Don Armstrong, a former school board member and a parent, said during a recent school board meeting that bus stop safety was an issue in 2011 when he was a board member. He said he organized a meeting on the topic, but nothing was done.

""Eight years later, we are here because of a tragedy,"" he said. ""That's not the only tragedy. The tragedy is why we didn't do anything about it long before it got to this point.""

814,Possible shark attack sends 10-year-old girl to the hospital,"0 Possible shark attack sends 10-year-old girl to the hospital

ST. AUGUSTINE BEACH, Fla. - A young girl is recovering after she was reportedly bitten by a shark while swimming.

St. Johns Co. Fire Rescue said a 10-year-old girl may have been bitten by a shark in St. Augustine Beach.

It happened around 5:30 p.m. Friday while she was swimming in the ocean. The little girl only had minor injuries but she was taken to Flagler hospital just in case.

Stephanie Geiger said she used to surf and she brings her daughter to the beach to swim every chance they get. As a former surfer she’s seen sharks before and was saddened to learn of the young girl possibly being bitten by one, but this is the reason she’s urging others to take precaution.

“That’s pretty scary and I would say with young children just to stay really close by and maybe not go out at certain times of the day when we know there’s more feeding times for shark,” Geiger said.

Research from UNF’s Florida Museum shows from 2007 through 2016 there were 243 shark attacks. Only one was deadly.

Jason Mongooddeacon is another beachgoer who said the incident with the 10-year-old won’t stop him from getting in the water but it will make him more aware of what’s in the water.

“I’m not really concerned, I’m pretty aware. I think it’s very important to have fun in the water but also be aware of your surroundings,” Mongooddeacon said.

Experts believe people should also watch what time they swim because sharks are known to be more active at dusk and dawn.

815,Same-sex parents of little girl battling stage 4 cancer get 'hateful' message from would-be donor,"- The parent’s of an 18-month-old girl named Callie who is battling stage 4 cancer are shocked after receiving a hateful message from a would-be donor.

According to her GoFundMe page, Callie was diagnosed with advanced neuroblastoma on New Year’s Day.

“She will need 18 months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, she will need a bone marrow transplant, and also will need future surgery to remove the tumor once it shrinks,” said the post on GoFundMe.

Her parents, Tiffany and Albree Shaffer, have been by her side around the clock. They said they have been receiving and overwhelming amount of support since they started the ‘Callie Strong, Tiny But Mighty’ Facebook page, which chronicles Callie’s journey back to health.

Through all the support, unfortunately, they received one message that was difficult to read.

The message read: “My prayers for Callie. I was going to donate $7600.00 to her fund, but I found out her parents are lesbian. I’ve chosen to donate to St. Jude due to that fact. Sorry. I’ll still pray for her though, but maybe it’s God’s way of getting your attention that she needs a mommy and a daddy, not two mommies.”

Despite how badly it made them feel, Callie’s parents tell Fox 35 it was, in a way, a blessing.

“The most important part to us is the love, support and prayers to our little Callie.”

Her parents also say that since word got out about the disturbing message, Callie’s fan base has grown big time.

We have went from a few thousand likes on her Facebook page to almost 8,000 since the original post and the original post on her page has reached 1.1 million people.”

As for Callie, on Friday, her parents posted that she will begin round 5 of chemo in a few days and that 98 percent of her tumor is dead.

816,Several people rescued from Gulf; double-red flags going up ahead of bad weather,"DESTIN — Authorities responded to a handful of water rescue calls in Okaloosa and Walton counties Saturday as local officials raised double-red flags along some beaches to warn people away from the Gulf of Mexico as potentially severe storms approached Northwest Florida.

Shortly after noon, emergency personnel were called to a Coral Court on Okaloosa Island, where a young girl had ingested water while swimming in the Gulf.

The initial call noted a drowning, but bystanders were able to assist the 12-year-old before emergency crews arrived, according to Okaloosa Island Fire District Chief Kevin Carvalho. The girl was evaluated and taken to a local hospital for observation, Carvalho said.

In Walton County, South Walton Fire Marshal Sammy Sanchez said crews were called to a handful of water rescues, but there were no drownings.

However, Sanchez added that double-red flags were going up on county beaches to signal the Gulf was closed to swimmers.

""We're going to get some bad weather (Sunday),"" said Sanchez, who urged beachgoers to take note of the double-red flags. Dangerous surf conditions will continue into Monday, he added.

According to the National Weather Service office in Mobile, Alabama, a high surf advisory and rip current risk will remain in effect along the western Florida Panhandle through early Monday morning.

""Heed the warnings,"" Sanchez said of the flags.

819,Convicted killer accused of sending nude photo to 12-year-old girl,"FORT WHITE, Fla. - A convicted murderer who was released from prison in February last year is in trouble again after authorities in Columbia County said he sent a 12-year-old girl a nude photo of himself and tried to lure her to his home.

William Edward Ward, 60, of Fort White was arrested Thursday afternoon at his business.

Ward was charged with obscene communication and cruelty toward a child. Both charges were described as using a computer to solicit or lure a child and transmitting harmful materials to a minor.

According to the arrest report, the Columbia County Sherriff’s Office began investigating Ward last Thursday after the parent of a 12-year old girl filed a complaint. The parent said a man had been sending inappropriate text messages to her daughter via Snapchat.

According to the report, the messages began on April 1.

An investigator looked at the messages and learned the girl had been in contact with a man whose Snapchat handle was Billyward2019. The investigator later identified Billyward2019 as William Ward, the report said.

When the investigator first started reviewing the messages, he discovered images of a woman wearing clothing from a clothing line that the investigator said was sponsored by the adult website Pornhub.com.

The investigator noted in the report that he believed Billyward2019 was using the images and the conversations to lure the 12-year-old girl into exchanging sexual images or participating in a sexual act.

That same day, another investigator took the girl’s cellphone to further investigate the communication between Ward and the girl and took over the girl’s Snapchat account.

According to the report, the investigator who was secretly pretending to be the 12-year-old girl got a message from Ward stating he could buy the girl an outfit from the Pornhub website and that she could get away with anything and do anything she wanted.

The undercover investigator said Ward even mentioned that he was surprised at how old she actually was and that she looked like she was 19. The investigator noted in the report that Ward mentioned how he noticed the girl and that she is a ""tease.""

The next three pages of the report were heavily redacted but the end of the report states that:

On April 5, Ward attempted to make plans for the child to come to his place for conversation.

On April 10, Ward messaged the girl to come over to his place to spend the night.

Ward sent the girl a nude picture of himself.

On Thursday, detectives showed up at Ward’s business where he was taken into custody. According to the detective, Ward confessed to sending inappropriate messages to a minor.

Ward made his first appearance in court Friday morning where a judge set his bond at $200,000.

Court records show that in August 1984, Ward was sentenced to 70 years in prison in Indiana for second-degree murder and armed burglary, but he was released from prison in February of last year.

He moved to Fort White, Florida, just four days after his release and was placed on one year of probation that ended this past February.

824,Florida History: What Oscar-winning celebrity committed suicide in a Florida beach house?,"He was wearing a swim suit and a bath robe. His body was hanging in a closet of a rented beach cottage, a red and white belt cinched around his neck.

When he didn't show up for breakfast at a nearby restaurant, a neighbor went to the house and found him.

John Monk Saunders -- Army aviator, author, Rhodes Scholar, magazine editor, Academy Award-winning writer, and recently divorced husband of actress Fay Wray, of ""King Kong"" fame -- was dead at age 42.

""BEACH WRITER HANGS SELF,"" screamed the banner Page 1 headline in The Fort Myers News-Press on March 12, 1940. It was front-page news across the country, too.

More classic Hollywood: How Veronica Lake's career began and ended in Florida

The small, two-bedroom cottage that Saunders rented in Fort Myers Beach on Florida's southwest coast was about as far as you could get from Hollywood, where his stories of wartime fliers were turned into classic movies such as ""Wings,"" which won the first Oscar for best motion picture.

Saunders had been in a tailspin for a long time. Handsome and talented, he was once dubbed the ""Golden Boy."" But alcohol, drugs and mood swings began to dominate his personality.

And then there was the way he treated his wife.

King Kong desired Wray's character so much that he fought off airplanes on top of the Empire State Building. But in real life, Saunders cheated constantly on his wife, neglecting her and saying she bored him. Toward the end of their marriage, he even kidnapped their two-year-old daughter, and spent all her money.

He didn't leave a suicide note. His life was one long suicide note.

Except to early film fans, Saunders is mostly forgotten, but the sad arc of his life is getting attention again in an excellent new memoir by Wray's daughter. And few know that if it wasn't for Saunders, the man many consider Hollywood's most debonair actor might have a different name.

***

Fay Wray never forgot the first time she saw Saunders at the gates of Paramount's studio.

""It was a warm summer afternoon. He was dressed in white flannels, a dark-blue blazer and wore a white Panama hat. I thought he was astonishingly good-looking.""

Wray's recollection is quoted in her daughter Victoria Riskin's new book, ""Fay Wray and Robert Riskin: A Hollywood Memoir"" (Pantheon). In telling the story of Wray's happier marriage to her father, screenwriter Riskin (""It Happened One Night""), she recounts her childhood surprise at discovering her mother had been wed before.

Saunders and Wray met in 1927. She was 18, a rising star who had never gone on a date. He was ten years older. Wray felt ""a current of sensory feeling"" when Saunders touched her arm. They fell hard for each other, but he was having an affair with the wife of studio chief Jesse Lasky, and he told her he wasn't planning to stop.

She married him, anyway.

In her youthful ""confusion,"" Riskin wrote, she tried to accept a man who drank heavily and blamed his infidelities on being ""oversexed.""

On the surface, they were glamour personified. She became an icon for playing the Beauty to King Kong's Beast. His aviation and underworld tales were turned into movies for legendary directors William Wellman, Josef von Sternberg and Howard Hawks.

Saunders' pinnacle was winning the Oscar for Best Story for Hawks' ""The Dawn Patrol."" But as his drinking magnified, the work dried up, Riskin wrote.

The couple had brief glimpses of happiness, but then Wray would catch him drunk or with other women. Saunders would make anti-Semitic, pro-Hitler comments. At a party, he decked actor Herbert Marshall, who had lost a leg in World War I, which played badly in the gossip columns.

Wray became pregnant and they had a daughter, Susan, but it didn't help their relationship.

""John's decline accelerated,"" Riskin wrote. ""His pupils were often enlarged, his eyes vacant, his movements bizarrely slowed.""

When she woke up to find him injecting a drug into her, Wray finally asked for a divorce. He retaliated by selling their house and taking all her money.

As she worked to replenish her bank accounts, he kidnapped their daughter for a couple of months and eventually landed in Charlottesville, Va., where he checked into a hospital for ""a nervous condition"" and had their daughter put in the pediatric unit.

Custody laws favored fathers in Virginia at the time, Riskin wrote, but Wray managed to take Susan back to California and get a divorce. Saunders went for more treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, but finally headed south with a nurse, winding up in Fort Myers.

""For a long time, John had been standing precariously at the abyss,"" Riskin wrote. ""Now he had reached the dark and lonely end of his journey.""

***

Saunders was no stranger to Florida. He did his military training here. And it was front page news when he arrived in Fort Myers in February 1940.

""This is Mr. Saunders' second season at the beach,"" the News-Press reported, ""which he says is the best place he has found for a rest, as well as the quietude he needs for his working hours.""

He apparently kept to himself, preferring long walks and time alone in his cottage. It was the 1940s version of celebrity rehab. But his nurse departed three days before he was found dead on March 11, and he probably shouldn't have been left alone.

After his suicide, rumors about a dissolute lifestyle quickly spread, and the paper followed up with another front page story on March 13: ""Beach Friends Deny 'Wild Tales' About John M. Saunders.""

Local restaurant owners got to know him, including Mrs. Watt Harris, who ran the tea room where he was supposed to show up for breakfast.

""Mr. Saunders was a lovable character,"" Mrs. Harris (no first name given in those days) told the News-Press. ""He was sensitive and nervous and not in good health and insisted on working long hours. Sometimes he drank too much and then hated himself for doing so.""

Harris said Wray called her soon after his death. According to national news accounts at the time, the actress was ""heartbroken,"" and had ""collapsed.""

""He often told me how proud he was of the fine life and happy times he had lived with Miss Wray,"" Harris told the Fort Myers paper. ""I don't know why he wanted to take his life except he was not happy and his work did not make his life complete.

""The only reason I'm saying all this about Mr. Saunders is that some people had spread wild tales,"" she added. ""He may have had too much to drink for his own good but he was always a gentleman.""

Why did he kill himself? Some trace Saunders' problems to the fact that he spent World War I in Florida -- as a flight instructor instead of in heroic combat. A columnist friend claimed that punching actor Marshall had exiled him from Hollywood, and he couldn't bear it. Today, his mood swings and drinking might be diagnosed as a bipolar disorder.

***

Saunders' abbreviated career remains, at best, a footnote in Hollywood history. In the 1920s and early 1930s, though, his name was big enough that it was a selling point in advertisements for his films.

Perhaps his true claim to fame is a gift he unknowingly gave to a young actor.

In 1931, Saunders wrote his only novel, ""Single Lady,"" a Lost Generation tale of a French girl and her soldier pals that critics felt was patterned too closely on Hemingway's writing. It was turned into a Broadway musical called ""Nikki."" Despite Wray as the star, it did about as well as the book, closing after 39 performances.

Her leading man in the show was a former acrobat and vaudeville comic with the curious moniker of Archibald Leach. Saunders had named Leach's character Cary Lockwood.

When Leach went to Hollywood, he needed to change his name to something suitable for a movie star. Fond of Wray and his experience acting with her, he chose the name Cary, then added the last name of Grant. You know the rest.

Until she died at age 96 in 2004, Wray never spoke unkindly about Saunders. When writing her autobiography, she fretted to a New York Times reporter that it was ""unfair"" to expose his weaknesses.

""How can anyone make a judgment on what other people do?'' Wray said in that 1989 interview. ''It's just not possible for me. It's so tragic that John had this theme in his life of living dangerously and dying young.''

In an interview last month with the Los Angeles Times about her memoir, Victoria Riskin said Wray ""didn’t talk a lot about (Saunders) except toward the end of her life. I found in some of her personal notes that she felt she had let him down. She knew she was stronger. She knew she was caring and didn’t find that key to open the door to saving him.

""She felt that she should have been able to help him, and she couldn’t. He was beyond help.""

Haines City, FLA (WFLA) - A man suspected of killing a 6-year-old girl and two other people at a home in Haines City on Friday has turned himself in. Ernst Cherizard, 38, appeared before a judge Monday afternoon. Cherizard now faces three counts of first-degree murder. The judge ordered that he be held in jail without bond.

Cherizard was wanted in connection with the shooting deaths of Elizabelle Frenel, 6, her mother Eli Junia Normil, 23, and Normil's aunt, Nicole Guillume, 48.

Police say Ernst Cherizard, 38, shot Frenel and her mother, 23-year-old Eli Junia Normil at the Citrus Ridge Apartments shortly before 7:30 p.m Friday. Normil died and the child was left critically injured.

When Normil's relatives came to the apartment to check on her, Cherizard told them they were not there. Her aunt, 48-year-old Nicole Guillume, returned to the complex and a confrontation ensued. That's when Cherizard fired a handgun and killed Guillume before fleeing. His vehicle was last seen passing a Boyton Beach toll plaza shortly after midnight Saturday, according to police.

Police arrived at the scene and Frenel was rushed to an Orlando hospital, where she died the next day.

Police said Normil and Cherizard were in a relationship and have two children together, but Frenel was not his child.

Court records indicate Normil had taken a restraining order out against Cherizard in April of 2017, but the order was lifted two weeks later.

Records also show Winter Haven Police arrested Cherizard on a domestic battery charge. The victim was listed as Normil.

In the early hours Saturday, Cherizard took to Facebook to acknowledge the crime and apologized to his children.

""Daddy is so sorry with all my heart cuz I can't believe this happened,"" he wrote in the post.

Centoria White lives in the complex and walked over to the apartment where the shooting happened with candles and balloons. She is heartbroken about what happened.

""I couldn't do nothing but cry. There's nothing to talk about. You just hurt inside,"" said White, as she held the candles so the wind wouldn't blow them over. ""I was just devistated. I stay right over there. So, devistated. Especially when it comes to the baby.""",http://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/no-bond-for-accused-shooter-in-haines-city-triple-homicide/1928401482,2019-04-15T23:52:17Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
832,North Port police: Man tried to lure young girls with alcohol,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

NORTH PORT, Fla. (WFLA) - North Port police need your help to track down a mysterious man who tried to lure two young girls with alcohol.

Inside Cedar Grove at the Woodlands in North Port, there's a community pool.

On Sunday afternoon, two girls, aged 14 and 15 years old were enjoying the day there when they were approached by a strange man. He had a thick German or Russian accent, and claimed he was 19, but the girls say he looked much older.

According to the arrest report, the man asked the girl their ages. He then asked if they wanted to go get sushi with him.

When they denied him, citing their age, he then asked if they wanted to go out for drinks instead.

“They told him they were much too young to do that. He kind of still pressed,” said NPPD spokesman Josh Taylor. “They said that he was making them uncomfortable and they were going to tell their parents about the ordeal, and he got out of there”

Police want to track him down and talk to him.

“Maybe there’s a perfectly good understanding, but from the information we have right now, something definitely seems a little weird,” said Taylor.

Residents in the area have had enough.

""Somebody's gotta be letting them in! They don't have a fob to get in [the pool] like we do, so that's the part that distressing me, who's letting them in?” said one distressed resident.

This is not the first time this pool has made headlines.

We recently reported a registered sexual predator, Timothy Rice, was spotted here in October trying to play with young children.

""Right now this community is on heightened sense of awareness to this type of activity,” said Taylor.

Officials say the man is white, approximate 5’8” with a normal build in his early to mid-30s. He was wearing a pink tank top and maroon or salmon colored shorts. He was also wearing sunglasses and a tan full brim hat.

833,Triple-murder suspect said argument sparked killings,"On Facebook, Ernst Cherizard told followers: ""IDK what happened all I know is we were fighting for the gun then I lost it.""

HAINES CITY — Ernst Cherizard had been on the run from authorities for hours when he went on Facebook early Saturday to talk about what had happened.

He said he had been planning to visit with his daughter, whom he hadn't seen since 2015. His current girlfriend, Eli Junia Normil, became jealous when he spoke with the daughter's mother, Cherizard wrote.

An argument and scuffle ensued inside the Citrus Ridge Apartments then Cherizard said he became overcome with anger.

""IDK what happened all I know is we were fighting for the gun then I lost it,"" Cherizard wrote on Facebook.

Authorities said he shot and killed Normil, 23, and critically wounded her daughter, 6-year-old Elizabelle Frenel, who was shot in the temple, face and arm. The girl was pronounced dead late Saturday night at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando.

After the initial two shootings, police said he fired two shots, killing Normil's aunt, Nicole Guillume, 48, after she had knocked on their apartment door searching for her niece.

He then ran to Normil's Nissan Altima about 7:30 p.m. and sped away, leading law enforcement on a manhunt to South Florida until he turned himself in to Haines City Police Sunday afternoon.

""I don't have much light to shed on it,"" Police Chief Jim Elensky said Monday when asked about more details. ""He's a monster.""

Jake Orr, a spokesman with the State Attorney's Office, said in the coming weeks the agency will determine if they will seek the death penalty against Cherizard for the three deaths. During his first appearance Monday, Cherizard was charged by Haines City Police with three counts of first-degree murder.

In the Facebook post, Cherizard, 38, went on to say he deserves the ""worst that's coming for me nothing less.""

""And one thing plz Guys don't keep no guns at your home man fr I we had 2 guns one for me n look now what happen I ---- my life up and the one I truly love and care bout I don't think my kids deserve this at all they won't know their mom this is pure evil and I'm not a evil person at All,"" Cherizard wrote. ""I took a great person live from you now it's time for me to pay for what I've done.""

In addition to more details about a motive, Elensky said detectives were still trying to piece together if Elizabelle was shot before her mother. The Altima was found in Miami and planned to be returned to Haines City this week.

Cherizard and Normil had 8-month-old twins together. The girl and boy were sleeping in another unit with relatives at the complex when the shootings occurred, Elensky said.

Normil's older sister, Ania Normil, said her sister rarely spoke about any strife with her boyfriend. She remembered hearing her older brother, Dominique, talk about the couple's spats.

""He told her that if you don't want to stay together, leave him,"" Ania Normil said.

As Ania mourned the death of her sister and niece so did classmates and her kindergarten teachers at Alta Vista Elementary.

In a statement, Alta Vista Principal Celeste Stewart wrote Elizabelle was outgoing, enjoyed dancing and loved to help her classmates after she finished her own work.

""Her teacher said this was almost like having another little teacher in the classroom,"" Stewart wrote.

Counselors were on the school grounds to help teachers and students.

""Elizabelle was a beautiful little girl who was sweet, kind and intelligent,"" Stewart wrote. ""She will be greatly missed by her classmates and the entire school community.""

834,Jurors deliberate on man who dropped daughter off bridge,"CLEARWATER — A Florida man who threw his 5-year-old daughter off a Tampa Bay area bridge four years ago knew what he was doing was wrong and should be found guilty of first-degree murder, a prosecutor told jurors Monday during closing arguments of his trial.

But John Jonchuck's defense attorney told jurors that although her client dropped his daughter, Phoebe, 62 feet into Tampa Bay, he was insane and didn't know what he was doing.

""We know he had an overwhelming sense of fear,"" assistant public defender Jessica Manuele said. ""He felt that somebody was after him and Phoebe.""

Jonchuck faces a life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder by jurors who started deliberating Monday afternoon after listening to three weeks of testimony.

Paul Bolan, an assistant state attorney, told jurors Jonchuck was motivated by anger over worries that Phoebe's mother was going to take the girl away from him and his own mother's doting attention to her granddaughter when she had been inattentive to him growing up.

Jonchuck's act was premediated and his fleeing the scene is proof he knew what he was doing was wrong, Bolan said.

""It was rage that drove him to it on top of that bridge,"" Bolan said. ""Did he know what he was doing and did he know it was wrong? The answer is clearly yes.""

Manuele told jurors Johnchuck loved Phoebe more than anything else in the world and there's no evidence he acted out of ""unbridled anger.""

Rather, Manuele said, his delusions led him to believe Phoebe was possessed, caused him to pour salt outside her window to keep spirits away and made him talk about the archangel Michael's coming.

""At that moment, he thought he was protecting his daughter,"" Manuele said. ""It will never make sense because it's insanity.""

Twelve hours before Phoebe's death, Jonchuck's divorce lawyer, Genevieve Torres, fearing for the girl's safety, called a state child protection hotline, according to authorities.

Torres told the Department of Children and Families operator that Jonchuck had driven to three churches in his pajamas with Phoebe in tow that morning, called Torres ""God"" and asked her to translate his stepmother's century-old Swedish Bible, which he carried and had become obsessed with. The attorney said Jonchuck also was paranoid that Phoebe wasn't his child.

But the operator thought the attorney was more worried about Jonchuck's safety than the girl's and did not report the call to authorities.

Just after midnight the next day, Jonchuck's PT Cruiser raced past officer William Vickers, who was heading home from his shift in his patrol car. He started following Jonchuck but never got close enough to read the license plate and didn't know Phoebe was inside, according to authorities.

As they reached the bridge's crest, Jonchuck stopped and got out. Vickers, fearing an ambush, stopped behind him, pulled his gun and yelled at Jonchuck to show his hands. He saw no weapon.

Jonchuck yelled at the officer, ""You have no free will."" He grabbed Phoebe from the back seat, held her over the side momentarily and then dropped her, according to police accounts.

Jonchuck drove off but was soon arrested. Vickers scrambled down a ladder to a dock below the bridge but couldn't see Phoebe in the dark water. A marine rescue boat was summoned, and her body was found hours later.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190415/jurors-deliberate-on-man-who-dropped-daughter-off-bridge?rssfeed=true,2019-04-15T16:31:12Z,The Ledger,Couple,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815

HAINES CITY — Haines City Police are reporting that a 6-year-old girl that was among three people shot at the Citrus Ridge Apartments on Friday night is considered brain dead.

According to a news release Saturday, Chief James Elensky said the search continues for Ernst Cherizard, 38, who is suspected in the shooting deaths of two women and the little girl.

However, a clue emerged overnight as Haines City Police reported that the burgundy 2011 Nissan Altima that Cherizard fled the scene in was spotted near Boynton Beach via a tag reader at a toll plaza just after midnight.

“Everybody needs to be on the lookout,” Elensky said. “He’s obviously armed and dangerous.”

The vehicle Cherizard is in has the Florida tag GZN C82.

According to HCPD, 48-year-old Nicole Guillume, a relative of the child and her mother, arrived at Citrus Ridge Apartments for a welfare check. After that, according to HCPD, a confrontation ensued and Cherizard fired a handgun, killing Guillume.

After Cherizard left the complex, two other shooting victims — the mother, 23-year-old Eli Junia Normil, and the child, Isabella Frenel — were found inside. Both Normil and Guillume died from gunshot wounds to the head. Cherizard and Normil were in a relationship and had two children together, according to HCPD.

Haines City Police said the girl was flown to Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando where she underwent surgery. As of Saturday morning, Elensky told the Orlando Sentinel that the girl “will most likely die,” adding that she is on life support and considered “brain dead.”

In a video press conference at the scene of the shooting Friday night, Elensky said the girl had been shot three times, including once in the head.

“It’s disgusting to say the least,” Elensky said when asked about the child being injured. “… We need to find him before he kills anybody else.”

In the early hours of Saturday morning, according to HCPD, Cherizard took to Facebook to acknowledge the incident and closed by apologizing to his children.



“Daddy is so sorry with all my heart cuz I can’t believe this happened”

""Despite his indicated remorse, make no mistake about it — this man is a monster,” Elensky said in the release. “To consciously shoot three innocent, unarmed females is nothing less than being a coward. To shoot a truly innocent 6-year-old child is disgusting and beyond comprehension. Moreover, he shot the child at least three times, once being in the head.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and the first responders who did everything they could at the scene. They also must live with this tragedy.”

The 30-year-old man said they kissed, and nothing else happened. The detective was told the two had been staying at the motel since April 5.

Brown interviewed the girl, who said she and the suspect had sex twice. The detective again talked with Alarcon-Zopiyactle, who then admitted to having sex with the girl, according to the report.

844,Man accused of supplying alcohol to minors in fatal rollover,"Thirteen kids were either in or on the SUV when it rolled over, killing a 17-year-old girl.

NORTH PORT — A 22-year-old man has been arrested and accused of supplying alcohol to several underage drinkers who were involved in a fatal rollover crash on April 6, the North Port Police Department said Thursday.

According to police, Damien Chanfrante, 22, of Punta Gorda, supplied alcohol to minors who later packed into a 2010 Rav4 SUV early on April 6. Thirteen people were in or on top of the vehicle when the driver, Stephanie Evrard, 19, failed to navigate a curve at Joewood Circle and Genip Court and the vehicle rolled over, police said.

One passenger, a 17-year-old girl, died at the scene and three others were seriously injured, according to police.

Police said many of the teens, including Evrard, were intoxicated at the time of the crash. Police received a tip that Chanfrante had supplied the teens with alcohol, and video surveillance showed him buying a case of Bud Light from a gas station in the area just before midnight.

Police also obtained multiple videos and photographs of the group drinking Bud Light and Twisted Tea, an alcoholic beverage. Police have released a list of names of people who were drinking alcohol before the accident. The arrest report states that Chanfrante provided the drinks to Evrard, Ericka Gaitin, 20, Cynthia Brown, 20, William Johnson, 20, and Turc Carroll, 19, along with three minors.

North Port Police officers arrested Chanfrante on Wednesday and charged him with eight counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He is being held at the Sarasota County Jail on $40,000 bond.

847,Mom: Abused 1-year-old has permanent brain damage,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - For the past two months, a 1-year-old girl has been fighting for her life, which will never be the same.

Syren Maloney's babysitter, Kala Vinson, 23, is accused of physically abusing the young girl while her mother was at work. Vinson was arrested in February, and on Thursday, she went before a judge at the Duval County Courthouse.

Syren's mother, Necole Clayton, said her daughter is receiving treatment at Nemours Children's Specialty Care. She said Syren has permanent brain damage.

According to the arrest report, Vinson told doctors Syren fell down the stairs. The hospital's Child Protection Team determined the girl's injuries were the result of physical abuse and not consistent with an accidental fall.

Doctors found Syren had a lacerated liver and spleen, internal bleeding, a fractured rib and brain swelling, investigators said.

Clayton spoke about her daughter in court on Thursday as the defense asked for a bond reduction.

""She's on 12 scheduled medications. That doesn't account for additional medications,"" Clayton said. ""She can't breathe on her own.""

A supervisor from the Department of Children and Families testified in court, saying after Vinson's arrest, DCF investigators removed her own two children, ages 2 and 3, after they investigated abuse in the home. DCF terminated Vinson's parental rights.



Clayton said her daughter had a full life ahead, and that it's been taken away.

""When you have a child, there is no part of you that wants to see them leave this earth before you do,"" she said.

Records on Thursday showed Vinson's bond remained at $250,000.

The suspected attacker appeared in juvenile court Thursday morning and was charged with aggravated battery. She was ordered by a judge to stay away from the victim and was then released into the custody of her father.

The student's arrest comes after the Tuesday fight at Cutler Bay Middle School, which was recorded by other students.

Denali Gonzalez told Local 10 News she doesn't know the girl who attacked her and isn't sure why she wanted to fight.

Gonzalez said she was left with broken knuckles and scratches to her body. She said she also passed out after she was beaten.

The suspect's trial has been set for June 11. She has been ordered to stay away from Denali.

A spokesperson from Miami-Dade County Public Schools claimed school officials notified the parents of the attacker and victim immediately, although Denali’s family said they were never notified by the school.

""A regrettable altercation between two female students took place after school hours on Tuesday afternoon,"" a statement from the school district read.

849,Florida History: What Oscar-winning celebrity committed suicide in a Florida beach house?,"He was wearing a swim suit and a bath robe. His body was hanging in a closet of a rented beach cottage, a red and white belt cinched around his neck.

When he didn't show up for breakfast at a nearby restaurant, a neighbor went to the house and found him.

John Monk Saunders -- Army aviator, author, Rhodes Scholar, magazine editor, Academy Award-winning writer, and recently divorced husband of actress Fay Wray, of ""King Kong"" fame -- was dead at age 42.

""BEACH WRITER HANGS SELF,"" screamed the banner Page 1 headline in The Fort Myers News-Press on March 12, 1940. It was front-page news across the country, too.

More classic Hollywood: How Veronica Lake's career began and ended in Florida

The small, two-bedroom cottage that Saunders rented in Fort Myers Beach on Florida's southwest coast was about as far as you could get from Hollywood, where his stories of wartime fliers were turned into classic movies such as ""Wings,"" which won the first Oscar for best motion picture.

Saunders had been in a tailspin for a long time. Handsome and talented, he was once dubbed the ""Golden Boy."" But alcohol, drugs and mood swings began to dominate his personality.

And then there was the way he treated his wife.

King Kong desired Wray's character so much that he fought off airplanes on top of the Empire State Building. But in real life, Saunders cheated constantly on his wife, neglecting her and saying she bored him. Toward the end of their marriage, he even kidnapped their two-year-old daughter, and spent all her money.

He didn't leave a suicide note. His life was one long suicide note.

Except to early film fans, Saunders is mostly forgotten, but the sad arc of his life is getting attention again in an excellent new memoir by Wray's daughter. And few know that if it wasn't for Saunders, the man many consider Hollywood's most debonair actor might have a different name.

***

Fay Wray never forgot the first time she saw Saunders at the gates of Paramount's studio.

""It was a warm summer afternoon. He was dressed in white flannels, a dark-blue blazer and wore a white Panama hat. I thought he was astonishingly good-looking.""

Wray's recollection is quoted in her daughter Victoria Riskin's new book, ""Fay Wray and Robert Riskin: A Hollywood Memoir"" (Pantheon). In telling the story of Wray's happier marriage to her father, screenwriter Riskin (""It Happened One Night""), she recounts her childhood surprise at discovering her mother had been wed before.

Saunders and Wray met in 1927. She was 18, a rising star who had never gone on a date. He was ten years older. Wray felt ""a current of sensory feeling"" when Saunders touched her arm. They fell hard for each other, but he was having an affair with the wife of studio chief Jesse Lasky, and he told her he wasn't planning to stop.

She married him, anyway.

In her youthful ""confusion,"" Riskin wrote, she tried to accept a man who drank heavily and blamed his infidelities on being ""oversexed.""

On the surface, they were glamour personified. She became an icon for playing the Beauty to King Kong's Beast. His aviation and underworld tales were turned into movies for legendary directors William Wellman, Josef von Sternberg and Howard Hawks.

Saunders' pinnacle was winning the Oscar for Best Story for Hawks' ""The Dawn Patrol."" But as his drinking magnified, the work dried up, Riskin wrote.

The couple had brief glimpses of happiness, but then Wray would catch him drunk or with other women. Saunders would make anti-Semitic, pro-Hitler comments. At a party, he decked actor Herbert Marshall, who had lost a leg in World War I, which played badly in the gossip columns.

Wray became pregnant and they had a daughter, Susan, but it didn't help their relationship.

""John's decline accelerated,"" Riskin wrote. ""His pupils were often enlarged, his eyes vacant, his movements bizarrely slowed.""

When she woke up to find him injecting a drug into her, Wray finally asked for a divorce. He retaliated by selling their house and taking all her money.

As she worked to replenish her bank accounts, he kidnapped their daughter for a couple of months and eventually landed in Charlottesville, Va., where he checked into a hospital for ""a nervous condition"" and had their daughter put in the pediatric unit.

Custody laws favored fathers in Virginia at the time, Riskin wrote, but Wray managed to take Susan back to California and get a divorce. Saunders went for more treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, but finally headed south with a nurse, winding up in Fort Myers.

""For a long time, John had been standing precariously at the abyss,"" Riskin wrote. ""Now he had reached the dark and lonely end of his journey.""

***

Saunders was no stranger to Florida. He did his military training here. And it was front page news when he arrived in Fort Myers in February 1940.

""This is Mr. Saunders' second season at the beach,"" the News-Press reported, ""which he says is the best place he has found for a rest, as well as the quietude he needs for his working hours.""

He apparently kept to himself, preferring long walks and time alone in his cottage. It was the 1940s version of celebrity rehab. But his nurse departed three days before he was found dead on March 11, and he probably shouldn't have been left alone.

After his suicide, rumors about a dissolute lifestyle quickly spread, and the paper followed up with another front page story on March 13: ""Beach Friends Deny 'Wild Tales' About John M. Saunders.""

Local restaurant owners got to know him, including Mrs. Watt Harris, who ran the tea room where he was supposed to show up for breakfast.

""Mr. Saunders was a lovable character,"" Mrs. Harris (no first name given in those days) told the News-Press. ""He was sensitive and nervous and not in good health and insisted on working long hours. Sometimes he drank too much and then hated himself for doing so.""

Harris said Wray called her soon after his death. According to national news accounts at the time, the actress was ""heartbroken,"" and had ""collapsed.""

""He often told me how proud he was of the fine life and happy times he had lived with Miss Wray,"" Harris told the Fort Myers paper. ""I don't know why he wanted to take his life except he was not happy and his work did not make his life complete.

""The only reason I'm saying all this about Mr. Saunders is that some people had spread wild tales,"" she added. ""He may have had too much to drink for his own good but he was always a gentleman.""

Why did he kill himself? Some trace Saunders' problems to the fact that he spent World War I in Florida -- as a flight instructor instead of in heroic combat. A columnist friend claimed that punching actor Marshall had exiled him from Hollywood, and he couldn't bear it. Today, his mood swings and drinking might be diagnosed as a bipolar disorder.

***

Saunders' abbreviated career remains, at best, a footnote in Hollywood history. In the 1920s and early 1930s, though, his name was big enough that it was a selling point in advertisements for his films.

Perhaps his true claim to fame is a gift he unknowingly gave to a young actor.

In 1931, Saunders wrote his only novel, ""Single Lady,"" a Lost Generation tale of a French girl and her soldier pals that critics felt was patterned too closely on Hemingway's writing. It was turned into a Broadway musical called ""Nikki."" Despite Wray as the star, it did about as well as the book, closing after 39 performances.

Her leading man in the show was a former acrobat and vaudeville comic with the curious moniker of Archibald Leach. Saunders had named Leach's character Cary Lockwood.

When Leach went to Hollywood, he needed to change his name to something suitable for a movie star. Fond of Wray and his experience acting with her, he chose the name Cary, then added the last name of Grant. You know the rest.

Until she died at age 96 in 2004, Wray never spoke unkindly about Saunders. When writing her autobiography, she fretted to a New York Times reporter that it was ""unfair"" to expose his weaknesses.

""How can anyone make a judgment on what other people do?'' Wray said in that 1989 interview. ''It's just not possible for me. It's so tragic that John had this theme in his life of living dangerously and dying young.''

In an interview last month with the Los Angeles Times about her memoir, Victoria Riskin said Wray ""didn’t talk a lot about (Saunders) except toward the end of her life. I found in some of her personal notes that she felt she had let him down. She knew she was stronger. She knew she was caring and didn’t find that key to open the door to saving him.

""She felt that she should have been able to help him, and she couldn’t. He was beyond help.""

852,Pink Moon: Lakeland showcase of women's art explores the 'divine feminine',"LAKELAND — The collaboration of an idea, a theme, a painting and a title represented in a simple nude became the focus of conversation as organizers took a break from arranging more than 130 works for an upcoming showcase of women's art, “Pink Moon.”

The painting by Lakeland artist Lauren Dickman presents a nude woman, showing just her torso as she sits, perhaps — there are few clues to give context.

It is not an unfamiliar framing — the component parts of women's bodies isolated from the whole woman have long been commoditized — but the ease of the pose, the warm colors, the natural sag of her breasts and the weight she carries around her midsection present something that feels intimate and honest, like a private moment captured from a woman's perspective.

And then there's the title, “My House,” which for Pink Moon curator Sunny Balliette elevates the message and its connection to the show's overarching theme: the divine feminine. It's a work that invites contemplation.

“Everything portrayed felt deeply feminine, but not contrived,” Balliette said of the pieces selected for the showcase of women artists. “There's some extremely personal pieces.”

A construction by Katherine Langford titled “Cautionary Tales II” is one of these works that are full of depth and complexity. It invites viewers to look into the box, where a picture of a girl wearing red ballet shoes spins. Among the detail on the box is a piece of her mother's wedding dress.

Balliette said she hopes the show helps explore the complexity and inner lives of women. She also said she hopes many men come to the show — she said they've gotten questions.

At first, the organizers weren't sure their showcase of women's art in Lakeland would draw interest from artists, organizer Ileah Green King said. They expected, to some degree, to hope for the best, take what they get and then grow.

But the flood of submissions gave the organizers a new problem: heartbreak. The space available at Art/ifact at 820 N. Massachusetts Ave., a full-time art studio and part-time gallery for events, is relatively modest.

""The first person we said 'no' to — it was the hardest part,"" Green King said. “Who are we to say what 'the divine feminine' is?” But, “we just don't have enough wall space. We had to make some really hard choices.

“We ended up curating it a lot more than we thought we would,” Green King added. “It's exciting to see how much incredible work was created by women in Lakeland. … We want to celebrate all women in all sizes and all packages in all their forms in all of their glory. It was really hard to have to start saying no to pieces. It really sucked.""

The representation of women in the arts is a persistent criticism of the paid art world, and the show, which started as an idea about two years ago, taps into that frustration to some degree, but also hopes to say something about the bounds of art in Lakeland and the limit set in limiting whose family gets included in the definition of “family friendly.”

There are “really great, talented” artists in Lakeland, Green King said, “but Lakeland has this thing that it wants everything to be family friendly and it limits a lot of people, it limits a lot of artists. There are artists in our community who can't communicate because their work isn't, quote-unquote, 'family friendly.' ”

Green King, whose daughter was quietly keeping to herself on a couch in the corner of Art/ifact Saturday while her mother and the other organizers set the stage for Friday's show, said the show is family friendly, but not bowdlerized.

“Bring your kids, but be prepared to have conversations with your kids,” Green King said.

The show is a collaborative project between the Lakeland Women's Collective, the first major event for the nascent organization of which Green King is a founder, and Volume Art Collective, curator Balliette's organization.

The show celebrates multiple media, with painting, photography, sculpture, spoken word, portraiture, a performance piece and music with Lady Moonbeam and Patty Kenoly performing. Gabriela Jaxon, whose colorful, spray paint mural is a recent addition to North Florida Avenue in Lakeland, will also be completing a work-in-progress live. Laura Davis, a photographer (and full disclosure, a Ledger employee), will be taking portraits in front of a wall-filling piece by Kristina Stafford.

Most pieces on display will be for sale.

The evening will end with a “full moon ritual” led by Green King and Alison Foley-Rothrock. Green King said the event is not religious or dogmatic in nature, but ""a non-denominational meditation based on removing the limiting beliefs we hold against ourselves.""

The ritual comes at the end to allow anyone interested in avoiding any connotations to skip out without missing the other parts, she said.

The group is also accepting donations for Hello Flo!, an organization started by Davis, the portrait photographer, which provides emergency period packs for teachers to keep in their classrooms. A donation of a pack of unscented pads, wipes or a small makeup bag to store them will earn the donor a free drink ticket.

855,Columbine survivors send kids to schools altered by attack,"Twenty years after teenage gunmen attacked Columbine High School, Kacey Ruegsegger Johnson and other alumni of the Littleton, Colorado, school have become parents. The emotional toll of the shooting that killed 12 classmates and a teacher has been amplified by fears about their own kids' safety, spiking each time yet another shooter enters yet another school.

DENVER — Dropping her kids off at school used to be the hardest part of Kacey Ruegsegger Johnson's day. She would cry most mornings as they left the car and relied on texted photos from their teachers to make it through the day.

Now, the mother of four — and Columbine shooting survivor — sees mornings as an opportunity. She wakes early, makes breakfast and strives to send a clear message before her kids leave home: I adore you.

Twenty years after teenage gunmen attacked Columbine High School, Ruegsegger Johnson and other alumni of the Littleton, Colorado, school have become parents. The emotional toll of the shooting that killed 12 classmates and a teacher has been amplified by fears about their own kids' safety , spiking each time yet another shooter enters yet another school.

""I'm grateful I have the chance to be a mom. I know some of my classmates weren't given that opportunity,"" Ruegsegger Johnson said, tears springing to her eyes. ""There are parts of the world I wish our kids never had to know about. I wish that there would never be a day I had to tell them the things I've been through.""

As the survivors of Columbine entered adulthood, they watched the attacks at their school and so many others — Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Parkland — alter the American classroom.

Drills teaching students to ""lock down"" inside classrooms became routine. Schools formed teams to assess threats, particularly from students. Security firms forged a multibillion-dollar industry, introducing surveillance video, panic buttons and upgraded doors and locks. And police changed their strategies for responding to a gunman intent only on killing.

Security measures came into play just days before the 20th anniversary of the massacre, when a possible threat Tuesday locked down Columbine and other Denver-area high schools. All students were safe and left their classes, officials later said, adding that the lockdowns were tied to an FBI investigation but didn't provide details.

Some of the Columbine survivors find comfort in students being shielded by high fences or locked doors. Others find themselves frustrated by the ready acceptance of active-shooter drills in schools.

Now, many of these students-turned-parents grapple with crippling fear dwarfing pride as their children walk into their own schools.

Ruegsegger Johnson has developed her own ritual for the school drop-off. On a recent sunny spring morning, she helped her kids find their book bags and tie their shoes before ushering them to the car. She prayed aloud as they neared the school, giving thanks for a beautiful morning and asking for a day of learning and friendship.

As always, she made a silent addition: Keep them safe.

The prospect of Amy Over's 13-year-old daughter starting high school could have triggered a panic attack in the not-too-distant past. But now she's focused on helping the girl prepare for the unexpected.

She coaches her daughter when she ventures to places outside her mom's control: Where is the closest exit? What street are you on? Who is around you?

""I never want my kids to feel an ounce of pain, the way that I felt pain,"" Over said. ""I know that that's something that I can't control. And I think that's hard on me.""

Over was in the Columbine cafeteria when the gunmen approached the school, targeting students eating lunch outside. She escaped with no physical injuries, but has struggled emotionally for years.

Therapy and family support helped. But waving goodbye to her daughter on the first day of preschool triggered a panic attack — the first of many. She was diagnosed with chronic panic disorder, resumed therapy and found new strategies for her life as a mother of two.

Over's daughter, Brie, was 11 when her mother first told her about Columbine, a few days before the anniversary. That April 20, they visited the school for a memorial ceremony that included a reading of the names of the 13 people killed. Afterward, the Overs walked together through the quiet school.

Here is where she hid in the cafeteria, Amy Over showed her daughter. And that is the staircase where she last saw her basketball coach, Dave Sanders, who died in a classroom awaiting rescue after valiantly trying to help evacuate the school.

For Over, opening up to her daughter was cathartic and so they have continued to attend annual memorial events, now imbued with a gentler tone with the girl by her side.

""It's a day of reflection,"" Over said. ""It's a day of love and hope. And I get to share that with my daughter.""

Though it sometimes seems mass shootings inside schools are a commonplace occurrence, they are relatively rare, and statistics show the number has not substantially increased since 2000.

But that is of little consolation to a swath of American parents. About 2 in 10 parents said they are not at all or not very confident in their children's safety while at school, while a third of parents are very or extremely confident, according to a March survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Austin Eubanks, who survived being shot in the Columbine library, is among those who doesn't fear the schools his sons, ages 13 and 9, attend.

Instead, he laments that active-shooter drills, video surveillance and armed guards are all too routine for them — as natural as a tornado drill was for him growing up in Oklahoma.

""We are so unwilling to actually make meaningful progress on eradicating the issue,"" said Eubanks, who remains scarred by watching his best friend, Corey DePooter, die. ""So we're just going to focus on teaching kids to hide better, regardless of the emotional impact that that bears on their life. To me, that's pretty sad.""

Isolation, depression, addiction and suicide are among the larger dangers he sees facing his kids' generation, and he knows firsthand the damage those can cause.

For more than a decade after the attack, Eubanks was addicted to prescription pain medication. He got sober in 2011 and began repairing his family, including his relationship with his sons and their mother. He works at an addiction treatment facility and travels the country telling his story.

At home in Colorado, he tries to help his sons become attuned to pain others may be feeling. He encourages them to talk to an adult when peers seem so angry or afraid that they may need help. He tries to remember that — for them — all of the changes in schools are just normal.

He was horrified by videos that Marjory Stoneman Douglas students shot in Parkland, Florida, as they hid inside a classroom while a gunman moved through the halls of the high school. He has urged his own boys to always try to escape first — whatever it takes — even if the drills advise staying put.

""These are my children, and what I care about most is their safety,"" he said. ""And I know that for them, in a situation like that, getting away from it as quickly as possible is the best likelihood of success.""

When Kacey Ruegsegger Johnson's daughter Mallory was 8, a classmate saw her mom on a Denver news station. Mallory had a question: Was her mother famous?

Ruegsegger Johnson knew it was time for the conversation she and her husband had anticipated for years. During a family vacation, she pulled her oldest daughter aside for a private talk — the one that finally explained the scars marking Ruegsegger Johnson's right shoulder and why she was unable to reach up toward high shelves or use her right arm to lift the kids.

In 1999, Kacey Ruegsegger was reading a magazine in the school library when a teacher entered, shouting that someone had a gun. The junior crouched under a computer desk, pulling a chair in front of her body. She felt well-hidden, but the shooters' taunting voices and the sound of gunshots grew louder and got closer. Then one of the gunmen leaned down and fired a shotgun at her.

The blast shredded her right shoulder. She tried not to move or cry out, praying the shooter would believe she was dead and walk away. When the pair left the library, other students helped her flee.

For the last 20 years, she has lived with post-traumatic stress disorder, along with physical pain. She worked as a nurse until the injuries to her arm forced her to stop.

Ruegsegger Johnson was thrilled to become a mother, but struggled to leave her infant daughter at daycare during church services. She considered home schooling, terrified that sending her children into a school was akin to exposing them to danger.

Leaning on her religious faith and family support, she worked hard to push the terror down as her children got older. She avoided media coverage of school violence and became a resource for other survivors of shootings. She grew tired of living in fear and unwilling to let her past affect her kids' experience.

Though she still struggles occasionally, she resolved to make mornings before school a positive time, focused on building her children up. And she finds at least some comfort in their school's evacuation plans and security measures. She told her children that lockdown drills were like fire drills — practice to keep them safe from an unlikely danger.

But when Mallory confessed to feeling afraid that ""a bad person"" could still find her in the evacuation location used during one drill, Ruegsegger Johnson flashed back to herself crouched under that computer desk in the Columbine library.

""The bad guys found me, and I thought I had a really great hiding spot,"" she said. ""So what am I going to say to a little girl who has that same fear that the bad guy might find her? It was a really hard moment for me.

860,Ohio man gets 15 years for molesting Bunnell girl,"A jury found Michael Craig Bowling, 48, guilty of lewd and lascivious molestation and lewd and lascivious exhibition on Feb. 22 following a week-long trial.

BUNNELL — An Ohio man convicted in February of molesting an underage Bunnell girl was sentenced Friday to 15 years in prison.

A jury found Michael Craig Bowling, 48, guilty of lewd and lascivious molestation and lewd and lascivious exhibition on Feb. 22 following a week-long trial.

Circuit Judge Terence Perkins sentenced Bowling to 15 years for the count of lewd exposure and 55 months, to be served concurrently, for the other charge. Perkins also ordered Bowling to serve 10 years of sexual offender probation after he is released from prison, court documents show.

The charges stem from a game Bowling played with the victim and a friend during a sleepover in a Bunnell home in June 2016. They called the game “7 Minutes of Heaven,” according to an arrest report, and Bowling spent several minutes locked alone in a closet with the victim, exposing himself and committing a sex act.

Investigators found evidence of semen in the closet and DNA testing done by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement determined the semen was Bowling’s.

Investigators asked Bowling if he had gone into a closet — referring to one part of the game — and he said, “Hell, no; I didn’t go in the closet.” He told investigators he remembered the game but said that he didn’t play it, a report said.

Bowling was arrested in Flagler County in December 2017 and has spent the past 16 months behind bars awaiting trials, records show. He was charged with the lewd acts as well as sexual assault tied to allegations he had non-consensual sex with an underage girl for years from the time she was 8.

Bowling was tried for all his alleged sex acts in December, but the jury deadlocked after a weeklong trial and hours of deliberation. His trial in February concentrated on the lewd acts stemming from the “7 Minutes of Heaven” game in 2016.

Bowling is slated to have a court appearance in his case on the remaining charges April 30.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190412/ohio-man-gets-19-years-for-molesting-bunnell-girl?rssfeed=true,2019-04-12T16:15:32Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

A Spring Hill carnival worker accused of plying the teenage daughter of co-workers with alcohol and of having sex with her has been arrested by the Levy County Sheriff’s Office.

Justin F. Benoit, 40, was charged Tuesday with three counts of sexual battery of a minor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, according to a sheriff’s news release.

The seduction began just before Christmas when Benoit reportedly convinced the 16-year-old to run away from her parents at a Palm Beach County carnival and meet him in Central Florida. From there, they went to Levy County and hid for about two weeks, the release states.

Benoit is accused of giving the girl alcohol and sexually battering her. Meanwhile, the girl’s parents used social media to try to find her, including sites frequented by Benoit. He eventually fled and left the girl behind.

She was found after the sheriff’s office was told of the location by Osceola County detectives.

The girl reportedly told deputies she was coerced into drinking alcohol to the point of becoming sick and of engaging in sexual activity with Benoit.

A warrant was issued for Benoit’s arrest, and he was taken into custody in Pasco County.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190412/man-lured-teen-girl-from-carnival-hid-in-levy-deputies-say?rssfeed=true,2019-04-12T10:59:19Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471

SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) - A nanny was arrested for child abuse after a couple came home to find both of their young children with significant bruises.

Sarai Rivera, 25, was arrested for child abuse and booked into the Sarasota County Jail on Tuesday.

Deputies said the 2-year-old boy and 8-month-old girl were admitted to Sarasota Memorial Hospital after their parents returned home from a date and saw bruising on the boy's neck and bruises on the girl's face and under her chin.

When questioned about the bruises, Rivera allegedly told the parents that the boy had thrown a toy at the girl and that the girl had been kissing the boy too hard and gave him a ""hickey"" by accident.

The children later underwent medical examinations at the Child Protection Center in Sarasota.

A forensic nurse told detectives that the bruising under the girl's chin was consistent with an intentional grab and that the bruise on her ear was likely from a grab or a pinch. The boy's bruises were also consistent with a pinch. The injuries were not accidental in nature, the nurse said.

Rivera later told deputies she was adjusting medications to cope with her depression, which sometimes caused her to ""snap"" and become ""irritable."" She also admitted to drinking rum after the couple left for the date and being intoxicated, the affidavit states.

Rivera said the baby started screaming and crying and she couldn't get her to stop, so she grabbed her by the chin out of frustration. Then she whipped her in the face with a towel twice, according to an affidavit.

Rivera said the boy's bruises were from a tickle game they were playing and that she may have pinched him or sucked his neck too hard, deputies said.

Rivera was booked into the Sarasota County Jail on two counts of child abuse. She also met the criteria for a Baker Act, which was completed.",https://www.wfla.com/news/sarasota-county/drunk-nanny-arrested-for-child-abuse-blamed-on-hickey-deputies-say/1917573950,2019-04-11T15:58:38Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

On Saturday, Kaitlyn Edwards was driving north on Salem Church Road in Sneads when she veered off a curve, crashing into a stand of small trees before a large downed pine tree hit her windshield, according to a Florida Highway Patrol report.

The tree is thought to have been knocked down by Hurricane Michael six months ago, according to a post on the Facebook page ""Prayers for Kaitlyn,"" which has generated thousands of comments from well-wishers.

The accident left the girl with a ""catastrophic brain injury."" An April 8 post said she is in a coma-like state, though responds to neurological checks. She's receiving treatment at University of Alabama's neurology unit in Birmingham, including plastic surgeons working to ""address facial fractures"" and a ventilator to help her breathe.

According to the FHP report, the single-vehicle crash was reported at about 11:20 p.m. When first responders arrived about 20 minutes later, Kaitlyn was found in her four-door gold Nissan incapacitated and barely breathing. She was taken by helicopter to Southeast Alabama Medical Center.

The report said it's unknown what distracted her and caused her to run off the road.

Kaitlyn is a junior at Sneads High School. Students at the school gathered at the flagpole to pray for their classmate. The school also is raising funds to help the family with medical costs.

In an email to the Democrat, Kaitlyn's mother Sheila Edwards said her daughter's kindness has ""touched many lives.""

Deputies said they were called March 17 to Goose Prairie Road near Lemon Street after James Reidnauer, 30, and Brent van Besien, 33, shot at the children, who were walking home from a convenience store.

Investigators said the men confronted the children on a trail on property owned by a nearby church.

Michelle Sabb, the victims' mother, told WFTV.com on Wednesday that her children had gone to a BP gas station to buy candy, as they do almost daily.

""There is a path behind all of the homes on this road that all the children take to the bus stop,"" she said. ""The bus stop is in front of the church over here on Goose Prairie (Road), and that's the route they take anywhere.""

Deputies said Reidnauer and van Besien fired at least two shots -- one near the girl's foot and one in the air -- before shouting slurs at the biracial children.

The children, who were uninjured, ran home.

Reidnauer and van Besien said they had thought the children were methamphetamine users, detectives said.

""They were screaming, 'They're shooting at us. They're shooting at us,'"" Sabb said. ""Thank God that they were able to get home, (because) there are a lot of kids (who don't). Trayvon (Martin) -- he didn't make it home. What if my son wouldn't have made it home?""

LARGO — John Jonchuck is guilty of first-degree murder, a jury ruled Tuesday, and should spend the rest of his life in prison for dropping his daughter, Phoebe, off a bridge into the chilly, dark waters of Tampa Bay.

He was not facing the death penalty.

Over more than four weeks, jurors heard a tangled narrative of Jonchuck’s mental history. His public defenders argued that he was insane at the time of the killing, driven by imagined voices and delusions, unaware that what he was doing was wrong. Their case was built on Jonchuck’s recollection of hearing an old Swedish Bible knocking, of listening to Phoebe chanting when she touched it, of thinking she was possessed and that he was the Pope or God.

His rantings did not sway the jury, which ultimately decided that Jonchuck, now 29, knew killing 5-year-old Phoebe was wrong. Prosecutors said he was acting out of vengeance, killing Phoebe so her mother could never get custody of her and because he was bitter that his own mother loved the little girl with affection she never showed for him.

Jonchuck’s mother and uncle both said if he was not insane, he should “rot in hell” for what he did to Phoebe.

“I want to tell him I love him, because he’s my son,” Michele Jonchuck said through tears in a phone interview after the verdict Tuesday. “But when it comes to what he’s done, I hate him. He took my sunshine away.”

The verdict comes four years after the horrific morning of Jan. 8, 2015, when the region awoke to the inconceivable news that a father had dropped his daughter off the Dick Misener Bridge, on the approach to the landmark Sunshine Skyway.

Phoebe loved the color pink, angels and butterflies. Her smiling face was burned into the area’s collective conscience. A makeshift memorial lingers at the edge of the bridge.

Since her death, the prevailing question has gone unanswered: Why?

In rendering a verdict, jurors gave their assumed answer: Evil.

“I am satisfied that justice was done,” said Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney Bernie McCabe. “My immediate reaction is killing children doesn’t make one a very sympathetic character.”

Pinellas-Pasco Public Defender Bob Dillinger did not return a call for comment, though his office is likely to appeal. Craig Whisenhunt, a former public defender turned private attorney who consulted on the case, said that as the verdict was read, Jonchuck’s mind was with two of his public defenders, Jessica Manuele and Jane McNeill.

As they embraced in the courtroom, “John told his attorneys to take care of each other.”

A troubled boy

No one knows what was going through Jonchuck’s mind when he raced to the top of the bridge, scooped his daughter from the back seat, yelled at a police officer — then dropped her into Tampa Bay.

Twelve lay people — seven men and five women — had to decide. They deliberated for 6½ hours.

After the verdict was read, deputies led the jurors out of a side door in the courthouse. Minutes later, in the parking garage, five declined to comment on their decision.

5 KEY MOMENTS IN THE TRIAL

Not guilty by reason of insanity cases are very rare. State numbers show between 2004 and 2018, there were 5,998 murder trials that went to juries in Florida. Of those, 111 ended with a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity — less than 2 percent.

The Jonchuck jurors heard from law enforcement officers and mental health experts, family members and forensic psychiatrists. They looked at autopsy photos and watched video interrogations. They missed a month of work, of reading the news and being on social media.

They learned about a lifetime of struggle, scheming and violence. And a kindergartener who didn’t know how to swim. Who begged to stay with her daddy, the night before he killed her.

Jonchuck had always been troubled and temperamental, desperate for attention and prone to violent outbursts, his friends and family said. His parents split up when he was young, and he spent his childhood bouncing between his dad’s and uncles’ houses. His mother, who used cocaine and spent time in jail, mostly was absent.

During the trial, psychologists said that abandonment left Jonchuck angry and suffering from attachment issues.

He got thrown out of a dozen preschools. He was 5 — Phoebe’s age — when his family started taking him to see a doctor, who prescribed drugs to stabilize his moods. He was 12 the first time he was arrested, for threatening his dad with a butcher knife.

In middle school, Jonchuck was loud and popular; he put on puppet shows in the cafeteria. He often had bruises and black eyes. He told his friends his dad beat him, told them he hated his dad.

Child protective officers investigated Jonchuck’s dad four times, but never arrested him. John Jonchuck Sr. could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

In eighth grade, Jonchuck told everyone he was gay. The next year, he dropped out of school. He was 17 when he climbed on the roof of his dad’s duplex and slit his arm with a knife — a desperate attempt to get out of his house, one psychologist said.

That was the first time his family committed him. By their count, Jonchuck has been Baker Acted 27 times.

Born into strife

In many ways, his life — and Phoebe’s death — show failures in mental health treatment and child protective services. Jonchuck had prescriptions, but couldn’t always afford to fill them, or didn’t want to. When he didn’t have insurance, he stopped going to treatment.

The Department of Children and Families knew about Jonchuck and Phoebe, and were called to check on them multiple times. Both were left in their broken homes.

At 18, Jonchuck was bouncing between friends’ houses, working at a strip club, doing drugs. He drank a lot, smoked pot and spice, used meth so often his fingers were singed from the little glass pipe. Sometimes, the drugs helped him relax, friends said. Other times, they made him mean.

“He was a monster,” his uncle Bryan Morris had said.

Jonchuck was high when he met Michelle Kerr, a buxom blonde who was five years older. He told her she was beautiful. “Maybe,” he said, “I’m not gay.”

He asked her to marry him four times. He enrolled at Hillsborough Community College with her, slit her tires in a jealous rage, threw her mother’s wedding ring out a window. “He’d be as sweet as anything,” Kerr once said. “Then go all Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”

She wouldn’t marry him. But they moved in together, and she got pregnant. They named their daughter Phoebe, after Jonchuck’s chihuahua.

Kerr could not be reached for comment on the verdict Tuesday. She did not appear in court during the trial.

Their relationship was rocky, riddled with drugs and fights. Kerr was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis soon after Phoebe was born, and became unable to drive. So when they split up, Jonchuck said he would take care of their daughter.

Phoebe had long, honey-colored hair that had never been cut. She loved ""Blues Clues,"" thick steaks, books about dogs — and her daddy. When she sat on Santa’s lap, she asked what he wanted for Christmas.

Jonchuck dragged her between friends’ houses, his dad’s duplex, his uncles’ home and his mom’s apartment. He filed injunctions against Kerr, trying to keep her from seeing Phoebe. During the month before he killed his daughter, Jonchuck started worrying that Kerr or his mother would take her from him.

That’s why he went to a custody lawyer that last day, before Phoebe died. He told the lawyer, Genevieve Torres, he was the creator, and asked her to read the Swedish Bible. The lawyer called police and child protective services. A Department of Children and Families hotline worker decided not to send anyone to talk to him.

But deputies responded that afternoon and interviewed Jonchuck at a church where he went begging for a baptism. They decided he was okay, then let him go, with Phoebe.

Hours later, she was dead.

Torres said Tuesday she watched the verdict live on YouTube.

“So glad that justice is finally served for Phoebe,” she later said by phone while coaching a middle school tennis match. “It’s closure for the family and everyone who was touched by this tragedy.”

The St. Petersburg police officer who heard Phoebe scream as she dropped toward the dark water shared the lawyer’s relief.

“I am pleased with the verdict,” William “Drew” Vickers said in a statement, “and am glad to have some closure for Phoebe and her family after four long years.”

Battle over insanity

The jurors’ challenge was to determine whether Jonchuck knew what he was doing when he killed Phoebe, and that it was wrong. They had to hear how the girl fell 62 feet into Tampa Bay. And they had to look at autopsy photos of Phoebe’s pale, bruised body.

No one from Phoebe’s family, or any of Jonchuck’s friends, came to watch the trial. His uncle later said he was sequestered and not allowed to sit in court but wished he could have testified.

Jonchuck’s mother took the stand early, for just minutes, saying Phoebe couldn’t swim. As she left court, she mouthed to her son, “I love you.”

His dad also testified briefly. He said he threw his son out of the house at 18 “because he damaged my house, scared my wife.” Jonchuck was at his dad’s house, with Phoebe, that night he scooped her from her bed, carried her into his Chrysler PT Cruiser and strapped her into her car seat. His dad said he saw them as late as 10:30 p.m., and Jonchuck wasn’t acting particularly strange. He testified that he didn’t hear them leave. In court, he never really looked at his son.

Most of the witnesses were law enforcement officers who saw Jonchuck the night he killed Phoebe. And experts who argued he was either evil or insane.

Prosecutors painted a portrait of an angry, vengeful man who couldn’t hold a job, cooked up money-making schemes and planned to kill his daughter at least a day in advance.

Defense lawyers emphasized how long Jonchuck had been treated for mental health issues, and how he became psychotic before he dropped his daughter, ranting about God and making a sacrifice to save the world.

Both teams of attorneys spent a lot of time debating what witnesses would be allowed to say on the stand. Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Chris Helinger kept sending the jurors out of the courtroom so she could conference with the lawyers.

There were a lot of things the jurors didn’t get to hear — including the word “psychopath.” And a paralegal’s testimony that, on the day before Phoebe died, Jonchuck had told her not to worry about his custody case, saying, “If I can’t have her, then no one else will.”

The judge called that a “killer statement.” But because prosecutors hadn’t told defense attorneys about it, jurors never got to hear it.

Assistant state attorneys Doug Ellis and Paul Bolan brought in a psychologist who said Jonchuck had mental illness, but that he knew what he was doing that night — and that it was wrong. Jonchuck told the officer who watched him carry Phoebe from his car, “You have no free will.” After he let her go, he raced south over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, then made a U-turn to elude police. Both of those actions, psychologist Peter Bursten said, show Jonchuck was sane when he committed the crime.

“A guy who, right up to the murder, has some appreciation of legal boundaries,” the psychologist said. “It doesn’t mean he was not having psychotic symptoms. You can have both.”

Emily Lazarou, a psychiatrist hired by the prosecution, testified that she doesn’t think Jonchuck is even mentally ill, much less insane. She said he couldn’t have bipolar disorder because he took stimulants as a boy, which could bring on bouts of mania.

She thinks Jonchuck was malingering — making things up. And if he really thought both he and his daughter needed to die that night, Lazarou asked, why didn’t he jump, too?

The defense challenged Lazarou vigorously on cross-examination, and contrasted her testimony with their own experts — two psychologists and a psychiatrist — who said Jonchuck was insane when he killed his daughter.

“It is never going to make sense,” Manuele, one of the public defenders, said during her closing argument. “We’ve tried our hardest, we’ve listened to it all. It is insanity.”

The missing voice

Throughout the trial, jurors took notes on yellow legal pads, looked at evidence, asked experts questions.

And they watched Jonchuck, slumped at the defense table in a borrowed dress shirt and tie, rocking, his mouth hanging open. They didn’t know that, two weeks into the trial, his lawyers had told the judge that he was hallucinating again, hearing voices. Or that two psychologists had evaluated him and determined he was competent to continue going to court.

Jonchuck never took the stand. Jurors never heard his voice. Except in videos they watched.

In one, Lazarou asks how he’s feeling. “Kind of sad,” Jonchuck says slowly, his speech slightly slurred. What makes you feel sad? the psychiatrist asks.

In the video, Jonchuck hesitates. He says, sniffling, “Because I was her father and she loved me so much and I always told her I’d never let anything happen to her.

“And I did.”

881,"Seidman: When tragedy strikes, the need for connection","Since Sarah Nevelus's twin brother ended his own life, she has found her greatest solace in being with other teens who have also experienced the death of a loved one.

Sarah Nevelus always thought it was “the coolest thing ever” to be a twin. Though her mother would often say she and her brother, Max, could be each other’s best friend and worst enemy all in the same day, she felt lucky to share a special connection most people will never experience.

After their parents divorced a decade ago and Sarah and Max began living a split life, alternating between two homes every few days, her sibling became the most constant presence in her life. Though Max was reserved and private, she admired his quietly deliberate choices — becoming a regular blood donor, offering unsolicited help to a family friend, teaching himself to play guitar.

So even now, five months after Max, a student at Sarasota Military Academy, took his own life at 17, Sarah, a Pine View senior, says it feels surreal to speak of him in the past tense.

“I still can’t believe he’s gone,” says Sarah, seated beside her father, Mike, with whom she is obviously close (though he teases that “Go away” is her nickname for him). “I do feel like I’m an only child now, and it has been really hard adjusting to that reality. Having a twin was a huge part of my identity, and suddenly not having him here has had a huge effect on how I view myself.”

No one in the family suspected Max was having a hard time, least of all Sarah. The shock of his death ignited conflicting feelings of heartbreak and anger, as well as guilt for not having perceived the pain he was in.

“I didn’t know Max was struggling, and it breaks my heart,” she says. “He kept it hidden, he didn’t show any signs. I didn’t notice any change. But as his twin, I feel like I should have known.”

Less than three weeks after Max’s death, at the urging of her therapist, Sarah entered a room full of children and teens who were, like her, grieving the death of a loved one. She remembers feeling so “raw” at her first visit to Club Blue Butterfly, she couldn’t speak a word. She simply sat, listening, crying.

Near the end of the session, another teen spoke of how she’d followed up after a friend talked about killing herself. Sarah, barely controlling sobs, but feeling compelled to thank the girl, finally spoke about how a similar warning might have altered her brother’s fate.

Club Blue Butterfly — an outgrowth of a creative arts collaboration in 2015 between Tidewell Hospice and Florida Studio Theatre aimed at giving grieving teens an expressive outlet — began last year after a study showed more than 6,500 children under 18 in Sarasota and Manatee Counties had experienced the death of a parent. The twice-monthly peer support groups, part of Tidewell’s Grief Education and Support Center, were recently doubled to accommodate demand.

“We talk a lot about what we can’t do anything about and what we can do to move forward,” says Danielle Visone, a family grief program specialist at Tidewell. “We never say we’re moving on, because we’re not, but we’re healing the heart and moving through the pain.”

At first Sarah eyed Visone with suspicion. Who was this lady, anyway, encouraging them to talk about their “feelings.” But after Visone disclosed she had lost her own father at 18, Sarah’s entire attitude changed.

“No one can understand fully what you’re going through unless they have gone through it themselves,” Sarah says. “The single thing that has been most helpful to me is connecting to people who have also lost someone to suicide. You know there are those people, but it’s easier to feel better when you have a chance to talk with them.”

Each meeting — divided into three age groups, with a separate concurrent group for parents — is structured around a topic and an activity. Recently, Sarah crafted an ominous looking “cloud” made of crumpled gray paper penned with her most negative thoughts. From the cloud dangle tear-shaped raindrops, each representing something positive that has come from the tragedy: “I have a reason to put myself first.” “I now have a story and a desire to help people.”

What doesn’t help her are friends and adults who say things that are rote, trite, or thoughtless. Visone says when her father died, family members urged her not to cry to the point that “I actually thought it wasn’t allowed.” That's just one of the well-meaning but damaging sentiments adults, who often misunderstand a child's grieving process, may convey.

“Kids hate hearing, ‘I’m sorry for your loss,’” says Visone. “They think it’s a useless phrase. Why are you sorry? Did you kill the person? Is that all you can come up with?”

Sarah gets upset when friends suggest it’s time for her to “move on,” when they thoughtlessly say, as teens sometimes do, that they want to “kill themselves” over silly mistakes, or when they suggest, “It’ll get better.”

“It will not get better,"" she says. ""I’m never going to get him back. It’s always going to break my heart and that I have to live with this for the rest of my life is a lot to handle, because my life is just getting started.”

But when she starts college across the state, next fall, she will take with her the lessons and the leadership she has gained as the oldest Club Butterfly participant. Though she wasn’t sure of her career path before Max’s death, she’s now considering neuropsychology and plans to become a suicide prevention advocate. The group, she says, provided her with something her parents, her friends and even her individual therapy sessions couldn’t, something anyone struggling and traumatized — whether by the death of a loved one, a mental illness or social isolation — so badly needs: to feel they are not alone.

“Connection is a basic human need, and its importance is heightened after experiencing such a profound loss,” Sarah says. “It’s really helpful to be with others who are in similar situations and feeling the same way. It’s such a relief to know you’re not the only one in pain.”

882,Tampa Holocaust survivor liberated from Bergen-Belsen 74 years ago,"- She was defined by only a number. Her body was covered in lice and she hadn’t eaten in days. She had come face-to-face with one of the Nazi's cruelest SS officers, Josef Mengele, but was spared his torture.

Helen Borenstein says she weighed around 65 pounds when British soldiers liberated the concentration camp where she was held captive. Bergen-Belsen was liberated 74 years ago, April 15, 1945.

Borenstein, who now lives in Sarasota, Florida, says if the allies came a few days later, she would have been dead.

“I wouldn’t be alive. Nobody would be alive,” she told FOX 13's Jennifer Holton.

The tattoo is still visible - ""A-21498,"" she read aloud from her forearm.

The 22-year-old had spent the last several weeks in the northern Germany Nazi death camp Bergen-Belsen.

Anne Frank and her sister, Margot, died in the same barracks. Helen was there at the same time.

“It was very hard,” Borenstein said. “We had no food, they didn’t feed us. I weighed maybe 65 pounds. Everybody had lice and the lice carried typhus.”

A Polish Jew, Borenstein had survived six other concentration camps, including Auschwitz. Her older sisters were sent to other camps. Her father was sent to work hard labor. She remembers the last time she saw her mother.

“We were standing by a fountain and she said, 'I think this is it. I don’t think we will see each other anymore,” Borenstein recalled.

That night, she was separated from her mother, who was eventually taken to a concentration camp and was killed in one of the gas chambers.

“I never forget the screams that we heard,” she said. “I don’t know how far it was but the whole night, such terrible screams.”

By the time Borenstein arrived at Belsen, the number of prisoners had soared to 22,000. Hundreds were dying every day from typhus and dysentery and food was scarce. She says she hid what bread she had.

“I carried the food underneath my jacket,” she said.

Borenstein slept on the cold barrack’s floor.

“On the ground,” she said. “There was a sweet little girl laying, I think she had typhus. When I woke up, she was dead. She had a good coat. And I took off her coat to have it for myself.”

The dead were not carried away, anymore. They were piled high, in the tens of thousands.

“There were mountains as high as the fourth floor,” she said.

Then came the morning of April 15. Someone came running to her barracks shouting that the Germans were no longer in their watchtowers.

“I ran out and I see everybody running to a building,” she said.

Inside, were piles of potatoes.

“If you saw a wild animal, that’s how the people ran in and grabbed the potatoes, with the skin. Everybody was starved,” she said.

The British soldiers had arrived to liberate the camp. Borenstein clung to life.

“I was so skinny, you wouldn’t have needed an X-ray,” she said. “You could see everything through.”

Decades later, she never removed Auschwitz’s tattoo. She says her friends had theirs removed, but she didn’t like the way it looks afterward, so she decided to keep hers.

“I didn’t need it [removed],” she said.

It inked her place in one of the 20th century’s most defining events, but this survivor refuses to let it define her.

When the British liberated Bergen-Belsen, they found around 60,000 prisoners in the camp, most of them seriously ill. More than 13,000 former prisoners died from their illnesses after liberation.

885,Collier County teacher to run first Boston Marathon to raise money for cancer research,"CLOSE American Desi Linden won the famed Marathon with a time of 2:39:54. USA TODAY Sports

Darlene Crete grew up close to Boston, and Monday morning the Collier County teacher will have a whole new view of the city to support a cause close to her heart.

The Rye, New Hampshire native will be part of a strong Southwest Florida contingent tackling the 123rd annual Boston Marathon.

She will be running for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a comprehensive cancer treatment and research center headquartered in Boston. This year marks the 30th annual Dana-Farber Marathon Challenge where 100% of the money raised goes to Dana-Farber’s Claudia Adams Barr Program in Innovative Basic Cancer Research. The Marathon Challenge has raised nearly $93 million to date.

Crete, 56, is running for a number of people on Monday, including her father. Andy Crete has survived two bouts of lung cancer in the last 6½ years and is now cancer free. She's also honoring her best friend, Sue Piper, who lost her battle with invasive metastatic breast cancer in 2005, and friend Fred St. Laurent.

""(Sue) was a loving, spirited and kind soul who lit up the lives of those she touched,"" said Crete, who has been a Collier County teacher since 2004 and was a Golden Apple winner in 2012 for Lorenzo Walker Technical High. ""A true angel on Earth. I'm honored to have shared a part of this life with her and I know she'll be with me every step of the way.

""Fred was diagnosed with stage four kidney cancer 3½ years ago and continues to fight to beat the odds every day,"" Crete added. ""He's an inspiration and will be on my race card on Monday.""

Darlene's sister, Tara, couldn't be more excited for her running Boston.

""I'm really proud of her,"" she said. ""This one is the most meaningful for her, growing up 45 minutes outside of Boston in New Hampshire. A lot of people in her life have been touched by cancer. She's a very strong-minded person.""

This will be Crete's first Boston Marathon, but her eighth marathon overall. She ran her first in 2012, just prior to her 50th birthday. She ranks this one above all others.

""Boston is the marathon of all marathons, and a dream come true for me. I'm a New England girl at heart, being born and raised in New Hampshire, so this has special meaning for me,"" Crete said. ""After the terrible events at the 2013 Boston Marathon, I've been on a mission to one day be there in remembrance of all those who were killed or injured.""

Two brothers planted homemade pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the 2013 race that killed three and injured approximately 260.

Monday's forecast calls for an 80% chance of rain, but Crete remains optimistic the weather will improve.

""The rain, cold and wind is a bit threatening to me because I've seen and read accounts of last year's race,"" Crete said. ""I'm hopeful the forecast will change a bit in our favor. If not, I can't control the weather, only how I react to and embrace it. I'm prepared with all I need to stay as dry as possible and to stay warm.""

887,"179 days after Hurricane Michael, Marianna woman witnesses 'one tragedy after another'","CLOSE Marianna, Fla. homes are difficult to spot amongst the trees uprooted by Hurricane Michael on Friday, Oct. 12, 2018. Tallahassee Democrat

About this project: Half a year after Hurricane Michael, the Tallahassee Democrat asked residents of towns throughout the Big Bend to share stories of their communities post-Michael and tell their experiences and hopes in first-hand reflections.​​​​​

Ali Wiggins (Photo: Special to the Democrat)

MARIANNA, Fla. — When I last wrote, I was still in shock from the devastation Hurricane Michael brought to the Florida Panhandle. It was 15 days after the storm and we were literally trying to figure out which end was up. Today is Day 179.

I wanted to be able to tell you how far we’ve come in the past six months, but sadly I can’t. We have had hundreds of tragedies and events that have occurred as a result of this storm that have set us back — and so many of them have changed our lives forever.

Ali's original column: This is Day 15 after Hurricane Michael in Jackson County: No birds, ant bites, anger, hope

We all know the national news and media has the attention span of a toddler. We are no longer in the national news. We have been completely forgotten. We have been replaced with topics like an avocado shortage, of all things. The rest of the world has gone on with their lives. We are trying, don’t get me wrong. But the battles we have faced since Oct. 10 are completely unbelievable.

Just one tragedy after another.

Deaths that I firmly believe would never have happened, but for Michael. A coach and his wife electrocuted working on a scoreboard for their local school. My neighbor was crushed by a tree he was cutting down in his yard. Suicides, two that I know of. Three linemen working to get our power back on were killed by the side of the road by a drunk driver. A man was crushed by his tractor trying to clear his land.

I could go on and on. Heartbreaking.

As of today, 31 million cubic yards of debris have been picked up from Michael. And they are still picking it up. Only 3 million cubic yards of debris were picked up after Hurricane Irma. This is basically just fatwood laying on the ground and after six months of it drying out, it was bound to catch on fire. Last week, the Panama City area had a wildfire that burned 668 acres. Folks who survived the hurricane now have lost their home to fire. Blue tarps on their roofs and a wildfire at their back doors. Michael is still among us.

The foundations on our homes are settling and shifting and slipping. My momma’s roof caved in this past week. Rain came flooding into her Florida room because the foundation had started to slip and it basically separated that room from all the rest of her house. My best friend had to vacate her home just last month because her foundation cracked from one side to the other and water was coming up through the tile floor. Her mother is sick and the mold is growing. She had to empty her home of 45 years and find another place to live with a 48-hour notice. My friends who live on the river have been run out of their homes because of flooding. All the debris in the river keeps that water from flowing on down to the Gulf. Michael is still among us.

Tent cities are still here and growing in north Florida. Shelley Summers is a lady in Panama City I would love to meet one day. I hear she has 50 people living in her backyard and she has another 18 more headed her way. Homeless numbers are at an all-time high. The police just last week discovered an abandoned assisted living facility where 17 people were living. If you can find a place to rent, you'll becharged three times what they should. No one can afford that. Unemployment is up. Not because there are no jobs, but because the people who are coming to work have no place to live. Michael is still among us.

Homeowners’ insurance policies are being cancelled. And if you settled already from the hurricane damage, but are in limbo waiting for the roofer or the contractor to get to you, and more damage takes place, who pays for that? There aren’t enough contractors and roofers, who are licensed, to get anything done fast enough. To date, more than 50 people have been arrested for working without a license. Scam artists everywhere. People from all over are calling us trying to buy property. Quit calling! We ain’t selling! Michael is still among us.

More: Six months after Hurricane Michael, a housing crisis for survivors with disabilities

We are currently in a mental health crisis. Depression here is so widespread. And why wouldn’t it be? We are living in what feels like a post-apocalyptic world. Mental illness and its treatment cannot be overlooked at a time like this. I am a strong advocate for those battling mental illness and their treatment cannot wait. I have had two friends lose their battle with depression since this storm hit. That is two too many. Michael is still among us.

The most recent tragedy from this storm came this weekend. A young lady was in a horrible car accident. A pine tree downed by Michael came through her windshield during an accident, hitting her in the head and leaving her with what doctors are calling a catastrophic brain injury. If you are a praying person, please send one up for Ms. Kaitlyn.

Back story: Sneads prays for 'bright, spirited' girl after collision with Hurricane Michael-downed tree

I absolutely believe in the power of prayer and she and her family need us all to pray for her recovery. We have been pushed to our limits here.

The “Forgotten Coast” has truthfully been forgotten. We feel abandoned, tired, mad and on some days, we feel hopeless. But then the sun rises again, and we get back to work rebuilding.

MARIANNA AFTER MICHAEL

It’s frustrating, heartbreaking and exhausting. Dealing with the aftermath of Michael has left us all overwhelmed. Things will never be the same here. I feel as though I am going through a grieving process. The initial shock, the sadness, anger, acceptance and finally, learning to live with what we have left.

Please pray for us all. The folks in the Panhandle are not OK and all we know to ask for now are prayers as we try to piece back together our towns and communities.

If you want a real glimpse into our world here, just read the door that opens into our world.

This door brought contractor Brandon Miles to tears when he ran into it while bidding on a demolition job. “This to me was so powerful in capturing the true heartbreak in what our neighbors here in the panhandle have been and are still enduring. My heart still hurts for everyone affected from this storm.” (Photo: Special to the Democrat | Brandon Miles)

888,Man accused of killing childhood friends to appear in court Monday,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - A Miami Gardens fugitive, who is wanted for killing two childhood friends he accused of bullying, is awaiting extradition Friday night at the Vernon C. Bain Center, an 800-bed jail in the Bronx.

Javani Stewart, who is facing charges in Miami-Dade County, walked into the New York City Police Department's precinct in the Bronx Tuesday night to ask for help with housing, police said. He ended up confessing to the killings and to hiding the gun in an abandoned building near the murder scene.

Miami Gardens Police Officer Sean Horne, the lead detective in the case, believes Stewart shot his two friends at point-blank range. A witness told officers late last year Stewart feared that they were going to kill him over ongoing conflicts related to an illegal business venture involving mobile phones.

""The subject shot the victims while seated in the rear seat of the vehicle,"" Carolyn Frazer, a spokesperson for the Miami Gardens Police Department, said in a statement Friday.

Stewart appeared at the Bronx Supreme Court Wednesday, and he is scheduled to appear in court there again on Monday.

Stewart, a 23-year-old Jamaican, will be extradited to Miami-Dade County to face two counts of second-degree murder in the shooting deaths of Donald Leonard Armstrong III and Stephen Luther Campbell, who was the father of a girl and two boys.

The two men, both 23 years old, were shot June 23 inside a sport utility vehicle that ended up under the Palmetto Expressway, near the intersection of Northwest 27th Avenue and Northwest 167th Street. Campbell was dead. Armstrong was pronounced dead at the hospital.

A witness told detectives they saw a man who looked like Stewart get out of the car and run northbound on Northwest 27th Avenue after the gunshots. Aside from his confession to NYPD officers, Stewart allegedly confessed to a witness who told police officers he feared they were going to kill him.

890,Cape Coral man faces 15 years in child solicitation sting after Thursday conviction,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Lee County on news-press.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

A jury convicted a Cape Coral man this week for soliciting a child in a 2018 sting that netted 17 others.

Joseph F. Mainini, 28, was charged with traveling to meet a minor and unlawful use of a two-way communications device. The 20th Judicial Circuit trial took two days and the jury announced its decision Thursday, according to the State Attorney's Office.

According to the State Attorney, in May 2018 Mainini communicated with a person he believed to be a 14-year-old girl through text messages and phone apps called MeetMe and Skout.

Mainini was actually communicating with undercover personnel with the Lee County Sheriff’s Office as part of Operation Picket Fence. He went to the address provided by the person he thought was a child with the intention of engaging in sexual activity. Deputies arrested him there.

He has remained in Lee County Jail since May 18, with no bond set.

Mainini’s sentencing is set for May 13. He faces up to 15 years in prison.

Cape Coral residents accounted for seven of the 18 men arrested in the five-day sting in May.

The others are Anthony Valdes, 35; Chance Butner, 24; Nicholas Porreca, 43; Carlos Canela, 43; James Depasquale, 30; and Paul Newport.

Newport, 51, was one of three arrested who were on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Sexual Offender/Predator System online search site.

He faces nine charges in the sting and remains in Lee County Jail with no bond.

In December 2016, Newport was found guilty of traveling to meet a minor to commit an unlawful sexual offense, News-Press files indicate. An arrest report said Newport had used the Grindr online dating site to arrange to meet a presumed 14-year-old boy.

He was arrested after driving from Cape Coral to an arranged meeting site in Lee County where undercover officers were waiting.

891,Melbourne child with rare disease gets her 'Wish' by hanging with pro softball star,"Just 4-foot-4 and 60 pounds, Brookelynn Dolin attacks softball pitches with the same ferocity in which she has fought off life-threatening maladies for the past five years.

Blasting pitch after pitch inside the batting cage at the Upper Deck Sports Facility in Suntree, she smiles after learning how to ""slap-hit,"" to keep the defense off-guard.

Thanks to the Kids Wish Network, the 10-year-old from Melbourne had an extra-special afternoon earlier this week when her ""wish"" was granted, spending time with her favorite professional softball player, Alex Powers.

""Brookelynn is a rock star, to see how she's handled what's she's gone through, and her passion for softball,"" said Powers, a former Eau Gallie High and Florida State University star who plays for the reigning National Pro Fastpitch champion USSSA Pride in Viera.

""We all go through adversities, but when it happens to someone so young ... sure, it's emotional.""

Heating up: Pride's Powers heats up for softball's most powerful team

Brookelynn has a lifelong diagnosis of Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) a rare, but complex, life-threatening autoimmune disease of childhood, affecting muscles and skin. Her mom, Ashley, says she requires infusions every eight weeks (""by that time, she runs down""), a weekly injection and another shot every three weeks.

""It's a 3-in-a-million disease, normally affecting older people,"" Ashley said. ""We find not a lot of doctors have even heard of it.""

Since that diagnosis, medical experts also have discovered other mono-syllabic conditions affecting Brookelynn, such as sclerodoma, autoimmune thyroid and Sjogren's syndrome, affecting hardening of the skin, sun sensitivity, and the mucus membrane.

""We let her play, but we have to keep her out of the sun as much as possible, and it's important to keep her hydrated,"" her mom said.

Steroids helped raise her weight as much as 30 pounds at one point, her mom said, but getting her off medications obviously is the ultimate goal.

Ashley said, at first, Brookelynn was confined to a medical stroller, but ""once she picked up a bat ... We no longer have to have physical therapy because this keeps her active. And the bonds she has made with her teammates ... I mean, she's been better than ever. It's really like softball has saved her life.""

""It's fun,"" Brookelynn said, ""and it keeps me active and moving.""

Her goal: ""To become an amazing pitcher,"" she said.

Tuesday, Brookelynn swatted softball pitches from Upper Deck owner Jason Stidham and later exchanged gifts and hugs with him and Powers, who gave her a stack of season tickets, a visor, a Pride jacket and an authentic No. 11 pregame jersey, the same number, coincidentally, that Brookelynn wears on her softball teams.

""I picked that number because my uncle had worn it,"" said Brookelynn, ""and now, Alex wears it.""

Powers, 24, met Brookelynn a few years ago at a softball clinic and has followed her treatment and softball exploits ever since on social media.

Stidham, who played baseball at Melbourne High, Florida State and in the St. Louis Cardinals organization, is not only impressed with Brookelynn's fighting spirit but her sportsmanship as well.

""She's attended one of our camps, and she's the same girl ... nobody even knew (of her conditions),"" Stidham said. ""She's such a great teammate, helping others get better.""

The Kids Wish Network ""is a charitable organization that grants once-in-a-lifetime wishes for children with life-threatening illnesses,"" said Brent Lewis, a spokesman with the group, based in Holiday, on Florida's west coast. ""This is a great heart-warming story and a very deserving Wish Kid.""

Spending an afternoon in the batting cage and getting a TV interview alongside her softball idol was special for Brookelynn. But it also was a special day for her mom, her dad Joshua and her little brother Grayson, who all watched with admiration.

""Knowing that Alex is here giving back, playing here where she grew up, and showing girls that softball doesn't have to end in college is a great motivator,"" Ashley said.

Powers, a former all-state shortstop in high school and now a first baseman who overcame some obstacles herself with double knee surgeries, not only won the Atlantic Coast Conference Scholar-Athlete of the Year award in 2017 but also is in her third year as a pro with the No. 1 team in America.

She now knows she has a true fan forever.

""This is so encouraging to me,"" Powers said. ""So eye-opening and humbling. I just wonder how much more she has to endure. I mean, look at her, she's so full of life.""

892,"Police fine teen for reporting ex-boyfriend, then he killed her","SUSSEX, ENGLAND - Three officers will face disciplinary action after they fined a teen girl for ""wasting police time"" for reporting her ex-boyfriend's threats.

The 19-year-old girl was later killed by the man after he slit her throat.

Shana Grice had reported Michael Lane five times to police in Sussex, England during a six month period beginning in February 2016, according to The Guardian.

In March 2016, Lane pulled Grice's hair and stole her phone after chasing her down a street. After filing another report, police fined her $100 for wasting their time and released Lane without charges. In July 2016, Lane was only cautioned by police after he stole Grice's house key.

Just a month later, on August 25, Lane, who had put a tracker on Grice's car, killed the teen.

“Our daughter took her concerns to the police and instead of being protected was treated like a criminal,” said Shana's parents, Sharon Grice and Richard Green. “She paid for the police’s lack of training, care and poor attitude with her life. It’s only right that the police make changes, but it’s too little, too late for Shana.”

An investigation revealed the officers levied the fine because they were upset Grice failed to tell them she was previously involved in a relationship with Lane.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct said Tuesday that two of the officers will face gross misconduct proceedings, while another will has already taken part in internal misconduct proceedings.

It was later revealed that 13 other women had reported Lane for stalking, The Independent reports.

893,Navarre girl a superhero in fight against cancer,"NAVARRE — Melissa Joyner stares intently at her parents as they describe the rare Acute T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma she contracted as a 13-month-old.

Now a 10-year-old who attends the fifth grade at Holley Navarre Intermediate, she wants to learn her cancer survival story.

Every once in a while Melissa pipes in and her dad, Adam Joyner, and mom, Moona Joyner, gently explain to her what happened. The rare cancer accounts for about 2 percent of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

Melissa describes the emotions that run through her as she listens to her parents: “Interesting. Emotional. Happiness that I’m alive.”

She and her family look forward to the Navarre Relay for Life scheduled from 6 p.m.-midnight Friday at Navarre High School.

“It’s nice to help prevent what I’ve gone through,” said Melissa, who pushed her family to join her in the Relay as a family project.

Relay for Life, which began in 1985, has become the largest annual not-for-profit fundraising event in the world. More than 5,200 communities in the United States and 20 countries do the cancer walk that benefits the American Cancer Society.

Melissa embodies a survivor. Besides cancer, she was born two months early and at six months developed Auditory Neuropathy that made her deaf. She gradually could hear again but, today, still wears hearing aids.

From six months on, Adam and Moona knew their baby had a health issue.

“She had sweaty feet. She was a sweaty baby,” Moona said.

They finally received confirmation when Melissa reached her first birthday and could barely breathe. Their baby had Pleural Infusion, which means fluid filled up her chest cavity. Doctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, drained the fluid and tested it. Melissa had Stage 3 Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, doctors told her parents on Sept. 11, 2009.

“It was hard dealing with it,” said Adam, a retired Master Sgt. in the U.S. Air Force. “There were so many lines — eight or 10 lines — in her.”

For the next two years, she would receive chemotherapy, some so toxic they could have killed her. Melissa developed a norovirus that causes diarrhea and vomiting. Adam and Moona put a new diaper, sometimes two, on Melissa about every hour.

Then, she contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome, a serious disorder that attacks the nerves. It turned baby Melissa into a quadriplegic.

Moona can joke about it now. “She was a floppy dolly,” she said.

Adam added that every one of the families with children suffering from cancer supported each other.

“When that happened, everyone felt sorry for us,” Adam said. “That addition added up to being too much.”

Doctors told Melissa’s parents she would never walk. But she sat on a toy giraffe with wheels and learned to walk again.

Today, she runs up and down the field playing soccer. She has a 2-year-old sister, Mia, who she squeezes tight in a hug. Melissa also plays piano and sings in her school’s choir. Her favorite color is sky blue/aqua, the color of her bedroom. Her favorite princess is Penelope from “Wreck it Ralph.” She likes to eat at Tijuana Flats and The Slippery Mermaid Sushi Bar. When she grows up she wants to be a TV news reporter.

After beating cancer, Melissa received a Make-A-Wish Foundation trip to Disney World in Orlando, where she met Disney princesses and got their autographs. She has a photo album she likes to pull out. Plus, her dad, Adam, briefly flew a jet over the park, which normally is closed to air traffic.

In Sandringham, England, she talked to both Queen Elizabeth and Princesses Kate during a Christmas visit in 2011. Photos of their visit appeared in news media around the globe.

Adam and Moona finally let themselves cry after they were told Melissa was in remission in September 2011. They still get emotional talking about the struggle.

Friday, Melissa and her mother will walk in the Navarre Relay for Life as part of Gold Together.

895,Her idea. Her movie. Marsai Martin’s ‘black girl magic’ blew away her fellow ‘Little’ producer,"CLOSE From the producers of ""Girls Trip,"" ""Little"" shows a business mogul trapped in her 13-year-old body. USA TODAY

When FAMU graduate and producer Will Packer was 14-years-old, the movie ""Big"" debuted. When Marsai Martin was the same age, she was executive producer and lead actress in a Hollywood movie inspired by that 1988 film.

""She is somebody who is very grounded, has a very strong sense of self,"" Packer told Sway's Universe SiriusXM program. ""I didn't have that at my age.""

The 14-year-old known for her role on the ABC sitcom ""Black-ish,"" recently became the youngest Hollywood executive producer ever with the release of ""Little."" When she came up with the idea as a 10-year-old and shared it with Will Packer, he said she was already acting out scenes she had developed in her head.

""She had this vision for this movie. She already knew she wanted Regina Hall to be the actress that played her as an adult,"" Packer told xoNecole.com. ""This is actual, real, black girl magic.""

Jordan Sanders (Marsai Martin) and April Williams (Issa Rae) try to figure out how Jordan got so ""Little."" (Photo: Eli Joshua Ade)

The idea was for reverse the plot of the movie ""Big,"" so instead of a boy in a man's body, Martin portrays a woman in a girl's body. The role required maturity because it needed her to act and speak like a person beyond her years in scenes alongside Issa Rae and Justin Hartley. Packer, who's also a producer on the film, said he talked to her about how she wanted to pull that off while making it accessible to more than just adults.

""What she said was 'I don't want to make it soft. I don't want to make a movie that doesn't feel real to my generation,' "" Packer said. ""It has the sensibility of today's teens, and Marsai helped with that.""

Will Packer movies have grossed $800 million and counting: How he grew up and how he got here

Packer's career in film didn't start until he arrived at FAMU. He and fellow graduate Rob Hardy put out an independent movie called ""Chocolate City"" during their time at the university, to little fanfare. Since then, he's produced blockbusters like ""Stomp the Yard,"" ""Straight Outta Compton,"" ""Girls Trip.""

""Whenever you are doing something for the first time, you are always going to run into challenges that seem insurmountable. But we got past it,"" Packer said at an event celebrating the 25th anniversary of the release of ""Chocolate City"". ""That early success still drives me when I encounter challenges in my career today.""

Those same messages have no doubt been passed onto Martin, who's grateful to both Packer and fellow producer Tracy Y. Wilson.

""It feels very important to me because they did listen to my story,"" Martin said at the film's premiere in Atlanta.

Unlike many child stars who may not go onto have a successful Hollywood career in adulthood, Packer sees a very bright future for Martin.

""Some people have an innate ability, a skill set that is undeniable,"" Packer said. ""She is going to be somebody we're going to be talking about for a long time.""

""Little"" opens at Tallahassee theaters on April 12.

Police say 25-year-old Richard Brown hired an Uber to drive the 17-year-old girl from Texas to his home in Apopka. According to investigators, he told the victim he was ""Instagram Famous"" and would take care of her.

Officers say the teen wasn't allowed to leave the home after being sexually battered over a three-day period. She was able to escape and call 911.

Brown told investigators he paid $822 to hire an Uber, but he indicated that he never had any type of sexual contact with her and thought she was 18.

PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. - PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - John Jonchuck is accused of dropping his 5-year-old daughter Phoebe to her death off the Dick Misener Bridge near the Sunshine Skyway in St. Petersburg four years ago. Jonchuck's defense attorneys are trying to prove that he was insane when he killed his daughter. So far jurors have deliberated for three hours. They'll continue this morning at 9 a.m.

News Channel 8 has been in the courtroom every day for the trial. Here's what's happened so far.

DAY 15:

News Channel 8 is officially on verdict watch in the John Jonchuck murder trial. The jury began deliberations around 4:30 p.m. They decided to call it quits for the day before 7 p.m.

Before deliberations began, the jury heard closing arguments from state prosecutors and defense attorneys.

Each side had two hours to deliver their arguments. The state split its time.

State prosecutors began with their closing arguments. After the defense team delivered their closing arguments, state prosecutors had time to deliver a rebuttal.

After closing arguments wrapped, the judge read instructions to the jury and sent them to deliberate. The judge previously said jurors would be able to stay as long as they like or can choose to go home and come back Tuesday morning.

Deliberations are set to continue at 9 a.m. Tuesday.

DAY 14:

The defense rested its case on Friday in the John Jonchuck murder trial. The judge scheduled closing arguments for Monday morning.

Before the defense rested, jurors heard from Heather Davis, a counselor at the North Florida Evaluation and Treatment Center. Davis went over Jonchuck's medications and said he was having hallucinations at the hospital that included seeing dinosaurs in the parking lot.

Davis also testified saying she heard Dr. Emily Lazarou say ""she didn't need to evaluate him to know he didn't have a mental illness.""

Dr. Michael Maher was also called back to the stand. He answered questions from the defense and the state before taking questions from the jury.

DAY 13:

Dr. Emily Lazarou was back on the stand Thursday morning to continue her testimony.

Defense attorney Jessica Manuele brought up concerns about how Dr. Lazarou was dressed during a taped interview with Jonchuck at a mental hospital. Judge Helinger responded swiftly to shut down the argument.

""Let me say this - a woman's choice of attire, their hairstyle, all of that stuff I don't think is really relevant to anything,"" she said. ""I'm not gonna let her be attacked for her dress.""

The jury went on to watch the taped interview between Dr. Lazarou and Jonchuck.

The defense continued trying to poke holes in Dr. Lazarou's testimony throughout the day. They claim she wouldn't let Jonchuck finish his statements or wouldn't give him a chance to respond.

""He's responding to the question that I'm asking but in very short answers,"" Lazarou said. ""That whole interaction there, that's not how these interactions typically go.""

Attorneys also questioned Dr. Lazarou about her hours on the case, her qualifications and other defendants she's interviewed who were deemed incompetent.

At one point while Manuele was questioning her about her qualifications, Dr. Lazarou became emotional and broke into tears on the stand. She says she was not allowed to take an exam at one point during her career because she was breastfeeding at the time.

""(You are) involved in a lawsuit in which you are suing the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, correct?"" Manuele asked.

Dr. Lazarou clarified that she is a named plaintiff in the lawsuit.

""What I was asking for was for them to accommodate pregnant and breastfeeding women,"" she said. ""That was the reason for my complaint because they would not allow me to sit for the boards because they would not make an accommodation for me breastfeeding.""

DAY 12 RECAP:

The defense fought to keep Dr. Emily Lazarou's testimony out of court because they claim it's changed since her deposition before trial. She doesn't consider him to be mentally ill but says he has personality disorders.

Dr. Lazarou says Jonchuck is malingering psychotic symptoms, or exaggerating an illness he doesn't have. She ruled out Jonchuck having bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. She also claims his delusions were out of character for a psychotic patient.

The judge eventually decided to allow Dr. Lazarou to testify in front of the jury.

Before her testimony in front of the jury began, there was some drama with the jurors. One juror said they heard two people that looked like lawyers making jokes about the judge's appearance and Jonchuck's last name in the lunchroom and said it was very unprofessional.

That juror then told a second juror about the comments. The second juror was brought in to be questioned. Eventually, all of the jurors were brought in because everyone knew about the conversation. The judge asked all of the jurors if the comments would impact their judgment on the trial. All of the jurors responded that it would not.

Dr. Lazarou is due back on the stand at 9 a.m. Thursday.

DAY 11 RECAP:

Dr. Peter Bursten testified for a second day on the stand in the John Jonchuck murder trial. On Tuesday, he went over the PCL-R - a psychopathy checklist used to determine Jonchuck's mental state.

Bursten said Jonchuck fit a majority of the criteria and was experiencing various mental stages when he killed Phoebe in 2015.

""It would be easy to say all of those psychotic systems were present and therefore Mr. Jonchuck, because those symptoms were present, he had to be legally insane,"" Bursten said. ""Symptoms can be present but there are other variables present - again the presence of personality disorders, history of aggression, history of other anti-social types of behaviors.""

He described Jonchuck like a teapot - that his brain was starting to unravel.

""He believed, or he told myself and two other doctors that he had believed, he had engaged that behavior to save the world. He told one doctor he was God. Told me the devil was talking to him,"" said Bursten.

Bursten testified that Jonchuck had a sense of what was going on while on the bridge with Phoebe and police.

""He knew what he was doing and I believe he was telling the police officer, I'm gonna do what I'm going to do. You have no free will, stop me,"" said Dr. Bursten. ""So, I'm seeing a pattern here of a guy right up to the murder who has some appreciation of legal boundaries and legality or the illegal aspect of this behavior.""

Jurors will return Wednesday at 11 a.m. but attorneys will argue at 9 a.m.

DAY 10 RECAP:

Things became pretty heated in the courtroom in day 10 of testimony in the John Jonchuck murder trial.

Jonchuck's attorneys said allowing some of psychologist Dr. Peter Bursten's testimony into court would paint a negative picture for the jurors.

Bursten is the state's rebuttal witness. He evaluated Jonchuck after the murder of Phoebe and also spoke to Jonchuck's close friends and family.

Jonchuck's attorneys went back and forth with Judge Chris Helinger about using words like psychopathy and psychotic features to discuss his mental state.

His defense also objected to Dr. Bursten telling a story about a time when Jonchuck was 17 years old and put slippery polish on the staircase, which caused his uncle to fall and injure himself. The uncle claimed it was intentional at the time.

""Fell down the stairs and broke his rib and his arm,"" said Dr. Bursten.

""Was the defendant present for that? What was his reaction?"" asked prosecutor Doug Ellis.

""He laughed when that occurred,"" said Dr. Bursten.

Attorney Jessica Manuele said they wanted to redispose Dr. Bursten before trial resumed, but Judge Helinger wouldn't allow it.

The doctor testified that Jonchuck had poor emotional control and his mother said when Jonnchuck doesn't get his way, he acts out.

""She felt that Mr. Jonchuck was jealous of their relationship. She told me that right around that time, not that night, she said that Mr. Jonchuck said that everybody cares about the baby, no one cares about me,"" said Dr. Bursten.

Defense moved for a mistrial. Judge Helinger denied it.

A juror called out sick, therefore an alternate was assigned to the jury pool.

Court resumes Tuesday at 9 a.m.

DAY 8 RECAP:

After weeks of testimony, a juror had to be dismissed after the court learned he was no longer a Pinellas County resident. When the judge asked how he got his summons, the juror said it was sent in the mail to his new address in Trinity.

""I brought it too and I showed it to the lady at the jury assembly line and I said, 'Should I go to Pasco?' and she said, 'No you're here, this is the right number,'"" the dismissed juror said.

Judge Helinger thanked the juror for his time but explained it could be a problem.

""It probably would not be an issue, but if Mr. Jonchuck is convicted, that could be an appellate issue,"" she explained.

Once court resumed, the defense played video of Jonchuck's first appearance for jurors. The judge was trying to appoint him a public defender. In the video, Jonchuck says he wants to ""leave it in the hands of God.""

""Okay, so you want to represent yourself,"" asked the judge. Jonchuck repeated, ""I want to leave it in the hands of God.""

One expert said Thursday that Jonchuck meets the criteria for insanity. Psychiatrist Dr. Michael Maher said, ""he told me he remembered dropping Phoebe off the bridge. He remembered feeling that somehow, this would make her safe.""

The defense rested after that testimony.

The prosecution then called their first rebuttal witness, paralegal Kyrstan Malcolm. After a few questions, Judge Chris Helinger sent the jurors home.

Malcolm remained on the stand and continued to be questioned after jurors left. Jonchuck also left the courtroom.

Malcolm works for attorney Genevieve Torres. Jonchuck hired Torres to establish parental rights and discuss custody of Phoebe.

Court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Friday.

DAY 7 RECAP:

Dr. Richard Cipriano, performed another mental health examination on Jonchuck Wednesday morning in jail to check his competency.

Dr. Cipriano was called to the stand in the afternoon and said Jonchuck was competent to proceed with the trial. The judge then ruled Jonchuck competent and ordered the trial to continue.

Jurors then heard testimony from a doctor and a police sergeant.

DAY 6 RECAP:

Jonchuck's attorneys brought up concerns Tuesday about his competency and whether or not he's able to continue standing trial. His defense team said Jonchuck was hearing statements that were not made.

""He also today has been displaying inappropriate laughter, which is a symptom that we have come to recognize sometimes when he does appear to be losing touch,"" his attorney said.

Jonchuck insisted he was fine and not hallucinating but his attorneys said they were concerned.

Once the concerns were brought up, the judge ordered Jonchuck's mental competency be examined by a doctor.

Dr. Jill Poorman, a court psychologist for the circuit, evaluated his competency and ruled that Jonchuck is still competent to stand trial.

After the doctor made her decision, the judge ended court for the day. She says a doctor will come and evaluate Jonchuck Tuesday night and give a report in the morning.

DAY 5 RECAP:

Michele Jonchuck, John's mother, was called back to the stand Friday to testify. During her testimony, she said John was acting different in the days before Phoebe's death.

Michele testified that John called her the ""fallen angel,"" thought Phoebe was possessed and claimed drywall was making her sick.

She also said John was concerned that Phoebe's mother was plotting to take her from him.

After Michele finished her testimony, the defense team called a forensic psychologist to the stand. Dr. Scot Machlus testified that Jonchuck was off certain medications days before the murder and was having delusions.

DAY 4 RECAP:

The defense team called attorney Genevieve Torres to the stand Thursday morning as their first witness. Jonchuck went to Torres to see about establishing paternity for Phoebe.

Torres testified that Jonchuck visited her office on Jan. 6, 2015 to discuss a petition and said he wanted custody of Phoebe. Torres said Jonchuck sounded normal and she saw no red flags. She even said she was impressed with how much information he had to give her. Torres said Jonchuck was very anxious to move forward with the paperwork.

After the initial meeting, Jonchuck said he would return on Jan. 7 to pay Torres.

The attorney said Jonchuck returned the next day dressed in pajamas and hoodie. He had Phoebe with him, as well as a large Swedish Bible.

Torres said the conversation turned strange when Jonchuck started to talk about the bible and asked her to read it to him.

""Then he insisted that I read the bible to him and I said I can't, it was in Swedish, I don't speak Swedish, I can't read his bible, I'm not going to John,"" she said. ""You are the creator, you speak all languages, you know how to speak Swedish and he wasn't joking.""

Torres said Jonchuck got frustrated when she refused him.

""At one point - when he got tired of me saying I was not going to read the bible and I was not God - and he said then I must be God,"" Torres testified.

Torres said she felt uncomfortable and wanted to get Jonchuck out of the office and reminded him of his appointment with Father Bill at St. Paul Catholic Church to discuss baptisms.

She said Jonchuck begin to pack up. That's when she asked him again about the paperwork.

""He got this serious look on his face and he said 'None of this is going to matter tomorrow,'"" said Torres.

She said she became worried and called authorities once he left. Torres said she was in fear that maybe he would flee with Phoebe, but never got the impression he'd harm her.

Police found Jonchuck at the church as he was speaking with Father Bill Swengros.

After Torres' testimony wrapped, the court took a brief recess before hearing from Father Bill. During his testimony, attorneys brought the Swedish Bible back out.

Father Bill said Jonchuck visited him and asked questions about the Bible and baptism. According to the testimony, Jonchuck got upset when Father Bill told him he couldn't baptize him. Jonchuck then told Father Bill he would go somewhere else. Jonchuck never asked about baptism for Phoebe, Father Bill said.

DAY 3 RECAP:

The first witness called to the stand on day three of the trial was Dr. Christopher Wilson, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Phoebe.

After very brief testimony from the medical examiner, the judge asked for a recess and let the jury out of the courtroom so a ""legal issue"" could be taken care of. Once the jury was out of the room, the attorneys and judge discussed which photos of Phoebe can be shown during the trial to the jury.

After hearing arguments from both sides, the judge ruled only one photo of each injury Phoebe sustained will be admissible, as well as one photo of her face.

Dr. Wilson continued his testimony once the jury was back in the room. As autopsy photos of his daughter were shown to the jury, Jonchuck sat with his face in his hands and a tear in his eye.

State prosecutors rested their case against Jonchuck around 11:40 a.m. The judge ordered a brief 15-minute recess before the trial resumes.

The judge wrapped court for the day around 4 p.m. It will resume at 9 a.m. Thursday.

DAY 2 RECAP:

On day two of the trial, the jury first heard testimony from three additional officers who were involved with the investigation into Phoebe's death. During that testimony, jurors saw the large Swedish Bible that officers say Jonchuck had on him the night Phoebe died.

After that testimony concluded, prosecutors started showing video of Jonchuck in the interrogation room after being taken into custody back in 2015. Much of the interrogation room video shown so far features Jonchuck sitting by himself waiting to be questioned.

At one point, Jonchuck starts talking to the authorities in the room about a conspiracy and ""something bigger going on"" that's ""beyond me, beyond everything.""

""It's almost like - I'm not being weird - this is like a conspiracy. I went looking for answers, I've always had problems growing up like wondering who I was and what my purpose was,"" he said.

In the video, Jonchuck also talks about going to a church and speaking with ""Father Bill."" Jonchuck told a detective in the room that the father said he ""wasn't going to be ready this Easter but next Easter""and that, ""I was the pope.""

After almost an hour of being in the interrogation room, Jonchuck asks about his daughter.

""Is Phoebe OK?"" he asks the detective sitting with him.

The detective responds asking who Phoebe is. After a long pause with his head in his hand, Jonchuck responds, ""Phoebe was my daughter.""

Judge Chris Helinger called the prosecutors and defense attorneys to her bench after watching about an hour of the interrogation room video. Judge Helinger decided to call for a lunch break, putting court in recess until 2 p.m.

When court resumed, the jury watched the rest of the interrogation room video before attorneys cross-examined a detective and a former Hillsborough County deputy.

Jonchuck's mother Michele then took the stand and got emotional talking about her granddaughter Phoebe, who she referred to as her ""princess angel.""

Jonchuck's mother was excused after giving testimony about swim lessons for Phoebe and who was caring for the girl.

Prosecutors then called Sgt. Kenny Miller to the stand. Miller was assigned as the lead detective on the case involving Phoebe's death. While on the stand, Sgt. Miller described getting to the scene around 1:20 a.m. Jan. 8, 2015 and seeing crews searching for Phoebe.

Miller testified that the girl's body was found just after 1:30 a.m.

""The boats were coming in and I saw Phoebe come off one of the rescue boats and they were performing CPR on her,"" Miller said. ""She was wet, she had what looked like pajamas on. And she looked very pale.""

Miller said he did not see any signs of life and did not see Phoebe breathing.

DAY 1 RECAP:

On Monday, the jurors heard opening statements from prosecution and defense teams.

The prosecution's opening statement lasted more than an hour. During that time, attorney Paul Bolan walked the jury through the events that took place at the Dick Misener Bridge just after midnight on Jan. 8, 2015.

Bolan also addressed the defense's argument that Jonchuck was insane at the time of his daughter's death.

""The defense will argue that the defendant was insane at the time that he committed this murder. And I want you to keep in mind that the defense has to establish that by clear and convincing evidence,"" he said. ""You've been read a jury instruction for insanity but I'm going to read it to you again because it's important and we need to consider it. And we need to consider carefully what these words say. A person is considered to be insane when he had a mental infirmity, disease or defect. But the analysis does not stop there. Someone is not insane just because they have mental illness, just because there's something wrong with them or they may say things that sound strange.""

The defense team also walked through the events of the night of Phoebe's death, talking about Jonchuck's actions before, during and after his daughter's death. Attorney Jessica Manuele did not deny that Jonchuck dropped his daughter off the bridge, but called it an act of insanity.

""What happened just after midnight (that night) was tragic. That night, John Jonchuck Jr. took his daughter, whom he loved more than anybody in the world and dropped her over the side of the Dick Misener Bridge,"" Manuele said. ""It didn't make sense at the time, it doesn't make sense today. It will never make sense because it is insanity.""

Manuele told jurors that Jonchuck got out of his car on the bridge holding a large Swedish Bible, then got his daughter Phoebe out and dropped her off the bridge. She argued that Jonchuck was calm and did not hurry away, despite a St. Petersburg police officer witnessing what happened.

The defense team also urged jurors to focus heavily on the evidence without letting emotion get in the way.

""Nobody is disputing that what happened that night was tragic. But if you feel that your heartstrings are being intentionally tugged on, pay attention to that,"" she said. ""We have to focus on the evidence.""

After opening statements wrapped up, two witnesses were called to the stand. The first was St. Petersburg Police Officer William Vickers. Vickers is the officer who was on the Dick Misener Bridge when Phoebe was dropped.

In his testimony, Officer Vickers talked about his actions after Phoebe was dropped.

""I was immediately concerned for the child. I advised radio of what had happened. I was shocked but my immediate concern was the health, welfare and safety of the child,"" he said.

Vickers also described hearing a ""faint scream and a splash"" after Phoebe was dropped from the bridge. The officer says he then climbed down a nearby service ladder to try and search for the child.

""It was in the 40s, low 40s. The winds were gusting over 20 miles an hour. At a couple points, I was nearly blown off the bumper walkway area at the bottom of the bridge,"" he said, adding that the water was rough, dark and cold.

""I continued to call until a fire rescue boat arrived in the area. At that point, I got on to assist in searching and coordinating between police and fire resources,"" Vickers said. ""I looked at my watch a couple of times thinking 'we gotta find her, we gotta find her.'""

The second witness called to the stand was a toll collector who gave a brief testimony about what he saw the night Phoebe died.

After the first two witnesses finished testifying, the judge ended court for the day and instructed jurors not to listen to, watch or talk about anything related to the trial.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

Jonchuck is accused of dropping his 5-year-old daughter Phoebe off the Dick Misener Bridge in January 2015. His murder trial was delayed several years but began in March after a jury of 12 was seated.

Jonchuck was being treated at a mental health facility up until recently. The judge warned the jury that he is medicated and they must not let his present condition in court or side effects from the medications affect their decision-making process.

State prosecutors say they will not seek the death penalty in this case. If found guilty, Jonchuck could serve life in prison. If the jury finds him innocent, he'll stay in a mental institution.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/jury-deliberations-continue-today-in-the-john-jonchuck-trial/1929369878,2019-04-16T07:39:43Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
915,From ‘Smallville' to sex trafficking: What happened to Allison Mack?,"In case you missed it, actress Allison Mack pleaded guilty earlier this week to charges in a sex trafficking case. She had been accused in a scheme that turned women into sex slaves for the spiritual leader of a cultlike group called NXIVM.

Mack is perhaps best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan, a young Superman’s close friend, on the CW series “Smallville.”

The 36-year-old’s guilty plea came Monday, the same day jury selection began for a federal trial in the same case. Mack’s signed plea agreement means she won’t go to court, but NXIVM leader Keith Raniere will, along with wealthy heiress Clare Bronfman and another member of Raniere’s inner circle, Kathy Russell.

NXIVM, by the way, is pronounced “Nex-e-um,"" and Bronfman is a daughter of Edgar Bronfman Sr., a billionaire behind the Seagram (liquor) fortune. Vanity Fair has reported that she, along with a sister, has given millions of dollars to help finance NXIVM and the alleged investment schemes of its leader, Raniere.

Bronfman, Raniere and Russell have all pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.

Mack, on the other hand, wept as she admitted her crimes and apologized to the women who prosecutors say were exploited by Raniere and the so-called self-help organization.

“I believed Keith Raniere’s intentions were to help people, and I was wrong,” Mack told a Brooklyn judge, according to a report from The Associated Press.

'A better person'

Mack also said that after months of reflection since her arrest, “I know I can and will be a better person.”

She is set for sentencing Sept. 11 on two federal racketeering counts that each carry maximum terms of 20 years in prison. It’s likely that she’ll face far less time under sentencing guidelines.

Getty Images Allison Mack leaves the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse with her lawyers after a court appearance in February 2019 (Spencer Platt/Getty Images).

According to the New York Post, Mack got involved with NXIVM in 2006, along with one of her co-stars on “Smallville.”

That same co-star, Kristin Kreuk, has admitted her involvement with NXIVM but said it was before the group was accused of ritual brandings and other humiliating practices to which the cult subjected women, the Post said.

Who else is involved?

About two hours after Mack entered her guilty plea, potential jurors got their first glimpse of the jailed Raniere, who faces new allegations that he exploited a teenage girl.

Opening statements are scheduled for April 29 for a trial that is expected to last up to six weeks.

Court papers allege NXIVM formed a secret society of women who were branded with Raniere’s initials and forced to have sex with him. Defense attorneys have insisted any relationship between Raniere and the alleged victims, including women expected to testify against him at trial, was consensual.

On Monday, Mack said that at Raniere’s direction, she obtained compromising information and images of two unidentified women -- called “collateral” within the group -- that she threatened to make public if they didn’t perform “so-called acts of love.”

DOS: A group within NXIVM

The New York Times started writing about NXIVM in 2017, which is around the same time that Mack’s name first surfaced in connection with the group. The Emmy Award-winning actress was then arrested in April 2018.

NXIVM, for reference, is based in Albany, New York. The organization claims to offer courses and workshops designed to help improve self-fulfillment. Its website describes it as “new ethical understanding that allows us to build an internal civilization and have it manifest in the external world.” (So take that for what it’s worth).

This is where it gets complicated: The most loyal members of NXIVM are sometimes asked to join a group within the organization called DOS, or “dominus obsequious sororium” -- which is Latin for “master over the slave women,” according to published reports. This DOS group is accused of operating as a sex cult, with Raniere at the helm, investigators say.

Sarah Edmondson, of Vancouver, said in the podcast “Uncover” that she was recruited to DOS and that Mack was in Raniere’s inner circle. Edmondson shared a lot about what allegedly went on in the group, until she abruptly dropped out -- and then eventually told her story to a reporter with CBC News, a Canadian network.

Making headlines

Also in recent years, Catherine Oxenberg, from the 1980s show “Dynasty,” has been vocal about her distrust of the group. She even met with prosecutors in New York to detail the experience of her daughter, India, within NXIVM.

For a time, Oxenberg feared that her daughter, who’s in her late 20s, had been starved and blackmailed. Oxenberg spoke with Megyn Kelly on NBC about the fight to save her “hijacked” daughter.

Watch the clip below.

Oxenberg told People magazine last year that her daughter eventually left the group.

Before this week’s plea agreement, Mack had previously pleaded not guilty to charges including sex trafficking, forced labor and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.

Prosecutors claimed Mack helped recruit women by telling them they were joining a mentorship program. As part of her role, authorities said, Mack helped Raniere in the sex trafficking.

The women were presented to Raniere for sex and some had his initials branded on their bodies, prosecutors said.

This fall, we'll learn more about Mack's sentence. It appears she hasn't acted since 2015.

916,Murder suspects seek separate trials,"At what for most guests is a peaceful country getaway, inside of a room at the Sportsman Lodge in Eastpoint a hop and a skip away from the Apalachicola River, on a Sunday evening just about a year ago, Aileen Seiden spent her last night on earth.

The next morning the two people she was traveling with dumped the lifeless 31-year-old in a ditch off 98 and headed back to South Florida, where they met up with a mutual friend in Davie, who soon learned enough of what they told him happened, to report the matter to police.

The two were arrested and extradited to the Franklin County Jail, first Zachary Abell, 31, on May 2, nine days after the battered remains were found, and followed the next week by Christina Araujo, 39, her additional days of freedom spent in the hospital recovering from what officials said was a spider bite. Circuit Judge Terry Lewis denied them bond, and each was assigned to a jail outside the county.

Araujo, daughter of a high-ranking officer with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, has hired Tallahassee criminal defense attorney, James P. Judkins, the cost of which is likely as considerable as the attorney’s decades-long reputation as among the region’s finest. She continues to have her Palm Beach attorney, Scott Richardson, working her case, and here in Franklin County, Apalachicola attorney Steve Watkins has joined as co-counsel.

On behalf of Abell, Apalachicola attorney Donna Duncan has filed with the court that she is joining the public defender’s legal effort, as additional counsel, pro bono.

In an April 3 motion before Circuit Judge Charles Dodson, Abell’s lawyer, Armando Garcia, an assistant public defender in Tallahassee, told the court he backs the motion Araujo’s legal team filed March 25 to ask that there be separate trials.

“I'm reconsidering my position,” wrote Garcia, in an email Monday. “I don't want to make any further statements at this time.”

Araujo’s six-page motion makes clear as the muddy river the two defendants’ different versions of what happened on their fateful visit, but one thing is unmistakable: Each intends to say the other one did it.

“In this case, Abell’s statement in the recorded jailhouse calls, and his statements to Mr. Picavet are of such a character that they would clearly compel a reasonable person to infer Ms. Araujo’s guilt,” reads the motion.

It goes on to excerpt and summarize what Abell has said in recorded jailhouse calls he made to an unnamed female, and based on what he told Michael Picavet, the friend in Davie who turned them in.

“The essence of Abell’s statement to Picavet was ‘Christina was at fault,’ that ‘(Araujo) had a fight with (Seiden),’ ‘she went to bed,” and Ms. Seiden was dead when they woke up,” reads the motion.

The motion counters that Araujo has accused Abell of the charged crimes, which for each of them is second-degree murder, which carries with it a possible life sentence, and tampering with evidence.

“I did not put my hands on (Seiden… I did not push her,” but “(Abell) beat her bad,” the motion says in citing Araujo’s statements to police in a post-arrest interview. The motion says that during this interview, she described how Abell beat Seiden with a walking stick or a paddle, and how after the two discovered Seiden had died, he put the body in the car, and told Araujo to drive “until he found a place” to put the body.

The motion says Abell told Picavet, shortly before his arrest, that Araujo had fought with Seiden “and they passed out, and woke up, and (Seiden) was dead.”

In its excerpts from the recorded telephone conversations, the motion outlines what it says Abell will likely argue what happened that Sunday, which witnesses say began peacefully with a day-long barbecue, enhanced by the downing of a large bottle of Fireball cinnamon whiskey bought earlier that day at 98 Liquors.

“Me and Aileen had been fishing, right, while we were there, and she told me she had been getting morning sickness, and everything like that, right, and she thought she was pregnant,” quotes the motion, from a fourth recording by Abell to the female individual. “(Abell) then supposes Ms. Seiden said something about this to ‘you know who.’

Seiden, it quotes Abell from a second recording, may have told Araujo about the pregnancy, and “you know how (Ms. Araujo) gets.”

“Aileen was waking up with morning sickness, and sh*t, you know? I was excited,” the motion quotes Abell as having said.

The fateful road trip had begun several days earlier when Abell and Seiden drove together from Miami to Texas, and later Araujo flew there to join in the trio’s return trip to South Florida.

Abell is quoted as having said on the telephone to the female, “he loved that girl… that’s why we left (but) she (Araujo) just couldn’t let us be alone, could she?

“I loved that girl, (but) somebody just couldn’t handle it,” it quotes Abell as having said in a third recording.

“The inference is that Ms. Araujo had an extreme reaction to the news which led to Ms. Seiden’s death,” reads Judkins' motion.

It goes on to say that because Abell implicated Araujo in what he told Picavet, any statements that this key witness makes at trial would lead to a jury being “compelled to infer Ms. Araujo’s guilt,” The motion says Abell’s statement are admissible only against him, “but will improperly influence the jury as to the charges against Ms. Araujo.

“Their dueling statements result in inconsistent, antagonistic defenses,” reads the motion. “In this case, both defendants have clearly placed the blame on each other

“(This) may become a ‘definite problem’ should Abell choose to testify while Mr. Araujo remains silent at trial,” it reads. “Accordingly, a separate trial for Ms. Araujo is necessary to avoid violating her confrontation rights, and, ultimately, to assure Ms. Araujo of a fair determination of her guilt or innocence.”

Judkins said Monday he was confident the judge would agree to separate trials. “I think it is fairly clear cut law,” he said.

Based on Picavet’s social media writings, there is little doubt he would testify in a way sympathetic to Abell. The motion also hints at possible collusion when it cites Abell’s statement, on a call to the female individual, to “Tell Mike, ‘thank you for helping.’”

Judkins made clear he would not let Picavet’s testimony go uncountered. “His (Picavet’s) emotional ties to Mr. Abell are fairly irrelevant,” he wrote. “You have to give testimony under oath.”

If Dodson grants the two trials, it will be up to State Attorney Jack Campbell’s office to decide who would go first, as they cannot be held concurrently.

Judkins said he expected a jury trial before the end of the year. “I’ll be shocked if there’s not,” he said.",https://www.apalachtimes.com/news/20190411/murder-suspects-seek-separate-trials?rssfeed=true,2019-04-11T09:09:32Z,The Times,Couple,"129 Commerce St, Apalachicola, FL 32320, USA",FL,32320
917,Mom of 3-year-old model in China sorry over apparent beating,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. AP Photo

BEIJING (AP) - The mother of a Chinese child model has apologized after videos of her appearing to beat her daughter appeared online, sparking outrage and debate about the country's highly competitive child modelling industry.

Videos surfaced online this week showing a woman kicking, slapping and hitting a toddler with a clothes hanger as she appears to be posing for photo shoots.

Internet users identified the child as Niuniu, a 3-year-old girl who models clothes sold on e-commerce website Taobao.

Niuniu's mother published a statement Wednesday apologizing for her actions.

""As shown in the video, my slightly large movements in the process of communicating guidance were in no way intended to cause harm,"" she wrote on the Weibo microblog platform.

Niuniu's mother, who did not disclose her name, said she ""caused everyone to misunderstand,"" for which she felt ""deeply sorry.""

Taobao shared on its official Weibo account a news report about the videos along with a statement of support for the Taobao sellers who sounded the alarm over Niuniu's well-being. The statement said the appeals from kind-hearted e-commerce sellers were the best way to provide children with timely protection.

Some Taobao shops pledged to reduce the use of child models and more closely monitor possible mistreatment of child models. Others condemned the child modelling industry's inherent pressures and vulnerabilities.

""A 3-year-old child lacks the basic cognitive skills to understand such circumstances,"" said lawyer Lyu Xiaoquan.

Lyu's law firm, the Beijing-based Qianqian, represents ""vulnerable groups"" such as women and children. The lawyer is opposed to child modelling as a whole.

""(Children's) privacy and commercial rights might be violated, and they might not be aware of whether this behavior will have a negative impact on their values and upbringing,"" Lyu said.

919,Legislature should act to protect seniors in nursing homes: your say,"0409 Cartoon (Photo: Dave Granlund, PoliticalCartoons.com)

Protect seniors

I am writing about the “Proposal to probe elder deaths receiving little pushback in Florida Legislature”, which ran on April 1, regarding a potential bill to review the deaths of Americans in nursing homes and rehabilitation centers as a result of neglect or abuse.



Having worked in a senior living facility in Florida, I am concerned about the well-being and mistreatment of older Americans in nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. I believe that a bill should mandate the creation of teams that oversee the overall treatment of older Americans and the role of neglect and abuse in their deaths.

If the Florida Legislature established the Child Abuse Death Review Committee in 1999, which protects an at-risk population, then we should mandate a bill protecting other at-risk groups and their deaths. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 25 percent of nursing home abuse cases are not reported nationally. This is outrageous as thousands of older Americans suffer from physical and sexual abuse and neglect while nothing is done.

To advocate for this bill preventing future deaths caused by mistreatment, Lee County residents should write to our senator, Lizbeth Benacquisto.

Change needed

A recent letter titled ""Brilliant Founders"" says that eliminating the Electoral College would ""invalidate your vote and automatically assign our electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote."" What? Invalidate your vote? Actually, it's just the opposite. It's the Electoral College that invalidates your vote.

The principle of one person, one vote somehow doesn't apply to presidential elections. The reasons have to do with the Founders' concern that rural voters weren't well-informed or well-educated enough to make an intelligent choice. But the advent of mass media and television has made those reasons invalid.

Alexander Hamilton said we need the Electoral College because it ensures ""that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications."" If you're not shaking your head you should be, because that's not what's happened.

It seems clear to me that today's electoral system is guilty of ignoring the will of the people not the other way around. In today's America where everyone has access to the same information, it should be one person, one vote ... and your vote should count just as much as anyone else's.

Confront reality

We are promised 1.25 million undocumented immigrants entering the country this year. And they want to hire more border control officers. This is like hiring more traffic cops to cope with an ocean tsunami in Miami.

What's the answer? I don't know. But I do know that the changes to the demographic, economic and political life of this country are going to be profound. I would hope that the authorities come around to confronting this reality sooner rather than later. Along with the rest of us.

Install benches

I’m writing in response to “Benches, sidewalks, safety top concerns for local leaders after the death of Cape Coral girl” in support of Cape Coral administration installing benches for children to safely sit on while waiting for the bus. I am saddened to hear that an 8-year-old girl was hit by a truck and killed while waiting for the school bus.



As a dedicated volunteer of Children’s Advocacy Center of Southwest Florida, I am extremely concerned at how avoidable this death was. Our children are our future and the city’s negligence show that administrators priorities are too focused on economics and not public safety.

If you agree with me write to your city officials and tell them that you want to change. No child should those their future because of the irresponsible decision’s city administrators make.

In the meantime we need to educate our children on how they can be safe while waiting for the bus by standing at least 6-feet away from the street, paying attention while they’re near traffic and not approaching any moving vehicles until they come to a complete stop.

Editor's note: This story contains graphic details.A man has been arrested after police say he beat his daughter to death.According to a criminal complaint, 36-year-old Brandon Reynolds told police he became enraged after his daughter, Sarah Dubois-Gilbeau, didn’t want to do her homework, that “he didn’t know what came over him” and “that’s when the discipline set in.” He told police he started spanking her and “blacked out,” the complaint states. He eventually called 911 and reported that Dubois-Gilbeau had gone into cardiac arrest. When emergency crews arrived, they attempted to revive the girl before she was transported to University of New Mexico Hospital, where she was pronounced dead Friday. Rescue personnel contacted Albuquerque police to alert officers of the situation. The complaint states that when officers arrived, they noticed bloodstains on the living room wall and carpet.A neighbor told police she heard Reynolds yelling, “'Get up!’ followed by sounds of someone or something being struck.” When officers arrived at the hospital, they observed severe bruising all over the Dubois-Gilbeau's body. The bruising, police said, was consistent with the tread from a shoe. Reynolds is being charged with child abuse resulting in death. Police said Reynolds and his daughter had recently relocated to New Mexico from California.Neighbors remember Dubois-GilbeauThe neighborhood where Dubois-Gilbeau lived is a tight-knit community.""She was so cute. She was a little angel,"" said one neighbor. The neighbor said she used to babysit Dubois-Gilbeau. They would paint each other's nails and do their hair. ""She didn't deserve this,"" she said.

John Jonchuck's first-degree murder trial begins Monday in St. Petersburg for the 2015 death of his daughter, Phoebe.

His attorneys admit their 29-year-old client dropped the girl into Tampa Bay, but say he was insane.

Jonchuck had a history of hospitalizations. Hours before the girl's death, his divorce lawyer called a state hotline, saying he was having a mental breakdown and she feared for Phoebe's safety. The hotline operator never reported her concerns to investigators.

If convicted, Jonchuck will receive a life sentence. If acquitted by reason of insanity, he will likely be hospitalized the rest of his life.

A survivor of the worst mass shooting in Jacksonville's history is speaking out against a new play centered around the tragedy.

Action News Jax report Russell Colburn spoke with the theater group putting on the production and a survivor from the shooting - watch the full report on FOX30 at 10:

Nine people were killed, and others were injured in the General Motors Acceptance Corporation massacre of June 1990.

“He started walking down the aisle just shooting anybody that he saw,” said survivor, Paul Sternett.

Sternett took cover behind his desk as James Edward Pough opened fire at the GMAC office on Baymeadows Way.



“I turned and looked, and he was raising his rifle. He had me basically in his sights. A girl next to the one who had already been killed crawled out right at his feet,” Sternett said. “He killed her, and I went out the door.”

Wednesday, Florida State College of Jacksonville held its last dress rehearsal for the play ""Repossessions: Mass Shooting in Jacksonville.""

Tim Gilmore said he was inspired to write it after the Parkland High School massacre.

“There’s no violence in the play at all,” Gilmore said. “This play is an attempt to treat respectfully and sensitively the stories of people who were there.”

For the cast and crew, this play is the culmination of six weeks of work. They’ll take the stage Thursday night for the show that runs through Sunday.



But Sternett, who survived this horror, is against it.



“The shooter will be mentioned, of course, and he, ultimately, is glorified,” Sternett said. “I think that’s a lot of why we have so many shootings now.”



The director of the play, Ken McCullough, understands that viewpoint.



“If I had gone through something like this, and I found out somebody was doing a play or a film about it, I probably would not go see it,” McCullough said.



The play will not feature any sounds of gunfire.

FSCJ will have heightened security during the shows. McCullough said it’s because of the world we live in.

The images of the GMAC shooting -- as haunting today as they were 29 years ago -- make it clear why.

Tickets to the play are $10 for adults. To reserve seats, call (904) 646-2222.

She still struggles with grief and daily frustrations, but she tries to stay positive, and has continued to make progress with the help of her family and her faith. Alex Driehaus, Naples Daily News

Kayleigh Ferguson-Walker races her daughter down the driveway of their home and onto the cul-de-sac of their Coral Springs neighborhood — the little girl on a bike with training wheels, her mom in a motorized wheelchair.

Aaliyah shrieks and giggles when she beats her mom to the end of the driveway. But if Mom wins, it’s because she cheated.

“Again,” Aaliyah tells her mother about a dozen times. She wants to go again.

It’s warm out and Ferguson-Walker is ready to go back inside. Meanwhile, her 4-year-old zooms around like a Looney Tunes character.

Ferguson-Walker wants her daughter to have as normal a life as possible. She strives to be a dedicated mother despite some limitations.

When Ferguson-Walker had her arms and legs, she could run after her daughter and hold her. She would dance with Aaliyah when she came home from work every day. She could braid her girl’s hair. They could bake together and play at the park.

“Those things I do long for,” Ferguson-Walker, 32, said. “She remembers to this day, I promised her when I get my legs I’d dance with her.”

All the Moms: Girl, 4, hospitalized with life-threatening sepsis after trying on shoes without socks

Ferguson-Walker was a healthy, young mom and wife until the day her health spiraled.

She worked as a pharmacy technician. She and her husband, Ramon Ferguson-Walker, were expecting their second child — a boy they’d already named. She was six months pregnant.

The couple’s dream to buy a home was close to becoming a reality. They looked forward to raising their growing family in a two-story home in Ave Maria and be close to some of Ramon’s family.

Then things fell apart.

In March 2017, a deadly illness claimed Ferguson-Walker’s limbs and the life of her unborn child, but it didn’t take away her will to fight.

Like a bad flu



It felt like a bad flu.

The night she got sick, Ferguson-Walker thought she could sleep off the temperature spikes and chills, but her symptoms grew worse.

She asked her husband for water and juice, but she couldn’t keep the fluids down. Her heart raced.

Ramon packed his wife and daughter in their car and rushed them to the Broward Health Coral Springs emergency room. As doctors and nurses examined Ferguson-Walker and took her to the labor and delivery unit, her condition went into a steep decline.

She felt dizzy and had trouble breathing. Her vision was blurred. Her heart rate spiked and her blood pressure tanked. She couldn’t provide a urine sample; her kidneys were failing.

“Everything was failing,” Ramon Ferguson-Walker, 36, said.

Doctors induced labor. The couple’s baby boy didn’t survive.

Her heart continued to race. Her breathing was labored. Doctors sedated her and, ultimately, induced a coma to treat her.

Ferguson-Walker was in a coma for two weeks, her family gathered around a hospital bed praying for her recovery, hoping she would live.

In March of 2017, Kayleigh contracted sepsis, which caused her to lose her unborn child and all four of her limbs. Since then, she has been learning to complete tasks that have allowed her to slowly regain a level of independence, as well as learning how to fill her role as a mother in a different capacity.

At the hospital

When Ferguson-Walker emerged from her coma, she said she knew something was still wrong.

Her hands were puffy and black. Her extremities were necrotic, she said — the tissues died from lack of blood flow.

“I was a big water balloon,” Ferguson-Walker said.

Ramon Ferguson-Walker said his wife’s diagnosis came down to sepsis possibly caused by a complication in her pregnancy called incompetent cervix, a condition in which the pressure of a growing baby can cause the mother’s cervix to open prematurely, causing preterm labor or miscarriage. The condition can increase the risk of infection.

Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition in which the body becomes overwhelmed by an infection and essentially turns on itself, blocking blood flow to parts of the body and possibly causing extensive tissue damage and organ failure, if not death.

2017: 'Rory's Regs' on sepsis require hospital checklists, save lives

A lawsuit the couple filed in Broward County Circuit Court cited the diagnosis. The Ferguson-Walkers filed the suit in October 2018, seeking more than $15,000 in damages and alleging Kayleigh’s doctors were negligent in her prenatal care.

According to the suit, Kayleigh saw one of her doctors about a month before she got sick and was placed on antibiotics for symptoms related to incompetent cervix. One of her doctors discontinued the antibiotics a few days later, and that day she was admitted to Broward Health Coral Springs for monitoring and steroid injections. She was discharged the next day, according to the suit.

Two weeks later, Kayleigh landed in the hospital again with the life-threatening infection.

Kayleigh’s doctors filed defenses, denying negligence and contending the couple's own negligence contributed to her illness, according to court records.

Sepsis causes the body’s blood-clotting mechanism to go into overdrive, causing blockages in the blood vessels and keeping oxygen and nutrients from reaching tissues and organs.

Her organs were spared from blood flow-related damage. Her limbs weren’t. When Ferguson-Walker emerged from the coma, she was transferred to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale for surgery. Doctors told her they would need to amputate her limbs.

Her family sprang up with questions: Were there no other options? What alternative treatments could be considered? Couldn’t some of her limbs be saved? How much time did they have to decide?

“We didn’t have the luxury of time to think about options,” said Dr. Robert Fletcher, Ferguson-Walker's surgeon. (Fletcher is not among the doctors the lawsuit accuses of negligence.)

Ferguson-Walker, still under the haze of medications and unable to ask many questions herself, didn’t take long to make her decision.

She told doctors to do whatever they needed to do to save her life.

Grateful

Ferguson-Walker said she is grateful to be alive. So is her family. But their gratitude still comes with pain.

Ferguson-Walker’s mother, Laurel Robinson, still gets emotional when she talks about what her daughter has gone through. She said it was hard to see her daughter lose her independence and struggle with everyday tasks people sometimes take for granted.

Robinson sometimes helps her daughter bathe. She put a shirt on Kayleigh one day after a bath and told her to put her arm through the sleeve.

“I was waiting for her arm to come through and realized it wouldn’t,” Robinson said.

Ferguson-Walker’s legs were amputated below the knee. Her left arm was amputated below the elbow; her right arm above the elbow.

“I do have faith but also question God,” Robinson said. “Why all four limbs? Why not just one? But I’m also glad she’s here in her daughter’s life and her husband’s. I know she’ll get better. She won’t be at this stage forever, but you still wonder when and why.”

Their gratitude also comes with frustration.

Ferguson-Walker wants to take care of herself independently again. To drive, bathe herself, go to work, take walks, swim. To not have to rely on anyone but herself to get to where she needs to be.

She gets discouraged sometimes, Ferguson-Walker said, because of everything she wishes she could do. But she works every day toward achieving goals and views her challenges as a journey.

“I’ve been thinking positively,” Ferguson-Walker said. “Thinking I have to go on in life and do things creatively. Take things one day at a time.”

In the two years since she fell ill, Ferguson-Walker has mastered feeding herself, putting on her makeup, combing her hair and getting herself around her parents’ home with the help of an electric wheelchair and a left-arm prosthetic with a hook attached. She can transfer herself from her regular wheelchair to the sofa in her parents’ living room.

She started seeing a therapist in the past few months and said talking to someone helps. For a while, she attended a support group for amputees at a Hanger Clinic in Broward, where she is being examined for prosthetics. Some of her wounds are still healing.

She said she would like to create her own support group of people closer to her age who survived sepsis or lost limbs. She is thinking of making motivational videos and doing speaking engagements somewhere down the line.

Her husband is there to challenge her, encourage her to take on new things and cheer on her progress.

He sometimes sends his wife YouTube videos of amputees talking about their journeys and showing what they have accomplished since the incidents that claimed their limbs. The videos, he hopes, will show her everything she can do and inspire her when she feels low. He looks for ways to make her life easier and tells her he believes in her.

“He pushes me,” Ferguson-Walker said.

She started to take up writing and drawing. She can fill out doctor’s forms with her prosthetic and draws pictures at home with Aaliyah.

In the past few months, she started transferring herself from her bed to her wheelchair and vice versa. It requires some twisting, wiggling and praying she won’t hit the ground, but she gets it done.

“Being able to do that felt good,” Ferguson-Walker said. “Once I got over the fear, the task became so much easier.”

Every accomplishment, every small step toward independence, is a victory.

“From 2017 to now, I see it as a new lifestyle,” Ferguson-Walker said. “I didn’t want to take it on as something impossible to live with, to live through. The triumph is still being here. Having a family, being a wife and mom.”

A home of their own

The couple and their daughter moved in with Kayleigh's parents when she was discharged from the hospital and rehabilitation programs. Kayleigh’s mom helped with her daughter’s personal care while Ramon was at work. Kayleigh’s dad, Charles Robinson, helps with Aaliyah’s care and drives her to and from school.

The couple’s dreams for the future, while postponed, also keep them afloat.

Two months before Ferguson-Walker got sick, the couple started the process of buying a home. They were almost ready to close on a house in Ave Maria.

“This puts a pause right in the middle of your dreams,” Ramon said. “We were looking forward to having another child, and this happened. We felt like we made it; we’re there, buying a home.”

Months after his wife’s illness, he said they had to decide whether they should go through with the purchase.

They did. Ramon said it was an opportunity they didn’t want to pass up. The house was a symbol of the hope they had before his wife’s illness, he said, but it wasn’t a good fit. It’s two stories tall, and while Kayleigh hopes to one day have prosthetics on her legs, she can’t climb stairs. The couple may sell or rent the house once they have a place they can move into.

The Ave Maria house serves as an escape for Ramon and Kayleigh when they need a break from the doctor’s appointments, insurance calls and general responsibilities. They try to drive from Coral Springs to Ave Maria every few weekends and visit some of Ramon’s family, watch movies and go out for ice cream. Their drives also allow them to see the progress of their home being built.

Aaliyah will have a room on the second floor. Ramon and Kayleigh will sleep on air mattresses or on a couch in the living room.

“Every time we come here, we’re holding on (to the hope),” Ramon said.

The home isn’t wheelchair-accessible, so the space Kayleigh can use is limited. They bought an Amazon Alexa device that gives Kayleigh some voice control over things such as the television, lights and thermostat.

Friends of the family are raising money to build a more accessible home not far from the one the couple bought.

After Kayleigh fell ill, a GoFundMe account was created to help the family with medical bills and expenses. The fundraising for the more accessible home is being done through a website called Fundly.

The couple said CC Homes, the builder of the home the Ferguson-Walkers bought, agreed to build them a more accessible one-story home and donate the labor. The house will have ramps, widened doorways and some basic smart technology.

Looking ahead

Despite the setbacks, low moments and frustrations, the couples’ faith in God, their family and each other keep them moving forward.

(Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Aaliyah saw her mom at the hospital when Kayleigh was being treated in 2017. The girl, then 2 years old, realized something was different and didn’t want to get too close to her mom at first. She became more comfortable once Kayleigh was moved to the rehab center and started asking questions.

Kayleigh told her, “Mommy’s legs and arms had to go, but I’ll get something to help me.”

It took her some time, but Aaliyah would get close and give her mom kisses. She’d grab a spoon and feed Kayleigh, then herself. She’d put on gloves and apply her mom’s lotion.

Aaliyah became her mom’s little helper and still is. She brushes Kayleigh’s hair, helps with her makeup and sometimes feeds her snacks.

The Ferguson-Walkers wanted their girl to have a little brother. Aaliyah probably would have been as caring for him as she is for her mom.

Kayleigh has her moments, but she said she has made peace with the loss of her baby. Talking to her husband and therapist helped her process the grief.

“The only way to move forward is to confront these things I’m uncomfortable with,” she said.

Robinson, Kayleigh’s mom, said it was difficult for her daughter to be around pregnant women at first. Kayleigh said she has become more comfortable being around babies, but she sometimes feels off balance when she is around baby boys.

“For the little one we lost, we’ll see him again,” Ramon said. “We work harder now because of how things have changed.”

For Kayleigh, the hard work of recovery will culminate in being able to dance with her daughter again.

She was also named female artist of the year.Musgraves said the award ""goes out to anyone — woman, girl, or anybody, really"" who has been told ""her perspective or style is too different.""""Just stay at it. It'll work out,"" said Musgraves, who won four Grammys earlier this year, including album of the year and best country album.Other categories didn't feature many female nominees: Bebe Rexha was the only woman competing for song of the year with ""Meant to Be,"" while Maddie & Tae was the sole female act up for duo of the year.But both honors, along with single of the year, went to Dan + Shay.""I think somebody got the cards mixed up tonight,"" Dan Smyers said onstage at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

933,Judge orders psychological exam for teen accused in stabbing,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A Broward County judge Sunday ordered a Coral Springs teenager accused of stabbing a classmate to be securely detained and undergo a full psychological assessment.

A defense attorney for Jayden Hutchinson -- a 16-year-old junior at Coral Springs High School -- argued that the boy should be placed under house arrest, but Judge Ginger Lerner-Wren disagreed. The attorney said the teenager is an excellent student, an athlete and active in the community.

According to Broward County Public Schools spokeswoman Nadine Drew, Hutchinson stabbed a 17-year-old classmate in the leg Friday during a fight over a girl in the school's parking lot just after 3 p.m.

Drew said school employees intervened and broke up the fight.

Paramedics transported the victim to a local hospital. His injuries were described as not life-threatening.

Hutchinson faces a charge of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

Parents of Coral Springs High School students received a message Friday from Vivian C. Suarez, the school's principal, saying both students involved in the fight will be facing ""appropriate disciplinary measures.""

934,"6 shot, including 2 children, during baby shower on South Side","Seeley shooting Seeley shooting

- At least six people were wounded, including an 8-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl, in a shooting Saturday evening on the South Side that happened while a family was celebrating the upcoming birth of a child.

Gunfire erupted at 6:21 p.m. at a gathering in the 6300 block of South Seeley in the Englewood neighborhood, according to Chicago police. Two men in dark clothing approached the family gathering and opened fire before fleeing on foot, police said.

Both children were taken to Comer Children’s Hospital where their conditions are critical but stable, authorities said. The boy was struck in his back and chest, and the girl was shot in her shin, police said.

A 29-year-old woman was shot in her shoulder and chest, while a 42-year-old man was shot twice in his hip, police said. They were taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where the woman was in critical condition, and the man’s condition was stabilized.

The gunfire also hit a 23-year-old man in his foot and a 28-year-old man in the shoulder, police said. They were both taken to Holy Cross Hospital, where their conditions were stabilized. The older man was later transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital.

Witnesses were not cooperating with investigators, but based on the victim’s profiles police believe the shooting may have been in retaliation from an earlier incident in the neighborhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Detectives were reviewing footage from nearby surveillance cameras but had little physical evidence to work with at the scene.

The family was celebrating the upcoming birth of a child, authorities said.

The mother and grandmother of the wounded 8-year-old boy were seen waiting outside Comer, both of them visibly distressed. The mother, whose shirt was stained with blood, was crying out for her child.

“He’s just a baby, he’s just a baby,” the mother said, as tears flowed down her face.

The grandmother told reporters the boy was in surgery.

Meanwhile, in another shooting, a 13-year-old boy was seriously wounded about 8:20 p.m. in the 1200 block of West 73rd. Two males ran out of a vacant lot and fired shots into a car where the boy was sitting, striking him in the hip, police said. The car drove to 69th and Racine where paramedics were called. The boy’s condition was stabilized at Comer.

Speaking to reporters outside Comer, community activist Andrew Holmes called for prayers for the young victims and urged any witnesses to talk to police.

936,"Father beat 5-year-old girl to death for not doing her homework, police say","(CNN) - A New Mexico father admitted to beating his 5-year-old daughter to death over homework, police said.

Albuquerque police said paramedics were called to an apartment complex on Amherst Drive at about 1 a.m. Saturday after the Sara Dubois-Gilbeau went into cardiac arrest.

""The injuries were not consistent with what they were told,"" said Officer Simon Drobik.

Shortly before the girl died, police said her 36-year-old father, Brandon Reynolds told them she had heart problems, but they didn't buy his story.

""It appears that this father brutally beat this child,"" Drobik said.

Police said Reynolds later admitted to getting mad at his daughter late Saturday night when she didn't want to do her homework.

This ""triggered"" him and he beat her up and down her body with a water shoe, police said.

""She loved pink purple and blue,"" said a neighbor, who chose not to be identified.

Other neighbors are also in shock. They said Reynolds was strict and they knew he would spank the girl sometimes, but never in front of them.

But last night, neighbors said they heard a commotion coming from his apartment.

Prosecutors say Dolson took a cruise on the Norwegian Epic out of Port Canaveral a year ago.

During the cruise, and in international waters, investigators said he lured a 13-year old girl into a hot tub and committed a sex crime.

Tod Goodyear, with the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, said there was video from the ship that showed the pair in the hot tub together.

""It does not show any of the activity which took place underwater, but there was some evidence that they had been together and were in the hot tub together,"" Goodyear said.

947,Bodycam video shows arrest of man accused of sexually assaulting child,"Daytona Beach police released body camera video of the moment a man accused of sexually assaulting a girl was arrested.

Investigators in Putnam County said they had been searching for months for 44-year-old Stanley Hunter, so the moment Putnam County detectives got a tip that he was at a Daytona Beach hotel, they made sure Daytona Beach police paid him a visit. Bodycam video shows Hunter being captured last week inside the Streamline Hotel.

""Put your hand up. Get your hands up,"" police can be heard saying in the video.

Daytona Beach police took Hunter into custody on a warrant charging him with capital sexual battery on a child under the age of 12 and two counts of sexual battery on a minor between the ages of 12 and 18.

The bodycam video confirms Hunter knew why he was being arrested the moment officers entered the hotel room where he was staying.

Police: ""You know why we're here? Tell us you know why we're here.""

Hunter: ""Yeah. I got a warrant.""

According to the warrant, on three occasions, Hunter sexually assaulted a girl to whom he is not directly related. The girl told investigators when she was 11, Hunter inappropriately touched her. The warrant states that on another occasion when the girl was 12, he choked the girl and raped her. Investigators also said he threatened to kill her and anyone she told of what happened.

As Hunter was being taken into custody, he assured a crying woman who was in the room with him that he had a lawyer who was taking care of the situation.

As of Thursday, Hunter remained in the Putnam County jail without bond because of the seriousness of the charges against him and because authorities said he’s considered a flight risk.

948,Girl at center of nationwide search reunited with father in Lake City,"A 10-year-old girl missing for nearly a year after Utah authorities say she was kidnapped by her biological mother has been reunited with her father after she was found safe in Lake City, Florida.

Since last summer, local and federal authorities in Utah and Nevada had been looking for Ariana Bozemen. Police in Enoch, Utah, said the girl was kidnapped by her biological mother, 34-year-old Dawn Closson, after the girl's father was granted sole custody of the child.

Deputies following a lead from an anonymous tip found Ariana and her mother at an interstate rest area near Lake City early Wednesday morning.

The girl's father, Adrian Bozemen, said he got a call about 2 a.m. Wednesday from police and just about 24 hours later, his daughter was back in his arms.

""I can’t stop thinking about seeing her face and hearing her voice,"" Bozeman said before their reunion.

He drove from Oklahoma, where he is stationed at an Air Force base, to Florida to pick Ariana up so the two can spend time catching up as they drive back home.

They spent the morning at a Walmart buying clothes for Ariana before they started their road trip.

Bozeman told News4Jax that his daughter was confused about everything taking place when they were reunited. She told him her mother had told her horrible stories about him trying to destroy the girl's relationship with her mother.

“I told her that no matter what you do or what we go through here, the No. 1 thing we need is communication,"" Bozeman said. ""'If you feel a certain type of way about something going on, just let me know and we’ll work on it together. We’re going to be together from here on out.' She smiled and everything was good after that.”

He has learned that Ariana, her mother and her mother's boyfriend had been living in an RV for some time but that they had ditched it and were living out of an SUV, only traveling at night and never checking into hotels. Her mother had been homeschooling her while they were on the run.

Bozeman said when they get back to the base in Oklahoma he's going to enroll his daughter in a counseling program offered by the military. She'll be able to have private sessions with the counselor and family sessions with Bozeman each week.

He said that despite everything, he wants Ariana to have some kind of relationship with her mother.

Mother arrested

Investigators in Utah said they contacted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office after they got a tip from an anonymous Florida resident who noticed something suspicious about the girl and her mother. Investigators said the tipster went online, saw news reports about the girl and called them. Columbia County deputies said they located the 10-year-old inside an SUV at a rest stop along Interstate 75 near Lake City.

""This is just a mindful and watchful resident that was able to help us bring this to justice and get the girl safely back,"" said Sgt. Isaac Akeroth, with the Enoch Police Department.

Also inside the vehicle was Closson (pictured), Closson’s boyfriend and several other children, authorities said.

Closson was arrested and booked into the Columbia County jail, online jail records show. She is charged with custodial interference across state lines, and authorities said more charges are pending.

Her boyfriend and the other children in the SUV were allowed to leave while Ariana was placed into protective custody by the Department of Children and Families.

Currently, Closson is the only one facing charges, but police in Utah said if they can prove her boyfriend was aware she illegally took the child, he could be facing charges, as well.

ST. PETERSBURG — No one disputes John Jonchuck dropped his 5-year-old daughter from a Florida bridge to her death four years ago, but whether he is a murderer or insane will soon be up to a jury to decide.

Jonchuck, 29, goes on trial Monday for the Jan. 8, 2015, death of his daughter Phoebe, whom he dropped 62 feet into Tampa Bay as a St. Petersburg police officer watched helplessly.

Jonchuck is charged with first-degree murder, but prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty. If convicted, he will automatically go to prison for life.

If his attorneys' insanity defense works, he would be sent to a psychiatric hospital, and it's unlikely he would ever be released. To be eligible, he would have to prove he was no longer mentally ill or dangerous.

Pinellas County Public Defender Bob Dillinger told the Tampa Bay Times he knows of no Florida case where a killer was found not guilty by reason of insanity of first-degree murder and eventually released.

""He'll be in a state prison for the rest of his life, or a state hospital for the rest of his life,"" Dillinger said.

More: Florida medical board may curtail asking doctors about past mental illness on applications

Successful insanity defenses are rare. Under Florida law, Jonchuck's attorneys must convince the jury his mental illness was so severe he didn't know what he was doing or that it was wrong.

Jonchuck did have a long history of mental problems before he and his daughter ever reached the Dick Misener Bridge. His family told the Times he had been involuntarily committed 27 times and seemed to be having a breakdown.

Twelve hours before Phoebe's death, Jonchuck's divorce lawyer, Genevieve Torres, called a state child protection hotline, fearing for the girl's safety.

Torres told the Department of Children and Families operator Jonchuck had driven to three churches in his pajamas with Phoebe in tow that morning, called Torres ""God"" and asked her to translate his stepmother's century-old Swedish Bible, which he carried and had become obsessed with. The attorney said Jonchuck also was paranoid that Phoebe wasn't his child.

""He's calling the office every five minutes and saying these religious things and saying the child might not be his — it just really concerns me,"" Torres told an operator. She added, ""It's all craziness and it doesn't make any sense and he's out of his mind.""

More: No one stood up for pregnant woman with disabilities at Bridges. We need to know why | Our view

Torres also told the operator, who was inexperienced, that the department had an open investigation after an earlier caller accused Jonchuck of violence, substance abuse and inadequate supervision.

The operator thought the attorney was more worried about Jonchuck's safety than the girl's and did not report the call to authorities.

Just after midnight the next day, Jonchuck's PT Cruiser raced past officer William Vickers, who was heading home from his shift in his patrol car. He started following Jonchuck, but never got close enough to read the license plate and didn't know Phoebe was inside.

As they reached the bridge's crest, Jonchuck stopped and got out. Vickers, fearing an ambush, stopped behind him, pulled his gun and yelled at Jonchuck to show his hands. He saw no weapon.

Jonchuck yelled at the officer, ""You have no free will."" He grabbed Phoebe from the back seat, held her over the side momentarily and then dropped her. Vickers thinks she screamed.

Jonchuck drove off, but was soon arrested. Vickers scrambled down a ladder to a dock below the bridge, but couldn't see Phoebe in the dark water. A marine rescue boat was summoned, and her body was found hours later.

954,"Port St. Lucie fire, 20 years later: How has the city changed since historic blaze?","Share This Story Tweet Share Share Pin Email

Michael and Linda Boogaart sat in silence as they stared at a copy of the Port St. Lucie Tribune, now tattered and yellow with age.

The brick house belonging to Michael and Linda Boogaart on Urbino Avenue erupts into flames while a tree in front of the home remains largely unscathed on Thursday, April 15, 1999, in Port St. Lucie.

(Photo: ERIC HASERT/TCPALM)

Even though the image was grainy, the Boogaarts recognized immediately their Southwest Urbino Avenue home, the serpentine branches of a giant, 150-year-old oak tree enveloping the property in western Port St. Lucie.

Tears welled in their eyes.

Twenty years later, the Boogaarts, now residents of Jensen Beach, were seeing for the first time their home, completely engulfed in flames.

""That's our house,"" Michael said. ""I've never seen that before. I've never seen the house on fire.""

The Boogaarts' home was one of 43 destroyed April 15, 1999, by a wind-whipped fire that scorched 2,400 acres between Florida's Turnpike and Interstate 95, blasting through neighborhoods from Southwest Del Rio to Southwest Gatlin boulevards. About 100 other homes were damaged, according to news reports, and 25 boats, cars, sheds and recreational vehicles also were lost.

The firestorm caused $4.5 million in damage. Remarkably, no one died.

A destructive combination of high winds and extremely dry conditions — the drought index was 703 out of a possible 800 — fueled the fire. Firefighters had been battling blazes for weeks, including one the night before that state officials say most likely sparked the bigger fire.

At the time, the city had not yet expanded its water and sewer system west of the turnpike, so there were very few hydrants in the affected area. Firefighters were forced to pull water from the C-24 Canal as well as from residents' swimming pools. Also, the development boom in that part of the city was still about five years away, so many homes were in heavily wooded neighborhoods.

As a result of the fire, significant changes were made to Port St. Lucie's infrastructure — there are now thousands more hydrants throughout all 120 square miles of the city — to guarantee fire protection to the most populous city on the Treasure Coast.

Still, the indelible memories of that day resonate with the residents who lived in the fire zone as well as the emergency services officials who battled the blaze.

The Boogaarts learned their home was destroyed a few hours after being evacuated, while watching the local news with friends.

""I knew there was no other red brick house with a basketball hoop, it was like a gut-punch,"" said Michael, 52, who became an insurance agent after losing his home to the fire. ""You realize you just lost everything. Literally, whatever you're wearing is what you have.""

A few days later, they returned to sift through what remained, but other than a few pieces of china and a teapot commemorating the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, the fire had destroyed everything.

""You're seeing all this stuff and it's like a shadow of what you saw 24 hours earlier,"" Michael said.

It took a few years to sink in, admits Linda, 52, who teaches kindergarten at Felix A. Williams Elementary in Jensen Beach.

""I would go into the drawer to find something to cook with, and it wouldn't be there,"" she said. ""It would be like, 'Well, I know I had that measuring cup,' and then, 'Oh no, we lost that.' ""

The Boogaarts' son Zachary, now 21, was only 9 months old at the time of the fire. Carson, 18, was born three years later.

""At the time you think it's the end of the world, but it really isn't,"" Michael said. ""Life is fragile. What this does is make you put less importance on stuff. We work so hard to have nice cars and a nice house, but what it boils down to is it's just stuff.""

Linda and Michael Boogaart are seen at their home March 12, 2019, in Jensen Beach. A brush fire April 15, 1999, destroyed their home and 42 others in Port St. Lucie. ""It's just a part of life. Fortunately, my family was safe, that was the main thing,"" Michael said about the experience. ""We had a good insurance policy, so we were able to rebuild ... We look back at that now, we're fine.""

Lessons learned

In response to the fires, the Port St. Lucie City Council voted to construct a fire loop, consisting of one water main and hydrants that would service the areas of Southwest Del Rio and Southwest California boulevards as well as along Southwest Savona and Southwest Darwin boulevards and Southwest Becker Road.

The mandate was to have the fire loop complete before the 2000 fire season, said Donna Rhoden, deputy director of utility systems for Port St. Lucie.

""If there were fires in those general vicinities, trucks could get to that fire loop and pull water from those hydrants there,"" she said.

Even though the inventory of hydrants had grown to 2,100 by 1999, the city had concentrated the expansion in the central city between the river and the turnpike, Rhoden said.

""There were very few hydrants west of the turnpike,"" she said. ""The handful that existed were near the intersection of Gatlin and Port St. Lucie boulevards.""

Today, there are 5,560 hydrants providing water service and fire protection to the city.

Over the past two decades, Port St. Lucie, now the eighth largest city in Florida, has doubled in size. To keep up, the Port St. Lucie Police Department has done the same.

There now are 238 officers on staff, according to Chief John Bolduc. In 1999, Bolduc estimates there were about 120.

[ Click on the map to watch a time lapse of development in Port St. Lucie. If you cannot see the graphic, refresh your browser or click here. ]

Bolduc's isn't the only department now better equipped to handle wildfires.

The St. Lucie County Fire District enhanced its wildfire training, which includes more prescribed-burn exercises to learn about fire behavior, and improved coordination and communication with the Florida Forest Service and other Treasure Coast fire districts, said Fire District Chief Nate Spera.

It also upgraded to 800-megahertz radios that can integrate almost instantly with, in particular, the Martin County Fire District.

""Of course, having accessible water everywhere makes a huge difference, too,"" Spera said.

In fact, the Luck Wildfire, a 70-acre blaze that forced the evacuation of 40 homes last March in the city's Southbend neighborhood, could have been much worse had there not been a hydrant within a few feet of the fire, Spera said.

""The direction that fire was going in, for the better part of the afternoon, was pointed at about three houses,"" Spera remembers. ""Had we not had a hydrant right there, we would have lost at least two of them, I can promise you.""

'I've never seen fire behavior like that'

By the time Spera arrived at the intersection of Southwest Merrick Street and Southwest Gatlin Boulevard the afternoon of April 15, 1999, the wind began to shift.

The fire moved quickly, dropping ash a quarter mile ahead of it. The wind picked up everything that was burning, blowing it miles ahead of the fire.

Spera — who was off duty at the time and had driven to the scene in his own truck — remembers watching the 1998 Dodge Dakota catch fire and burn behind him as he retreated to the east in a brush truck.

""I've never seen fire behavior like that, before or since,"" he said. ""I've been a firefighter for 34 years and I've never seen it like that.""

The fire jumped Southwest Gatlin Boulevard and the C-24 Canal.

Even though the major burning phase didn't surpass six hours, it was a tricky fire to get under control.

Houses were peppered throughout the western part of the city, blending in with patches of unattended parcels, overgrown with brush, pine trees, palmettos as well as the invasive Brazilian pepper tree, Spera said.

""Basically, those Brazilian peppers burned like mad,"" he said. ""Every time you thought you got (the fire) down a little bit, a Brazilian pepper would pop up and it was like putting gasoline on a fire.""

Today, through development, there isn't much open area for a fire to run, Spera said.

""There were houses back then that would have brush right up to a fence line,"" he said. ""We couldn't even get behind the house because the vacant lot next door had not been cleared at all.""

Ensuring there's a safe perimeter and defensible space around a home, for residents as well as for firefighters, is one of the most important ways to prepare for fire season, according to the Florida Forest Service.

Current fire outlook

In 1999, from March 15 to April 14, six hundredths of an inch of rain fell at Treasure Coast International Airport, according to John Pendergrast, senior meteorologist and fire weather program leader at the National Weather Service, Melbourne.

""We're not seeing anything that's looking like a dry period like (1999),"" he said.

The Climate Prediction Center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, anticipates above-normal rainfall for the Florida peninsula through the spring.

""If that does indeed pan out, that's good news,"" Pendergrast said. ""April is normally the driest month of the year in Central Florida."" (Click on the photo to enlarge it.)

Weak El Niño conditions are likely through the spring, too. El Niño — a natural climate pattern where sea water in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean is warmer than average — tends to bring increased rainfall at the start of the dry season, which typically starts in October.

Better rainfall chances mean lower chances for wildfires.

As of April 9, the Keetch-Byram Drought Index average in Indian River County was 436; in St. Lucie it was 393; and in Martin it was 343, below normal for this time of year, according to the Florida Forest Service.

The drought index ranges from 0 to 800, with 0 representing swamp-like conditions and 800 being a desert.

Wildfire activity in March was below average, compared to the past 10 years, with only two wildfires in Indian River County, one in St. Lucie and four in Martin, said Melissa Yunas, spokeswoman for the Florida Forest Service.

“All we need to do is just have two weeks without rainfall and we start running wildfires again. I don't want people to think we're out of the woods this year.” Melissa Yunas, Florida Forest Service

""All we need to do is just have two weeks without rainfall and we start running wildfires again,"" she said. ""I don't want people to think we're out of the woods this year.""

Current El Niño conditions also have allowed land managers, biologists, farmers, ranchers and citrus industry workers a larger window of opportunity to manage their land with the use of fire, Yunas said.

""We typically restrict burn authorizations when fire activity increases,"" she said.

In 1998, one year before the Port St. Lucie blaze, more than 10,000 firefighters battled 2,200 fires across the state. Because of those fires, Florida now has one of the most extensive and active prescribed burning programs in the country, Pendergrast said.

Prescribed fire is used to reduce hazardous fuel buildups, providing increased protection to people, homes and the forest, according to the Florida Forest Service.

In an average year, the service issues about 88,000 authorizations allowing landowners and agencies to burn an average of more than 2.1 million acres each year.

'One blessing after the next'

The only item Eileen and Bill Nelson could salvage from their home on Southwest Jennifer Terrace was a pink cardboard stork.

""Where (the stork) was, leaning on a palm tree, they were the only things untouched by the fire,"" said Eileen, 55. ""It was a sign that showed she had a girl, she's healthy, she brought her home, she's safe.""

Their daughter, Shaelyn, turns 20 on April 14.

One week earlier, the Nelsons were given three dates for Eileen's scheduled Cesarean section: April 12, April 14 or April 16.

""We picked April 14 because it was mid-week,"" Eileen remembers. ""The scary part is, I could have been home during the fire.""

The Nelsons — who lived about 3 miles northeast of where officials believe the fire started — were able to build a new home on the same lot. Then, one year later, Bill, who works for Pratt & Whitney, was transferred. The family moved to Vernon, Connecticut, where they still reside today.

""It was one blessing after the next,"" Eileen said. ""Still, to this day, we say it was meant to be the way it happened.""

Two men who opened fire on a crowd of people gathered for a baby shower, wounding six people, including two children, may have acted in retaliation for an earlier gang conflict, police said Sunday.Authorities have only “shards of information” about what happened at the family gathering in Chicago because witnesses are not cooperating, a police spokesman said, but investigators hope the serious nature of the children’s injuries will prompt someone to talk.“This is a very tragic incident. You have two young children, an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, clinging to life,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.At least a dozen people were gathered outside a home decorated with balloons for the baby shower when two armed men approached on foot and began shooting about 6:30 p.m. Saturday, Guglielmi said.The gunmen fired multiple rounds and ran away down an alley, he said.An 8-year-old boy was shot in the chest and back, and a 10-year-old girl was shot in the leg. Both children were in critical but stable condition. Their names were not released.Also shot were four other people — three men ranging in age from 23 to 48 and a 29-year-old woman. The woman was hospitalized in critical condition, and the two younger men were in stable condition.The condition of the oldest man was unknown, and Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the woman who was hurt may have been the person who was pregnant.People rushed inside the house when the shooting began. Children who had been playing in the yard reportedly started piling atop one another as they tried to get through the door.“We were trying to pick the kids up, get the kids out of the way. They were going to get crushed,” Richard Nix, whose grandson was having the shower, told The Chicago Tribune. “It wasn’t nothing but kids in front of the house, sitting on the porch. They was just playing, and the shooting went off.”The shooting occurred in the West Englewood neighborhood of Chicago’s South Side, and investigators had indications it was in retaliation for a previous incident, the spokesman said.“It’s part of a larger conflict that’s going on in that area,” Guglielmi said.Another shooting occurred Sunday morning about three blocks from the home where the gunfire erupted, he said, but it was unclear whether there was any connection.Authorities have struggled to contain violence in Chicago, the nation’s third-largest city. Police said 561 homicides were committed in the city last year, a total that exceeded the number of killings in New York and Los Angeles combined.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/2-children-4-adults-shot-and-wounded-during-baby-shower-in-chicago/27070155,2019-04-08T09:06:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
958,"Following Grammy win, Dan + Shay victorious at ACM Awards","Keith Urban, Kacey Musgraves, Dan + Shay win at ACM Awards

Grammy-winning duo Dan + Shay solidified themselves as the hottest group in country music with multiple wins at the Academy of Country Music Awards, where Keith Urban was named entertainer of the year and Kacey Musgraves won three honors.

Urban won the top prize Sunday with his ninth nomination for the award, besting Chris Stapleton, Luke Bryan, Kenny Chesney and Jason Aldean, who held the title the last three years.

""Baby girl, I love you so much,"" Urban said, looking to his actress-wife, Nicole Kidman. ""To the fans out there, you are amazing. You have no idea what you mean to me.""

Urban also won entertainer of the year at the Country Music Association Awards in November — his first time winning the prize since 2005.

No women were nominated for the coveted ACM honor. Musgraves was the sole women up for album of the year.

She won twice when ""Golden Hour"" picked up top album — as an artist and co-producer of the project. She was also named female vocalist of the year.

Musgraves said the award ""goes out to anyone woman, girl, or anybody really"" who has been told ""her perspective or style is too different.""

""Just stay at it. It'll work out,"" said Musgraves, who won four Grammys earlier this year, including album of the year and best country album.

Other categories didn't feature many female nominees: Bebe Rexha was the only woman competing for song of the year with ""Meant to Be,"" while Maddie & Tae was the sole female act up for duo of the year.

But both honors, along with single of the year, went to Dan + Shay.

""I think somebody got the cards mixed up tonight,"" Dan Smyers said onstage at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. ""This is all incredible. We are all winners tonight.""

Smyers technically won five honors — picking up double wins in song of the year as artist and co-writer (shared with Jordan Reynolds and Nicolle Galyon) and single of the year as artist and co-producer (shared with Scott Hendricks). Shay Mooney didn't write or produce the song.

Even Thomas Rhett jokingly dedicated his male vocalist of the year trophy to Dan + Shay.

""I am going to give this to Dan + Shay so they can go home with four,"" he said.

Rhett also gave a shout-out to his wife who sat in the audience: ""You are smoking hot tonight.""

Rhett performed Sunday, while Dan + Shay hit the stage to sing ""Keeping Score"" alongside Kelly Clarkson, hitting impressive high notes. Chris Stapleton's performance was also a highlight. The singer-songwriter, who often performs with his wife, Morgane Stapleton, sang onstage as she held her hand over her stomach (she is pregnant).

Emmy-nominated ""This Is Us"" actress Chrissy Metz made her live singing debut and gave an emotional performance onstage, teary-eyed at the song's end. Metz sang ""I'm Standing with You"" from the upcoming film ""Breakthrough,"" which she stars in. She was joined onstage by Carrie Underwood, Lauren Alaina, Mickey Guyton and Maddie & Tae — the performers all wore blue dresses and sang in unison.

Ashley McBryde, who won new female artist of the year, also was memorable: Nearly in tears, she strummed her guitar and beautifully sang ""Girl Goin' Nowhere."" The 35-year-old was nominated for best country album at the Grammys and recently earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for her performance on ""CBS This Morning Saturday."" McBryde shined again onstage when she joined Eric Church to sing ""The Snake.""

Jason Aldean kicked off the awards show with a fun performance featuring the hit-making duo Florida Georgia Line. Aldean earned the Dick Clark Artist of the Decade Award.

""More than anything — thank you to the country music fans (and) country radio, you guys have changed my life forever,"" he said. ""This is one of the proudest nights of my life.""

Reba McEntire, who hosted the show for the 16th time, told several jokes. When she mentioned the collaborative performances of the night — Khalid and Kane Brown and Brandi Carlile and Dierks Bentley, among others — she said she would perform with rap star Cardi B.

She said they could sing her song ""There's No U and Oklahoma,"" then said: ""And that's okurrr with me,"" earning laughs from the audience.",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190407/following-grammy-win-dan--shay-victorious-at-acm-awards?rssfeed=true,2019-04-07T21:59:30Z,News Chief,Couple,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881

960,Family of 3 seriously injured in fiery Pine Hills crash,"The Orange County Fire Rescue said investigators are on scene at a crash in the area of North Pine Hills Road and North Lane in Pine Hills.

ORLANDO, Fla. - Three family members were seriously injured Friday night in a crash in the Orlando neighborhood of Pine Hills and the driver of the other vehicle involved left the scene, according to troopers with the Florida Highway Patrol.

BOWLING GREEN, Kentucky (WFLA/CNN) - The family of a brave 21-month-old girl in Kentucky is celebrating after the toddler beat stage 4 cancer.

Little Molly Hughes spent 130 nights in the hospital after she was diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Molly underwent 15 months of grueling cancer treatment and proved she is one tough little cookie.

""She would just bounce back after every treatment. I mean she would knock her down for few days and then she would be at playing again,"" said Molly’s mother Chelsea Hughes.

Molly’s family and friends rallied to support her during her cancer fight and #MollyStrong became their battle cry.

Now, Molly’s family and friends are celebrating their victory over the deadly disease. Molly’s mom will always remember the phone call that brought the good news.

""Just like, I fell to the ground after I got off the phone and I just hugged her for like five minutes,” said Hughes.

Molly’s mom says the power of prayer helped her daughter. “I believe that's what helped her get through all this. With all the prayers she's heard and which I can't thank everyone enough for.”

966,Young girls around world suffering from breast ironing abuse,"If you’ve never heard of breast ironing, you should know it’s as bad, if not worse, than it sounds, and it’s happening to young girls around the world. It's not a new practice, but it has just recently been recognized by the United Kingdom government as a form of child abuse.

What is breast ironing?

Breast ironing, which originates from West Africa, involves ironing a young girl’s chest with hot objects in order to delay the growth of her breasts, according to the BBC. In many cases, a girl will also be made to wear an extremely tight strap around her chest to suppress the growth of the breasts even more.

The practice can lead to tissue damage, abcesses, cysts, fever, infection and itching.

It can go on for months.

In fact, the United Nations estimates there could be up to 3.8 million girls around the world who have been exposed to breast ironing.

It has been documented as happening in African countries such as Cameroon, Chad, Benin, Guinea-Bissau and Togo, but the CAME Women and Girls Development Organization, which aims to improve the health and wellbeing of a variety of people from disadvantaged communities, is concerned breast ironing could be affecting at least 1,000 girls and women in the U.K.

You might ask why anyone would do this.

Cases of abuse

Margaret, one woman who suffered the form of abuse as a child, explained it’s not done with bad intentions. Instead, mothers believe they are protecting their daughters from sexual abuse, rape or getting unwanted attention from boys at too young an age.

A woman named Comfort told the BBC she still remembers running from her sister, who allegedly abused her by doing breast ironing on her when Comfort was 9.

“I remember screaming a lot,” Comfort said. “She’d say, ‘Get on the floor,’ and then she would rub the stone on my chest. Someone got hold of me and they just held me while she did it … She was saying to me, ‘Your breasts shouldn’t be growing at this time. You’re too young.’ When I think about it, I can literally still feel the pain.”

Margaret now runs a charity in London to help young girls who have been through breast ironing.

Impacts of breast ironing

“We have seen girls who have not developed breasts. We have seen girls who have difficulties breastfeeding because the breast milk is not flowing. We have seen girls who have developed cancer,” Margaret said.

Psychotherapist Leyla Hussein said the psychological impacts breast ironing have on a girl are far-reaching: post-traumatic stress, severe depression, body dysmorphia. She said a lot of the victims will struggle in relationships.

“What they’ve experienced is not a traditional practice … it’s actually violence,” Hussein said.

Stopping the abuse

The violence is still happening so frequently that British politician and former lawyer Nicky Morgan is trying to bring awareness so that teachers can identify when the abuse is happening to their students. Even though it has recently been recognized as a form of abuse, there is still no specific law banning it in the U.K.

Morgan said it should be “tackled, addressed, talked about and stopped,” and that those who work with girls and young women have a very important role to play.

“It’s going to be essential for schools, teachers, school nurses, family members, friends of the girls involved to blow the whistle when they know that such things have occurred,” said Lord Alex Carlile, who is a British barrister and crossbench member of the House of Lords. “It’s purposeless, it’s violent, it’s crude, it’s disgusting and it’s a crime.”

Now that breast ironing has been labeled a form of abuse, breast ironing victims and witnesses are being urged to come forward.

“When you don’t talk about something that seems so secretive, it just eats away in you. It just does,” Comfort said.

A former gynecological nurse, Angie Marriot, told the BBC the true scale of breast ironing has been concealed because of underreporting, and women are afraid to speak out because they fear they could be ousted from their communities.

“To say the least, it’s an abuse. It hurts. It dehumanizes you,” Marriot said. “You are not a human being.”

The Escambia County Sheriff's Office is investigating reports of a Ransom Middle School student who was filmed allegedly torturing a bunny rabbit in a video that has spread on social media.

The video, which has more than 10,000 views on Facebook as of Friday morning, was discovered by the Ransom Middle School Resource Officer, who alerted the school district and the sheriff's office to its existence.

Maj. Andrew Hobbs with the Escambia County Sheriff's Office confirmed to the News Journal on Friday morning that authorities and school officials were aware of the video and are investigating the incident.

The disturbing Snapchat video, posted on Facebook, shows a girl sitting in a yard, repeatedly grabbing the small white bunny by its back and tossing it into the air. At one point, the bunny runs across the yard in an attempt to escape, and the girl runs after it, tackles it and carries it back into the yard.

She then holds it by its hind legs and throws it high into the air again.

Children can be heard laughing in the background.

Hobbs said the bunny did not die, but Escambia County Animal Control is involved in the investigation. The News Journal has reached out to the county for more information on the bunny's condition.

Hobbs said he believed the bunny was a family pet, but he wasn't sure.

Charges have not been filed as of Friday morning.

Escambia County School District Superintendent Malcolm Thomas said the incident did not happen on school grounds, and as such would not be considered a school discipline-related issue.

""There's no discipline from the school's perspective because this was not an incident that happened at school,"" Thomas said. ""This becomes a wrongdoing that happened in the community that, in this case, law enforcement and animal cruelty agencies are investigating.""

Thomas said he could not disclose the student's name or her grade due to student privacy issues.

""It was a terrible video,"" Thomas said. ""But we have referred to the appropriate agencies and are letting them handle this.""

968,Girl at center of nationwide search found safe near Lake City,"After a nearly yearlong search for a kidnapped 10-year-old girl from Utah came to an end in North Florida, the child and her father will be reunited.

Since last summer, local and federal authorities in Utah and Nevada had been looking for Ariana Bozemen. Police in Enoch, Utah, said the girl was kidnapped by her biological mother, 34-year-old Dawn Closson, after the girl's father was granted sole custody of the child. No one could locate the two until early Wednesday morning when deputies said the two were located at an interstate rest area near Lake City following an anonymous tip.

Adrian Bozemen, Ariana's father, told News4Jax that he got a call about 2 a.m. Wednesday from police, letting him know his daughter had been found.

""He said, 'Adrian, we found her.' I said, 'What do you mean?'"" Bozeman said. ""I’m reaching for something not there, stumbling around the bedroom. My wife woke up next to me. She (was) looking at me with big eyes. I just couldn’t believe it.""

Investigators in Utah said they contacted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office after they got a tip from an anonymous Florida resident who noticed something suspicious about the girl and her mother. Investigators said the tipster went online, saw news reports about the girl and called them. Columbia County deputies said they located the 10-year-old inside an SUV at a rest stop along Interstate 75 near Lake City.

""This is just a mindful and watchful resident that was able to help us bring this to justice and get the girl safely back,"" said Sgt. Isaac Akeroth, with the Enoch Police Department.

Also inside the vehicle was Closson (pictured), Closson’s boyfriend and several other children, authorities said.

Closson was arrested and booked into the Columbia County jail, online jail records show. Her boyfriend and the other children in the SUV were allowed to leave while Ariana was placed into protective custody by the Department of Children and Families. Her father said he chose to drive from Oklahoma, where he is stationed at an Air Force base, to Florida to pick her up so he can spend more time with her driving back home.

""I didn’t know what physical or mental state my daughter would be in, so I figure we would have no choice but to talk to each other. I get to learn more about her because she’s been gone for so long,"" Bozeman said. ""I think I’m going to be cool about it. I think I’m going to break down. I think I’m going to be nervous. I’m going through all these different emotions. I want to be strong for her.""

Currently, Closson is the only one facing charges but police in Utah said if they can prove her boyfriend was aware she illegally took the child, he could be facing charges, as well.

Bozeman and his daughter should be reunited by Thursday morning.

""I can’t stop thinking about seeing her face and hearing her voice,"" he said.

977,Paralyzed man finds purpose in volunteering at Halifax Health and body building,"Eric Murphy, 47, recently rolled his wheelchair into the room of a new patient at Halifax Health's Inpatient Rehabilitation center.

""Hey man, how you doing?"" he asked 75-year-old Richard Pajula, who was recovering from a bladder and intestine infection.

They launch into a conversation, bonding over their struggles getting in and out of the shower. Pajula also has multiple sclerosis, which often confines him to a wheelchair.

""It's great talking to someone who's not a doctor or a nurse,"" Pajula said, pointing to their wheelchairs. ""We have a lot in common, so we just build each other up.""

For Murphy, volunteer work at the hospital has given him a purpose he has worked to find since an ATV accident left him paralyzed from the waist down and unable to work in 2003.

""I love coming here,"" he said. ""It makes me feel good about myself and I can give back now.""

When he's not helping out patients at Halifax Health, he's now training to be a body builder. He will compete in the wheelchair division of an upcoming competition in August.

""I worked out a lot in high school, but that was for sports,"" Murphy said. ""I never thought I would be a body builder and compete.""

In 2003, Murphy was 32, lean and fit, and led an extremely active life in Massachusetts. He had played football in high school. But he developed a love for all-terrain vehicles which eventually led to racing them competitively on dirt tracks.

A freak accident put Murphy in a wheelchair. He wasn't even riding at the time. He was at a race, eating lunch, when a rogue rider slammed into his back.

""Somebody who wasn't a racer, somebody who shouldn't have been on a bike, hit me square in the back,"" Murphy said. ""I was on (an ATV) that wasn't running with my helmet off. I was eating a McDonald's McChicken when I got hit. I don't even remember getting hit.""

The impact broke Murphy's back in two places. His hip, pelvis and ribs were shattered. His face was split open as it hit the handlebars, knocking out his two front teeth.

Murphy spent three and a half weeks in the intensive care unit at Boston Memorial Hospital because he'd contracted pneumonia. He then had multiple surgeries, resulting in four months of inpatient rehabilitation.

The accident also led to personal challenges. His first wife left him.

""She left me with my biological son, and she left her oldest son from another relationship with me,"" Murphy said. ""I took care of them, but they also took care of me. They are my angels.""

Although his broken bones had healed, he was left with myriad medical issues, the worst being uncontrollable muscle spasms that sometimes knocked him out of his chair, causing him to bang his knees on the floor, tables and anything on the ground. The falls sometimes left deep gouges in his knees. Then those wounds wouldn't heal because of the lack of blood flow to his legs. It left him hospitalized seven times with sepsis — the body's sometimes deadly response to an infection with symptoms including fever, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, fast heart rate and mental confusion.

""It literally drove me nuts,"" Murphy said. ""I couldn't drive; I couldn't move. For 10 years, doctors couldn't control my spasms with medication.""

His son Patrick Murphy, now 16, can't put a number on the amount of times the spasms have knocked his dad out of his chair.

""He's fallen to the ground a few times and I've had to scoop him up,"" Patrick said. ""Him getting dressed was a lot harder.""

Besides the muscle spasms and open wounds, Murphy developed arthritis in his hands from constant use and from hyper-extending them when he lifted himself in and out of his pick-up truck. His right leg also formed a large calcium deposit that now wraps around some veins and cannot be removed.

""The average person doesn't understand the struggles we face after the accident,"" Murphy said. ""They just see that we are in the wheelchair.""

""Growing up, I knew everything was a little more difficult for my dad,"" Patrick Murphy said. ""It made me grow up faster because me and my brother had to help him.""

Relief didn't come until Murphy and his sons moved to Port Orange three years ago.

""When I came here, I had all open wounds everywhere,"" he said. ""You could see my knee joints and the bones. It took four to five months just to heal one cut.""

His journey to Florida began when he connected with the ""hot girl"" from his high school, who is now his wife. She lived in Florida and reached out to him when she saw they had a mutual friend who was also in a wheelchair.

""I thought he was good looking,"" Sheryl Carrigan said. ""He was full of compliments, very complimentary towards everything. He did that and he still tells me I'm beautiful everyday.""

When Murphy came to Florida for the first time, he had just gotten out of the hospital from one of his many bouts with sepsis. He was instructed not to travel because he was so sick. He ignored his doctors warnings.

""It was the best decision I ever made,"" he said. ""I came down for a seven-day date and never left.""

Carrigan pushed Murphy to go to the doctor to get his open wounds treated and his muscle spasms under control.

""He was a mess, I was determined to get those damn knees taken care of. He had a lot of open wounds and I had to take him to wound care to get those treated,"" Carrigan said.

The turning point came 18 months ago. Dr. Carolyn Geis, board certified in inpatient rehabilitation at Halifax Health, installed an ""Intrathecal Baclofen pump,"" which constantly administers medication to Murphy's spinal cord. The pump has nearly eliminated Murphy's spasms.

""Before he couldn't really do much, every little movement sent his body into a spasm"" Geis said. ""It's been a struggle for him. He's a remarkable guy to have been able to cope with things for so long.""

Geis also connected him to the volunteer opportunity in Halifax Health's rehabilitation facility.

""He's able to share his struggles,"" Geis said. ""He really needed something to give him purpose and meaning.""

Murphy said his change in lifestyle has made a drastic difference not just in his life but also for his family.

""Now I get up with a smile on my face,"" Murphy said. ""I'm a different person from six months ago.""

In the guest bedroom of his three-bedroom home in Port Orange, Murphy has a Bowflex home gym system. During a reporter's visit, he rolled his wheelchair over to the base and wedged his wheels into a block of wood to keep him from moving. He grabbed the handlebar, pulling it to his core in a steady rhythm.

""I don't want to feel handicapped,"" Murphy said. ""If I can't do it myself, I don't want to do it.""

Murphy began his body building journey in January. He began volunteering at Halifax Health in October. He did so after Carrigan left him for a time in September 2018 because he wanted to stay home all day, and he became controlling of her free time.

""He would literally sit here in the house all day and wait for me to come home,"" said Carrigan. ""I couldn't go out, I couldn't call or text anyone. He wanted me all to himself.""

Carrigan didn't see a light at the end of the tunnel, so she left, hoping that her absence would be a wake up call for Murphy.

""He didn't have a life or want to do anything, so it was all on me until I left him,"" she said. ""After I left, he went out and started at the hospital, he started counseling, and he started working out.""

The two are back together now, but it took a lot of work on Murphy's part to become open to new things.

""I was a miserable asshole,"" Murphy said. ""I'm glad she did that and pushed me to do things I wouldn't have done before.""

Patrick is happy that his dad's quality of life has improved.

""He's more independent now. It's helped him a lot in a positive way,"" Patrick Murphy said. ""It's changed his outcome on a lot of things. He's a lot less limited now.""

Murphy wants to stay on the path he's on and continue to improve himself. He clearly enjoys his volunteer work at Halifax Health.

""I've come a long way and I can see the difference in myself,"" he said. ""I have a life again, a purpose. This is a blessing to be here.""

In February, Murphy reached another first. He went skydiving for the first time, something he and his son never imagined he would be able to do.

""It's pretty exciting; it's not something I ever thought I would see him do,"" Patrick Murphy said. ""He always watched me do things. But now I get to watch him.""",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190410/paralyzed-man-finds-purpose-in-volunteering-at-halifax-health-and-body-building?rssfeed=true,2019-04-10T10:21:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
979,"Kacey Musgraves, Dan + Shay win big at ACM Awards","Kacey Musgraves' Golden Hour"" continued its winning streak: It won album of the year at the Grammys and repeated the win at the Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday.

Musgraves said she had ""some of the greatest memories of my entire life"" while recording the album. She also thanked her sister, who was sitting in the audience at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, for designing her album covers.

Musgraves' critically acclaimed ""Golden Hour"" won four Grammys, including album of the year and best country album. However, she didn't score a nomination for the top prize at the ACMs — entertainer of the year.

Instead, men make up the nominees exclusively for a second straight year with Chris Stapleton, Keith Urban, Kenny Chesney, Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean, who has held the title since 2015.

Musgraves was the sole female artist in the album of the year category.

Bebe Rexha was the only woman competing for song of the year thanks to the record-setting hit ""Meant to Be,"" featuring Florida Georgia Line, while Maddie & Tae is the sole female act up for duo of the year.

But both honors, along with single of the year, went to Dan + Shay.

""I think somebody got the cards mixed up tonight,"" Dan Smyers said onstage. ""This is all incredible. We are all winners tonight.""

Smyers technically won five honors — picking up double wins in song of the year as artist and co-writer (shared with Jordan Reynolds and Nicolle Galyon) and single of the year as artist and co-producer (shared with Scott Hendricks). Shay Mooney didn't write or produce the song.

At the Grammys, Dan + Shay won best country duo/group performance for ""Tequila,"" which peaked at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot country songs chart and No. 21 on the all-genre Hot 100 chart.

Even Thomas Rhett jokingly dedicated his male vocalist of the year trophy to Dan + Shay.

""I am going to five this to Dan + Shay so they can go home with four,"" he said.

Rhett also gave a shout-out to his wife who sat in the audience: ""You are smoking hot tonight.""

Rhett also performed Sunday, while Dan + Shay hit the stage to sing ""Keeping Score"" alongside Kelly Clarkson, hitting impressive high notes. Chris Stapleton's performance was also a highlight. The singer-songwriter, who often performs with his wife, Morgane Stapleton, sang onstage as she held her hand over her stomach (she is pregnant).

Ashley McBryde, who won new female artist of the year, also was memorable: Nearly in tears, she strummed her guitar and beautifully sang ""Girl Goin' Nowhere."" The 35-year-old was nominated for best country album at the Grammys and recently earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for her performance on ""CBS This Morning Saturday."" McBryde shined again onstage when she joined Eric Church to sing ""The Snake.""

Jason Aldean, the reigning entertainer of the year champion at the ACMs, kicked off the awards show with a fun performance featuring the hit-making duo Florida Georgia Line. FGL's Tyler Hubbard wore a denim outfit featuring the American flag as he sang onstage with band member Brian Kelley and Aldean.

Reba McEntire, who is hosting the show for the 16th time, told several jokes. When she mentioned the collaborative performances of the night — Khalid and Kane Brown and Brandi Carlile and Dierks Bentley, among others — she said she would perform with rap star Cardi B.

She said they could sing her song ""There's No U and Oklahoma,"" then said: ""And that's okurrr with me,"" earning laughs from the audience.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190407/kacey-musgraves-dan--shay-win-big-at-acm-awards?rssfeed=true,2019-04-07T21:24:58Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
980,It's time to give the heave-ho to the Matlacha Mullet Toss: your say,"0407 Cartoon (Photo: Rick McKee, The Augusta Chronicle, GA)

Toss the Toss

A few years ago, I wrote a letter expressing my negative feelings regarding the Mullet Toss in Matlacha. It was published, and then letters berating me for my opinion followed.

On March 24, I read the letter of Donna Reynolds, stating that she felt the same way I did about the bad example this inhumane event sent to children. Today, I see a letter from Carol Taddeo saying she also found this event very disturbing.

I am happy to note that I have read every letter every day in between the publication of these two, and have not seen any defending this cruel, yearly event. Perhaps we can hope that enough people will give some thought to the message this throwing of a once living thing sends to our children and replace the creatures with bean bags, as suggested by Carol.

All living things have the right to be respected.

More light

I agree with recent letters naming darkness as contributing to the tragic death of a young schoolchild waiting for her bus early one morning last month.

Note that just two weeks before the young girl lost her life, we changed our clocks to daylight saving time, in effect making the mornings darker. Without that change, she would have been at her bus stop at about the time of sunrise, rather than an hour earlier, while it was still pitch dark.

I think the current movement to observe daylight saving time year-round is ill-advised. It makes more sense to go the other way: stay on standard time year-round. There would still be plenty of evening light in the summer, even with sunset an hour earlier.

Let’s give our kids more light, not less.

Money talks

There was a great cartoon (flooding in the Midwest) in the March 30 News-Press. Artist forgot the red hats. I am suggesting though that rural America (especially farmers) is sick of this mess. Face it, they made a mistake.

Likewise, USA TODAY must have made a big mistake, placing “Midwest reeling from bomb cyclones"" and ""Coal king as global carbon emissions rise”, next to each other on March 28.

They can’t be suggesting that climate change is associated with severe weather events? This places them in opposition to their climate change denier subscribers. Especially on a day when the president is in Florida telling about his help to restore the Everglades.

From where I am, it looks like Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades might both be underwater from sea level rise before this is accomplished. First, they must carry out this big plan to restore the financial viability of all the contractors involved in the big projects.

This sounds much just like how this problem started in the beginning – Lake Okeechobee and obstruction of the normal flow to the Everglades – making sure that big contractors and big farmers got their needs taken care of first.

Find conscience

I remember the number of times some demagogue has rallied the people against someone who is not “us”. Each time they have assured the people that the end of America is on the doorstep. Every time the demon hordes have somehow metamorphosed into the people who built America.



Once again, we are asked to believe that another group of people bring crime and disease and aren’t our problem anyway. Once again, people who only want the dream that is America will need to starve and die while we huddle in fear.



Holocaust memorials all over our country will not let us forget that we turned our backs on millions of Jews who were headed to gas chambers. How many more times are we going to allow ourselves to be the playthings of demagogues who would use us for evil? Can we really throw a blanket over the Statue of Liberty and deny its place in our national conscience?

I hope we’ll tell the demagogues that we found our conscience and to take their foolishness on down the road.

984,"Chelsea Handler says Trump's 2016 win sent her to a shrink, hooked her on marijuana","- Comedian and activist Chelsea Handler shared Friday that she had to seek out a psychiatrist after Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election.

Handler explained during an appearance on “Real Time with Bill Maher” that she went through a “midlife identity crisis” after Trump shocked the world by defeating Hillary Clinton for the nation's highest office, saying she never felt her life feel “so unhinged.”

“I had to pay a psychiatrist to listen to me b---- about Donald Trump for about the first three weeks,” Handler told Maher. “And then once when we got past that and got to the real stuff, I realized the parallel there was my world becoming unhinged when I was a little girl, my brother died when I was nine years old. I had never related the two, but for me, as I can imagine it must have been for so many people, it was an emotional trigger of everything being destabilized and I realized how spoiled and privileged I had been all my life and realize to be this upset and this on-a-ten every day and the outrage and the anger, I just wanted to f---ing fight people, you know? And I was like, ‘I have to go see a psychiatrist.’”

The liberal comedian also spoke about having “white guilt” and how she realized in therapy that she had believed she didn’t have “the right to be in pain” because she hadn't been raped or molested.

“I’m a more mindful citizen because of it and I woke up. I’m in an awakening,” Handler continued.

She also said Trump’s election win “led” her to smoking marijuana and pivoting away from alcohol, calling cannabis the “gateway drug to meditation.”

986,Father arrested rushing daughter to hospital; nurses raise jail bond,"CENTREVILLE, Ill. - A father rushing his choking daughter to the hospital was arrested for violating several traffic laws during the drive.

But the silver lining is that the hospital's nurses came to the rescue and bonded him out of jail Thursday.

KTVI reports Darius Hinkle does not have a driver's license, but put that all aside as he was trying to get his daughter to the hospital in Centreville (Ill.). Hinkle said the girl was choking on a penny.

Police officers from different agencies were trailing Hinkle the entire way, and arrested him once he arrived at the hospital.

The child's mother said she learned about the nurses' generosity when she arrived at the jail and learned they had collected money to pay the bond.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - Police are conducting a death investigation in Miami Gardens.

A body was removed from a home on Northwest 17th Court early Friday.

Miami Gardens police haven't confirmed how the person died, but the victim's granddaughter told Local 10 News that she was shot and killed in a dispute with strangers about the family dog.

The granddaughter said the family's Yorkshire terrier recently escaped and wandered into a neighbor's yard. She said the neighbor returned the dog, but two other people claimed the dog belonged to them.

An argument ensued and that's when, the girl said, her grandmother was shot in the head.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) - Seven Ohio men have pleaded guilty to related crimes regarding child pornography and the sexual abuse of two 10-year-old children.

Four of the men were charged in a second superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury in August 2018, for crimes related to producing child pornography and the repeated sexual abuse of a 10-year-old girl.

They include: William G. Weekley, 35, of Newark; Timothy F. Sullivan, 50, of Canal Winchester; Franklin Eugene Perry, 63, of Columbus; and Brian S. Perkins, 42, of Mt. Vernon.

Three other defendants were discovered in the course of the investigation that was initiated by the discovery of Weekley’s activities.

Those three men were each charged in separate cases on Aug. 23, 2018.

Grant Michalski, 29, of Columbus, was charged by criminal complaint.

A federal grand jury charged Eric Zevely, 34, of Columbus, to offenses related to the production of child pornography and sexual abuse of another 10-year-old girl.

Finally, in a fourth case, Jordan I. Makowski, 33, of Greenville, Ohio, was indicted by a federal grand jury for distributing and receiving child pornography.

Benjamin C. Glassman, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, Todd A. Wickerham, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cincinnati Division, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, Steve Francis, Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin, Westerville Acting Police Chief Charles Chandler and other members of the FBI Crimes Against Children Task Force announced the pleas entered into before Chief U.S. District Judge Edmund A. Sargus, Jr.

This investigation began when Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations Special Agent/FBI Task Force Officer Larry McCoy communicated undercover with Weekley online.

From that initial investigation into Weekley, investigators were able to discover the additional defendants.

According to court documents, the defendants made online contact with each other and others who shared, or whom they believed to share, their sexual interest in minors, incest and child pornography.

After making initial contact through Craigslist, Weekley – who pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court today – communicated with each of the other defendants on an ongoing basis through text and various other apps, including Wickr.

Weekley had regular access to a female child (Jane Doe), who was approximately 10 to 11 years old during the offenses detailed.

Weekley sexually abused the girl and created images and videos of the molestation, which he shared with others, including some of the co-defendants.

Weekley and Perry discussed sexually abusing the girl together and made plans for Perry to join Weekley in the sexual abuse of Jane Doe.

Perry encouraged Weekley to continue abusing the victim and did eventually sexually abuse the victim together with Weekley.

Likewise, Perkins and Sullivan requested that Weekley bring Jane Doe to meet them for the purpose of sexually abusing Jane Doe, but it is not believed that Perkins or Sullivan actually met with Weekley.

One of the conversations found on Weekley’s phone between him and Sullivan was initiated when Weekley responded to an online classified ad Sullivan posted entitled “I AM LOOKING TO PRIVATELY MEET AN INCEST FAMILY. Mom son brother sister.”

Weekley and Michalski messaged on Craigslist about interests in sexual topics like “family, forced” and “K9 and more.”

Zevely engaged in thousands of communications with numerous other individuals in response to ads placed on Craigslist, including with Weekley.

Investigators discovered Zevely sexually abused a different 10-year-old victim who was not Jane Doe. Zevely also engaged in communications about sexually abusing minors with both HSI and FBI undercover task force officers.

In a conversation on Kik messenger, Makowski sent several files containing child pornography to another individual.

Weekley pleaded guilty Thursday to three counts of production of child pornography (15 to 30 years in prison), one count of attempted coercion of a minor (10 years to life in prison) and two counts of distributing child pornography (five to 20 years in prison).

Sullivan pleaded guilty on Tuesday to attempted coercion or enticement of a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity (10 years to life in prison).

Perry pleaded guilty in January 2019 to coercion or enticement of a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity (10 years to life in prison).

Perkins, Zevely and Michalski all pleaded guilty in November 2018. Perkins and Michalski pleaded guilty to receipt of child pornography (five to 20 years in prison), and Zevely pleaded guilty to producing child pornography (15 to 30 years in prison).

Makowski pleaded guilty in February 2019 to distributing child pornography (five to 20 years in prison).

990,"Deputies: Woman who fatally struck girl didn't have driver's license, had expired visa","0 Deputies: Woman who fatally struck girl didn't have driver's license, had expired visa

POLK COUNTY, Fla. - A 25-year-old Argentinean woman who fatally struck a 13-year-old girl Wednesday morning did not have a valid driver's license and was living in the United States on an expired visa, the Polk County Sheriff's Office said.

Deputies said Mariana Perez Borroto, of Kissimmee, was bicycling to Lake Marion Creek Middle School shortly after 7:45 a.m. when she was hit by a minivan being driven by Micaela Coronel on Homosassa Road.

Investigators said Borroto, who was critically injured, was flown to Orlando's Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital, where she died. She would have turned 14 in two weeks.

TRENDING NOW:

Coronel said she had been living in Kissimmee since October on a ""visitor pass"" and provided deputies an Argentinian identification card, but she did not have a valid driver's license in either country, deputies said.

Coronel said that about 80 percent of her windshield was covered in condensation when she struck Borroto, investigators said. They said she was driving her child to school when she crashed.

""She should have thought about the impact on her family before she operated that motor vehicle without a license, without cleaning the windshield,"" Sheriff Grady Judd said. ""She was careless. She was negligent, and there's a 13-year-old child (who is) dead today.""

Coronel was arrested on charges of operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver's license causing death.

Judd said she will be sentenced and deported should she be convicted.

Lake Marion Creek Middle School Principal Johna Jozwiak released the following statement:

""Our hearts are broken today. We are devastated by the loss of a very special member of our Lake Marion Creek Middle family. Mariana was a bright and sweet-natured girl who possessed a very polite and calm manner. She enjoyed studying history and loved spending her free time sketching in notebooks. We are devastated by this tragic news. Counselors are available at school for students and staff members. We have also rescheduled the rest of this week's Florida Standards Assessments testing to next week.""

The crash remains under investigation.

""This suspect killed a 13 yr old middle schooler who was riding her bike to school this AM, while driving without a license. This senseless tragedy should never have occurred!"" - Sheriff Judd

MANATEE COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - Dominick Hawkins has been found guilty of kidnapping and sexual battery on minor.

In 2013, prosecutors say Hawkins approached a 5-year-old girl at the Wayside Glen mobile home park in Bradenton.

Prosecutors say he offered to buy the girl candy.

The pair was captured on surveillance camera inside a convenience store.

“After she got the candy she wanted to go home, but the man told her he was having a party at his house,” said prosecutor Ashley Dusnik.

Instead, he lured her to an abandoned trailer.

Officials say after he assaulted her, he ran to a nearby bus, frantically trying to leave the area.

“She put her pants back on. Tried to exit the trailer, when she found she couldn’t go out the door, she crawled out a window,” said Dusnik.

He has been sentenced to life in prison.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/dominik-hawkins-found-guilty-of-kidnapping-sexual-battery-on-minor/1900631938,2019-04-04T21:34:36Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
992,Police: 10-year-old girl dies after apparent road-rage shooting in Phoenix,"PHOENIX (FOX 10/AP) - Police say a 10-year-old girl has died after she and her father were both shot outside their home during a possible road-rage shooting in Phoenix on April 3.

According to a statement released by Sgt. Vince Lewis, a family of four was driving near 37th Avenue and Portland Street when they noticed a white Ford F-150 with dark-colored trim was following them.

As they turned onto Moreland Street where they lived, the truck continued following them. When they turned into their driveway, the truck stopped and the driver fired several gunshots at them.

“They were traveling westbound on Moreland and turned into their residence and that’s when the driver or someone from the pickup truck opened fire to the car,"" said Sgt. Lewis. ""The father and daughter were struck by gunfire.”

A 30-year-old man driving the vehicle and his daughter, identified by police as Summerbell Brown, were both shot.

The mother and a second daughter who were also in the vehicle weren't injured.

Neighbors who did not want to go on camera say several shots were heard.

""Just knowing that all the family is there and for them to do that, it’s just sad,"" said one person.

Police say the suspect, identified as a 30-to-40-year-old man, remains on the loose.

MARTIN COUNTY — An 18-year-old Hobe Sound man is accused of inappropriately touching a 14-year-old girl multiple times and giving her marijuana.

Zachary Stockman, of the 8300 block of Southeast Pinehaven Avenue, was arrested Tuesday on four counts of felony lewd or lascivious battery on a child younger than 15, one charge of delivering marijuana to a child and felony possession of LSD.

Deputies said in February they were called to the girl's home when her parents went to check on her and didn't find her in her room. The girl's parents told deputies they then called her, and she told them she was with Stockman.

Deputies said based on what the girl told them, they obtained a search warrant for Stockman's home and found 56 Xanax pills and ecstasy.

Stockman was arrested and taken to the Martin County Jail, where he remained Thursday afternoon on $135,000 bail.

994,"Sheriff: Woman driving without license hits, kills 13-year-old girl on way to school","- A woman who was driving without a valid license is accused of fatally hitting a 13-year-old girl Wednesday morning as the teen was riding her bike to school.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office arrested 25-year-old Micaela Coronel from Argentina. Investigators said she had been staying in the Kissimmee area.

According to deputies, Coronel was driving a minivan around 7:50 a.m. Wednesday when she struck 13-year-old Mariana Perez Borroto in the Poinciana/Kissimmee area.

The eighth grader was on her way to Lake Marion Creek Middle School when she was hit. Borroto was airlifted to Orlando's Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital, where she later died.

Coronel told deputies she has been in the U.S. on a ""visitor pass"" since October of 2018. She presented an Argentinian identification card to investigators.

""She does not have a Florida driver's license, and deputies determined through their investigation that she does not have a valid driver's license at all,"" the sheriff's office said.

Deputies said condensation covered approximately 80% of Coronel's windshield at the time of the crash, obstructing her view.

""This suspect should not have even been behind the wheel of a vehicle. This is an awful, senseless tragedy that should never have occurred,"" said Sheriff Grady Judd in a statement. ""This beautiful child should be turning 14 years old in just two weeks, but for this suspect's illegal actions. Mariana's family and friends are in our prayers.""

Coronel has been charged with operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver's license causing death, a third-degree felony.

The principal of Lake Marion Creek Middle School released the following statement:

HOLIDAY, Fla. (WFLA) - A St. Petersburg man is facing charges in Pasco County after deputies say he tried to pick up a teenage girl for sex in exchange for money and gifts.

Deputies arrested 45-year-old Kevin Balardini Tuesday morning at Anclote High School. According to an arrest report, two staff members at the school saw him circling the parking lot in his car and contacted deputies because they were suspicious.

Responding deputies learned Balardini was at the school trying to pick up a 16-year-old girl for sex. The arrest report states the girl previously agreed to have sex with Balardini for $100 but later agreed to have him purchase a vaping device for her.

A condom and male enhancement pills were found in Balardini's car, deputies say. The arrest report says he had been in contact with the victim via text and had prior interaction on a previous date.

The victim's mother told deputies she does not know Balardini and confirmed he is not allowed to pick the girl up from school. Deputies say the victim is a known ""habitual runaway"" who flees to the St. Petersburg area to hide.

997,1 of 3 gunmen in shootout that killed 7-year-old girl pleads guilty,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - One of the men charged in a shootout that killed a 7-year-old Jacksonville girl last August has opted to plead guilty in the case.

Trevonte Phoenix had been facing felony murder and weapons charges in connection with the Westside gun battle that ended the life of Heidy Rivas Villanueva.

Phoenix pleaded guilty to second-degree felony murder. He will be sentenced later. He faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years but could spend the rest of his life in prison.

Heidy and her family were caught in the crossfire that unfolded in the parking lot of a Westside strip mall after a botched robbery, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

Heidy, who was shot in the head, did not survive.

“She was loving, kind, happy, beautiful,"" Heidy's mother, Angelica Villanueva, said Wednesday through a victim advocate translator. “She always wanted to keep the family together.”

She said Heidy dreamed of being a doctor, or even a police officer, in hopes of keeping her family safe.

Villanueva told News4Jax that she believes Phoenix is remorseful, and that he wrote her family a letter, which she said she has read.

Police said Phoenix and another man, named Abrion Price, had arranged a gun sale near the strip mall, but they actually planned to rob the buyer. They ended up trading gunfire with Stanley Harris, a friend of the buyer, police said.

Investigators said a bullet from Harris' gun struck Heidy, killing her. Because police said Phoenix and Price were committing a crime when Heidy was killed, they were each charged with felony murder, under Florida law.

Harris faces a third-degree murder charge.

A fourth man, Edward Garcia, who was charged as a getaway driver, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to a first-degree felony and is awaiting sentencing.

According to police, Garcia’s involvement was showing up at the scene to pick up Price and Phoenix as the gun battle played out. His mother’s vehicle was struck by gunfire during the shooting.

His mother, Kezia Holmes, is charged with evidence tampering. She’s accused of taking the vehicle to a repair shop to get the windshield replaced, despite knowing it was involved in a crime. She is awaiting trial.

Price and Harris have pleaded not guilty to their charges. They are awaiting trial.

1000,2 Polk couples recount harrowing ordeal aboard Viking Sky cruise ship trapped off coast of Norway,"Mark Hofstad and Carol Burlingham of Lakeland and Dale and Marcia Smith of Winter Haven were among 1,373 passengers and crew members aboard the Viking Sky cruise ship that made international headlines.

LAKELAND — Two Polk County couples shared the harrowing experience of being trapped off the coast of Norway while howling winds, rain and 26-foot waves battered their drifting cruise ship.

Mark Hofstad and Carol Burlingham of Lakeland and Dale and Marcia Smith of Winter Haven were among the 1,373 passengers and crew members aboard the Viking Sky cruise ship that made international headlines in late March when its engines failed and the ship narrowly averted striking the rocky Norwegian coast.

Remarkably both couples heaped praise instead of recriminations on the company and the ship's crew weeks later when sharing their experiences with The Ledger.

“The bottom line is that we viewed this as an adventure,” said Hofstad, 67, who retired as a judge on the 10th Judicial Circuit Court in Bartow in January after seven and a half years on the bench. “We probably would not cruise any other cruise line.”

Burlingham and the Smiths agreed.

“We were and still are Viking supporters; we're advocates,” said Dale Smith, 70, who retired as the Winter Haven city manager in 2013 after 37 years with the city.

The positive feedback came even after both women compared their experiences to probably the most famous cruise ship disaster, the 1912 sinking of the Titanic.

“That's when I got scared. It was like the Titanic,” said Marcia Smith, 67, the retired nutrition director for Polk County Schools, describing her feelings at a crucial point. “Even though it was a harrowing experience, the way we were treated proved we made the right choice.”

The following is a capsule version of events based on the accounts of all four people supplemented by news media reports.

'In Search of the Northern Lights'

Swiss-based Viking, which offers river and ocean cruises mostly on European waters, advertised this trip on its 4-year-old ocean liner, Sky, under the title “In Search of the Northern Lights.”

A Minnesota native who briefly resided in Alaska, Hofstad knew the Northern Lights well, but his wife did not.

“I had never seen them. I'm a Florida girl,” said Burlingham, 65, who retired in 2016 as an assistant state attorney after 27 years at the 10th Circuit.

The Smiths also took the cruise because they had never encountered nature's light show.

The Sky set sail March 14 from Bergen, Norway, and passengers saw the Northern Lights a couple nights later.

But the ship ran into a storm on Friday night, March 22, and into the next morning while sailing off the Norwegian coast.

Sailing was “a little choppy, but not what you wouldn't expect,” Burlingham said.

The weather calmed down after dawn Saturday, but around noon it sailed into another storm with wind gusts up to 43 mph and waves of more than 26 feet, according to Norwegian media sources.

Dale Smith could see the seas churning as the couple ate lunch, he said.

“I'm an engineer, and I could measure them. They were 25 feet,” said Smith, who holds a civil engineering degree.

Shortly after noon, all four local passengers agreed they could hear that the engines had shut down. The Sky also lost all power except for emergency lighting.

Then furniture started sliding across the decks.

Hofstad was in the Explorations Lounge on one of the top decks. All the furniture, save for a piano bolted to the floor, started sliding around and bottles and glasses were tumbling from the shelves, he said.

“It got rough, and it got progressively more rough,” Hofstad said.

By then the Smiths had returned to their cabin, where they and the furniture also were buffeted about.

“You could hear the glass breaking and bathroom things were falling off the shelves,” Dale Smith said.

At one point, an apparently big wave hit and flung him across the cabin.

“I went across the room and hit a door,” said Dale Smith, who was not injured. “When the next wave hit, it took the bed against the closet. All the furniture shifted to one side of the room.”

Then an alarm sounded, and passengers were told to proceed to their assigned assembly, or “muster,” areas that they knew from drills before the ship sailed. The more than 900 passengers were divided between two muster areas.

Both couples went to the same muster area, a large dining hall on one side of the ship.

'It was very Titanic-like'

Up to that point, the Smiths, Burlingham and Hofstad agreed they were concerned but not frightened. All four credited the calmness of the crew with preventing a general panic.

That Titanic moment came in the muster area.

A wave crashed into that side of the ship, blowing a metal door off its hinges. That apparently triggered a sensor that automatically opened the windows, which would have provided an escape route but let more water in, Dale Smith said.

“I heard a great big bang, and all of the sudden a wall of water was coming through. It was very Titanic-like,” said Burlingham, who was with Hofstad at the front of the hall near the doorway.

The water knocked many people off their feet and sent them sliding across the floor toward the other end of the hall, Hofstad and Burlingham said.

“When the water came in, there was a lot of screaming,” Hofstad said.

Burlingham got pinned against a wall by a sliding table and couldn't breathe, she said.

“I got it away from me to the point where I could breathe, but I didn't dare push it forward because people were under it,” Burlingham said.

The Smiths were at the other end of the hall, where they could see and hear the incident, but they escaped the surging water because most of it went down a stairwell in front of them. Still both reported feeling the premature end of their cruise was nigh.

“That's when I thought we were going to sink,” Dale Smith said. “My only concern was that I couldn't say good-bye to my kids.”

“We took each other's hands and said (silently), 'This is it,' ” Marcia Smith said.

But the couples agreed the room quickly calmed down after the incident, again crediting the crew's calm reaction.

“Then things settled down, and there was no panic after that,” Hofstad said.

“Everyone was calm. There was no stampeding,” Dale Smith said. “There wasn't any yelling; there wasn't any screaming; there wasn't any pushing. Everyone was orderly. It confirmed your faith in humanity.”

In short order, passengers moved from the muster area into an adjoining hallway behind another water-tight door. Eventually they would be evacuated by helicopter.

The evacuation became another ordeal itself.

'Go toward the light'

The Smiths said they thought the helicopters would land on the ship or passengers would be lifted up in a large basket. Instead, the Norwegian Coast Guard evacuated one by one, fitting each passenger with a harness attached to a steel cable that was hoisted up to the helicopter.

Only about half the passengers chose that option.

“If we had time to think about it, we probably wouldn't have done it,” Marcia Smith said.

The seas were still choppy, the ship swaying and the helicopter had to move with it to keep the cable in place until a passenger could be hooked up. The noise from the sea and helicopter eliminated any conversations, and Coast Guard seaman communicated through eye and hand gestures.

Both couples also praised the professionalism of the Norwegian Coast Guard under such dangerous conditions.

“Those guys knew what they were doing. They were focused,” Dale Smith said.

The Smiths said they spent four hours on the ship until the airlift.

Hofstad and Burlingham estimated they spent six hours, which meant they were evacuated after nightfall. A high-powered lamp from the bottom of the helicopter provided the only illumination.

On the way up, Burlingham said, “I kept thinking: Go toward the light. Go toward the light.”

The couples also rained effusive praise on the Norwegian people, who cared for them once they made it to land and into hotels. The Norwegian Red Cross gave each person about $300 in local currency to buy new clothes, personal items and other needs. Viking paid for hotel rooms.

Viking also refunded the cost of the cruise, about $10,000 each depending upon accommodations, side trips and other variables, and gave every passenger vouchers for two free additional cruises in the future.

“Those people in Norway are the salt of the earth,” Marcia Smith said. “I hope some day we get the chance to go back to the community and thank them personally.”

1004,Anti-human trafficking nonprofit warns about teen trafficking,"Deputies say a registered sex offender 45-year-old Juan Cresencio Matos is now behind bars for subjecting a 16-year-old foster kid to human trafficking.

The police report says the girl was reported missing more than 10 times last year, each time found by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office with an older man.

The report says Matos sent a series of texts to the girl’s cell phone requesting sexual services.

Human trafficking experts say this is why the first 24 hours are crucial for kids who are reported missing, like runaways.

That’s because experts say that’s when the chances they may become a human trafficking victim are the highest.

Lynne Barletta, the Founder of Catch the Wave of Hope, hopes human trafficking victims work through their trauma.

“In Florida, human trafficking is rampant,” she said.

Barletta also uses the pictures as a tool to warn teens.

“This is a picture of a gift with a hook,"" she said. ""And my question to you do people is what would it take to bait you?""

Barletta says it’s a favorite tactic among human traffickers who start off with a non-threatening, friendly persona when approaching missing kids.

“These children are terrifically vulnerable and traffickers prey on vulnerability,” she said.

Barletta says the first 24 hours is crucial that’s when a trafficker will use bait to earn the kid’s trust.

“Something as simple as a meal is traded for sex or a place to stay,” she said.

Barletta says the trafficker will pose as a wolf in sheep’s clothing becoming whatever the child needs them to be.

She says that’s why she urges teens to stay alert and suspicious of people’s intentions.",http://cw34.com/news/local/anti-human-trafficking-nonprofit-warns-about-teen-trafficking,2019-04-05T23:36:45Z,WTVX,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407

A 10-year-old girl was fatally shot and her father was wounded in their driveway in what may have started with a traffic dispute, Phoenix police said Thursday.Sgt. Vince Lewis said the shooting that killed Summerbell Brown occurred Wednesday night when a man in a pickup truck who had been following the family’s car fired several gunshots after they arrived at their home.The girl’s mother, who was in the front passenger seat, and sister were not injured.The driver of the pickup then fled.Lewis said the fact that the pickup was closely following the victims’ vehicle might indicate there’d been a traffic dispute. He said there was no immediate indication that the family and the shooter knew each other.“It’s possible that this was a road rage that started earlier in the area prior to the victim’s family arriving at home,” Lewis told KTAR .The father, Dharquintium Brown, told TV station KTVK-TV that the shooting occurred after he got out of the car to confront the man who was following his car. ""He was ready to start shooting. I got out my vehicle and I asked them, 'What's going on, what's up?' because he stopped at my house,"" Dharquintium Brown told KNXV. ""And he just got to firing. And he shot my car and he shot me right here and he shot up my house and he killed my daughter.""While police initially described Brown as critically wounded, he told the station he wasn’t badly injured.""I looked at him dead in the face, he had this deranged look, like, he looked like he was high on something. His pupils were dilated. And as soon as he -- as soon as I looked at him in his eyes, he just 'boom boom boom boom boom' -- through through the car. He didn't even reach the gun outside the window, he shot through his door,"" the victim's mother, Taniesha Brown, said.The girl was taken to a hospital where she was pronounced dead.Dharquintium Brown said the family was working with police on a composite sketch of the suspect. Police have since released footage from a nearby surveillance camera that shows a white pickup closely following the family’s car around 5:45 p.m.The shooter is described as a Hispanic man between 30 and 40 years old wearing a long-sleeve orange shirt. He was believed to be driving a white Ford F150 pickup with dark trim on the bottom. The vehicle has scrapes and damage on its left side above the rear tire, police said.Family members remember Summerbell Brown as a straight-A student who loved dancing and gymnastics. ""This is just heartbreaking. And I'm going to miss her every day, think about her every day. This nightmare is going to replay in my head every day. I can't sleep. I just hope she is at peace.

1006,Toddler in remission after beating stage 4 cancer,"- At just 21-months-old, Molly Hughes has overcome more than most adults.

When she was 4-months-old, the adorable little girl from Warren County, Kentucky was diagnosed with stage IV neuroblastoma.

Her mother, Chelsea Hughes tells Fox 35 they were caught completely off guard.

""We had no idea she even possibly had cancer. After the CT scan, they found a softball size tumor in her abdomen.""

From there, 15 months of grueling cancer treatments began--all before Molly could even walk.

""She went through 5 rounds of chemo, surgery, 2 stem cell transplants , 12 days of radiation and 6 rounds of immunotherapy. It was the worst year and a half of our lives.""

But it all paid off when the family got the call they’ve been waiting for: Molly was cancer-free.

""OH HAPPY DAY!!!!"" her mother wrote in a Facebook post. ""Molly has some BIG news to share!!! Her scans were clear & showed no evidence of disease!! (NED!!!) There is NO active cancer left in her little body!!""

Now instead of surgery and radiation, Molly will be spending her days just how a toddler should: playing outside and just enjoying life.

On Monday, little Molly will start a trial drug for 2 years that will help prevent a relapse. In the meantime, the family is planning a trip to Florida to celebrate the wonderful news--and it will be Molly's first time taking a swim!

1008,Families of missing children find new hope in old cases,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Years after their disappearances, the families of local missing children continue to climb to the hope that they’ll be reunited with their loved ones someday.

More than 424,000 children were reported missing in the U.S. in 2018, according to FBI figures. Over the years, hundreds of kids have vanished from Florida. Many of those cases remain unsolved.

As we've learned from new developments in several high-profile missing children's cases, sometimes families find the closure they're desperately looking for, but it doesn't always turn out that way.

That's the story in the case of Timmothy Pitzen, who disappeared in Illinois nearly eight years ago after his mother took her own life. On Wednesday, a teen turned up in Kentucky, saying he was Pitzen and he'd been held captive for years by two men. Sadly, investigators debunked that theory on Thursday.

On the other hand, a Utah girl who'd been missing for a year was found safe Wednesday in Lake City. Authorities said Ariana Bozeman was kidnapped by her mother, who had lost custody. Bozeman has now been reunited with her father, who's mapped out a road trip back home so the two can reconnect.

In the Jacksonville area, several cases still remain unsolved. Cases like that of HaLeigh Cummings, a Putnam County girl reported missing from her Satsuma home when she was just five years old. Or that of Mark Degner and Bryan Hayes, who were ages 12 and 13 when they disappeared from Jacksonville.

SPECIAL COVERAGE: HaLeigh Cummings disappeared 10 years ago

These are cases that boggle the mind as all three children seemingly vanished without a trace. Now, America's most prolific real-life crime fighter is examining the evidence in their cases in search of the answers that have eluded loved ones for more than a decade.

Degner & Hayes

Mark Degner and Bryan Hayes vanished in February 2005 after they walked out of Paxon Middle School on Jacksonville’s Westside. They haven’t been seen since, leaving their families heartbroken and anxious to this day.

""It’s hard, you know?"" said Linda Holland, Mark’s mother. ""When you think about it, you start crying. And you try to be brave for your kids. Because I have other kids. And I try to be brave for them to make them not feel as bad.""

HaLeigh Cummings

Exactly four years after the two Jacksonville boys went missing, another unsolved mystery gripped the Northeast Florida community and the nation as a whole.

HaLeigh Cummings was five years old when she was reported missing from her Satsuma home. Her father's girlfriend, Misty Croslin, was looking after HaLeigh at the time.

She told investigators she woke up to find the back door of the family's home propped open with a cinder block and HaLeigh gone.

Investigators spent years looking for HaLeigh, with their efforts taking them as far away as Nebraska as they chased down every lead. But despite rampant speculation and rumors about what happened to the girl, the case eventually ran cold. Though she's presumed dead, her loved ones remain hopeful.

John Walsh's mission

As the years go by, the tips and leads become fewer and farther between. America’s top TV crime fighter, however, hasn’t forgotten about the cases.

""I say never give up,"" John Walsh said. ""The National Center [For Missing and Exploited Children] never gives up. I never give up on missing children. I have broken some of the longest term cases and gotten them back.""

News4Jax spoke with Walsh about keeping local cases alive. He hosted “America’s Most Wanted” on Fox from 1998 to 2012. He now hosts ""The Hunt with John Walsh"" on CNN.

Walsh grew to fame in 1981 when his son Adam, 6, was abducted from the Hollywood Mall in South Florida. The body was found murdered two weeks later. Police officially closed the case in 2008, linking the slaying to deceased serial killer Ottis Toole of Jacksonville.

""And of course we're dying of broken hearts, but we’re opening that mail for months and months,"" Walsh said. ""It was people that had runaway kids, people who had missing children, people who had murdered children, people who had been victims of non-custodial parental abduction -- [there was] nothing to help them.""

That’s what inspired Walsh and his wife, Revé, to start the Adam Walsh Center, which became the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. It’s headquartered in Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C., but it has regional offices across the country.

In March, they opened a nationwide tipline call center, 1-800-THE-MISSING, based in Palm Beach County, the site of the original Adam Walsh center. There, case workers know every call could be the big break investigators need. Callers can remain anonymous.

Families find hope

“​When Kamiyah was found, you know, obviously we were ecstatic,” said Bob Lowery, NCMEC’s missing children’s supervisor.

Lowery remembers getting the tip that led police to Kamiyah Mobley. She was abducted as an infant from a Jacksonville hospital in 1998 and discovered 18 years later living under the alias Alexis Manigo with her abductor in South Carolina.

Mobley’s case brings hope for the families of HaLeigh, Mark, Bryan and so many more missing kids.

""Never give up hope,"" Lowery said about families who still don’t have answers about their missing loved ones. ""We've seen remarkable stories like this in the past.""

He's talking about stories like that of Elizabeth Smart, who was abducted in 2002 and found in 2003, and Jaycee Dugard, who was kidnapped in 1991 and found in 2009.

Age progression

The NCMEC uses a talented team of artists for age progression. The organization provides the service free of charge to law enforcement agencies investigating missing persons cases.

Age progression renderings show what Degner and Hayes could look like in their mid-20’s. The team just refreshed a simulated picture of HaLeigh Cummings, who would now be 15 years old.

""We consider these age progessions beacons of hope for these families,"" said Collin McNally, age progression supervisor for NCMEC.

""As long as a child is still out there, we’ll update these every two years,"" he added. ""After they turn 18, we’ll update them every five years.""

Never give up

For the local families still without answers, giving up is not an option.

“I just hope that one day they’re going to come to the door and say 'I am here, I’m alive, I’m OK,"" said Degner’s mother, Linda Holland. ""I love him. And no matter what he has been through or he has gone through, I just want him to be be safe and sound. To see his face for once.""

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) - Kidnapped at gunpoint, beaten, then taken to the St. Petersburg police station.

A 15-year-old girl is recovering from her ordeal. Her accused attacker claims she stole his car, so he took it upon himself to take her to the cops.

April 1 around 6 p.m., at the Harbordale Park off 6th Street South in St. Petersburg, is where the drama unfolded.

“The girl jumped out. She was running towards the park. He jumped out and ran after her,” said witness Tracey Clark.

He caught the tail end of the events from his porch.

“I stood there and I watched. I just thought there were like, oh a little lover's quarrel, whatever. And then they sped off real fast, like zoom,” said Clark.

St. Petersburg police tell us Mi'keal Davis, 24, believed he'd found who had taken his car the night prior.

“This individual targeted a 15-year-old girl. Tracked her down. Chased her and forced her into a car at gunpoint,” said police department spokeswoman Sandra Bentil.

Arrest documents say Davis, wearing a black mask, hit the teen with the gun before kidnapping her near the park.

The same documents say Davis took the teen to a place where other females punched and kicked her. He then drove her to the police station to turn her in for auto theft.

Tracey Clark said in the car, the teen put up quite a fight.

“She was punching him real, like, punching him. She's just punching him, trying to get away,” he said.

Doctors at All Children's Hospital treated her.

Cops busted Davis at the police station.

“These are very serious charges. We never advocate for anyone to take the law into their own hands,” said Bentil.

St. Petersburg police are still putting the pieces together and would like to speak to anybody else who saw what happened.

1011,"13-year-old Polk girl dies after minivan strikes her bicycle; Mariana Perez Borroto was on her way to school when hit, PCSO says","A 13-year-old Polk girl is dead after she was struck by a minivan while riding her bicycle to school. Authorities say Micaela Coronel, who is in the country on a ""visitor pass,"" was driving without a valid driver's license when she hit Mariana Perez Borroto.

KISSIMMEE — Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies arrested 25-year-old Micaela Coronel of Kissimmee on charges of operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver license causing death, a third-degree felony, after she fatally struck 13-year-old Mariana Perez Borroto on Tuesday morning.

Coronel ""failed to use care"" when driving, hitting Borroto with her vehicle, according to PCSO reports.

According to the arrest affidavit, the crash occurred around 7:50 a.m.

Borroto, an 8th grader at Lake Marion Creek Middle School in Kissimmee/Poinciana, was riding her bicycle to school when she was hit by the Chrysler Town & Country minivan headed eastbound on Homosassa Road.

The teen was critically injured and airlifted to Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital in Orlando, where she later succumbed to her injuries, said the Sheriff's Office in a prepared media release Wednesday.

Coronel told deputies she's been in the country on a ""visitor pass"" from Argentina since October, and presented them with an Argentinian identification card, according to reports. She does not have a Florida driver's license, and deputies determined through their investigation that she does not have a valid driver's license at all.

Coronel told deputies that at the time of the crash, condensation covered approximately 80% of her windshield, obstructing her view while she was driving, according to reports.

Other factors that may have contributed to the crash are being investigated, said the Sheriff's Office. The investigation is ongoing.

The PCSO is checking with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to determine her status in the country, due to the fact that she's committed a felony, according to reports.

""This suspect should not have even been behind the wheel of a vehicle. This is an awful, senseless tragedy that should never have occurred,"" Sheriff Grady Judd said. ""This beautiful child should be turning 14 years old in just two weeks, but for this suspect's illegal actions. Mariana's family and friends are in our prayers.""

Johna Jozwiak, the principal at Lake Marion Creek Middle, said, ""Our hearts are broken today. We are devastated by the loss of a very special member of our Lake Marion Creek Middle family. Mariana was a bright and sweet-natured girl who possessed a very polite and calm manner. She enjoyed studying history and loved spending her free time sketching in notebooks. We are devastated by this tragic news.""

Counselors are available at school for students and staff members, said Jozwiak. The rest of this week's Florida Standards Assessments testing has been rescheduled to next week, she said.

April 1 around 6 p.m., at the Harbordale Park off 6th Street South in St. Petersburg, is where the drama unfolded.

“The girl jumped out. She was running towards the park. He jumped out and ran after her,” said witness Tracey Clark.

He caught the tail end of the events from his porch.

“I stood there and I watched. I just thought there were like, oh a little lover's quarrel, whatever. And then they sped off real fast, like zoom,” said Clark.

St. Petersburg police tell us Mi'keal Davis, 24, believed he'd found who had taken his car the night prior.

“This individual targeted a 15-year-old girl. Tracked her down. Chased her and forced her into a car at gunpoint,” said police department spokeswoman Sandra Bentil.

Arrest documents say Davis, wearing a black mask, hit the teen with the gun before kidnapping her near the park.

The same documents say Davis took the teen to a place where other females punched and kicked her. He then drove her to the police station to turn her in for auto theft.

Tracey Clark said in the car, the teen put up quite a fight.

“She was punching him real, like, punching him. She's just punching him, trying to get away,” he said.

Doctors at All Children's Hospital treated her.

Cops busted Davis at the police station.

“These are very serious charges. We never advocate for anyone to take the law into their own hands,” said Bentil.

St. Petersburg police are still putting the pieces together and would like to speak to anybody else who saw what happened.

Davis is being held at the Pinellas County Jail on $150,000 bond.",https://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/st-petersburg-man-accused-of-kidnapping-teen-claims-she-stole-his-car/1898717053,2019-04-04T00:24:28Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

1014,13-year-old Polk girl dies after car strikes her bicycle,"A minivan driven by a woman in the country on a ""visitor pass"" from Argentina and with no valid driver license struck and killed 13-year-old Mariana Perez Borroto on her way to school.

KISSIMMEE — Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies arrested 25-year-old Micaela Coronel of Kissimmee on charges of operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver license causing death, a third-degree felony, after she fatally struck 13-year-old Mariana Perez Borroto on Tuesday morning.

Coronel ""failed to use care"" when driving, hitting Borroto with her vehicle, according to PCSO reports.

According to the arrest affidavit, the crash occurred around 7:50 a.m.

Borroto, an 8th grader at Lake Marion Creek Middle School in Kissimmee/Poinciana, was riding her bicycle to school when she was hit by the Chrysler Town & Country minivan headed eastbound on Homosassa Road.

The teen was critically injured and airlifted to Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital in Orlando, where she later succumbed to her injuries, said the Sheriff's Office in a prepared media release Wednesday.

Coronel told deputies she's been in the country on a ""visitor pass"" from Argentina since October, and presented them with an Argentinian identification card, according to reports. She does not have a Florida driver license, and deputies determined through their investigation that she does not have a valid driver license at all.

Coronel told deputies that at the time of the crash, condensation covered approximately 80% of her windshield, obstructing her view while she was driving, according to reports.

Other factors that may have contributed to the crash are being investigated, said the Sheriff's Office. The investigation is ongoing.

The PCSO is checking with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to determine her status in the country, due to the fact that she's committed a felony, according to reports.

""This suspect should not have even been behind the wheel of a vehicle. This is an awful, senseless tragedy that should never have occurred,"" Sheriff Grady Judd said. ""This beautiful child should be turning 14 years old in just two weeks, but for this suspect's illegal actions. Mariana's family and friends are in our prayers.""

Johna Jozwiak, the principal at Lake Marion Creek Middle, said, ""Our hearts are broken today. We are devastated by the loss of a very special member of our Lake Marion Creek Middle family. Mariana was a bright and sweet-natured girl who possessed a very polite and calm manner. She enjoyed studying history and loved spending her free time sketching in notebooks. We are devastated by this tragic news.""

Counselors are available at school for students and staff members, said Jozwiak. The rest of this week's Florida Standards Assessments testing has been rescheduled to next week, she said.

1017,Young victim testifies in Dominick Hawkins rape trial,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

MANATEE COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - On Tuesday, a brave little girl faced a jury and shared the shocking details of her rape six years ago.

Her alleged attacker, Dominick Hawkins is on trial for the crime.

In 2013, prosecutors say Dominick Hawkins approached a 5-year-old girl at the Wayside Glen mobile home park in Bradenton.

That girl is now 11-years-old and lives in Texas. But she clearly remembers that awful day.

Since she's a victim, we're concealing her identity.

She said on June 15, 2013, she was playing outside when a strange man came up to her.

""A guy came and then he said, ‘Do you want any candy?’ So I went to the store with him,” she recalled.

The pair was captured on surveillance video.

""I got a candy, and then I was going to go back home, but then he told me, ‘Do you want to go to a party?’” said the girl.

Soon after, he lured her to an abandoned trailer and attacked her.

""He kept choking me, I tried to kick him, but he threw me on the ground and then he raped me,” she said.

After describing the attack, the girl fought back tears.

Following the assault, she says Hawkins locked her in the trailer, so she plotted her escape.

“I said, ‘I don’t have enough time until he comes back.’ So I saw a window and it was opened a little, so I tried to fit through there and I got out and I ran back home,” said the girl.

A bus surveillance video then shows Hawkins frantically trying to leave town, the little girl can be seen running away.

If convicted, Hawkins, now 41, could face life in prison.

The trial is expected to wrap up by Friday.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/manatee-county/young-victim-testifies-in-dominick-hawkins-rape-trial/1894872468,2019-04-02T17:44:35Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

Local businesses have joined the movement to support the family of a child killed in Cape Coral last week and to help fulfill their demands to equip school bus stops with safety features such as benches, lights and bus stop monitors.

Layla Aiken, 8, was killed when a pickup truck struck her while she was waiting in the dark morning hours at her school bus stop with her older twin brothers in Cape Coral.

Authorities have seized the truck and identified a person of interest, but have yet to make an arrest more than a week after the fatal hit-and-run crash.

The response from the community has continued to grow in momentum, with community leaders demanding more safety features at bus stops and establishing fundraisers to facilitate the change.

1029,North Port teen arrested after crash involving 13 teenagers; 1 dead,"Some of the teenagers were riding on the roof of the SUV when it rolled over, police say

NORTH PORT — A 17-year-old girl is dead and three others were seriously injured after an SUV packed with teenagers, some of whom were riding atop the vehicle, rolled over in North Port early Saturday.

The driver, Stephanie Evrard, 19, a former Port Charlotte High School student, was arrested and charged with one count of DUI manslaughter, and three counts of DUI with personal injury, according to the North Port Police Department. She remained in the Sarasota County Jail Saturday afternoon.

Officers who responded to the intersection of Joewood Circle and Genip Court a little after 2:30 a.m. determined that 13 teenagers were piled into and onto the roof of the 2010 Toyota SUV Evrard was driving when she failed to navigate a curve, causing the vehicle to overturn.

The victim, who was not identified, was a North Port High School junior. Several other victims were classmates, police said.

Another 17-year-old passenger was treated at Sarasota Memorial Hospital and was later released, said Josh Taylor, a spokesman for the City of North Port. A 19-year-old male passenger is in surgery at Sarasota Memorial Hospital and a 13-year passenger is being treated at a Tampa area hospital with internal but non-life-threatening injuries.

Taylor said the names of the victims will not be released, citing Marsy’s law.

North Port High School canceled drama performances over the weekend and set up on-site counseling services for students from noon to 3 p.m. and during the school week. Students can also speak to a counselor anonymously by texting “HERE4U” to the crisis text line at 741741.

“This is a very sad day for everybody, the North Port community and the entire school district,” said Tracey Long Beeker, the director of communications for Sarasota County Schools.

Saturday’s crash comes at the heels of another fatal DUI case in North Port on March 24 that left two people dead after the inaugural game at the new Atlanta Braves spring training stadium.

The driver, Samantha King, 20, of North Port was charged with two counts of DUI manslaughter and five counts of DUI with property damage.

Drunk driving is an ongoing problem for Sarasota County, where the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles reported 29 fatal alcohol-related crashes from 2015 to 2017.

Sarasota County was also tagged in recent years for a high percentage of residents who self-identified as binge drinkers, according to an examination by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, a global health research group housed at the University of Washington.

Throughout the semester, Sarasota County schools routinely implement educational seminars and events to help curb teenage alcohol, tobacco and drug use, according to Beeker. However, no such seminar took place in the months leading up to Saturday’s crash.

Mothers Against Drunk Driving also routinely partners with local school districts to provide education efforts.

“We do all these things but it’s really about us,” said Larry Coggins, the executive director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. “But it starts at home with parents having a heart-to-heart with their teenagers to say it is inexcusable to drive anything but sober.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190406/north-port-teen-arrested-after-crash-involving-13-teenagers-1-dead?rssfeed=true,2019-04-06T13:25:53Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

After arriving at their Airbnb in Cork, Ireland, a family from New Zealand made an unsettling discovery: a hidden camera, livestreaming from the living room.Nealie and Andrew Barker, from Auckland, were in the midst of a 14-month trip around Europe when they arrived at the Airbnb property with their four children and niece.Once the family had unpacked, Andrew Barker, who works in IT security, scanned the house's Wi-Fi network.The scan unearthed a camera, and subsequently a live feed. From the angle of the video, the family tracked down the camera, concealed in what appeared to be a smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector.""It was such a shock. It was just a really horrible feeling,"" Nealie Barker told CNN.She called Airbnb to report the camera. ""They had no advice for us over the phone,"" she said. ""The girl just said that if you cancel within 14 days, you won't get your money back.""Next, Andrew Barker called the owner of the property. When confronted with the family's discovery, Nealie Barker said, the host hung up. Later, he called back, insisting the camera in the living room was the only one in the house.""We didn't feel relieved by that,"" she said, adding that the host refused to confirm whether he was recording the livestream or capturing audio.The family relocated to a nearby hotel and called Airbnb the following day. ""They still didn't seem to grasp the seriousness of the issue. They were treating it like a canceled booking,"" Nealie Barker said. Ultimately, Airbnb's trust and safety team promised to conduct an investigation, and it temporarily suspended the listing.According to Nealie Barker, Airbnb did not contact the family again. After she got through to them two weeks later, the company told her that the host had been ""exonerated"" and the listing reinstated.It was only after she posted about the incident on Facebook and local New Zealand news stations reported her experience that the host was permanently banned, she said.In a statement, Airbnb said: ""The safety and privacy of our community -- both online and offline -- is our priority. Airbnb policies strictly prohibit hidden cameras in listings and we take reports of any violations extremely seriously. We have permanently removed this bad actor from our platform.""""Our original handling of this incident did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves, and we have apologized to the family and fully refunded their stay. There have been over half a billion guest arrivals in Airbnb listings to date and negative incidents are incredibly rare.""The Barker family is currently in Budapest, where, Nealie Barker told CNN, ""We're staying in an Airbnb right now.""""We've become much more cautious now,"" she said, advising other travelers to learn how to scan networks for hidden cameras.

1032,Leave the pokeweed salad to the bugs and birds,"Les Harrison (Photo: UF/Leon County Extension Office)

Half a century ago the AM airwaves included a tune by a momentarily famous rock singer who crooned about Polk Salad Annie. While not exactly epic lyrics, it did have a catchy beat which made it to number eight on Billboard’s Hot 100.

The song described life of a poor girl and her family in the deep south of decades past. The Polk salad was a dining choice of last resort for those who were constrained financially, but had the skill to properly prepare this basic form of nutrition.

The basis of this dish was common pokeweed (Phytolacca americana), a native of North American perennial weed frequently found in pastures as well as fence-rows, fields, wooded areas and neglected residential landscapes.

The reason this plant is only on the menu of the economically distressed is all parts of it contain saponins, oxalates, and the alkaloid toxin phytolacine. The roots and seeds of this species contain the highest concentrations of these compounds.

The process for rendering the leaves edible by humans, or other mammals, involves boiling and washing with a second boiling and more washing. Short of eminent starvation, it is not a good or safe meal choice.

As winter moves to spring, this plant is emerging from its winter dormancy. The recent warm weather has accelerated the regrowth in Tallahassee and the surrounding counties.

Once pokeweed becomes established, it regrows each year from a large, fleshy taproot which penetrates over a foot deep. The crown of the root is where the plant is regenerated and can be as large as five and a half inches in diameter at the soil surface within two growing seasons.

Pokeweed usually has a red trunk like stem, which becomes hollow as the plant matures later in the year. Leaves become quite large as the plant grows to its full potential and are the basis for the Polk salad.

Pokeweed is currently emerging from last year’s roots and sprouting seed. Soon these plants will be head high with a thick covering of large leaves. (Photo: Les Harrison)

When in bloom the individual flowers appear green to white and are typically missing petals. Fruits are green when immature and turn a deep purple to black at maturity which is the basis for one alternate name for this species, inkberry.

Each fruit contains about nine small, hard-shelled seeds. Pokeweed can produce a few thousand seeds to over 48,000 seeds per plant annually.

In the right situation these seed may remain viable in the soil for over four decades. When exposed to favorable environmental conditions the seed sprout and the process is repeated.

While not a suitable selection for people or livestock, birds eat the fruits without much evidence of harm and are usually the means for seed dispersal. Roosting sites along fence rows and under utility lines frequently show signs of seed deposits.

In addition to feeding cardinals, mocking birds, cedar waxwings and other avian species, the pokeweed is host to a variety of insects. Some are beneficial and others are not.

A number of caterpillars utilize this weed to sustain their larval stage of development. Unfortunately, some other less desirable insects use the local weed, too.

Pokeweed can act as reservoirs of various viruses transmitted by insects which are destructive to vegetable and ornamental plants. Whiteflies and aphids are the main culprits, but other insect species can contribute the disease issue.

Old rock tunes aside, it is best to leave the pokeweed and Polk salad to the bugs and birds.

1033,Barack Obama still believes Biden would be 'an excellent president' amid allegations,"- Former President Barack Obama is staying silent on allegations surrounding Joe Biden, but he still has his ex-VP’s back, a new report claims.

Obama hasn’t commented publicly on allegations from a number of women that the former vice president touched them inappropriately.

But someone close to Obama said the former president still views Biden as someone who could be an “excellent” commander-in-chief, according to a new report.

“He's spent an infinite amount of time talking about his character, and they remain in touch and good friends,” a source close to the former president said, The Hill reported.

“President Obama thinks the world of him and thinks he'd be an excellent president.”

The source reportedly continued: “President Obama is not going to be weighing in on the primary and the day-to-day stories around it.

“And Joe Biden would be the first to tell you that he'll have to earn the nomination on his own.”

The report comes as Biden prepares to make his first public appearance since a number of women came forward this week accusing him of inappropriate touching.

Biden, who is expected to formally announce his candidacy for president after Easter, is scheduled to speak at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

The first woman to accuse Biden of inappropriate behavior was Nevada politician Lucy Flores, who said he came up behind her at a 2014 campaign event and kissed her on the back of the head.

Another accuser told the Washington Post that, when she was a White House intern in 2013, Biden put his head against hers and called her a ""pretty girl."" Another accuser, writer D.J. Hill, said Biden put his hand on her shoulder and dropped it down her back in a way that made her “very uncomfortable” at a 2012 fundraiser.

In a video tweeted Thursday, Biden said, “Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I’ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it.”

1034,Hit-and-run suspect from Argentina appears in Polk County courtroom,"BARTOW, Fla. (WFLA) - A teen girl's morning ride to school came to a horrible end. Her bicycle was tossed to the side of the road.

Mariana Perez Borroto, 13, was hit by a minivan. She died shortly after that.

""She should have been celebrating her 14th birthday in two weeks, but she won't,"" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd.

The Lake Marion Creek Middle Schooler's life was cut short on Homosassa Road in Poinciana Wednesday morning.

""You've been charged with driving without a license causing death of serious bodily injury,"" the judge said Thursday.

Investigators tell News Channel 8 that Micaela Coronel, 25, is to blame.

""Micaela said that there was condensation on her windshield and she did not ever see this child, Mariana, and hit her,"" the sheriff said.

Judd went on to add that Coronel is in the country illegally. He said her work visa expired. Moreover, she doesn't have a driver's license.

""Am I angry? You bet I am. You bet I am,"" Judd said.

Now, the suspect faces years in jail, then deportation by the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.

""This simply wouldn't have happened if she was in her country of origin, country of Argentina,"" Judd said.

1035,These cuddly teddy bears help comfort children involved in wrecks,"CLAY COUNTY, Fla. - Deputies and officers across Northeast Florida are getting unique tools to help with DUI enforcement.

They're called Carlie Bears and on Thursday, Mothers Against Drunk Driving Northeast Florida donated and delivered the stuffed animals to traffic deputies in Clay County. Although the teddy bears look cute and cuddly, they make all the difference when it comes to children involved in wrecks.

""A crash, regardless if it's impairment or not, is traumatizing for a kid,"" said Deputy Travis Pritchard, with the Clay County Sheriff's Office Traffic DUI Enforcement. ""I can't convey how much it calms them down and how much that relieves so much stress on that child to have something they can hold and love.""

Pritchard and Deputy Ryan Riley, also with the Sheriff's Office Traffic DUI Enforcement, together, respond to more than 150 DUI crashes a year. Just Wednesday, Riley said he pulled over an intoxicated mom in Middleburg with three children in the car.

""The kids were terrified. A couple of the kids knew what was going on,"" Riley said.

That's where the bears come in -- to help comfort kids and send a message. The Carlie Bears are named after a 5-year-old girl who died in a drunk driving crash on New Year's Day in 1998 while her mother was behind the wheel.

Many people who drive under the influence don't make it to the back of a patrol car because they either don't get caught or are killed in a crash. Sometimes they take their passengers with them. More than half of kids killed in DUI crashes are riding with impaired drivers.

""Kids really don't have a choice or a voice in who they ride with. When the car door opens, most kids just jump in the car,"" said Judy Cotton, program specialist for MADD Northeast Florida.

MADD is making the bear donations to send a message that they don't want any more victims. In 2017, according to the Florida Highway Patrol, nearly 1,000 people died from DUI crashes in Florida. MADD is urging adults to make arrangements if they plan to drink alcohol and choose not to get behind the wheel under the influence.

OVIEDO, Fla. (WESH) - The employees of a Seminole County restaurant are doing everything they can to reunite a misplaced stuffed animal with its rightful owner.

A mother and daughter came into eat at the Dairy Queen on Hammock Road in Oviedo on Saturday, March 23, but they left the restaurant not realizing the stuffed dog they brought along was still at their table.

They came back looking for it, but employees couldn’t find it at the time.

Employees found the pink-eared pooch while they were cleaning up later that day and after that they started a Facebook campaign to get the dog back to its owner.

“I can't wait to be reunited with my owner. The people at Dairy Queen have been so nice to me, but I just can't wait to be back with my best friend,” one post said.

Monday’s post has the puppy with a new friend. Someone to keep it company until they can find the rightful owner.

“Your little puppy is in good hands and we'll take care of her until you can come and we'll get you some ice cream when you can,” another post said.

MANATEE COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Bradenton man is on trial for a chilling crime that would terrify any parent. Prosecutors say Dominick Hawkins lured a 5-year-old girl with candy and then raped her.

In June 2013, a 5-year-old girl was playing outside her grandmother's home at the Wayside Glen mobile home park in Bradenton.

Prosecutors say Dominick Hawkins, a homeless man, offered to buy her candy.

""They went hand in hand, down the road to a convenience store,” said prosecutor Ashley Dusnik.

The pair was captured on surveillance camera.

“After she got the candy she wanted to go home, but the man told her he was having a party at his house,” said Dusnik.

Instead, he lured her to an abandoned trailer.

""They went to what she thought was his house and she'll tell you that there was no furniture in the house, it just had some trash in the house and that when they got there, the man began to be mean to her. And [he] pushed her down on the ground and began to choke her and told her to shut up and be quiet,” said Dusnik.

Officials say after he assaulted her, he ran to a nearby bus, frantically trying to leave the area.

“She put her pants back on. Tried to exit the trailer, when she found she couldn’t go out the door, she crawled out a window,” said Dusnik.

Surveillance video shows the girl running home for help.

That little girl is now 11-years-old, and she will testify in front of the jury.

Hawkins' defense team says the convenience store owner recognized the pair as regular customers and nothing seemed amiss.

“The video does not depict a man who is holding a 5-year-old against her will, it shows a girl who won't leave Mr. Hawkins alone,” said defense attorney Charalampos Demosthenous.

If convicted, Hawkins will face life in prison.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/bradenton-man-on-trial-for-kidnapping-and-raping-five-year-old-girl-girl-expected-to-testify-today/1894244836,2019-04-02T07:54:54Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

1044,"Crisis response team placed at elementary school after girl, 10, killed by father","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - A crisis response team was placed at Norwood Elementary School in Miami Gardens Monday morning, two days after a man was accused of killing his wife and 10-year-old daughter.

Police said Noel Chambers, 57, killed his young daughter and wife Saturday night at their apartment in the 600 block of Northwest 177th Street before trying to kill his adult daughter.

""Wow. That's unthinkable for a parent to do that to their family,"" Janeka Butler, whose child attends Norwood Elementary School, said.

Parents at the school were shocked to find out about the deadly attack.

Miami Gardens police said Chambers got into an altercation with his wife before attacking his family.

Hearing infuriating and devastating reports of the murder of a 10-year-old child during a domestic dispute. This is so wholly unnatural and inexcusable. I pray for this child’s soul and that peace is found after death, that this innocent child did not experience in life. #Enough — Alberto M. Carvalho (@MiamiSup) March 31, 2019

Police haven't disclosed what the murder weapon was or how the victims died, only saying that the slayings were vicious.

Police said they found Chambers' young daughter dead in a bedroom and his wife dead on the porch. They said his adult daughter was outside the apartment, critically injured.

The surviving victim was taken to the hospital in critical, but stable condition.

Officer Carlos Austin, a spokesman for the Miami Gardens Police Department, said it was the most horrific crime scene that he has seen in his 17 years of law enforcement.

Chambers remains at large.

""Hopefully they catch him,"" Melissa Thomas, whose child attends Norwood Elementary, said. ""Sad for the family, the little girl. Because the child is innocent regardless of the circumstances, whatever is going on between the parents and child is always innocent.""

A crisis response team is at the youngest victim’s school to help students and staff members process their grief.

""I'm glad that they were quick to respond to that because the students are going to need some kind of outlet to kind of express themselves,"" Butler said.

Anyone with information about Chambers' whereabouts is asked to contact Detective H. Schneider at 305-474-1710 or Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS.

1045,Duck gets a leg up on surgery,"OCEAN CITY — Thanks to the nearly two-dozen people who have responded thus far to a GoFundMe campaign, a young duck hobbled by a broken femur will be getting needed surgery.

""I feel awesome!"" said Jamie Wilson, owner of 9-month-old Big Girl, reacting to the donations which have pushed past her $800 goal.

Wilson got Big Girl — and another duck, named Sylvia — from a coworker in January. About a month later, Wilson noticed Big Girl limping. An initial veterinary visit found nothing wrong, but a second trip to another veterinarian indicated Big Girl likely had a hairline fracture of her left femur that became a full-fledged break.

Wilson covered initial veterinary expenses, totaling about $300, but couldn't cover surgery. After learning no local veterinarians or rescue groups would do the surgery on credit, and failing to qualify for veterinary insurance, Wilson turned to GoFundMe.

The campaign began sluggishly, but picked up after a Daily News story on Big Girl's plight. As of late Monday morning, donations totaled more than $900. Most donors gave between $5 and $25, but there were larger donations, including a $275 contribution.

Among the more generous donors, Wilson said, was an elderly homebound gentleman in Santa Rosa Beach who didn't have computer access, but sent his caretaker to Ocean City to find her. Wilson, who by that time had raised the needed $800, spoke with the man by phone, and he urged her to go ahead and take his donation.

""He was like, 'How about food? How about this? How about that?'"" Wilson said.

Wilson has decided to keep the campaign going for a few more days, until she gets Big Girl's surgery scheduled at the Bayside Hospital for Animals in Fort Walton Beach. Wilson was working Monday to get the duck scheduled for the femur repair.

""I won't leave it open that much longer,"" she said Monday.

Meanwhile, on the GoFundMe page, online at gofundme.com/f/surgey-for-big-girl, Wilson wrote, ""... (I)f you would like to make a donation we will use the additional funds for her follow-up appointments, bedding, food ... .""

""I can not express my gratitude for where we are now and we will be greatful (sic) for any additional assistance ... ,"" Wilson added.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190401/duck-gets-leg-up-on-surgery?rssfeed=true,2019-04-01T11:33:50Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
1048,Florida sheriff: Mom killed 11-year-old to keep her from having sex,"An Orange County Sheriff's Office arrest report said Rose Alcides Rivera first denied stabbing the girl but eventually admitted to killing her.

ORLANDO — A woman accused of stabbing her daughter to death told investigators she killed the 11-year-old to keep her from having sex, authorities in Florida said.

Rose Alcides Rivera, 28, pulled up to a hospital in Orlando asking for help for her daughter on Sunday morning, but the girl was already dead from multiple stab wounds, sheriff's investigators said. Then, they say Rivera pulled a knife on hospital workers before being arrested.

She later told investigators she killed her daughter to ""prevent her from having sex"" with men, authorities said. She is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Aleyda Rivera.

The mother told first responders ""my baby is gone,"" the Orlando Sentinel reported. The child had 15 stab wounds to her back and a defensive wound on her right arm.

Orange County Sheriff's investigators said the incident started early Sunday when the mother took her daughter to the home of a man and accused him of having sex with the child. Witnesses told detectives the child denied having sex with anyone.

An arrest report said Rivera first denied stabbing the girl but eventually admitted to killing her. ""Rivera stated she stabbed her daughter while in the car, and while stabbing her she was attempting to make her more comfortable,"" an investigator wrote in the report.

The mother told detectives she believes her daughter is in heaven.

According to the report, Rivera said she didn't see her daughter having sex with the man, nor did the girl tell her she was having sex.

Rivera had a superficial cut on her arm, which authorities believe was self-inflicted.

1050,'Our country is full': Trump says migrants straining immigration system,"Advertisement 'Our country is full': Trump says migrants straining immigration system Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Declaring ""our country is full,"" President Donald Trump on Friday insisted the U.S. immigration system was overburdened and illegal crossings must be stopped as he inspected a refurbished section of fencing at the Mexican border.Trump, making a renewed push for border security as a central campaign issue for his 2020 re-election, participated in a briefing on immigration and border security in Calexico before viewing a 2-mile see-through steel-slat barrier that was a long-planned replacement for an older barrier — and not a new wall.""There is indeed an emergency on our southern border,"" Trump said at the briefing, adding that there has been a sharp uptick in illegal crossings. ""It's a colossal surge and it's overwhelming our immigration system, and we can't let that happen...We can't take you anymore. We can't take you. Our country is full.""As Air Force One touched down in the state, California and 19 other states that are suing Trump over his emergency declaration to build a border wall requested a court order to stop money from being diverted to fund the project. But Trump, who ratcheted up his hardline immigration rhetoric in recent weeks, declared that his move, which included vetoing a congressional vote, was necessary.Also on Friday, House Democrats filed a lawsuit preventing Trump from spending more money than Congress has approved to erect barriers along the southwestern border. Congress approved just under $1.4 billion for work on border barricades. Trump has asserted he can use his powers as chief executive to transfer an additional $6.7 billion to wall construction.Trump, who earlier in the week threatened to shut down the border over the high numbers of migrants trying to enter the U.S., appeared to walk back his comments Thursday. He said Friday that it was because Mexico had gotten tougher in stopping an influx of immigrants from moving north.""Mexico has been absolutely terrific for the last four days,"" the president said as he left the White House. ""I never changed my mind at all. I may shut it down at some point.""The president's visit came a day after he withdrew his nominee to lead U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Longtime border official Ron Vitiello appeared to be cruising toward confirmation, but Trump said Friday that he wanted to go in a ""tougher direction.""Trump, as he so often does, mixed fact with fiction when warning of the threat at the border. When complaining about the Flores legal settlement that governs treatment of migrant children and families, he blamed ""Judge Flores, whoever you may be."" But Flores was an unaccompanied 15-year-old girl from El Salvador.He also downplayed the claims of people seeking asylum at the border, declaring without evidence that many are gang members while comparing some of their efforts to find safety in the U.S. to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 elections.""It's a scam, it's a hoax,"" Trump said. ""I know about hoaxes. I just went through a hoax.""As the president showed off the renovated section of the barrier to reporters, a balloon depicting Trump as a baby floated further down the border. And as Trump landed in California, the state's governor ripped the president's push for Congress to pass legislation that would tighten asylum rules to make it harder for people to qualify.""Since our founding, this country has been a place of refuge — a safe haven for people fleeing tyranny, oppression and violence. His words show a total disregard of the Constitution, our justice system, and what it means to be an American,"" said Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.Trump has been increasingly exasperated at his inability to halt the swelling number of migrants entering the U.S., including thousands who have been released after arriving because border officials have no space for them. Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months, and border agents were on track to make 100,000 arrests or denials of entry in March, a 12-year high. More than half of those are families with children, who require extra care.The southern border is nearly 2,000 miles long and already has about 650 miles of different types of barriers, including short vehicle barricades and tall steel fences that go up to 30 feet high. Most of the fencing was built during George W. Bush's administration, and there have been updates and maintenance throughout other administrations.Trump has yet to complete any new mileage of fencing or other barriers anywhere on the border, though he declared Friday that at least 400 miles of the border barrier would be erected over the next two years. His administration so far has only replaced existing fencing. Construction for that small chunk of fencing cost about $18 million, began in February 2018 and was completed in October.

1051,Munchausen syndrome by proxy: What is the mental health problem used in Gypsy Rose case?,"Gypsy Rose Blanchard was forced by her mother to undergo unnecessary medical procedures and was later convicted in connection with her murder. (Photo: HBO)

Gypsy Rose Blanchard, a woman previously known by her community as a sick child with cancer, pleaded guilty to murdering her mother — a woman she says forced her to fake disabilities, like someone suffering from Munchausen syndrome by proxy may do.

Dee Dee Blanchard convinced her daughter she had leukemia, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, asthma and poor vision. But, Gypsy was actually a healthy girl subject to multiple surgeries, medications and a wheelchair.

In 2015, Gypsy Rose Blanchard and a boyfriend she met online were charged with first-degree murder after Dee Dee Blanchard was found stabbed to death in her bed.

The shocking case is also the subject of Hulu's new drama, ""The Act."" HBO's documentary film ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" focused on details of the case in 2017.

Here's what you should know about Munchausen syndrome by proxy:

What is Munchausen syndrome by proxy?

It's a mental disorder, also known as factitious disorder, that involves a parent exaggerating, inducing or making up illnesses for a child that is not actually sick. People may do this to gain sympathy, attention and money. It is a form of child abuse.

Marc Feldman, who has been studying Munchausen by proxy for over 25 years, said in a past interview that Munchausen by proxy survivors can struggle with discerning what's real and what's not, and they sometimes avoid getting medical care when they need it because they don't trust hospitals.

""Adult survivors of Munchausen by proxy, they almost invariably have post-traumatic stress disorder,"" Feldman said. ""If not the full-blown disorder, at least symptoms like flashbacks.""

Do experts think Gypsy Blanchard's mom had it?

Feldman feels confident saying Gypsy Blanchard was a victim of Munchausen by proxy.

""Gypsy was infantilized and kept away from her peers,"" Feldman said. ""She was little more than a tool for Dee Dee to navigate through the world the way she wanted to.""

Feldman noted the length of time that Dee Dee Blanchard abused her daughter and her ability to dupe so many people.

""The length to which Dee Dee took it is remarkable,"" Feldman said. ""Part of the agenda appears to be malingering, trying to get money out of the fraud ... But most of it seemed to be her pursuit of attention and control.""

Where is Gypsy now?

Gypsy Blanchard is serving a 10-year sentence for her role in the death of her mother. In a 2018 interview, her stepmother Kristy Blanchard said she's doing ""amazing"" working toward earning her GED.

""There has been no long-term side effects from all the medication her mom had given her,"" Blanchard said at the time. ""She has a clean bill of health, thank God — and I really only think what it has done was stunt her growth.""

1053,Man accused of slaughtering 400-pound pet pig named Princess that wandered into yard,"Advertisement Man accused of slaughtering 400-pound pet pig named Princess that wandered into yard Share Shares Copy Link Copy

A pet pig named Princess wandered away from her California home last month and met an ugly demise.""It's just a really bizarre case,"" said Arcata police Lt. Todd Dockweiler.Princess wasn't one of those teacup pigs that you can carry around like a Chihuahua. She was a big girl, nearly 400 pounds, according to the Lost Coast Outpost.The fact that she wandered away wasn't out of the ordinary at all.""Believe it or not, that's not a super uncommon call for us. We have a lot of loose livestock calls,"" said Dockweiler. ""It is very common to have loose cows, loose horses, loose goats. it's still a neighborhood environment, but a lot of folks have a few acres.""An officer responded and found Princess hanging out in someone's yard. The officer asked the property owner if he wouldn't mind keeping the pig in his yard until they could track down its owner, a practice Dockweiler says is common for these kinds of loose livestock issues.The neighbor happily obliged, and the officer went off to track down Princess's owner. Her owner was already looking for her, too, so she was easy to identify. But when the officer went back to retrieve Princess from the yard about an hour later, he stumbled upon something shocking: a butchering in progress.""Obviously that was a bit of a shock to everyone involved. ... Given the stage of the butchering process he was in, he must have slaughtered the pig very shortly after the officer left,"" Dockweiler said.The man police say is responsible wasn't the homeowner but ""a man who was known to them"" who was on the property with the owner's permission.Thankfully, Princess's owner, identified as Carrie Hogan by the Lost Coast Outpost, wasn't there to see the gruesome scene for herself. But when she heard the news, she was devastated. Hogan told the local news site she bottle-fed Princess since she was a piglet and considered the pet a part of her family. According to Arcata police, slaughtering a pig that doesn't belong to you is a crime. Officers are expecting to forward a criminal charge to the district attorney's office after their investigation is complete.""It's just not clear what the thought process was. He obviously knew the pig didn't belong to him and he didn't have the right to slaughter it.""While Hogan considered Princess a family member, under the law, she's still considered livestock, so Dockweiler expects the suspect to be charged with ""theft of livestock.""Hogan told the Lost Coast Outpost she thinks the man responsible still has her pet's meat. She wants to get it back to keep him — or anyone else — from eating it.""I think that the hardest part of this is knowing that there's somebody out there that's this kind of a savage,"" Hogan said.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/man-accused-of-slaughtering-400-pound-pet-pig-named-princess-that-wandered-into-yard/27048443,2019-04-04T23:25:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
1054,Mother of murdered 7-year-old sponsors scholarship to prevent future child victims,"0 Mother of murdered 7-year-old sponsors scholarship to prevent future child victims

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The mother of a murdered local 7-year-old is sponsoring a scholarship so that no other child is victimized.

Friday would be Somer Thompson’s 17th birthday.

October will mark 10 years since she was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered by a sexual predator who struck while she was walking to school.

TRENDING:

Diena Thompson, Somer's mother, said the new scholarship aims to give people the tools they need to identify and report these crimes.

“It’s to protect our children. It’s to protect our community,” Thompson said. “Our children are our most precious commodity and if we don’t start protecting them and trying to help them see the good and the evil in this world than I’m afraid the future could be disastrous for us.”

Somer Thompson was abducted and murdered by Jarred Harrell, who is serving a life sentence.

“Unfortunately, I have to miss my little girl because a monster came into my world and took her away,” Diena Thompson said.

The Somer Sunshine Scholarship is offering Darkness to Light Stewards of Children online training to anyone living in Baker, Clay, Duval, Nassau or St. Johns counties.

The training helps people learn how to prevent, recognize and react appropriately to sexual abuse.

Children’s Safe Passage, founded in response to Somer’s death, and the Somer Sunshine Foundation are providing it.

“I could possibly make a difference for somebody else and that’s what I’m going to do,” Diena Thompson said.

Thompson said if the scholarship can save even one child, it’s all worth it.

For people outside of Northeast Florida, they can access the training for $10.

1056,Kissimmee teen dies after car strikes her bicycle,"A minivan driven by a woman in the country on a ""visitor pass"" from Argentina and with no valid driver license struck and killed 13-year-old Mariana Perez Borroto on her way to school.

KISSIMMEE — Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies arrested 25-year-old Micaela Coronel of Kissimmee on charges of operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver license causing death, a third-degree felony, after she fatally struck 13-year-old Mariana Perez Borroto on Tuesday morning.

Coronel ""failed to use care"" when driving, hitting Borroto with her vehicle, according to PCSO reports.

According to the arrest affidavit, the crash occurred around 7:50 a.m.

Borroto, an 8th grader at Lake Marion Creek Middle School in Kissimmee/Poinciana, was riding her bicycle to school when she was hit by the Chrysler Town & Country minivan headed eastbound on Homosassa Road.

The teen was critically injured and airlifted to Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital in Orlando, where she later succumbed to her injuries, said the Sheriff's Office in a prepared media release Wednesday.

Coronel told deputies she's been in the country on a ""visitor pass"" from Argentina since October, and presented them with an Argentinian identification card, according to reports. She does not have a Florida driver license, and deputies determined through their investigation that she does not have a valid driver license at all.

Coronel told deputies that at the time of the crash, condensation covered approximately 80% of her windshield, obstructing her view while she was driving, according to reports.

Other factors that may have contributed to the crash are being investigated, said the Sheriff's Office. The investigation is ongoing.

The PCSO is checking with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to determine her status in the country, due to the fact that she's committed a felony, according to reports.

""This suspect should not have even been behind the wheel of a vehicle. This is an awful, senseless tragedy that should never have occurred,"" Sheriff Grady Judd said. ""This beautiful child should be turning 14 years old in just two weeks, but for this suspect's illegal actions. Mariana's family and friends are in our prayers.""

Johna Jozwiak, the principal at Lake Marion Creek Middle, said, ""Our hearts are broken today. We are devastated by the loss of a very special member of our Lake Marion Creek Middle family. Mariana was a bright and sweet-natured girl who possessed a very polite and calm manner. She enjoyed studying history and loved spending her free time sketching in notebooks. We are devastated by this tragic news.""

Counselors are available at school for students and staff members, said Jozwiak. The rest of this week's Florida Standards Assessments testing has been rescheduled to next week, she said.

Two teenagers trying to rescue a dog from a canal died Monday when they grabbed hold of an electrically charged metal bridge, the Solano County Sheriff’s Office said.Three teenage boys, a teenage girl and a dog were walking alongside a Solano Irrigation District canal west of Interstate 80 in Dixon around 12:30 p.m. when, at some point, two of the teens and the dog walked across the bridge, which goes over the canal. “For unknown reasons, the dog jumped or fell from the bridge into the SID canal,” a news release from the sheriff’s office said. Two of the boys — identified by officials as 17-year-old Jacob Hourmouzus of Elk Grove and 17-year-old Jacob Schneider of Dixon — jumped into the canal to try to save the dog. As they grabbed the dog, the teens reached up to the metal bridge to try to keep from being pulled farther down the canal. “When doing so, witness reports state the two teenage boys appeared to have been electrocuted and unable to release their grip from the metal bridge,” the sheriff’s office said. The third teenage boy saw what was happening and jumped into the canal, which knocked the two other teens off the bridge. He was able to pull the two teens from the canal and onto the side of the levee. The teenage girl then called 911. Firefighters quickly arrived at the canal and started lifesaving efforts on the two boys. Both were rushed to a hospital in Vacaville, where they were pronounced dead. A Pacific Gas and Electric Co. crew went to the scene to deactivate power to the energized bridge so that it would be safe for investigators. Investigators with the sheriff’s office and the Solano County District Attorney’s Office are looking into the case and “will work with experts to determine how the bridge became energized and this incident occurred,” the release said. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of everyone affected by this tragedy,” Solano County Sheriff Thomas Ferrara said in a statement. “The Solano County Sheriff’s Office will continue to search for answers as to how this incident happened.”The dog, named Ranger, was treated for its injuries, released to its family and was reportedly in good health as of Tuesday morning, officials said.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/teens-killed-trying-to-save-dog-solano-county/27024689,2019-04-03T04:16:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Video

MANATEE COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Bradenton man is on trial for a chilling crime that would terrify any parent.

Prosecutors say Dominick Hawkins lured a 5-year-old girl with candy and then raped her.

In June 2013, a 5-year-old girl was playing outside her grandmother's home at the Wayside Glen mobile home park in Bradenton.

Prosecutors say Dominick Hawkins, a homeless man, offered to buy her candy.

""They went hand in hand, down the road to a convenience store,” said prosecutor Ashley Dusnik.

The pair was captured on surveillance camera.

“After she got the candy she wanted to go home, but the man told her he was having a party at his house,” said Dusnik.

Instead, he lured her to an abandoned trailer.

""They went to what she thought was his house and she'll tell you that there was no furniture in the house, it just had some trash in the house and that when they got there, the man began to be mean to her. And [he] pushed her down on the ground and began to choke her and told her to shut up and be quiet,” said Dusnik.

Officials say after he assaulted her, he ran to a nearby bus, frantically trying to leave the area.

“She put her pants back on. Tried to exit the trailer, when she found she couldn’t go out the door, she crawled out a window,” said Dusnik.

Surveillance video shows the girl running home for help.

That little girl is now 11-years-old, and she will testify in front of the jury.

Hawkins' defense team says the convenience store owner recognized the pair as regular customers and nothing seemed amiss.

“The video does not depict a man who is holding a 5-year-old against her will, it shows a girl who won't leave Mr. Hawkins alone,” said defense attorney Charalampos Demosthenous.

If convicted, Hawkins will face life in prison.

1065,"Benches, sidewalks, safety top concerns for local leaders after death of Cape Coral girl","CLOSE Layla's family and friends hosted their own fundraiser called Lights for Layla. Andrea Melendez, Fort Myers News-Press

Local leaders discussed school bus stop safety Monday, following the death of an 8-year-old girl who was hit by a truck while waiting for the bus last week.

At the Cape Coral City Council meeting, a member of the Rotary Club of Cape Coral said the organization plans on working with other organizations and donors to install more benches at school bus stops in the city. Ed Bolter, a Rotarian and vice president of Lamar Advertising, said the club has the capability and resources to help make this project happen.

“I don't want to see another child hurt, much less tragically killed; it's too emotional for the whole city,"" Bolter said. ""We need to get this done. So hopefully we can do it.”

Layla Aiken was killed last week when a pickup struck her while she was waiting at a school bus stop with her twin brothers. Police recovered a truck they believe is involved and identified a person of interest, but have yet to make an arrest.

Bolter said he has discussed the project with a Fort Myers company that will donate precast slabs on which the benches will go, which would allow the benches to be more easily moved.

Cape Coral Traffic Engineer Bill Corbett said there have been 16,000 school bus stop changes countywide during the current school year, for various reasons, including the presence of registered sex offenders and students moving. He said there are roughly 7,000 school bus stops in Lee County with 1,671, or about 24%, located in Cape Coral.

He said 673 of Cape Coral's stops are semipermanent, meaning they remain the same year-after-year. To date, all semipermanent bus stops with pickups or drop-offs during dark hours have street lights, he said.

Consultant and former mayor Joe Mazurkiewicz said the city manager included him in the discussions because of his experience helping to deploy LeeTran benches. He said the Chamber of Commerce, Cape Coral Construction Industry Association and other organizations have reached out with their willingness to join in the effort.

District 5 Council Member David Stokes pledged to sponsor a bench.

“With this many folks supporting … we can take a big bite out of this fairly quickly,” Mazurkiewicz said.

District 7 Council Member Jessica Cosden requested that the city have a dedicated sidewalks budget that includes money from the general fund this budget season or sooner. She said the sidewalks budget now is all grant-funded.

""We're too big of a city not to do that,” Cosden said.

Several meeting attendees — many of whom wore ""#LightsForLayla"" T-shirts, and some of whom were students themselves — urged City Council members to take action with emotional pleas.

Randi Romanov, a friend of Lalya's mother and one of the Lights for Layla organizers, said everyone was at fault for allowing the girl's death to happen.

“How many more of our children need to die before this community does something? I’m going to answer that for you; the answer is none.”

Mayor Joe Coviello said he was sure the city could find safety solutions without ""economics"" getting in the way.

""We'll find funding for this kind of a program,"" Coviello said. ""As the (city gets) built out, things like sidewalks more street lighting, go hand-in-hand.""

The Lee County School Board and local law enforcement leaders held a meeting earlier in the day to talk about school safety issues, including school bus stop safety.

Superintendent Greg Adkins said the school district and the city of Cape Coral plan to form a team to look at the issue. Adkins said he also wants to have similar discussions with Lehigh, the city of Fort Myers and the county.

""I think countywide we have to work within our different cities and municipalities to try to address this issue more broadly,"" Adkins said. ""That's when you talk about ... sidewalks or safer bus stop areas. This is something I think is going to be a collaborative effort moving forward.

""And let's face it ... there are reports out there that have shown that Lee County is one of the more dangerous communities in our country as it relates to pedestrian and bicycle safety,"" Adkins said. ""That impact students walking to school and riding to school on their bicycles.""

Just weeks after she was deemed not competent for trial and sent to a state psychiatric hospital, a Pensacola woman has recovered enough to stand trial for her alleged role in the murder of her 9-year-old adopted daughter.

Grace Joan Smith, 71, is one of three people charged in the 2017 death of Dericka Lindsay, a child who suffocated when her cousin sat on her as a form of discipline. Both of Smith's co-defendants have already been convicted and sentenced to state prison, but Smith's trial was delayed when doctors determined she suffered delirium that prevented her from understanding court proceedings.

Smith was committed to the Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee, where she received several weeks of competency training from medial staff. In a follow-up hearing Monday morning in Pensacola, a judge ruled Smith has regained her competency and the trial can move forward.

Competency, for court purposes, describes a defendant's ability to follow court proceedings, understand their rights and assist their attorney.

Smith was in poor physical health when she was initially arrested, and according to doctors, her mental health began to degrade as she was in jail awaiting trial. In a Feb. 21 competency hearing, officials said Smith suffered delirium, lost 200 pounds, spent most of her time in bed, frequently declined meals and medication, and refused to let nurses turn her to alleviate bed sores.

At the February hearing, Judge Jan Shackelford deemed Smith not competent and approved her transfer to Chattahoochee. Part of the judge's stated reasoning was that state medical personnel had the ability to compel Smith to comply with her treatment.

Smith has shown marked improvement under state care, according to officials, with Shackleford noting in the follow-up hearing Monday that Smith had been more ""participatory and interactive"" at the hospital than she was at court.

After finding Smith competent, the judge set a tentative trial date for mid-May.

Prosecutors claim Smith and her husband, James, were having trouble maintaining discipline over Dericka. On the day of Dericka's death, her cousin, Veronica Green Posey, came over to help the Smiths get the 9-year-old under control. The approximately 320-pound Posey ended up killing Dericka when she sat on the girl's torso for several minutes.

Posey was convicted of felony murder and sentenced to life in prison. James Smith pleaded no contest to aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to a decade in prison.

1068,Man caught in shower with young girl,"A man is facing lewd and lascivious charges after getting caught in the shower with a young girl. According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, the girl's mother made the shocking discovery.

Deputies arrested 20-year-old Pablo Perez Lopez on three counts of lewd and lascivious battery and one count of lewd and lascivious molestation on a victim older than 12 but younger than 16.

The girl told investigators she and Perez Lopez began getting close and that she started to fall in love with him. She said she initiated the idea of the two having sex in the shower. While standing nude in the shower, the girl said her mother opened the bathroom door and found Perez Lopez pulling his pants up. The girl later admitted to investigators she and Perez Lopez had sex approximately three times starting in February.

Perez Lopez is due in court Monday morning.

1069,Aunt of girl severely injured from abuse shares dangers,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - It's easy to think child abuse happens to some other family in some other neighborhood. In reality, it happens multiple times every day.

Florida's child abuse hotline averages 77 calls from Northeast Florida each day. Those calls are about children neglected, beaten or worse.

A woman whose 2-year-old niece, Rosie, suffered such head trauma she was paralyzed shared her family's painful story of abuse with the hope it will prevent another child from suffering the same fate.

""At some point, someone took their hands and smashed in her ears on both sides of her head,"" said Rosie's aunt, Mandy Rhoden. ""I didn't think she was going to make it.""

Rhoden was speechless when she saw her niece for the first time in the hospital. The 2-year-old had suffered such severe trauma she had a stroke.

""She was paralyzed on the left side,"" Rhoden was speechless when she saw her niece for the first time in the hospital. The 2-year-old had suffered such severe trauma she had a stroke.

Video of Rosie in the hospital shows her whole body quivering from a seizure from the brain damage. The white of her left eye was blood-red.

A diagram showed all of the bruises on her little body.

""There were so many bruises on her body, they couldn't even count them all,"" Rhoden said.

Rhoden had been trying for months to get her sister -- Rosie's mom -- to give her custody of the girl. Instead, the mom turned the child over to a friend.

""He said she fell out of her car seat and she hit her head on the ground, and that's what caused her stroke,"" Rhoden said.

Jeremy Leonard is now charged with child abuse. The officers who arrested him reported finding a hole in a wall of his home about 3 feet from the ground. That's about the height of Rosie.

After the injury, it took weeks for Rosie to move her left hand and months more for her to learn how to walk again.

Now 4, Rosie is in a much happier, safer place, but she still has to wear a brace around her ankle to walk.

Rhoden has adopted her, along with another niece who was born with fetal alcohol syndrome.

She understands that raising children is hard.

""It is not easy for me. I am a single parent. I have a full-time job. I have two children and Rosie has all these therapies and doctors' appointments. Do I get frustrated? Yes. But never with them.""

She hopes that sharing Rosie's story will remind anyone who cares for a child to stop before doing something that will change your life and a child's life forever.

""Don't let your last resort be abusing a child that has not done anything to deserve the abuse you are dishing out to him,"" Rhoden said. ""You need to step away, take a few minutes to gather yourself and remember what you are there for. You're there to be their parent.""

Doctors at Wolfson Children's Hospital have become concerned about the number of child abuse cases they've treated recently, especially among babies.

Experts suggest putting yourself in time out before you get so angry or so frustrated that you lash out at a child.

If you suspect abuse or neglect, you are urged to report the situation online at reportabuse.dcf.state.fl.us or call 1-800-962-2873.

1070,Melbourne nurse celebrating wedding anniversary saves child from near-drowning,"CLOSE Keith Cunningham, with the American Red Cross, demonstrates proper method of CPR.

It's a scene no one wants to see.

A little girl is pulled from a pool — blue in color and unresponsive.

Sadly, that was what happened recently at the Rosen Shingle Creek hotel in Orlando.

Fortunately, Laura Dalton, a registered nurse at Health First’s Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne, was there celebrating her 13th wedding anniversary.

“I see this lady holding this little girl, and she’s just blue,” Dalton said. “Your skills just take over.”

She described the next several minutes as an “out-of-body experience,” as her instinct kicked in and she began performing chest compressions on the small child, whom she estimated to be about 4 years old.

Dalton thinks she did about 10 rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, before the preschool-age child began coughing up water and hacking.

“By the time paramedics arrived, she was crying and wanted her mom and dad,” Dalton said.

The child was rushed to a nearby children’s hospital in Orlando where officials said she recovered.

With Florida leading the nation in the number of drowning deaths of children ages 1 to 4, CPR is something that could potentially help everyone, even if it is one of those things we hope we’ll never have to use.

Dalton does think about the fact that had no one else been present who was trained in CPR, the outcome could have been tragic.

Dalton being there must have been fate.

The weekend getaway was a surprise anniversary treat from her mother-in-law just days earlier, Dalton said. With her husband in the military and expected to deploy in May, the trip became an incredible gift not just for the couple, their two children and extended family, but also for this tiny guest and her loved ones.

“I’m so grateful that I happened to be right by this little girl when she needed help,” Dalton said. “It just goes to show how important a skill CPR is — and it’s something anyone can learn and use to save a life.”

Residents say that this is not the first time a car has crashed into their building. Courtney Passalacqua said that ""apparently the people who lived here prior to us moved out because the same situation happened.

1075,Volusia schools look to cut down on high rate of suspensions,"A third-grade student walked into Christopher Sherriff’s classroom at Palm Terrace Elementary and threw herself into a chair. She was distraught, slumped down so far she was in danger of spilling onto the floor. She held her face in her hands and began to cry.

Sherriff folded himself into an identical tiny plastic chair beside her and slowly extracted the problem: After not doing well on a recent test, she was angry at her “stupid” teacher.

At many schools, a child leaving a classroom without permission and calling her teacher stupid would mean a one-way ticket to the principal’s office and, possibly, a suspension.

But as the Volusia County school district pushes to improve its state grade to an A, its track record of disciplining students stands out — and not in a good way. Over the last school year, 91 of every 1,000 students in Volusia were suspended. That's 78 percent higher than the state average of 51 students in every 1,000. No large, A-rated district in Florida had a higher rate of out-of-school suspensions or chronic absenteeism than Volusia. Flagler County had a rate of 68 suspended students per 1,000.

So Sherriff's focus wasn't on discipline; he sought to help the girl identify what she was feeling and how to deal with it constructively.

He calmly explained once, then again in a different way, that she was feeling more disappointed in herself than angry at her teacher. Her teacher wasn’t out to get her. The best way to deal with those feelings would be to work hard and improve on the next test.

Eventually, she perked up. She sat by herself and shuffled her feet while she considered his point. Then she went back to class with a plan to talk to her teacher one-on-one about what happened.

This is what a win looks like in Volusia County schools, where last year only 10 of Florida’s 67 school districts had a higher rate of out-of-school suspensions. That means more kids piling up absences instead of prepping for the exams the state uses to measure student performance and grade the school district’s effectiveness.

Now, Volusia is prioritizing social and emotional learning. Sherriff is an example of the teachers on assignment in middle and select elementary schools who were hired to impart lessons that go beyond reading and math to help children identify and respond to emotions that can cause problems if they don’t have them under control.

“It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand the more kids are out of school, the less likely they are to make academic progress,” said Cindy Fisher, who helps oversee discipline for Volusia schools and summed up what nearly everyone The News-Journal interviewed for this story said.

FAITH — an outside group of religious organizations in Volusia devoted to social justice — called on the School Board to reduce the amount of out-of-school suspensions by 50 percent by 2021. The group believes that a culture change encouraged by district leadership is what's needed. It’s hosting an action assembly at 6:30 p.m. Monday in Daytona’s Peabody Auditorium to further discuss the issue.

For about a year Volusia has made a coordinated push to cut down on the number of suspensions and keep kids in class. By offering more preventative measures, like social-emotional learning and restorative discipline practices, and generally turning to suspensions as a last resort, district officials hope the numbers will trend down this year.

“We do recognize that number (of suspensions) was high,” said Superintendent Tom Russell, who added it’s a question of school culture. “Is our culture going to be doing our very best to keep students in class? Or do you have just a very, very strict discipline code? You’re desperately trying to find the medium.”

The problem

On days she’s suspended, 7-year-old Kassie Larsh watches TV. She plays with her dogs, Chloe and Slater. She runs errands with her grandma and her cousin.

What’s meant to be a punishment feels more like a vacation for the second-grader at Forest Lake Elementary in Deltona, who giggles when she explains her routine on those days.

“To her, it has no bearing,” said her mom, Krissy, echoing the parents of other young students who have been punished in this way. “She doesn’t even understand why she’s being suspended, and she thinks it’s great.”

Because student records are confidential, school officials are unable to comment about Kassie's suspensions. Her mom said she's been suspended from school for seven days so far this year, a punishment that also results in the loss of privileges at home like watching TV and using a tablet. Each suspension occurred because Kassie, who has a behavioral disability, hit another student. At many schools, violence is one of the non-negotiables that can lead to a suspension.

“She’s getting the suspensions, and then she’s getting the letters for chronic absenteeism,” she said.

These are the documents schools send home with students who are in danger of being labeled chronically absent, or missing 10 percent of the entire school year. “We are concerned that these absences may affect Kassandra’s educational progress toward graduation,” the letters read.

Kassie’s experience illustrates part of Volusia’s problem: How can you discipline students to curb bad behavior without compromising their academic progress or anyone’s safety?

Volusia has erred on the side of safety, turning out students from the classroom at a higher rate than other large counties like Miami-Dade, Hillsborough and Orange. The number of Volusia students suspended in 2017-2018 totaled about 5,700, just under 10 percent of the student population. The number of total out-of-school suspensions — which counts each time a student is suspended — was just under 11,000. (That's a figure the state doesn't track, so it's difficult to make comparisons with other districts.)

Another problem with school discipline that's been widely documented across the country is that it disproportionately affects black students. Volusia is no different. Although black students make up less than one-fifth of Volusia's student population, they account for about one-third of suspensions. White students are two-thirds of the population, but constitute less than half of suspensions.

Nicholas Gage, an assistant professor at the University of Florida and an expert on positive behavioral interventions for children, explained there is a national movement to reduce the number of out-of-school suspensions in districts.

“There is an ever-growing and mounting evidence base suggesting that suspensions have really negative outcomes on students, particularly out-of-school suspensions,” Gage said. “Removing students from a classroom reduces their access to general curriculum, and they are less likely to be successful.”

Earlier this year, a News-Journal analysis of state data showed Volusia lags behind Florida’s seven A-rated large districts in areas that impact student performance: It has lower teacher pay and experience, gets less of the state funding allocation, has a lower median household income, and has a higher rate of students living in poverty.

Compared with those same seven school districts, Volusia also had the highest number of out-of-school suspensions last year and the highest rate of chronic absenteeism.

Although middle schools had the most out-of-school suspensions, the chronic absenteeism rate at the elementary level rivaled that of the middle schools. Last year, the majority of Volusia's elementary schools were C-rated by the state.

“It’s hard for me to wrap by brain around how we send kids in elementary school home,” Gage said. “The direct instruction that early elementary kids get is their primary form of instruction.”

Volusia officials know this, and they're pushing to improve, especially at the elementary level. Teachers are expecting to get new math and language arts textbooks by the beginning of next year after five years without the basic materials. The district is also adding 30 minutes onto the elementary school day, to give those students even more access to instructional time.

Even as that’s all happening, Volusia has been changing the way it handles discipline and, in effect, its priorities — nearly unnoticed by anyone who isn’t experiencing it every day.

The response

A class of eighth-graders at Hinson Middle School recently sat in a circle and took turns answering questions posed by their teacher. What was your favorite family vacation? What are two of your pet peeves? What’s the last book you read?

Sometimes the entire class burst into laughter at someone’s sarcastic answer and they chattered over each other. Other times the honesty and vulnerability of the answers left everyone quiet for a couple of seconds.

Asked what they would change if they could go back in time, one student spoke about wanting to repair his relationship with his father before his death. Immediately afterward, another student said she wished she hadn’t spilled bleach on her carpet.

The exercise for middle schoolers, who traditionally have the highest rate of suspensions, was designed to teach them the classroom is a safe place, they’re all on the same team and that listening is often more important than having something to say.

It’s another example of the social and emotional learning taking place in Volusia. Seven teachers on assignment cover all 14 of Volusia’s middle schools, and four elementary schools have a full-time teacher in place to gradually teach kids how to better control their emotions.

“We teach them how to do math, we teach them how to read, but we don’t teach them how to get along with other people or how to resolve a conflict in an appropriate way,” Sherriff said. “And those are arguably more important than (for example) learning science. Because not everyone is going to use science when they’re an adult, but everyone is going to have conflict when they’re an adult.”

The teachers on assignment like Sherriff work with small groups of students, as well as helping other teachers incorporate social and emotional learning practices in the classroom. Some schools ask elementary students to chart their emotions on grids on their desks so teachers can gauge their needs. Others seek to build relationships among students so the class feels like a team.

It’s all in an effort to introduce once more a holistic approach to a child’s education. After years of being laser-focused on academic rigor and curriculum instruction — when every minute of the school day is planned and designed to give students more instruction and access to curriculum — social and emotional learning is, at its core, about instructors slowing down and getting to know the students they’re teaching.

“The teachers, the ones who it’s really clicked with, are seeing they can’t just come in and be a giver of curriculum, more or less,” said Greg Iorio, the dean of student relationships at Hinson Middle.

The results

After one year of implementing these practices, preliminary results suggest its working. At Palm Terrace where Sherriff works, for example, the elementary had seen 82 out-of-school suspensions through February for this school year. For the same period in the previous school year, Palm Terrace had 224 suspensions.

At the middle school level, which had 300 out-of-school suspensions for each 1,000 students in the past three years, there's been a 17 percent drop in discipline referrals compared with this time last year.

Russell promised at a March School Board meeting to present the latest district data soon. But no matter what the numbers show, there’s more in the pipeline for Volusia.

For now, there aren't any concrete plans to put more SEL teachers on assignments at more schools, said SEL specialist Justin Lipomi in an email.

The reviews from stakeholders are good, however, and he said his office will be advocating at a meeting later this month for the district to use federal funding to expand the program.

""Expansion is a top priority for us,"" Lipomi said.

In an effort to come up with more innovative ways to lower the number of suspensions, the district also started a task force in December called “Rethinking Discipline.” The group of mostly administrators will continue to meet to think of better ways to deal with students who act out.

“The bottom line is we want as many kids in school as possible,” Russell said. “We have worked to put in programs and create positions to help to that end, and we’re going to continue … (to create) a classroom culture where learning is encouraged and takes place every day.

“To me, that’s what you want.”",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190406/volusia-schools-look-to-cut-down-on-high-rate-of-suspensions?rssfeed=true,2019-04-06T20:13:24Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
1077,"Police now say 1 died at scene of overnight Cove shooting, 3 injured; shooter still on the loose","Panama City Police have identified absconded sex offender Michael Harrison Hunt as a person of interest, according to public information officer Caitlin Lawrence. Police have been looking for Hunt this week, as he has an active warrant for failure to appear April 1 on charges of ""Unlawful sexual activity with certain minors"" and aggravated assault, according to court records. According to an arrest complaint Hunt was already a registered sex offender.

PANAMA CITY —One of the people involved Thursday night in a Cove shooting actually died at the scene on Allen Avenue Thursday night, Panama City police are now saying, while three more remain hospitalized with life-threatening injuries.

The names of the victims have not been released, but police are searching for absconded sex offender Michael Harrison Hunt as a person of interest, according to public information officer Caitlin Lawrence. The truck he was believed to have been driving has been found abandoned in Bay County, Lawrence said.

Police have been looking for Hunt since Monday when he was deemed as a failure to appear on charges of ""Unlawful sexual activity with certain minors"" and aggravated assault, according to court records. According to an arrest complaint Hunt was already a registered sex offender.

Thursday shooting happened at about 10:30 p.m. in the 100 block of Allen Avenue, near the corner with Cherry Street. Two homes there were marked by crime scene tape Friday and it was unknown if the victims were associated with both homes.

According to a press release received at 12:21 p.m. today, ""one victim succumbed to their injuries at the scene. The other three victims were transported to a local hospital for treatment. They all remain in serious condition at this time.""

The department is saying that this is ""not a random act"" and they do not believe there is an immediate threat of danger to people living in the Cove or the rest of the city.

Hunt is described as a black male, 5'09'' tall and around 210 pounds. Hunt is known to operate a black 2015 Ford Explorer with Florida tag ETCT72 and his last known registered address in the 2100 block of E. 5th Street.

People with information on his location are asked to call the police.

Information from police has been slow in coming; one nearby school that heard about it on the Internet sent this message, which some parents who shared it with The News Herald: ""Due to a shooting in the Cove neighborhood, school time this morning is postponed. Parents are asked to keep children at home until the suspect is captured. There is a lockdown location for all students at school today.”

One man who drove by the scene but asked that his name not be used said he was particularly concerned and trying to get information because he had heard the suspect was also wanted for child sex charge, but he didn't know if that was true.

Police have now said it is, and according to courthouse records Hunt was arrested Sept. 12 by the Bay County Sheriff's Office and charged with ""Unlawful Sexual Activity with Certain Minors.""

That investigation, according to court records, began with a Sept. 11 call to Panama City police involving Hunt ""displaying a firearm during a verbal altercation."" According to an arrest complaint, a man confronted Hunt ""about having sexual contact with a neighbor's daughter."" The complaint said Hunt went to his vehicle and lifted his shirt, ""exposing a handgun he had tucked into the right side of his waist band.""

Hunt allegedly told the man, ""This can be taken care of right now,"" according to the complaint.

As police investigated that incident, it led to the discovery that Hunt was involved in sex acts with a minor that occurred outside the city, which started an investigation by the Bay County Sheriff's Office.

A Bay County Sheriff's Office arrest complaint said the girl in that case told them she had sex with Hunt. Hunt, in an interview, admitted to knowing the victim, denied having sex with her and admitted to knowing she was underage.

After his arrest on those charges in September, Hunt made bond but failed to appear in court April 1.

1083,"CCSO: Collier man arrested, accused of using social media to extort lewd photos from minors","CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

A Collier County man was arrested Wednesday and accused of hacking into Snapchat accounts and extorting lewd photos from eight teens, according to the Collier County Sheriff’s Office.

Jorge L. Ingunza Jr., 21, was charged with possession of child pornography, two counts of transmitting child pornography, four counts of extortion and six counts of accessing a computer or electronic device without authorization.

The eight victims, including six in Collier County and two in Colorado, range in age from 13 to 18, according to the sheriff’s office.

Detectives said evidence indicates there are numerous other unidentified victims, according to a news release from CCSO.

Some of these victims may not want to come forward out of fear they will be in trouble for having lewd photos of themselves, however the victims will not face charges and law enforcement wants to help them, according to CCSO.

The victims in Colorado told authorities they are aware of more than 20 other victims who are all afraid of repercussions for coming forward, according to Ingunza’s arrest report.

Since mid-December 2018, CCSO has received tips from local victims, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement in Colorado about someone hacking into minors' Snapchat accounts, according to CCSO.

Snapchat is a popular messaging app that allows users to share photos and videos that disappear in a few seconds. Users can also post content that will stay visible for 24 hours.

Ingunza accessed the victim’s Snapchat accounts by tricking them into providing their usernames and passwords or by using an already-compromised account belonging to a friend of the victim, according to the sheriff’s office.

Ingunza then took over the victim’s accounts, changing their backup e-mails, phone numbers and passwords, according to CCSO.

He downloaded the lewd images and videos and then sent them back to the victim on Instagram, according to CCSO.

Detectives said Ingunza threatened to post the images publicly on social media if the victims didn’t send him more lewd images.

During an exchange with one victim, Ingunza called himself a “sociopath” and said he was having “fun,” according to his arrest report.

Ingunza used many fake Instagram accounts, including one called Lizziedoggy15, and accounts he had hacked from other victims, according to CCSO.

Investigators determined the internet activity was occurring at Ingunza’s home on Emperor Lane in southeastern Collier County, according to the sheriff’s office.

On Wednesday, Special Crimes Bureau detectives and SWAT members found Ingunza at home with his mother.

Detectives said they found photographs of one of the victims on Ingunza’s iPhone X and numerous emails from Snapchat about password changes for various accounts, according to Ingunza’s arrest report.

Folders, possibly named after each victim, were found on Ingunza’s iPhone X with lewd photos of the victims, according to his arrest report.

Anyone who believes they may be a victim or has information about the Ingunza case is asked to contact the Collier County Sheriff’s Office at 239-252-9300 or to remain anonymous call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-8477 (TIPS).

CLOSE Here are three ways to submit a tip to Crime Stoppers. Wochit

STAYING SAFE

Use software to monitor children's online activity.

Know what apps your children are using and how they work. Keep the computer in a family room rather than a child’s bedroom.

Enforce social media apps' age requirements and learn children's online dialect.

Avoid posting public photos of children online.

Remember people online may not be who they seem. Someone claiming to be a 12-year-old girl could be a 40-year-old male predator.

If you become aware of child pornography while online, immediately report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s CyberTipline at 1-800-843-5678 or www.cybertipline.com.

1084,Mistrial in case of man accused of threatening to kill U.S. Rep. Brian Mast's kids,"Laurence Key (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY ST. LUCIE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE)

MARTIN COUNTY — A mistrial was declared Thursday in a federal case involving a Stuart man arrested last year after allegations he threatened to kill U.S. Rep. Brian Mast's children over Trump administration immigration policies, according to records and the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

The trial against Laurence Key, 68, charged with one count of communicating a threat to kidnap or injure a person, began Monday in Miami, but there was a hung jury and a mistrial was declared, according to records and Sarah Schall, U.S. Attorney's Office spokeswoman.

Key first was arrested by FBI agents June 18, hours after an intern in Mast’s office in Washington, D.C., reported a man later identified as Key threatened to kidnap and kill Mast's children, a girl and two boys. Mast now has a daughter and three sons.

Key “said something to the effect that he was going to separate the Congressman from his children by kidnapping and killing the children and said it will not be possible to find him,” records state.

Officials ultimately tracked the call to Key’s home in Stuart.

A Martin County Sheriff’s detective and an FBI agent spoke to Key there.

According to a transcript of an interview there, Key told investigators he’d been “calling all day to everybody.”

“Telling people that they are wrong not to oppose this Nazi regime. It's just like Germany in 1930,” Key said.

Key said he had not been drinking or taking drugs.

Asked what he said during the Mast call, Key said, “I told him that what he's doing is wrong and that he's not — that he needs to have some kind of incentive to know how those people felt and he deserves to have — he deserves to be separated from his children.”

It's not the first time Key has gotten into trouble over politics.

Shortly before the 2004 presidential election, Martin County deputies spotted Key pulling up Bush-Cheney signs, tearing them up and putting them in his vehicle, according to arrest records.

A jury found Key guilty of petty theft and criminal mischief and he spent six months on probation after paying $1,259 in fines.

Mast, a Republican from Florida's 18th district, stretching from northern Palm Beach County to Martin and St. Lucie counties, did not take a public stance on the Trump administration's former policy of separating migrant children from their families.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order reversing the policy two days after Key's arrest.

1085,State rests in Bargo resentencing trial,"Forensics expert and medical examiner among Thursday's witnesses; defense starts presenting its case on Friday

Prosecutors on Thursday rested their case in the resentencing trial of Michael Shane Bargo.

Assistant State Attorneys Amy Berndt and Robin Arnold took turns questioning more than 10 witnesses, including sheriff's deputies, forensic specialists, a firearm examiner, medical officials, and those who talked with Bargo about killing 15-year-old Seath Jackson.

James Williams Sr. said Bargo told him he had killed someone and burned his body. He said Bargo told him how many times he shot the victim and details on how and when the murder occurred.

One of Bargo's lawyers, Candance Hawthorne, quizzed Williams about her client's state of mind and asked his impression of Bargo. Williams said at first he did not believe Bargo and was trying to figure out what Bargo told him. He said he never contacted law enforcement, and said Bargo told him the reason he killed the person was because the victim had raped a girl who was close to him.

Bargo, along with co-defendants Amber Wright, Kyle Hooper, Charlie Ely and Justin Soto, have been convicted of Seath’s murder. The co-defendants were sentenced to life in prison, but Bargo was sentenced to death.



In October 2016, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that juries must unanimously recommend death sentences. Bargo’s jury voted 10-2 for death. In June 2017, the Florida Supreme Court granted Bargo resentencing.

Crystal Anderson testified that Bargo told her he was in trouble and had done something crazy. She said he told her he had killed someone and she thought he was not being serious. Anderson said Bargo went into details about shooting the victim eight times, including twice in the face, and burning the boy's body after beating him.

Anderson said she never said anything to anyone because she was scared. When Bargo was arrested in Starke, she said she did not read anything about the murder on social media or any news outlets.

Hawthorne asked Anderson about Bargo's mood. She said when she first met Bargo, she considered him a happy-go-lucky person. But when he was in Starke with them, he was acting sad and depressed as if something was bothering him. Anderson said Bargo told her he did it, meaning the crime.

James Williams Sr. said when Bargo told him about the killing, he told him to turn himself in. Williams said he was shocked.

After his arrest in Starke, Bargo was transferred to the Marion County Jail. There, a fellow inmate, William Faulker, testified Bargo freely told him that the person he killed had raped a girlfriend and he killed him, making reference to Seath. Faulker said he never told anyone about that conversation until three weeks later, when he was released.

In the morning session, Arnold questioned Mike Proctor, the man who gave Bargo the firearm that was used to shoot Seath.

Proctor told Arnold he called the Marion County Sheriff's Office to report that bit of information because it was ""the right thing to do.""

The .22-caliber weapon, together with the box it came in, was given to Bargo in exchange for yard work Bargo did, Proctor said.

Following Proctor's time on the witness stand, sheriff's official Lisa Berg testified about locating Seath's remains and outlined the careful steps taken to preserve the evidence. During this testimony, Seath's mother, Sonia Jackson, left the courtroom.

Seath's body was burned in a burn pit and the remains were placed in buckets. Dr. Michael Warren, retired director of the University of Florida CA Pound Human Identification Laboratory, testified about how those remains were analyzed and determined to be Seath's.

Dr. Kyle Shaw of the Medical Examiner's Office in Leesburg was able to review the evidence, both from the scene and at his office. He told the jury how he concluded that Seath died from a gunshot wound and blunt force trauma.

Hawthorne asked Shaw if he could determine which came first: the gunshot or the blunt force trauma. Shaw said he could not and said a combination of the two caused the teen's death.

Maria Pagan, a firearms examiner, talked about testing the gun used to shoot the teen.

The defense is expected to present its case to jurors starting Friday.

The victim told investigators that over three years, Daniels masturbated in front of and grinded on her multiple times. She detailed several occasions in which Daniels coerced her into touching him sexually and pulling her into his lap while he was naked and touching her while she slept, despite her objections.

“The victim remembers the defendant bribing her with food and sweets,” Tallahassee Police investigators wrote in arrest documents. “He would offer her ice cream, candy or cookies. He would tell her, ‘I’ll give you this candy if you let me do this to you.’”

Daniels has an extensive Leon County criminal history that includes drug charges, aggravated battery and burglary. He was arrested after a meeting with his probation officer Monday.

1091,In search of owner: Lost stuffed animal post goes viral,"- At a Dairy Queen in Oviedo, ice cream cones are swirled to perfection, with the help of a pink-spotted dog sitting nearby.

The dog, nicknamed by the restaurant “Lovely,” is a stuffed animal looking for her long lost owner. The store’s manager, Ryan Allen, is now looking for the dog’s owner, a little girl who left ""Lovely"" behind by accident.

“When you're a kid, your stuffed animal is like their pets or their best friend. It’s defiantly heartbreaking to know that there's some child out there that's missing their loved one,”he said. “They ate ice cream and she left it on the bench, and then they left.”

The store, taking to their Facebook page, saying “We know there is probably a sad kid out there missing their friend. Trying to find the owner of this super cute pup.""

That could have been the end of it, but the posts didn't stop there.

“Day two: still haven't found my person, but the people watching me have lots of ice cream. Miss my kid though, waiting patiently for you to come back for me. #lostlovely.”

That post shared over 1,000 times.

“I mean if free cone day only got six shares and this little puppy dog got a thousand, that says a lot,” the store posted the following day, which it continued to do, throughout the week.

""Day four: got to play outside today, reminded me of the times we went to the park together. Not a moment passes by without the thoughts of you in my mind. ""

It’s now day five, and still no owner. The family, believed to be from Florida, stopped in last week but missed the manager and couldn’t find ""Lovely."" Allen said he’s hoping they come back.



“If they stopped here once...hopefully they'll stop in again.”

1093,"Deputies: Man smoked pot, drank, then drove around with 2-year-old","ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla - A St. Augustine man was arrested after he smoked marijuana, took shots of alcohol and drove around with his 2-year-old stepdaughter, according to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office.

William Patrick Schultz, 36, was arrested Sunday evening on charges of DUI, child neglect and a probation violation, an arrest report shows. As of Monday, he was held in the St. Johns County Jail on no bond.

According to the Sheriff's Office, Schultz's eyes were bloodshot and he smelled of alcohol. He told a deputy that he smokes medical marijuana and had last smoked around noontime. The report showed Schultz was pulled over around 6:44 p.m.

When asked, Schultz told a deputy he had drank a few shots of ""99 proof,"" the Sheriff's Office said. He then requested not to perform a field sobriety test saying, ""I know I'm going to fail.""

According to the arrest report, Schultz's blood alcohol concentration level registered .240 during a breathalyzer test.

Investigators said the young girl's biological mother was called to the scene to take custody of the child and retrieve her car, which Schultz was driving.

1094,Mother claims son's head stomped at Jacksonville day care,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Jacksonville mother is calling for a state investigation into a Northside day care after her 8-year-old boy was hospitalized with a head injury.

The mother, whom we’ll refer to in this story as Jenny, said she was picking up her son Friday from Brighter Futures Learning Center on Lem Turner Road when she witnessed the unthinkable.

“I see a boy just stomping him in the face,” she told News4Jax on Monday. “Punching him and stomping him and stomping him, so immediately I went berserk.”

Jenny said her son was having an asthma attack and complaining of head pain, so she drove him to UF Health Jacksonville, where he was given breathing treatments and diagnosed with a head injury.

On Monday, News4Jax stopped by the Brighter Futures location to speak with the owner. She disputed the mother’s version of events, saying there was only a minor tussle over a game of basketball.

Jenny isn’t convinced, though. She has filed reports with the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office and the Department of Children and Families. News4Jax has requested copies of those reports.

“Just imagine you being a mom and you see this big kid stomping your kid in the head,” she said. “A little girl (in South Carolina) just died from that. You know what I’m saying? That’s unacceptable.”

The case she’s referring to is that of Raniya Wright, a fifth grade student from Waltersboro, South Carolina, who died March 27 -- two days after the 10-year-old was injured in a fight at school.

Jenny said her son wasn’t bruised or bleeding after Friday’s incident, but she noted that he was diagnosed with a mild concussion and had an asthma attack in the car afterward.

“I was so mad,” she said. “I’m so angry about that because, even if she couldn’t see, you should have enough people out there watching (the children).”

OMAHA, Ne. (WOI) - Most grandmothers have a special bond with their grandchildren, but one grandmother from Gretna, NE has an even greater bond. She carried the baby for nine months as a surrogate for her son and his husband.

61-year-old Cecile Eledge delivered five pounds,13-ounce Uma Louise Dougherty-Eledge on Monday, March 25.

When her son Matthew and his husband Elliot Dougherty wanted to expand their family, she volunteered. “There was no moment of hesitation. It was natural instinct.” Cecile Eledge said.

With her age in consideration, Cecile undertook several medical tests before doctors determined her health allowed her to be the surrogate. Dougherty's sister donated the egg and Matthew donated the sperm.

“We are thankful with how the whole process worked,” said Matthew Eledge. “We are really grateful that both Uma and her grandma are here, happy and healthy. For the time being, we’re just going to relax and enjoy this moment.”",https://www.wfla.com/national/61-year-old-grandma-delivers-healthy-baby-girl-for-her-son-and-his-husband/1889748277,2019-03-31T11:16:37Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

1101,"UPDATED: Police now say 1 died at scene of overnight Cove shooting, 3 injured; shooter still on the loose","Panama City Police have identified absconded sex offender Michael Harrison Hunt as a person of interest, according to public information officer Caitlin Lawrence. Police have been looking for Hunt this week, as he has an active warrant for failure to appear April 1 on charges of ""Unlawful sexual activity with certain minors"" and aggravated assault, according to court records. According to an arrest complaint Hunt was already a registered sex offender.

PANAMA CITY —One of the people involved Thursday night in a Cove shooting actually died at the scene on Allen Avenue Thursday night, Panama City police are now saying, while three more remain hospitalized with life-threatening injuries.

The names of the victims have not been released, but police are searching for absconded sex offender Michael Harrison Hunt as a person of interest, according to public information officer Caitlin Lawrence. The truck he was believed to have been driving has been found abandoned in Bay County, Lawrence said.

Police have been looking for Hunt since Monday when he failed to appear April 1 on charges of ""Unlawful sexual activity with certain minors"" and aggravated assault, according to court records. According to an arrest complaint Hunt was already a registered sex offender.

Thursday night's shooting happened at about 10:30 p.m. in the 100 block of Allen Avenue, near the corner with Cherry Street. Two homes there were marked by crime scene tape Friday and it was unknown if the victims were associated with both homes.

According to a press release received at 12:21 p.m. today, ""one victim succumbed to their injuries at the scene. The other three victims were transported to a local hospital for treatment. They all remain in serious condition at this time.""

The department is saying that this is ""not a random act"" and they do not believe there is an immediate threat of danger to people living in the Cove or the rest of the city.

Hunt is described as a black male, 5'09'' tall and around 210 pounds. Hunt is known to operate a black 2015 Ford Explorer with Florida tag ETCT72 and his last known registered address in the 2100 block of E. 5th Street.

People with information on his location are asked to call the police.

Information from police has been slow in coming; one nearby school that heard about it on the Internet sent this message, which some parents who shared it with The News Herald: ""Due to a shooting in the Cove neighborhood, school time this morning is postponed. Parents are asked to keep children at home until the suspect is captured. There is a lockdown location for all students at school today.”

One man who drove by the scene but asked that his name not be used said he was particularly concerned and trying to get information because he had heard the suspect was also wanted for child sex charge, but he didn't know if that was true.

Police have now said it is, and according to courthouse records Hunt was arrested Sept. 12 by the Bay County Sheriff's Office and charged with ""Unlawful Sexual Activity with Certain Minors.""

That investigation, according to court records, began with a Sept. 11 call to Panama City police involving Hunt ""displaying a firearm during a verbal altercation."" According to an arrest complaint, a man confronted Hunt ""about having sexual contact with a neighbor's daughter."" The complaint said Hunt went to his vehicle and lifted his shirt, ""exposing a handgun he had tucked into the right side of his waist band.""

Hunt allegedly told the man, ""This can be taken care of right now,"" according to the complaint.

As police investigated that incident, it led to the discovery that Hunt was involved in sex acts with a minor that occurred outside the city, which started an investigation by the Bay County Sheriff's Office.

A Bay County Sheriff's Office arrest complaint said the girl in that case told them she had sex with Hunt. Hunt, in an interview, admitted to knowing the victim, denied having sex with her and admitted to knowing she was underage.

After his arrest on those charges in September, Hunt made bond but failed to appear in court April 1.

1107,Competitive streak earns Felicity Fonseca spot at Trailblazer Series in California,"PORT ST. LUCIE — For 13-year-old Felicity Fonseca, the hour spent at the Barwis Gym at First Data Field on any given Monday night is a price she’s willing to pay to follow her dream.

Weights, medicine balls, sprints, each drill done with precision and intent as she works to mold her ability and body into the perfect baseball machine. And even though the climb will be steep for Fonseca, a seventh-grade student at Somerset College Preparatory Academy in Port St. Lucie, she is already making a mark.

From April 11 to 14, Fonseca will be one of 96 girls 11 to 13 years old participating in the Trailblazer Series at Major League Baseball’s Compton Youth Academy in California. The event, co-sponsored by MLB and USA Baseball, features competitive play, instruction and other education opportunities for the players whose expenses are entirely paid by MLB.

This is the third year for the series. It is also the third year that Fonseca, who plays for Girls Travel Baseball out of Miami and the Vipers Baseball Club, a travel club based in West Palm Beach comprised primarily of boys, has been invited to attend.

“Basically, they take the top 100 baseball girls and you play a huge tournament,” she said. “You just show them what you got.”

Buy Photo Felicity Fonseca (Photo: AIMEE FORD FOSTER/SPECIAL TO TCPALM)

Fonseca, still shy of 5 feet tall, is a left-handed first baseman who also pitches — fastball, curveball, slider, changeup — and can play the outfield. She recently joined the Vipers, and in her first week was named the starting first baseman for the 13-under team and stepped in as the lead-off hitter. She practices twice a week with the Vipers, swims four times a week with the River Rats Swim Team, attends the Barwis Gym three times a week, and plays random weekends with GTB, which is a national team based in Miami that travels the country playing in tournaments against boys teams.

“I think the GTB is the most rewarding thing I do because those girls are more talented,” Fonseca said. “Playing with those girls is great.”

Fonseca intends to play high school baseball and dreams of college ball and beyond.

“I want to go past college, past the women’s national team,” she said.

Fonseca fell in love with the game nine years ago, after her parents Gus and Ana relocated the family from New Jersey to Port St. Lucie and attended their first spring training session.

“We went to every practice that spring and every minor league game that season,” said Gus Fonseca, who often plays chauffeur for his daughter. He and Ana also have 9-year-old twin boys Seth and Tyler. “Part of the reason was players like Angel Pagan and (Mike) Pelfrey, they would start talking baseball with her, what did she think of the game, what could they have done better. She started thinking about the game at a young age. And she loved it.”

Felicity Fonseca said she doesn’t remember much about those days, “but my parents tell the stories.”

For her, the best part of baseball is “how competitive is it, as a girl playing against boys.”

“I like battling,” she continued. “I like pitching.

“Speed and jumping are my strengths. I bat lead-off, so I have to be fast. I get on base a lot.”

Her father has clearly enjoyed watching her grow in the sport.

“We were in Brazil for three years and she didn’t play much,” Gus Fonseca said. “As soon as we came back, she got involved and we got a hold of the national team. She’s had some cool experiences. We went to the (World Baseball Classic) and the girls got to go on the field.”",http://rssfeeds.tcpalm.com/~/600312628/0/treasurecoast/home~Competitive-streak-earns-Felicity-Fonseca-spot-at-Trailblazer-Series-in-California/,2019-04-03T18:47:54Z,TCPalm,Couple,"1939 SE Federal Hwy, Stuart, FL 34994, USA",FL,34994
1109,Fort Myers Film Festival: Harry Connick trumpeter plays live show after doc screening,"CLOSE Dan Miller and Lew Del Gatto have been playing jazz together for years. They perform every Thursday with their quartet at Fort Myers' The Barrel Room. Charles Runnells, crunnells@news-press.com

Cameron Washington remembers the exact moment he first heard Leroy Jones’ trumpet. He was listening to Harry Connick Junior’s 1991 big-band album “Blue Light, Red Light.”

Then Washington got to the last song, “Just Kiss Me.”

And his mind was blown.

“I heard Leroy Jones, and I said, ‘Oh my God, who is that trumpet player?’” the filmmaker recalls. “He was blazing up a storm. I’ve never heard anything like it.”

Washington ended up buying every album he could find featuring Jones, and that fandom eventually led to some unexpected places — including meeting Jones one day in New Orleans, becoming friends and eventually following the trumpeter around for two years with video cameras.

The resulting 2018 documentary, “A Man and His Trumpet: The Leroy Jones Story,” has been playing U.S. film festivals, and it recently won the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities Award For Documentary Film for 2019. Now it’s opening the Fort Myers Film Festival next week.

Jones, 61, says he’s flattered that anyone would take such a deep interest in his life. But he admits he’s not quite used to being a movie star.

“It’s surreal to me, man,” he says and laughs. “It’s really weird seeing yourself as the main character in a film.”

Jones has had a busy career, playing in New Orleans bands and parades and also recording and touring with Connick from 1990-2007.

Jones is still friends with many members of Connick’s band, including Fort Myers trumpeter Dan Miller. Miller and another famous local musician — saxophonist and former “Saturday Night Live” music arranger Lew Del Gato — will join Jones for a jazz concert after the Wednesday, April 10, film screening at Sidney & Berne Davis Art Center in downtown Fort Myers.

Jones doesn’t know quite what they’ll play yet, but he says it’s bound to be a fun night of bop, swing and traditional jazz. “It’s some seasoned cats, man!”

Film fest attendees are in for a treat, Washington says. No one sounds or plays like Jones — including in the trumpeter’s hometown of New Orleans.

“You’re in a city with a thousand trumpet players, and everybody knows it’s Leroy the second he starts playing,” Washington says. “He’s just got this sound and this connection with his trumpet.”

“A Man and His Trumpet: The Leroy Jones Story” will screen at 7 p.m. at Davis Art Center, followed by an after party and the concert. Tickets are $25 for the film only, or $150 for the film, concert and after party.

That’s not all that's happening at the Fort Myers Film Festival, of course. The ninth-annual event will bring independent feature-length films, documentaries, shorts and more to several Fort Myers locations.

Here are seven more must-see picks from festival founder Eric Raddatz:

“Marcos Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” (9 a.m. April 11 at Davis Art Center): Director David Sutherland’s documentary follows a decorated U.S. Marine veteran who’s fighting to reunite her family after her husband gets deported. Meanwhile, her husband — alone in Mexico — works as a soccer referee, struggles with depression and fights the urge to cross the border illegally. The film will be shown April 15 on the PBS show “Frontline.”

“Wherever we stand politically, we need to address and give voice to how political decisions reverberate into all of our lives, some for good and some for bad,” Raddatz says. “It’s moving and telling and a must-watch here, or on PBS when it comes out.”

Fantasy and science fiction Ursula K. Le Guin, who died in 2018, is the subject of the documentary “Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin."" (Photo: Benjamin Brink, AP)

“Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin” (5:30 p.m. Thursday, April 11 at Davis Art Center): Arwen Curry’s documentary about the beloved science fiction and fantasy writer, who died in 2018. The film looks at her life and legacy with appearances by famous authors such as Neil Gaiman, Michael Chabon and Margaret Atwood.

Some readers consider Le Guin to be a forerunner to modern feminism, thanks partly to her exploration of gender identity, equality and fluidity, Raddatz says. Other just think she was a great — albeit eccentric — writer.

“Ursula K. Le Guin was brilliant, but a really, really different person than most and truly unique as a female science fiction writer in the 60s,” Raddatz says. “The documentary follows her for years, exploring the reasons for her being who she was.”

“Eliades Ochoa From Cuba To The World” (6:30 p.m. Thursday, April 11 at the Alliance for the Arts): A documentary about the life and success of Cuban singer/guitarist Eliades Ochoa, a poor country musician who later found international fame as a member of the Buena Vista Social Club.

“This documentary tackles what it’s like to be true to your style of original music,” Raddatz says. “Most musicians see the need to be original, but Eliades Ochoa, the founder of the group, gives us a unique story on what it is like to be you as a legendary musician.”

“The Great Train Robbery” (8 p.m. Thursday, April 11 at Edison & Ford Winter Estates): The classic 1903 silent film gets a live piano accompaniment for this outdoor screening overlooking the Caloosahatchee River behind the former winter home of inventor Thomas Edison. The 12-minute Western was written, produced, and directed by Edwin S. Porter, a former cameraman at Edison Studios.

“Fly Like a Girl” (6 p.m. Friday, April 12 at IMAG): Director Katie McEntire Wiatt’s documentary about young girls and women pursuing aviation in a field dominated by men.

“Some may say films like this help empower women, but the power is already there,” Raddatz says. “This documentary explores those today who are female and flying high and young girls who are inspired to change the statistics.”

“Long Time Coming: A 1955 Baseball Story” (6:15 p.m. Friday, April 12 at Davis Art Center): Jon Strong’s documentary about racial segregation and two teams of 12-year-old boys stepping onto a baseball field for Florida's 1955 Little League State Championship. It was one of the first integrated Little League games in the South.

The film will be introduced by Glenn Miller, a former The News-Press sports reporter and the current president of the Southwest Florida Historical Society.

“We follow the lives of folks who played the first interracial Little League game in Florida,” Raddatz says. “The humanity of the sport proved greater than the racism so prevalent, proving we are really just alike when we are playing our nation’s greatest sport.”

“Surviving Lunch” (8 p.m. Saturday, April 13 at Davis Art Center): In this drama, a teen moves to Florida after a violent event tears her life apart. Then she sees a bully in the school lunchroom and begins a dangerous quest to stop him.

Raddatz says the film comes along at just the right time in the United States, where Parkland and other school shootings have become commonplace. “Our story takes place in a time where we can’t help but to think, discuss and react to the safety of our children today. The movie is brilliant.”

1112,NTSB releases report for Winter Haven plane crash,"- The National Transportation Safety Board released a preliminary report revealing new details about a plane crash into a house in Winter Haven.

The initial crash happened in late February at a home on Idylridge Way, just south of the Winter Haven Airport. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said 64-year-old instructor pilot James Wagner, of Lakeland, and 33-year-old student pilot Timothy Sheehy, of Bozeman, Montana, were on board when the plane took off from the Winter Haven Airport.

The two were scheduled to perform simulated engine failure training when the plane crashed into a family’s home. Wagner died in the crash, but Judd said Sheehy was able to climb out of the wreckage on his own. He suffered minor injuries.

A 17-year-old girl was in one of the bedrooms and became pinned and trapped after the crash. At first, her injuries were reported as minor; however, the new report states her injuries were serious. The report also states that, so far, investigators have not found any mechanical errors within the plane.

Captain Robert Katz, a commercial pilot and certified flight instructor, said the crash could have been avoided. He explained that, when simulating engine failure, pilots should always be away from homes and fly at a higher altitude than the pair were flying, when they crashed.

“To simulate that low to the ground is a dangerous choice because you’re not giving yourself a lot of room to work with if the recovery doesn’t go as planned,” said Katz.

A full crash report should be available in the next 18 months.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/ntsb-releases-report-for-winter-haven-plane-crash,2019-04-02T03:44:52Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
1113,Man charged with murder after assaulting 4-year-old with Down Syndrome for interrupting: Sheriff,"- A Rancho Cucamonga man has been charged with murder after he allegedly assaulted a 4-year-old girl with Down Syndrome for interrupting him, ultimately resulting in her death, authorities said.

Adam Hughes, 24, was charged with first-degree murder in the death of 4-year-old Kylee Willis.

According to investigators, Huges was watching his girlfriend's children on Tuesday night, when, at some point, Willis angered Hughes by interrupting him. Authorities said Hughes assaulted Willis and then put her to bed.

Several hours later, Hughes noticed the child was non-responsive and that her fingers and lips had turned blue. Authorities said the then called his girlfriend, Corrine Blake, for help.

Blake called 911 at approximately 7:56 p.m. Tuesday. Paramedics arrived and transported the 4-year-old to San Antonio Medical Center for treatment. Willis was then flown to the Loma Linda University Medical Center for treatment for severe head trauma. Authorities said the child was on life support for several days and on March 29, 2019, she died as a result of the injuries caused by Hughes.

On March 27, 2019, both Hughes and Blake were arrested and booked for willful cruelty to a child. Blake was released the following day after posting bail. On March 29, 2019, after Willis' death, Hughes charged with her murder.

Hughes is being held without bond and his next court date is April 2 at the Rancho Cucamonga Superior Court.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/facebook-instant/man-charged-with-murder-after-assaulting-4-year-old-with-down-syndrome-for-interrupting-police,2019-04-01T21:47:47Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Pasco County man is facing a child neglect charge after deputies say he overdosed while caring for two young girls.

According to an arrest report, 37-year-old Scott Duguette was caring for a 1-year-old and a 7-year-old on Friday night in Port Richey when he injected dilaudid and overdosed. Deputies say he had one of the children in his lap and dropped the girl when he fell over.

The 7-year-old child told deputies she ran outside because she was scared Duguette was dead, the arrest report says. Deputies say his neighbors had to give him two doses of Narcan to revive him.

Duguette later admitted to injecting dilaudid and smoking marijuana while taking care of the children, according to the arrest report.

It's a good thing that kitties have nine lives! Mirielle (A180603) is a full figured, spayed female 3(ish)-year-old tabby cat that came to us with horrifying wounds on her neck.

She wasn't talking about how she got them (Chemical burn? Too tight collar?) but we knew she needed treatment. She spent some time in a foster home where she was getting all the TLC she deserves.

Her foster mom says that she's expressive, loves to be with people, runs to greet you - but loves her ""alone time"" too. She's confident, tolerant of her medical treatments and laid back. She is now back at the shelter hanging out in a staff member's office waiting for her perfect person to come along. She's healing very well, and she is guaranteed to make someone very happy!

If you are interested in meeting this special girl, come on in and ask for her at the front desk.

Mirielle’s adoption fee would be $20 which includes her spay surgery, vaccines, and microchip + registration.

1117,Woman with two wombs gives birth to twins 26 days after first baby,"Copyright by WFLA - All rights reserved

TAMPA (WFLA) - A 20-year-old woman with two uteruses unexpectedly gave birth to twins nearly a month after she gave birth to a baby boy.

According to CNN, a Bangladeshi woman identified as Arifa Sultana had twins 26 days after she gave birth to her first child at Ad-Din Hospital in Dhaka.

Sultana has uterus didelphys, a condition meaning she has two uteruses.

Her first baby and her set of twins were conceived and grown in separate uteruses. Doctors say she did not get an ultrasound before the first delivery, so it was missed.

Doctors were able to perform a C-section to safely deliver the twins, a girl, and a boy.

All three children and their mother are all fine.",http://www.wfla.com/national/woman-with-two-wombs-gives-birth-to-twins-26-days-after-first-baby/1890313113,2019-03-31T16:31:44Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1118,More than 100 rescued from Volusia County surf over weekend,"More than a hundred people were saved from the surf along Volusia County beaches over the weekend. That included a young girl dragged out by rip currents in Daytona Beach on Sunday.

According to Capt. Mike Berard, of Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue, rip currents kept lifeguards busy rescuing 48 people Saturday and at least 55 on Sunday.

Of the dozens of rescues made Sunday, the more serious incident involved a 7-year-old girl washed away from shore near the Lennox Avenue approach in Daytona, Berard said.

That child and another juvenile in New Smyrna Beach were transported to hospitals as a precaution, he said.

""The rip currents were pretty bad over the weekend,"" Berard said late Sunday afternoon.

The National Weather Service in Melbourne issued a rip current statement on Sunday for parts of east Florida that included a Volusia County warning about high risk for swimmers.

Weather officials said the greatest risk of rip currents started at 7 a.m. Sunday and continued into late afternoon toward dusk because of tidal effects.

1120,Cape Coral community gathers to support grieving family of 8-year-old killed in hit-and-run,"Hundreds of Lee County residents gathered Saturday to support a family grieving the loss of a little girl.

The event, called Lights for Layla, was held at the Cape Assembly church at 717 Skyline Blvd. in Cape Coral. The event offered bounce houses, face painting, food trucks, raffle prizes, a DJ and more, and raised funds that will support added safety measures at school bus stops.

Layla Aiken, 8, was killed when a pickup truck struck her while she was waiting at a school bus stop with her twin brothers Monday. Police recovered a truck they believe is involved and identified a person of interest, but have yet to make an arrest.

""We need better safety measures for these poor kids that are standing out there when it's dark outside,"" said Angelique Pilcher, her 7-year-old daughter painting a canvas at one of the stations nearby.

Pilcher, 36, said she wanted to show her support because the incident hit so close to home. Her daughter is only one year younger than Layla was, and the family lives about two miles away from the school bus stop where she was hit, at the intersection of Northeast 3rd Avenue and Northeast 19th Terrace.

""So I think you kind of put yourself in that mother's place, and just imagine it being your child,"" she said. ""It's very hard to think of that. There's not much we can do because we didn't know the family, and there's always thoughts and prayers but we wanted to actually do something to try to help a little bit. We are their neighbors.""

The group of organizers behind the event are pushing for increased safety measures at school bus stops.

They started a fundraiser on Facebook after Layla's death, which has raised almost $65,000. That money will help the family pay for the funeral, but will also be used to advocate for safety measures such as lights, benches, and perhaps even monitors stationed at school bus stops in the mornings, according to organizer Lacey Williams.

""This was happening too often, and we just knew that we could do something more,"" Williams said. ""We were able to help Layla's family, and now we can help other families too.""

The group will meet with Cape Coral city officials this week, she said. They first will advocate for stationary school bus stops, because they currently operate on a rotating schedule and change from year to year, she said.

""If we can at least get the bus stops stable, then we can put up lights, benches, things like that to make it a little bit safer,"" she said. ""Unfortunately right now, especially with the time change, it's pitch dark when these kids are at the bus stop. We've got to do something.""

The Lee County School District is evaluating the safety of the school bus stops, and partnering with the Lee County Sheriff's Office and Big Mama and the Wild Bunch at FM radio station B103.9 to raise $100,000 for flashing LED lights that will go on students' backpacks by the next school year.

""It's turned into a really major thing, all in honor of a beautiful little girl,"" Williams said. ""Hopefully nobody else's children will have to go through this.""

Layla was a sweet little girl who loved unicorns, and was her mom's only daughter, Williams said. The girl's mother, Kathleen Aiken, showed up at the fundraiser with her two sons to thank the community and to let the boys see the community support firsthand.

Williams helped make shirts that read #LightsForLayla, which were sold at the fundraiser. Layla's twin brothers arrived shortly before 2 p.m., wearing the shirts, which draped nearly to their knees.

Aiken waded through a sea of hugs, encouraging words and tears. Family friends presented her with a wooden cross that read ""In loving memory of Layla Aiken"" and ""Buggy Layla Rocks."" Aiken called Layla her ""little buggy girl"" as a nickname.

One woman, who appeared to be a close friend, sat on a curb, silently crying as she waited for her turn to comfort Aiken. A musician who was hired to play an acoustic guitar at the event played the song 'Stand By Me' by Ben. E King as they embraced, swaying in place.

Aiken said the tremendous show of support from the community helped her and her grieving sons, who witnessed their sister's death.

""Layla was very social, and she loved everyone and she loved being the center of attention,"" Aiken said. ""She would have loved this.""

Aiken spoke softly of her daughter, her voice broken.

""Obviously the thing I want most is my daughter back. But if I can't have that, this change makes it so what happened to her wasn't in vain,"" she said. ""If I can protect everyone else's babies because there wasn't anyone there to protect mine.""

1122,Deputies: Jailhouse call is 1 of hundreds made to home of 11-year-old,"MIDDLEBURG, Fla. - A jailhouse phone call reveals one of the conversations that deputies said a Middleburg woman had with a man charged with sexual battery on an 11-year-old girl before the woman was arrested on charges of child abuse and witness tampering.

Jason Evans, 39, is charged with capital sexual battery and lewd and lascivious conduct. As of Friday, he was held in the Clay County Jail on no bond. When he was arrested on March 14, records showed he was held on a $1 million bond.

ORIGINAL STORY: Woman accused of abusing 11-year-old after deputies hear jailhouse calls

Investigators said following the assault, the 11-year-old gave birth to a child.

According to the Clay County Sheriff's Office, Evans made hundreds of calls from jail to the home of Danielle Mayhorn, 36, who cared for the 11-year-old. Following those recorded phone calls, Mayhorn was arrested.

By law, Evans was not supposed to have contact with the young girl, but deputies said Mayhorn made that possible by allowing him to talk to child when he called from the jail. News4Jax obtained a portion of those phone calls on Friday, which appear to be from a conversation about legal representation.

Evans: “I’m going to be embarrassed to see her. I was on the other side of the fence before.”



Mayhorn: “She is going to be your best bet. She pulled up your record and said, 'This is the first time he’s ever been in trouble.' I said, 'Yes.'”



Evans: “An attorney I got now says that doesn’t matter.”



Mayhorn: ""Yes. He’s looking at it now as a [expletive] paycheck.”

There were about 700 recorded calls between Evans and Mayhorn, deputies said.

1123,Man gets life in prison for 1997 sex attack on girl in Daytona Beach,"Robert Haar in a mugshot from a 1995 arrest in Hillsborough County on grand theft of a motor vehicle charges.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - A man was sentenced Friday to life in prison after being found guilty in a sex attack of a 14-year-old girl in Daytona Beach in 1997.

Robert Haar, 44, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The case, which involved three men, was cold until the teen's DNA was entered into a national database nearly 20 years after the attack.

""This young lady had to live through it because of your actions, sir,"" Circuit Judge Matt Foxman said. ""For that reason, I’m going to sentence you to the term of your natural life in a Florida state prison without the possibility of parole.""

Haar was arrested in 2017 in Wisconsin and was found guilty on one of two counts of sexual battery with special circumstances.

""This was a little girl who was in the woods running into three strange men with a van and no windows. That’s a start of a horror movie,"" Foxman said.

The assistant state attorney told the judge Haar hasn't had a clean record in the past couple of years, including a crime involving his daughter.

""The court also received a letter from Mr. Haar's daughter regarding other sexual allegations that she’s made against Mr. Haar in recent years,"" Andrew Urbanak said.

Haar was also declared as a sexual predator in the state of Florida.

Anderson's body was found Saturday afternoon in a lake west of Vero Beach after the 24-year-old was reported missing from Avon Park on March 25.

Indian River County Sheriff's Office spokesman Maj. Eric Flowers said deputies were searching near Vero Beach Outlets mall, 1824 94th Drive, when they found Anderson's car.

After searching the area, they found Anderson's body in Keg Lake near the mall.

Flowers said Monday there were no signs of trauma or foul play.

""Nothing leads us to believe that anyone was involved (with Anderson's death),"" he said.

Anderson's body was taken to the Treasure Coast Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy. The Indian River County Sheriff's Office is investigating the incident as a suspicious death.

Nance said Anderson loved to sing and had dreams of becoming a nurse.

""She really didn't do what most adults did like party and hang out,"" Nance said. ""We would do that sometimes because I would pull teeth to get her to do it, but most of the time she was just a hard worker. She was always going to work and making sure all of her things were in order.""

Nance said Anderson worked part time with Comfort Keepers, an in-home care provider company, and enjoyed helping people.

""She just has a sweet spirit; her clients at her job loved her, and she was only with them for a short amount of time,"" she said.

Nance said she first realized her little sister was missing when Comfort Keepers called her and asked if something had happened to Anderson because she missed work.

""She is dependable,"" she said. ""I know out of all of my siblings, if I can't depend on anyone else, I can depend on her (Anderson) to do what she says she's going to do and hold her responsible for it.""

The day before Anderson went missing, Nance said her sister had gotten out of a relationship and called her to talk about it. Nance said she encouraged her sister to come visit her to cheer her up after her shift at work the next day and Nance never saw Anderson again.

1129,Snook lead the catch list and trout action is improving,"CLOSE Wicked windy weather stirred up fishing patterns, but all should be well by the weekend. Ed Killer, ed.killer@tcpalm.com

Indian River County

Joe Cramer of Grant aboard his boat Island Girl fished in the vicinity of Incentive with Capt. Bruce Alcock out of Capt Hiram's Resort in Sebastian over the weekend. At about 330 feet of water, the two boats found a nice color change and blue water. Trolling north the two boats combined to catch about 15 dolphin up to about 27 pounds making for a nice day for both boats. Inshore, there are plenty of rodbenders in the Indian River Lagoon right now. Jacks, ladyfish, small sharks, pompano, trout and redfish are all biting on the flats taking jigs.

St. Lucie County

Capt. Mark Dravo of Y-B Normal charters in Fort Pierce has been steering his anglers to catches of snook, trout and redfish in the shallows around the mangrove shorelines. There has been better fishing in Snapper Cut and St. Lucie Cut, and as the tide comes up, on the flats in front of St. Lucie Village just off the ends of the docks. Use topwater plugs early in the morning at first light. Then switch over to artificial shrimp or soft plastic jigs with curly tails for best bites. Offshore, the seas have been a little big for bottom fishing. Dolphin fishing should be improving. When seas allow, expect a good mangrove snapper bite in 60 to 90 feet of water on live bottom.

The free clinic for children ages 8-14 brought together 60 participants to go through seven activity stations to learn about casting, knot tying, cast netting, lures and tackle, fish filleting, and fish identification, along with proper fishing techniques and ethics, with the help from members of the Stuart Rod and Reel Club.

Martin County

Capt. Marshall Busha of DayMaker Inshore Charters has been doing very well on catch and release fishing for snook for his clients. During a four-hour trip Sunday, Busha put his clients on 28 snook, keeping one slot fish for the frying pan. Tripletail fishing has been pretty good, too. Also, reader Grayson Drexel caught a nice sheepshead in the trough at Stuart Beach using a live shrimp as bait. Few anglers think of catching sheepshead at a sandy beach rather than around a barnacle-encrusted bridge piling.

Lake Okeechobee

Bass fishing remains consistent with the warm weather. Wild shiners are the best bait for chances to catch big fish and big numbers of fish. Anglers who prefer to use artificial lures are finding the best program is to start with topwater frogs or popper-style plugs, spinnerbaits or flat-sided crank baits. Worms and flukes work better later in the day. Bluegill and shellcracker fishing has been steady, too.

1133,Let's fix bus stop issue in Lee County; no more children can die: your say,"0331 Cartoon (Photo: Rick McKee, The Augusta Chronicle, GA)

Dark danger

How many more children must die? The 8-year-old girl killed March 25 was waiting for her school bus at 6:20 a.m. Sunrise was at 7:26 (https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/cape-coral).

In other words, more than an hour too late for this child. We can and should hold the hit-and-run driver accountable for his/her part in this tragedy. But what about the school system that has children walking dark roads and waiting on dark roadsides before daylight?

Perhaps, and I emphasize perhaps, there are good reasons why school hours are what they are. Whatever those reasons might be, are they more important than children's safety? Are they worth a child's life?

Too early

The local news says that the recent death of the 8 year old while she was waiting at her bus stop at 6:20 a.m. school officials state that they don't have responsibility until the student boards the bus. I disagree; the school board is responsible for the start times of school and if they were not so early, that student would not have been there at that dark early hour. What is wrong with this picture?

Waste of time

Where have the nonproductive hours, days, months, years gone? Congress, the House and the Senate, owe the American people a considerable amount of time.

Instead of chasing their tails over the 2016 election they should have been working on health care, Immigration and the country's broken-down infrastructure. But no, they had to have hearings upon hearings and endless interviews and indictments.

What a waste of time. We did not send them to Washington to run around in circles and let the media dictate to them. They were sent their to take care of our country's business. God help us.

Vote counts?

Trump didn't beat Clinton. The archaic Electoral College beat Clinton:

Clinton: 65,844,594; Trump: 62,979,616.

Clinton: 48.2% of the popular vote; Trump: 46.1% of the popular vote.

Two questions

I totally disagree with guest columnist Kimberly Wallace's article appearing in the March 24 News Press, ""The Montessori's difference in raising your child.""

Please absorb the words ""your child."" I am just an 81-year-old husband, father, godfather and grandfather with only a high school diploma who has been a cop for 38 years and I need to ask the Wallace two questions.

1. For the child's sake and benefit and not the parent's who should raise your child?

2. If your gift from God was able to speak and you asked them would they like to be dumped off at Montessori's so strangers could raise them or would they rather be raised by their mother and father at home?

The article states that the Wallaces were overjoyed with excitement about having a little girl. They are missing the excitement when their daughter starts crawling, walking, talking and saying the magic word mommy. Unfortunately the word mommy will take longer because mommy dumped her off at Montessori's.

The article further states that the Wallaces did a lot of research on day care but they should have spent their time researching the best way to raise their child in today's world.

ORANGE CITY, Fla. - A senior female dog was rescued Wednesday after being left tied to a picnic table at an Orange City park, Volusia County Animal Services officials said.

Witnesses said a woman in a newer model motor home dropped the tan-colored pup off at the Valentine Park pavilion around 9 a.m. She left a blanket and water for the dog before driving away. Officials said it's unclear if she was the dog’s owner.

The dog was wearing a black padded nylon harness with two leashes -- one yellow and one orange -- hooked together.

The abandoned dog was ""frightened and confused"" when Volusia County Animal control officers were called to collect her at the park on West French Avenue.

Animal control officers retrieved the dog and brought her to the Southeast Volusia Humane Society, where she will be cared for until she is reclaimed or adopted.

Anyone with information on the dog is asked to call Volusia County Animal Services at 386-248-1790.

1138,Girl asks if dad can sing at Grand Floridian & rest is Disney magic,"Girl asks if dad can sing 'Ave Maria' at Grand Floridian & rest is Disney magic Video

ORLANDO, Fla. (WFLA) - A family tradition turns into a viral moment when a man started singing at the Grand Floridian in Walt Disney World last week.

Justin Gigliello traveled with his family from Connecticut to Disney World. They were having lunch at the resort and he was telling his daughter Lyla how he used to go to the Grand Floridian with his parents to listen to the pianist play in the lobby. So, his daughter wanted to do the same thing.

Justin said he danced with his daughter for a couple of songs and then she went up to the pianist and told him that her dad plays and sings. The pianist went along and asked what song? She said “Ave Maria,” and the rest is Disney and Internet magic.

Reactions on Facebook were how the look on Lyla’s face while he is signing is priceless, and we agree.

Justin started singing when he was 15. “I used to sing as a kid with my dad. He used to play Beatles and Frank Sinatra records at home but I didn’t start taking lessons until 15.”

His parents signed him up with an opera coach and he fell in love with it. He ended up going to school at the Boston Conservatory.

Bravo Justin!

Daniel Rodriguez was taken into custody by St. Johns County deputies around 2:30 a.m. Monday.

Investigators said they found Rodriguez and the victim asleep in the backseat of his car which was parked at the end of St. Johns Parkway.

Deputies said the victim said she and Rodriguez had an on-going sexual relationship for about three months.

1143,"Quacker is a little quacked up, needs help","OCEAN CITY — At first glance, she seems to have it all — a nice place to live (private swimming pool included), plenty of good food, even a roommate named Sylvia.

But appearances can be deceiving. And when Big Girl rises to make her way across her Navy Street living quarters, it's immediately apparent that for her, for now, life isn't all ... well, all it's quacked up to be.

One of her orange legs and webbed feet works fine, but the other doesn't. So when the 9-month old duck wants to go anywhere, her right leg and foot claw at the ground, forcing her to use her extended right wing for leverage to move. Getting to the pool — actually a small pond in one corner of the pen she shares with Sylvia — is an even bigger ordeal.

""If she really wants to go down there, she'll flap her right wing and use her left leg,"" explained Jamie Wilson, who back in January took in Big Girl and Sylvia from a co-worker who didn't have room for the two young ducks.

""When she said she had ducks, I said, 'I've got land. What does it take to raise a duck? You make sure it has water, food, and a pond.""

Until, that is, one of your ducks develops a mysterious limp. Then, raising a duck becomes a whirlwind of visits to veterinarians, and a frantic search for money to fund a needed operation.

About a month after Wilson brought the duck home to the sturdy pen built by Pope — a timber frame covered with stretched-tight chicken wire — she noticed that Big Girl, for some reason, had developed a limp. An initial trip to a local veterinarian revealed no reason for the limp, but when Big Girl's condition worsened, Wilson sought a second opinion.

An X-ray by a second veterinarian revealed that Big Girl had a broken right femur. Surgery to fix the bone, which would involve inserting a pin in Big Girl's right leg to hold the bone together to heal, carries a price tag of $810. That's money Wilson just doesn't have right now, after spending $300 to get Big Girl's problem diagnosed. She's tried to find a veterinarian or animal rescue group that will let her pay off the operation over time, but hasn't been successful.

""They all said they've been burnt before,"" Wilson said.

In the meantime, Big Girl's right leg and foot have become gnarled, and there's a chance that, if the money isn't available soon, Big Girl might be beyond healing.

""It's going on three weeks now,"" Wilson said, ""and sometimes, you can't get the bones back together.""

It's not like Wilson hasn't tried to get the money.

""I had a yard sale, and raised $25,"" she said, almost apologetically.

She's also applied — unsuccessfully — to CareCredit and Scratchpay, two veterinary financing services.

And, Wilson has turned online, to GoFundMe. But, results at her campaign page, ""Surgery for Big Girl,"" (https://www.gofundme.com/surgey-for-big-girl), have been lackluster. As of Wednesday, contributions totaled just $175.

""There's how many people in America?"" Wilson asked rhetorically while feeding Big Girl on Wednesday afternoon, clearly frustrated that more people haven't stepped up to help.

For now, Wilson is taking some solace in the fact that one of her veterinarians told her that ducks are among nature's most resilient and adaptable creatures, and Big Girl might learn to live with a broken or misshapen leg.

""... They're really good at adapting to disability,"" Wilson said. ""I've found videos where they can live with just one leg,"" Wilson said.

But then again, if it comes to that, amputation would cost just about as much as the femur repair surgery, she said.

Which down the road, depending on how Big Girl does if she doesn't get the femur surgery, might leave just one option.

""If, at any point, she seems totally distressed, I would have her put to sleep,"" Wilson said.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190328/quacker-is-little-quacked-up-needs-help?rssfeed=true,2019-03-28T11:07:34Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

Deputies said the 16-year-old girl told a chaperone that she and her other female friends were walking to the school's bus on Friday when a man in a blue shirt groped her as he was walking by the group.

The victim was crying and visibly shaken after the incident, the report said. The man was gone from the area by the time the chaperone was made aware of what happened.

Deputies said the chaperone reported the incident to Disney security the next day and they in turn reported it to the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

The victim, who attends school in Alabama, did not wish to file a formal report.

The man has not been identified.

1149,"Actor Bailey Chase of 'Longmire,' 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' 'Ugly Betty' grew up in Florida","Actor and Naples native Bailey Chase co-stars in a new Netflix Original movie, ""Walk Ride Rodeo."" (Photo: Photo courtesy of Greg Peters)

Bailey Chase for years has played the character viewers often dislike.

The Naples native and father of three says he's enjoying his new roles including the new Netflix Original ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" that premiered earlier this month.

Chase, 46, gained prominence for his acting from 2012 to 2017 on the western crime series ""Longmire,"" in which he played the role of an ambitious Wyoming sheriff's deputy, Branch Connally.

“More than anything, the arc that I got to do on 'Longmire,' that character Branch, he hit all the notes,"" Chase said in a recent telephone interview.

""It gave me a confidence as an actor that I could do anything, I could play good. I could play bad. And by portraying these newer characters, that’s how I connect with the audience more. Then they start rooting for you.”

In his latest role, Chase plays Cory Snyder, the real-life father of Amberley Snyder, a successful rodeo barrel racer who returns to the sport after a car crash.

Bailey and his wife Amy have three children: twin 2-year-olds (a boy and a girl) and a 4-year-old daughter who was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Chase was still shooting ""Longmire.""

“For me as a dad, to play that role, as an actor, you go to those places where I’m imagining my girl in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair,"" Bailey said.

“Since 'Longmire' and becoming a dad, I feel like I can play anything.”

He grew up in Naples, living in the seaside town from age 4 through his freshman year at Naples High School. He transferred to the Bolles School in Jacksonville where he played football and baseball and graduated from the private school before heading to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

After graduating from Duke with a bachelor's degree in sports psychology, Chase said, he decided to fulfill ""a boyhood dream"" and headed to Los Angeles instead of New York.

""I came out here, being a Florida boy,"" Chase said. ""The climate was a little bit better. I was living at the beach, waiting tables and going to acting class.”

He eventually traveled overseas to become a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), to study Shakespeare.

When he returned to the U.S., he landed a role on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" a television series that ran from 1997 to 2003. For the next few years, Chase portrayed Chris Robert Hughes on the soap opera ""As The World Turns.""

He co-starred as ""Becks"" Scott in the ABC comedy-drama ""Ugly Betty,"" which ran from 2006 to 2010, and on the TNT series ""Saving Grace"" that was ran between 2007 and 2010.

But his most notable role came in 2012, when he began on ""Longmire"" that began on the A&E channel and, later, Netflix. Actor Robert Taylor starred as Walt Longmire, a stoic, rugged, no-nonsense sheriff who revealed his Australian accent away from the camera, Chase said.

""He’s a good dude,"" Chase said of Taylor. ""It was a strong cast. We were all distinctly different.”

Longmire"" also co-starred actress Kate Sackhoff and actors Lou Diamond Phillips and Gerald McRaney, known for his TV roles on ""Major Dad"" and ""Simon & Simon"" that Chase said he grew up watching.

Upcoming work for Chase include a role this summer on season 4 of ""Queen of the South,"" a crime drama on the USA Network. Chase said he's been flying to New Orleans for filming and returning home to LA every weekend.

All he said he could reveal about his character is that he's ""a jazz musician with a dark past.""

Chase said he still has family in Florida, including a brother who's a builder based in Ocala. He hasn't been in Naples for more than a decade but hopes to visit again one day.

“Growing up down there, I couldn’t wait to get out,"" he said of Naples.

""But once I got into my 20s and my 30s, I always enjoyed coming back home. Naples will always be home. It's so humid; it just has a feel and a smell. It’s very nostalgic for me.”

The National Transportation Safety Board has released a new report detailing what caused a plane to crash into a Winter Haven home earlier this year.The preliminary report by the NTSB found said no mechanical problems were found during an initial review of the engine and fuselage.Pilot and flight instructor James Wagner died after the plane crashed into a home on Feb 23. Timothy Sheehy, of Montana, survived with minor injuries. A 17-year-old girl who was in the home at the time of the crash was also hurt. According to the NTSB aviation accident preliminary report, the twin engine seaplane, a STOL Aircraft Corp UC-1 amphibious airplane, took off from Winter Haven Regional Airport at 12:43 p.m. Sheehy told the NTSB that Wagner advised him before takeoff that he would introduce a simulated engine failure. After reaching 200-300 feet, Wagner reduced throttle on the left engine. A witness on the ground, operating a fuel truck, also provided information that the left engine propeller was not spinning when the plane began to turn.Sheehy told the NTSB that the engine restart procedure was unsuccessful and attempts to make an emergency water landing nearby were unsuccessful. The plane crashed into the house, briefly trapping the 17-year-old, Carmelle Ngalamulume, who was rescued by neighbors.Neighbor Moses Saint Hillaire told WFLA-TV ""Half of her body is through the wall and the other half was in her room. We promise, we (were) not going to leave you.” Saint Hillaire continued, “I told her I said listen, if anything happens, if the plane catch on fire, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to pull you out. Cause I'd rather pull you out and you be injured than you know, you catch on fire.”Her mother, Emerance Ngalamulume, and brother, Joel Ngalamulume, were inside as well but were not harmed. Children playing in the driveway also were not hurt.The NTSB conducted a test run of the left engine, and the report notes, “the engine started immediately, accelerated smoothly, and ran continuously at all selected power settings without interruption.” It further reads, “No evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction was noted during the examination of the recovered airframe and engines.”According to the report, the plane had its 100-hour inspection the same day as the crash.NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss told WESH 2 News, “This report represents an initial review of the evidence collected at the scene. No probable cause will be determined until we release a final report.”Wagner was considered an accomplished pilot and instructor, in particular with seaplanes. His most recent FAA first-class medical certificate was issued January 25, and he reported 15,000 total hours of flight experience on that date.",https://www.wesh.com/article/ntsb-no-mechanical-malfunction-when-plane-crashed-into-winter-haven-home/27007752,2019-04-01T17:06:00Z,WESH-TV,Couple,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789
1156,"Ocala Scouts, now including girls, enjoy Pinewood Derby","Classic event is a chance for kids and family members to work together.

Imagination supplied the spark and gravity provided the fuel on Saturday as Cub Scouts ranging from kindergarten age to the fourth grade rolled their hand-crafted wooden model cars down a four-lane inclined track while surrounded by cheering family and friends at the annual Scouts BSA North Florida Council/Marion District Pinewood Derby.

The top three winners in each of five categories will go to the regional finals on May 4 at Bass Pro Shop in Gainesville.

This year's competition, held at St. Paul's United Methodist Church, included the first participation in the races by girls in Marion County Cub Scout packs.

Steve Hickman, cubmaster of Tiger Pack 18, said girls were admitted into Scouts BSA as of February 2018, and five of the 57 racers at Saturday's event were girls. Hickman referred to the ""inclusive environment"" at the event and praised it as a ""full family experience.""

Annabelle Cruce, 7, of Tiger Pack 18, raced a pink ""Unicorn Fantasy"" car and took third place in the Tiger division, making her the first female scout to place in the local Pinewood Derby. She will advance to Gainesville.

She was adamant that the pink paint made her car go faster, but she also ""took a weight off.""

The track used at the event Saturday was made of metal rather than wood. The competition had computerized scoring and a clock.

Teresa Lanning, committee chair with Boy Scout Troop 692 and Cub Scout Pack 692 and scoutmaster of the six-member Scouts BSA Girl Troop 692, said during the event that she has ""the first female scout in the area who received the Arrow of Light award and crossed over to Scouts BSA Girl Troop 692.""

""Two other girls have earned their Arrow of Light and will be crossing over soon from their Cub Scout pack,"" Lanning said.

Marion District Pinewood Derby Chair Bill Holland said the event is aimed at fostering qualities like leadership and sportsmanship. Holland's wife, Robin, and their son, Casey, 11, have participated in five prior races, and a shelf at their home holds past entries including one called ""Sting Like A Bee.""

Cub Scouts assemble their own scale cars, which may be no heavier than 5 ounces, Hickman stated. Entrants focus on weight placement, axles and alignment.

Hickman said this was also the inaugural year for kindergartners to race in the Lions division.

The cars are often a joint venture involving scout and parents; as they grow older, many scouts complete their own cars.

Keileb Negron, 9, took first place in the third grade Bears division. His parents, Jackeline Negron and Tony Duarte, cheered him on as he bested the other entries with his ""Golden Dasher"" car.

Daniel and Gina Gentry were at the derby with their sons Anthony, 9, racing in his fourth event, and Daniel III, 12, who raced in four prior derbys and is now a Scout. Anthony took third place in the Webelos, or fourth grade, division.

Jeremy Harrell enjoyed an afternoon of racing with his stepson Ethan, 6.

Truman Magley, senior Marion district executive, said the district now has about 30 female scouts in three troops. He said the Pinewood Derby is a chance for ""scout and parents to work together to develop skills.""

Ryan and Jessica Pilch came to the races with their daughter, Vivian, 8, and son, Ethan, 5, both in Scouts USA. Ethan finished second in the Lions or kindergartner division.

Vivian said she was drawn to scouting by archery, and she likes outdoor activity.

""Girls can camp, too,"" she said.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190401/ocala-scouts-now-including-girls-enjoy-pinewood-derby?rssfeed=true,2019-04-01T11:22:52Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471

1158,"Leesburg men shot at children walking home, used racial slurs, police say","James Reidnauer, 31, and Brent Van Besien, 33, are accused of calling two Leesburg children racial slurs and shooting at them.

LEESBURG, Fla. - A Lake County mother can be heard in a 911 call telling her children to stay down and away from the windows after two white men called the siblings racial slurs and shot at them sending them running home.

The 12-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy were walking home on Goose Prairie Road March 17 from the BP gas station and cut through the area near a church when the victims said James Reidnauer, 31, and Brent Van Besien, 33, confronted them.

The area where the victims were walking was near the Lisbon Church of God where Lake County students are picked up and dropped off by the school bus, the victims' mother said in the 911 call.

""They tried to block them in before with their truck,"" she said.

The siblings said Reidnauer asked, ""What are you doing?"" to which the 16-year-old said ""just walking home with his sister.""

At which point Reidenauer again asked ""What are you doing?"" and Van Besisen called the 16-year-old a racial slur before both men fired their guns at the children, according to the arrest report.

The siblings ran home and in the 911 call from their mother it's clear they were running out of fear. Police who responded said neither child was injured but ""both were visibly frightened.""

[WARNING GRAPHIC LANGUAGE IN 911 CALL BELOW]

In the 911 call the mother tells her children they shouldn't have even responded to the men's questions, ""You don’t ever speak you just run.""

When deputies spoke with the suspects, both men said they had confronted two ""meth heads"" and Reidnauer fired ""a warning shot into the ground to prevent them from breaking into the house."" Van Besien, who is a convicted felon, said only Reidnauer fired the shot. Deputies said they found bullet casings from a Smith and Wesson 9 mm.

Both men described the victims as a ""brown guy"" and a ""white girl"" who were in their 20s or 30s, according to the report. Deputies said Van Besien ""then changed his story saying he never actually got a good look at the people because he was quite a distance away.""

Reidnauer and Van Besien are both charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a firearm during a hate crime. Van Beisen faces additional charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

Lake County Jail records show both suspects were booked into the jail March 18 and have not posted bond.

As a dispatcher tried to calm the mother telling her to take deep breaths. She responded ""We have to get out of this neighborhood.""

""They weren’t doing anything,"" she said. ""All they did was walk home from the store.""

1159,"People born in this month are the smartest, study finds","If you were born in September, apparently you are smarter than people born in any other month, and now, you have a study to back you up.

A published study in the National Bureau of Economic Research shows a clear association between your smarts and the month in which you were born.

If you were born in any other month, read on, because we have some news that may soothe your concerns.

The study, named School Starting Age and Cognitive Development, analyzed cognitive development in 1.2 million school children between the ages of 6 and 15 in Florida.

There is a bit of a caveat. The determination that those born in September had a higher grade average was likely because they were among the oldest when starting school, the study found.

Because many states require students going into kindergarten to be 5 years old before Sept. 1, those children begin school the following year, just on the verge of being 6 years old.

The study, Marie Claire reported, showed the age difference can have an impact on development. In addition, those born in August — who would be the youngest in their class — had the lowest grade average, seemingly backing up the theory.

For those not born in September, there’s no need to fret! The study also revealed that all other children will eventually catch up to their older counterparts.

Lee County students who wait for school buses in the dark morning hours will be able to adorn their backpacks with flashing LED lights starting next year.

Local agencies are partnering to raise money for the new safety protocols after the death of 8-year-old Layla Aikens, who was hit by a pickup truck while waiting at her bus stop with her brothers Monday morning.

The Lee County School District is partnering with the Lee County Sheriff's Office and Big Momma and the Wild Bunch at FM radio station B103.9 to raise $100,000 for flashing LED lights that every student can attach to their backpacks, according to a school district news release.

""The safety of our students is always our highest priority,"" said Superintendent Greg Adkins. ""With the community's support, we can raise the money to provide every bus rider a bright, flashing light they can attach to their bag or backpack so they can be even more visible while waiting for their bus in the morning.""

The sheriff's office and the school district will commit $20,000 and $10,000 respectively. The sheriff's office will also establish a nonprofit called ""Compassionate Cops"" to manage the donations and help purchase the lights.

“We will devote all of the time, effort and resources necessary to protect the students of Lee County,"" said Sheriff Carmine Marceno. ""I can't think of anything more important. And we will continue to work closely with the school district to ensure the safety of our students.""

At the moment, only checks sent to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office with Lights for Layla written in the memo line can be accepted as donations.

Once the nonprofit is established, information about making donations online will be posted on the sheriff’s office Facebook page and the school district's Facebook page. It is anticipated the lights will be purchased this summer and distributed to students before the start of the next school year in August.

Meanwhile, Layla's family and friends will host their own fundraiser called Lights for Layla Saturday at the Cape Assembly church from 1 to 3 p.m. The event will raise money for awareness for increased safety for children at bus stops, and will offer bounce houses, face painting, a DJ, balloon animals, food vendors, and more, according to an event flyer.

Authorities have seized the pickup truck involved in the deadly crash and have identified a person of interest, but have not yet charged or arrested anyone.

1166,Prosecutor: Pastor encouraged other ministers to have sex with 'groomed' teenager,"Advertisement Prosecutor: Pastor encouraged other ministers to have sex with 'groomed' teenager Share Shares Copy Link Copy

A minister who promised a woman he’d take care of her daughter began having sex with the teenager daily and later encouraged two other pastors to have sex with her as well, federal prosecutors said Monday.Anthony Haynes could face up to life in prison if he’s convicted of child sex trafficking and other charges. The two other Toledo-area pastors charged in the investigation have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.Prosecutors said during the opening of Haynes’ trial that he first had sex with the girl when she was 14. They said the evidence against him includes text messages, photos, voice mails and DNA evidence from his church where the girl said they often had sex.Haynes’ attorney told jurors that the allegations are shocking, but there’s not enough evidence to prove the trafficking and conspiracy charges he faces.Attorney Pete Wagner also said Haynes may have had a questionable relationship with the girl, but he didn’t coordinate or take part in trafficking her to the other ministers. He also said there was no paying for sex.Prosecutors say the girl had a difficult childhood and was sexually abused by a relative.Haynes pledged in front of his congregation to protect her and serve as a father figure, but he began grooming her for sex when she turned 14 and first forced her to perform sex acts in front of him, said Michael Freeman, an assistant U.S. attorney.They had sex day after day, often at a motel or his church, the Greater Life Christian Center in Toledo, and Haynes would give her cash, Freeman said.After about a year, Haynes introduced her to Kenneth Butler, another pastor, and he also began having sex with her, Freeman said.Sometimes, the two men joked about the arrangement, prosecutors said. One text shown in court that prosecutors say was sent by Butler to the girl said: “You better be nice and naked when I get there.”Prosecutors said the girl next met Cordell Jenkins, a minister who founded his own church in Toledo and built a large following until it closed after his arrest.The FBI has said in court documents that Jenkins had sex with two girls at his home, church office and a motel and often recorded the acts with his phone.Haynes, prosecutors said, encouraged the relationship with Jenkins.In addition to the charges against the men, Haynes’ wife and stepdaughter are accused of abducting the girl at gunpoint in January and warning her not to testify at his trial.Court documents say the pair forced the teenager from her apartment, choked her with a cord and told her to take back statements she made to investigators. Attorneys for Haynes’ wife and stepdaughter have declined to comment.Just before her husband went on trial, his wife appeared Monday in the same courtroom where the judge overseeing the case turned down her request to be released.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/prosecutor-pastor-encouraged-other-ministers-to-have-sex-with-groomed-teenager/26947613,2019-03-27T15:56:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

Deputies with the Marion County Sheriff's Office said Jonathan Erick Doody II was arrested Tuesday after the girl told investigators Doody had sex with her several times last summer.

[MORE: Florida man claims to be 'Insta famous,’ lures, rapes Texas girl, police say | Real estate agent raped woman who was house hunting, police say]

Authorities said the girl decided to report the alleged incidents after learning Doody was charged with lewd and lascivious behavior on a victim 12-16 years of age in January, after being accused of molesting a 15-year-old girl.

While reporting the alleged incidents, the 13-year-old girl gave investigators detailed accounts of the alleged sexual encounters and was able to describe Doody's bedroom in great detail, deputies said.

Doody denied the allegations and told investigators the girl had never been to his house, according to the Sheriff's Office.

Following his arrest Tuesday, Doody faces two counts of lewd and lascivious battery on victims 12-16 years of age, records show.

Due to information learned throughout the investigation, detectives believe there may be additional victims. Anyone with information about other potential victims is asked to call the Marion County Sheriff's Office at 352-368-3508.

1176,Pirates earn diamond split with Father Lopez,"Chad Taylor drove in four runs during three separate rallies Friday night and Nathan Quinn handcuffed the Green Wave batters for six innings to give the Pirates a 7-1 win and a split of the season series in district games last week.

Matanzas knocked out eight hits in the game, including a fifth-inning double by Andrew Butler, who also scored twice. Sean Sparling singled and scored a run and Joseph Alvarado was 2-for-3 with a run scored for the Pirates.

Quinn benefitted from timely hitting and his own ability to throw strikes. He fanned 12 over the course of six innings and gave up a paltry three hits. A third-inning single by the Wave’s Grayson Chastain drove in the visitors’ lone run.

Cameron Quintana pitched one inning of scoreless relief for the Pirates.

Father Lopez 8, Matanzas 2: In the opening game of the series March 26, the Green Wave touched Matanzas starter Eric Libby for seven hits and seven runs, only four earned, over five complete innings. The Pirates avoided a shutout in the top of the seventh trailing 8-0 when Alvarado hit an RBi double and Kyle Perry drove in another run on a fielder’s choice ground out.

1179,Face the fear of fundraising with focus on mission |Notes on Nonprofits,"Buy Photo Alyce Lee Stansbury (Photo: Democrat files)

For many board members, asking for money is their biggest fear and most daunting board responsibility. For Executive Directors, fundraising without board involvement is a frustrating, unrelenting challenge. Given the unpredictability of public funding, changing legislative and funder priorities, and shifting donor interests, it is a good time to revisit my previous column on facing the fear of fundraising.



It might surprise people to know I haven’t always loved asking for money. As a child, the only fundraising I was good at was selling Girl Scout cookies. I’ve always contended this is because thin mints practically sell themselves! To be successful, all I had to do was show up in my uniform, circle the neighborhood with my red wagon full of cookies, and ring the doorbell.

People knew instantly why I was there and quickly scanned my wagon to see if I had their favorite variety. At one point in my cookie career, I was the top salesperson for my troop. As I look back on this, I realize how similar that process is to the fundraising I help my clients do now. Half the job is showing up, being credible, and putting your worthy cause in front of someone who knows and believes in your product.

Facing the twin fears of rejection and failure are what most people dread most about fundraising. A great deal of my work is teaching people how to face these fears by finding their niche in the fund development process, being an advocate for the mission, and remembering they are not asking for themselves but for a worthy cause. This includes learning how to listen to what’s important to donors as part of earning the right to ask.

For me, asking for a gift is a privilege and an opportunity to change or save a life. I’m also a big believer that practice is the best teacher. There’s no substitute for asking and learning how to get better with every ask.

According to Leading with Intent: A National Index of Nonprofit Board Practices, 60% of CEOs and 58% of board chairs identify fundraising as one of the most important areas for board improvement. This statistic mirrors my experience as a fundraising professional, consultant, and board member.

Over the past 25 years, I’ve known board and staff members in all types and sizes of nonprofits who have bemoaned the task of fundraising. As a consultant, I received a call from a prospective client who began the conversation with a heavy sigh and in a despondent, defeated tone, said, “I’ve put this off as long as possible” because they didn’t want to fundraise but needed to learn. I’ve also seen nonprofit staff and volunteers face down their fear of fundraising and move past it, many with amazing success.

Although I’m a huge fan of what fundraising can do to change lives, I’ve never thought it was easy. Because it isn’t. And I’ve had more than my share of fearful moments, shaky asks, rejections, and outright disasters. In spite of this, I don’t believe fundraising is the drudgery some people think it is.

Hank Russo penned my favorite definition of fundraising: the gentle art of teaching people the joy of giving. It is not cold calling or arm twisting. Fundraising is talking with people about something they care about and giving them a meaningful opportunity to act on that feeling.

The best fundraisers I know are passionate advocates for the mission and helping donors accomplish their goals and dreams by making a gift. As author and blogger Jeff Brooks says, fundraisers have to speak to a donor’s dreams, and I agree.

Perhaps my cookie sales did more to lay the ground work for my life’s work than I thought. With or without cookie selling experience, I’m a firm believer most board and staff members can be successful fundraisers. I agree with grassroots fundraising author Kim Klein who says, “What you believe in has to be bigger than what you’re afraid of.”

It starts with showing up, listening to what donors are interested in, and when there’s a match, putting your worthy cause in front of them and asking. And remember, if you’re not asking, someone else is.

1180,Marion County marks 175 years with celebratory festival Saturday,"The celebration at the McPherson Government Complex in Ocala featured music, food, speeches and celebrants in period clothing to commemorate the March 25, 1844, signing that formed Marion County from parts of Alachua, Mosquito (now Orange) and Hillsborough counties.

Marion County celebrated the 175th anniversary its founding on Saturday, with a celebration at the McPherson Government Complex in Ocala.

The celebration commemorated the signing on March 25, 1844, by Richard Keith Call, territorial governor, of legislation authorizing the formation of Marion County from parts of Alachua, Mosquito (now Orange) and Hillsborough counties. A year later, Florida was admitted to the union.

Settlers had agitated for the formation of Marion County because the nearest county seat was at Newnansville, now the town of Alachua, and the journey there was over 50 miles of all-but-impassable sand trails, Darrell G. Riley wrote in “Marion County History,” a 1997 Star-Banner special section.

“Not many people know we became a county a year before Florida became a state,” said Sheriff Billy Woods, dressed in 1840s-style clothing astride his horse, Bull, as he greeted attendees.

Michelle Stone, chairwoman of the Marion County Commission, opened the program with a welcome featuring local elected officials, among them State Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala.

“You’re building a great Florida future for those who come behind us,” Baxley told the audience. “We’re making history, recognizing that we stand on the shoulders of those who came before.”

But while the overall tone of Saturday’s event was celebratory, a roster of speakers giving 15-minute talks in the County Commission auditorium did not shy away from the harsher realities of county history.

Morrey Deen, a former Ocala chief of police, described a complicated and bloody series of events in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that brought Creek Indians and runaway African-American slaves to central Florida, evoking images of Spanish gunrunners, Andrew Jackson and bounty hunters hired by slave owners. He told of the Treaty of Moultrie Creek between the U.S. government and Native American tribal leaders that created a 4-million-acre Indian reservation that stretched from north of Ocala to south of Lakeland. Deen also recounted the aftermath of the Seminole Wars, in which the government relocated Seminole Indians from Florida to Oklahoma.

“The shame of it is, you know what we did?” Deen said. “(The U.S. government later) pushed them out of Oklahoma because we had the great land rush.”

Cynthia Wilson-Graham presented a talk on Paradise Park, the attraction on the Silver River, alongside Silver Springs, for African-American tourists. Wilson-Graham, author of “Remembering Paradise Park: Tourism and Segregation at Silver Springs,” noted that Silver Springs had a black workforce in the days of segregation that was barred from visiting the park as tourists.

“They could work there, they could garden, they could take guests on the boat rides, but they could not mingle with the guests,” she said.

Wilson-Graham said that until the desegregation of Silver Springs in 1969, both parks were marketed nationally to tourists and Paradise Park was home to large Labor Day celebrations and annual gatherings of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

“The guests that went to Silver Springs had somewhere to stay,” Wilson-Graham said. “They could be accommodated in different hotels and motels, but for the guests of Paradise Park, they had maybe one or two hotels here. They had to basically, go and stay at houses with other people.”

Outside, Saturday’s event included festival-like touches like musical entertainment, food trucks and booths staffed by representatives of local government agencies, companies and nonprofit organizations.

Karin Ahrman of Ocala worked a booth for the Marion County chapter of Harley’s Dream, a nonprofit organization dedicated to banning commercial dog breeding enterprises known as “puppy mills.”

“The traffic’s been pretty good,” Ahrman said at about noon. “We’ve handed out about 150 temporary tattoos for children, 100 pet food lids and I don’t know how many of our bracelets.

“(Turnout) isn’t as big as I thought, but it’s starting to get crowded,” she said.

In the lobby of the commission auditorium, organizers displayed the contents for a time capsule to be opened in 25 years for the county bicentennial, including: badges contributed by local first-responder agencies; an anniversary proclamation from the Dunnellon City Council; and a shell casing found at the Ocklawaha site of the 1935 shootout between the Barker-Karpis gang and FBI agents that killed Ma Barker and her son, Fred, donated by George Albright, county tax collector.

At the close of the celebration, Brandon Kalloo, a public information officer with the county, said traffic counters were still tabulating figures but estimated the day’s attendance at “several thousand.”

Festivities were to conclude with night fireworks at the Marion County Veterans’ Park.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190330/marion-county-marks-175-years-with-celebratory-festival-saturday?rssfeed=true,2019-03-30T17:23:57Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471

1182,How is Meghan Markle winding down her pregnancy?,"If all goes according to plan, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will welcome their first child likely in the next month or so.

The royal couple never released a firm due date, but most reports agree that the baby is likely expected in late April.

So, how is Markle, a glowing mom-to-be, keeping busy these days?

A source close to the couple spoke with Elle about that very topic, saying Markle is feeling great. She will continue working just a bit longer before taking a well-deserved break from royal engagements.

“The Duchess of Sussex is winding down her schedule by end of March,” the article says. “Though sources say she may do one more public engagement before the baby is due, Meghan has been holding several meetings privately related to her humanitarian work. Meghan had one such meeting last week.”

The royal couple also will move, which doesn’t sound very appealing toward the end of a pregnancy, although it seems as though this was beyond Markle and Prince Harry’s control.

The pair is slated to leave Kensington Palace -- which is also the estate where Prince William, Kate Middleton and their three children live -- and move into Frogmore Cottage.

Royal commentator Emily Andrews, of The Sun, tweeted about the Frogmore Cottage delays earlier in the week.

Update on #frogmorecottage: Harry & Meghan were due to move in this week just gone, but their move has been delayed by three weeks or so. The renovation work has been huge to turn this mini-mansion back into a family home so it’s no real surprise that builders fell behind 1/4 — Emily Andrews (@byEmilyAndrews) March 24, 2019

""Harry and Meghan kept changing their minds on design aspects, putting the builders back (like all homeowners ever -- they want it to be perfect!),"" Andrews also said, according to published reports.

Elle reports that Frogmore Cottage is a 10-bedroom house given to the couple by the queen. The home “has more space for children” and Markle and Prince Harry even had their second wedding reception there, with the wedding ceremony itself nearby at Windsor Castle.

Nicholas Hughes was sentenced in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida Friday. He was convicted of enticement of a minor, production and possession of child pornography on Jan. 4.

Throughout the 2016-2017 school year Hughes, then a teacher at Coast Charter Schools in St. Marks, and the girl had various sexual encounters. They communicated via social media, cell phone and texts and send pornographic photos back and forth.

Hughes was arrested at his home in Leon County in Nov. 2017. Investigators seized a laptop, camera and cellphone used to transmit the images and communicate.

In his announcement of the sentence, U.S. Attorney Lawrence Keefe said Hughes violated the trust placed in educators.

“Children see their teachers as role models and mentors, and in this tragic case, the defendant took advantage of that trust,” Keefe said in a statement. “Together with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners, we will pursue child predators and bring them to justice.”

1186,FWB family lovingly remembers daughter,"FORT WALTON BEACH — She obsessed over unicorns, acted like a comedian and earned straight A's in fourth grade at Kenwood Elementary School.



The family of 10-year-old Skyla Morgan Schindler, or “Skyla Boo” as they called her, had the life she loved taken from her when she collided with a tree skiing at Breckenridge Ski Resort near Denver on Thursday, March 21. Her family annually took skiing trips.



One of the fondest memories the family has of their bubbly little girl involves unicorns. Skyla often said she was a unicorn. She and her dad would laugh and laugh about the rainbow-colored soap at the car wash. They pretended it was actually unicorn poop and the reason their car turned out so shiny.



A spitting image of her mother, Skyla was outgoing, smart, adventurous, bold, had a huge heart and was all smiles, the family said.



She also loved being outdoors on the water with her family. Additionally, she enjoyed playing softball as a catcher and outfielder.



Besides unicorns, the family recalled her other favorite things were the color purple and eating chicken caesar salad.



In an email to the Daily News, the family invited the community to join them as they plan on “celebrating Skyla’s amazing life and outgoing personality” at a memorial in her honor at 6:30 p.m. Saturday at The Gulf on the Okaloosa Island.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190328/fwb-family-lovingly-remembers-daughter?rssfeed=true,2019-03-28T14:13:42Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

1194,Pembroke Pines man accused of molesting girl over course of 10 years,"Wayne Lincoln Chin, 57, is accused of molesting and raping a girl over the course of 10 years.

PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. - A Pembroke Pines man was arrested Monday on accusations that he molested and raped a girl numerous times over the course of 10 years.

According to an arrest report, the incidents began in 1998 when the alleged victim was 4 years old and continued until she was 14.

Pembroke Pines police said the victim, now 25, told detectives that Wayne Lincoln Chin, 57, started the abuse by touching her breasts and vagina under her clothing while telling her, ""Just relax.""

Police said he later began digitally penetrating her and eventually forced her to engage in oral sex and intercourse.

According to the arrest report, it has been five years since the victim last communicated with Chin.

Police said multiple controlled calls were placed with the accuser and Chin, in which Chin admitted to engaging in sex acts with her, bragged about taking her virginity and told her he loved and missed her.

Authorities said Chin asked the victim to meet him this week to engage in sex acts.

Chin was taken into custody Monday on charges of sexual assault on a minor and lewd and lascivious molestation of a minor.

Police said Chin claimed he only engaged in sex acts with the victim when she was an adult, however authorities said he contradicted himself multiple times during questioning and told detectives, ""How can you arrest me for something I did 20 years ago?""

Police said he also claimed, ""I did not rape her. I just lay in her bed and sleep with her.""

Chin is being held at the Broward County Jail.

Police said they received unconfirmed information that Chin previously worked as a soccer coach in Pembroke Pines during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

""If accurate, he would have had contact with several juveniles during said timeframe,"" the Police Department said in a news release. ""Due to the nature of this incident, the possibility exists that there may be additional victims related to this crime.""

Anyone who believes they or their child were victimized by Chin is asked to call the Pembroke Pines Police Department or Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477.

The defendants are set to be arraigned next month.

1227,Running with brushes: Naples Art Association hits 65 years in full stride,"Just eight days before her death in 1954, the colorful, intense artist Frida Kahlo splashed a title on her last painting, a symbolic array of plump watermelons: ""Viva la Vida."" Live the life.

It could have been the charter for the nascent organization being forged far away in Florida. That same year, 37 artists, an impressive number in the small fishing and vacation spot of Naples, banded together as the Naples Art Association. Their mission: to promote local art, show it and even teach it in Collier County schools until it became an approved part of the curriculum.

Those founding artists succeeded beyond their wildest dreams:

Naples Art Association now offers three annual shows that turn Fifth Avenue South into a sea of nearly 250 American artists and six local ""Art in the Park"" shows during visitor season. (The last one until autumn is next Saturday, April 6; see the information box.)

Some 925 children painted and sprayed, chiseled, rolled and spun art last summer at the association's annual ARTScool in its 585 Park Street building. Another 325 did the same at four outlying schools in a premiere ""ARTScool to You."" This year 500 children will learn art in five summer schools.

Adult learning now embraces 200 classes annually. They span cold-wax painting — creating ripples and bubbles in a finish — to pottery, blown glass, portrait painting, pastels and the artful slabs of palette knife technique.

Monthly and bimonthly exhibitions offer local art and juried works such as are in the current Florida Artists Group Annual Statewide Exhibition. Up next will be Camera USA, a local favorite that brings in a slew of outstanding works from around the U.S.

Art Hub session brings artists together, and exhibitor talks let the public hear what is on individual artists' minds and in their hearts. Dinner with the Artist pairs a chef and a working artist to share their processes and their personal stories to small dinner groups.

The organization celebrates 65 years of ""living the life"" in its annual ""For the Love of Art"" fundraiser Saturday, April 6. There's a Great Gatsby-Roaring Twenties theme, appropriate for an organization that plans to roar into its second 65 years.

Executive Director Aimee Schlehr is excited about its Ozlike message: All art on the building's exterior will be covered ""to represent a world without art,"" she said. But supporters will open the doors on a colorful festival of artists at work, music and food, representing Naples the way the association sees its potential.

Naples is a city for art

There's no organization required for artists to effuse about Southwest Florida as a place for creating art. But creating it well and making a career selling it is elusive. The Naples Art Association has hewed a clear path to opportunities since Schlehr became director 10 years ago.

""We have been trying to focus more on providing our local and regional artists the platform on which to exhibit and providing them the professional development they need to succeed as business people,"" she said.

""A lot of times people really don’t understand artists are business people. We provide them a platform, so they can build their career and move on. It's similar to a lawyer coming out of school, who needs to go into a big firm to get the experience before they move out on their own.""

The association has stepped up its monthly curated exhibitions of local art in the small side gallery, once the members' gallery, but now Gallery 104. For a $40 entry fee you can submit your art; if you're an Art Association donor, it's a $15 fee. And there are no promises, warned Jack O' Brien, curator for the association.

""People like a competition. You like being able to say 'I competed against my peers and won a spot,'"" he pointed out. And for those who lose, ""It forces you to analyze what you're doing.""

O'Brien's chief concern about the Naples Art Association galleries, which have three shows up at any given time is ""How do we let people know what we're doing when we're doing so much and so quickly?""

The quality and quantity is known well enough for its work with students, but the county is growing exponentially, and the Naples Art Association needs to reach all its population, Schlehr said.

Board President Robert Walpole echoes that: ""The big challenge for an organization like the Naples Art Association, is how we can expand a brand. Growing that brand to present opportunities to creative people requires knowledge of the brand.""

Aimee Schlehr, CEO and executive director of the Naples Art Association, poses for a portrait in her office in Naples on Wednesday, March 27, 2019. (Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Further, Schlehr acknowledged, cultivating sponsorships for its local art programs takes a lot more education itself:

""To get a sponsor to underwrite an exhibition for professional development, they really have to understand and appreciate what opportunities it's providing for these artists,"" she said.

With every success comes a challenge.

The Naples Art Center has filled its space is a subtlety. To reach Schlehr's office visitors walk through the center's kitchen. She shares it with the center's storage roo.

A set of shelves holds linens and utensils for receptions and for the evenings the center is rented out, one of its income-producing elements. Nestled against her desk are boxes of Nature Valley granola bars waiting on an arts festival

""This building wasn't built for storage,"" Schlehr said, chuckling. ""There's only so much a tri-fold will hide.""

She gave up a corner office on the other side of the building to enlarge its nine adjacent staff cubicles — so staff can store more of their own supplies in those.

With adult classes in the midst of their first season at the North Collier Regional Park, the center is also looking to launch them at the Eagle Lakes Community Park, too. It's a matter of getting the information to east and south Naples, Schlehr said.

ARTScool will take over the Girl Scout house next to its Park Street quarters and will probably max out its 1,010-student limit this year. In the association's dreams is a satellite office that can administer this growing number of off-campus classes.

O'Brien has created gallery space on every wall of its four rotundas that has enabled the center to share local exhibitions with art people might never see otherwise, such as the ""Andy Warhol Portfolios"" that brought a more thoughtful look at the pop artist's philosophy.

""The Photographic Landscape"" contrasted the black-and-white work of Florida's famous photographer, Clyde Butcher, with Western nature photographer T.K. Hill. And the Hewitt collection exhibition of African-American art brought some of its more famous names — Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, Elizabeth Catlett and former Naples resident Jonathan Green.

To bring some of the import of the exhibitions to viewers, he has begun ""Tea with the Curator"" to share perspectives on what's in the center. People may have to take the elevator to the second floor to see everything now. But O'Brien likes the fact that it takes people past the ongoing classes and through the library.

""It's a campus environment that you wouldn't discover if you didn't come up here,"" he explained.

Still, the center is making tentative steps for a capital campaign to find more space as well as to update its 20-year-old building, which is in need of resealed windows, updated bathrooms and a better showcase for its popular gift shop, which specializes in locally and regionally produced items.

""My dream would be to find office space for the staff, move the gift shop over to where the office staff and put a little coffee shop in there,"" Schlehr said.

""We don't want to open a restaurant. We don’t want to compete with our great partners who offer dining downtown. But we do have students who stay here all day. We do have peep who come through the building, and they love to sit on the back deck. Some coffee and Danish would be nice.""

That's still in the future, she added. This coming weekend, Naples Art Association plans to celebrate its first 65 years and look forward to the next 65, exemplifying Kahlo's exhortation to ""live the life.""

""The future is bright here,"" Schlehr said happily.

1230,K-9 Kilo saved in the line of duty thanks to 7-year-old with big heart,"ST. AUGUSTINE BEACH, Fla. - The outcome could have been devastating for a St. Augustine Beach Police K-9 and his handler. But, luckily crisis was averted -- thanks to a 7-year-old girl making sure police dogs are safe in the line of duty.

Last month, K-9 Kilo and his handler Cpl. Bruce Cline where on duty at VyStar in St. Augustine Beach. Kilo was taking a rest inside their police vehicle in the parking lot of the bank as Bruce worked his security detail inside.

The pair have been partners -- and inseparable -- for two years, vowing to serve and protect their community and each other.

""I was giving (Kilo) a break inside the vehicle, where he gets to kind of unwind and relax. I have a sensor that gives me feedback to my phone,"" Bruce explained to News4Jax anchor Joy Purdy. ""I monitor that temperature whenever (Kilo's) in the vehicle. I can see that that temperature was going up.""

What Bruce didn't know as he was looking at his phone, the air conditioner blowing cool air to Kilo malfunctioned, so the temperature inside the police vehicle was climbing.

He immediately went to Kilo, realized the AC wasn't working properly and brought his K9 partner back inside the bank with him for the rest of the day.

""I had the AC on and it malfunctioned. This is actually how the canines die in these cars, without these heat alarms,"" Bruce told Joy.

According to the Officer Down Memorial Page, 17 K-9s have died nationwide since 2016 as a result of heat exhaustion inside their handlers vehicles.

With the heat alarm and the app that goes with it, not only can Bruce monitor the temperature inside his police vehicle whenever he wants to check it, the app will also alert him when the vehicle's inside temperature exceeds the set limit.

He receives text alerts and automated phone calls, while other components of the total alarm system automatically turn on a cooling fan set up in one of the rear windows, and sets off the vehicle's horn and flashing lights.

""An alert is also sent to other people (designated) on my contact list,"" Bruce said.

That's the backup in case he's in a location where phone service is limited or if he were to miss an app alert.

""There's a huge misconception that (K-9 officers) are being cruel by leaving out dogs in there,"" Bruce told Joy while shaking his head. ""(Kilo) is always paying attention to movement and smells, so sometimes that's the only break that he gets, is to be in there.""

""I'm fortunate to be able to have one of these heat alarms installed in my vehicle,"" he added.

Bruce has the heat sensor because of 7-year-old Emma Johnson and her mom Debbie. The mother-daughter duo started the nonprofit K9s United to buy specific, life-saving supplies and tools that police K-9 units across the country need.

WATCH: How K9s United got started

It was from money raised during K9s United's annual charity run that allowed Emma and Debbie to purchase and donate the heat sensor that saved Kilo's life.

""So you're back at home with Kilo, you and Kilo hanging out, and you're thinking what just happened?"" Joy asked Bruce.

""The next day, afterwards, I kinda realized, I'm so blessed. I'm extremely fortunate,"" he answered. ""I would have been devastated. He's my buddy. This is my dream job.""

""Being a cop is one thing, but having a bond that we have and being able to work hand-in-hand with, it’s an absolute dream,"" Bruce added.

Bruce says right after the donated heat sensor saved the day, he let everyone know.

""When I got the text, my heart sank at first, and then it was, like, 'Oh, but (Kilo's) okay!"" said Debbie.

Joy asked Emma if she understands exactly how she helped protect Kilo. The soft-spoken girl smiled and nodded her head, ""Yes.""

Joy then asked how it makes her feel, and she summed it up perfectly in one word:

""Happy!"" Emma exclaimed.

""I remember the text I got from Corporal Cline like it was yesterday,"" St. Augustine Beach Police Chief Robert Chadwick said to Joy. ""This is his life, this is his family member -- and one of ours -- so we had an actual save, based on adding these extra features.""

Debbie says with proof a car heat alarm can save a K9's life, she and Emma have a new focus for their mission -- raising money to specifically buy heat alarms for law enforcement canines locally and nationwide. You can donate specifically to the campaign to help equip K9 units with heat alarms on the charity's website at K9sUnited.org.

Kilo is a community superstar

K-9 Kilo joined the St. Augustine Beach Police Department two years ago as an expert at detecting drugs and finding missing people.

The 4-year-old German Shepherd is not only an important asset on the force, he's actually kind of a superstar with members of the community.

Posts on Facebook about the four-legged officer have reached more than 21,000 people. One particular post involving Kilo and boxes of Girl Scout Cookies received more than 650 likes (and that number keeps going up).

""He's become a community partner,"" Chief Hardwick told Joy. ""He's become truly a focal point of our agency.""

1232,Police officer accused of sex with child held on $1 million bond,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Veteran police Officer Matthew Butler wore a red jumpsuit Wednesday when he faced a judge for the first time on a charge of capital sexual battery on a child under 12. He was ordered held on $1 million bond pending an arraignment April 17.

The nine-year veteran officer was arrested Tuesday The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office began investigating the 39-year-old officer last Friday after getting a tip he was in possession of an inappropriate photo of a young girl on a digital device.

Police haven't said Butler’s relationship to the victim and said they are checking all of Butler’s electronic devices to see if there could be any more victims.

News4Jax has requested the arrest warrant that should provide more details of the accusations.

He was booked into the Duval County jail just after 6 p.m. Tuesday. Jail inmates dressed in red are considered either high-profile prisoners, an escape risk or a suicide risk.

The person who answered the door at Butler's listed address Tuesday night did not wish to comment. A neighbor described his arrest as surreal.

""It's just the biggest shock to me of anything I’ve ever heard,"" neighbor Donald Johnson said.

Undersheriff Pat Ivey said the JSO was taking the unusual step of releasing an employee's booking photo due to the nature of the crime. Ivey said JSO would begin the process of firing the 39-year-old officer, but because he is a civil service employee, they have to go through a process for that to happen.

Police said it believes the Florida Department of Children and Families is involved in the case. DCF has not returned a request for comment.

Butler's arrest comes four days after the arrest of a veteran police officer. Rodney Bryant, 32, was charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

According to the Sheriff's Office, Bryant was arrested after an argument with his girlfriend and another woman that began at a Southside gentlemen's club. As they drove away, police said Bryant pulled over, retrieved a gun from the trunk of the car and pointed the firearm at the women.

1233,Former DoD employee sentenced to 10 years in child enticement case,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A former Department of Defense employee was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty last year to federal charges that he tried to entice a child into meeting for sex, authorities said.

Mohammad Abdul Malek, 68, of St. Marys, Georgia, pleaded guilty Oct. 30 to a count of attempted enticement and coercion of a minor, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Florida’s Middle District.

According to his plea agreement, Malek exchanged emails and texts with someone he thought was a 13-year-old girl in August. He asked for photos and said he wanted to teach her about “making love.”

In reality, the person he was communicating with was an undercover detective. When Malek traveled to Jacksonville to meet up with the “child” Aug. 26, he was arrested by the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide campaign by the Justice Department aimed at curbing the spread of child sexual exploitation and abuse.

Jolana Alexandre, 27, and Makenson Alexandre, 34, were arrested Saturday.

Believed to be around 2 years old, the girl was found alone in Haverhill Park. Deputies searched for a parent or a guardian in the surrounding area, but found no one. Deputies also checked with 911 dispatchers and found that no one had reported the girl missing.

More than 14 hours later, one of her parents contacted authorities to claim her. The Florida Department of Children and Families is currently caring for the girl. The department also removed the couple's other seven children from the home.

The Alexandres told deputies that they did not realize they left the girl at the park.

1246,Disney's 'Frozen' at Hertz Arena: Snow comes to Southwest Florida for ice-skating show,"CLOSE After ""Frozen"" hit theaters in 2013, it quickly became an instant classic, delighting not only diehard Disney fans but also casual moviegoers, before going on to become the highest-grossing animated movie of all time. And on Tuesday, the studio officially announced the release date for the long-anticipated sequel. Expectant fans can mark their calendars, as Elsa and Anna will be making their return to the silver screen on November 29th of 2019. While many of the details remain secret for the time being, it seems as if most of the original Frozen original cast members are expected to return, including Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad, as well as directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck.

Even in sunny Florida, it snows whenever Elsa works her magic. This is “Frozen,” after all.

“Fort Myers is warm right now, but we’ll see what happens when Elsa gets there,” says skater/actor Morgan Bell, who plays Elsa’s sister Anna in the Disney ice-skating show. “She’ll make it snow.”

Not just a little snow, either. We’re talking a full-on snow storm in Hertz Arena — courtesy of an army of snow machines scattered around the venue. It’s the real deal: Cold, wet and everywhere.

Many Southwest Florida audiences, of course, have never seen snow before — real or man-made. And kids lose their minds when they see the stuff, Bell says.

“To see the audience get excited about that is pretty cool,” she says. “They’re always reaching out and feeling it.”

That’s not the only jaw-dropping spectacle audiences will see when “Disney On Ice presents Frozen” visits Estero this weekend. There’s the fearsome snow monster Marshmallow, for example. And an ice castle. And lots of Elsa’s powerful winter magic.

Except for the snow machines, though, Bell won’t discuss how all those things come to life. That’d ruin it for the kids.

“It’s all part of the Disney magic,” she says.

But here’s what she WILL say about the popular touring show: It’s exciting and fun and sticks closely to the story from the 2013 movie hit “Frozen.” All the songs are there, including “Let It Go” and “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?”

And so are all the popular characters: Royal sisters Anna and Elsa, loveable snowman Olaf, rugged mountain man Kristoff, the reindeer Sven and even that fearsome ice monster (his name is Marshmallow).

“It was kind of a dream to play Anna on this show,” Bell says. “It’s a really amazing story, and it’s been a lot of fun for me.”

Bell remembers seeing the movie with her cousin when it first came out. She especially loved Anna — a character who was miles away from the typical Disney princess.

“Anna is so unique,” Bell says. “She’s relatable to a lot of people. She’s quirky and little bit unorthodox, and to bring that out on the ice has been a lot of fun.”

Bell loves seeing kids show up for the ice-skating show in costume and scream out characters’ names when they appear: “Anna!” “Elsa!” “Olaf!” “Kristoff!”

“To see little girls dressed as Anna and Elsa in the audience and to know you’re helping families make memories is pretty special,” Bell says.

She especially loves the show’s underlying message about sisterhood and the importance of family.

“For little girls, it’s a great message, really” Bell says. “The focus is more on family love versus a girl needing a man to come and save her. It’s more focused on that love between sisters and that bond and how important it is.”

Tickets for “Disney on Ice presents Frozen” are $15-$100 (plus $20 for parking).

Hertz Arena is located 11000 Everblades Parkway in Estero, just off the intersection of I-75 and Corkscrew Road. For more information, call 948-7825 or visit hertzarena.com.

1252,FSU website alerts to autism signs,"Your baby delights you but he’s causing you concern. Why is it so hard to get him to look at you? Why doesn’t he gesture as much as other babies you know?

Your relatives say you worry too much. They blame your parenting for the child’s frequent tantrums. Still, you wonder: “Could my baby have autism? And why isn’t there an easier way to find out?”

Amy Wetherby, one of the country’s pioneers in Autism Spectrum Disorder research, regularly hears those questions, and she has been working for decades to provide reliable, user-friendly tools for parents. This week, she and her team at the Florida State University College of Medicine’s Autism Institute are unveiling their latest breakthrough - Baby Navigator.

Early diagnosis and intervention are critical to help children with autism reach their potential. Parents can start interventions right away at home to support the growth of their child’s social communication skills.

“This is a culmination of our research,” said Wetherby, distinguished research professor and director of the institute. “Now what we really want to do is disseminate what we’ve learned.

“Baby Navigator is for parents to easily access the online resources that we’ve developed. Baby Navigator has two purposes: to provide information on early development and to provide information about early signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder.”

Hardly anyone — often not even the family pediatrician — wants to be the one to raise the possibility of a child’s developmental delay or disorder. Parents need to know the signs.

“It’s been more than a decade since the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended screening all children for autism at 18 and 24 months,” Wetherby said. “But the reality is very few doctors do that. And the screening tool that’s widely used is not very accurate at younger ages.”

Baby Navigator reflects the National Institutes of Health-funded research that Wetherby’s team has done on early detection of autism. It also incorporates the online courses and tools developed with funding from the Florida Legislature. And thanks to an anonymous donor, much of that information is becoming available on various PBS stations. Parents can access photo illustrations, video clips and a screening tool for children 9-18 months of age, and register for parenting classes, all online for free.

Wetherby’s favorite part of Baby Navigator is the new Autism Navigator Lookbook — 16 Early Signs of Autism by 16 Months. It’s loaded with photos so everyone can see what to look for in toddlers.

“We’re trying to lead the nation,” she said. “We have new milestones we want to teach everybody that are much more precise. They’re about social communication growth. We have pictures. We have videos. We’ve taken our growth charts down to six months.

“Way before they’re learning to read, they’re learning to communicate. That’s the foundation. Our goal is for most or all children with autism to have enough skills to thrive in general education kindergarten. It’s cost-saving and is the best learning environment. From there, they have a much better chance of graduating from high school and getting a job or going to college.”

The research at the FSU Autism Institute is reaching families, doctors and medical students across Florida and beyond. Laura Iyampillai in West Palm Beach has seen Wetherby’s tools work miracles.

Early on, she noticed her daughter didn’t communicate like other babies. In addition, she could barely take her out of the house without a meltdown. Onlookers blamed her parenting skills. Even though her pediatrician listened to her and referred her very early for intervention, the intervention system was not prepared. The interventionist ignored all of Iyampillai’s observations and said day care and $100-an-hour consultants would solve the problems.

But her speech-language-pathologist friend had heard of Wetherby. Finally, in desperation, Iyampillai sent Wetherby an emotional email, just in time to screen her daughter by 18 months and be in their research.

“They started the intervention right away,” Iyampillai said. “It was amazing.”

That was three years ago. Now her daughter is four-and-one-half.

“By her second birthday she was a completely new child,” Iyampillai said. “Even within the first few weeks, she started to communicate for the first time ever. Once she could communicate, we were able to leave the house. She wasn’t having meltdowns anymore. By her second birthday, she was the easiest, most charming little girl.”

It was all done with long-distance video coaching. The Autism Institute experts would watch the parents interact with their child. In effect, they trained the parents to be the interventionists.

Third-year College of Medicine student Evan Schrader worked on research at the FSU Autism Institute and is helping to spread the word in the Orlando area. He led a research project with the patients of one of his faculty members, Alix Casler, chair of the pediatrics department in the Orlando Health hospital system.

The Autism Institute’s new screening tool is performing so much better than the previous tool used by Casler and two partners that they are now using it exclusively — and “our goal is to have her whole group use it by the time I graduate in 2020,” Schrader said. According to his research project, the average age of detection with the new screener was 1.6 years, roughly twice as early as the 3.1 years with the previous tool.

If autism can be caught early, Wetherby said, the outcomes can be promising.

“If we can prevent the challenging behavior so they can learn to communicate and talk and thrive in school, and still have autism, that’s a good outcome,” she said. “The cost for one child with autism can range from $1 million to $2.4 million over a lifetime. And a lot of that is adult care that we can prevent. I want kids with autism to grow up and be employed.”

Though Wetherby is soft-spoken, her voice rises impatiently when she considers the unnecessary toll that autism is taking on our children.

“Think about any other condition, like childhood leukemia,” she said. “Imagine if I said to you, ‘Average age of diagnosis is 4 years, but we know how to detect it by 1½.’ That would be alarming. Why is it not alarming that we’re not picking up autism earlier? By teaching children to communicate earlier, you can prevent a lot of the consequences and promote brain development.”

1254,"TSO plays 'Seven Last Words,' Beethoven's 9th in evening of beauty, pain | Music roundup","Buy Photo Tallahassee Symphony Orchestra premieres ""Seven Last Words"" on Sunday. (Photo: Democrat files)

Ten months before he died, Leonard Bernstein conducted one of the most moving performances of his life — a special Berlin Celebration Concert in what was formerly East Berlin featuring a multi-national orchestra and chorus performing Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall.

I watched a video of that concert on YouTube recently. It took place Christmas Day 1989 and Bernstein is not at the top of his game. He’s paunchy and moves stiffly at first — the fire of his youthful and passionate presence on the podium banked by age and infirmity. But you can see him warm to the orchestra and the music as the performance spools out and he gets caught up in the magic and emotion of Beethoven’s monumental masterwork.

There’s a moment where you can actually see Bernstein becoming Lenny, the young maestro who conducts with his soul as much as with his mind and body. After the second movement concludes, just before the exquisite, lyrical Adagio section, he stands on the podium facing the orchestra, which awaits his cue. Eyes closed, brow furrowed, it’s as if he is at prayer or is gathering the strength for a great task.

And then he opens his eyes and cues the the start of that gorgeous Adagio molto e cantabile with his big, blunt hands. And by the time he gets to the final, magnificent movement — the “furioso” and choral finale — you can see him singing along, fully engaged and transported by the music. Oh, and he’s leading the players and singers through the Ninth without notes or score before him.

By the end, Bernstein seems exalted — smiling, grimacing, even leaping on the podium. And after the last note fades, Lenny stands again with his eyes closed, his face lifted, his body still thrumming with the music.

It’s not the best performance of the Ninth, but it’s one that embodies the symphony’s power to move not only the audience, but the players, the singers and the conductor. For the occasion, Bernstein with tinkered the paean to brotherhood and unity by Schiller that Beethoven set to music for the choral finale — he changed the word “freude,” or “joy,” to “freiheit,” or “freedom.”

In this age of snark and spite and short attention spans, it is probably unfashionable and even naive to adore the Ninth. But oh, how I do adore it! I love it as a sublime piece of musical genius, crafted by a beloved composer who was nearly stone deaf when he wrote it. It is the final complete symphony by Beethoven, and it is a perfect piece of music throughout.

The Democrat has already written about this weekend’s Tallahassee Symphony Orchestra doubleheader, first in an excellent story by Nada Hassanein on Joel Thompson’s composition “Seven Last Words of the Unarmed,” which will lead off the TSO’s performance Sunday afternoon in Ruby Diamond Concert Hall with special choral guests the Morehouse College Glee Club and FAMU Concert Choir.

There was also an article inviting students to attend an open rehearsal of the piece, and an op-ed column by Jessica Langois on how Thompson’s composition is a call for “radical empathy.”

It will be a powerful and powerfully moving concert, and attendees will be well advised to bring hankies — for such music opens the heart and makes it overflow.

And if concertgoers aren’t wrung out after the first half of Sunday’s program, the second half ought to finish them off. The TSO is ending the concert with the Ninth Symphony, which will be the featured work on Saturday night’s program as well.

The TSO and guest choruses perform the Ninth Symphony at 8 p.m. Saturday in Ruby Diamond Concert Hall. Tickets range from $25 to $52. The TSO and choral groups also perform “Ode to Understanding,” a concert featuring Joel Thompson’s “Seven Last Words of the Unarmed,” as well as Beethoven’s Ninth, at 3:30 p.m. Sunday in Ruby Diamond. Tickets range from $20 to $60. Visit www.tallahasseesymphony.org.

1258,Venezuelan family facing deportation granted extension,"- A Venezuelan family facing deportation will be able to stay in Tampa for at least one more year.

Jennifer Infante, her husband, and their two children, went before immigration authorities Tuesday in a last-ditch effort to avoid going back to Venezuela.



""Our lives were in danger,"" said Infante, who has worked tirelessly to keep her family together.

The couple's daughter, Madison, was born in the United States, and is therefore a U.S. citizen. But with strict orders to go back to their country, the family was worried they would be separated from their daughter.



However, ICE officials granted the family a one-year extension.

""They have to take into account what's going to happen to the U.S. citizen if the family gets deported,"" said Paul Palacios, an immigration attorney for Migrants Foundation.

According to Palacios, immigration authorities likely weighed multiple factors specific to this family's case, including Venezuela's current political and social turmoil.

Infante says her family came to Florida five years ago after receiving death threats in their hometown of Maracaibo, the capital of the state of Valencia. Her husband, William Paredes, served as a K9 officer and said he refused to give into corruption.



Shortly after arriving to Florida on tourist visas, Infante and Paredes applied for asylum. The request was denied, but as their case played out, they welcomed a baby girl.



The couple says returning to Venezuela at this time would be a nightmare. With long power outages, limited food, medicine, skyrocketing inflation and crime rates, Infante says surviving would be a struggle.

The family's attorney, Paul Palacios, contacted Sen. Rick Scott and Sen. Marco Rubio for assistance in this case. Palacios said it definitely helped.

Though the family only has one more year to stay in the United States legally, they hope Congress passes a bill that would grant Venezuelans temporary protective status. Several U.S. senators, like Rubio and Scott, have expressed their support, but President Trump has not said whether he will sign off on it.



""We will continue to fight,"" said Infante, who vows she will do everything to keep her family safe.

BARRON, Wis. (AP) - A Wisconsin man pleaded guilty Wednesday to kidnapping 13-year-old Jayme Closs, killing her parents and holding her captive in a remote cabin for three months.

Jake Patterson, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of intentional homicide and one count of kidnapping. A count of armed burglary was dropped. The intentional homicide counts carry a sentence of life in prison.

Patterson had said he would plead guilty in a letter sent earlier this month to a Minneapolis TV station, saying he didn’t want the Closs family “to worry about a trial.”

Patterson admitted kidnapping Jayme after killing her parents, James and Denise Closs, on Oct. 15 at the family’s home near Barron, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northeast of Minneapolis. Jayme escaped in January, after 88 days in Patterson’s cabin in near the small, isolated town of Gordon, some 60 miles (97 kilometers) from her home.

According to a criminal complaint , Patterson told authorities he decided Jayme “was the girl he was going to take” after he saw her getting on a school bus near her home.

Jayme told police that the night of the abduction, the family dog’s barking awoke her, and she went to wake up her parents as a car came up the driveway. While her father went to the front door, Jayme and her mother hid in the bathroom, clutching each other in the bathtub, with the shower curtain pulled shut.

They heard Jayme’s father get shot. Patterson then found Jayme and her mother. He told detectives he wrapped tape around Jayme’s mouth and head, taped her hands behind her back and taped her ankles together, then shot her mother in the head. He told police he dragged Jayme outside, threw her in the trunk of his car, and took her to his cabin, the complaint said.

During Jayme’s time in captivity, Patterson forced her to hide under a bed when he had friends over and penned her in with tote boxes and weights, warning that if she moved, “bad things could happen to her.” He also turned up the radio so visitors couldn’t hear her, according to the complaint.

Authorities searched for Jayme for months and collected more than 3,500 tips. On Jan. 10, Jayme escaped from the cabin while Patterson was away. She then flagged down a woman who was out walking a dog and pleaded for help. Patterson was arrested minutes later.",http://www.wfla.com/national/man-pleads-guilty-to-kidnapping-jayme-closs-killing-her-parents/1880829830,2019-03-27T18:19:18Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1262,Local student moves forward with device designed to stop speeding near buses,"ASTATULA, Fla. - News 6 first introduced viewers to Astatula Elementary student Julia Dumont two weeks ago when she had had just won the Lake County Regional Science Fair with an invention designed to keep students safe while getting on and off the school bus.

When News 6 traffic safety expert Trooper Steve Montiero saw Julia's ""Magic School Bus"" project, he knew he just had to meet the 10-year-old girl.

Julia visited Montiero at the News 6 studios. She brought along her prototype, a 7-foot PVC pipe, equipped with yellow reflective tape and flashing LED lights.

""This is the most impressive thing I've ever seen from a grade school student,"" Montiero said. ""The idea is 100 percent spot on. The concept is genius and what I get excited about is your intent behind it. You're just truly trying to help people and save lives.""

Montiero presented Julia a certificate of appreciation for her safety innovation.

""It feels really good to know that someone who actually deals with traffic is helping me, trying to push me forward,"" she said.

Julia said her next step is appearing before the Lake County School Board to ask members to put the bar on buses, and Montiero said he'd love to go along with her.

""Looking at this, I would go with you, because this is something I feel would legitimately reduce crashes almost immediately and save students from being hit,"" Montiero said.

The Cape Coral Police Department released new details Tuesday in the investigation of an 8-year-old girl who was killed Monday morning while waiting at her school bus stop.

Police said they seized the red pickup they believe was involved in the fatal hit-and-run as evidence, and they have developed a person of interest in the case. Police are not releasing details about the person's identity ""as the investigation is still in its infancy,"" a news release said.

Police said the truck was traveling south on NE 3rd Avenue approaching NE 19th Terrace while Layla Aiken was sitting on the edge of the roadway on the northeast corner, waiting for her school bus.

""For an unknown reason,"" the truck made a sharp left turn traveling eastbound on NE 19th Terrace before the front of the truck struck and rolled over Layla, police said. The truck left the scene eastbound on 19th Terrace toward Andalusia Boulevard ""without rendering aid or providing information.""

Layla was taken to the hospital, where she died Monday. Police responded to the crash at about 6:20 a.m.

""The lead investigator and other Cape Coral Police personnel are working diligently to resolve this tragic case with the correct disposition based on the totality of the investigation as soon as possible,"" the news release said. The Police Department is also working with the state attorney's office on the investigation.

According to city data, there are no sidewalks on or near the road where Layla was hit.

Assistant City Manager Connie Barron said via email that the city generally limits the installation of sidewalks to major roadway arterials and collector streets. But the city has added sidewalks to local streets that serve as a ""pass through"" for cars going from one major road to another. For example, SE 8th Street from Cultural Park to Santa Barbara.

Barron said there was a streetlight at the intersection of the accident, and that the city's priority for streetlight installations was bus stops.

Amber Rollins, the director of KidsAndCars.org in Kansas, said it is important for parents to start talking to their children about traffic safety at a young age. She also said that schools should reinforce the messages.

""I have a 2-year-old, and we talk about how cars are dangerous and looking both ways before you cross the street,"" she said. ""I know that he doesn't comprehend it, but we still talk about it. You want to kind of get that ingrained in them from a very, very early age.''

KidsAndCars.org has a long list of tips for students and drivers on its website that are related to school bus safety. One of the organization's recommendations fis for children to stand five giant steps away from the road while waiting on a school bus.

""You want to talk to your kids about where is the safest place to stand,"" Rollins said. ""Talking to your children about how just because they can see the car doesn't mean the car can see them is really important.""

A Lee County school district safety team inspected the bus stop after Monday's crash.

""They just go back to review the stop to make sure that nothing has changed since it was last inspected or selected and to make sure it meets all the requirements to be considered a safe stop,"" school district spokesman Rob Spicker said. ""That was the determination that was made.""

1266,Navy lieutenant gets 10 years for using internet to seek sex with child,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Mayport Navy lieutenant was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for using the internet to attempt to entice a child to engage in sexual activity, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida announced Monday.

Michael Douglas McNeil was also ordered to serve a five-year term of supervised release and to register as a sex offender.

McNeil has been detained since his Aug. 30 arrest, which the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said was part of Operation DUVAL, standing for Disrupting Underage Virtual Abuse Locally. JSO detectives teamed with nearly a dozen other law enforcement agencies in the trolling sting.

According to court documents, on Aug. 27, a detective with the Clay County Sheriff’s Office, who was posing online as a family member of a 12-year-old handicapped child, received a message on a social media app from McNeil, who identified himself as “Mark.”

Prosecutors said McNeil expressed interested in having sex with the “child” and was told that the “child” was 12 years old.

Over a four-day period, according to authorities, McNeil and the undercover detective discussed plans for McNeil to meet the “child” for sex and McNeil asked for several photos of the “child,” sent the undercover detective an explicit photo of himself, and asked specific questions about the “child’s” sexual experience and abilities.

McNeil was arrested when he arrived at a Starbucks in Orange Park, where he thought he was going to meet the girl, authorities said.

During an interview, McNeil admitted, among other things, that he showed up to meet the “child” because of his “curiosity” about “a younger girl,"" according to the DOJ.

The case was investigated by the Clay County Sheriff’s Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

It is another case brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse.

PINELLAS COUNTY, FL - (WFLA) - Opening arguments are expected to begin Monday in a high-profile murder trial in Pinellas County after years of delay.

For the first time, a jury will see evidence centered on John Jonchuck. He's the man accused of dropping his little girl to her death off of the Dick Misner Bridge near the Sunshine Skyway.

5-year-old Phoebe was killed four years ago and now a jury, which was seated Friday will begin hearing evidence that will ultimately lead to a decision on her father’s fate.

The jury is comprised of nine men and seven women. The trial is expected to last up to four weeks.

Jonchuck was being treated at a mental health facility up until recently. The judge warned the jury that he is medicated and they must not let his present condition in court or side effects from the medications affect their decision making process.

If found guilty, he could get life in prison, but if the jury decides he's innocent, he'll stay in a mental institution.

State prosecutors will not seek death penalty in this case.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/opening-arguments-to-begin-in-murder-trial-of-father-of-slain-girl/1875162112,2019-03-25T13:08:35Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

1282,Former Winter Haven man charged with 'horrific' sexual battery on young children,"Winter Haven Public Safety Director Charlie Bird: ""The path of emotional and physical destruction he caused is reprehensible and we will do everything within our power to make sure he will never be able to hurt another child again.""

WINTER HAVEN — After a four-month investigation that started in Winter Haven and ended in Knoxville, Tennessee, a 37-year-old man was arrested for sexual battery on a child under the age of 12.

Winter Haven Police Department arrested Manuel Tavis McGhee, charging him with two counts of sexual battery on a child under the age of 12; charges, they say, stem from repeated sex abuse on two children when McGhee lived in Winter Haven.

The mother of one of the victims, identified as Victim A, notified police in late 2018 that her daughter told her she had been abused by McGhee.

In an interview with investigators, the 15-year-old said she had been abused from age 5 to 11, according to the police.

The girl revealed ""extremely horrific and explicit details of the abuse she incurred from the age of five,"" according to a forensic interview with police.

Additionally, she told investigators her brother, identified as Victim B, who is a couple of years older, had endured the same type of abuse during those same years.

In 2013, two separate reports about McGhee were made to the Lakeland Police Department, involving Victim B and two other alleged victims in Lakeland that year. Both incidents were reported and investigated but formal charges were ultimately dropped, according to the WHPD investigation. During those Lakeland investigations, officers then had reported that McGhee said he had been accused of similar acts in 2006 while stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina with the U.S. Army.

In that case, McGhee had been charged with 15 counts of sexual battery on a child but the case was ultimately dropped by the U.S. Army, which had requested to prosecute the case instead of local authorities, ""due to a lack of evidence and McGhee's denial of all allegations,"" WHPD spokeswoman Jamie Brown said in a press release.

""The incidents were very similar to the incidents that occurred in the Winter Haven case,"" she added.

Based on McGhee's history of allegations, Victim A and Victim B were interviewed in December.

Victim B said the abuse started when he was 8 or 9 years old in North Carolina. The description of the abuse mirrored what Victim A reported, noted Brown.

Victim B also told police that the abuse continued in Lakeland and Winter Haven.

Regarding the 2013 allegation by Victim B, he told investigators recently he was afraid of what McGhee would do to him if he shared details. But by the time Victim B spoke to Winter Haven police, Victim B disclosed the details because McGhee had moved away and he said he didn't feel threatened any more.

WHPD detectives followed the North Carolina allegations and met with a Georgia woman identified as a victim in those reports.

This woman said that when she was nine years old McGhee had abused her, and the pattern was identical to the other victims that were interviewed, according to WHPD reports.

A sibling of this victim also detailed abuse in a separate interview with Winter Haven detectives, according to a WHPD media release.

Based on the totality of the statements made by numerous victims across multiple agencies, Winter Haven detectives obtained a warrant to arrest McGhee. He was taken into custody in Knoxville and is awaiting extradition back to Florida.

""I can say one thing — that I am so proud of our detectives and their tenacity to ensure that there are no more children that this monster can hurt,"" said Winter Haven Public Safety Director Charlie Bird. ""The path of emotional and physical destruction he caused is reprehensible and we will do everything within our power to make sure he will never be able to hurt another child again.""

1283,Mental health and suicide prevention town hall held in Coral Springs,"The Parkland and Coral Springs communities came together to turn their suffering and grieving to hope and healing.

A mental health and suicide prevention town hall was held inside Coral Springs City Hall Wednesday evening.

The goal was to educate parents on how they can help their children who may be suffering in silence.

“It’s been difficult, but it has been getting better,” mother Melissa Blank said.

Her son, Jonathan Blank, was inside Building 12 when a gunman opened fire, killing two classmates and injuring others inside his classroom on Valentine’s Day last year.

“We need to be more proactive,"" Blank said. ""Teachers are going through training and I’d like it to be spread out to the communities.”

Blank joined other parents in a crowded room to ask mental health experts questions about the resources that are available for their children.

Cindy Arenberg Seltzer of Children’s Services Council of Broward County broke down some sample questions loved ones should ask their child, especially the young people who survived and suffered after last year’s tragedy in Parkland.

Have you thought about hurting yourself? Have you done anything to forward that desire?

“It’s important for people to understand that all of these emotions that they’re going through are natural and normal, and that they are not alone,” Arenberg Seltzer said.

The town hall comes after two Parkland survivors and a father of a little girl who was murdered in the Sandy Hook massacre took their own lives, all within days of each other.

“It opens up some more wounds with our community. Everybody is really stepping up, we want to prevent any further tragedy that’s stems from our incident here,” said Sgt. Carla Kmiotek with Coral Springs Police.

Some parents of the shooting victims like Broward school board member Lori Alhadeff and Max Schachter attended the event.

A city leader tells CBS12 News there is a plan in place to help Stoneman Douglas students cope when they return to school Monday.

If you are in a crisis, call the toll-free National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-80-273-TALK (8255) for immediate help, or dial 211 to connect to an expert. They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1286,'She was my daughter': Jury in Jonchuck murder trial watches interrogation room video,"'She was my daughter': Jury in Jonchuck murder trial watches interrogation room video Video Video

PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - Day two of the high-profile John Jonchuck murder trial is underway in Pinellas County.

Jonchuck is the man accused of dropping his 5-year-old daughter Phoebe to her death off the Dick Misener Bridge near the Sunshine Skyway in St. Petersburg four years ago.

The trial was delayed several years, but a jury comprised of nine men and seven women was seated Friday.

State prosecutors say they will not seek the death penalty in this case. If found guilty, Jonchuck could serve life in prison. If the jury finds him innocent, he'll stay in a mental institution.

On Monday, the jurors heard opening statements from prosecution and defense teams.

DAY 2 UPDATES:

On day two of the trial, the jury first heard testimony from three additional officers who were involved with the investigation into Phoebe's death. During that testimony, jurors saw the large Swedish Bible that officers say Jonchuck had on him the night Phoebe died. Officer shows Bible from night Phoebe...

After that testimony concluded, prosecutors started showing video of Jonchuck in the interrogation room after being taken into custody back in 2015. Much of the interrogation room video shown so far features Jonchuck sitting by himself waiting to be questioned.

At one point, Jonchuck starts talking to the authorities in the room about a conspiracy and ""something bigger going on"" that's ""beyond me, beyond everything.""

Jonchuck: 'I think there's something...

""It's almost like - I'm not being weird - this is like a conspiracy. I went looking for answers, I've always had problems growing up like wondering who I was and what my purpose was,"" he said.

In the video, Jonchuck also talks about going to a church and speaking with ""Father Bill."" Jonchuck told a detective in the room that the father said he ""wasn't going to be ready this Easter but next Easter"" and that, ""I was the pope.""

Jonchuck talks about 'conspiracy'

After almost an hour of being in the interrogation room, Jonchuck asks about his daughter.

""Is Phoebe OK?"" he asks the detective sitting with him.

The detective responds asking who Phoebe is. After a long pause with his head in his hand, Jonchuck responds, ""Phoebe was my daughter.""

Jonchuck: 'Is Phoebe OK?'

Judge Chris Helinger called the prosecutors and defense attorneys to her bench after watching about an hour of the interrogation room video. Judge Helinger decided to call for a lunch break, putting court in recess until 2 p.m.

When court resumed, the jury watched the rest of the interrogation room video before attorneys cross-examined a detective and a former Hillsborough County deputy.

Jonchuck's mother Michele then took the stand and got emotional talking about her granddaughter Phoebe, who she referred to as her ""princess angel.""

Jonchuck's mom takes the stand

Jonchuck's mother was excused after giving testimony about swim lessons for Phoebe and who was caring for the girl.

Prosecutors then called Sgt. Kenny Miller to the stand. Miller was assigned as the lead detective on the case involving Phoebe's death. While on the stand, Sgt. Miller described getting to the scene around 1:20 a.m. Jan. 8, 2015 and seeing crews searching for Phoebe.

Miller testified that the girl's body was found just after 1:30 a.m.

""The boats were coming in and I saw Phoebe come off one of the rescue boats and they were performing CPR on her,"" Miller said. ""She was wet, she had what looked like pajamas on. And she looked very pale.""

Miller said he did not see any signs of life and did not see Phoebe breathing.

Sgt. Miller testifies about getting...

While Sgt. Miller remained on the stand, attorneys continued to show the video of Jonchuck in the interrogation room after being taken into custody. At one point, Jonchuck asks where the detective is who is supposed to question him. He then comments, ""I just want to go to bed, I don't want to talk to anybody.""

Jonchuck: 'I just want to go to bed'

Shortly after Jonchuck makes that comment, the video shows Sgt. Miller walk into the interrogation room. He then begins questioning Jonchuck about what happened for about eight minutes.

DAY 1 RECAP:

The prosecution's opening statement lasted more than an hour. During that time, attorney Paul Bolan walked the jury through the events that took place at the Dick Misener Bridge just after midnight on Jan. 8, 2015.

Interrogation room video: Sgt. Miller...

Bolan also addressed the defense's argument that Jonchuck was insane at the time of his daughter's death.

""The defense will argue that the defendant was insane at the time that he committed this murder. And I want you to keep in mind that the defense has to establish that by clear and convincing evidence,"" he said. ""You've been read a jury instruction for insanity but I'm going to read it to you again because it's important and we need to consider it. And we need to consider carefully what these words say. A person is considered to be insane when he had a mental infirmity, disease or defect. But the analysis does not stop there. Someone is not insane just because they have mental illness, just because there's something wrong with them or they may say things that sound strange.""

Prosecutor addresses mental illness...

The defense team also walked through the events of the night of Phoebe's death, talking about Jonchuck's actions before, during and after his daughter's death. Attorney Jessica Manuele did not deny that Jonchuck dropped his daughter off the bridge, but called it an act of insanity.

""What happened just after midnight (that night) was tragic. That night, John Jonchuck Jr. took his daughter, whom he loved more than anybody in the world and dropped her over the side of the Dick Misener Bridge,"" Manuele said. ""It didn't make sense at the time, it doesn't make sense today. It will never make sense because it is insanity.""

Defense begins opening statement

Manuele told jurors that Jonchuck got out of his car on the bridge holding a large Swedish Bible, then got his daughter Phoebe out and dropped her off the bridge. She argued that Jonchuck was calm and did not hurry away, despite a St. Petersburg police officer witnessing what happened.

Defense gives statements on night of...

The defense team also urged jurors to focus heavily on the evidence without letting emotion get in the way.

""Nobody is disputing that what happened that night was tragic. But if you feel that your heartstrings are being intentionally tugged on, pay attention to that,"" she said. ""We have to focus on the evidence.""

After opening statements wrapped up, two witnesses were called to the stand. The first was St. Petersburg Police Officer William Vickers. Vickers is the officer who was on the Dick Misener Bridge when Phoebe was dropped.

Officer William Vicker recalls night...

In his testimony, Officer Vickers talked about his actions after Phoebe was dropped.

""I was immediately concerned for the child. I advised radio of what had happened. I was shocked but my immediate concern was the health, welfare and safety of the child,"" he said.

Vickers also described hearing a ""faint scream and a splash"" after Phoebe was dropped from the bridge. The officer says he then climbed down a nearby service ladder to try and search for the child.

""It was in the 40s, low 40s. The winds were gusting over 20 miles an hour. At a couple points, I was nearly blown off the bumper walkway area at the bottom of the bridge,"" he said, adding that the water was rough, dark and cold.

""I continued to call until a fire rescue boat arrived in the area. At that point, I got on to assist in searching and coordinating between police and fire resources,"" Vickers said. ""I looked at my watch a couple of times thinking 'we gotta find her, we gotta find her.'""

'We gotta find her': Officer...

The second witness called to the stand was a toll collector who gave a brief testimony about what he saw the night Phoebe died.

After the first two witnesses finished testifying, the judge ended court for the day and instructed jurors not to listen to, watch or talk about anything related to the trial.",https://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/watch-live-testimony-continues-in-john-jonchuck-murder-trial/1878141426,2019-03-27T02:44:48Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

1289,'Woman at War' battles climate change with a bow and arrow | Movie review,"Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir is determined to stop a new heavy-industry development by any means necessary in ""Woman at War."" (Photo: Magnolia Pictures)

“Woman at War” opens with a scene preparing us for the film to come: A woman, alone in the desolate, green highlands of Iceland, expertly (and cleverly, with bow and arrow) takes out a major electrical line running to a bleak, corrosive industrial facility. A game of cat and mouse with a helicopter ensues and our archer escapes in a surprising and delightful way, one with a clear suggestion: The past may still be of help.

The archer is Halla (an excellent Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir), a 50-year-old environmental activist working towards the destruction of the local aluminum industry. She lives a double-life: one, as a choir instructor and a second as a radical activist. At one, in her clean, bright apartment, Halla’s face aligns with two portraits of Gandhi and Mandela. How are we to take this suggestion?

""Woman"" walks a line between sincerity and dry humor (aided in part by a fantastic, minimalist score) that manages a quietly warm film about impending environmental disaster.

In the midst of her plans to write a manifesto, Halla receives a letter from an adoption agency. She’s been accepted and a young girl awaits her in a Ukrainian orphanage. The timing is inconvenient, of course. We discover — through her relationship with a government mole (Jörundur Ragnarsson), who also happens to sing in her choir — that the government is closing in.

The film relies on conveniently timed events and coincidentally placed characters, but director Benedikt Erlingsson embraces a surrealist undertone. A three-piece band and Ukrainian a cappella trio appear often in the background of scenes, breaking the fourth wall to light a cigarette or check a tweet. It feels like a wink and a nod in a film that could easily take itself too seriously. Yet Erlingsson uses the score earnestly, as the three Ukranian singers move closer and closer to the live band until the two eventually merge, mirroring the journey Halla must take.

Erlingsson’s film questions what it means to be a hero. Labeled by the media forces as the “Mountain Woman,” Halla ends up with a type of alter-ego that feels reminiscent of the superhero genre of late. Yet Halla also feels more tangibly heroic than the CGI characters of the Marvel and DC Universes.

As the stakes get higher, Halla becomes more and more part of the land she is trying to protect — she hides in holes, bogs and ice caves, gets massively dirty, and more than once must use sheep as various forms of disguise. Here is a film ripe with allusion for how we must interact with the world Halla is trying to save.

“Woman at War” succeeds largely because it doesn’t conform to expectations. Erlingsson continually shifts our gaze, providing us with new viewpoints for how to witness the drama of simply being a woman, of being someone constantly at war, waged purposefully or not.

By the end, we’re left feeling the title might also be commenting on something larger than Halla’s personal war against the aluminum industry.

Tom Rice, owner of Magnolia Grill, calls her a visionary. The historic restaurant and museum built in 1910 was given to Rice by Myers, who financed its restoration.

“She could look at old properties and old buildings and see the value in re-purposing,” Rice said. “She wanted to bring downtown back to life. She just had a sense of style. She was a smart businesswoman.”

A descendant of John and Harriet Brooks, who were original settlers of Fort Walton Beach, Myers redeveloped the area originally known as Camp Walton.

Among her projects were the Camp Walton Condominiums, the old grocery next door, the Miramar Office and Condominiums, the old Harbor Light Restaurant, the French Quarter Condominiums and Magnolia Grill to name a few. Additionally, Myers planted trees and preserved historic ones.

Myers also created the original mural on the Brooks Bridge.

“I think she is the only person who had a vision and knew how to preserve history,” said Ted Corcoran, Greater Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce president and CEO. “I do not think we would be where we are now as a community without her renovations that resurrected downtown.”

Okaloosa County Commissioner Carolyn Ketchel also credited Myers for the resurgence of downtown.

“She made major contributions to our area,” Ketchel said. “She really came back and said, ‘I want to make a difference in this community.’”

Myers moved back to Fort Walton Beach with her husband, Scott, to take care of her ailing mother, Diana “Billie” Pryor Sloat. Her mother was the first baby born in Fort Walton Beach.

The Myers moved away in 1968, traveling the world for 28 years while running their own consulting practice (both were industrial psychologists). Her husband died in 1996 from cancer.

In a recent Chamber of Commerce video, Myers said she loved Fort Walton Beach more than any other place. She recalled her father, Capt. John Sloat, would take people out on fishing trips in the Gulf of Mexico.

“It was just a rich time growing up here,” Myers said. “We just loved to be in Fort Walton.”

Myers, like her family members, has always been active in the community. She served on the Fort Walton Beach City Council and many other community organizations. The author and real estate developer earned induction into the Okaloosa County Commission on the Status of Women’s Hall of Fame in 2005.

Education was also important to Myers. She recalled in a Jan. 16, 2017, Daily News story that her great-grandfather John Thomas Brooks, who was a Civil War veteran, signed documents with an ""X.""

Her grandparents, W.C. Pryor and Sarah Frances Brooks Pryor, were education advocates. Her grandfather was the first superintendent of schools in Okaloosa County, while her grandmother was a philanthropist, businesswoman and the city’s postmistress for 28 years.

“When I was looking for an organization to support, I wanted something that was local, and something that was educational,” she said. “The college has a permanent presence in Northwest Florida, with deep roots in the community, much like my family.”

Myers donated $1 million to the Susan Myers Learning Resources Center at Northwest Florida State College.

“I thought and thought about different names,” Myers told the Daily News. “But the foundation officials kept coming and putting my name on it. They basically dragged me kicking and screaming until I finally agreed.”

Myers also established a separate, $90,000 bequest to fund six scholarship endowments in honor of Sarah Frances Brooks Pryor, W.C. Pryor, M. Scott Myers, Susan Pryor Sloat, Diana Pryor Sloat and John Gregory Sloat.

Longtime friend Ann Moore said she admired Myers, who received an associate’s degree in humanities from the University of Florida, a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Colorado and a master’s degree in industrial psychology from Southern Methodist University.

“She is one of the most brilliant women I have ever known,” Moore said. “She is more accomplished than any woman I have ever known. But she was quiet about it. She didn’t want any accolades.”

Liz McCartney recalled growing up with Myers on Brooks Street where Myers’ grandparents lived.

“She was a down-home girl,” McCartney said. “You had to love her, if you knew her. She was just a wonderful person.”",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190325/downtown-visionary-susan-myers-passes-away-at-age-74?rssfeed=true,2019-03-25T16:19:05Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
1295,Parkland community worried after 2 survivors’ suicides,"Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky said Monday that community leaders, government officials, parents, police and others held an emergency meeting Sunday after a second Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student apparently killed himself over the weekend.

FORT LAUDERDALE — Tragedies like the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High and Sandy Hook Elementary school massacres eventually fade from view, blunted by other mass shootings and the passage of time. But for the survivors, the pain can never end.

The father of a Sandy Hook victim killed himself Monday, just days after two Stoneman Douglas students also took their lives. The Florida deaths have officials in Parkland and nearby Coral Springs renewing their communities' focus on the suicide prevention and mental health resources that remain available 13 months after a gunman killed 17 people at the high school.

In Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 first-graders died along with six staff members six years ago, the body of 49-year-old Jeremy Richman was found outside his office Monday morning.

Richman's daughter Avielle was fatally shot at Sandy Hook. He had visited Florida last week and met with the parents of Stoneman Douglas victims, said Lori Alhadeff, whose 14-year-old daughter Alyssa died there.

Richman and his wife oversaw The Avielle Foundation, a group they started dedicated to preventing violence by better understanding brain health.

""Our hearts are shattered, and our heads are struggling to comprehend,"" the foundation said in a statement. ""Tragically, his death speaks to how insidious and formidable a challenge brain health can be and how critical it is for all of us to seek help for ourselves, our loved ones and anyone who we suspect may be in need.""

Multiple suicides among mass shooting survivors can be alarming, but mental health experts said the Florida deaths are not surprising. They come amid a rising nationwide trend: More than 47,000 U.S. suicides occurred in 2017, at the highest rate in at least half a century — 14 per 100,000. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among U.S. teenagers.

""One of the big risk factors for suicide is exposure to violence,"" said Dr. Louis Kraus, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.

Even if they weren't hit by bullets or didn't see shots fired, ""anyone who was at that school is at risk,"" Kraus said, and should be screened.

""The scars simply don't go away with a fresh coat of paint,"" he said.

Psychologist April Foreman, a board member at the American Association of Suicidology, said survivors are more prone to suicide and thus must be vigilant about mental health check-ups just as if they had a family history of breast cancer or heart disease.

With help, people can overcome their suicidal impulses, she said.

""It's not a foregone conclusion that this will happen to everyone who's been exposed to this and the majority of people who are suicidal don't go on to die. They go on to recover and live,"" she said.

The first suicide took place March 16. Cara Aiello told WFOR-TV last week that her 18-year-old daughter Sydney had suffered from survivor's guilt — her friend, Meadow Pollack, died in the attack.

Sydney had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and struggled to attend college because she feared being in a classroom, but never asked for help, her mother said.

Coral Springs police officer Tyler Reik confirmed Monday that a Stoneman Douglas sophomore apparently killed himself Saturday, but said an official determination had not been made pending an autopsy. The boy's name was not immediately released.

Community leaders, government officials, parents, police and others held an emergency meeting Sunday after the second student suicide, Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky said.

The biggest push will be to alert parents to talk to their children about whether they are having suicidal thoughts and outline the danger signs for them, such as personality changes or a preoccupation with death, she said.

The groups also want students to look out for each other, and noted that the community counseling and resource centers that opened after the attack still remain available.

The task has been made more difficult as Stoneman Douglas students are on spring break.

Hunschofsky said that while there is concern the two suicides could lead to more, it is more dangerous not to discuss what happened.

""We cannot be afraid of talking — the only way we are going to identify people who need help is to talk about it,"" she said.

A 16-year-old Stoneman Douglas sophomore who was in a classroom where three students died on Feb. 14, 2018, told The Associated Press on Monday that she tried to kill herself four times before she entered therapy.

At first, she was ashamed, she said, fearing that accepting counseling would mean she ""couldn't' handle my problems"" and ""I was broken."" But her attitude changed with the support of therapists, family and friends, said the girl, who the AP is not naming because of her age.

The girl said she fears not every Stoneman Douglas student who needs counseling is getting it and noted that some teachers seem uncomfortable talking about suicide and simply want to move on.

In Connecticut, Richman was among the Sandy Hook relatives suing Infowars host Alex Jones for contending the Newtown shooting never happened.

Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse Lewis, was killed at Sandy Hook, said the families' grief has been compounded by such conspiracy theories.

""Every day you get up, you expect to get punched in the chin,"" Heslin said. ""I give Jeremy credit for what he accomplished with his work and his amazing strength that grew through the years.""

Newtown Police Lt. Aaron Bahamonde said Richman left a suicide note, but did not disclose its contents.

On Monday, residents streamed into the Resiliency Center of Newtown, which was set up shortly after the shooting as a place for therapy and for people to gather to talk. Richman worked with the center in providing ""brain health"" first aid for children and others.

His friend, Stephanie Cinque, the center's executive director, said people are angry, sad and shocked by his death.

""There's mixed feelings throughout town,"" she said. ""Grief is complicated. It's very sad for the family, the children, the entire community. So today we're letting people know it's OK to have those feelings.""

The emotional scars survivors feel last for decades.

Columbine High massacre survivor Heather Martin was not physically injured in the 1999 shooting that left 13 dead, but said she took years to emotionally overcome the attack. She helped form the Rebels Project, named after Columbine's mascot, to assist mass trauma survivors.

""Resilience is connecting with other people and gaining strength from other people,"" Martin said. ""You don't always have to be the strongest person.""",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190325/parkland-community-worried-after-2-survivors-suicides?rssfeed=true,2019-03-25T15:27:04Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401

1301,"SECRET SCARS: Mother, daughter find hope in wake of father's sex abuse","In the dark hallway outside her bedroom, a man in body armor confronted Sharon with a gun.

Arms raised in surprise and surrender, she obeyed his commands.

Keep your hands up. Go to the kitchen. Face the wall.

A helicopter churned overhead, and emergency lights flashed from the yard. Were police seeking a fugitive hiding out in the thick woods around her Edgewater home?

That illusion crumbled with the clink of handcuffs closing around her wrists and dissolved completely as agents roused her daughters, Carrie and Kylie, from their rooms and secured them beside her.

Her husband, Scott, was nowhere in sight.

Police swarmed their home, searching bedrooms and sifting through clothes strewn across the floor. What they sought, Sharon didn’t know.

She had begun to suspect that something was wrong under her roof but just beyond her field of perception. In the early morning hours of Dec. 3, 2016, her fears came into focus.

Volusia County Sheriff’s Office investigators arrested Scott, a New Smyrna Beach city maintenance worker and Boy Scout leader, for molesting, recording and sharing pornographic images of Kylie — his 14-year-old daughter.

“(My husband) was doing this and that for the community, then his dark side is exposed,” said Sharon, 57, during one of several interviews. The News-Journal changed her name and the names of her family members to protect her daughter’s identity because she is a victim of sexual abuse. “To the arresting officer I said, ‘Thank you for getting me out of that hell.’”

The disturbing details that deputies revealed to Sharon that night in the backseat of a police car shed light on the source of her suspicions and propelled her toward an uncertain future.

She would be forced to confront long-buried memories from her own traumatic childhood. She would find refuge with a close friend. She would discover that her friend, too, had survived sexual abuse, and together they would seek healing at the Volusia Rape Crisis Center.

Amidst the rising tide of the #MeToo movement — a global call to end sexual violence and support abuse victims that was sparked by a series of accusations against high-profile men — she would choose to share her story so that it might give hope to others.

But first she would have to face the truth about Kylie.

‘She wanted to protect her children’

Sheriff’s office investigator Chastity Burke was notified on Dec. 2, 2016, that her subpoena of Scott’s internet account records had been returned. She’d been up early executing a search warrant but felt compelled to go back to the office and review the files right away.

“Something in my gut told me (it was urgent),” said Burke, 40, a seven-year member of the North Florida Internet Crimes Against Children task force.

Burke started investigating Scott after the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children — a Virginia-based nonprofit that helps law enforcement nationwide to identify victims of child sexual exploitation — tipped her in late September 2016 that Scott may have uploaded to the internet several images of adult men engaged in sex acts with female children as young as 1 or 2, an arrest report shows.

[MORE: VIRGINIA NONPROFIT, VOLUSIA DEPUTIES TEAM UP TO STOP CHILD EXPLOITATION]

Scott’s subpoenaed account files contained explicit material he had emailed to others — including images of him in the nude molesting his daughter, according to the report. It was the probable cause Burke needed to arrest Scott and search his house.

The possibility that the girl was in peril prioritized the warrants, and just after 11 p.m. that same night about 30 Special Weapons and Tactics and Child Exploitation Unit agents descended on Scott’s secluded Interstate 95-adjacent property. Scott answered the door naked, Burke said.

SWAT agents scoured the house for electronic devices and secured Scott’s family while Burke questioned him outside.

He downplayed his interactions with Kylie at first.

“He said he was trying to fit her for a bra,” Burke said. But when presented with photos printed from his email account, “he confessed to having an attraction toward his children. He was trying to groom (Kylie). He was hoping she would at some point do the things he wanted her to do.”

Kylie told detectives that her dad had shown her pornography, measured her “top and bottom” and ordered her Victoria’s Secret bras and panties, but denied he had sexually abused her. She was “upset” and “overwhelmed,” investigators said. “She seemed afraid and guarded.”

Sharon acknowledged that Scott walked around the house naked and made his kids uncomfortable but said she was unaware he had done “anything inappropriate” to Kylie, Burke said.

Sharon was adamant that if Scott harmed her girls, she would leave him. “I know she wanted to protect her children,” Burke said.

Burke would spend the next year searching Scott’s 20,000-plus emails. Among them she uncovered more pornographic images of Kylie that Scott had manufactured and sent to others. No additional local victims have been identified.

Sharon and her daughters didn’t disclose many damning details, but that didn’t matter. The proof was in the pictures.

Scared silent

Skeptics may doubt Sharon’s claim that she didn’t know what was happening in her home. Some might question Kylie’s reticence with investigators and wonder why she didn’t confide in her mother.

But such scenarios are common, said Shinece Carr, director of the Volusia Rape Crisis Center. As part of SMA Healthcare, the grant-funded crisis center provides free psychotherapy, group counseling, forensic examination support and other services for victims of sexual assault.

Parents who were sexually abused as children may see their kids showing signs of abuse but assume it’s their own trauma bubbling to the surface, Carr said — or they may be in denial. “It’s kind of like they’re reliving it for themselves when it happens to their child.”

By the time of Scott’s arrest, Sharon had suppressed for four decades the sexual trauma that blinded her to Kylie’s plight.

At age 14, a live-in adult uncle “started having sex with me,” Sharon recalled. She told a friend, and word got back to her parents. “All they did was slap him on the hand and tell him to get lost.”

The untreated trauma cast a shadow over her life and influenced her behavior, she said.

She met Scott at church when she was 18 and married him four years later in February 1985. They had two children.

More than a decade into their marriage, Scott changed, Sharon said. He spent significant time watching pornography and became “sexually aggressive,” she said. “If I’d try to get away, he would grab me.”

Scott kept katana swords on his side of the bed, Sharon said, and “I was afraid one of these days he would use (one) on me.”

Kylie was born in 2002. When she reached late elementary age, Sharon sensed a shift. Kylie clung to her and didn’t want to be left alone with Scott.

“(In hindsight), I should have caught it because it was done to me,” Sharon said. “Everyone says the woman’s got to know something. I did know something, but I didn’t know what.”

Sharon made repeated attempts to connect with her daughter, but when Sharon asked if she was troubled, “(Kylie) would say, ‘No, I just want to be with you.’”

Abused children keep quiet for several reasons, Carr said. They may not know how to articulate what they’re experiencing. They might fear repercussions or blame themselves.

“Or sometimes they think that a parent may not believe them over another adult,” Carr said. And if the abuser is someone they know and love, “it makes it difficult for the child to say anything.”

Boys start speaking up around ages 12 or 13, and girls at 14 to 16, Carr said. Kylie had reached that range and — made easier by Scott’s extraction from her life — the truth started trickling out in therapy and during conversations with Sharon.

Secret scars

A vandal painted the words “child molester” on the road in front of Sharon’s home with an arrow pointing toward her tree-shrouded driveway after media outlets reported Scott’s arrest.

Kylie had no safe haven. Memories of Scott’s abuse spoiled her sacred spaces. She grew withdrawn, hid herself inside hooded jackets and her mother worried she was entertaining suicidal thoughts.

She’d been an active participant in the family’s New Smyrna Beach church, where her artistic abilities were encouraged. She sang in the choir, performed interpretive dances, acted in skits and led children’s activities at summer camp.

But Scott had molested her at church, too — in between services when no one was around, and in the sound booth before concerts, Sharon said. “It was no longer a sanctuary for her.”

Sharon needed to move her daughters out of their house but didn’t have the money. Her longtime friend, Marissa, supplied a solution.

Marissa, whose name The News-Journal has changed because she also is a sex abuse survivor, was living alone in a three-bedroom house in Edgewater. When she heard about Sharon’s situation, she didn’t hesitate. “I said, ‘That’s it. You’re moving in with me,’” Marissa said.

The Volusia Rape Crisis Center helped pay for the move and purchased Kylie a new bed.

Relocation is a little-known service the center provides, but an essential one, Carr said.

“We know we can bring you for counseling 100 times and give it to you for free,” she said. “But my counselor is not going to be able to do anything for you until you feel safe.”

As Sharon and her daughters settled in with Marissa and started therapy at the crisis center, Sharon’s childhood trauma bubbled up.

During an interview with a victim advocate, she remembered afresh the hurts she had pushed down for years — the uncle in his 30s who moved in with her family, the times he raped her and his failed plan to prostitute her. She recalled the anger she felt when her parents chose not to pursue prosecution, and how she sought sex with peers as an act of rebellion.

“It was a double whammy,” Sharon said, reckoning with her daughter’s abuse as well as her own. “This is a scar deep down inside that you can’t see. Everyone that I pass, I wonder if they’re going through the same thing I am.”

Many crisis center clients are referred by law enforcement or nurses. Some, such as Sharon and Kylie, transfer from another agency when assistance is limited due to funding. And others, like Marissa, reach out directly.

Several months after Sharon’s family moved in, Marissa was flipping through old photos and came across one that “unlocked a memory,” she said. “All of a sudden it all flooded back to me.”

Her mind flashed to a family friend molesting her in her bedroom when she was 10 years old.

“I guess I had blocked it out because you don’t want to think about that,” said Marissa, 41. She panicked, and threw the picture across the room.

Her new housemates understood her pain better than most.

“I kind of curled up into myself and cried. Then (Kylie) came over and put her arms around me and said, ‘It’s OK.’ It was something she had gone through and she helped me through it.”

Trauma suppression is a safety mechanism, Carr said. “If your brain feels shutting down is the best thing for you and saves you, that’s what it’s going to do,” she said.

Something as seemingly innocuous as a fragrance, a person’s mannerisms or a spoken phrase can awaken memories of abuse many years or even decades later, Carr said.

When Marissa’s buried memories surfaced, Sharon took her to a group counseling session. There, Marissa signed up for individual therapy. And because crisis center clients can access SMA Healthcare’s mental health and substance abuse treatment services, she was able to get medication for the deep depression she’d been battling.

“It’s really, really helped me tremendously,” Marissa said. “(Without the crisis center’s help) I’ll tell you exactly where I’d be — dead.”

‘Keep healing, keep going’

Kylie looked forward to testifying at her father’s trial but she didn’t get that chance.

On Feb. 21, 2018, Scott pleaded no contest to lewd or lascivious exhibition of a child under 16, promoting the sexual performance of a child and three counts of possession of a sexual performance by a child.

He was sentenced to 20 years in state prison and registered as a sex offender. He’ll be eligible for release in 2035.

His family and Marissa say it’s not enough.

“That sentence is way too light for him, especially given the overreaching things that (Kylie) has to deal with for the rest of her life,” Marissa said.

More than two years after Scott’s arrest, Kylie has been bullied at school, is still in therapy and, her mother said, suffers from blackouts — a suppression tactic she employed during her father’s abuse.

But she’s achieved breakthroughs, too — they all have.

Marissa decided together with her crisis center therapist that she has worked through her past trauma and no longer requires counseling.

She hopes speaking out about her experience “will help other people step forward and say, ‘That happened to me, too,’ and not be ashamed,” she said. “If you can help one person, you can help many.”

Sharon’s divorce from Scott is final, and she recently received her portion of proceeds from Scott’s retirement plan and the sale of their property. She and Marissa have purchased the house they live in, a much-needed layer of stability, and Sharon has ventured back into the dating scene.

Between shifts at the retail job she's held for 20 years, she enjoys painting, photography and crafting beaded jewelry.

“I used to be cornered and fighting to get out, and (the crisis center) gave me the tools to get out,” Sharon said. “We’ve just got to keep healing, keep going.”

Helping clients gain independence is key to the crisis center’s mission, Carr said.

“I always like to tell victims that you finally found your lion inside of you,” she said. A painting of the fearsome animal hangs in her office as a reminder.

“Some have been stripped of their voice, their power,” she said. “We love to provide that safe blanket of support with different wraparound services, but we also help them find their voice, their self-esteem, to empower them.”

Kylie is a perfect example. She loved photography, and then her father took illicit pictures of her. She was interested in fashion, and he made her an unwitting model.

But the creativity that withered under Scott’s surreptitious gaze has begun to bloom again.

Kylie, now 17, plans to study sewing and fashion design at Daytona State College after she graduates high school next year. She draws dress patterns and often wears clothes she created herself. Her style has attracted some classmates’ admiration, Sharon said.

The girl who once cowered under loose-fitting clothes and hid behind her mother in public is no longer in retreat. She’s turned her armor into art.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190330/secret-scars-mother-daughter-find-hope-in-wake-of-fathers-sex-abuse?rssfeed=true,2019-03-30T18:23:15Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
1303,Training for a marathon? Expert says you should start 16 weeks ahead,"- Marathon season is upon us, and training sessions have -- and should be -- in session.

Whether you’re preparing for your first race, a seasoned pro, or someone who’s simply a bit distance-race curious, we can all learn a thing or two from a coach like Earl Walton. Walton is the global director of training and coaching for IRONMAN. Over the last two decades he’s helped athletes of all abilities train for some of the toughest races on Earth.

Good Day caught up with Walton ahead of Sunday’s Iron Girl Clearwater Half Marathon and 5k race to get his advice on training to go the distance:

Obviously marathons and half-marathons attract runners of different abilities so every training program is going to look a little different, but what are the core workouts that every distance runner should be doing as they prepare for race day?

Earl: We want to see a really good mix of workouts. Cross training is really important, strength and stability work is really important. Make sure you fit it in and you’re being efficient with your time. We also want a real mix of running speeds. There should be one day that’s super easy, 30 to 45 minutes at a light, easy pace. One day that’s called a tempo run: so you’re running at like a seven out of a scale of 10. A nice, hard effort that’s 10 or 12 minute intervals like that. Then we want to see a couple days that are hard effort. Get some track work in. Really push yourself and see what you’re capable of. Then of course you need to get a couple of long runs in and progress your distance.

What’s the biggest mistake you see people make in their training?

Earl: When we get into longer marathon type stuff you’re looking at people emphasizing the long run over all other things. Basically they forget about consistency. A lot of times what happens is that people won’t work out all week and then they’re so scared that they have to get their 20-miler or their long run in and they go out and they run hard not realizing that when they go out for that long run it’s going to take a long time to recover from that. By going out and running for two hours on a Saturday, they’ll need three or four days to recover from that. So you end up losing training time. Consistency over a long run this is always the most important thing. I’d rather see someone run four times a week for 30 minutes to an hour than to just do one or two hour or 90 minute runs in a week.

We’re in Florida where there simply aren’t a lot of hills to train on. For those preparing for say, the Boston Marathon, how can they train for hills without a hill?

Earl: One thing we do have plenty of is wind. One of the great things about wind is it’s resistance. If I wanted to do hill repeats with 2 to 5 minutes of hill work, I would substitute 2 to 5 minutes of running against the wind and then recover two minutes back out. Those are great intervals and that’s going to work on resistance training. That’s essentially what the hill is.

Stairs and treadmills are great, but honestly what I like to see is people doing heavy gear work on a bike and weight training. Those things are going to build the muscle groups that you want. The other thing is speed work on the track, which is actually closer to a hill rather than doing stairs because you’re working with different muscle groups.

Some distance runners are sometimes apprehensive about weight training because they’re afraid of bulking up. Legitimate fear? What’s your pitch for making weight training a part of marathon training?

Earl: If you asked a bodybuilder how hard it is to put on weight and to bulk up, they would pretty much tell all of our skinny little runners that you’re not going to bulk up that quickly. It doesn’t happen overnight. You have to do a lot of work to get bulky so I’m not afraid of the weight room for that reason. You should spend one or two days in the weight room.

What kinds of strength exercises do you recommend?

Earl: Do things like squats and lunges. Step back lunges are one of my favorite exercises for runners. You step back, engage your core and drive your leg forward just like you’re in a running motion. It’s really great for your posture. I love to see core work and using resistance bands to work the glutes. Make sure you’re also doing lateral movements from side to side. We tend to run in one direction but we want to make sure we’re covering all the bases because you have to have that stability in your core and glutes.

What about time goals? How do you work on getting faster?

Earl: If you want to get faster, you’ve got to run faster. That’s a mantra that every coach will say. That’s why we do intervals. To run fast you need to work on having great running form and you also need to open your eyes and your mental awareness to the fact that you can run faster. If I’m used to running eight minute miles then I head to a track for a speed work out and I realize that one of my intervals was at a six minute mile pace I’m going to realize, oh my gosh I can go faster! So the next time I do a long run, rather than doing eight minute miles I might start to bring that down to 7:50. Over time I’ll start to see my times improve. There’s a physiological benefit to track work, but the mental benefit is the bigger part of it.

A progression run uses the same mentality and is an awesome way to look at it. Whenever we look at our plans, 85% of your race should be run at the pace you know you can do, but that last 15% should be what you think you can do. That’s where you’re going to push and test your training. A progression run does that. Let’s say you’re running 10 miles. You start off slow and you start to build and ease into it. By the final two miles you’re pushing as hard as you can. The whole idea is to see what you’ve got in the tank. You see that finish line and you push as hard as you can.

How long do you recommend runners devote to a training program for say, a half marathon?

Earl: There’s different theories but typically 16 weeks is what we like to say. 16 weeks gives you the proper amount of time to set a base of fitness and then build on that. I like to focus on race-specific training for eight weeks of that program. That’s where you’re doing those intervals and really testing how fast you can run.

What should one do if they fall off their training during that 16 weeks? How can they salvage their race?

Earl: That’s One of the biggest questions I get. You have to rely on your fitness and you have to go in with a realistic goal. You should race to what you’ve trained for. If you’ve only trained for three weeks, then just go out there and have fun. Take in the crowds, meet the people, have fun with what you’re doing. If you’ve been training hard, then test your training. Take that 85-percent of the race at what you know you can do, and then push yourself for the last 15-percent and run for the finish line. The most important part is preparing for the time you’re going to be on the course.

What’s your take on crash training? E.g. I’ve only been training for Sunday’s race for three weeks?

Earl: I have to caveat everything because if you have injuries or other issues then obviously you have to be safe and you have to know what you’re capable of. But if I have three weeks and I haven’t been training, but I’ve done a couple of long runs to kind of go out and just see what I’m capable of distance-wise: how long it’s going to take me, a set a mental time in my head for how long to expect to be out there, that’s much different than thinking about going and running 13 miles. Maybe I make a plan where I’m going to run for four minutes and walk for one minute, then when I get to mile 10 and I still feel good I’ll push myself for that final 85-percent. That’s a common strategy for people who have under-trained. If you’re fit and you’re capable of running 13 miles without stopping then you should be fine, just don’t expect a PR.",http://www.fox13news.com/health/training-for-a-marathon-expert-says-you-should-start-16-weeks-ahead,2019-03-29T17:12:27Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609
1307,State rests case against John Jonchuck in murder trial,"State rests case against John Jonchuck in murder trial Video Video

PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - Day three of the high-profile John Jonchuck murder trial is underway in Pinellas County.

Jonchuck is the man accused of dropping his 5-year-old daughter Phoebe to her death off the Dick Misener Bridge near the Sunshine Skyway in St. Petersburg four years ago.

The trial was delayed several years, but a jury comprised of nine men and seven women was seated Friday.

Jonchuck was being treated at a mental health facility up until recently. The judge warned the jury that he is medicated and they must not let his present condition in court or side effects from the medications affect their decision-making process.

State prosecutors say they will not seek the death penalty in this case. If found guilty, Jonchuck could serve life in prison. If the jury finds him innocent, he'll stay in a mental institution.

DAY 3 UPDATES:

The first witness called to the stand on day three of the trial was Dr. Christopher Wilson, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Phoebe.

After very brief testimony from the medical examiner, the judge asked for a recess and let the jury out of the courtroom so a ""legal issue"" could be taken care of. Once the jury was out of the room, the attorneys and judge discussed which photos of Phoebe can be shown during the trial to the jury.

After hearing arguments from both sides, the judge ruled only one photo of each injury Phoebe sustained will be admissible, as well as one photo of her face.

Dr. Wilson continued his testimony once the jury was back in the room. As autopsy photos of his daughter were shown to the jury, Jonchuck sat with his face in his hands and a tear in his eye.

State prosecutors rested their case against Jonchuck around 11:40 a.m. The judge ordered a brief 15-minute recess before the trial resumes.

The judge wrapped court for the day around 4 p.m. It will resume at 9 a.m. Thursday.

DAY 2 RECAP:

On day two of the trial, the jury first heard testimony from three additional officers who were involved with the investigation into Phoebe's death. During that testimony, jurors saw the large Swedish Bible that officers say Jonchuck had on him the night Phoebe died. Officer shows Bible from night Phoebe...

After that testimony concluded, prosecutors started showing video of Jonchuck in the interrogation room after being taken into custody back in 2015. Much of the interrogation room video shown so far features Jonchuck sitting by himself waiting to be questioned.

At one point, Jonchuck starts talking to the authorities in the room about a conspiracy and ""something bigger going on"" that's ""beyond me, beyond everything.""

Jonchuck: 'I think there's something...

""It's almost like - I'm not being weird - this is like a conspiracy. I went looking for answers, I've always had problems growing up like wondering who I was and what my purpose was,"" he said.

In the video, Jonchuck also talks about going to a church and speaking with ""Father Bill."" Jonchuck told a detective in the room that the father said he ""wasn't going to be ready this Easter but next Easter"" and that, ""I was the pope.""

Jonchuck talks about 'conspiracy'

After almost an hour of being in the interrogation room, Jonchuck asks about his daughter.

""Is Phoebe OK?"" he asks the detective sitting with him.

The detective responds asking who Phoebe is. After a long pause with his head in his hand, Jonchuck responds, ""Phoebe was my daughter.""

Jonchuck: 'Is Phoebe OK?'

Judge Chris Helinger called the prosecutors and defense attorneys to her bench after watching about an hour of the interrogation room video. Judge Helinger decided to call for a lunch break, putting court in recess until 2 p.m.

When court resumed, the jury watched the rest of the interrogation room video before attorneys cross-examined a detective and a former Hillsborough County deputy.

Jonchuck's mother Michele then took the stand and got emotional talking about her granddaughter Phoebe, who she referred to as her ""princess angel.""

Jonchuck's mom takes the stand

Jonchuck's mother was excused after giving testimony about swim lessons for Phoebe and who was caring for the girl.

Prosecutors then called Sgt. Kenny Miller to the stand. Miller was assigned as the lead detective on the case involving Phoebe's death. While on the stand, Sgt. Miller described getting to the scene around 1:20 a.m. Jan. 8, 2015 and seeing crews searching for Phoebe.

Miller testified that the girl's body was found just after 1:30 a.m.

""The boats were coming in and I saw Phoebe come off one of the rescue boats and they were performing CPR on her,"" Miller said. ""She was wet, she had what looked like pajamas on. And she looked very pale.""

Miller said he did not see any signs of life and did not see Phoebe breathing.

Sgt. Miller testifies about getting...

While Sgt. Miller remained on the stand, attorneys continued to show the video of Jonchuck in the interrogation room after being taken into custody. At one point, Jonchuck asks where the detective is who is supposed to question him. He then comments, ""I just want to go to bed, I don't want to talk to anybody.""

Jonchuck: 'I just want to go to bed'

Shortly after Jonchuck makes that comment, the video shows Sgt. Miller walk into the interrogation room. He then begins questioning Jonchuck about what happened for about eight minutes.

Interrogation room video: Sgt. Miller...

DAY 1 RECAP:

On Monday, the jurors heard opening statements from prosecution and defense teams.

The prosecution's opening statement lasted more than an hour. During that time, attorney Paul Bolan walked the jury through the events that took place at the Dick Misener Bridge just after midnight on Jan. 8, 2015.

Interrogation room video: Sgt. Miller...

Bolan also addressed the defense's argument that Jonchuck was insane at the time of his daughter's death.

""The defense will argue that the defendant was insane at the time that he committed this murder. And I want you to keep in mind that the defense has to establish that by clear and convincing evidence,"" he said. ""You've been read a jury instruction for insanity but I'm going to read it to you again because it's important and we need to consider it. And we need to consider carefully what these words say. A person is considered to be insane when he had a mental infirmity, disease or defect. But the analysis does not stop there. Someone is not insane just because they have mental illness, just because there's something wrong with them or they may say things that sound strange.""

Prosecutor addresses mental illness...

The defense team also walked through the events of the night of Phoebe's death, talking about Jonchuck's actions before, during and after his daughter's death. Attorney Jessica Manuele did not deny that Jonchuck dropped his daughter off the bridge, but called it an act of insanity.

""What happened just after midnight (that night) was tragic. That night, John Jonchuck Jr. took his daughter, whom he loved more than anybody in the world and dropped her over the side of the Dick Misener Bridge,"" Manuele said. ""It didn't make sense at the time, it doesn't make sense today. It will never make sense because it is insanity.""

Defense begins opening statement

Manuele told jurors that Jonchuck got out of his car on the bridge holding a large Swedish Bible, then got his daughter Phoebe out and dropped her off the bridge. She argued that Jonchuck was calm and did not hurry away, despite a St. Petersburg police officer witnessing what happened.

Defense gives statements on night of...

The defense team also urged jurors to focus heavily on the evidence without letting emotion get in the way.

""Nobody is disputing that what happened that night was tragic. But if you feel that your heartstrings are being intentionally tugged on, pay attention to that,"" she said. ""We have to focus on the evidence.""

After opening statements wrapped up, two witnesses were called to the stand. The first was St. Petersburg Police Officer William Vickers. Vickers is the officer who was on the Dick Misener Bridge when Phoebe was dropped.

Officer William Vicker recalls night...

In his testimony, Officer Vickers talked about his actions after Phoebe was dropped.

""I was immediately concerned for the child. I advised radio of what had happened. I was shocked but my immediate concern was the health, welfare and safety of the child,"" he said.

Vickers also described hearing a ""faint scream and a splash"" after Phoebe was dropped from the bridge. The officer says he then climbed down a nearby service ladder to try and search for the child.

""It was in the 40s, low 40s. The winds were gusting over 20 miles an hour. At a couple points, I was nearly blown off the bumper walkway area at the bottom of the bridge,"" he said, adding that the water was rough, dark and cold.

""I continued to call until a fire rescue boat arrived in the area. At that point, I got on to assist in searching and coordinating between police and fire resources,"" Vickers said. ""I looked at my watch a couple of times thinking 'we gotta find her, we gotta find her.'""

'We gotta find her': Officer...

The second witness called to the stand was a toll collector who gave a brief testimony about what he saw the night Phoebe died.

After the first two witnesses finished testifying, the judge ended court for the day and instructed jurors not to listen to, watch or talk about anything related to the trial.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/watch-live-testimony-continues-in-john-jonchuck-murder-trial/1878141426,2019-03-27T20:17:07Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1308,Gifford man wanted in connection with deadly drive-by turns himself in,"CLOSE Christard Hicks of Fort Pierce was killed in the shooting Lamaur Stancil, 4/21/18

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — A Gifford man wanted for a month in connection with a drive-by shooting that ended a Fort Pierce teen's life turned himself in shortly after midnight Tuesday at the Indian River County Sheriff's Office.

Dominique Riggins, 30, of the 4200 block of 36th Court, is charged with accessory after the fact to the murder of Christard Hicks.

Hicks, 19, was killed April 20 when a man wearing all black fired a .223-caliber rifle from a car on a crowd of young people gathered outside a Gifford home in the late afternoon.

In July, a grand jury indicted Dominique Riggins' cousin, Jamal Riggins Jr., a 20-year-old former Sebastian River High School football standout, on a first-degree murder charge.

Witness accounts led detectives to believe Jamal Riggins Jr. was the shooter and the vehicle involved belonged to Dominique Riggins, according to arrest records.

One witness said she knew the killer was Jamal Riggins Jr., as she had ""seen his face,"" warrants said.

The murder weapon was never recovered, but inside Dominique Riggins' Chrysler 200, deputies reported finding a receipt for a .223-caliber KelTec rifle purchased in Gifford Jan. 31, 2018.

That is the same caliber as the bullets that killed Hicks and were found lodged in the home's walls, a detective said.

Dominique Riggins spoke with detectives three days after the shooting when his Chrysler was seized during a traffic stop.

The black window tint witnesses described was not there. Dominique Riggins told them he had removed the tint days before the shooting, but surveillance from a gas station disproved that account, according to his arrest warrant.

He has since declined to speak with law enforcement without an attorney present.

Arrest warrants do not make clear whether any forensic evidence exists linking either of the cousins to the shooting.

Witnesses said the shooter was wearing a black durag and a black shirt.

A black durag found near the scene had another man's DNA on it, the warrant said. That man said he was on Interstate 95 at the time of the shooting and he doesn't wear durags, as he has dreadlocks.

Jamal Riggins Jr.'s girlfriend told a detective she had picked Jamal Riggins Jr. up from Dominique Riggins' house after the shooting.

There were two short calls between the cousins in the half-hour before the shooting (the only on Jamal Riggins Jr.'s phone in that time frame) as well as another about 90 minutes later, according to warrants.

Jamal Riggins Jr. is being held without bail and also faces five counts of attempted murder, as well as possession of a firearm by a prohibited person.

He has pleaded not guilty and is represented by Melbourne attorney Sean Wagner.

1309,Former Winter Haven man charged with 'horrific' sexual battery on child,"Winter Haven Public Safety Director Charlie Bird: ""The path of emotional and physical destruction he caused is reprehensible and we will do everything within our power to make sure he will never be able to hurt another child again.""

WINTER HAVEN — After a four-month investigation that started in Winter Haven and ended in Knoxville, Tennessee, a 37-year-old man was arrested for sexual battery on a child under the age of 12.

Winter Haven Police Department arrested Manuel Tavis McGhee, charging him with two counts of sexual battery on a child under the age of 12; charges, they say, stem from repeated sex abuse on two children when McGhee lived in Winter Haven.

The mother of one of the victims, identified as Victim A, notified police in late 2018 that her daughter told her she had been abused by McGhee.

In an interview with investigators, the 15-year-old said she had been abused from age 5 to 11, according to the police.

The girl revealed ""extremely horrific and explicit details of the abuse she incurred from the age of five,"" according to a forensic interview with police.

Additionally, she told investigators her brother, identified as Victim B, who is a couple of years older, had endured the same type of abuse during those same years.

In 2013, two separate reports about McGhee were made to the Lakeland Police Department, involving Victim B and two other alleged victims in Lakeland that year. Both incidents were reported and investigated but formal charges were ultimately dropped, according to the WHPD investigation. During those Lakeland investigations, officers then had reported that McGhee said he had been accused of similar acts in 2006 while stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina with the U.S. Army.

In that case, McGhee had been charged with 15 counts of sexual battery on a child but the case was ultimately dropped by the U.S. Army, which had requested to prosecute the case instead of local authorities, ""due to a lack of evidence and McGhee's denial of all allegations,"" WHPD spokeswoman Jamie Brown said in a press release.

""The incidents were very similar to the incidents that occurred in the Winter Haven case,"" she added.

Based on McGhee's history of allegations, Victim A and Victim B were interviewed in December.

Victim B said the abuse started when he was 8 or 9 years old in North Carolina. The description of the abuse mirrored what Victim A reported, noted Brown.

Victim B also told police that the abuse continued in Lakeland and Winter Haven.

Regarding the 2013 allegation by Victim B, he told investigators recently he was afraid of what McGhee would do to him if he shared details. But by the time Victim B spoke to Winter Haven police, Victim B disclosed the details because McGhee had moved away and he said he didn't feel threatened any more.

WHPD detectives followed the North Carolina allegations and met with a Georgia woman identified as a victim in those reports.

This woman said that when she was nine years old McGhee had abused her, and the pattern was identical to the other victims that were interviewed, according to WHPD reports.

A sibling of this victim also detailed abuse in a separate interview with Winter Haven detectives, according to a WHPD media release.

Based on the totality of the statements made by numerous victims across multiple agencies, Winter Haven detectives obtained a warrant to arrest McGhee. He was taken into custody in Knoxville and is awaiting extradition back to Florida.

""I can say one thing — that I am so proud of our detectives and their tenacity to ensure that there are no more children that this monster can hurt,"" said Winter Haven Public Safety Director Charlie Bird. ""The path of emotional and physical destruction he caused is reprehensible and we will do everything within our power to make sure he will never be able to hurt another child again.""

1318,"Two killed, four injured in SR 200 crash","Two children, ages 2 and 6, were hospitalized in serious condition Monday afternoon

OCALA — Two people were killed in a two-vehicle wreck at an Ocala intersection on Monday afternoon.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers identified the deceased as 81-year-old Franklin E. Kraus and Jane E. Tait, 70. Both were from Ocala, and they were in separate vehicles, troopers said.

Four other people, including two children, wereinjured in the crash. The children, ages 2 and 6 from Durham, North Carolina, were taken to UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville in serious condition. Authorities said the boy and girl, who are siblings, were restrained in their car seats.

The crash occurred at 12:21 p.m., troopers said.

According to FHP officials, a black 2012 Lexus RX 350 driven by William Tait, 70, of Ocala, was traveling on State Road 200 toward Citrus. Troopers said the Lexus had the green light to enter the intersection of SR 200 and County Road 484.

Kraus, driving a red 2016 GMC Terrain, was traveling eastbound on CR 484 when he entered the intersection.

Troopers said the Lexus was T-boned by the GMC vehicle, causing the Lexus to overturn at least once. The vehicle landed on its wheels at the intersection, officials said.

Kraus, who was wearing his seat belt, was transported to Ocala Regional Medical Center where he died. Marion County Fire Rescue officials had to extricate him from the vehicle.

Jane Tait, who was wearing her seat belt, died at the scene, troopers said.

MCFR officials had to cut the doors and roof from the Lexus to remove the occupants.

Tait’s husband was transported to ORMC in serious condition. He was wearing his seat belt, officials said.

FHP officials said Laura Campbell, 40, a relative of the Taits and mother of the two children, was taken to ORMC in serious condition. She's from Durham, North Carolina.

1320,Yale's Whiffenpoofs set to perform in Cocoa Beach with first female member,"Catch a new Whiff.

The girls have made their way into a unique male bastion of song. Actually, make it the girl.

Tenor Sofia Campoamor of Washington, DC, is the first woman to join the Yale Whiffenpoofs, the world’s oldest and best-known collegiate a cappella group. Campoamor's acceptance into the 110-year-old singing group has drawn national media attention from outlets such as the Washington Post, the New York Times, National Public Radio and more. In February, the group eliminated gender restrictions.

""This is an exciting and historic year for the Whiffenpoofs,” said Nick Massoud, Whiffenpoof and business manager for the group.

Campoamor and the rest of the “Whiffs” will perform Saturday in Cocoa Beach as part of the group’s latest national tour. The performance is sponsored by the Space Coast Symphony Orchestra.

""The Whiffs are the best of the best,” said Space Coast Symphony conductor and artistic director Aaron Collins. “How many musical organizations do you know that have been around for more than a century, with more fans than ever?”

Being accepted into the elite Ivy League singing group is a huge accomplishment for any singer, male or female. Young singers compete in their junior year for one of just 14 coveted spots. Past Whiffs include the legendary Cole Porter, who sang in the 1913 line-up and is the reason the tuxedoed group is fond of performing some of his iconic songs in tribute. The Whiffenpoofs have made appearances on “Glee” and “The Sing-off,” among other television shows.

At the Cocoa Beach concert, the audience can expect a broad repertory of exclusively original arrangements of jazz standards, ballads, show tunes, pop and rock music and humorous numbers. Shows traditionally conclude with the signature ""Whiffenpoof Song,"" written in 1909 and recorded by a widely different musical stars, from Rudy Vallee, Bing Crosby and Elvis Presley to Count Basie, Perry Como, the Statler Brothers, and countless others.

Founded in 1909, the Yale Whiffenpoofs are the world's oldest and best-known collegiate a cappella group. This year's lineup of seniors includes tenor Sofia Campoamor, the first female member of the Whiffenpoofs. For their 110th. anniversary tour, the Whiffs will be in Cocoa Beach for two concerts sponsored by the Space Coast Symphony Orchestra. (Photo: Photo provided by Yale Whiffenpoofs)

The Whiffs will sing in Brevard at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Saturday at the First United Methodist Church of Cocoa Beach, 3300 N. Atlantic Ave. Tickets are $25 in advance and $30 at the door. Purchase advance tickets at SpaceCoastSymphony.org at the orchestra’s official ticket outlet, Marine Bank & Trust in Suntree (Flex tickets and Nine to Five Passes will not be accepted for this special programs).

As with all Symphony-orchestrated concerts, the shows are free for those aged 18 and under with student identification.

1322,Memorial for victims of New Zealand massacre held at Melbourne mosque,"CLOSE A capacity crowd filled the mosque at the Islamic Society of Brevard County during Saturday's memorial for victims of the New Zealand mass killing. Craig Bailey, Florida Today

Hundreds gathered at the Islamic Society of Brevard County Saturday afternoon to mourn the dozens killed in an attack at a New Zealand mosque nearly two weeks ago.



Worshippers of all faiths were present at the Melbourne mosque to show their support for the local Muslim community in a moment of solidarity after a white supremacist terrorist entered a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand March 15 and gunned down 50 worshipers, injuring dozens more.



The events gripped people of all faiths across the globe after they were live-streamed by the attacker, who espoused white supremacist views in an online manifesto.

Melbourne police were investigating a potential threat made toward the mosque even as those inside called for peace. Police officials said the generic threat was potentially sent to multiple houses of worship in other places as well as members of the Melbourne mosque.

Police did not immediately release any information on the nature or credibility of the threat, which was sent by email.



“There is no greater fear that you can drive in the hearts of the terrorists than to show them we stand together,” said Alli B. Majeed, a retired Brevard County judge, who guided the event.



The vigil was attended by representatives from local churches and temples as well as law enforcement.

Among the crowd was Gerda Stokler, someone who knows first-hand how important it is to stand up to religious bigotry. The 95-year-old Jewish woman fled Nazi Germany as a little girl in the 1930s.

""Violence against anyone's faith is important to me because of how it affected me,"" she said. ""I was put on this earth and saved to do some good.""

“There is no greater fear that you can drive in the hearts of the terrorists than to show them we stand together.” Alli B. Majeed, a retired Brevard County judge

Speakers like the Islamic Society's president, Feras Qasami, noted that religious bigotry isn't exclusively Islamophobic in nature, pushing the importance of interfaith solidarity.



""A few months ago we were at the temple. The same thing happened over there,"" Qasami said, referencing the Tree of Life synagogue shooting that left left 11 Jewish worshippers dead in Pittsburgh. ""And now our brothers from the Jewish community are here.""

They came for a memorial to the victims of the massacre in New Zealand and to show their solidarity with Muslims living locally. (Photo: Craig Bailey/FLORIDA TODAY)

Mohsen Alhaddad, who works on interfaith outreach with the mosque, was among the speakers Saturday who issued a strong rebuke against those, who he said spread racial and religious hatred.

He described how a ""false narrative about Islam and Muslims"" can promote violence.

""This is one of the consequences of the constant barrage of manufactured fear and dehumanizing rhetoric toward Muslims,"" Alhaddad said. ""On the other side, there are Muslim extremists who will be eager to retaliate as we have seen in the past.""

""This catastrophic recipe for unrelenting violence must be rejected.""

The event was attended and heavily guarded by officers from Melbourne and Palm Bay police departments.

""We want to thank you for including us in this event. We do believe we are one community,"" said Palm Bay Police Chief Jim Rogers. ""For law enforcement, we're going to be more vigilant. We have to be.""

1331,John Jonchuck trial begins with competing narratives over vengeance and insanity,"Opening statements got underway Monday in the murder trial of a man accused of throwing his 5-year-old daughter Phoebe off a Tampa Bay area bridge as a police officer watched helplessly.

ZACK AND CLAIRE (3:52 p.m.)

Jonchuck drove off, south on 275 toward the Skyway, after dropping Phoebe.

Vickers ran to the edge of the bridge, looking for anything in the water

“I didn’t see anything,” he recalls.

“It was very cold and windy that night.”

Bolan asks how cold. “I’d say low 40s.”

How windy? Vickers describes gusts of about 20 miles per hour. The water, he says, was rough. “Very dark and cold.”

The officer recalls nearly being blown off a buffer wall by the water by the wind.

Jonchuck is back to rocking, now side to side, in tight little motions.

Vickers says searching in the water was stressful, but the defense objects to say that’s irrelevant. Sustained.

Vickers later learns the Eckerd search crew found Phoebe’s body. She was later transferred to a boat he was on, and he tried to perform compressions to get her breathing again.

He then describes Phoebe’s body in detached terms. “Foamy water came out of the mouth and nose. The eyes had a brownish-red tinge to it and the pupils were nonreactive. ... Cold to the touch.”

ZACK, CLAIRE AND JOSH (3:49 p.m.)

Vickers was about one car-length back when they stopped on top of the bridge.

The driver, he said, “began approaching me with something large in his hand.” Vickers, speaking in formal police language, says he drew his weapon, afraid Jonchuck might get violent. He remembers the driver saying, “You have no free will.”

He is not using Jonchuck’s name. For delivering such emotional, awful testimony, Vickers is speaking extraordinarily flatly, in neutral terms. This is all just establishing facts. Jonchuck does not appear to be in the same kind of distress as he was when the prosecution delivered its opening statement.

Vickers calls Phoebe “the child.” He says he thought she was 7 or 8 years old, with long brown hair.

“The lighting was kind of arid, it wasn’t super great, typical highway lighting,” Vickers says, describing a slight orange glow.

The jury seems to be paying close attention, looking quickly back and forth between Vickers, the state attorney and Jonchuck. Jonchuck watches Vickers.

“I was immediately concerned for the child, I advised what radio what happened,” he says.

“I heard a faint scream and a splash.”

ZACK AND CLAIRE (3:42 p.m.)

Bolan, the prosecutor, getting into the night of Phoebe’s death, asks: “Can you tell the jury what you saw?”

Vickers describes a car overtaking him, fast — he estimated 100 mph. A white Chrysler PT Cruiser.

It was just after midnight.

Manuele is scrolling through a deposition on her laptop. Jonchuck is sitting still, mouth slightly open. The jury listens, the same few taking diligent notes.

Vickers recalls the PT Cruiser suddenly braking, leaving a skid mark on the highway, before driving off at a regular speed toward the approach to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.

Vickers said he called out the tag on the vehicle over his radio.

DERP27, he recalls, referring to his notes to refresh his memory.

The car stopped atop the bridge, Vickers recalls, normally a dangerous place for a traffic stop.

ZACK (3:40 p.m.)

Back in 2015, Vickers said at the time, he wanted to be “prepared to be Phoebe’s voice at trial."" He had talked to a counselor.

""I'm the only witness to a terrible, terrible tragedy,"" he said. ""So I have the responsibility to make sure she gets justice.""

Today he stares at the jury as he runs through his qualifications. This is a standard process, discussing his resume and training, essentially. He’s now a field training officer, as he was at the time of the crime, just in a different district. Back then, he worked 2 p.m. to midnight.

Bolan is leading him through his testimony with questions. Vickers sits below Helinger, who has tissues on the bench next to her microphone.

ZACK AND CLAIRE (3:37 p.m.)

The state calls its first witness.

St. Petersburg police officer William “Drew” Vickers takes the stand in his police blues and glasses. He received an award several months after Phoebe’s death and spoke to the Times about what he saw. Read about that here.

ZACK (3:27 p.m.)

Quick note during the break: Nothing remarkable in the jail logs documenting some of Jonchuck’s activity from the weekend. Received meals, offered a shower, met with a doctor. Jury still not back, but we expect to hear from Officer Vickers after we return.

JOSH AND CLAIRE (3:10 p.m.)

After he was arrested, Manuele tells the jury, Jonchuck went to the North Florida Evaluation and Treatment Center, a state-run mental health facility. He was diagnosed with “a severe and persistent mental illness,” she says. “And at the time of offense, he was experiencing psychosis.”

All witnesses but one state witness can agree on that, she says.

Manuele’s getting to the point where she is addressing evidence she expects the state to present.

If jurors start to hear a lot of evidence about a personality disorder, or Jonchuck’s hard childhood, or how tragic the case is, “I suspect they’re trying to distract you” from the totality of the evidence, she says.

State objects, and there’s a short bench conference. The jury takes advantage of the quick break, standing up, stretching. One man groans, two others share a laugh.

Nobody’s disputing the tragedy, Manuele says. But she warns: “If you feel your heartstrings are being intentionally tugged on, pay attention to that.”

It’ll never make sense, she says. But the best way to explain it is a dream sequence.

“You have a dream where you fly on your pancake to China and you’re met by Bart Simpson, but it’s actually your dad,” Manuele says, the strangest sentence any of us have ever heard spoken in court.

But it’s not your dad. Then the Bart/dad figure asks if you’ve taken your dog out. And you fly back, and you’re concerned you might hit power lines, or an actual airplane.

“That was the most bizarre thing ever. But as you were having that dream, it all made sense,"" Manuele continues.

You can try to explain that dream later, to a coworker, but it doesn’t makes sense, she says. “The pieces are just missing, and you just can’t put it back together.”

You can’t try to make it make sense, Manuele says. And that’s how this case plays out, she continues.

“Mr. Jonchuck is guilty, but insane. He is guilty for dropping for daughter off, but insane.” Which means: not guilty.

She asks the jury to please make that decision. And that’s a wrap.

Short recess before this will continue.

CLAIRE, JOSH AND ZACK (3:03 p.m.)

Manuele jumps forward to the Vickers stop. She’s describing Jonchuck as stone-faced, no reaction when Vickers had him at gunpoint and ordered him back inside the PT Cruiser.

Jonchuck took Phoebe from the car, turned, and let go. In the same calm manner, he got back into the car, she says. When he drove away, it was at a “steady 70 mph.” He pulled a U-turn with his blinker on.

“So was he attempting to evade law enforcement or does he not know what he’s doing?” she asks.

With lights and sirens screaming and his window bashed in, Manuele describes, Jonchuck sat blankly with his hands on the wheel, his seatbelt on.

Manuele describes a hectic scene as officers from several law enforcement agencies descended upon Jonchuck’s vehicle. He was ripped from the car.

“He is in the back of a police car, having just released his daughter of a bridge, and he his asking a police officer if he can have his bible,” Manuele says.

“‘Take me to Babylon,’” she quotes him as saying. “Nonsensical things.”

It’ll be up to the jury to decide if John is in the “here and now” in the video they see of his interview, she explains.

Jonchuck rocks slightly, back and forth. At the prosecution’s table, Ellis and Bolan take notes.

Manuele is back to reading more of Jonchuck’s bizarre statements, this time from his interview after getting apprehended. He asked how Phoebe “was.” Then he asked: “Is she OK?”

She points to that disconnect, among his other ramblings, to say that Jonchuck didn’t understand what was happening.

He asked the officers if he could be let go.

“Certainly, someone who is cognizant would not be asking if he could just be let out of here.”

CLAIRE AND ZACK (2:50 p.m.)

Manuele describes John pacing outside his friend Noemi’s house, holding Phoebe’s hand. He sent Noemi love confessions and bizarre texts of Scripture, she says, despite not being a religious man.

“Unfortunately, you won’t be able to see those text messages either,” Manuele says, because the police chose not to collect them. (Again, she’s trying to sow doubt about the investigation.)

Hard to tell how the jury is taking all of this. The timeline of events being laid out is definitely more disjointed than the state’s straightforward murder narrative.

CLAIRE AND JOSH (2:47 p.m.)

Jonchuck is rocking slightly again as Manuele goes into details of his visit to attorney Genevieve Torres. She quotes Jonchuck’s odd statements from that time, especially about the Swedish bible, with which he had suddenly become obsessed.

This was when, arguably, Jonchuck’s behavior was most erratic, Manuele contends. He called Torres St. Genevieve, then God, then tried to get her to read from the Bible — but she couldn’t read Swedish.

Jonchuck asked Torres if she could keep Phoebe while he went out looking for an exorcism. She said no, and Jonchuck left with his daughter.

But Torres knew: “Something is off. Something is wrong,” Manuele says. “He’s demanding he be baptized today. He’s the Pope. ... It doesn’t make sense.”

When two Hillsborough County deputies met Jonchuck at a church -- called by a concerned Torres -- Jonchuck thought the deputies were there to evaluate his fitness to be a father. Not, as they really were, to conduct a Baker Act evaluation. So Jonchuck answered the questions in such a way as to minimize their concern, according to Manuele. This is the first time we’ve ever heard this perspective on the interaction.

Manuele is straightforwardly recounting Jonchuck’s statements about needing an exorcism, and his march through local churches.

She’s talking slowly, with long pauses.

She mentions odd texts to an estranged uncle about Chinese drywall and Phoebe wailing in the night. Calls to ex-friends. Voicemails telling an old friend she’s possessed by demons. Salt poured around the house, including outside of Phoebe’s room, “to keep the demons away.” (She ruefully notes that the police didn’t take photos, so there’s no evidence of this. Let’s see if this becomes a theme, the defense attacking the thoroughness of the investigation.)

She keeps going, listing “things that just don’t make sense.”

ZACK (2:44 p.m.)

Jonchuck is looking up and at Manuele as she walks through the details of his bizarre behavior in the days before Phoebe’s death. But it’s hard to see his face, obscured by, Jane McNeill, another public defender sitting in the chair next to him.

JOSH, CLAIRE AND ZACK (2:34 p.m.)

Manuele stands closer to the jury than Bolan, directly in front of them. She paces a little as she speaks, motioning with her hands.

At 18, Jonchuck moved in with Kerr, Phoebe’s mom, she explains. And at 21, he sought mental health treatment again. He couldn’t hold a job, Manuele says. He couldn’t control his emotions. He was diagnosed with ADD and bipolar disorder.

He was prescribed a litany of medications. Manuele rattles them off, more than a half dozen. He experimented with different combinations to try to find one that worked, she says. In 2013, Jonchuck stopped seeing his doctor, and began rationing his meds to get them to last longer, his lawyer explains.

Both Jonchuck and Kerr had mental health issues, Manuele says. The relationship was tumultuous. “Nobody will deny that.""

She adds: “One thing is certain: he loved Phoebe more than anything. There is nobody who will tell you that’s not the case.”

Prosecutors contend he killed Phoebe to punish Kerr. Not the case, Manuele says. For one thing, she explains, Kerr didn’t try particularly hard to fight for custody; a lackadaisical approach to parenthood shows as much.

“So what caused the psychotic break?” she asks. “Because there was a break with reality. Something happened.”

Manuele brings up the Thanksgiving dinner Jonchuck attended with Phoebe; Kerr; Kerr’s fiance, named Guy Kisser; and Jonchuck’s mom. Kisser noticed Jonchuck was outside talking to himself.

Bolan, in his opening for the state, also brought up the Thanksgiving meal. He painted it as a turning point, when Jonchuck met Kisser.

Manuele is walking through Jonchuck’s supposed psychotic break, pointing to erratic handwriting, anxiety that ramps up at night. If it doesn’t make sense, she says, that’s because it never will. Because it’s insanity.

ZACK (2:28 p.m.)

Still a handful of people seeming to watch the trial from the audience. They are quiet, not moving, watching Manuele intently.

A deputy sits by the door, one of three in the room. Another sits next to the jury, and one behind Jonchuck.

Judge Chris Helinger presses her fingers to her lips as she listens to the defense’s opening statement.

CLAIRE (2:25 p.m.)

The defense doesn’t pull punches. Assistant Public Defender Jessica Manuele begins by saying what happened that night was tragic. Jonchuck took his daughter, whom he loved more than anybody in the world, and dropped her off of the side of the Dick Misener bridge.

“It didn’t make sense at the time. It doesn’t make sense today. It will never make sense. Because it is insanity.”

Manuele calls him Mr. Jonchuck. He’s a victim here. As a small child, from five years old, until age 14, he went to USF to get treatment for something to do with his psychiatric state, Manuele says. He had counseling and medications. But his family can’t tell you his diagnosis, who cared for him. It wasn’t the priority.

She’s pacing, hands knit. “From a very young age, John was treated as a hot potato.” From mom to dad, to uncles, to dad again, John gets “dumped.”

Same as earlier, jurors sit with straight faces. A few keep up the note-taking. Jonchuck is bouncing very slightly in his chair.

JOSH AND CLAIRE (2:20 p.m.)

When Jonchuck was held in an interview room at the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office after his arrest, there were cameras. Jonchuck said some things that may seem peculiar, Bolan says, but he was in the “here and now.”

Bolan keeps repeating those words. Jonchuck was, Bolan says, in the here and now. What matters is that Jonchuck knew why he was there, Bolan is saying.

Bolan brings up Melody Dishman, a friend of Jonchuck’s. In previous Timesreporting, Dishman said that Jonchuck had told her that if he ever got into big trouble, he would claim insanity.

Before Bolan can say anything beyond Dishman’s name, the defense objects. The judge has all five attorneys — three for the defense and two for the state — up for a bench conference to work out the disagreement.

During this brief break, jurors stretch and yawn, make small talk, chug water. Two use the time to catch up on notes.

After the bench conference, Bolan says there are witnesses who will explain that Jonchuck felt he and Phoebe needed to both die to prevent everybody from going to hell. The jury will note, Bolan says, that only one person went over the railing that day.

“You will see that John Jonchuck committed this murder to punish his own mother and the mother of Phoebe Jonchuck,” Bolan says. “He told his mother before the murder that he would ‘f--- up the rest of her life,’ and he made good on that promise.”

Phoebe was a light to her, a reason to be a better person and loving grandmother.

Jonchuck was sane, Bolan says. He did it. Now hold him responsible.

“There is only one verdict that is true in this case,"" the prosecutor argues. Guilty of first-degree murder.

With that, Bolan completes his opening statement.

ZACK (2:18 p.m.)

Bolan is describing a vengeance killing.

“You will see that the defendant John Jonchuck Jr. committed this murder to punish his mother and the mother of Phoebe Jonchuck,” he says.

Behind him, Jonchuck stares at the prosecutor, blinking but otherwise still.

ZACK (2:12 p.m.)

Jonchuck is back to looking down as Bolan talks about the hours before Phoebe died, when he met with a priest, asking to be baptized. He circled through several churches in Hillsborough County.

He had a dinner of scrambled eggs, breakfast for supper, made by his father.

He told his mother he would take Phoebe to school the next day, Bolan says.

He emailed his attorney, saying his mom would drop off a payment.

Jonchuck is rocking side to side in the courtroom, almost shimmying in his seat.

Prosecutors believe he left his father’s house for the last time about 10:30 p.m.

Jonchuck looks up. His attorneys whisper to each other. He stares at Bolan in the middle of the courtroom.

It has been more than 1,500 days since that night.

JOSH AND CLAIRE (2:10 p.m.)

Bolan says maybe Jonchuck’s behavior makes him look crazy.

“But the word crazy is not the jury instructions,” Bolan said. “It’s not the law.”

The hours before Jonchuck dropped his daughter, his custody lawyer, Genevieve Torres, called 911 concerned for Phoebe. Two Hillsborough deputies said Jonchuck didn’t meet the requirements for the Baker Act, which allows law enforcement officers to take people into involuntary medical custody if they are deemed a threat to themselves or others.

“We have a man here who’s not psychotic. He knows what’s going on. He’s in the here and now.”

CLAIRE (2:05 p.m.)

At the time Jonchuck fills out a custody petition with attorney Genevieve Torres, nothing seems wrong, Bolan says. No mental health boxes get checked.

Sure, Jonchuck said some things that might sound pretty weird, Bolan says. But Jonchuck said one thing to the lawyer that Bolan thinks the jury should note. “None of this will matter anymore.”

JOSH (2:04 p.m.)

I wasn’t expecting Bolan to get into Jonchuck’s life before Phoebe’s death. I anticipated the prosecution would focus on the incident and the immediate aftermath. But Bolan is telling the jury that Jonchuck did not suffer from mental illness before the incident, and that Phoebe was at the center of a custody dispute. It sounds like he’s touching on potential motive to kill Phoebe.

Jonchuck and Phoebe’s mother, Michelle Kerr, had split up. In the months before Phoebe died, Kerr began dating a new man. There were angry texts between the two of them.

“Things are simmering with this defendant because he sees the likelihood that he’s about to lose this child,” Bolan says.

ZACK (2:01 p.m.)

As Bolan continues his statements, he repeatedly refers to Jonchuck by name.

“The man sitting here, John Jonchuck Jr.. committed this murder of his daughter, Phoebe Jonchuck,” the prosecutor says, bluntly.

Jonchuck rubs his head, resting his chin in his left palm, fingers just below his temple.

JOSH AND CLAIRE (1:55 p.m.)

Now Bolan is running down the list of crimes with which the jury could convict Jonchuck. Of course, there’s first-degree murder, which is the charge Jonchuck faces. Now Bolan is explaining felony murder, which is the when somebody dies during the commission of a crime. The crime, Bolan explained, was aggravated child abuse.

Next Bolan touches on insanity. That’s what the defense will argue, that Jonchuck was insane at the time of the crime. It’s the defense’s burden to prove insanity, he reminds the jury.

The definition of insanity is important, Bolan says. Someone isn’t insane just because they have a mental illness. Or just because they say something that sounds strange. Under the definition, Bolan says, Jonchuck would have had to not know what he was doing, or to not know it was wrong.

The evidence, Bolan says, will show Jonchuck knew what he was doing. And that he knew it was wrong. And therefore, the prosecutor says, the jury will have to find Jonchuck was not insane.

That’s the burden, Bolan says, the defense must meet.

He knew what he did, Bolan says. He knew he killed his child, so he ran.

It would be easy to say he was insane. But look deeper, “beyond the superficial,” Bolan says.

CLAIRE AND JOSH (1:52 p.m.)

Premeditation. The decision has to be present in the mind at the time of the killing, Bolan says, walking through the definition. At least three jurors are taking notes. One squints hard, leaning forward, before turning back to his notepad.

There is no set time, Bolan explained, for premeditation. The law doesn’t require a certain amount of time passes between the idea to kill and the killing. There simply has to be enough time to reflect

“The facts of this case will prove the defendant had time to reflect,” Bolan said.

CLAIRE AND JOSH (1:49 p.m.)

Again Bolan points at Jonchuck.

After tossing Phoebe, he decided to go back toward Tampa, where he had come from, the prosecutor says. Bolan’s point: That moment of decision matters.

Jonchuck didn’t stop, “desperate to get away,” Bolan says, despite lights and sirens blazing. He made a U-turn, sending a police officer swerving out of the way. Jonchuck was speeding the wrong way down the highway, with police officers in pursuit.

The officers, at some point, crossed back over to I-75 going the right direction. But Jonchuck kept driving south in the northbound lanes.

At this point, Bolan tells the jury, St. Petersburg police were joined by the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office and the Florida Highway Patrol.

It ultimately took road spikes to shatter Jonchuck’s tires and bring him to a stop.

Jonchuck has his hands in front of his eyes. He’s not moving.

Bolan delivers a punchline to the jury. After Jonchuck stopped driving, he wouldn’t obey orders to unlock his door. Officers had to break the window. But they still struggled to get him out. Why?

“Because after all that he had done, he still buckled his seat belt for safety,” Bolan says, following with a long pause.

CLAIRE AND JOSH (1:45 p.m.)

Next, Bolan pivots to the Eckerd College students, who have a rescue team and were activated to look for Phoebe. They found her body, pulled her into their boat. The students met a fire department crew, and Vickers, who was on that boat, administered CPR. Phoebe was beyond help.

“It’s no use at this point. She is dead,” Bolan says. “She is cold to the touch. She’s not breathing. There’s no pulse. They never ever have any signs of life.”

The juror in red, who was fidgeting earlier, covers her mouth with her hand.

The details are horrific. Frothy liquid in the lungs. Bruises on her back. Bolan warns that the pictures will be hard to stomach.

JOSH AND CLAIRE (1:40 p.m.)

All Vickers sees in the water is blackness, Bolan says. He never sees the girl.

He climbs down a ladder looking for Phoebe, shining his flashlight on the water from a catwalk below the bridge.

He radios what happened.

“At this point,” Bolan says, “police officers all over St. Petersburg know what just happened, that a man threw a child off the bridge.”

A few jurors are taking notes. One woman in red fidgets as Bolan walks through the details of Phoebe’s body lost in the water. Most are still, though, listening. Jonchuck’s hands are pulling down on his face as he sits, looking down.

“Eventually, she is found, about 90 minutes later” in the water of Tampa Bay, Bolan says. Her body has drifted east.

ZACK (1:39 p.m.)

Jonchuck stares down as Bolan speaks, describing a play-by-play of the night Phoebe died.

“You have no free will,” Bolan says, quoting what the police officer remembers Jonchuck saying atop the bridge. In the courtroom, Jonchuck does not look up.

“His gun is at the ready. He’s been trained for this moment,” Bolan says, explaining the tension of that night atop the bridge. Jonchuck lifts his head and rocks slightly, back and forth in his seat.

“Five-year-old blond-haired little girl,” Bolan says. “Named Phoebe.”

Jonchuck raises his hands, covering his eyes.

“The officer heard her scream on her way down.”

Jonchuck pulls his fingers over his mouth.

“He flees,” the prosecutor says.

Jonchuck’s eyes are closed.

“He has effectively murdered his child in that moment,” Bolan explains. Jonchuck raises his fingers to his cheeks, cradling his chin in his hands.

CLAIRE, JOSH AND ZACK (1:37 p.m.)

Prosecutor Paul Bolan gives the opening statement for the prosecution. He starts by telling the jury the perspective of St. Petersburg police officer William “Drew” Vickers, who was on his way home Jan. 8, 2015, approaching the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, when he saw a white Chrysler PT Cruiser.

“He put in a long day, and he was going home his normal route,” Bolan says.

The prosecutor points at the witness stand. Vickers will be there soon. Bolan promises that Vickers will tell them about the gusting wind, the choppy waters. The white PT cruiser speeding wildly down the highway.

The jury listens. Some have their chins tilted back, appraising. One white-haired man listens with his hand on his chin.

Vickers had not activated his lights or sirens. He pulled behind the PT Cruiser as it came to a stop atop the Dick Misener Bridge, on the approach to the Skyway.

Then, Bolan says , Jonchuck got out of the car. Vickers didn’t know what to expect, but feared a confrontation. He drew his gun.

Jonchuck said to the officer: “You have no free will.” Then he walked to the passenger side of his car and reached in. Vickers expected to see a gun.

Instead, Jonchuck lifted out a child.

“A 5-year-old, blonde-haired, little girl,” Bolan says. ""Named Phoebe.”

Jonchuck turned, the prosecutor explained, and he let go of the little girl.

Vickers heard her scream. Then Jonchuck drove off.

Faces in the jury seats are impassive. They’re watching Bolan, who’s talking with his hands, pacing as he walks through the minutes of that night.

“He knows, not only that he committed this crime, but that an officer saw it. So he can’t wait.”

ZACK (1:27 p.m.)

Jonchuck continues staring straight at the bench, completely still, not looking at the jury as Helinger instructs them on the trial process.

“Your verdict must based solely on the evidence or lack of evidence,” the judge says, as the deputy behind Jonchuck leans back in his chair. The prosecutors and defense wait.

Along the wall of the courtroom, a TV videographer points his camera at the judge.

CLAIRE AND JOSH (1:25 p.m.)

Here comes the jury. At first glance, mostly white, mostly middle-aged or older. They take their seats in three rows at the left side of the courtroom and look around.

Was anybody exposed to news about the trial? Helinger asks. Media, radio, your friends? Instagram, or whatever it’s called?

All shake their heads no. Right hands go up.

Helinger reads them the jury instructions. Jonchuck is charged with murder, she says, but the indictment she read them last week during jury selection is not evidence. Then, she explains how the trial is conducted. First, the opening statements. That is just a framework and is not evidence. Then, witnesses are called to testify under oath, along with documents or other evidence that may be presented. Then, there are closing arguments.

After that, they will retired to the jury room to consider their verdict, which should be based solely on the evidence. They are not to make up their minds until all the evidence is presented.

Next, the judge addresses publicity and communication about the case. Jurors are not to talk about the case or look up any information about the case.

The jury is made up of nine men and seven women. All eyes seem to be on the judge.

ZACK (1:19 p.m.)

Jonchuck is staring straight ahead at the bench, not looking over to the prosecutors as they speak. The courtroom is set up with the Doug Ellis and Paul Bolan, assistant state attorneys, at a table to the left, and Jonchuck to the right, seated next to public defenders Jessica Manuele, Greg Williams and Jane McNeill. There’s a deputy in green seated just over Jonchuck’s right shoulder. There are about eight people in the audience who are not members of the media, unclear their connection to the case at this point.

JOSH AND CLAIRE (1:18 p.m.)

A few items before openings begin:

First, both sides signed paperwork to stipulate that Phoebe is the victim in this case.

Next, today the defense filed two motions to exclude testimony. The first relates to any evidence that Phoebe was afraid of water and that she couldn’t swim.

Paul Bolan, a prosecutor, argues those details are extremely relevant and go toward intent, which, he points out, the defense made clear during selection that the state has the responsibility to prove.

The judge denies the motion.

“I think that’s relevant as to the motive and intent, and it’s also relevant as to whether she would be able to survive,” says Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Chris Helinger. “Because people who are afraid of the water don’t do as well.”

The second motion to exclude asks the state to follow evidence rules. The defense doesn’t want testimony about his propensity to commit crime or his prior criminal record. They also don’t want any reference to Jonchuck’s drug use, except where they might have played a role in Phoebe’s death.

“It’s gonna be kind of weird, though, are they just not going to talk about drugs at all?” Judge Helinger says.

“What we’re trying to keep from happening is these doctors saying, ‘When he was 16, he was high on coke.’ ... Well, so what?,” defense attorney Greg Williams says. “We can’t unring that bell.”

One last thing before the jurors are called in: the judge asked the defense if they would like her to reread Jonchuck’s right to remain silent in front of the jurors. The thinking is, if he chooses not to testify, the jurors shouldn’t hold that against him.

JOSH (1:05 p.m.)

The judge says hello to Jonchuck when he walked into the courtroom Monday afternoon.

“Good afternoon Mr. Jonchuck.,” she says.

“Good morning, Your Honor,” he responds.

“We’re past that,” the judge says in reply.”

“Oh, sorry,” he says, chuckling.

ZACK (12:57 p.m.)

We’re in session, but the jury is not yet in the room. Sgt. Kenneth Miller, formerly a detective from the St. Petersburg Police Department, hauled one box full of evidence into the courthouse this afternoon. It is full of potential exhibits for the trial.

Miller was one of the lead investigators on the homicide investigation into Phoebe’s death.

Jonchuck entered the courtroom at 12:59 p.m. wearing a green shirt and a tie.

He said good morning to Judge Chris Helinger.

“We’re past that, we’re in the afternoon,"" she said.

“Oh, sorry,” Jonchuck replied.

JOSH (10:30 a.m.)

Good morning. Opening statements are set to begin this afternoon. Here’s some analysis on what we can expect:

The prosecution will likely focus on the facts of Phoebe’s death and the immediate aftermath. That means the scene on the bridge when Jonchuck dropped Phoebe in front of a St. Petersburg police officer, the pursuit down Interstate 75 to capture Jonchuck and the recovery of Phoebe’s body in Tampa Bay. It’s not necessarily to the state’s advantage to address insanity, except to remind jurors that the defense has the burden of proving Jonchuck was insane at the time.

The pursuit could prove to be critical. For the jury to find that Jonchuck is not guilty by reason of insanity, jurors will need to believe Jonchuck didn’t know what he was doing when he let his daughter go, or didn’t know it was wrong to do so. Fleeing from police could be construed as a sign he knew what he did was wrong.

The defense already said during jury selection last week that they do not plan to dispute Jonchuck was the man behind Phoebe’s death. The public defenders during their opening statements will likely shed light on Jonchuck’s erratic behavior in the weeks, days and hours before Phoebe’s death to try to establish that Jonchuck’s mental health had deteriorated in hopes the jury find him not guilty by reason of insanity.

Also, public defender Jane McNeill made sure prospective jurors understood that to convict Jonchuck of first-degree murder, the state has the burden of proving premeditation. It could be the defense will push for a lesser conviction. It sounds like they may say the jury should find Jonchuck not guilty, but if it does convict him, it should be for second-degree murder, not first-degree.

It took all week, but they finally picked a jury: nine men and seven women.

With the tedious part over, the murder trial of John Jonchuck - accused of dropping his 5-year-old daughter, Phoebe, off a bridge in 2015 - can now begin. Opening statements are set for 1 p.m. today.

The prosecutors will go first. It’s their job to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Jonchuck is guilty of premeditated murder. Then the defense will go. Jonchuck’s attorneys have already said they will not contest that Jonchuck did it. However, they will argue he was insane at the time, and therefore should be found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Then the prosecution will begin calling witnesses.",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190325/john-jonchuck-trial-begins-with-competing-narratives-over-vengeance-and-insanity?rssfeed=true,2019-03-26T06:03:57Z,News Chief,Couple,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881
1334,"John Jonchuck trial: Opening statements underway for father accused of dropping 5-year-old daughter Phoebe off bridge, into Tampa Bay","Opening statements got underway Monday in the murder trial of a man accused of throwing his 5-year-old daughter Phoebe off a Tampa Bay area bridge as a police officer watched helplessly.

CLAIRE (2:05 p.m.)

At the time Jonchuck fills out a custody petition with attorney Genevieve Torres, nothing seems wrong, Bolan says. No mental health boxes get checked.

The evidence, Bolan says, will show Jonchuck knew what he was doing. And that he knew it was wrong. And therefore, the prosecutor says, the jury will have to find Jonchuck was not insane.

That’s the burden, Bolan says, the defense must meet.

He knew what he did, Bolan says. He knew he killed his child, so he ran.

It would be easy to say he was insane. But look deeper, “beyond the superficial,” Bolan says.

CLAIRE AND JOSH (1:52 p.m.)

Premeditation. The decision has to be present in the mind at the time of the killing, Bolan says, walking through the definition. At least three jurors are taking notes. One squints hard, leaning forward, before turning back to his notepad.

There is no set time, Bolan explained, for premeditation. The law doesn’t require a certain amount of time passes between the idea to kill and the killing. There simply has to be enough time to reflect

“The facts of this case will prove the defendant had time to reflect,” Bolan said.

CLAIRE AND JOSH (1:49 p.m.)

Again Bolan points at Jonchuck.

After tossing Phoebe, he decided to go back toward Tampa, where he had come from, the prosecutor says. Bolan’s point: That moment of decision matters.

Jonchuck didn’t stop, “desperate to get away,” Bolan says, despite lights and sirens blazing. He made a U-turn, sending a police officer swerving out of the way. Jonchuck was speeding the wrong way down the highway, with police officers in pursuit.

The officers, at some point, crossed back over to I-75 going the right direction. But Jonchuck kept driving south in the northbound lanes.

At this point, Bolan tells the jury, St. Petersburg police were joined by the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office and the Florida Highway Patrol.

It ultimately took road spikes to shatter Jonchuck’s tires and bring him to a stop.

Jonchuck has his hands in front of his eyes. He’s not moving.

Bolan delivers a punchline to the jury. After Jonchuck stopped driving, he wouldn’t obey orders to unlock his door. Officers had to break the window. But they still struggled to get him out. Why?

“Because after all that he had done, he still buckled his seat belt for safety,” Bolan says, following with a long pause.

CLAIRE AND JOSH (1:45 p.m.)

Next, Bolan pivots to the Eckerd College students, who have a rescue team and were activated to look for Phoebe. They found her body, pulled her into their boat. The students met a fire department crew, and Vickers, who was on that boat, administered CPR. Phoebe was beyond help.

“It’s no use at this point. She is dead,” Bolan says. “She is cold to the touch. She’s not breathing. There’s no pulse. They never ever have any signs of life.”

The juror in red, who was fidgeting earlier, covers her mouth with her hand.

The details are horrific. Frothy liquid in the lungs. Bruises on her back. Bolan warns that the pictures will be hard to stomach.

JOSH AND CLAIRE (1:40 p.m.)

All Vickers sees in the water is blackness, Bolan says. He never sees the girl.

He climbs down a ladder looking for Phoebe, shining his flashlight on the water from a catwalk below the bridge.

He radios what happened.

“At this point,” Bolan says, “police officers all over St. Petersburg know what just happened, that a man threw a child off the bridge.”

A few jurors are taking notes. One woman in red fidgets as Bolan walks through the details of Phoebe’s body lost in the water. Most are still, though, listening. Jonchuck’s hands are pulling down on his face as he sits, looking down.

“Eventually, she is found, about 90 minutes later” in the water of Tampa Bay, Bolan says. Her body has drifted east.

ZACK (1:39 p.m.)

Jonchuck stares down as Bolan speaks, describing a play-by-play of the night Phoebe died.

“You have no free will,” Bolan says, quoting what the police officer remembers Jonchuck saying atop the bridge. In the courtroom, Jonchuck does not look up.

“His gun is at the ready. He’s been trained for this moment,” Bolan says, explaining the tension of that night atop the bridge. Jonchuck lifts his head and rocks slightly, back and forth in his seat.

“Five-year-old blond-haired little girl,” Bolan says. “Named Phoebe.”

Jonchuck raises his hands, covering his eyes.

“The officer heard her scream on her way down.”

Jonchuck pulls his fingers over his mouth.

“He flees,” the prosecutor says.

Jonchuck’s eyes are closed.

“He has effectively murdered his child in that moment,” Bolan explains. Jonchuck raises his fingers to his cheeks, cradling his chin in his hands.

CLAIRE, JOSH AND ZACK (1:37 p.m.)

Prosecutor Paul Bolan gives the opening statement for the prosecution. He starts by telling the jury the perspective of St. Petersburg police officer William “Drew” Vickers, who was on his way home Jan. 8, 2015, approaching the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, when he saw a white Chrysler PT Cruiser.

“He put in a long day, and he was going home his normal route,” Bolan says.

The prosecutor points at the witness stand. Vickers will be there soon. Bolan promises that Vickers will tell them about the gusting wind, the choppy waters. The white PT cruiser speeding wildly down the highway.

The jury listens. Some have their chins tilted back, appraising. One white-haired man listens with his hand on his chin.

Vickers had not activated his lights or sirens. He pulled behind the PT Cruiser as it came to a stop atop the Dick Misener Bridge, on the approach to the Skyway.

Then, Bolan says , Jonchuck got out of the car. Vickers didn’t know what to expect, but feared a confrontation. He drew his gun.

Jonchuck said to the officer: “You have no free will.” Then he walked to the passenger side of his car and reached in. Vickers expected to see a gun.

Instead, Jonchuck lifted out a child.

“A 5-year-old, blonde-haired, little girl,” Bolan says. ""Named Phoebe.”

Jonchuck turned, the prosecutor explained, and he let go of the little girl.

Vickers heard her scream. Then Jonchuck drove off.

Faces in the jury seats are impassive. They’re watching Bolan, who’s talking with his hands, pacing as he walks through the minutes of that night.

“He knows, not only that he committed this crime, but that an officer saw it. So he can’t wait.”

ZACK (1:27 p.m.)

Jonchuck continues staring straight at the bench, completely still, not looking at the jury as Helinger instructs them on the trial process.

“Your verdict must based solely on the evidence or lack of evidence,” the judge says, as the deputy behind Jonchuck leans back in his chair. The prosecutors and defense wait.

Along the wall of the courtroom, a TV videographer points his camera at the judge.

CLAIRE AND JOSH (1:25 p.m.)

Here comes the jury. At first glance, mostly white, mostly middle-aged or older. They take their seats in three rows at the left side of the courtroom and look around.

Was anybody exposed to news about the trial? Helinger asks. Media, radio, your friends? Instagram, or whatever it’s called?

All shake their heads no. Right hands go up.

Helinger reads them the jury instructions. Jonchuck is charged with murder, she says, but the indictment she read them last week during jury selection is not evidence. Then, she explains how the trial is conducted. First, the opening statements. That is just a framework and is not evidence. Then, witnesses are called to testify under oath, along with documents or other evidence that may be presented. Then, there are closing arguments.

After that, they will retired to the jury room to consider their verdict, which should be based solely on the evidence. They are not to make up their minds until all the evidence is presented.

Next, the judge addresses publicity and communication about the case. Jurors are not to talk about the case or look up any information about the case.

The jury is made up of nine men and seven women. All eyes seem to be on the judge.

ZACK (1:19 p.m.)

Jonchuck is staring straight ahead at the bench, not looking over to the prosecutors as they speak. The courtroom is set up with the Doug Ellis and Paul Bolan, assistant state attorneys, at a table to the left, and Jonchuck to the right, seated next to public defenders Jessica Manuele, Greg Williams and Jane McNeill. There’s a deputy in green seated just over Jonchuck’s right shoulder. There are about eight people in the audience who are not members of the media, unclear their connection to the case at this point.

JOSH AND CLAIRE (1:18 p.m.)

A few items before openings begin:

First, both sides signed paperwork to stipulate that Phoebe is the victim in this case.

Next, today the defense filed two motions to exclude testimony. The first relates to any evidence that Phoebe was afraid of water and that she couldn’t swim.

Paul Bolan, a prosecutor, argues those details are extremely relevant and go toward intent, which, he points out, the defense made clear during selection that the state has the responsibility to prove.

The judge denies the motion.

“I think that’s relevant as to the motive and intent, and it’s also relevant as to whether she would be able to survive,” says Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Chris Helinger. “Because people who are afraid of the water don’t do as well.”

The second motion to exclude asks the state to follow evidence rules. The defense doesn’t want testimony about his propensity to commit crime or his prior criminal record. They also don’t want any reference to Jonchuck’s drug use, except where they might have played a role in Phoebe’s death.

“It’s gonna be kind of weird, though, are they just not going to talk about drugs at all?” Judge Helinger says.

“What we’re trying to keep from happening is these doctors saying, ‘When he was 16, he was high on coke.’ ... Well, so what?,” defense attorney Greg Williams says. “We can’t unring that bell.”

One last thing before the jurors are called in: the judge asked the defense if they would like her to reread Jonchuck’s right to remain silent in front of the jurors. The thinking is, if he chooses not to testify, the jurors shouldn’t hold that against him.

JOSH (1:05 p.m.)

The judge says hello to Jonchuck when he walked into the courtroom Monday afternoon.

“Good afternoon Mr. Jonchuck.,” she says.

“Good morning, Your Honor,” he responds.

“We’re past that,” the judge says in reply.”

“Oh, sorry,” he says, chuckling.

ZACK (12:57 p.m.)

We’re in session, but the jury is not yet in the room. Sgt. Kenneth Miller, formerly a detective from the St. Petersburg Police Department, hauled one box full of evidence into the courthouse this afternoon. It is full of potential exhibits for the trial.

Miller was one of the lead investigators on the homicide investigation into Phoebe’s death.

Jonchuck entered the courtroom at 12:59 p.m. wearing a green shirt and a tie.

He said good morning to Judge Chris Helinger.

“We’re past that, we’re in the afternoon,"" she said.

“Oh, sorry,” Jonchuck replied.

JOSH (10:30 a.m.)

Good morning. Opening statements are set to begin this afternoon. Here’s some analysis on what we can expect:

The prosecution will likely focus on the facts of Phoebe’s death and the immediate aftermath. That means the scene on the bridge when Jonchuck dropped Phoebe in front of a St. Petersburg police officer, the pursuit down Interstate 75 to capture Jonchuck and the recovery of Phoebe’s body in Tampa Bay. It’s not necessarily to the state’s advantage to address insanity, except to remind jurors that the defense has the burden of proving Jonchuck was insane at the time.

The pursuit could prove to be critical. For the jury to find that Jonchuck is not guilty by reason of insanity, jurors will need to believe Jonchuck didn’t know what he was doing when he let his daughter go, or didn’t know it was wrong to do so. Fleeing from police could be construed as a sign he knew what he did was wrong.

The defense already said during jury selection last week that they do not plan to dispute Jonchuck was the man behind Phoebe’s death. The public defenders during their opening statements will likely shed light on Jonchuck’s erratic behavior in the weeks, days and hours before Phoebe’s death to try to establish that Jonchuck’s mental health had deteriorated in hopes the jury find him not guilty by reason of insanity.

Also, public defender Jane McNeill made sure prospective jurors understood that to convict Jonchuck of first-degree murder, the state has the burden of proving premeditation. It could be the defense will push for a lesser conviction. It sounds like they may say the jury should find Jonchuck not guilty, but if it does convict him, it should be for second-degree murder, not first-degree.

It took all week, but they finally picked a jury: nine men and seven women.

With the tedious part over, the murder trial of John Jonchuck - accused of dropping his 5-year-old daughter, Phoebe, off a bridge in 2015 - can now begin. Opening statements are set for 1 p.m. today.

The prosecutors will go first. It’s their job to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Jonchuck is guilty of premeditated murder. Then the defense will go. Jonchuck’s attorneys have already said they will not contest that Jonchuck did it. However, they will argue he was insane at the time, and therefore should be found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Then the prosecution will begin calling witnesses.",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190325/john-jonchuck-trial-opening-statements-underway-for-father-accused-of-dropping-5-year-old-daughter-phoebe-off-bridge-into-tampa-bay?rssfeed=true,2019-03-25T12:40:04Z,News Chief,Couple,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881

He was holding an 8-month-old girl, the daughter of a family friend, as he watched Melbourne police officers stroll along the street, unraveling crime scene tape to mark off another shooting site in his neighborhood.

This time, police said, someone in a vehicle sprayed nearly a dozen gunshots toward another vehicle near Stone Middle School just before students were allowed to leave for the day March 4

In that shooting, two women received non-life-threatening injuries and police are seeking Michael Postell, 40, on aggravated assault and other felony charges. A warrant has been issued for his arrest.

More: 2 people shot near middle school

The shooting again raised a lingering concern about tackling such episodes in a neighborhood that has fought over the years to meet the physical and spiritual needs of its children and residents through outreach programs and ministries.

""It's just happened so many times, I'm just kind of numb to it now,"" Elkins said, a short time after police sirens screamed their arrival. ""People don't really care.""

What Elkins calls home, Melbourne Police Department officials dub as Area 9, a swath of working-class neighborhood that includes Stone Middle School, the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library, numerous congregations, and community centers.

Aside from the often quiet scenes of families enjoying themselves, teens shooting hoops or friends munching on sandwiches at Lipscomb Street Park, police and homeowners also know it as an area that falls prey to crime.

Over the last two years, there have been 125 instances of gunshots reported by residents. Well over 200 aggravated assaults have been reported in that time frame.

Last week, police were investigating what was seen in a social media video making the rounds: a man stepping out of a convenience store off University Boulevard randomly cold-cocked by a man waiting outside.

(Photo: MALCOLM DENEMARK/FLORIDA TODAY)

In a neighborhood where children are taught to read at Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church and where teachers share creative skills at Club Esteem, residents worry over what more can be done to stop such acts of violence.

Change needed

Crimes, such as the Easter day shooting in 2017 that left three injured after 80 bullets were fired at Lipscomb Street Park and when 50 shots were fired at Lizzy's Restaurant in retaliation for a February 2018 stabbing, have left residents like Elkins wanting change.

Over the years, there have been homicides — including 21-year-old former Palm Bay High football star Twonnie Pollard — and several prayer rallies afterward in South Melbourne.

More:Twonnie Pollard dies after shooting

The drug trade can be the source of much of the violence and shootings, said Cmdr. Marcus Claycomb of the Melbourne Police Department.

Disputes over drugs, money and strained relationships can escalate quickly, prompting a need to connect addicts with services. Melbourne officers are trained to help people get in touch with services through the Sharing Center and 211 Brevard, he said.

Buy Photo The area around University Blvd. has seen many violent crimes through the years. Melbourne Police Commander Marc Claycomb talks about past and current crime in south Melbourne, and the police and community efforts that are making a difference. (Photo: TIM SHORTT/ FLORIDA TODAY)

""The more we can help them on the front end of that addiction, the more we help them in the long term, and the more it helps us as well,"" Claycomb said. ""The threat of drugs in the neighborhood is a part of the foundation of quite a few problems we deal with on both the criminal side and the quality of life side in the neighborhood.""

Finding hope

Foster B. Thayer, a retired teacher who started his career at Stone Middle School, has lived in the neighborhood for nearly 50 years and has seen success rise from some desperate situations that intersected with poverty.

More than additional programs or police patrols, he said the neighborhood children need guidance and role models.

""I was that kid at that time, so in some ways, I can relate,"" said Thayer, whose father was a Melbourne police lieutenant who patrolled the area. ""A lot of these kids today are sharp, but you have to let them know, you have to show them that there's a better way to look at life.""

Buy Photo University Blvd. south Melbourne, where police and community efforts are making a difference in cutting down on crime. (Photo: TIM SHORTT/ FLORIDA TODAY)

To do that, he said, people are needed who are committed to helping these children and teens think about themselves differently.

""It's not something that can happen overnight,"" he said.

Thayer is one of those people: he mentors youth and volunteers to help neighborhood children in a robotics program held at Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church on Lipscomb Street.

More: Evans Center grand opening

Others in the neighborhood point to after-school programs like Club Esteem and Connecting Children with Reading, that focus on bolstering academic skills and literacy in youth.

There's the newly opened $1.5 million Evans Center, a neighborhood market that houses a job training facility and a clinic run by Brevard Health Alliance.

And there are events such as an annual Thanksgiving meal at Lipscomb Community Center that draws hundreds, said Sandra Pelham, a neighborhood fixture and longtime community organizer. She's been gearing up to help with the Read and Feed program that provides food for children in need.

Residents, many of whom grew up with each other, remain close-knit, she said.

""Things have gotten better in many ways, but the (violence) hasn't stopped,"" she said. ""There are more guns out there. We need to ask how we are going to solve this problem.""

SPEAK OUT

Looking beyond the social programs, Melbourne Police Department officials are hoping for more cooperation from residents in helping with investigations.

People need to step up to help stop the gun violence and call out those who prey on victims in the neighborhood, police said.

The Melbourne Police Department has a great relationship with the community, but needs to increase trust so residents will come forward with concerns, said Claycomb.

""The police department — and I don't care which police department it is — cannot do its job without the cooperation of the community,"" Claycomb said.

His agency has a number of unsolved homicides pinned to the south Melbourne neighborhood, some going back over a decade.

""It's the residents and the business owners working with us for the same common goals,"" he said.

The increasing community outreach helps build trust, said Claycomb.

Melbourne police have sent representatives to community events, rallies and marches. Palm Bay police, whose jurisdictional line begins at Lipscomb Street, also assist with funding programs, reading to neighborhood children and attending meetings.

THINKING FORWARD

Melbourne community response police officers are assigned to outreach programs, working with residents and business owners like Anthony Bergman, the 29-year-old co-owner of Lizzy's Restaurant on University Boulevard.

The iconic restaurant, which has provided everything from hot wings to chitterlings for more than two decades, sits along one of the busier spots along the boulevard.

Standing in front of it, a resident can point out where homicides or any number of shootings and attacks on police officers have taken place, just yards away.

""You've got 8,000 people in a 2-square-mile area,"" said Bergman. ""When one or two people do something bad, it reflects on the whole area.""

Owners of the restaurant have talked to the neighborhood kids and allowed peace rallies on the property, all in hopes of quelling the violence.

""I might talk to somebody personally, talk to kids personally about different situations that arise,"" Bergman said.

For now, though, Bergman doesn't see an end in sight to the sporadic violence.

But for Elkins, the latest shooting may have been too much.

""I just pray for the best, man. It's too close to home,"" he said.

No arrests had been made in the Stone Middle School shooting, but police were interviewing witnesses and victims in the case.

There are still many residents like Pelham who continue to talk about hope for the future.

""Our neighborhood is still up and rising. You have had so much good come out of here,"" she said.

""Yes, it gets frustrating, but again, looking at the world as a whole. This is going on all over.""

1336,Rays of light emerge from tragic life stories in Honduras,"Ledger reporter Gary White recently accompanied local Rotary Club members on a one-week trip to Honduras. This is the second of a three-part series examining a group home founded by a Babson Park couple that is providing hope for young girls rescued from a life of abuse, sex trafficking and abandonment in the Central America country.

CHOLOMA, Honduras — Visiting a home filled with girls saved from sex trafficking, abuse and abandonment, it's natural to expect sadness or misery.

Instead, the 22 girls and one toddler boy in the Compelled By Christ group home generate a buoyant mood. Aside from an occasional pout, the youngsters exude gratitude and seize on any chance to have fun, whether by jumping rope or playing card games or singing together.

The placid mood at the home founded by Bonnie and Keith Barker of Babson Park belies the painful personal histories of its residents. Honduras is one of the poorest and most dangerous countries in the Americas, and some families do what would seem unimaginable in the United States, selling their daughters to sex traffickers, often for scant sums.

The girls confide in Bonnie, commonly addressed as ""Mommy Bonnie,"" who spends one week a month at the home. Sindy, one of two mothers at the facility, told Barker that her mother sold her at age 6 to a gang for a mere dos pollos — two chickens. The girl arrived at the Choloma shelter at age 11, five months pregnant.

Her daughter, Ana, an irrepressible 4-year-old, is the youngest girl living at the home.

Now 16, Sindy is perhaps the most industrious of the residents and seems always to be cleaning or helping to prepare meals. A frequent volunteer in the kitchen, she aspires to be a chef.

The other resident mother, Scarlett, endured being forced into prostitution before adolescence by relatives who were part of the notorious MS-13 gang, Barker said. After being rescued, Scarlett testified against two gang members, who were convicted but quickly bought their way to freedom.

The gang branded Scarlett by filing down her front teeth diagonally, and the girl refused to smile after arriving at the home. She has since received a dental bridge, benefiting from free medical care the local church arranges.

Scarlett, now 16, is the mother of Jordan, 2, the only boy living in the home. Barker says five current or former residents have given birth while at her charity's group homes.

“We tell them, 'If you don't want to care for your baby, we'll help you,' "" Barker says.

Barker says she has met with prominent figures in the country's two main gangs, MS-13 and Calle 18, to inform them about what she is doing. She said the representatives were business-like and didn't object to her activities.

When Barker met Rut (pronounced “Ruth”), she praised her ability to speak some English. The girl, now 14, explained that she had encountered men from the United States during her forced prostitution by a gang in Mexico.

Anna Rodriguez, founder of the Florida Coalition Against Human Trafficking, says gang activity is a major factor in the rise of sex trafficking in Honduras and some other Central American countries. She says the phenomenon of sex tourism also fuels the trafficking of girls (and increasingly, boys) in Latin American countries.

“For example, you go to Nicaragua or Honduras or El Salvador, and basically taxi drivers, one of the questions they ask you is, 'Why are you here and do you want to have company? Do you want to have someone brought to your hotel room?' "" Rodriguez says. “So sex tourism is something very prominent in these Latin American countries, and that's where the sex trafficking component comes in.”

Rodriguez also notes that some Latin American nations have no legal protections for minors, making it easier for them to be exploited.

“In Guatemala, you see 2-year-olds accompanied by a 5-year-old walking between traffic, trying to sell you old candy for a penny,” she says. “Or you see a 5-year-old at a mine with a little hammer, cutting rocks.”

Providing a haven

Barker was directly involved in the rescue of Marilu when the girl was 12. A neighbor named Grisel, having learned the girl's stepfather planned to sell her into prostitution, rode a bus three hours to reach the group home and banged on the gate in the middle of the night.

Barker told the woman she would need to explain to Marilu's mother that if she took her in that the woman might not see her again. She drove into the mountains and arrived to glimpse Marilu's frightened brown eyes staring from behind a window.

Marilu's mother, so poor she used scavenged newspaper as tissues, gave over custody of her daughter, marking a contract with a thumbprint because she couldn't sign her name.

Two years later, Barker got in touch with Grisel and arranged for Marilu's mother to pay a surprise visit on the girl's birthday.

Sisters Gabriella, 15, and Angie, 13, were both forced into prostitution by their parents, according to Barker. When the girls failed to generate the expected income, their father would hang them by their ankles and beat them as if they were piñatas.

One day in a store, a stranger saw Angie, who was so damaged that infectious material was oozing from her pores. The woman helped both girls take refuge in a church and three days later brought them to Barker.

The sisters, now tall and willowy, are reserved around strangers but among the most outwardly passionate during devotional meetings and church services. Gabriella says she wants to become a chef.

Three residents have arrived within the past two weeks. Asly, 11, had been abused by her father, and a pattern of circular scars on her upper chest testify to the lit cigarettes he pressed against her flesh.

The other newcomers are sisters — Yessenia, 11, and Genesis, 7 — who had been sexually abused by their grandfather, Barker says. Like the other younger residents, they greet strangers with immediate affection, bestowing frequent hugs, smiles and in Yessenia's case, drawings of smiling flowers.

Given their backgrounds, the girls' emotional openness toward unfamiliar guests can be surprising. It all reflects on their relationship with “Mommy Bonnie.”

“They think if I trust you, they trust you,” Barker says of visitors.

In the early stages of the children's home, Barker sought out counseling for the residents. But she learned the girls weren't open to discussing their traumatic pasts with strangers.

Barker says the home's natural support system seems to provide the informal therapy the girls need. ""Pastora Patty,"" the unpaid director, and the Honduran house mothers are available for comfort when nightmares arise, and the girls console each other, Barker says

“They all know they have a story, and they're all very compassionate to each other,” Barker says. “What I've always told them is, 'Your story is your story. If you want to share, you can, but I'll never force you to share your story, even with me.' ""

Julissa, the first girl whom the Barkers received, still resides at the home. She had not been trafficked, but Barker says she had been living on the street with her mother, who was disabled.

When Jim Weaver, a past president of the Lake Wales Breakfast Rotary Club and now its international service chair, met Julissa during a 2013 trip she was perpetually hunched over and didn't engage with strangers. Nearly six years later, the tall, svelte girl remains somewhat shy but moves confidently, often wearing a smile.

During the recent visit, Julissa and other girls from the home take part in an elaborate dance for an anniversary celebration at their church. Wearing a white dress with an indigo vest, Julissa exudes joy as she darts and sways, wielding a tambourine festooned with a rainbow of ribbons.

At home on another night, as Rosy strums an acoustic guitar and leads the girls through the song “Cuanto Nos Ama” (“How He Loves”), Julissa grabs her violin to supplement the raucous singing with scraping notes on the instrument she is still learning.

Barker says Julissa, who will graduate from high school this year, ranks at the top of her class and plans to enter a university and become a doctor.

“She was tall and slump-shouldered and has no confidence, and I've just watched her over six years blossom into this beautiful woman who has turned out to be a medallion scholar for two years running in her school, and she wants to be a medical doctor,” Weaver says. “If I gave you those facts, you'd never put that together. You'd never guess that that would happen. That gives you great gratification.”

Sinthia, a fair-skinned 6-year-old, landed in the government orphanage as an infant, while her 14-year-old mother was in another facility. Both girls arrived at the Choloma home before Sinthia's first birthday, but her mother soon fled and did not return.

Having never known a traditional family, Sinthia thrives in the group home. A wispy dervish, she hurls herself into any jump-roping or soccer game that arises. When the girls engage in group singing, Sinthia propels the words from her tiny mouth with ferocity.

Swings of fortune

The saga of Pahola, who seems younger than 12, is one that sparked widespread publicity in Honduras. Barker says a neighbor shot video of the girl chained in her yard and posted it on Facebook, and Pahola's father and stepmother were eventually prosecuted.

Last September, the Barkers were in Honduras, celebrating their wedding anniversary, when they learned about Pahola's plight and immediately agreed to accept her. Pastora Patty, one of the house mothers, warned Barker that Pahola had endured such intense trauma it might take a long time before she could engage or accept affection.

Pahola was placed in a room with Carolyn, a mischievous girl who, among the Choloma group, most resembles a typical American teenager. Barker later learned that Carolyn provided crucial comfort to Pahola, massaging her feet through the night.

When Bonnie Barker arrived to meet Pahola, the girl immediately called out, “Mommy!” and ran to embrace her.

“Pastora started crying because she was so distant with everybody,” Barker says. “It's like all the barriers broke down in that moment and she felt safe. It's like her youth has been restored.”

Pahola told Barker that while chained in the yard, each night she dreamed of being visited by a blue-eyed Jesus. The girl said the visions prepared her not to be afraid when she met Barker, an unfamiliar woman with blue eyes.

During the Rotarians' visit, Pahola is relentlessly cheerful, always smiling and proudly displaying her proficiency at doing handstands and jumping rope. Within days, though, her story takes a different turn, offering a reminder that placement in the group home can be impermanent.

The same day the Rotarians leave, Barker receives a phone call from a government official. She learns that Pahola's biological mother, who had received public sympathy amid the news about the girls' abuse, now wants Pahola back after being given a new house.

The woman, who has six other children, has said she knew nothing of Pahola's previous abuse, a claim Barker questions. Barker says the woman showed up for a photo opportunity after Pahola's rescue but didn't seek custody of her at the time.

The phone call leaves Barker in tears, and six days later, after she has flown back to Florida, she learns that government officials showed up at Pahola's school and delivered her back to her mother, a development Barker calls “devastating.”

The one consolation is that Pahola, whose mistreatment apparently damaged her vision, received glasses the day before she is removed from the Compelled By Christ home.

Honduras' government-run state orphanages have been closed in recent years. Barker is often asked whether the girls in her group home might be adopted. As she explains, Honduras has not allowed adoption by non-citizens in recent years, but government officials are signaling that the policy might change soon, at least for children recognized as “abandoned.”

Supporters also inquire about getting the girls into colleges in the United States. Barker says the Honduran government won't grant the needed visas out of concern that students would not return to the country.

“If you talk to all of our girls, they love their country and they feel like they can be the ones who change their own society for the better,” Barker says. “So their deep desire isn't to live in the United States or even study (there). Their desire is to make a difference here, which I highly respect.”

Hearts get bigger

As is the tradition during visits from outsiders, Barker gathers the girls and their guests on their final night together to reflect on their experiences as a woman from the local church provides translation. The adults and children sit in a wide circle for an 80-minute session rich in emotion.

Almost all of the older girls voluntarily speak, repeatedly saying Gracias and Dios te bendiga (“God bless you”). Several residents thank Dale Scheerer, a winter resident of Lake Wales who has a background as a chef, for exposing them to unfamiliar cuisine and teaching some cooking skills.

Sindy, the aspiring chef, overcomes her bashfulness to stand and address the Rotarians.

“I love you so much,” she says tearfully. “I hope you come back soon.”

Angie, 13, cries as she says she has calculated how much the Rotarians spent to come and spend time with her and the other girls. Rut, one of the least reserved girls, stands for an extended talk.

“I want to thank you for coming from a very far place from here and leaving your families to spend time with some girls who are not your family,” she says. “Every time a group comes here, we take all of you like fathers, grandfathers, brothers. I hope God is always in your hearts, in the same way we are going to be in your hearts, too.”

Lake Wales Rotarian Larry Bossarte's eyes shine as he turns in a circle to address the girls.

“I just wanted to let all of you know how very special you are — all a little different, which is good, but you're all very special and I don't want you to ever forget that,” Bossarte says. “And I will always remember you, and I hope to come back again.”

Weaver, making his 12th visit to Honduras, says he cherishes seeing how much the girls progress over the six-month intervals between visits.

Octogenarian Cliff Jensen of Lake Wales, the designated “Abuelo,” has also seen the residents grow and mature since his first visit in 2013. He tells the girls he receives more from seeing them than he could possibly give.

“It's true that we left our families back in the United States or Canada, but it's also true that we came to see part of our family,” he says. “For those of you that have been here for a longer period of time, you know Jim and I have been here many times and I have told you many times that I look at you as if you were my grandchildren. I tell people in my hometown that I have a lot of granddaughters in Honduras. Hardly a day goes by that I don't think about you, and I talk to people about how great you are.”

When it's Barker's turn to speak, she says the farewell gatherings are always emotional “because our hearts get bigger every time we meet.”

“My dream always is that my home is a place that people want to be, and you girls make this place a place that people want to be,” Barker says. “So thank you. It's always difficult for me. When I'm in the United States, all I think about is being here. And when I'm here, all my children from there are calling me. But my heart is always in both places.”

1337,Dealing with Employee Cynicism: How a Culture of Trust Can Help | Quint Studer,"Cynicism is bad for business. It’s not only ugly, but it’s also a symptom of deeper, more destructive issues. When people are routinely snarky, skeptical, and negative—whether their attitude is aimed at leaders, coworkers, customers, or the company itself—by definition they can’t be engaged and positive. And if they’re not engaged and positive, they can’t be productive, innovative, and helpful to team members and customers.

Cynical behavior harms workplace relationships. It undermines change efforts. It drains enthusiasm. Cynical employees may be irritable or grumpy. No one wants to work with them. They surely won’t put forth extra effort when it’s needed. Plus, cynicism is contagious. A few cynical employees can spread their negative attitude, and before you know it, everyone is infected.

Usually, cynicism is a sign that people are feeling hopeless and powerless. They may feel unsafe, devalued, not listened to. They may see leaders as being ineffective or as not truly having their best interests at heart. And they have no faith that the organization will ever change things for the better. (In all fairness, they may never have seen any evidence of positive change.)

More: Know what causes workplace drama — and take steps to eradicate it | Quint Studer

Your best defense for dealing with cynicism is a good offense. You must attack the problem at the source. You need to proactively and urgently get to work building a culture of trust. This will not happen overnight. But it will improve relationships and promote credibility and resilience.

Get intentional about creating a culture of trust. It won’t happen on its own. Make it a priority. Work to pinpoint what processes or leader behaviors need to change. This will require some digging into the specific issues that may be eroding trust inside your company. Then, create a plan and assign someone to oversee the changes.

Also, it may help to acknowledge publicly that there’s a big problem and that you want to correct it. “We know that in the past things have happened that created the current environment of mistrust. We are committed to fixing this.”

Let people know what right looks like. What are the values and behaviors that define a culture of trust? Do some thinking about this and spell out the behaviors. For example:

- Employees are empowered to make decisions. They don’t have to get permission for everything.

- Employees have a voice and a seat at the table. Leaders seek feedback from them and implement their ideas whenever possible.

- People get to work on challenging projects. Leaders don’t micromanage them.

- Leaders regularly recognize and reward employee contributions.

- Employees are able to choose their work patterns and habits. If they want to work from home or work a flexible schedule, they can (as long as it’s feasible for the job).

- Communication is a top priority. Leaders touch base daily with direct reports to answer questions, offer help, and reduce uncertainty (and the anxiety it causes).

Put it in writing. Creating an official “standards of behavior” document helps crystallize the attitude you’re hoping to cultivate. Spell out actions that create trust and prohibit cynical behavior and put it all in a document. For example: “I will not badmouth customers,” “If I have something to say to an employee, I’ll say it to their face,” “I will step in and help coworkers anytime I can,” “I will not use blind cc’ing in the emails I send.” Have everyone (leaders and employees) sign it and hold them accountable for infractions.

More: Six great ice breakers for high-performance groups | Quint Studer

Let only “Boy Scouts” lead. (And Girl Scouts too, of course!) Hire and promote leaders who truly do live the values your company espouses. They will do too much damage otherwise, which paves the way for mistrust and cynicism. People will emulate leader behavior, so make sure leaders build on and nurture the trust you are trying to create.

Be clear and predictable. Let people know what they can expect. Vagueness and a lack of predictability in behavior, priorities, or values only create anxiety and destroys trust. How can employees trust a leader if they don’t know what that leader wants from them or how that leader might react day to day?

Keep your promises. Do what you say you will do (with both customers and employees). This has to be an across-the-board value. If you aren’t sure you can keep a promise, don’t make it in the first place. And if something outside your control happens and you have to break a promise, let people know as soon as you possibly can. Explain why and apologize.

Be transparent and tell the truth at all times, even when it’s bad news. If there’s even a hint that you could be lying, covering up, or being evasive, employee cynicism will be validated. Trust will be shattered. Once that happens, it is incredibly hard to win people back.

Promote psychological safety. Make it safe to speak up. Are employees allowed to make mistakes without being scolded, shamed, or otherwise punished? If not, they are very unlikely to tell leaders the truth. If they share an idea in a meeting, are they taken seriously? If not, they will keep quiet. Fear and trust cannot coexist. Always choose trust.

It won’t happen overnight, but when people realize that they can trust their leaders, and each other, cynicism will taper off. It simply can’t get a foothold in a culture of trust.

Working in a culture of trust just feels better. People will be more positive and engaged, and the mood of the organization will shift. From that point, amazing things may happen. Everyone will enjoy coming to work. They’ll feel a strong sense of meaning and purpose. They’ll be more likely to form strong relationships with coworkers, which paves the way for better communication and collaboration. All of this will lead to a higher-performing organization. Not a bad payoff for making a change that’s the right thing to do in the first place!

1340,"4 children recovering after SUV plows through fence, falls onto beach","- It was a catastrophic day at the beach, as fun in the sun turned to disaster when kids playing in the sand were run over.

People are scratching their heads, trying to understand what happened, as they hope for a speedy recovery for four children, ages three to 11. Through the hole in the fence, you could see the SUV that struck them, sitting on the beach.

Four children are recovering at the hospital after an SUV lost control on A1A, crashing through a fence and diving 20 feet onto the beach where it landed on a 5-year-old girl. Three other children were also struck as their nearby parents watched in horror. #Fox35 pic.twitter.com/O3QPXbiqOd — Amanda McKenzie (@AmandaMckNews) March 21, 2019







There was shock through this part or Ormond-by-the-Sea, where troopers with the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) say the driver of the vehicle went through a fence onto beach, hitting the children.

“I think it's terrible. What do you do?” said Kai Ponder, who lives nearby.

“Surprise. I've never seen that before,” said Sonny Wirsing, who was sitting in this lot next to the beach reading a magazine when it happened. “Hope for the best. It was a wild sight to see.”

FHP says the driver was parked on the shoulder of State Road A1A, tried to turn and lost control, plowing through a parking lot onto the beach.

FHP says a five-year-old is in the worst shape. She was run over by the truck, and the other three were hit but all are expected to be okay. Crews towed the car before high tide swept it away. Deputies put away some of the victim’s bikes while FHP ticketed William Johnson, 82, of Massachusetts, for careless driving.

1341,'She is a staple of the community',"CARYVILLE - With the great possibility that she may never get another opportunity to use her legs, the family of recent hit-and-run victim Dominique Works is seeking help from the community to help the 33-year-old mother of two adjust from being ""the local walking girl"" to a new life of rehabilitation.

""Dominique cannot fight for herself,"" said Works' sister-in-law Dayna Works. ""This is a very tragic situation, and there is a long road ahead for Dominique and her family,"" she wrote on a Go Fund Me page.

As of Tuesday, the Go Fund Me account established by Dayna Works has raised about $1,500. The family is hoping to raise enough to offset costs of travel for Works' mother to make hospital visits, any medical costs insurance does not cover, any handicap accommodations - such as, wheelchair ramps, etc. - and legal fees associated with the hit-and-run case.

""She is a staple of the community,"" said Dayna Works. ""For 10 plus years, everybody knows her as the girl who walks everywhere. She stays to herself ... People have seen her walking to Bay County, all the way in Marianna, Cottondale - everywhere.""

According to the family, Works has been on disability for mental health reasons. However, comments on Facebook and the Go Fund Me page show a level of concern and love for Works.

""I pray justice is served for you. God is in control,"" wrote Lashonda Stuckey.

""Hoping for a speedy recovery,"" wrote Michael Aronhalt.

On March 11, Works was struck on Highway 90 in Bonifay near Holmestead Road. According to Florida Highway Patrol reports, 41-year-old Amy Worley was driving eastbound on Highway 90 near Holmestead Road when the right front and side of her 2013 Dodge Durango struck Works. Works was walking on the south shoulder at the time.

The investigation is still ongoing.

After striking Works, reports state, Worley fled the scene continuing east bound. Works was thrown 22 feet from the white line. Works was taken to UAB Hospital in Birmingham in critical condition.

Since the accident, Works has undergone a number of surgeries and doctors say she may never be able to walk again.

""She's going to have to have a ramp, possibly a hospital bed, she's going to have to have care,"" Dayna Works said. ""It's a lot for the family. It's a lot.""

Dayna Works noted law enforcement and the community in both Washington and Holmes have been very supportive and the family is very appreciative.

Donations can be made at ""Justice for Dominque Works"" at GoFundMe.com, on Paypal and by contacting Dayna Works directly at 850-768-9739.

1342,"Woman sentenced to life in prison for sitting on, killing girl","PENSACOLA, Fla. - A Florida woman has been sentenced to life in prison for killing her 9-year-old cousin sitting on her as a form of punishment.

The Pensacola News Journal reports that 66-year-old Veronica Green Posey was sentenced Friday after jurors convicted her of first-degree felony murder.

Prosecutors say Dericka Lindsay had suffered horrific beatings from Posey, and Lindsay's adoptive parents, James and Grace Smith. Officials say Posey sat on Dericka for more than five minutes in October 2017, causing the girl to die from lack of oxygen.

Posey's attorney said the 320-pound woman was trying to help the Smiths and didn't intend to hurt Dericka.

James Smith was previously sentenced to 10 years for his role in Dericka's death. Grace Smith still faces charges but is currently mentally and physically unfit to stand trial.

TAMPA (WFLA) - Authorities say a body found in Minnesota matches the description of a 2-year-old girl whose mother was killed in Milwaukee this past week.

Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension spokesman Bruce Gordon said Saturday the body has been preliminarily identified as Noelani Robinson.

Gordon says the body was found in Steele County, Minnesota, south of Minneapolis. He says the Minnesota agency is waiting for formal identification and preliminary autopsy results from the medical examiner.

Authorities had asked “the entire nation” for help finding Noelani after the arrest of the girl’s father, who is suspected of fatally shooting her mother in Milwaukee.

Milwaukee police Chief Alfonso Morales said Friday the suspect, Dariaz Higgins, has been providing police with information on the whereabouts of his daughter, but it all has “proven to be untrue.”",https://www.wfla.com/national/police-need-nationwide-help-in-missing-girl-search/1852256507,2019-03-16T15:19:37Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

MILWAUKEE (AP) - Authorities are asking “the entire nation” for help finding a missing 2-year-old girl after the arrest of a man suspected of fatally shooting her mother in Milwaukee this week, the city’s police chief said Friday.

Chief Alfonso Morales said the suspect, Dariaz Higgins, has been providing police with information on the whereabouts of his daughter, Noelani Robinson, but it all has “proven to be untrue.”

“The search to find Noelani has become a game to him. It’s obviously apparent that he truly doesn’t care about Noelani,” Morales said.

Authorities have not said when or where Noelani was last seen.

Higgins, of Miami, is accused of fatally shooting 24-year-old Sierra Robinson and wounding one of her friends Monday. Police arrested him Wednesday and prosecutors have charged him with first-degree murder.

Prosecutors said in charging documents that Higgins traveled to Milwaukee to give Noelani to Robinson but it’s unknown if Higgins actually brought her with him. Police said Higgins was Robinson’s pimp and they had been romantically involved, but were no longer together. Robinson left Noelani with Higgins when she moved to Las Vegas last month but wanted her back, authorities said.

According to charging documents, Higgins, Robinson, and her friend spent time driving around together in Milwaukee doing drugs Monday, before Higgins took them to an apartment building where he told them Noelani was. Prosecutors said Higgins shot Robinson and her friend when they got out of the car.

Police have said Noelani may be in Minnesota, but Morales emphasized she could be anywhere because Higgins has ties in several states. Morales suggested Noelani could be in the hands of human traffickers, but declined to provide details for why investigators believe that, other than to say “that’s the world that these two individuals lived in, the victim and the suspect.”

The FBI, which is aiding in the search, is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads authorities to Noelani.",http://www.wfla.com/national/police-need-nationwide-help-in-missing-girl-search/1852256507,2019-03-15T21:45:00Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

ST. LUCIE COUNTY — A man was charged with aggravated child abuse after striking a girl and causing what may have been a dislocated jaw, according to paramedics.

The girl, whose age was redacted on the arrest affidavit, was taken to the St. Lucie County Fire District station at 3395 N. State Road A1A with the injury about 6:45 p.m. Wednesday. At the time, the girl was unable to close her mouth. Paramedics took her to a hospital, the affidavit said.

1370,'American Girl Live' celebrates the power of girls at Saenger Theatre,"""American Girl Live"" will perform at the Saenger Theatre during its inaugural tour later this month. (Photo: ©Amy Boyle Photography 2018)

Nanea Mitchell was only 9 years old when Pearl Harbor was attacked in 1941. The calamity afflicted her otherwise peaceful childhood but through the aloha spirit of Hawaii, she and her fellow islanders begin to heal.

Nanea isn't a real person. She's a historically-themed doll that's part of ""American Girl Live,"" a musical performance with six live actors and their American Girl doll counterparts. Its inaugural tour is making a stop at the Pensacola Saenger Theatre on March 20.

""The musical numbers are meant to inspire the audiences with each (song) reflecting the historical era of the American Girl dolls,"" said Kathy Summerlin, director of booking and marketing at the Saenger. ""With March being National Women's History Month, it's perfect timing for moms or grandmothers to take their daughters and granddaughters to celebrate something special.""

The 90-minute show, produced by Mills Entertainment, follows five young campers who face their fears at Camp American Girl in the North Woods. Each of the girls has packed her American Girl doll whose historic personas lend a hand.

""Every character at camp also plays an American Girl doll who comes to life,"" explained Monica Poston, a New York-based actor who portrays the camp's counselor. ""Empowered by the stories and convictions of their American Girl, the campers learn that they can overcome anything and achieve their dreams, so long as they stay true to themselves and support one another.""

Poston's doll role is Julie, a character from the 1970s. The other dolls in the show are Rebecca, a pre-World War I immigrant, Maryellen from the 1950s, Melody of the Civil Rights Era, Luciana the inspiring scientist and the aforementioned Nanea.

A noteworthy feature of ""American Girl Live"" is its all-female creative team, a contrast to the doll's patriarchal eras. The show's director, Gina Rattan, directed the national tour of ""Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella"" among many other credits. Writer Sandy Rustin is currently adapting the film version of ""Clue"" for the stage.

American Girl was founded in 1986 by entrepreneur Pleasant Rowland as a playful means of character building for girls ages 8-12. Each doll comes with a book to complete an interactive role model experience. In terms of a product, the dolls are a starting point for a catalog of accessories like bespoke outfits and character-specific props such as a luau kit for Nanea and an Airstream camper for Maryellen. The dolls can also be taken to American Girl stores for salon-style pampering.

The brand's flagship doll, Kit Kittredge, inspired a well-received movie shown in theaters in 2008. Many of the other dolls have accompanying DVDs as well.

Lynda Stier of Cantonment introduced her daughter, Isabella, to American Girl with a visit to its store in Atlanta. They're going with friends to the Saenger show.

""She (Isabella) enjoys the American Girl dolls and wants to see them life-like,"" Stier said.

As a mother, she appreciated its overall wholesomeness.

""I like the morals and values of the books and they can use their imaginations,"" she continued. ""It gets them away from electronics.""

After Pensacola, ""American Girl Live"" travels to Fort Lauderdale to continue its coast-to-coast run through May.

""Our musical is undeniably of Broadway caliber,"" Poston said. ""We get extremely positive feedback every city we go to.""

BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. - A man accused of inappropriately touching a teenage girl at a South Florida park last summer, giving her a hickey, was arrested on Valentine's Day.

Bailey Chase for years has played the character that viewers often dislike.

The Naples native and father of three said he's enjoying his new roles, including the new Netflix Original movie ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" that premiered earlier this month.

Chase, 46, gained prominence for his acting from 2012 to 2017 on the Western crime series ""Longmire,"" in which he played an ambitious Wyoming sheriff's deputy, Branch Connally.

“More than anything, the arc that I got to do on 'Longmire,' that character Branch, he hit all the notes,"" Chase said in a recent telephone interview.

""It gave me a confidence as an actor that I could do anything, I could play good. I could play bad. And by portraying these newer characters, that’s how I connect with the audience more. Then they start rooting for you.”

In his latest role, based on a true story, Chase plays Cory Snyder, the father of Amberley Snyder, a successful rodeo barrel racer who returns to the sport after a car crash.

In real life, Bailey and his wife, Amy, have three children: twin 2-year-olds (a boy and a girl) and a 4-year-old daughter who was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Chase was still shooting ""Longmire.""

“For me as a dad, to play that role, as an actor, you go to those places where I’m imagining my girl in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair,"" Bailey said.

“Since 'Longmire' and becoming a dad, I feel like I can play anything.”

After graduating from Duke with a bachelor's degree in sports psychology, Chase said, he decided to fulfill ""a boyhood dream"" and headed to Los Angeles instead of New York.

""I came out here, being a Florida boy,"" Chase said. ""The climate was a little bit better. I was living at the beach, waiting tables and going to acting class.”

He eventually traveled overseas to become a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, to study Shakespeare.

Posey was convicted Friday of first-degree murder in the death of her 9-year-old cousin Dericka Lindsay. (Photo: Tony Giberson/tgiberson@pnj.com)

A woman who killed a child by sitting on her as a form of punishment has been sentenced to life in prison.

After a two-day trial in Pensacola, Veronica Green Posey, 66, was found guilty Friday of first-degree felony murder.

Jurors heard evidence the victim, 9-year-old Dericka Lindsay, suffered horrific beatings from her adoptive parents, James and Grace Smith, and her cousin, Posey, when she misbehaved.

The abuse reached a head Oct. 14, 2017, when Posey sat on Dericka in an effort to get the girl under control. The approximately 320-pound woman sat on Dericka for more than five minutes, enough for the child to die from a lack of oxygen.

In an autopsy, the medical examiner found Dericka had severe bruising on her buttocks that she described as ""injury, on top of injury, on top of injury.""

Assistant State Attorney Amy Shea said on the day of Dericka's death, Posey was roused from her sleep by a phone call from Grace Smith saying that Dericka and her 8-year-old sister were acting up.

""Once her feet hit the floor getting out of bed, she was determined to beat these children,"" Shea said.

She took a ruler and a thin pipe intended to give the ruler ""weight,"" then went over to the Smiths' home on Bryant Road and helped Grace Smith whip Dericka. As Dericka struggled, she was forced to kneel down with her chest on the seat of an arm chair while Posey sat on the girl's back.

Dericka reportedly screamed twice that she couldn't breathe, and after Posey got up and realized Dericka wasn't breathing, she called 9-1-1.

Posey's attorney, Michael Griffith, made the case to jurors that Posey had simply been trying to help the Smiths, and that she hadn't intended to hurt Dericka. He noted that Posey didn't live in the same household as Dericka, and if Dericka had been seriously or routinely abused, it was at the hands of the Smiths.

After entering deliberation in the morning, jurors returned their verdict late Friday afternoon.

Judge Jan Shackelford immediately issued Posey the mandatory life sentence.

James Smith has already been sentenced to 10 years in state prison for his role in Dericka's death. Grace Smith currently suffers from mental and physical illnesses that prevent her from standing trial, but she will still face criminal charges should she recover.

WESH 2 News cameras were rolling as Soto took his first steps out of jail.

Court documents show Soto allegedly asked a young girl to come up to his classroom to fix her test while other students were in P.E. class.

Soto is accused of molesting the girl in that Castle Creek Elementary School classroom early last month.

The victim did not tell anybody about it for about a month and Soto was arrested last week.

Soto's attorney said his client is innocent and an upstanding citizen, boasting his long career in the military.

On Thursday, a judge decided to allow Soto to be bonded out of jail for $75,000.

Investigators originally wanted to keep him in jail until trial because they believed there are potentially other victims.

1382,Dericka Lindsay death: Pensacola woman accused of sitting on 9-year-old stands trial,"CLOSE Teachers, classmates, and friends gathered for a memorial service at the grave of 9-year-old Dericka Lindsay to bless and dedicate a permanent marker in Resthaven Gardens Cemetery in Pensacola on Friday, May 18, 2018. Gregg J Pachkowski, Pensacola News Journal

Veronica Posey arrived at a Navy Point home armed with a thin pipe and a ruler, ready to whip an unruly school girl ""into submission,"" prosecutors claim.

Not long afterward, that little girl, 9-year-old Dericka Lindsay, was dead. An autopsy revealed the child had bruising on her buttocks that a career medical examiner called the worst she had ever seen.

There's no question Dericka's too short life was full of horrific abuse. The question before a jury is whether Posey was in the act of abusing Dericka when the child died.

Posey, 66, is charged with first-degree felony murder, and more specifically with committing aggravated child abuse that resulted in Dericka's death.

In the first day of Posey's two-day trial, Assistant State Attorney Amy Shea said Dericka's adoptive parents, James and Grace Smith, are an elderly couple who had trouble reigning in Dericka and her 8-year-old sister. The Smiths sometimes called Posey, Dericka's cousin, to help them discipline the girls.

On Oct. 14, 2017, the Smiths reportedly called Posey and told her Dericka had been threatening them with a knife and a hammer.

Posey reportedly grabbed a ruler and what she described as an ""itty bitty white pipe to give the ruler some weight"" and headed to the Smiths' home on Bryant Road. There, Grace Smith hit Dericka with a belt around 10 times, and Posey hit the girl seven or eight times with the ruler, breaking it in the process, Shea said.

At some point, Dericka was forced to kneel down in front of an armchair, then lean her torso forward across the seat so her head was facedown on the seat cushion. Posey, who weighs approximately 320 pounds, sat on Dericka's back for several minutes, and Dericka died because she was unable to breathe.

Three accused in Dericka's death

► Veronica Posey: Murder indictment handed down for Pensacola woman accused of sitting on child

► James Smith: Dericka Lindsay death: Man sentenced in death of adopted 9-year-old who was sat on

► Grace Smith: Woman charged in death of child will be treated for delirium, 'failure to thrive'

In the days that followed, Medical Examiner Dr. Andrea Minyard said Dericka had bruising on her rear that went more than inch deep, an indication of ""injury, on top of injury, on top of injury,"" she said.

Minyard noted Dericka's bruises were the worst of their kind that she had seen in her 20-plus year career, and that Dericka was wearing four pairs of underwear at the time of her death, possibly in an attempted to give herself some padding during spankings.

Minyard did note that Dericka's could have been bruised anytime during the week prior to her death, and Michael Griffith, Posey's attorney, said that while Dericka's wounds were awful and atrocious, they were not caused by his client.

""The horrible conditions in which this poor child lived were caused by James and Grace Smith,"" Griffith said.

Case unfolds

Initial arrest: Pensacola child dies after 325-pound adult sat on her as punishment

Charges upgraded: State upgrades charges for 2 allegedly involved in child's punishment death

Autopsy:Lindsay had bruising, brain swelling after cousin allegedly sat on her

Additional charges:Three defendants face additional child abuse charge

Audio: 911 call released from Dericka Lindsay death

He told jurors Posey lived in a separate household, played no role in Dericka's day-to-day care and had only gone over to the Smiths' home to help them wrangle in an out of control child.

He said she took the ruler as a last resort in case nothing else worked, and sat on Dericka ""to try and keep her from getting up and running around and causing anymore problems.""

Shea, however, claimed that from the moment Posey got the call about Dericka's misbehavior, she was angry, fed up and intent on going to the Smith's house to ""whip that child and beat her into submission, and that's what she did.""

Posey's trial is scheduled to wrap up Friday. If convicted of first-degree murder, she faces an automatic life sentence.

James Smith has already pleaded no contest to his role in Dericka's death, and he has been sentenced to 10 years in state prison. Grace Smith suffers from physical and mental ailments that currently make her unable to stand trial, but the charges against her will stand if and when she recovers.

News 6 reporters saw parents rushing to pick up their kids from Lake Mary High School throughout the day Wednesday after school leaders notified parents about the incident.

""I was working when he texted me, and then I just started asking him what’s going on,"" parent Hilsia Fernandez said.

The school was placed on lockdown after hearing the gunfire in case of the possibilty of there being an active threat on campus.

""When it happened, I actually ran into another classroom,"" student Angel Diaz said. ""They say that we’re still going to be on code red, and they explained about the girl that shot herself.""

Many students were in shock after officials told them what happened.

Some parents said the tragedy is unfortunate and serves as a reminder to talk to their kids.

""I was just telling my son, whatever problem you have, come to me, talk to me and we can figure out if we can resolve the problem,"" Fernandez said.

The student's name has not been released and authorities are still working to figure out how she was able to get a gun, according to the Seminole County Sheriff's Office.

1387,Former Estero youth pastor's bond revoked after police report no-contact order violation,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

Former youth pastor Jerred Peacock's bond was revoked Monday after he was found in the parking lot of a Fort Myers hotel with a girl he is accused of having sex with and had been ordered to not contact, an arrest report states.

A warrant affidavit from the State Attorney’s Office alleges Peacock, 34, was in a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl between March 2018 and August 2018 while he was still a youth pastor at Living Waters Church in Estero.

Lee County deputies arrested Peacock on Oct. 12 and he was released the next day on a $100,000 bond. On Oct. 13, Lee Circuit Judge John Duryea issued a no-contact order, court records show.

On Jan. 28, Lee Circuit Judge Bruce Kyle denied a motion to set aside the no-contact order.

On Feb. 11, Fort Myers police responded to a call at the Hyatt Place Hotel in Fort Myers and found Peacock and the girl together inside his car at the hotel's parking lot, court documents state.

A hearing to revoke Peacock's bond was held Monday at 1:30 p.m. and Peacock was arrested later that afternoon. Peacock remains in custody at the Lee County Justice Center.

Special Victims Unit detectives interviewed the girl in August, and she at first denied any sexual relationship. In a second interview later that month, she told detectives that Peacock on several occasions had touched her genitals and made her touch his, including at his home when his wife was at work.

""She did not tell the truth during the first interview because she was embarrassed, scared and did not want to get Jerred in trouble,"" the report states.

The affidavit states Ed Ivie, the pastor who oversees operations at the church, fired Peacock around September.

Aidan Zellmer was sentenced Monday in the June 2017 beating death of Kiaya Campbell of Thornton.

Zellmer was 15 at the time and was charged as an adult. He pleaded guilty to first-degree murder after deliberation on Feb. 1, and prosecutors agreed to drop a charge of first-degree murder of a child.

Police said Campbell and Zellmer were walking together to go shopping when she disappeared. Her body was found the next day.

Police said Zellmer told investigators that he got separated from Campbell during a rainstorm.

District Attorney Dave Young called it the most violent act he has seen a 15-year-old commit.

“Fifteen-year-olds make bad decisions but they don’t commit cruel, heinous crimes like this,” Young said, according to The Denver Channel. “After striking her five times win the head with a metal pipe, he left her in a field.

A Colorado teen who pleaded guilty to killing a 10-year-old girl has been sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 40 years.Aidan Zellmer was sentenced Monday in the June 2017 beating death of Kiaya Campbell of Thornton, who was the daughter of his mother’s boyfriend. Zellmer was 15 at the time and was charged as an adult. He pleaded guilty to first-degree murder after deliberation on Feb. 1, and prosecutors agreed to drop a charge of first-degree murder of a child. The Dever Post reports Campbell was first reported missing on June 7, 2017. Zellmer initially told police the two were going to steal Pokemon cards after he damaged some of hers. After they failed to steal the cards, he said, he lost Campbell as the two walked home through a storm. “Aidan was told his story did not make sense and he kept telling us that is what happened,” an arrest document stated. Campbell's body was found the next day. When he was told about her body being discovered, Zellmer cried and said he didn't hurt Campbell but left her behind on the walk home because she was being annoying. However, evidence collection and an autopsy linked the murder to Zellmer. The teen told officers he used a metal object to beat Campbell. KDVR reports an affidavit identified the murder weapon as a pipe. He has never provided a motive for his actions. District Attorney Dave Young called it the most violent act he has seen a 15-year-old commit. He dismissed Zellmer's defense, which centered around the boy's mental health issues, troubled family history and alleged abuse.“Fifteen-year-olds make bad decisions but they don’t commit cruel, heinous crimes like this,” Young said, according to the Denver Channel. “After striking her five times in the head with a metal pipe, he left her in a field.

1393,"More potential victims accuse Orlando teacher of molestation, deputies say","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - Orange County deputies say more potential victims have come forward accusing an Orlando teacher of molestation.

Julio Soto, 49, was Friday after an 11-year-old girl he taught at Castle Creek Elementary School said that Soto touched her chest twice while they were alone in a classroom one day in February.

“We are speaking to potential victims who made allegations of inappropriate touching,” Deputy Christian Marrero said.

He said during a news conference Tuesday that the investigation is still in the early stages so authorities can't comment on the exact allegations that other potential victims have reported.

Deputies said the original allegation stems from an incident in February where Soto pulled the girl from a physical education class and told her to come to his classroom to fix a test she had recently taken.

Soto stood behind the girl told her he was going to find her ""tickle spot"" and touched her first over her clothes then underneath until she told him to stop, according to the report. Deputies said he touched the girl again on her chest before telling her to return to class.

The girl was initially too embarrassed to report what happened but recently told a friend, who alerted administration.

Captain Orlando Torres said this incident illustrates the importance of parents talking to their children and teaching them the difference between ""a good touch and a bad touch.""

""We tell parents to have open lines of communication without leading their child into potentially making a statement that isn't true,"" Torres said.

Deputies said they want the community to know that they will investigate any and all leads or allegations that surface at the highest priority.

“What we really want in this case is for the community to know that we take these things very seriously and we also work hand in hand with (Orange County Public Schools) and they also take these things very seriously,"" Torres said. ""We’re going to continue to investigate this case until we’ve reached every possible lead or any possible piece of evidence in this case.""

It's unclear at this point if additional charges will be filed against Soto.

He's being held without bond at the Orange County Jail on a charge of lewd and lascivious molestation of a child under 12 years old.

Since his arrest, Soto has been placed on administrative leave and will not be back in a classroom while there is an open internal investigation.

He has been teaching at Castle Creek Elementary since August 2015.

Drew Brockington only recently blasted off into the wide world of reading festivals. But he’s quickly learned that everyone wants to talk to him about the same thing.

Cats, of course.

And more specifically: Cats in space.

That’s what happens when you create a graphic-novel series about an elite team of cat astronauts called the “CatStronauts.” All the kids want to tell you about their own little Neil Armstrongs.

“Right away, they start telling me about their cats,” Brockington says and laughs. “They’re like, ‘Oh, our cat could go into space like that.’ And I’m like, ‘OK…’”

Brockington, of course, is more than happy to talk about cats at Saturday’s Southwest Florida Reading Festival. He’ll be one of 19 authors attending the 20th annual event, including novelists Peter Swanson, Karen White and Lauren Willig; children’s author Jackson Pearce; and audiobook narrator Johnny Heller.

Seattle novelist Tara Conklin will be there, too, hot off the success of her brand-new New York Times bestseller “The Last Romantics” It’s Conklin’s follow-up to her previous bestseller, “The House Girl,” so she’s starting to get used to attending reading festivals.

“They’re great fun!” she says. “You get to meet other writers as well as readers.”

Writing is mostly a solitary activity, Conklin explains. So it’s good to get out of the house and interact with real people for a change.

“That once a month shower happens,” she says and laughs. “And I put on clothes other than pajamas.”

An estimated 10,000 readers attend the Southwest Florida Reading Festival every year, says fest coordinator Melissa Baker. And organizers want to give them something special for the downtown Fort Myers event’s 20th anniversary.

Saturday’s fest will feature 19 authors — four more than last year’s 15. And this time, First Street will be blocked off in front of Fort Myers Regional Library to make room for food trucks and food vendors. That way, Baker says, people can grab some barbecue, Jamaican food, ice cream, cupcakes and other food — and then they can get back to the authors.

“We certainly want to make it special and significant,” Baker says about the 20th anniversary fest. “And we’ll have more of a festive atmosphere with the food trucks.”

The free festival takes place 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and features book signings, meet-and-greets, author talks, readings, kids activities and more. This is the second year the event has taken place at the library instead of its usual Centennial Park and Harborside Event Center, due to construction and renovation at Harborside.

The Lee County Library System organizes the popular event every year to celebrate reading and shine a spotlight on the library’s many services. “It’s to share the joy of reading and just celebrate literacy,” Baker says.

Conklin and Brockington are happy to celebrate along with their fans. And they’re willing to answer questions people have about everything from their writing processes to the inspirations behind their popular books.

The idea for Conklin’s “The Last Romantics,” for example, originated with a tragedy in the Conklin family. She won’t go into specifics about what happened, though — and for a good reason. “It’s a total spoiler!” she says.

That family tragedy happened about 15 years ago.

“This event prompted a lot of questions in my head about love and family and obligation and success and betrayal and grief,” she says. “And all of these questions planted themselves in the back of my brain and they percolated there for about a decade. And then I sat down to explore them with a fictional family that I called The Skinners.”

Another inspiration: Growing up with two sisters and then, later, becoming the mother of three kids. “Watching their sibling dynamic is eternally fascinating to me,” Conklin says.

Minneapolis author Brockington got the idea for his CatStronauts after drawing a cat astronaut in his sketch book. His graphic novels follow the adventures of space cats Major Meowser, Waffles, Blanket and Pom Pom.

“For me, it was just a fun, cute drawing in my sketchbook and a way I can use all these bad cat puns,” Brockington says. “That’s why I like it!

“It’s a fun name to say and a fun idea. Cats are so graceful on the planet. So what would they look like in zero gravity?”

It wasn’t until later, when he Googled the term “catstronaut,” that he discovered cat astronauts were already a popular meme. “There’s this whole subculture!” Brockington says.

His “CatStronaut” series taps into that subculture and offers even more, he says. “I always tell people, if you like space, adventure, bad jokes or cats, you might enjoy these books.""

If you don't like cats, that's OK, too. There are 18 other authors to choose from Saturday.

1398,JASON BLAKENEY: A young girl wants to learn about Florida,"Earlier this week, a letter to the editor came in that made me smile. A young lady from California was looking for help. Usually, I keep letters local. I don’t even like to include letters from the Pensacola area because so little of our readership resides in Escambia County.

But this letter was different, and I think our readers are perfect to help her. Our area is full of smart, caring, engaged people, and that’s exactly what Emily needs.

Here is her letter:

Dear editors of the daily News,

Would you please print my letter in you ""Letters to the Editor""? This would be a great help to me in completing my state project. Thank you!

Dear People of the Great State of Florida,

Greetings! My name is Emily V., and I am a fifth-grade student at Salida Elementary School in Salida, California. We live in the central valley located east of San Frrancisco. This year we are to each complete a state project. I picked Florida! I am asking for any and all information from and about your Great State of Florida to be sent to me. If you would please send me any postcards, articles, maps, pictures, pins, pencils, posters, pamphlets, or any other special items from Florida for my project,

My school address is:

Emily V.

c/o Mr. Howell, 5th grade

Salida Elementary School

4519 Finney Rd.

Salida, CA 95368

I really appreciate your help in making mine the best! I am lucky to have and learn about an awesome state like Florida!

Sincerely,

Emily V.

Emily used a heart instead of a period at the end of her letter, but I couldn’t re-create that here.

Now that you’ve read her letter, let’s educate this young lady on all of the great tings about our state. There’s no doubt our state gets its share of negative attention (Florida Man is a thing, ya know?), but sharing positive, historical information with this young lady, or even just a simple letter letting her know you support her learning more about her state can make a real difference in this young life.

So, send her a little something — a map, a book, a note, whatever, just something. Let’s show her she picked the right community to ask for help.

1401,Death toll rises to 50 in New Zealand mosque massacre,"Advertisement Death toll rises to 50 in New Zealand mosque massacre Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Anguished relatives were anxiously waiting Sunday for authorities to release the remains of those who were killed in massacres at two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch, while police announced the death toll from the racist attacks had risen to 50.Islamic law calls for bodies to be cleansed and buried as soon as possible after death, usually within 24 hours. But two days after the worst terrorist attack in the country’s modern history, relatives remained unsure when they would be able to bury their loved ones.Police Commissioner Mike Bush said police were working with pathologists and coroners to release the bodies as soon as they could.“We have to be absolutely clear on the cause of death and confirm their identity before that can happen,” he said. “But we are so aware of the cultural and religious needs. So we are doing that as quickly and as sensitively as possible.”Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said a small number of bodies would start being released to families Sunday evening, and authorities hoped to release all the bodies by Wednesday.Police said they had released a preliminary list of the victims to families, which has helped give closure to some relatives who were waiting for any news.The scale of the tragedy and the task still ahead became clear as supporters arrived from across the country to help with the burial rituals in Christchurch and authorities sent in backhoes to dig new graves in a Muslim burial area that was newly fenced off and blocked from view with white netting.The suspect in the shootings, 28-year-old white supremacist Brenton Harrison Tarrant, appeared in court Saturday amid strict security, shackled and wearing all-white prison garb, and showed no emotion when the judge read him one murder charge and said more would likely follow.Tarrant, the suspect, had posted a jumbled 74-page anti-immigrant manifesto online before the attacks and apparently used a helmet-mounted camera to broadcast live video of the slaughter.Ardern said the gunman had sent the manifesto to her office email about nine minutes before the attacks, although she hadn’t gotten the email directly herself. She said her office was one of about 30 recipients and had forwarded the email to Parliamentary security within a couple of minutes of receiving it.Bush said at a news conference Sunday that they found another body at Al Noor mosque as they finished removing the victims, bringing the number of people killed there to 42. Another seven people were killed at Linwood mosque and one more person died later at Christchurch Hospital.Another 34 victims remained at Christchurch Hospital, where officials said 12 were in critical condition. And a 4-year-old girl at a children’s hospital in Auckland was also listed as critical.Dozens of Muslim supporters gathered at a center set up for victims, families and friends across the road from the hospital, where many had flown in from around New Zealand to offer support. About two dozen men received instructions on their duties Sunday morning, which included Muslim burial customs.Abdul Hakim, 56, of Auckland, was among many who had flown in to help.“As soon as people die we must bury them as soon as possible,” Hakim said. “We are all here to help them in washing the body, putting them in the grave.”Javed Dadabhai, who flew from Auckland after learning about the death of his 35-year-old cousin Junaid Mortara, said the Muslim community was being patient.“The family understands that it’s a crime scene. It’s going to be a criminal charge against the guy who’s done this, so they need to be pretty thorough,” he said.Still, it was hard, he said, because the grieving process wouldn’t really begin until he could bury his cousin.People across New Zealand were still trying to come to terms with the massacre that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described as “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”A steady stream of mourners arrived at a makeshift memorial outside the Al Noor mosque, where hundreds of flowers lay piled amid candles, balloons and notes of grief and love. As a light rain fell, people clutched each other and wept quietly.Under a nearby tree, someone had left a potted plant adorned with cut out red paper hearts. “We wish we knew your name to write upon your heart. We wish we knew your favorite song, what makes you smile, what makes you cry. We made a heart for you. 50 hearts for 50 lives.”The gunman livestreamed 17 minutes of the rampage at the Al Noor mosque, where he sprayed worshippers with bullets. Facebook, Twitter and Google scrambled to take down the video, which was widely available on social media for hours after the bloodbath.The second attack took place at the Linwood mosque about 5 kilometers (3 miles) away.Ardern has said Tarrant was a licensed gun owner who bought the five guns used in the crimes legally.Ardern reiterated her promise that there will be changes to the country’s gun laws in a news conference Sunday, saying her Cabinet will discuss the policy details on Monday.Ardern used some of her strongest language yet about gun control, saying that laws need to change and “they will change.”Neighboring Australia has virtually banned semi-automatic rifles from private ownership since a lone gunman killed 35 people with assault rifles in 1996.Before Friday’s attack, New Zealand’s deadliest shooting in modern history took place in 1990 in the small town of Aramoana, where a gunman killed 13 people following a dispute with a neighbor.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/new-zealand-mosques-shootings-terrorist-attack/26830392,2019-03-17T08:47:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
1402,"Netflix, ‘Longmire’ actor Bailey Chase talks about growing up in Naples, career, family","Naples native Bailey Chase co-stars with Spencer Locke in a new Netflix Original movie, ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" (Photo: Photo courtesy of Greg Peters)

Bailey Chase for years has played the character that viewers often dislike.

The Naples native and father of three said he's enjoying his new roles, including the new Netflix Original movie ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" that premiered earlier this month.

Chase, 46, gained prominence for his acting from 2012 to 2017 on the Western crime series ""Longmire,"" in which he played an ambitious Wyoming sheriff's deputy, Branch Connally.

“More than anything, the arc that I got to do on 'Longmire,' that character Branch, he hit all the notes,"" Chase said in a recent telephone interview.

""It gave me a confidence as an actor that I could do anything, I could play good. I could play bad. And by portraying these newer characters, that’s how I connect with the audience more. Then they start rooting for you.”

In his latest role, based on a true story, Chase plays Cory Snyder, the father of Amberley Snyder, a successful rodeo barrel racer who returns to the sport after a car crash.

In real life, Bailey and his wife, Amy, have three children: twin 2-year-olds (a boy and a girl) and a 4-year-old daughter who was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Chase was still shooting ""Longmire.""

“For me as a dad, to play that role, as an actor, you go to those places where I’m imagining my girl in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair,"" Bailey said.

“Since 'Longmire' and becoming a dad, I feel like I can play anything.”

Happy Mother’s Day to all the amazing Mama’s out there (miss you Mom) and to my beautiful wife for these 3 little backseat drivers ❤️🚌 pic.twitter.com/dln0pQr4cT — Bailey Chase (@Bailey_Chase) May 13, 2018

Born in Chicago, he grew up in Naples from age 4 through his freshman year at Naples High School. He transferred to the Bolles School in Jacksonville, where he played football and baseball and graduated from the private school before heading to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

After graduating from Duke with a bachelor's degree in sports psychology, Chase said, he decided to fulfill ""a boyhood dream"" and headed to Los Angeles instead of New York.

""I came out here, being a Florida boy,"" Chase said. ""The climate was a little bit better. I was living at the beach, waiting tables and going to acting class.”

He eventually traveled overseas to become a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, to study Shakespeare.

When he returned to the U.S., he landed a role on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" a television series that ran from 1997 to 2003. For the next few years, Chase portrayed Chris Robert Hughes on the soap opera ""As The World Turns.""

He co-starred as ""Becks"" Scott in the ABC comedy-drama ""Ugly Betty,"" which ran from 2006 to 2010, and on the TNT series ""Saving Grace,"" which ran between 2007 and 2010.

But his most notable role came in 2012, on ""Longmire,"" which began on A&E channel and later was presented on Netflix. Robert Taylor starred as Walt Longmire, a stoic, rugged, no-nonsense sheriff; the actor revealed his Australian accent away from the camera, Chase said.

""He’s a good dude,"" Chase said of Taylor. ""It was a strong cast. We were all distinctly different.”

Longmire"" also co-starred Katee Sackhoff, Lou Diamond Phillips and Gerald McRaney, known for his TV roles on ""Major Dad"" and ""Simon & Simon"" that Chase said he grew up watching.

Upcoming work for Chase will include a role in the summer on season four of ""Queen of the South,"" a crime drama on the USA Network. Chase said he has been flying to New Orleans for filming and returning home to L.A. every weekend.

All he said he could reveal about his character is that he's ""a jazz musician with a dark past.""

Chase said he still has family in Florida, including a brother who is a builder based in Ocala. He hasn't been in Naples for more than a decade but hopes to visit again one day.

“Growing up down there, I couldn’t wait to get out,"" he said of Naples. ""But once I got into my 20s and my 30s, I always enjoyed coming back home. Naples will always be home. It's so humid; it just has a feel and a smell. It’s very nostalgic for me.”

1403,Judge allows courtroom cameras for trial of R. Kelly,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Ashlee Rezin/Chicago Sun-Times via AP, File)

CHICAGO (AP) — Cameras will be allowed in the courtroom during the trial and pretrial hearings in R. Kelly’s sexual abuse case, but the R&B singer’s accusers can’t be photographed or filmed without their consent, a judge ruled Friday.

The Grammy-winning singer didn’t attend the brief hearing in Cook County Circuit Court, but his lawyer did.

Associate Judge Lawrence Flood said cameras will be allowed going forward, beginning with the next hearing on March 22. He also said two accusers have already said they don’t want to be photographed or filmed in court.

Kelly, 52, has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse pertaining to four women, including three who were minors at the time the abuse allegedly occurred. The abuse in question is alleged to have occurred over roughly a decade, starting in the late 1990s.

Kelly has been trailed for decades by allegations that he victimized women and girls, though he was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 related to a tape that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He and his attorneys have repeatedly denied allegations of sexual misconduct, and he has pleaded not guilty to the charges. In a recent TV interview, Kelly pleaded with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

Cook County, which includes Chicago, has started allowing cameras in its courtrooms in recent years.

Another judge in the same courthouse has yet to decide if he’ll allow cameras in the courtroom for the trial of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who is accused of lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

Cameras were allowed in court during the trial of Jason Van Dyke, a white former Chicago police officer who was convicted of murder in the shooting death of a black teenager, Laquan McDonald.",https://www.wfla.com/national/judge-allows-courtroom-cameras-for-trial-of-r-kelly/1851691451,2019-03-15T19:20:48Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1404,"Lawsuit alleges first-grade student forced to have sex with a peer, school board negligent","against the Okaloosa County School Board alleges the board was negligent in supervising students in a first-grade classroom.

The suit, filed March 14, claims a seven-year-old Shalimar Elementary student was coerced into a bathroom by two other students (a boy and a girl) where he was forced to engage in sexual acts, including sexual intercourse - the whole time, left unsupervised.

""With regard to how long they were in the bathroom, I submit to you this: They were in there long enough to go in there and take their pants off, touch each other and perform sexual acts,"" said attorney Aaron Watson. ""So, from our opinion, it was too long.""

attorneys representing the boy told Channel 3's Hannah Mackenzie the alleged incident took place in 2016 but was not reported until later.

""How do you expect a six and seven-year-old child to digest that?"" asked Marlon White. ""How do you expect a six and seven-year-old child to reconcile what's just happened to them and adequately explain it to their parents?""



Before this lawsuit was made public, we caught up with Okaloosa County School Superintendent, and asked about the district's policy on investigating claims like this one. He says the key is transparency.

""The very first thing that we're doing is we're calling the [Department of children and families] hotline - that's first and foremost,"" said Chambers. ""Secondly, we're going to be communicating with our sheriff's office through our [school resource officer]. Our principals know from there, to contact the human resources department, then finally, we make sure that the parents are contacted.""

Chambers has only served as superintendent for six weeks. He replaces , who was suspended earlier this year by Governor Ron DeSantis after it was alleged she mishandled child abuse allegations.

According to white, his client is no longer enrolled in the school district. He is being homeschooled.

""We don't expect the schools and teachers to prevent everything from happening,"" said White. ""However, they have a duty and it's reasonable to expect and they should be supervised enough to where things like this should not happen to elementary school-aged kids.""

Monetary damages aren't specified in the lawsuit, but compensation for attorney fees and psychiatric diagnoses and treatment is mentioned.

The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office was brought in to investigate. They closed their case without making any arrest.

1406,East SR 40: Driver of 3-wheel motorcyle killed in crash,"The crash occurred in the Ocala National Forest at Northeast 231st Avenue, also known as Forest Road 88.

A woman was killed Thursday afternoon when a car rear-ended the three-wheel motorcycle she was driving on East State Road 40 in the Ocala National Forest.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers did not immediately release the woman's name, pending notification of family members.

The crash occurred at Northeast 231st Avenue, also known as Forest Road 88.

Troopers at the scene said a Ford Focus was traveling east on SR 40 behind the motorcycle. The motorcyclist slowed down, apparently to make a turn onto FR 88, and the Focus hit her from behind.

The impact pushed the motorcycle forward into the westbound lane, where it sideswiped a Buick Enclave. The woman was thrown from motorcycle onto the grassy shoulder of the highway.

Marion County Fire Rescue spokesman James Lucas said a call came in at 2:28 p.m. and firefighters arrived on the scene 10 minutes later. The driver of the motorcycle/trike was pronounced dead at 2:40 p.m.

Troopers said none of the other people involved in the crash had to be transported to the hospital.

The driver of the Ford was Joseph Bailey, 32, of Missouri, according to FHP. His passengers were his wife, Melissa Lane, 29, and two children, an 11-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl.

The driver of the Buick was Jeryl Ellett, 65, of Ormond Beach, troopers said.

A mother of two was arrested and accused of beating her eldest daughter to death with a belt after initially telling investigators the child fell from a balcony at a southwest Houston apartment complex, according to authorities.The whipping is believed to have caused the death of 5-year-old Samantha Bell on Saturday, a prosecutor said Monday at a probable cause hearing. The girl's mother, Andrea Webb, 21, has so far been charged with a single count of injury to a child but that will likely be upgraded to murder pending the results of an autopsy, court documents show.The mother at first said her daughter fell from a second-story balcony at their building in the 8500 block of Broadway Street because ""she was scared about being charged with murder,"" the prosecutor said. She soon recanted as investigators disputed her claim. The bruises that covered little Samantha were not consistent with a fall, according to police.The mother allegedly admitted to striking the girl with a belt as punishment and forced her to sit against a wall without ""the support of a seat"" for hours, the prosecutor said.She cut the belt in half ""so she wouldn't hit herself with it,"" the official said, adding that when Webb decided her belt was not thick enough — she had her boyfriend borrow another one from a neighbor.Defense attorney Tanya Kelley handed Webb a bundle of tissues as her bond was set at $50,000. She described Webb as an unemployed waitress who had relied on public transportation to get to and from work. This was her first known arrest in Harris County.The mother buried her face in her hands and sniffled as her hearing ended.The mother's unidentified boyfriend was arrested for a parole violation after the child's death.Child Protective Services spokeswoman Tiffani Butler said the agency had no prior case on the family.

The former Naples High School teacher accused of sex crimes against two students pleaded no contest Tuesday in one of two cases he is facing.

Brock Smith, 31, pleaded no contest to felony charges of transmitting harmful material to a minor and using a computer service to seduce, solicit, lure or entice a child for pornography.

Around July 16, 2017, Smith requested to follow a girl on Instagram. Through Instagram direct messages, he told her to delete the message thread and add him on Snapchat, according to an arrest report.

The girl then added Smith to her Snapchat account, and Smith sent her lewd messages, the report states. Smith sent the girl a photo, via Snapchat, of himself nude, standing in front of a bathroom mirror brushing his teeth, according to the report.

Smith then requested that the girl send him a photo, the report states. He continued to message the girl through Snapchat for about a week and told her ""that he was free in the mornings to meet for sex"" when his wife would be out of town, according to the report.

Collier Circuit Judge Ramiro Mañalich did not sentence Smith on Tuesday; sentencing is set for May 9, court documents show.

In another case which is to be set for trial, the former teacher faces two felony charges of engaging in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17 years old, court documents show. The girl in the case is expected to be at an April 29 hearing.

Smith told investigators that he had sexual intercourse with the girl in a bathroom where she was employed, the arrest report states.

Smith was arrested on Aug. 14, 2017, after an investigation from the Collier County Sheriff's Office and the state Department of Children and Families.

Smith was hired by Collier County Public Schools in 2011 and worked at Naples High School for six years prior to his arrest. He also was a coach for the school's football team.

After School Board members approved his dismissal at a Sept. 26, 2017, meeting, Smith was fired, then-Collier school district spokesman Greg Turchetta said at the time.

1412,Warning for parents after students' nude photos leaked online,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A social media expert is offering a warning for parents in the wake of two News4Jax stories regarding strangers posting nude photos of young people to Snapchat.

A St. Johns County man is accused of blackmailing a young girl with a nude photo after deputies said he threatened to post it online unless she sent him a nude video via Snapchat. Kameron McGauley, 18, was charged with extortion.

News4Jax visited his listed address. No one answered the door.

Meanwhile, the Nassau County Sheriff's Office is investigating after a separate Snapchat account appears to be spreading nude photos of middle and high school age students.

RELATED: Deputies: Man threatened to post nude photo of young girl | Snapchat account leaking nude photos of young students

Social media consultant Dwann Rollinson wants parents to know Snapchat erases photos, should the user choose, after they've been sent, which makes the app a venue for sending inappropriate photos.

""When it comes to Snapchat, if it doesn't feel right, it's normally not right,"" Rollinson said. ""One of the misconceptions is that because it disappears, you won't get in trouble. Because it disappears, the cops won't find out, educators won't find out.""

Robinson pointed out that others can also take a screenshot of the photo to keep for themselves. In addition to monitoring their children's social media accounts, she's reminding parents that nothing truly disappears.

""Parents have to remember to tell their children that their digital thumbprint lasts a lifetime,"" Rollinson said. ""And when it's time to find out information, legal authorities can begin to really use Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram -- all those things against them.""

Weighing 98.4 pounds, Bella is strong, protective and has been returned to the shelter a few times for not caring for other dogs and cats and for protecting her owners.

She loves to snooze the day away on a comfy couch, is house trained and only chews what she’s supposed to.

Bella is a shelter favorite at Pet Rescue by Judy.

“We don't understand how such a sweet girl can stay here so long,” the rescue said. “She does not get along with other dogs, but wants to be with people. Once she gets to know you, she'll really bond to you. She is a very loyal dog who will protect her family.”

This sweet girl walks well on a leash, stays right by your side, but does not react well when a car or bicycle goes by.

Thunderstorms are not her favorite thing, but people are once she gets to know them.

Michele Hall looks down at the pregnancy test cradled in her hand.

A plus sign appears. She gasps.How can this be?

From the bathroom, she yells for her husband, Jerry, who's in the kitchen making breakfast. They meet at the doorway and she slowly hands him their future.

A plus sign. Positive.

She watches him as he stares down at the tiny symbol that holds so much value. The blood drains from his face.

They look at one another. How can they raise another child? How is it even possible?

She's 50. He's 47.

She's already a mom of four. All her children are grown and out of the house, except for her 14-year-old daughter, Aubrey Hall, the only child she shares with Jerry.

More: As births decline in young women, they keep rising in 40-somethings. Here's why.

In 2017, her doctor told her she was in menopause. Based on a blood test result, her chances of becoming pregnant were slim to none.

Oct. 8, 2018, was the day Michele Hall found out she was pregnant. She was already at about 26 weeks. It's a boy.

How did she miss the signs? She didn't experience any morning sickness or weight gain. She felt bodily aches and pains but brushed them off as signs of menopause or lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease she'd been battling for more than 10 years. That was until she realized it could be something else, so she bought the pregnancy test.

In the span of two months — from October to December — the Halls experienced every emotion in the book when they learned they were having a baby boy.

Shock

Shock was the first reaction.

""Everyone was in shock,"" Michele Hall said about her family's reaction to the surprising news. At this time, she was only weeks away from giving birth.

“Definitely in shock,” her husband agreed.

""So in shock,"" daughter Aubrey said.

“It does make me feel young, though,"" her father quipped.

“Not me,"" said Michele Hall, laughing. ""I don’t feel so young right now.""

The Halls, who live in Golden Gate Estates, had less than two months to prepare for their baby.

While it was a blessing, Michele and Jerry Hall didn't have any plans to expand their family. Once their daughter left the nest, they planned to travel more, maybe go on a cruise.

“But we have to put the brakes on that and start over again,” Michele Hall said.

They never questioned whether or not they would keep the baby. It was a no-brainer. Yes, of course, they would.

In a way, motherhood has defined Michele Hall.

She had her first child, Aaron Myers, now 34, at age 15. Then she gave birth to a girl, Heather Yeager, now 28, and another son, Brandon Myers, 24. Her youngest is Aubrey. Her eldest daughter has two children — 6-year-old Maeleigh and Emmalyn, 4, who live in Iowa. Her two sons live in Pennsylvania, where the Halls are originally from.

“Everyone was in shock” Michele Hall,, 50-year-old mom and grandma

Michele Hall, along with husband Jerry and daughter Aubrey, moved to Golden Gate Estates several years ago after falling in love with the area.

Michele started home schooling Aubrey. Jerry worked as a cabinetmaker. They lived in a cozy house with plenty of land. Life was good.

Her doctor in Pennsylvania told her she was in menopause. The diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor in Naples. Any chance of her becoming pregnant, they said, was close to zero.

Before a woman reaches menopause, she undergoes a yearslong transition called perimenopause, or the transition to menopause. This process usually starts in the mid-to-late 40s. During this process, a woman may deal with irregular periods and hot flashes, according to the Office on Women's Health, a division of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

More: U.S. birth rate plummets to lowest point in 30 years

The average age for menopause in the United States is 52. Menopause is reached once it has been a full year since the last period. At that stage, a woman can no longer get pregnant.

Michele Hall said she didn't have a period for more than a year. For a chunk of that time, as she didn't realize until later on, it was because she was already pregnant.

When she found out she was expecting, she said she felt like one of those women on the defunct TLC documentary series ""I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant.""

How could you not know you're pregnant? She thought.

“I used to call bull on that until it happened to me.""

Fear

After getting past the initial shock, Michele Hall became fearful.

The odds were stacked against her. She had lupus, pre-existing high blood pressure and late prenatal care. Throw her age into the mix.

Was her baby going to be all right?

She saw doctors regularly in the two months leading up to the delivery at NCH North Naples Hospital on Dec. 27. Since her pregnancy was considered high-risk, she underwent a scheduled cesarean delivery, or C-section, in lieu of a natural birth.

Before delivery, doctors believed her baby was roughly 37 weeks old, but that number was just a guesstimate, given that Michele Hall wasn't sure when she conceived him. Following his birth, she was told he was about 34 to 35 weeks old. A full-term pregnancy lasts between 39 and 40 weeks, according to March of Dimes.

Naples obstetrician Dr. Thomas “Tom” Beckett first met Michele Hall at his office on Dec. 20, only a week before delivering her son. He runs his own practice and is also a provider with the Healthcare Network of Southwest Florida.

Hall beat his previous record of age 48 for the oldest patient he'd ever delivered a baby for in his 30-year career. ""Fifty was a whole new decade for me.""

Beckett said there are cases where women, in their 30s or 40s, become pregnant after being told their chances were slim.

In Hall's case, he added, ""She just released that one egg that did it.""

Although she wasn't expecting to have a baby at this stage in life, Hall said she knows how lucky she is. Many women around her age pay top-dollar to have a child via in vitro fertilization. She did it the old-fashioned way.

The most common cause of age-related decline in fertility is less-frequent ovulation. As women age, they begin to have occasional cycles where an egg is never released. Miscarriage is also more common in women over the age of 35, according to the American Pregnancy Association.

Hall felt alone. Were other women her age having unexpected pregnancies?

She took to social media and posted her story on a private Facebook Naples mom group, weeks before giving birth. Several moms liked and commented on her post, writing words of encouragement and support. A few, in their 40s, messaged her with similar stories, but no one her age.

In the weeks before giving birth, Hall took extreme care of herself, going to doctor appointments regularly and resting as much as she could.

When she'd go out in public, she said she started feeling a little self-conscious. Sometimes people would stare at her belly.

“A lot of older people would look at me and do a double take because they were probably trying to figure out if I was as old as they thought I was,” she said.

But she had a strong support system.

Michele learned about her pregnancy on Oct. 8, 2018, and at that point she was 26 weeks into her pregnancy. At 50, Michele never thought she would have another child after Aubrey, her youngest. But, on Dec. 27, 2018, baby Grayson Matthew Hall was born at NCH North Naples Hospital. (Photo: Srijita Chattopadhyay/Naples Daily News)

Excitement

Flowery wrapped boxes and bags of baby toys and gear piled up in the corner of a multipurpose room at Vineyards Community Park in Naples. It was Dec. 15. Hall was expecting any day now and, to celebrate, friends threw her a baby shower.

After the initial shock and fear, she was excited.

""This baby signals a new beginning,” she said.

The Halls left most of their family and friends behind in Pennsylvania, so for a while it was just the three of them. Now they were expecting a new member of the family and had a supportive community around them.

At the shower, neighbors, fellow home-school teachers and ice skating friends of Aubrey's celebrated with food, gifts and hugs. Hall's children, except Aubrey, couldn't make it to the shower, but she communicated regularly with them throughout the pregnancy

""She's a trouper,"" neighbor and friend Robin Currence said of Michele.

A friend, Lynda Rowley, learned the mom-to-be was pregnant in the car on the way to an ultrasound appointment. Hall had asked Rowley to take her somewhere that day but didn't break the news until they were already on their way.

""I was so surprised,"" Rowley said.

During the shower, Hall was all smiles. Her growing belly was visible underneath a loose dress. She was feeling pretty good, except for the swelling in her feet and ankles and on-and-off heart palpitations.

The Halls grew emotional as they opened their gifts, revealing bath sets, a diaper bag, clothes, booties and a baby bouncer.

""I'm ready to meet him,"" Michele Hall said.

They named their son Grayson. They originally chose the name Grace if it was a girl, but when they found out it was a boy, they altered it slightly.

""He'll be here by the grace of God,” she said.

Anxious

On Dec. 27, Michele Hall gave birth to her healthy baby boy at NCH North Naples Hospital off Immokalee Road.

Based on medical records for the past 10 years, it appears 53 is the age of the oldest woman who has given birth across all NCH Healthcare system locations, according to NCH spokesman Shawn McConnell. It wasn't known whether that baby was conceived naturally.

Due to it being a high-risk pregnancy, Beckett had ordered a C-section. Michele Hall never had surgery before. The idea frightened her, but she had no choice.

The longer she carried the baby, the doctor said, the higher the risk of her suffering from cardiac issues or seizures.

Grayson weighed a little more than 6 pounds and measured 19 inches long.

Following his birth, Grayson suffered one sleep apnea episode and several episodes where he had a slower heart rate, or bradycardia. He was kept under surveillance at the hospital's newborn intensive care unit for 12 days.

He also suffered from transient tekipnia of the newborn, a term for a temporary mild respiratory problem of babies that begins after birth.

Those 12 days were tough on the Halls.

“It goes through your mind that something can go wrong,"" Michele Hall said, tearing up. She looked down at Grayson finally in her arms at the NICU more than a week after the C-section, on Jan. 5. He was released two days later.

She couldn't see her son for days following the delivery. When she finally could, she never strayed too far. When she was discharged from the hospital on New Year's Eve, her and her husband stayed at the NICU to celebrate with their newborn.

Most nights the couple stayed in an overflow room, a short walk from Grayson's curtained-off room. When they went home for a short break, they still kept an eye on him through the NICU camera system.

Hopeful

Grayson sleeps deeply, nestled in the arms of his mother on a Sunday afternoon in early February at their Golden Gate Estates home. At nearly 2 months old, he finally outgrew his premature clothes and weighed about 8 pounds.

He's a quiet baby, crying occasionally only. His favorite hobbies are eating and sleeping.

""He sleeps like a log,"" Michele Hall said.

After cradling the sleeping baby for more than an hour, she passed him to Aubrey, who gladly took the role of the older sister. She sat on the sofa and expertly fed him milk as Food Network's ""Guy's Grocery Games"" played on the living room TV. Aubrey had rehearsed the role when her nieces were infants.

The only sound was the TV — until Aubrey yelled: ""Not it!"" She wrinkled her nose as a strong smell emanated from Grayson's diaper.

""Not it,"" repeated her father, who was in another room.

It was Michele's turn for diaper duty.

The Halls have adjusted to their new normal, and so have their yellow Lab Milly, cat Luna and pet turtles.

""Now we're just settling back into our regular lives after a chaotic 12 to 13 weeks,"" Michele Hall said.

Before Grayson arrived home, on Jan. 7, the Halls were able to transform their guest bedroom into a woodlands-themed nursery. Stuffed foxes and bears adorned the room. A drawing his sister did with his name on it and images of furry critters hung on the wall over the crib.

The first night at home was the toughest, said Michele Hall, who didn't get much sleep. She was too worried, given everything that had happened at the NICU.

If anything were to happen, the Halls learned CPR from a first responder neighbor. Luckily, they haven't had to use it.

Michele Hall, who turns 51 in May, won't be having any more children. She made sure of that. During the C-section, Beckett removed her fallopian tubes.

""I'm 100 percent sure I'm not having any more kids,"" she said, even though she's so grateful for her miracle baby. ""He's a blessing.""

1424,Florida youth pastor accused of sexting 15-year-old girl,"BELLEVIEW, Fla. - A Florida youth pastor is accused of sending sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl in his youth group, officials with the Marion County Sheriff's Office said.

Deputies arrested Christopher Lee Patrick, 30, on Tuesday after a parent told a Marion County high school resource officer that a 15-year-old girl had inappropriate messages on her phone from Patrick, News4Jax sister station WKMG reports.

A witness told deputies that they recognized the phone number because Patrick, who is a youth pastor at Grace Baptist Church, would pick up the 15-year-old victim and other girls and drive them to church.

Patrick and his wife are the junior high youth leaders at the Belleview church, according to the Grace Baptist Church Facebook page.

Text messages from Patrick to the girl were graphic in nature and discussed sexual encounters, deputies said. The suspect discussed things he wanted to do to the 15-year-old ""the next time we are alone.""

Several photos of a man's penis were sent to the girl, deputies found in text messages.

1426,Backyard shooting ranges spark debate in Golden Gate Estates,"CLOSE Members of the public practice shooting at the Collier County Sheriff's Office's gun range, which is open every first and third Saturday of the month Alex Driehaus, Naples Daily News

In Golden Gate Estates — where residents have long been drawn to large, affordable lots and privacy away from the bustle of the urban coast — a fight over backyard shooting ranges has been brewing.

Local officials say a sweeping state law prevents them from regulating what some see as a growing public safety concern.

Collier County used to have a variety of local ordinances on the books that kept recreational shooting in neighborhoods in check, but a 2011 law backed by the National Rifle Association forced county officials to repeal those rules.

Though local governments had been preempted from passing ordinances regulating firearms for decades, the 2011 law threatened city and county officials who defied the state with hefty fines and even removal from office.

Since then, law enforcement officials say they have seen an increase in incidents related to makeshift shooting ranges in the sprawling subdivision with stray bullets damaging property and, in a couple of cases, injuring neighbors.

Deputies want residents to exercise their rights safely, but because the state statute doesn’t spell out what residents have to do to shoot recreationally on their property, as long as it’s “reasonably safe,” law enforcement officials are left with few options, said Lt. Gary Martin, the Collier County’s Sheriff’s Office’s Golden Gates Estates commander.

And the definition of safe can be subjective, Martin said.

“We had a guy, I believe it was last year, that was shooting a rifle through a mattress. He thought it was safe,” he said. “We’ve had people shooting into buckets. We’ve had people shooting into piles of mulch.”

For deputies, Martin said, the issue becomes a public safety concern when other people’s property is damaged or people feel their life is in danger because of their neighbor’s shooting habits.

Related: Backyard shooting ranges fall through enforcement cracks

A Golden Gate Estates man who deputies say struck a neighbor in her residence while he was firing a handgun in his backyard for target practice was arrested in late December. Days later, the polarizing issue sparked dueling petitions online and heated discussions on social media.

An online petition from a Golden Gate Estates resident calling for stricter rules to regulate so-called backyard shooting ranges on one-acre properties has garnered more than 1,000 signatures since Jan. 3.

“People feel like it sounds like a war zone sometimes,” said George Guyer, who started the petition, referring to those who have commented online. The police officer and longtime Golden Gate Estates resident is worried about the well-being of his teenage daughter and others.

“It’s not about the Second Amendment,” said Guyer, 47. “I just want people to be safe.”

Opponents to an outright ban fired off their own salvo of petitions soon after Guyer started his.

One advocates to keep the existing rules, but change berm and distance requirements instead, and enforce stricter punishments for those who violate laws.

“Keep the law for shooting, for those of us that abide by the rules and know what we are doing,” the petition states. It was started by Golden Gate Estates resident Brandon Garcia and has garnered more than 200 signatures since Jan. 7.

Garcia, a sergeant in the Florida Army National Guard who has a berm in his own backyard and regularly shoots there, said he understands other residents’ concerns.

He said he wanted to look for a “middle ground” approach that would satisfy both sides. A starting point could be requiring berms to be at least 6 feet high, said Garcia, 37.

Another petition, created on Jan. 6 by Dan Huffman, asks County Commissioner Bill McDaniel, whose district includes Golden Gate Estates, to support backyard shooting ranges.

“Many moved out to the Golden Gate Estates for the freedom of open spaces and against the restrictions of the rest of Collier County!” the online petition states.

“This is a rural area so don't let the knee jerk reactions of those who do not understand this impose restrictions on those who want to continue using the Estates and not have unnecessary restrictions placed on it! This includes responsible people and their use of THEIR property for backyard ranges!”

More than 350 people have signed that petition, which has since been closed. Efforts to reach Huffman were unsuccessful, but in an update on the petition website he asks supporters to get the word out “before there is one more thing lost” to the Estates area.

McDaniel has heard his constituents' concerns. But there’s likely not much the county can do about it.

“It’s a statutorily pre-empted process,” McDaniel said in an interview earlier this year. “We’re not allowed to meddle with the backyard shooting.”

Incidents increased in 2018

Martin, with CCSO, said deputies patrolling the Golden Gate Estates district have seen an uptick in incidents related to backyard shooting ranges since the county had to roll back its local ordinances.

The Golden Gate Estates substation began to informally keep track of backyard shooting range incidents in 2017, said Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Michelle Batten.

In 2017, there were eight incidents in Golden Gate Estates. The following year that number climbed to 15. (Because the numbers are based on an informal tally, the actual number of incidents could be higher, Batten said.)

When deputies get a call about somebody’s property being struck, they try to track down the shooter based on the trajectory or the noise, if the firing is still occurring, Martin said.

“In a lot of cases, they’re very apologetic, they can’t believe that what they were doing caused damage to somebody else’s property,” Martin said. “And oftentimes the neighbors in some way, work it out themselves.”

Even ranges that appear to be set up safely at first glance can be problematic.

Deputies have encountered instances where residents have “range quality” berms, but then place targets that stick out above the berm, Martin said. One resident had a 6-foot-tall dirt berm, but the upper part of the target, “what would’ve been the head and shoulders,” reached over the top of the berm, he recalled.

“So when he was shooting at them, he was actually shooting over the berm,” Martin said.

And at times there are consequences more serious than damaged property.

The 21-year-old woman who was struck in December told deputies she was sitting at her dinner table next to a window when she heard a crash and felt something strike her right arm and side. She suffered a laceration to her arm and broken skin and bruising to her right side, and was treated at a hospital, according to a Sheriff’s Office report.

In 2016, a 14-year-old girl was injured when a man who was shooting at a small berm in a backyard in Golden Gate Estates accidentally struck a neighbor’s home. The girl’s family told the Daily News at the time that if the bullet hadn’t hit her left hand, breaking a couple of bones, it could have hit her mother's face, neck or shoulder.

“The lots are real narrow and real long, so your neighbors could be close depending on what direction you’re shooting,” Martin said.

When people ask him about backyard shooting ranges, Martin said he recommends they consider their civil liability if an accident happens and to “very objectively” inspect their target “from all angles.”

“Walk around to the other side and if you believe that it’s safe to shoot at it from the opposite side where your loved ones and your house and your property’s at, then perhaps it’s safe enough for you to shoot at from the side that you’re considering,” he said.

‘Education, not regulation'

For their part, county officials say their hands are tied. And with the threat of sanctions hanging over their heads if they were to regulate the issue, some have been reluctant to even discuss the matter.

When McDaniel proposed to bring an agenda item forward to discuss some ideas, Klatzkow, the county attorney, advised against it.

“I think it's a terrible idea. I'm sorry ...,” he told commissioners at the Jan. 22 meeting. “They could remove you from the dais. Now, I've never seen a preemption statute quite like that in my life.”

Instead, McDaniel said he wants to reach out to the sheriff and “see if we can develop a set of recommendations from an educational perspective just to enhance the health, safety and welfare of those facilities.”

Having a town hall meeting on the issue and increasing hours of operation at a Sheriff’s Office-run public gun range off Oil Well Grade Road have also been discussed, although the latter could be complicated by potential development that is planned in the area, McDaniel said.

The Sheriff’s Office gun range is currently open to the public from 8 a.m. to noon the first and third Saturday of each month, according to the Sheriff’s Office website. It allows only pistols and handguns.

“Education, not regulation, is the premise of what we're, in fact, talking about,” he said.

But some think even that could backfire.

“I would also caution that when you start to educate the public about the restrictions, you're also going to be educating a lot of people that might want to have backyard shooting ranges,” said Commissioner Burt Saunders during the January meeting. “They're going to find out that they're legal.”

‘A split issue’

When Guyer, whose petition sparked spirited debates on social media, first moved to Golden Gate Estates 15 years ago there were rules in place that prohibited the practice. He said he thinks it should be that way again.

“I want something done about it,” he said. “There’s just too much risk on a one-acre property.”

Guyer said he would like to see the density requirements changed from one acre or more to 2 ½ or 5 acres. He also proposes a permitting and inspection process to make sure the shooting is done safely.

“It’s clearly a safety issue,” he said. “And it’s a quality of life issue.”

Guyer knows that change will likely have to happen on a state level. He sent state Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Naples, and state Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, an email about the issue.

“Basically I just got the run-around,” he said.

Usually a tragedy sparks change, Guyer said. “I’m trying to prevent that before it happens,” he said.

For Garcia, the Golden Gate Estates resident who started a petition seeking a happy medium solution, being able to shoot on his property is one of the reasons he moved to the rural subdivision.

He said he shoots “probably once a month,” sometimes twice. At times, his friends come to join him.

Shooting at commercial ranges can get “pretty pricey” and many who shoot don’t want to drive that far, Garcia said.

Still, he understands others’ concerns.

“What if a round hits my son?” Garcia said. “How would I feel then?”

He said it’s the ones who don’t know how to be safe with guns that ruin it for others.

“Most gun owners, they take safety pretty seriously,” Garcia said.

Martin, the Sheriff’s Office lieutenant, said the topic of backyard shooting ranges is “kind of a split issue.”

“People want to be able to go out in the backyard and shoot,” he said. “They just have to be safe when they’re doing (it). They have to consider that the Estates is still populated.”

1427,"Roundabout eyed to ease busy Gateway intersections, but some fear confusion","Fort Myers Roundabout -- Planned for the intersection of First and Seaboard streets and Palm Beach Boulevard (Photo: SPECIAL TO THE NEWS-PRESS)

More homes, more businesses and more traffic have proven to be a formula for more traffic accidents and more congestion in the Gateway Community east of Fort Myers, may force residents and visitors to either work through their panic attacks over maneuvering roundabouts or spend more time and gas waiting for lights to change.

Lee County transportation managers say the increased traffic on roads in Gateway are causing spikes in the number of accidents and it's time to make some changes to make travel safer.

The experts say it is time for the modern convenience of traffic control to come to a couple of busy intersections in the complex laid out by Westinghouse Gateways Communities Inc. more than 35 years ago.

Contemporary News-Press reports referred to the area as a controversial development of ""5,567 desolate acres"" on which ""the most important development"" county officials had ever dealt with, could jeopardize Lee County's water supply.

County Commissioners will be asked to approve nearly $375,000 for traffic studies at Gateway Boulevard and Griffin Drive and at the boulevard and Commerce Lakes Drive with an eye toward building roundabouts or installing traffic lights at the intersection.

""Over the past few years, traffic volumes have increased to the point where (the intersections have) become a traffic crash problem,"" said Rancy Cerchie, the county transportation director in a memorandum to commissioners.

The county has reported 33 traffic crashes, 24 of them T-bone accidents, at Griffin and Gateway from 2015-18. The Commerce Lakes and Gateway intersection has seen 75 crashes, with 50 of them the dangerous T-bone right angle crash.

""A review of possible traffic control changes showed that a roundabout is the best alternative in improving safety without adding excessive delays,"" Cerchie wrote. ""A traffic signal would improve safety but motorists would have longer delays.""

""The traffic situation at those intersections is very serious, we’ve had a number of accidents, but none fatal,thankfully,"" said Bill Guy, vice chair of the elected Gateway Services Community Development District Board of Supervisors.

The idea that installing the circular merge maneuver on Gateway roads as a safety measure is not something Guy is ready to embrace.

""I would be in favor of a traffic light or other device as opposed to roundabouts,"" he said. ""I know that some of the engineers think they are wonderful but take up an awful lot of ground and it takes a lot of time for people to get used to it.""

Advocates of roundabouts for some intersections say they reduce the amount of time people sit and wait at intersections after all the cross-traffic that is going to pass during the light cycle has gone through.

A county spokesman said the recommendation was based on traffic projections extending to 2040, suggesting that roundabouts are considered a solution for the next two decades.

Gateway has grown to more than 10,000 people, according to some estimates, an increase of nearly 20 percent since the 2010 census. With an average age in the early 40s for both men and women, much of the community is family-oriented which means more daily traffic trips for everything from Girl Scout cookie sales to proms.

Several new businesses have located in Gateway and across Daniels Parkway from its southern entrance, the Lee Port Authority continues to develop its Skyplex complex which has the potential to inspire traffic to use Gateway as a convenient shortcut to the north or east via State Road 82

Gartner Inc. has expended its space in Gateway and is one of several companies looking at space across Daniels Parkway in a business park being developed on Southwest Florida International Airport land. The Gartner campus at Skyplex has room for another building.

Alta Resources LLC, which operates call centers, is also expanding on to the airport's Skyplex park, which is expected to add around 800 new jobs.

Still being considered for the airport property is a 400-acre motorsports complex, which a Port Authority spokeswoman says is still going through preliminary evaluations by both the investor and the airport.

Roundabouts have been widely accepted but are still controversial in some places. The Estero Village Council rejected three roundabouts on Estero Parkway to leave room for two lanes of traffic.

County Commissioners are being asked to approve close to $375,000 for the needed work to design the two intersections.

1428,"He’s just like any other boy, except that he let his hair grown down to his back. Here’s why he did it.","Please enable Javascript to watch this video

WEST JORDAN, Utah – A Utah boy is helping other kids by growing out and giving away his own hair - with a personal reason for his unique way of giving back. On Thursday afternoon, Morgan Gero indulged in a round of Apex Legends in his bedroom as one hand furiously clicked away on the keyboard and the other made quick movements with the mouse.

Morgan enjoys video games, and a quick look around his room shows something else he loves – Star Wars.

""The force is strong with this one,"" bold lettering states above his window as a life-size cutout of Anakin Skywalker stares down from one of the walls.

It's clear Morgan is like any other 12-year-old boy – but some people mistake him for a girl. It's because Morgan's hair flows down to the middle of his back.

""It's annoying when people just think I'm a girl,"" he said. ""Usually when I go into the boys bathroom, people kind of look at me funny. Even the adults look at me funny. They're like, 'What are you doing in this bathroom?'""

What Morgan's doing is growing his hair out for kids who lost theirs because of medical issues and treatments.

""Those kids who really need hair,"" he said. ""So yeah. I could help them out.""

After two years, Morgan's locks have reached the right length to donate to Wigs for Kids.

His mother, Sandrine Gero, took Morgan to chop off 12 inches Thursday afternoon.

""Alright, you ready?"" hairdresser Marion Gallagher asked before she separated the hair into small pony tails, and snipped them off one-by-one.

The process was pretty painless, and important – especially for a kid who has suffered some serious medical problems of his own.

""I was born earlier than I was supposed to [be born],"" Morgan said. Sandrine said she went into labor at 27 weeks. Morgan lived his first weeks of life in the NICU, and Sandrine said he almost didn't survive.

""It was really hard. It was very traumatic for both me and my husband,"" Sandrine said. ""We did not know if he was actually going to live.""

Morgan beat the odds and didn't suffer any lifelong health conditions.

He knows other kids like him aren't as lucky, and he said he wants ""to help kids feel normal.""

This isn't the first time Morgan has donated his hair.

Four years ago, he began to grow his hair out. He donated it for the first time two years ago. Then, he started the process again.

Even though Morgan said it will be nice to not get any more weird looks with his new short haircut, he plans to keep going.

Morgan will grow his hair out a third time as he continues to give back to this cause.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/03/15/hes-just-like-any-other-boy-except-that-he-let-his-hair-grown-down-to-his-back-heres-why-he-did-it/,2019-03-15T18:37:57Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394
1429,Celebrate women during March and beyond,"Rev. Candace McKibben (Photo: Candace McKibben)

I was standing in the outdoor gardening area of the Home Depot trying to decide between New Guinea Impatiens and Pentas for the flower bed I was creating for my son and daughter-in-law, when I realized that NPR was playing over the sound system. I do not usually go to the Home Depot during the week and at such an early hour, and am not accustomed to hearing talk radio in the gardening section.

Maybe it was my wonderment at hearing talk rather than music, but it was as if I heard for the first time the disclaimer I have probably heard thousands of times about public radio not discriminating against a number of groups, including women. “Women?” I said out loud to no one. It felt archaic, insensitive, even ridiculous in 2019 to have to make such a disclaimer.

Though I have certainly felt my share of discrimination as a woman in ministry through the years, hearing this disclaimer felt particularly poignant and painful to me that misty morning in Jacksonville at the Home Depot.

On Friday of that same week, I was listening to NPR where I am accustomed to hearing it, in my car on the way to work, when I heard a remarkable story for International Women’s Day on Morning Edition.

It had aired originally on Jan. 14, 2019, on All Things Considered, and I understand why the editors found it worthy of broadcasting again. Featuring the anthem, “Quiet,” written by artist MILCK (Connie Lim), the program detailed how and why the song was written and how it has taken on a life of its own around the world since discovered at the Women’s March in Washington in 2017.

Connie Lim co-wrote “Quiet” in 2015 as a way to help her cope with being sexually assaulted and abused when she was a teenager. She thought of it as her personal therapy song, reminding her to speak out no matter what about things that matter. In the interview on NPR, Connie recalled how as a child she had been taught “to sit properly, to speak less, to smile more, to lose weight and just be this perfect little girl.” After a haunting dream in 2015 in which she told her abuser that she could not keep quiet, she was encouraged to translate the wisdom of her dream into a song.

The next year during the 2016 Presidential campaign, Connie found herself reliving some of her earlier trauma because of the ways in which women were being portrayed by some covered in the national media. In response, she decided to share her song with a broader audience. She invited some a Capella singers in Washington, DC to join her at the March to sing it.

Though not on stage, they captured the attention and hearts of many women there as they sang the song repeatedly to any audience they could generate as they wandered amidst the massive crowd. A filmmaker in the crowd captured the singers on her cell phone and her post went viral. Today the anthem has been sung around the world and translated into other languages, deeply resonating in the hearts of women of many different places and cultures.

I know that when I heard this broadcast on NPR on International Women’s Day, I was moved to tears. You can hear the song at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZD05-ZvQFs

Inspired by International Women’s Day, March is National Women’s History Month. The month-long celebration started as a local week-long celebration in Santa Rosa County, California, in 1978. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter issued the first Presidential Proclamation declaring March 8-14 as the first National Women’s History Week. He noted that though men and women have built our nation, too often women are unsung and their contributions go unnoticed.

Carter affirmed that, “the achievements, leadership, courage, strength and love of the women who built America is as vital as that of the men whose names we know so well.” In 1987 Congress declared that a month, rather than a week, be devoted to Women’s History and since that time we have as a nation celebrated National Women’s History Month in March.

In our own community during March for the last 13 years, we have honored 25 women to know and, more recently, five young women to watch, celebrating the ways in which their achievements, leadership, courage, strength and love have enhanced our lives. It is a beautiful gesture but we know that there are thousands of unsung heroes who deserve our respect and admiration, not only for what they have accomplished, but simply for who they are as human beings.

Discrimination is a painful experience for all who know it and the more we can all do to give everyone a voice and a sense of belonging, the richer we all will be. During March and beyond let the girls and women in your life know how much they matter.

The Rev. Candace McKibben is an ordained minister who serves as the director of faith outreach at Big Bend Hospice and as pastor of Tallahassee Fellowship.

1430,25 Women: Tracy Thomas blazes a trail with heart and soul,"CLOSE Meet the 25 Women You Need to Know in March. Tallahassee Democrat

Tracy Thomas grew up on a 40-acre farm just outside Tallahassee. When she talks about the property, it seems to spring up around her.

She is the eldest of roughly 50 cousins she would see on Sundays when the families gathered for church.

“We were busy, as kids. We fished a lot. We played outdoor games. We just had fun,” Thomas says.

Thomas is a 50-year-old professor of physical therapy at Florida A&M University. She is one of the 25 Women You Need to Know. Now in its 13th year, the program is the Tallahassee Democrat’s way of honoring women who lead. Look for their profiles during March in print and see videos on tallahassee.com.

By Mother’s Day this year, Thomas will have completed her second doctorate, which may make her the only African-American woman in the nation to have a doctorate in both pharmaceutical sciences and physical therapy.

But Thomas’s path hasn’t been without its obstacles. When she first started as an undergraduate student at FAMU on an academic scholarship, Thomas flunked out of her pharmacy school program.

“Of those several grandchildren in our family, that was just unheard of. And so, while there were people that were, like, ‘Well, we knew she wasn’t going to’…my mother just never gave up,” Thomas says.

A couple years later, Thomas sailed through that same course again in graduate school with flying colors and set the curve for her class. With her exam pinned to her scrubs, a score of 105 out of 100, Thomas went to the nursing home where she and her mother both worked.

There was a brief exchange where Thomas’s mother asked what an exam was doing pinned to her daughter’s scrubs and a proud young Thomas boasted about her new scores in the class.

“And she goes, ‘Huh, you could’ve done that all along,’ and walked off!” Thomas says.

She laughs at the memory.

“That’s my mom. I have since learned that she would literally be just beaming to other people. But to show me?”

Thomas shakes her head. She says her mom never wanted her to get a big head.

The first thing Thomas notices about other people is how they carry themselves — if they’re “warm and open, and if they’re approachable.”

Thomas’s grandmother passed down to the young girl an appreciation for storytelling, especially for the stories in the Bible, her favorite book.

“Growing up in the country without cable television, she would tell me (the Bible) has the best stories,” she says. And her favorite movie is, “hands down, ‘The Color Purple.’”

The advice Thomas has for young people comes from her Christian upbringing and the stories her grandmother cultivated within her.

“Trust God, trust the process, never give up on yourself. For me, that has been key,” Thomas says. “I can now say that all the little phrases that my grandmother used to say to me — ‘there’s nothing too hard for God. Try him and believe Him.’ — I used to be like, hmm, OK. But I know those things to be true now.”

Less than 24 hours after winning the race for West Palm Beach mayor, Keith James said he can’t wait to get started.“I was the one candidate that really felt bullish on West Palm Beach and felt that we should maintain our momentum,” James said in a one-on-one interview with WPBF 25 News.James said he has three top priorities.One is adding more affordable housing in the city.Another is reducing violent crime by encouraging police officers to be more involved.“Rather than driving through some of these neighborhoods with the windows up, air conditioning on, they need to get out of the cars and interact with the community,” James said.James’ third priority is curing the city’s homelessness problem.He said he wants to remain compassionate but not just to the homeless.“We need to respect the rights of the private businesspeople and folks who just want to enjoy some of our public spaces, and so we’ll have an enforcement element,” James said.On another note, James also said he does not underestimate the significance of his victory.While there have been other African-Americans to serve as mayor of West Palm Beach, they were all elected to the City Council and then appointed as mayor in what was mostly a ceremonial position.James is the first African-American to be elected to the office of mayor of West Palm Beach.“I hope it inspires young people, African-American young people, little boy or little girl, to say, ‘You know what?

1436,Dozens of K-9 units visit terminally ill Wisconsin girl who loves dogs,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

HARTLAND, Wis. – A terminally ill Wisconsin girl who adores dogs got a visit over the weekend from more than 35 K-9 teams from across the state.

Emma Mertens, a 7-year-old who was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor, has received countless letters of encouragements and photos of pups from all around the world – but this Saturday she got to meet dozens of police dogs in person.

Officers and their furry counterparts were all smiles as they greeted Emma and her family, posing for plenty of photos.

""There are no words....Pure Joy!,"" reads a post on Team Emma's Facebook page. ""Thank you to everyone who took the time to organize and participate in this.""

In late January, Mertens was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a rare brain tumor. A family friend thought it would be nice to raise the spirits of the little animal lover with a letter from her dog. She asked her friends to do the same.

Mertens has received more than 75,000 well wishes from across the world. Team Emma's GoFundMe has raised nearly $125,000.

The former Naples High School teacher accused of sex crimes against two students pleaded no contest Tuesday in one of two cases he is facing.

Around July 16, 2017, Smith requested to follow a girl on Instagram. Through Instagram direct messages, he told her to delete the message thread and add him on Snapchat, according to an arrest report.

The girl then added Smith to her Snapchat account, and Smith sent her lewd messages, the report states. Smith sent the girl a photo, via Snapchat, of himself nude, standing in front of a bathroom mirror brushing his teeth, according to the report.

Smith then requested that the girl send him a photo, the report states. He continued to message the girl through Snapchat for about a week and told her ""that he was free in the mornings to meet for sex"" when his wife would be out of town, according to the report.

Collier Circuit Judge Ramiro Mañalich did not sentence Smith on Tuesday; sentencing is set for May 9, court documents show.

In another case which is to be set for trial, the former teacher faces two felony charges of engaging in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17 years old, court documents show. The girl in the case is expected to be at an April 29 hearing.

Smith told investigators that he had sexual intercourse with the girl in a bathroom where she was employed, the arrest report states.

Smith was arrested on Aug. 14, 2017, after an investigation from the Collier County Sheriff's Office and the state Department of Children and Families.

Smith was hired by Collier County Public Schools in 2011 and worked at Naples High School for six years prior to his arrest. He also was a coach for the school's football team.

After School Board members approved his dismissal at a Sept. 26, 2017, meeting, Smith was fired, then-Collier school district spokesman Greg Turchetta said at the time.

1439,US pulls all diplomatic staff from Venezuela amid unfolding horror,"A view of the facade of the American embassy in Caracas on Jan. 24, 2019, in Caracas, Venezuela.

CARACAS, Venezuela - The U.S. said late Monday that it is pulling its last remaining diplomats from Venezuela, saying their continued presence at the country's embassy in Caracas had become a ""constraint"" on U.S. policy as the Trump administration aggressively looks to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro.

The announcement came from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a tweet shortly before midnight comes as Venezuela struggles to restore electricity following four days of blackouts around the country.

The U.S. has led an international effort to replace Maduro with opposition leader Juan Guaido, who vows to hold a new presidential election. Guaido is backed by some 50 countries, while Maduro maintains support from countries such as China, Russia and Cuba.

Maduro ordered all U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela in late January because of its support for Guaido, but he later retreated and allowed them to stay. The U.S. still withdrew the bulk of embassy personnel, leaving a skeletal staff led by career foreign service officer James Story.

Pompeo said the remaining diplomats would be out of Venezuela by the end of the week but gave no indication of future policy steps despite past warnings that ""all options"" - including the use of military force - are on the table for removing Maduro.

The move came after another day of chaos as power outages that began Thursday evening continued to cause problems for Venezuelans, leaving them with little power, water and communications.

People converged on a polluted river to fill water bottles in Caracas, and scattered protests erupted in several cities

A 3-year-old girl with a brain tumor languished in a Caracas hospital, awaiting treatment after doctors started surgery but then suspended the operation when nationwide power outages first hit on Thursday, said the girl's fearful mother, who only gave her first name, Yalimar.

""The doctors told me that there are no miracles,"" said Yalimar, who hopes her daughter can be transferred Tuesday to one of the few hospitals in Venezuela that would be able to finish the complex procedure.

The girl's story highlighted an unfolding horror in Venezuela, where years of hardship got abruptly worse after the power grid collapsed. On Monday, schools and businesses were closed, long lines of cars waited at the few gasoline stations with electricity and hospitals cared for many patients without power. Generators have alleviated conditions for some of the critically ill.

President Nicolas Maduro said on national television Monday night that progress had been made in restoring power in Venezuela. He also said two people who were allegedly trying to sabotage power facilities were captured and were providing information to authorities, though he gave no details.

Guaido, who heads the opposition-controlled congress, and the United States say Maduro's claims that the U.S. sabotaged the power grid with a ""cyberattack"" are an attempt to divert attention from the government's own failings.

There have been acts of kindness during Venezuela's crisis: People whose food would rot in refrigerators without power donated it to a restaurant, which cooked it for distribution to charities and hospitals.

The blackouts also have hit the oil industry. The country hasn't shipped $358 million in oil since the power failures started, and ""the whole system is grinding to a halt,"" said Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets.

Two large tankers are sitting empty at the Jose offshore oil-loading dock, and at least 19 other ships are waiting their turns there, Dallen said.

Engineers have restored power in some parts of Venezuela, but it often goes out again. There have been a few protests in Caracas and reports of similar anti-government anger elsewhere. Guaido tweeted about reports of looting in some cities, but details were difficult to confirm.

Security forces in the city of Maracaibo dispersed ""criminals"" trying to take advantage of the power cuts, Mayor Willy Casanova told local media. However, numerous videos posted on social media that purported to be from Maracaibo showed crowds roaming the streets and people running from looted, damaged buildings with no police in sight.

In Caracas, some people reported more sightings of ""colectivos,"" a term for armed groups allegedly operating on behalf of the state to intimidate opponents.

The mood in Caracas was desperate.

Marian Morales, a nurse working for a Catholic youth group, and several colleagues handed out diapers and food from a car parked near a hospital. Police and men in civilian clothing ordered them to leave, saying they didn't have permission.

Morales said the needy are cautious about approaching to collect the handouts because of the presence of security forces.

Early Monday, an explosion rocked a power station in the Baruta area of Caracas. Residents gathered to look at the charred, smoldering equipment.

Guaido said three of four electricity transformers servicing the area were knocked out. He has blamed the blackouts on government corruption and mismanagement.

Winston Cabas, the head of Venezuela's electrical engineers union, which opposes the government, disputed government allegations that the country's main hydroelectric dam was sabotaged last week. He blamed a lack of maintenance as well as the departure of skilled workers from the troubled country over the years.

""The system is vulnerable, fragile and unstable,"" he said.

Spain's airline pilots union asked for Spanish airline Air Europa to stop flying to Venezuela after one of its crews was attacked at gunpoint in Caracas. The Sepla union said two pilots and eight more crew members of a flight from Madrid were assaulted on Saturday while going from the airport to their hotel in the Venezuelan capital. None of the crew members was injured.

Air Europa responded by ordering the crews of flights to Venezuela to not spend the night in the country, according to the union.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on a Moscow-based bank jointly owned by Russian and Venezuelan state-owned companies, alleging it tried to circumvent U.S. sanctions on the South American country. The U.S. said it is targeting Evrofinance Mosnarbank for supporting Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company previously targeted by sanctions in January.

Evrofinance said it was carrying out its activities normally despite the announcement and pledged to ""meet its obligations to the clients and partners in full.""

The U.S. and the other governments that recognize Guaido as Venezuela's interim president say Maduro wasn't legitimately re-elected last year because opposition candidates weren't permitted to run. Maduro says he is the target of a U.S. coup plot.

A mother accused of fatally stabbing her 11-year-old daughter more than a dozen times Sunday did so because she thought the girl had been having sex, according to an arrest affidavit. Orange County Sheriff’s Office investigators said 28-year-old Rosa Alcides Rivera pulled up to Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies on Sunday asking for help for her 11-year-old daughter. Police said medical staffers checked on the girl and determined that Aleyda Rivera was dead.

Police said she admitted to killing her daughter and can be heard on police body camera recordings saying “my baby is gone.” The hospital was briefly locked down and the main entrance remained closed during the incident.Rosa Rivera later told investigators she killed her daughter to ""prevent her from having sex"" with men, the affidavit said. She's charged with first-degree murder. Investigators said the girl had been stabbed 15 times and they believe it happened inside Rosa Rivera's car. People at a home Citadel Drive told investigators Rivera had arrived around 7:30 a.m. Sunday and started pounding on the front door. The witnesses told investigators Rivera was accusing a man of having sex with her daughter. Investigators said Rivera has relatives who live in the Citadel Drive home and she was hoping to move into the house. Rivera told authorities she had never seen her daughter having sex and said her daughter never told her that she was having sex. Rivera is being held in the Orange County Jail without bond.

1447,"Orlando teacher accused of molesting student may have other victims, officials say","ORLANDO, Fla. - The Orange County elementary school teacher accused of molesting a student could have more possible victims, according to an arrest warrant.

Records show Julio Soto, 49, a teacher at Castle Creek Elementary School, was taken into custody last week after a student said Soto touched her inappropriately.

The girl, who sprained her arm in her physical education class last month, said Soto is her teacher for part of the day, normally for the afternoon portion, according to the warrant.

Because she was injured, she couldn't take part in the activities in her physical education class and was sitting out to the side when Soto approached her and asked her to come upstairs and fix her test, deputies said.

The girl told investigators she agreed to go with him to his classroom, which is located on the second floor, the warrant said.

When they got upstairs, Soto told the girl he was going to try to find her tickle spot and began touching her above her clothing and eventually underneath it, deputies said.

When she told him to stop, Soto replied, ""Oh, OK,"" and stopped, then did it again, and again stopped when she told him to, according to the warrant.

Soto went back to her desk while the girl finished her test. When she was done, he told her there were two minutes left of the physical education class and that she should go back downstairs, deputies said.

The girl said she asked Soto if anyone could see them in the classroom and he said they couldn't because a privacy paper was in place over the door, according to the warrant.

Deputies said the girl didn't initially tell her parents about the alleged incident because she was afraid of how they would react, but she eventually told her friends because she ""couldn't take it anymore,"" the warrant said.

Soto was taken into custody at a Publix shopping plaza located at the intersection of Chuluota Road and East Colonial Drive, about 2 miles away from the school.

Since his arrest, Soto has been placed on administrative leave and will not be placed in a classroom while there is an open internal investigation.

He's been teaching at Castle Creek Elementary since August 2015.

Parents on Monday didn't comment about the allegations but said they received a voicemail from Principal Monica Johnson about Soto's arrest.

""We take any and all allegations very seriously, and the safety of our students is my first priority,"" Johnson said in the recorded message.

Soto's defense attorney told an Orange County judge on Saturday that his client has no criminal history and is the father of an 11-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy.

Soto on Monday remained at the Orange County Jail without bond and has been ordered to stay away from the alleged victim and minors.

Officials said detectives are investigating possible other victims. Anyone with information is asked to call 407-836-4357.

1450,Wildwood's Hampton has secure legacy as he steps down,"Richard Hampton knew early on he wanted to be a basketball coach.

What the longtime Wildwood Middle High School girls coach didn’t know was the path his career would take and the lives he would eventually impact.

However, now that he has stepped down as coach and the curtain about to fall on a 30-year career as an educator at Wildwood — he is retiring at the end of the school year — Hampton has begun to reflect on a journey that includes countless accomplishments — and even a few disappointments.

“I’ve had a great run here,” Hampton said. “We’ve won a lot of basketball games over the years, but I’ve never considered that to be what I’m most proud of. For me, it has always been seeing the girls who have come through our program become responsible adults, wives and parents. We’ve also lost a few over the years — girls who didn’t make it through the program — and that has always bothered me because I wasn’t able to impact those kids in a positive manner.

“Winning a few basketball games along the way is great, but seeing these kids grow up into positive role models for their families and in their communities is what has made everything worthwhile.”

That Hampton considers his success on the basketball court to be secondary speaks volumes, considering his achievements in 15 years — over two stints — as the Wildcats’ girls coach.

Hampton’s recently completed seven-year run as coach on the Wildcats’ bench was the most successful in school history. It included back-to-back Class 1A state championships in 2017 and 2018 and three Final Four appearances (2015, 2017 and 2018).

In his first go-round as head coach, Hampton led the girls team from the 1991-92 season through the 1999-2000 campaign, taking them to the Final Four in 1994 and 1996, and finishing as Class 2A state runners-up in 1994.

Overall, Hampton’s coaching record at Wildwood is 268-164, including a sterling 128-44 mark from 2013 until 2019.

Since he hails from Kentucky, where basketball — college basketball, in particular — reigns supreme, it probably isn’t surprising that Hampton developed a passion for the sport as a youngster. He played the game as a student at Clay County High School and at the next level for Union College, an NAIA school in Barbourville, Kentucky.

At Clay County, Hampton played for longtime coach Bobby Keith, who won a state championship and more than 700 games in a coaching career that spanned 29 years — 27 of which were spent at Clay County.

Hampton said watching Keith inspired him to follow in the coach’s footsteps.

“I used a lot of what I learned from watching (Keith) throughout my career, all the way up through my last game,” Hampton said. “When I was a player, I would ask (Keith) why he called for a certain play at specific times. The ins and outs of the game always fascinated me and provided me with a motivation to try and fix things. For me, basketball was a chess game with life-size pieces and (Keith) taught me how to move those pieces.

“He was the epitome of a high school coach.”

With his playing days over and a college degree in hand, Hampton and his wife, Sherri, set out to make a life for themselves.

How did the couple end up in Wildwood?

“I’ve always considered it to be a little bit of a fate,” Hampton said.

Hampton’s mother in-law bought a house in Wildwood in the 1970s, which he said provided enough incentive for the young couple to make a trip to Sumter County to look for work.

“Within two weeks, we both had jobs,” Hampton said. “Sherri was at South Sumter and I was at Wildwood. And we’ve been here for the last 30 years.”

Hampton’s first foray into coaching was as an assistant for Wildwood’s boys team. After a couple of years in the second seat on the bench, head coaching positions for the boys and girls teams opened up and Hampton applied for the boys job.

When that didn’t pan out, Hampton applied for — and was named — Wildwood’s girls basketball coach.

“After that, the rest was history, I guess,” said Hampton, a wry smile creeping across his face. “I never thought much about coaching girls before I applied for the job and still not sure how ended up switching over to coaching girls. But I’m sure glad I did.”

Despite never having coached girls, Hampton quickly learned the difference between coaching boys and coaching girls. He was able to adapt and also used the lessons he had learned from his high school mentor.

“For me, girls always seemed to have an eagerness to learn,” Hampton said. “They appreciate the time you spend with them on and off the court and they really respond to coaching. I never really had a problem adjusting to coaching girls, because I was fortunate enough to have players who wanted to learn as much as I wanted to teach. It was a perfect marriage, so to speak.”

And the feeling was mutual.

“What can you say about a man who would take a group of girls, absolutely no relation to him, and father them as his own?” said Tarra Blackwell Hogan, a key contributor on Wildwood’s 1994 state runners-up. Known as Tarra Blackwell in her playing days, her playing career at Wildwood earned her a scholarship to Florida Southern College and a degree in Criminology.

“He knew our personalities and how to motivate each one of us. Make no mistake; Hamp could be tough. He could rake you up one side and down the other. But he would also turn around and show his love for you with a simple hug. We always knew he had our best interests in mind, putting us ahead of himself.“

Blackwell said Hampton quickly became more than a coach to his players.

He cooked for them.

He taxied them around town.

And — most important — he was a counselor and teacher.

“Hamp always made sure our grades were always on point,” Blackwell said. “He knew every one of our mother’s by their first name and didn’t mind calling them. Hamp taught me so many life lessons when I didn’t realize I was being taught. He will always be one of the biggest mentors in my life, and I’m confident that every girl he’s ever coach can say the same thing.

“I’m forever grateful to him and I will love him for the rest of my life.”

Kari Niblack, an All-State performer who powered the Wildcats to state championships in 2017 and 2018, echoed Blackwell’s sentiments.

Niblack is a freshman at West Virginia who was recently named the Big 12 Conference’s Sixth Man of the Year.

“He never let me be satisfied,” Niblack said. “He helped me become the player I am today by pushing me past my limits. He always pointed out what more I could do and then showed me how to get there. And he did that with every one of his girls.”

Even though he is still relatively young — he will not turn 60 for several more years — Hampton is comfortable with his decision to step down as coach and as school principal. His wife will retire, too, and the couple have already begun making plans for the future.

“Fortunately, my parents are still alive, so I’ll get to go back up to Kentucky and spend some time with them,” Hampton said. “We’re both in good health and still young enough to really enjoy our retirement and spend some quality time together. We’ve bought a house on the coast down state, so we’re not going too far away.”

Retirement will also afford Hampton the time and ability to take road trips and watch many of his former players in action. He also expects to show up on occasion in the “Woodshed” — the moniker given to the Wildwood gym — to watch the Wildcats in action.

As a fan.

“This will be the first time I’ve been able to go see my kids — my former players — play in college,” Hampton said. “It’s going to be so much fun to see Kari and Danasia (Bogle, a member of the 2018 championship team) and Jada (Perry, who played on the 2017 team) play. I’m also going to watch Ashtin (Ingram, another longtime Wildcat who signed recently with the College of Central Florida in Ocala) play a few games next season.”

Regardless of what he does or where he goes in retirement, Hampton will never forget his career at Wildwood, as a coach and educator. He walks away on his own terms, proud that didn’t overstay his welcome.

The basketball program, he feels, is in “good” shape for his successor and students have plenty of reasons to be proud of their school.

“I’ve had a great run,” Hampton said. “These girls I’ve had, who have played for me and those who were just students, they’re the pride of the whole thing. I’ve always wanted Wildwood — the school and the community — to know I’ve always had their bests interests at heart and wanted everyone to be proud of Wildwood High School and Wildwood Middle High School.

“I will always bleed Wildwood blue.”",https://www.dailycommercial.com/sports/20190317/wildwoods-hampton-has-secure-legacy-as-he-steps-down?rssfeed=true,2019-03-17T13:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
1452,Boys & Girl's Club's Youth of the Year turns barriers and bullying into opportunities,"Islande Victorin used to duck her head and hide in the back of the room during her leadership classes at the Boys & Girls Club in Immokalee.

She didn’t want to speak when she was called on; she was self-conscious about not grasping English and having an accent. She and her family moved to the United States from Haiti in 2011, when Victorin was 10 years old.

The day Victorin’s instructor, TaSheekia Perry, asked Victorin to speak in class for the first time, a friend stood up and said Victorin didn’t speak English. Perry said Victorin could speak in Creole and the friend could translate for her, but she needed to introduce herself to the class.

“Islande rolled her eyes so hard at me I thought they were gonna roll out of the sockets,” Perry said. “I think she felt I was embarrassing her in front of her peers.”

Victorin said her classmates could be cruel. As hard as she tried to learn, fellow students laughed at her for not speaking the language. When she couldn’t express herself the way she intended and tried to clarify, they laughed some more. They made fun of her height and called her a giraffe.

“It was tough, but that only pushed me to work harder,” Victorin said.

Her leadership, character building and youth development classes pushed her out of her comfort zone. As Victorin improved her language skills, she started participating more and gaining more confidence. She could stand up for herself when she was bullied, and she could stand up for others when they were being treated unfairly. She became a role model to her peers at the Boys & Girls Club Bolch Campus in Immokalee. She also tutored elementary school students through the Guadalupe Center’s Tutor Corps program.

She still struggled at times even as various mentors helped her build confidence. Victorin wanted to change her accent, but Perry told her that was a part of who she was. They would simply work on ways to project her voice and slow her speech so she could communicate the way she wanted.

“When she became confident in her voice, she became more assertive, spoke out against things hurting other people and was able to share herself in a more confident way with others,” Perry said. “I think it all started with her voice.”

(Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Now 18, Victorin’s tenacity, confidence and leadership earned her the title of Boys & Girls Club of Collier County’s 2019 Youth of the Year. She was celebrated during a ceremony in late February and moves on to the state Youth of the Year competition the weekend of April 11.

Youth of the Year is the Boys & Girls Club of America’s top recognition program and requires nominees and winners to exemplify leadership skills, service, academic excellence and healthy lifestyles.

She earned a $4,000 college scholarship from the Boys & Girls Club of Collier County for her win. A senior at Immokalee High School, Victorin plans to attend Arcadia University in Pennsylvania, about an hour north of Philadelphia. She earned a full scholarship to the private university through the Guadalupe Center tutoring program.

She has been away from her parents and two brothers for days or weeks at a time, like during one summer when she attended Brown University for three weeks and earned college credit, but going out of state for university will be a longer goodbye. Victorin plans to study psychology. She loves to work with children and may take that route wherever her career takes her.

For three of her high school years, Victorin tutored kids from kindergarten to second grade in reading, writing and math at Pinecrest Elementary in Immokalee. She also tutored new students who needed some extra help learning English as a second language.

Her role as a mentor goes hand-in-hand with a defining moment in her life: her baptism. Victorin said she decided to be baptized through her Baptist Church in Immokalee.

It was a big decision to make, she said, one that made her happy and a little scared for the future.

“You have to know what it means and what kind of a decision it is because it’s a lifelong commitment,” Victorin said. “To me it was basically deciding that I’m living and working for God and that my decisions, my actions, I have to project myself in a positive manner and not in a way that gives reasons (for people) to put me down.”

That commitment to her faith shaped the way she mentored youth.

“I’m very conscious of my actions because I know these kids are looking up to me,” Victorin said. “I’m basically a role model to them, so I have to know what I’m doing.”

She wants to succeed at everything she does and be brave in all her pursuits. She said she’s come to realize she has what it takes to take risks and be successful.

“I see Islande in a leadership role in whatever she does in her future,” said Perry, the leadership instructor.

Victorin is the pride of her mentors, peers, colleagues and family.

The little ones she has tutored throughout her high school years are especially proud.

She connected with them by sharing her experiences with them and talked to them about how she has overcome obstacles with a strong support system, according to Deanna Peterson, one of Guadalupe Center’s Tutor Corps coordinators.

She’s taught her kids that it’s OK to ask for help, be bold and take risks.

“Now all the younger students want to be just like Islande and go to college when they ‘get big,’” Peterson said.

1453,"In Golden Gate Estates, backyard shooting ranges spark debate","CLOSE Members of the public practice shooting at the Collier County Sheriff's Office's gun range, which is open every first and third Saturday of the month Alex Driehaus, Naples Daily News

In Golden Gate Estates — where residents have long been drawn to large, affordable lots and privacy away from the bustle of the urban coast — a fight over backyard shooting ranges has been brewing as local officials say a sweeping state law prevents them from regulating what some see as a growing public safety concern.

Collier County used to have a variety of local ordinances on the books that kept recreational shooting in neighborhoods in check, but a 2011 law backed by the National Rifle Association forced county officials to repeal those rules.

Though local governments had been preempted from passing ordinances regulating firearms for decades, the 2011 law threatened city and county officials who defied the state with hefty fines and even removal from office.

Since then, law enforcement officials say they have seen an increase in incidents related to makeshift shooting ranges in the sprawling subdivision with stray bullets damaging property and, in a couple of cases, injuring neighbors.

Deputies want residents to exercise their rights safely, but because the state statute doesn’t spell out what residents have to do to shoot recreationally on their property, as long as it’s “reasonably safe,” law enforcement officials are left with few options, said Lt. Gary Martin, the Collier County’s Sheriff’s Office’s Golden Gates Estates commander.

And the definition of safe can be subjective, Martin said.

“We had a guy, I believe it was last year, that was shooting a rifle through a mattress. He thought it was safe,” he said. “We’ve had people shooting into buckets. We’ve had people shooting into piles of mulch.”

For deputies, Martin said, the issue becomes a public safety concern when other people’s property is damaged or people feel their life is in danger because of their neighbor’s shooting habits.

A Golden Gate Estates man who deputies say struck a neighbor in her residence while he was firing a handgun in his backyard for target practice was arrested in late December. Days later, the polarizing issue sparked dueling petitions online and heated discussions on social media.

An online petition from a Golden Gate Estates resident calling for stricter rules to regulate so-called backyard shooting ranges on one-acre properties has garnered more than 1,000 signatures since Jan. 3.

“People feel like it sounds like a war zone sometimes,” said George Guyer, who started the petition, referring to those who have commented online. The police officer and longtime Golden Gate Estates resident is worried about the well-being of his teenage daughter and others.

“It’s not about the Second Amendment,” said Guyer, 47. “I just want people to be safe.”

Opponents to an outright ban fired off their own salvo of petitions soon after Guyer started his.

One advocates to keep the existing rules, but change berm and distance requirements instead, and enforce stricter punishments for those who violate laws.

“Keep the law for shooting, for those of us that abide by the rules and know what we are doing,” the petition states. It was started by Golden Gate Estates resident Brandon Garcia and has garnered more than 200 signatures since Jan. 7.

Garcia, a sergeant in the Florida Army National Guard who has a berm in his own backyard and regularly shoots there, said he understands other residents’ concerns.

He said he wanted to look for a “middle ground” approach that would satisfy both sides. A starting point could be requiring berms to be at least 6 feet high, said Garcia, 37.

Another petition, created on Jan. 6 by Dan Huffman, asks County Commissioner Bill McDaniel, whose district includes Golden Gate Estates, to support backyard shooting ranges.

“Many moved out to the Golden Gate Estates for the freedom of open spaces and against the restrictions of the rest of Collier County!” the online petition states.

“This is a rural area so don't let the knee jerk reactions of those who do not understand this impose restrictions on those who want to continue using the Estates and not have unnecessary restrictions placed on it! This includes responsible people and their use of THEIR property for backyard ranges!”

More than 350 people have signed that petition, which has since been closed. Efforts to reach Huffman were unsuccessful, but in an update on the petition website he asks supporters to get the word out “before there is one more thing lost” to the Estates area.

McDaniel has heard his constituents' concerns. But there’s likely not much the county can do about it.

“It’s a statutorily preempted process,” McDaniel said in an interview earlier this year. “We’re not allowed to meddle with the backyard shooting.”

Incidents increased in 2018

Martin, with CCSO, said deputies patrolling the Golden Gate Estates district have seen an uptick in incidents related to backyard shooting ranges since the county had to roll back its local ordinances.

The Golden Gate Estates substation began to informally keep track of backyard shooting range incidents in 2017, said Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Michelle Batten.

In 2017, there were eight incidents in Golden Gate Estates. The following year that number climbed to 15. (Because the numbers are based on an informal tally, the actual number of incidents could be higher, Batten said.)

When deputies get a call about somebody’s property being struck, they try to track down the shooter based on the trajectory or the noise, if the firing is still occurring, Martin said.

“In a lot of cases, they’re very apologetic, they can’t believe that what they were doing caused damage to somebody else’s property,” Martin said. “And oftentimes the neighbors in some way, work it out themselves.”

Even ranges that appear to be set up safely at first glance can be problematic.

Deputies have encountered instances where residents have “range quality” berms, but then place targets that stick out above the berm, Martin said. One resident had a 6-foot-tall dirt berm, but the upper part of the target, “what would’ve been the head and shoulders,” reached over the top of the berm, he recalled.

“So when he was shooting at them, he was actually shooting over the berm,” Martin said.

And at times there are consequences more serious than damaged property.

The 21-year-old woman who was struck in December told deputies she was sitting at her dinner table next to a window when she heard a crash and felt something strike her right arm and side. She suffered a laceration to her arm and broken skin and bruising to her right side, and was treated at a hospital, according to a Sheriff’s Office report.

In 2016, a 14-year-old girl was injured when a man who was shooting at a small berm in a backyard in Golden Gate Estates accidentally struck a neighbor’s home. The girl’s family told the Daily News at the time that if the bullet hadn’t hit her left hand, breaking a couple of bones, it could have hit her mother's face, neck or shoulder.

“The lots are real narrow and real long, so your neighbors could be close depending on what direction you’re shooting,” Martin said.

When people ask him about backyard shooting ranges, Martin said he recommends they consider their civil liability if an accident happens and to “very objectively” inspect their target “from all angles.”

“Walk around to the other side and if you believe that it’s safe to shoot at it from the opposite side where your loved ones and your house and your property’s at, then perhaps it’s safe enough for you to shoot at from the side that you’re considering,” he said.

‘Education, not regulation'

For their part, county officials say their hands are tied. And with the threat of sanctions hanging over their heads if they were to regulate the issue, some have been reluctant to even discuss the matter.

When McDaniel proposed to bring an agenda item forward to discuss some ideas, Klatzkow, the county attorney, advised against it.

“I think it's a terrible idea. I'm sorry,” he told commissioners at the Jan. 22 meeting. “...They could remove you from the dais. Now, I've never seen a preemption statute quite like that in my life.”

Instead, McDaniel said he wants to reach out to the sheriff and “see if we can develop a set of recommendations from an educational perspective just to enhance the health, safety and welfare of those facilities.”

Having a town hall meeting on the issue and increasing hours of operation at a Sheriff’s Office-run public gun range off Oil Well Grade Road have also been discussed, although the latter could be complicated by potential development that is planned in the area, McDaniel said.

The Sheriff’s Office gun range is currently open to the public from 8 a.m. to noon the first and third Saturday of each month, according to the Sheriff’s Office website. It allows only pistols and handguns.

“Education, not regulation, is the premise of what we're, in fact, talking about,” he said.

But some think even that could backfire.

“I would also caution that when you start to educate the public about the restrictions, you're also going to be educating a lot of people that might want to have backyard shooting ranges,” said Commissioner Burt Saunders during the January meeting. “They're going to find out that they're legal.”

‘A split issue’

When Guyer, whose petition sparked spirited debates on social media, first moved to Golden Gate Estates 15 years ago there were rules in place that prohibited the practice. He said he thinks it should be that way again.

“I want something done about it,” he said. “There’s just too much risk on a one-acre property.”

Guyer said he would like to see the density requirements changed from one acre or more to 2 ½ or 5 acres. He also proposes a permitting and inspection process to make sure the shooting is done safely.

“It’s clearly a safety issue,” he said. “And it’s a quality of life issue.”

Guyer knows that change will likely have to happen on a state level. He sent state Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Naples, and state Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, an email about the issue.

“Basically I just got the run-around,” he said.

Usually a tragedy sparks change, Guyer said. “I’m trying to prevent that before it happens,” he said.

For Garcia, the Golden Gate Estates resident who started a petition seeking a happy medium solution, being able to shoot on his property is one of the reasons he moved to the rural subdivision.

He said he shoots “probably once a month,” sometimes twice. At times, his friends come to join him.

Shooting at commercial ranges can get “pretty pricey” and many who shoot don’t want to drive that far, Garcia said.

Still, he understands others’ concerns.

“What if a round hits my son?” Garcia said. “How would I feel then?”

He said it’s the ones who don’t know how to be safe with guns that ruin it for others.

“Most gun owners, they take safety pretty seriously,” Garcia said.

Martin, the Sheriff’s Office lieutenant, said the topic of backyard shooting ranges is “kind of a split issue.”

“People want to be able to go out in the backyard and shoot,” he said. “They just have to be safe when they’re doing (it). They have to consider that the Estates is still populated.”

1455,Belle Glade boy injured after getting attacked by pit bull,"Belle Glade injured after getting attacked by pit bull (WPEC)

A boy was hospitalized Thursday after he was attacked by a pit bull.

It happened moments after he got off the school bus at the mobile home park where he lives.

The attack was caught on surveillance video.

The boy, who neighbors say is 10 years old, was attacked in the road near the entrance of Lake Breeze Mobile Home Park at NW 18th Street and Lake Circle.

The boy was bitten repeatedly in the leg and face.

“It was horrible watching the little boy like that,” neighbor Miriam Mojica said.

Surveillance video from a nearby mobile home shows the pit bull attacking a boy.

The dog lunged at the boy, biting his leg as the frantic boy tries to get away.

Neighbors say the victim is a fifth grader at Belle Glade Elementary.

Video shows him getting off the school bus a little before 3 p.m. when the attack happened.

“The dog went behind him and attacked him from his leg first, that’s when he dropped to the floor, that’s whenever he went to his face, like bit him in his face,” Mojica said.

The victim’s cousin demonstrated how he used a broomstick to hit the dog---using every bit of energy he had---to get the animal off the boy.

“I hit it as hard as I could and that’s when it let go,” he said as he showed CBS12 News how he swung the broomstick like a baseball bat.

The video shows the boy tries to run behind a fence, but the dog follows.

Then, he runs behind a car, but the dog still doesn't give up.

“When I was looking out the window, I saw the pit bull attacking him,” fourth grader Adamaris Medina said.

A girl says she was on the school bus and heard the boy's cries for help.

“I was also crying for him ‘cause he was like yelling help,” Medina said.

One little boy says he threw rocks at the pit bull to try to stop it from attacking the victim.

“I thought it was gonna come after me,” six-year-old Brandon Medina said.

Finally, adults nearby show up and pick the child up and put him in the car. They say the boy is recovering at a hospital with non life-threatening injuries.

When deputies arrived, they say the dog lunged at them, so to protect themselves and others, they shot and killed the pit bull.

Neighbors believe someone dropped the pit bull off in the neighborhood Thursday morning.

They feel the owner no longer wanted the dog, which allowed this tragedy to happen.

A spokesperson with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office says the victim will need plastic surgery.",http://cbs12.com/news/local/belle-glade-injured-after-getting-attacked-by-pit-bull,2019-03-15T02:19:24Z,WPEC,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407
1456,ECSO: Pensacola man instructed teen to sic dog on deputies,"CLOSE Two Escambia County Sheriff's Office deputies were attacked by a dog while attempting to make an arrest in the Bellview area on Wednesday, and the dog was shot and killed. Pensacola News Journal

An arrest report for the man accused of instructing a teenager to release a dog to attack deputies on Wednesday sheds new light on the events that led up to the attack, which ended with a deputy shooting and killing the animal.

The dog reportedly bit two Escambia County Sheriff's Office deputies on their calves during a scuffle at a mobile home in the 2100 block of Deerwood Road and then attempted to bite them later outside of the home.

That led a third deputy to shoot and kill the dog, a 4-year-old named Rosco.

An ECSO spokesman told the News Journal on Wednesday that both deputies received medical attention for their injuries and were released.

Cairo Jones, 34, and a 15-year-old who live in the home were both arrested early Wednesday afternoon and are accused of siccing the dog on deputies as they were trying to arrest Jones on marijuana charges.

ECSO deputies arrived at the mobile home on Deerwood Road around 10:30 a.m. Wednesday after an anonymous caller reported an argument in front of the home had been going on since 7 a.m., according to Jones' arrest report.

Deputies said when they made contact with Jones, he would not provide deputies with his name or any information on the incident, then threatened to sic his dog on them.

Jones then jumped up and down on a backyard trampoline while recording a deputy on his phone, and when he jumped off the trampoline, a marijuana baggie allegedly fell out of his pocket, the report states.

Deputies tried to take Jones into custody a few minutes later, but he allegedly knocked their hands out of the way. A scuffle spilled into the home, and deputies unsuccessfully attempted to use a Taser on Jones.

As the scuffle continued, Jones allegedly yelled for the 15-year-old to let the dog loose on deputies. The teen obliged and brought the dog through the front door as the two deputies were on the ground attempting to arrest Jones, according to the report.

Deputies were able to handcuff Jones, despite the dog biting them both. Deputies added in the report that the teen also resisted arrest, but they detained her after a short struggle.

A third deputy said that as the other two deputies exited the home with the suspects, the dog ran up to one of them and ""barked viciously,"" then turned and tried to bite the third deputy. He said he then pulled out his gun and shot the dog twice, the second time as a way of ""taking it out of its misery.""

Macey Hardenbrook, Jones' live-in girlfriend and mother of the 15-year-old, told the News Journal at the scene on Wednesday that she saw her daughter in a patrol car shortly after the incident and saw the girl had bruises on her face.

Hardenbrook, who was not home at the time of the altercation, said her daughter was hurt during the scuffle.

""My daughter's face was bruised,"" she said. ""They swung her onto the ground.""

Hardenbrook also said her dog was very possessive of her children when she was not home.

""That was a $2,000 dog, he had done training to be a guard dog,"" she said.

She also admitted that her dog had bitten people in the past.

""If you come into my yard and I'm not home, he'll bite,"" she said.

Jones is charged with aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, battery, resisting arrest and marijuana possession. As of Thursday afternoon, he was still in jail on $42,000 bond.

The State Attorney's Office said the 15-year-old faces a felony charge of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and will be tried as a minor.

1460,"Netflix, ‘Longmire’ star Bailey Chase talks about growing up in Naples, acting career","Naples native Bailey Chase co-stars with Spencer Locke in a new Netflix Original movie, ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" (Photo: Photo courtesy of Greg Peters)

Bailey Chase for years has played the character that viewers often dislike.

The Naples native and father of three says he's enjoying his new roles, including the new Netflix Original movie ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" that premiered earlier this month.

Chase, 46, gained prominence for his acting from 2012 to 2017 on the Western crime series ""Longmire,"" in which he played the role of an ambitious Wyoming sheriff's deputy, Branch Connally.

“More than anything, the arc that I got to do on 'Longmire,' that character Branch, he hit all the notes,"" Chase said in a recent telephone interview.

""It gave me a confidence as an actor that I could do anything, I could play good. I could play bad. And by portraying these newer characters, that’s how I connect with the audience more. Then they start rooting for you.”

In his latest role, based on a true story, Chase plays Cory Snyder, the father of Amberley Snyder, a successful rodeo barrel racer who returns to the sport after a car crash.

In real life, Bailey and his wife, Amy, have three children: twin 2-year-olds (a boy and a girl) and a 4-year-old daughter who was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Chase was still shooting ""Longmire.""

“For me as a dad, to play that role, as an actor, you go to those places where I’m imagining my girl in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair,"" Bailey said.

“Since 'Longmire' and becoming a dad, I feel like I can play anything.”

Happy Mother’s Day to all the amazing Mama’s out there (miss you Mom) and to my beautiful wife for these 3 little backseat drivers ❤️🚌 pic.twitter.com/dln0pQr4cT — Bailey Chase (@Bailey_Chase) May 13, 2018

Born in Chicago, he grew up in Naples, living in the seaside town from age 4 through his freshman year at Naples High School. He transferred to the Bolles School in Jacksonville, where he played football and baseball and graduated from the private school before heading to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

After graduating from Duke with a bachelor's degree in sports psychology, Chase said, he decided to fulfill ""a boyhood dream"" and headed to Los Angeles instead of New York.

""I came out here, being a Florida boy,"" Chase said. ""The climate was a little bit better. I was living at the beach, waiting tables and going to acting class.”

He eventually traveled overseas to become a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, to study Shakespeare.

When he returned to the U.S., he landed a role on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" a television series that ran from 1997 to 2003. For the next few years, Chase portrayed Chris Robert Hughes on the soap opera ""As The World Turns.""

He co-starred as ""Becks"" Scott in the ABC comedy-drama ""Ugly Betty,"" which ran from 2006 to 2010, and on the TNT series ""Saving Grace"" that ran between 2007 and 2010.

But his most notable role came in 2012, on ""Longmire,"" which began on the A&E channel and, later, Netflix. Robert Taylor starred as Walt Longmire, a stoic, rugged, no-nonsense sheriff; the actor revealed his Australian accent away from the camera, Chase said.

""He’s a good dude,"" Chase said of Taylor. ""It was a strong cast. We were all distinctly different.”

Longmire"" also co-starred Katee Sackhoff, Lou Diamond Phillips and Gerald McRaney, known for his TV roles on ""Major Dad"" and ""Simon & Simon"" that Chase said he grew up watching.

Upcoming work for Chase includes a role this summer on season 4 of ""Queen of the South,"" a crime drama on the USA Network. Chase said he's been flying to New Orleans for filming and returning home to LA every weekend.

All he said he could reveal about his character is that he's ""a jazz musician with a dark past.""

Chase said he still has family in Florida, including a brother who's a builder based in Ocala. He hasn't been in Naples for more than a decade but hopes to visit again one day.

“Growing up down there, I couldn’t wait to get out,"" he said of Naples.

""But once I got into my 20s and my 30s, I always enjoyed coming back home. Naples will always be home. It's so humid; it just has a feel and a smell. It’s very nostalgic for me.”

1461,Man suspected of abducting 2-year-old charged in mother's shooting death,"- A Wisconsin man -- with ties to Florida -- who is centered in an Amber Alert will face a murder charge in the death of his child’s mother, police said.

The Amber Alert for two-year-old Noelani Robinson was issued Monday afternoon, according to FOX 32. At the time, officials in Milwaukee, Wisconsin said the suspect, Dariaz Higgins, and father of Noelani, did not return the child to her mother, and is suspected of abducting the little girl.

Noelani’s mother, 24-year-old Sierra Robinson, was found fatally shot shortly after 1 p.m. Monday near 91st Street and W. Mill Road, according to FOX 6. The news outlet reports that the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office has charged Higgins in the deadly shooting, which also injured 28-year-old woman, who was taken to the hospital.

Higgins is believed to be armed and dangerous. If you see him, officials ask that you call 911 immediately. The father and daughter were last seen driving a 2014 black Cadillac with the Florida license plate, HVCZ95.

Sierra’s mother, Latosha Bryant, spoke to FOX 6 and said her daughter was living in Las Vegas, but flew to Milwaukee over the weekend to pick up Noelani, who was staying with Higgins. Bryant said she isn’t sure why Higgins took Noelani, or where they may have gone.

Here on the Space Coast we’ll soon be launching some incredible female astronauts for the first time since 2011. But before commercial spaceflight with astronauts happens later this year, learn about the fearless female space explorers.

There is a reason NASA has embraced the term crewed instead of manned when talking about human spaceflight, because since 2013 the space agency has had equal parts female and male astronaut classes.

There are more inspiring women than can fit into one article but let's meet a few, shall we?

A Virgin Galactic test pilot

Kelly Latimer is a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force and now is a test pilot for Virgin Galactic. Latimer has logged more than 6,200 hours flying 40 different aircraft, including NASA's space shuttle carrier aircraft and the agency's airborne observatory, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, known as SOFIA.

With Virgin Galactic, Latimer will fly SpaceShipTwo -- and later this year she may be responsible for piloting the space plane with the first paying astronauts on board.



“I always had this passion to be an astronaut, just from as long as I can remember that’s what I’ve wanted to do,” Latimer said.



Watch the video below to hear why Latimer became a test pilot.

Russia’s only current woman cosmonaut

Russia flew the first two women in space, starting with Valentina Tereshkova in 1963. While Russia launched a woman into space years before the U.S. space program, only two women have flown for Roscosmos since 1984. The Russian space agency currently only has one female cosmonaut: Anna Kikina.

She is currently training in Star City, Russia, with other cosmonauts and astronauts but does not have a spaceflight planned right now. NASA astronaut Christina Koch recently bumped into Kikina during their training.

I’m not usually the type to fan girl. But when you bump into the one current woman cosmonaut and you’re both training in the same building, it’s hard not to. She was learning manual Soyuz docking and I was co-pilot training. Honored to share the same uniform as you, Анна Кикина! pic.twitter.com/ZhQ1ChZSVC — Christina H Koch (@Astro_Christina) October 19, 2018

Laura Seward Forczyk, the owner of Astralytical, a space consulting firm, told Ars Technica last September the current Russian culture isn’t supportive of women in “high-powered careers.”



Here’s hoping Kikina inspires more girls and women in Russia to apply for the next cosmonaut class, which is open to people over 35 years old with specific degrees in STEM fields.

The first African-American woman to fly in space

In 1961, Alan Shepard was the first American to launch into space on Freedom 7. It would take more than three decades before an African American woman would visit space. That incredible human was Dr. Mae Jemison.

Jemison became the first black woman to visit the International Space Station in 1992. Now 62, she has continued to inspire people of color to pursue careers in science, technology, engineers and math fields with her company the Jemison Group.

Friday’s Google Doodle for International Women's Day includes a quote from Jemison, “Never be limited by other people’s limited imaginations.” According to Space.com the quote comes from Jemison's 2009 speech at the Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students.

NASA's first female astronauts to fly on Boeing's CST-Starliner

This year NASA’s commercial crew spacecraft by SpaceX and Boeing are set to launch U.S. astronauts from Cape Canaveral for the first time since 2011.



NASA announced the first nine astronauts to fly on Boeing’s CST-100 and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon last August, including veteran astronaut Suni Williams and NASA astronaut Nicole Aunapu Mann.

Williams has made two trips to the International Space Station totaling 322 days flying on both the Space Shuttle and Russian Soyuz spacecraft.

When others said you couldn't, you said ""We can do it!"" 💪

To the pioneers of space, our #Starliner teammates and @Commercial_Crew astronauts @AstroDuke and @Astro_Suni, thank you for building the future and daring to explore. #InternationalWomensDay#BalanceForBetterpic.twitter.com/PoCMim9GJJ — Boeing Space (@BoeingSpace) March 8, 2019

With more than 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft, Williams served in the U.S. Navy flying helicopters on relief and combat missions. Later, she became a test pilot and instructor. Williams was deployed when she was selected to be a NASA astronaut in 1998.

Williams told News 6 last August the gender of an astronaut or pilot shouldn't matter.

""When I was a helicopter pilot, when I did my first spacewalk, when I was living on the space station ... the helicopter doesn't know if I'm a girl or a boy,"" Williams said. ""The space station doesn't know, the spacesuit doesn't know. So why should it really matter, right?""

More: SpaceX Crew Dragon splashes down in Atlantic Ocean to complete successful test flight

The first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner will be Mann's first trip to space. If an uncrewed flight slated for no earlier than April goes well that launch will happen in late summer.



Mann earned the nickname “Duke” as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps. She served on combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and as a test pilot for the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet. Mann was selected as part of the 2013 NASA astronaut class -- the first class to be equal parts men and women.

She told News 6 last August after her assignment on the Boeing Starliner she hopes the return to human spaceflight in the U.S. will empower the next generation of space explorers.

Canadian Space Agency flight controller Kristen Facciol announced on Twitter March 1 she will be on console while McClain and Koch conduct the first all-female spacewalk.

As a young girl, @Astro_Christina dreamed of going to space. Next week, that dream becomes a reality when she launches to the @Space_Station!

Then, they say Rivera pulled a knife on hospital workers before being arrested.

ORLANDO — A woman accused of stabbing her daughter to death told investigators she killed the 11-year-old to keep her from having sex, authorities in Florida said.

Rose Alcides Rivera, 28, pulled up to a hospital in Orlando asking for help for her daughter on Sunday morning, but the girl was already dead from multiple stab wounds, sheriff's investigators said. Then, they say Rivera pulled a knife on hospital workers before being arrested.

She later told investigators she killed her daughter to ""prevent her from having sex"" with men, authorities said. She is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Aleyda Rivera.

The mother told first responders ""my baby is gone,"" the Orlando Sentinel reported. The child had 15 stab wounds to her back and a defensive wound on her right arm.

Orange County Sheriff's investigators said the incident started early Sunday when the mother took her daughter to the home of a man and accused him of having sex with the child. Witnesses told detectives the child denied having sex with anyone.

An arrest report said Rivera first denied stabbing the girl but eventually admitted to killing her. ""Rivera stated she stabbed her daughter while in the car, and while stabbing her she was attempting to make her more comfortable,"" an investigator wrote in the report.

The mother told detectives she believes her daughter is in heaven.

According to the report, Rivera said she didn't see her daughter having sex with the man, nor did the girl tell her she was having sex.

Rivera had a superficial cut on her arm, which authorities believe was self-inflicted.

1469,Former Space Coast home delivery business owner appears on 'Shark Tank' to pitch Moink,"CLOSE See how Alyssa and Zach Brown, an ER nurse and firefighter, won over the ""Shark Tank"" sharks with the Moki Door Step and walked out as millionaires. USA TODAY

Will the sharks take a bite out of meat?

Lucinda Cramsey, founder of Moink, or moinkbox.com, sure hopes so. She pitched her custom meats-to-home delivery service to Mark Cuban, Jamie Siminoff, Kevin O'Leary, Lori Greiner, and Daymond John on ""Shark Tank.""

The episode airs at 10 p.m. Sunday, March 10, on ABC.

Cramsey also founded spacegirlorganics.com when she briefly lived in Melbourne. Space Girl delivers fresh organic produce to the Space Coast and parts of Orlando, while Moink ships products nationwide. After 30 days here, she moved ""back home"" to Missouri and temporarily ran Space Girl from afar before turning the reins over to a friend. She started other home-delivery businesses, but Moink, by far, is the most successful.

""Florida is near and dear to my heart and part of the story of how I got to where I got,"" Cramsey said by phone. ""The week I started doing deliveries in Florida was the week that I met my future husband. Even though we met on the East Coast, we grew up 45 minutes from each other. It just so happens that 'Shark Tank' will air eight years to the day from the time I started Space Girl.""

During her short stay in Melbourne, she was a single mom to Fiona, who's now 12 years old. ""I moved halfway across the country with $5,000 and a baby on my hip,"" Cramsey recalled.

The story comes up in the episode.

""Being in the 'Shark Tank' is an extremely nerve-wracking situation. I was sweating in places that I didn't know I could sweat!"" Cramsey joked. She described the experience as business boot camp. ""You should know your numbers, but nothing can prepare you for this surreal environment. They don't know anything about you when you walk in. It's not like a first date. Exactly what you see on TV really is real.""

To celebrate the episode, Cramsey, who lives in La Belle, Missouri, with her husband, Adam, daughter Fiona and son Henry, plans to watch it with ""the whole town.""

""I literally live in a town of 600 people. To me, Melbourne is a big city,"" she said.

""Our entire small town will meet up at the only place we can meet, which is the bar. We are having a good ole fashioned carry-in"" (since the Cramseys don't have a TV or cable or high-speed internet).

Said Cramsey: ""I'm excited to see how it turns out.""

Authorities said she may be with one or both of her parents, Elliot Singleton, 26, and Chloe Wall, 18. Anyone with information on Skylah's whereabouts should call 911.…

DELTONA, Fla. - A 4-month-old girl reported missing Saturday morning in Volusia County was found in Orlando after her parents fled the area to avoid a judge's order to surrender the baby, Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told clickorlando.com

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement issued a missing child alert for Skylah Singleton. She was last seen in the area of the 2900 block of Snow Drive in Deltona.

Chitwood was holding a news conference on the missing infant when deputies informed him Skylah had been found in Orlando.

The sheriff said Skylah will likely be taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center for evaluation. When she was born the sheriff said she had heroin in her system.

Authorities said the baby was likely with her parents, Elliot Singleton, 26, and Chloe Wall, 18. Both parents were found in Orlando and arrested, Chitwood said.

Sheriff's Office officials said in a news release both parents were released from jail earlier this week and they left the area to avoid a judge's order to surrender their baby to the state.

Detectives said Wall's mother may have driven her daughter and the baby to Orlando and bought them supplies to go out of state.

Volusia County authorities got a tip that the baby was at a home in Orlando and worked with Orange County law enforcement to place the address under surveillance. Just before 3 p.m., the girl was found, according to the sheriff.

Chitwood said anyone who was harboring Wall and Singleton may also face charges.

Edgewater police arrested Wall on drug possession charges Tuesday. Singleton was also arrested on charges of resisting without violence.

""At the time of the arrests, Skylah was in the vehicle with her parents, where police found prescription pills and paraphernalia used to smoke crack cocaine,"" Volusia County Sheriff's Office public information officer Andrew Grant said. ""Wall is believed to have a history of drug abuse. Skylah tested positive for the presence of drugs in her system immediately after she was born.""

Deputies said after the parents' arrests, the Florida Department of Children and Families determined Skylah should be taken into state custody for her own safety. The family did not cooperate with DCF, and when Wall and Singleton were released later Tuesday, they left the area with the girl, according to the news release.

Wall's mother, Jennifer Wall, 41, was arrested Saturday morning in Deltona. Deputies said she provided false information during the missing child investigation to conceal the baby's location and defy the court order.

""Grandma is a piece of human garbage,"" Chitwood said of Jennifer Wall for helping her daughter avoid surrendering the baby.

Chitwood said the judge's order was for temporary removal of the infant ""to get the child the care that the child needs and isn't getting.""

1477,First black woman in space speaks to FSC,"LAKELAND — She played with Barbie Dolls and chemistry sets as a child. And she loved the stars.

NASA astronaut, engineer, entrepreneur, physician and educator Dr. Mae C. Jemison, the first black woman in space, was the featured speaker Friday morning at Florida Southern College's 136th-Year Founders Day Convocation and was named the college's 85th honorary chancellor.

""I was this little girl who assumed she would go into space,"" Jemison said.

""And I made it,"" she said, noting that the opportunity came with the help of others.

Jemison, 62, served six years as a NASA astronaut and was the first woman of color to go into space. eAdmitted to NASA's astronaut training program on June 4, 1987, she joined six other astronauts on the space shuttle Endeavour on Sept. 12, 1992. She also has been on television many times, including a guest appearance in an episode of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation.""

""Dr. Mae Jemison has found numerous ways to demonstrate how technologic advancements can benefit our society, while inspiring others to pursue their own dreams of improving the world,"" said FSC President Anne Kerr.

She also is a medical doctor and served as the area Peace Corps medical officer for Sierra Leone and Liberia. A professor at Dartmouth College, she focused on technology designs for sustainability for industrialized and developing nations, according to her bio.

""We look at science to solve so many problems,"" she told those in attendance at the Branscomb Auditorium on the FSC campus.

A child who grew up in the 1960s, she remembers being afraid for her dad on the day Martin Luther King Jr. was shot.

Many changes were taking place in the world at the time, she said. Civil rights, women's liberation, space exploration, science advances.

""All these new things were happening, and I wanted to be a part of it,"" she said.

She spoke about empowerment and what it means.

""It involves belief,"" she said, ""belief in the right to be involved, belief that you have something to contribute, belief that you can risk making the contribution.""

Quoting Mzee Julius Nyerere, she said, ""While they were trying to reach the moon, we were trying to reach the village.''

''We were able to reach the village because of space exploration.""

A firm believer in ""connections"" and ""inclusiveness across disciplines,"" she said that when she was considering what to do with her life, she found she had so many options. Her fascination with science was evident as early as kindergarten, she told The Ledger after the convocation.

""I loved space, stars and dinosaurs,"" she said, and yet she also enjoyed dancing. To be a dancer, or a doctor, she said, ""Those are the points when you have to make a decision where are are going to make your main focus.""

Pulling from her many experiences has fueled her academic and space interests.

Jemison leads 100 Year Starship, a global initiative that is funded through a competitive grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to ensure the capabilities for human travel to another star within the next 100 years. She also founded The Jemison Group Inc., a technology consulting firm that mixes critical socio-cultural issues into the design of engineering and science projects. This includes things like satellite technology for delivering health care and implementing solar dish Stirling engine electricity in developing countries. Her group researches and develops science and technology companies, such as BioSentient Corp., a medical device and services company.

What was the motivation for Jemison to chase her dreams and ambitions all the way to space and back?

""I have as much right to be in this universe as any speck of stardust,"" she told The Ledger.

1478,"Jim White brings new album, 'Waffles, Triangles & Jesus,' to Sopchoppy | Music roundup","Sometimes when I’m feeling oppressed and downtrodden, I mentally cue up a song from my favorite Jim White album, 2001’s “No Such Place.”

If I’m feeling particularly bleak, it’s usually “Handcuffed to a Fence in Mississippi.” That song never fails to cheer me up because, hey, things could be worse and at least I’m not handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi watching my significant other drive off in my prized Trans Am, and also because it is an awfully jaunty tune (with juicy, chirpy production by Morcheeba) despite the subject matter, with the hopeful refrain “things is always better than they seem.”

But my all-time favorite go-to in times of woe and stress is “10 Miles to Go on a 9 Mile Road.” It’s the most oddly optimistic song about slogging along the pitted, rocky road of life towards the dimly glow at the end of the tunnel.

After a burbling sitar intro bleeds into a fuzzed-out guitar riff, White sing-speaks the song’s main mantra:

“Girl, I got ten miles to go on a nine mile road

It's a rocky rough road, but I don't care

For life's nothing if not a blind rambling prayer

You keep your head held high, walkin' and talkin’

’Til the power of love deliver you there.”

The bridge is ornamented with daffy blips and bloops, the aforementioned guitar fuzz and a percolating little finger-picked riff, and the song goes out on a loop of “the power of love . . . the power of love.”

My spirits are elevated just thinking about it.

The singer-songwriter Jim White will bring his off-kilter wit and musical acumen when he delivers his latest deliriously uncategorizable album to From the Heart Recording Studio in Sopchoppy Saturday. (Photo: jimwhite.net)

White, a North Florida homeslice who grew up in Pensacola, travels through these parts fairly frequently. Which is a good thing, because the quirky charisma of his recordings is magnified to the nth power in person. You can surf the wave for weeks after seeing White perform, as he will this weekend.

The self-dubbed “enigmatic Southern Gothic anatomist” is returning to deliver his latest deliriously uncategorizable album, the enigmatically titled “Waffles, Triangles & Jesus,” at an intimate concert at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at From The Heart Recording Studio, 55 Rose St. in Sopchoppy.

“The new record is all over the map, it’s quite a crazy quilt,” White told former Democrat columnist (and good friend) Mark Hinson back in 2017. “Nothing goes together. . . I’m just going to make songs that I always liked and wanted to do.”

White joked to Hinson that the songs on “Waffles” belong on “the soundtrack for the end of the world.”

“We needed a psychotic soundtrack for the launching ramp off into oblivion,” White laughed. “These are very strange songs. I’m going to have to do a lot of talking between songs. There’s no way I can play these songs back to back without people getting a hernia. Bring your mental hernia belt with you.”

Sounds about par for the course for a Jim White show. Come on down to Sopchoppy and see for yourself. Tickets are $20; reservations are strongly recommended. Call 850-559-9038 or email fromtheheartrecordingstudio@gmail.com to reserve a seat.

1481,Jazz singer: Naples chanteuse finds her future in past music,"CLOSE Cobby Brzeski, a recent graduate of The Berklee College of Music in Boston, performs her song ""Be Mine"" on March 14, 2019, in the Naples Daily News studios. Alex Driehaus, Naples Daily News

After the turn of that tassel on the college mortarboard, most of us are headed for a job, 401(k)s, organizational structure and an apartment.

Cobby Brzeski is headed for a nightclub tour of the West Coast.

Brzeski, a Naples native, has already begun here, peppering dining spots and bistros around her hometown with emails and samples of her silky vocal-flute combination. She has stepped up her jazz-tinged songwriting in hopes of some commercial contracts. But a life onstage begins with getting onstage.

The Naples High graduate and Berklee College of Music alumna, is determined to write and perform, and anyone who hears her won't question her decision. Despite winning concerto competitions and Bach festivals, the petite, blonde 25-year-old has a heart full of repertoire from the swing era, the smooth sounds of Billie Holiday, the Andrews Sisters and Helen Forrest.

""A vintage girl in a contemporary world,"" says her publicity.

""Be Mine,"" her upbeat signature tune, could have been sung by her idols, and it has a way of sneaking into your head for an all-day stay: ""I always ask her to sing that one. It's my favorite,"" declared her mother, Teryl Brzeski.

""This is my dream job,"" her daughter explained. ""I love performing. I love writing songs. I aspire to positively affect the world with my music and just spread joy.""

Cobby Brzeski is working her way up the California coast, from San Diego to Pismo Beach. But first she plays four dates in the Naples area (see information box).

She already has recorded her first disc, ""Bring On the Swing."" It's an extended-play blend of her own tunes and bedrock standards such as ""Misty"" and ""The Nearness of You,"" backed by some like-minded Berklee friends. Its buttery sound is about to be applied to a second disc, ""All of Me,"" which she records in Boston in late March. With a few stops to sing in Boston night spots, of course.

Plan to hear the kind of free-flight scatting perfected by her role model, Ella Fitzgerald, along with Brzeski's jazz flute and vocals. Don't miss her instrumental riffs, from the Herbie Mann school of upbeat, breezy flute work. They're what brought her to the music world.

""A singer tends to put a face to jazz,"" she explained. ""I found the combination of being a flautist and a vocalist is something interesting to people. It's like 'Oh wow! You sing AND you play the flute!' People like the combination of instrument and vocal.""

Its underpinnings actually come from violin lessons. Brzeski studied it from age 5 to 15, and calls her experience a great foundation for jazz.

""I started out playing the Suzuki method, playing everything by ear, and that was one of the most valuable parts of my musical training,"" she said.

Brzeski is an advocate for school music; she credits the Collier County school music programs with finding the instrument she loves.

""When I went into middle school band, I got a chance to try out all kinds of instruments,"" she said. The flute caught her eye. ""I thought, hey, this is s cool instrument — and it was the only one I could make a sound on,"" she conceded, laughing.

Infatuation turned to devotion: Brzeski played in the high school marching and concert bands, and joined the Naples High jazz band, but not as a flautist.

""They didn't have parts written for flute. So I had to pick a different instrument,"" she recalled. ""So I decided to play trumpet."" She largely taught herself, she said. (For the record, she can also play drums and guitar.)

In high school Brzeski won the concerto competition of the Naples Music Club and the outstanding musician award of the Bach Ensemble competition. But she wasn't receiving the jazz education she longed for.

""I grew up with completely classical background. Classical violin, classical flute. I didn't really know how to play jazz except for what was written on the page,"" she said. So when she graduated, Brzeski's first dream wasn't college but the Interlochen Academy's post-graduate program.

It only took a vocal class and a course in improvisation with its jazz studies director, Bill Sears, to convince her that solo performance was the life she wanted .

She doesn't only enjoy golden-era standards jazz. R&B, funk and indie rock are on her playlists, too. ""I listen to a lot of different stuff.""

Brzeski also believes the ability to outfit a melody with jazz didn't end with the '60s: ""The are plenty of new songs that would work well as jazz.""

Brzeski is less impressed with contemporary jazz that is only riffs: ""That's more like music for musicians."" For Cobby Brzeski, and soon, she hopes, for the world, melody-based jazz music is a comeback media: ""I'd really like to see it more prominent again.""

1482,"Turns Out That When You Test Rape Kits, You Find Rapists","Photo: Bebeto Matthews/AP

In 2015, Manhattan Attorney General Cy Vance Jr. gave $38 million in forfeiture money to police departments around the country to test the backlog of rape kits. Since then, 64 rapists have been convicted thanks to evidence from the kits, according to the New York Times.



The money was distributed widely to police departments around the country, including those in Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Miami, Memphis, Austin, and Kansas City. So far, it has paid for 55,000 kits to be tested.

The new evidence has resulted in 165 prosecutions and 64 new convictions. Some of the DNA evidence tied together unsolved cases that revealed serial rapists and murderers.

From the Times:

In Memphis, the police exhumed the body of Robert Brasher, a hardened criminal from Missouri who had killed himself to avoid capture, and tied him to eight sexual assaults in three states, including three that ended in murder. The key to solving those cases was an untested rape kit from a 14-year-old girl attacked in 1997 that was found to match Mr. Brasher’s DNA profile. [...] Another grant to the Las Vegas police helped solve the rape and murder of Nadia Iverson, whose body was found in May 1997 at a construction site. Her rape kit was not tested until March 2016. Last year, Arthur Sewall, 51, a former police officer, was arrested and charged with her murder after the authorities said his DNA was found to match her attacker’s.

Advertisement

And though the money went to cities around the country, the testing has helped New Yorkers.

“We have solved New York cases with kits tested from Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Texas, Pennsylvania and Virginia,” Vance told the Times.

The problem of untested kits is far from solved. Despite this effort at excavating the backlog, advocates say that there are probably still 250,000 untested kits in the U.S.

Advertisement

“I believe fundamentally there was a gender bias at issue,” Vance said of the backlog at a press conference. “A crime mostly involving women was simply not viewed as important to solve.”

It’s worth noting that Vance decided not to prosecute movie producer Harvey Weinstein for sexual assault in 2015, the same year he allocated to money to rape kit testing. In 2011, he also declined to prosecute a French politician for sexual assault.

In the #metoo era, it’s harder to look like a hero just for doing the bare minimum to address a problem that should have been fixed ages ago.

The number of reported rapes in New York is rising. In an effort to respond, the NYPD has added 55 officers to the division that investigates sexual assault, and named a woman as its chief.

“They believe they’re doing everything they can,” Vance told the Times.",https://splinternews.com/turns-out-that-when-you-test-rape-kits-you-find-rapist-1833281350,2019-03-14T04:05:00Z,Splinter,Couple,"8551 NW 30th Terrace, Doral, FL 33122",FL,33122
1484,Two arrested for allegedly releasing dog to attack ECSO deputies; dog shot and killed,"CLOSE Two Escambia County Sheriff's Office deputies were attacked by a dog while attempting to make an arrest in the Bellview area on Wednesday, and the dog was shot and killed. Pensacola News Journal

A man and a teenager were arrested Wednesday after authorities say they released their dog to attack a pair of deputies who were trying to make an arrest in the Bellview area, leading deputies to shoot and kill the animal.

Two Escambia County Sheriff's Office deputies were dispatched to Deerwood Road at about 11 a.m. in response to a call about a disturbance, said ECSO spokesman Maj. Andrew Hobbs.

The deputies were attempting to make an arrest at a home in the 2100 block of Deerwood Road when Cairo Jones, 34, and a 15-year-old girl who lives at the home allegedly released the dog, which attacked the deputies. Hobbs said the minor assisted in siccing the dog on deputies.

The two deputies received medical treatment for their injuries and were released Wednesday afternoon, according to Hobbs.

Hobbs described the animal as ""large pit bull,"" but the dog's owner disputed that, telling the News Journal the dog was a 4-year-old purebred boxer named Rosco.

Macey Hardenbrook told the News Journal at the scene Wednesday that she owns the dog shot by deputies and lives in the home on Deerwood Road with Jones, her brother and her three kids.

Hardenbrook said she was at a job interview and was not present when deputies arrived at her home. But when she returned home, she said she briefly spoke with deputies and learned that her daughter and Jones had been arrested for allegedly letting the dog loose while deputies were questioning people about a reported disturbance.

""How I gather it, the cops were in there pulling my child’s hair, and (Jones) told my daughter to go let my dog off the chain, which was dumb, but he did and my dog got killed because he hurt some of the police officers,"" Hardenbrook said. ""Because that’s what he was supposed to do.""

Hardenbrook said she was told by deputies that her boyfriend exited the mobile home during questioning and jumped up and down on their backyard trampoline, and a sack of marijuana fell out of his pocket.

Hardenbrook said deputies told her when the dog became excited and started biting deputies, they tried to verbally calm the dog before ultimately shooting it.

Multiple ECSO patrol vehicles blocked off Deerwood Road on each end of the corner mobile home, where the shooting occurred, for more than an hour.

Animal control arrived at the scene just before noon to retrieve the dog’s body.

Hardenbrook said she thinks a neighbor may have called police after she and her brother got into an argument earlier in the morning.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Jones was in Escambia County Jail on $42,000 bond. He faces charges that include aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer, battery, resisting arrest and marijuana possession.

1485,"Oh, baby: April the Giraffe about to give birth again","ALBANY, N.Y. - Tail held aside? Check. Udders filled? Check. Swelling backside? Check. April the Giraffe shows every sign she'll soon deliver her calf, to the delight of an enthralled YouTube audience.

""April is eating, eating, eating and eating,"" Jordan Patch, owner of Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York, said Tuesday afternoon. ""We continue to sit and wait. The physical development and signs suggest we are there, it's just a matter of when.""

Since Patch announced in a March 6 Facebook post that the delivery was imminent, tens of thousands of fans have been tuned into April's livestream, posting a constant stream of comments and observations. It's a replay of 2017, when April drew more than 232 million YouTube live views during the seven weeks leading up to the birth of Tajiri, her fifth calf.

This time, Patch doesn't expect the suspense to stretch out so long. ""If we hit April 1, I'll be absolutely shocked, based on the observations we're seeing in house,"" he said.

When he started livestreaming April's pregnancy in 2017, Patch never expected to draw worldwide attention to his small zoo 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of New York City.

""We were helping our local fan base tune in,"" Patch said. ""Then it grew to what it became, and we were no longer just informing a small population, we were educating a world of interested parties.""

At any given moment, 50,000 to 60,000 people are watching the livestream and discussing giraffes, Patch said. That ""is bringing awareness to the cause, which is conservation,"" he said. Giraffe numbers in Africa have plunged by 40 percent over the last 30 years, leaving fewer than 100,000 today, according to the nonprofit Giraffe Conservation Foundation.

Not everyone is celebrating, however. ""Another giraffe calf will be born into captivity, doomed to spend his or her life in confinement, all for one roadside zoo's desire for internet fame and profit,"" blogger Katherine Sullivan wrote on People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' website in July.

Patch bristles at suggestions the giraffe cam is motivated by money.

""The entire event is free to the world,"" he said. ""No one has to pay a cent to participate here. But people are so compelled and moved that they want to support what's happening.""

Some of the most ardent April fans are people coping with illness who see the livestream and convivial chat as a welcome distraction. Penina Scullion of Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, commented on Animal Adventure Park's Facebook page that she and her dying 21-year-old daughter Julia watched avidly from the hospital as April gave birth in 2017. This time, she's watching alone.

""Bittersweet calf watch for me, but wishing the best for April and her calf,"" Scullion wrote. ""Hey, if it's a girl, consider Julia for her name?""

1488,"Mother who confessed to killing 11-year-old daughter is on suicide watch, deputies say","Related Headlines Woman stabbed daughter to stop her from having sex

- Orange County Sheriff's deputies say a mother who confessed to fatally stabbing her 11-year-old daughter is on suicide watch this morning.

Deputies say Rosa Rivera confessed to killing her daughter to stop her from having sex with men, something she denied doing.

But, investigators don't exactly buy the story.

""Our investigation revealed that Rosa Rivera killed her daughter because she wanted to prevent her from having sexual relations with men. But we believe that part of the investigation is unfounded.""

On Sunday, 28-year-old Rosa Alcides Rivera arrived at the Winnie Palmer Hospital in Orlando at 10:51 a.m. with her 11-year-old deceased in the front passenger seat. Security and hospital personnel went to assist Rivera when, according to the arrest affidivat, they found the victim.

Security detained Rivera when they observed a knife in her hand with a red substance on it that was consisent with blood, police reported. Rivera had a large but superficial cut on her left arm. When asked if she had more injuries, she said that she had killed her daughter and that ""my baby is gone.""

The 11-year-old girl, Aleyda Rivera, was found with 15 stab wounds on or near her back. She also had a defensive wound on her right arm.

A responding officer soon arrived and arrested Rivera. Police, according to the arrest affidavit, determined that the incident occurred at a residence on Citadel Drive. Earlier that morning, Rivera started pounding on their door and accused her mother's boyfriend of having a sexual relationship with her daughter.

Rivera has yet to go before a judge.

1489,"Netflix, 'Longmire' star Bailey Chase talks growing up in Naples, career","Actor and Naples native Bailey Chase co-stars in a new Netflix Original movie, ""Walk Ride Rodeo."" (Photo: Photo courtesy of Greg Peters)

Bailey Chase for years has played the character viewers often dislike.

The Naples native and father of three says he's enjoying his new roles including the new Netflix Original ""Walk. Ride. Rodeo."" that premiered earlier this month.

Chase, 46, gained prominence for his acting from 2012 to 2017 on the western crime series ""Longmire,"" in which he played the role of an ambitious Wyoming sheriff's deputy, Branch Connally.

“More than anything, the arc that I got to do on 'Longmire,' that character Branch, he hit all the notes,"" Chase said in a recent telephone interview.

""It gave me a confidence as an actor that I could do anything, I could play good. I could play bad. And by portraying these newer characters, that’s how I connect with the audience more. Then they start rooting for you.”

In his latest role, Chase plays Cory Snyder, the real-life father of Amberley Snyder, a successful rodeo barrel racer who returns to the sport after a car crash.

Bailey and his wife Amy have three children: twin 2-year-olds (a boy and a girl) and a 4-year-old daughter who was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when Chase was still shooting ""Longmire.""

“For me as a dad, to play that role, as an actor, you go to those places where I’m imagining my girl in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair,"" Bailey said.

“Since 'Longmire' and becoming a dad, I feel like I can play anything.”

Happy Mother’s Day to all the amazing Mama’s out there (miss you Mom) and to my beautiful wife for these 3 little backseat drivers ❤️🚌 pic.twitter.com/dln0pQr4cT — Bailey Chase (@Bailey_Chase) May 13, 2018

He grew up in Naples, living in the seaside town from age 4 through his freshman year at Naples High School. He transferred to the Bolles School in Jacksonville where he played football and baseball and graduated from the private school before heading to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

After graduating from Duke with a bachelor's degree in sports psychology, Chase said, he decided to fulfill ""a boyhood dream"" and headed to Los Angeles instead of New York.

""I came out here, being a Florida boy,"" Chase said. ""The climate was a little bit better. I was living at the beach, waiting tables and going to acting class.”

He eventually traveled overseas to become a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), to study Shakespeare.

When he returned to the U.S., he landed a role on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" a television series that ran from 1997 to 2003. For the next few years, Chase portrayed Chris Robert Hughes on the soap opera ""As The World Turns.""

He co-starred as ""Becks"" Scott in the ABC comedy-drama ""Ugly Betty,"" which ran from 2006 to 2010, and on the TNT series ""Saving Grace"" that was ran between 2007 and 2010.

But his most notable role came in 2012, when he began on ""Longmire"" that began on the A&E channel and, later, Netflix. Actor Robert Taylor starred as Walt Longmire, a stoic, rugged, no-nonsense sheriff who revealed his Australian accent away from the camera, Chase said.

""He’s a good dude,"" Chase said of Taylor. ""It was a strong cast. We were all distinctly different.”

Longmire"" also co-starred actress Kate Sackhoff and actors Lou Diamond Phillips and Gerald McRaney, known for his TV roles on ""Major Dad"" and ""Simon & Simon"" that Chase said he grew up watching.

Upcoming work for Chase include a role this summer on season 4 of ""Queen of the South,"" a crime drama on the USA Network. Chase said he's been flying to New Orleans for filming and returning home to LA every weekend.

All he said he could reveal about his character is that he's ""a jazz musician with a dark past.""

Chase said he still has family in Florida, including a brother who's a builder based in Ocala. He hasn't been in Naples for more than a decade but hopes to visit again one day.

“Growing up down there, I couldn’t wait to get out,"" he said of Naples.

""But once I got into my 20s and my 30s, I always enjoyed coming back home. Naples will always be home. It's so humid; it just has a feel and a smell. It’s very nostalgic for me.”

1490,Authorities warn of car burglaries during spring break,"PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - Law enforcement is warning spring breakers to be alert and lock up their vehicles.

Maria Campos had her van stolen outside a St. Pete K-Mart last year.

""I can't believe it. The keys were in my pocket. They do something wrong with the wires and stuff,"" she said.

The van, which had all her fishing gear, was later recovered.

""I talked to the girl and said, 'please call the police.' The police come and say, 'nothing I can do,'"" said Campos.

She believes it was teenagers who took her vehicle.

""They looking for something for $5, $10,"" she said.

St. Pete police said auto burglaries and car thefts spike during spring break.

""Stolen cars and auto burglaries are crimes of opportunity. So if you have a bunch of teenagers for example , who are out of school, who are getting bored, looking for something to do, they see a bunch of locked cars, they'll find something else to do,"" said Yolanda Fernandez with St. Petersburg Police Department.

Majority of the cars burglarized in Pinellas County in 2017 were unlocked vehicles, mostly by teens.

Police said they have to constantly warn people.

""If we can remind them to keep their valuables out of view, lock their cars, make sure they have everything in the trunk that's secure, that really eliminates a big problem for us,"" said Fernandez.

Campos no longer takes chances.

""You can't do nothing no more, you have to lock it,"" she said.

1494,Man and girl arrested in November attack and armed robbery with a hammer,"A man accused of hitting another man in the back of the head with a hammer and robbing him in November has been arrested, authorities say.

A 15-year-old girl was also arrested in the incident, according to booking reports. The News-Press is not releasing the girl's name because of her age.

The victim, 19-year-old Christian Tyler Tapia, was taken to Cape Coral Hospital. He suffered a depressed skull fracture and two small brain bleeds, a Lee County Sheriff's Office report said.

According to an arrest report, the assault took place at Waterway Park, 5820 Poetry Lane in North Fort Myers on Nov. 16, 2018.

Tapia told detectives with the Lee County Sheriff's Office that he had been spending the night at a friend's house when he received a text message from the 15-year-old girl asking him to meet her at the park to hang out, the report said.

He told detectives he walked alone to the park and was sitting on a bench with two girls when someone came up behind him and hit him in the head with the hammer, the report said. He said he fell to the ground and blacked out.

Once he regained consciousness, Tapia got up off the ground and said he felt odd, could not walk properly and had blood all over him, the report said. He spotted a man walking away with the two girls with the hammer in his hands toward the back fence of the park, according to the report. The man was wearing a red hoodie with the hood pulled up over his head and a white bandanna that covered his entire face except for his eyes, he told detectives in the report.

Tapia said he jumped the park fence and tried to catch up with the man and the girls but lost sight of them when they cut in between houses, according to the report.

Tapia said he called the parents of the friends he had been staying with and they picked him up. Once he was at the hospital, Tapia told detectives he received several text messages asking him if he was OK from the girl and an unfamiliar phone number later identified as the other girl who was there that night, the report said.

Once he was released from the hospital, Tapia gave another statement and said he originally went to the park that night to sell $25 worth of marijuana to the girl at her request. He said he's known her for three years and met her through his brother who was initially friends with her, the report said.

The three would often meet at the park every few weeks, according to his statement in the report.

Detectives met with the girl, searched her phone and then met with the other girl who was present that night, the report said. She spoke to detectives and advised that the suspect, 20-year-old Zachary Creech, and her friend were in a relationship and told her to bring money to buy marijuana, the report said.

They then planned to rob and attack Tapia, the report said. Creech allegedly brought a croquet mallet from the girl's home to the park, the report said.

The girls and Tapia were sitting on a park bench under a pavilion around 9 p.m. when Creech allegedly came up behind Tapia from a wooded area and struck him in the back of the head, the report said.

The girl said in her statement that the sound of the blow was loud and there was a lot of blood, which she said frightened her, according to the report. The three of them ran out of the park and were followed by Tapia, but they eventually lost sight of him and hid, the report said.

They then returned to the girl's home and cleaned off the mallet, hiding it, the report said.

The girl who spoke to detectives said she got Tapia's phone number from her friend and texted him because she was concerned, but her friends showed no remorse for what they had done, the report said. Her friend instructed her to delete her texts to the victim and lie to law enforcement if they contacted her, the report said.

She picked her friend and Creech out of a line up, the report said.

While arresting Creech, detectives tried to find the mallet but were not able to, the report said.

Creech faces charges of robbery with a weapon and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the report said.

A 17-year-old girl was arrested on similar charges resulting from a November incident in Lehigh Acres.

1498,Did you know these celebrities were once Girl Scouts?,"As we approach the Girl Scouts of the USA's birthday, it's important to look at the women who have emerged from the organization and have carried on the legacy of what it means to be a Scout through time.

While some of these women went to work in entertainment, others carried their expertise into the fields of science and sports. Not only that, some of America's first ladies were once Scouts, and even the queen of England has the title of former Girl Guide.

Here are some of the most notable former Girl Scouts.

Laura Bush

While in office as first lady, Laura Bush became the honorary president of the Girl Scouts and celebrated the organization's 90th birthday. Even after her time as the organization's president ended, she remained connected by celebrating its 100th birthday by remembering her time as a Scout and the life lessons she learned along the way.

Michelle Obama

While she was first lady from 2009 to 2017, Michelle Obama took on the role of honorary president of the Girl Scouts. She attended events with the organization, oversaw operations and even made a camping ground on the front lawn of the White House.

Queen Elizabeth II

Queen Elizabeth II was a Girl Guide growing up, which is what Girl Scouts were referred as in the United Kingdom, and she still recognizes troops today. To carry on her pride, she highlighted a number of former Girl Guides on her Queen Elizabeth's II New Year's Honor's List, for their effort in support girls and young women.

Shirley Temple

Shirley Temple grew up as a child star and was revered for her rosy cheeks and pin-curled hair. As an adult, she was a U.S. Ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia, and served as chief of protocol of the United States, carrying on the Girl Scout principles of courage and character.

Mariah Carey

The singer and songwriter, who is known for her vocal range and the many awards under her belt, first started out as Girl Scout. Although she hasn't spoke much about her time in the organization, she has certainly carried on the confidence she learned as a Scout.

Carrie Fisher
