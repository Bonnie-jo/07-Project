A Florida radio station is in the news again thanks to a controversial contest.

For the second year in a row, Fort Myers's 103.9 is giving away a round of in vitro fertilization for a couple struggling with infertility.

The man behind the giveaway, host Jason “Big Mama” Jones told Fox 4 News last year that he and his wife came up with the idea after turning to IVF.

""I know the struggle so I know it was going to change someone's life,"" said Sara Jones, Big Mama's wife.

“And we realized one in eight people struggle with infertility and we said, ‘Hey, let’s make a miracle happen,'"" Big Mama added.

The radio station has partnered with IVFMD in Naples and S.M.P. pharmacies to make the contest happen.

Those who would like to enter the contest must submit a four-minute video on the station's website.

“Tell us your story, tell the world why you want to be a parents,” said Big Mama. “You have to go to B1039.com right now and get ready. Upload your video this Monday.""

The contests runs through June 7 and the winner will be announced on June 19.",http://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-radio-station-holds-another-win-a-baby-contest/1996696631,2019-05-11T21:38:17Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

6,Southwest Airlines updates family boarding policy after Florida same-sex couple claims discrimination,"CLOSE A same-sex couple from Naples, Florida said Southwest Airlines denied them family boarding with their children in 2017. The airline updated its family boarding policy in 2019. Wochit, Wochit

Southwest Airlines has updated its family boarding policy nearly two years after a same-sex Naples couple with children said they faced discrimination by a boarding agent.

The revised policy says “two adults” can board together with children under 6 during family boarding. The policy had read “an adult” can board.

“We are happy with the resolution,” said Grant Morse, 56, who said he faced discrimination in 2017 by a gate agent and considered legal action.

The airline issued a statement that confirmed the policy was updated but refuted Morse’s account of what happened, as it did two years ago. The airline said no discrimination occurred.

“Never has Southwest’s Family Boarding Policy taken into account gender or marital status when determining ability to board early,” the statement said.

The airline investigated what happened and said there was “confusion in the boarding area surrounded the number, not the genders, of adults allowed early access to the aircraft in our Family Boarding,” the statement said.

From 2017: Same-sex couple says Southwest Airlines discriminated against them

“Both parents were allowed to board early with their children but we requested a third adult board with her assigned group,” the airline said.

Morse said his family faced discrimination May 20, 2017, during boarding for a Southwest Airlines flight from Buffalo, New York, to Fort Lauderdale. The family's story garnered international attention.

Morse was traveling with his husband, Sam Ballachino, their three young children, and Ballachino’s mother, who was helping with the children.

The gate agent allowed a heterosexual couple with a child — who were in line behind Morse and Ballachino — to board but stopped Morse and his family.

“She said, ‘This is not for you,’” Morse said, recalling the incident. “It was clearly discriminatory behavior. We were clearly profiled.”

The gate agent’s supervisor backed up the agent, and the family had to wait until the entire plane had boarded.

Morse said he was told four seats were saved for them in the back of the plane, but that was not enough for all of them to sit together.

Morse sat in the back with his twin sons, and his daughter was in a seat in front of him. His husband was a few seats away. Ballachino’s mother was seated in an emergency exit row.

After landing, Morse contacted Southwest to complain. He received a generic response that the airline was sorry for the family’s experience.

More: Delta, Korean Air apologize after teens kicked off of plane because of peanut allergy

Southwest Airlines said in a statement in 2017 that the agent at the gate followed policy and both parents were invited to board. The third adult was ineligible to board and was asked to wait.

“The conversation in the boarding area had nothing to do with discrimination,” the 2017 statement said. “We welcomed both parents to board the aircraft with their children. The parents expressed disappointment that the Family Boarding policy did not apply to another member of their group.”

After the media publicity, Southwest Airlines offered a $300 voucher and another generic apology, Morse said. He wanted direct communication with airline executives.

He contacted the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, a nonprofit agency for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality. The center asked for help from Orrick, an international law firm.

“A year later we were filing suit and the attorneys were working back and forth, and (Southwest) said that they would like to meet us at their corporate headquarters,” Morse said.

Twenty airline executives, three corporate attorneys and one outside attorney for the airline met with the couple in Dallas on July 13, 2018.

The executives listened to the couple’s story and individually apologized, Morse said.

“They told us that change would come, they said change takes a lot of time,” he said.

In a statement, Southwest said the meeting was productive and friendly.

“The conversation prompted a closer look at the clarity of our policy through the viewpoints of both our customers and employees,” the statement said.

Last month, the Orrick attorney, Alvin Lee, was contacted by the airline and informed of the policy update effective May 1, 2019.

“We were able to engage in meaningful discussions with Southwest regarding the challenges that LGBTQ families face in their everyday lives,” Lee said in an email. “I am pleased that Southwest has taken certain steps to update its Family Boarding Policy, and that it is attempting to make its airline more welcoming for LGBTQ families.”

Morse said he now believes the 2017 incident occurred because of one rogue employee.

The airline in general is known for its diversity policy with employees, he added.

Since the 2017 incident, the family has not flown Southwest.

“Where we are today, we are reconsidering,” he said.

It was a Florida battle between David and Goliath, and the smart money was on Goliath in this swamp scuffle.

Jesse and Linda Waring of BirdWalk Photography spotted the fracas while visiting the Circle B Bar Reserve in Lakeland on Saturday. After hearing a splash, the couple noticed it was feeding time for the gator.

Luckily, Linda is quick on the draw with a camera and was able to snap some amazing photographs that show how it's a ""eat or be eaten"" world in the wild.

While the snake put up a fight and a strong attempt to slither away, the entire altercation was over in 10 minutes and the gator was back out looking for his next bite.

24,Florida couple busted after posing as detectives to free 'partner' from jail,"DESOTO COUNTY, Fla. - A Florida duo was more Laurel & Hardy than Starsky & Hutch when they were caught posing as detectives to free their ""partner"" from jail.

Francine Olson and Brandon Reyes were arrested Tuesday after telling DeSoto County dispatchers that they were new detectives while the two attempted to gain access to the jail.

Olson and Reyes were trying to spring George Chanza from behind bars. Chanza had been arrested recently on an outstanding warrant.

Instead, the couple are now joining their ""partner"" in jail after they were arrested for False Personation of a Law Enforcement Officer.

25,Florida's new texting and driving law: What you need to know,"Barring an unexpected veto, Florida will soon have a new texting and driving law. Here's a look at the bill that passed the Legislature during last week's flurry of votes.

Texting and driving was already illegal in Florida. How does the new bill change the law?

The new law advances Florida’s rule against texting while driving in a couple of ways. First, it makes texting (including messaging, emailing and other forms of typing on a mobile device) a primary violation, rather than a secondary violation. That means cops can stop you solely on suspicion of texting while driving. Next, it more broadly bans any use of a handheld cellphone while operating a motor vehicle in a designated school crossing or school zone or a road work zone. Hands-free uses remain legal.

What are the penalties?

The penalties remain the same: a noncriminal traffic infraction that carries a $30 base fine plus court costs and fees for a first violation; a second violation within five years after that is considered a moving violation carrying a $60 base fine plus court costs and fees. Drivers caught texting will also be dinged 3 points against their licenses.

When does the law go into effect?

Assuming no veto, texting while driving becomes a primary offense on July 1. The ban on handheld use in school and work zones can be enforced starting Oct. 1, with an education period of warnings until Jan. 1, when fines can be imposed. ""During the education period drivers that are pulled over can fight the ticket by proving they purchased an item that allows them to go hands-free while driving,"" said Rep. Jackie Toledo, R-Tampa, one of the co-sponsors of the bill.

What is allowed?

Texting at a stoplight or while a vehicle is stationary is not an offense. Emergency personnel are exempted, as are people reporting an emergency or criminal activity to police and those receiving messages related to the navigation or operation of their vehicle or safety-related information such as emergency traffic or weather alerts.

Does this ban make Florida an outlier?

No. Research by AAA, the motor club, shows 44 other states make texting while driving a primary offense.

Was this bill controversial?

Not particularly. It passed the House 108-7 and the Senate 33-5. Texting and driving has, however, been debated in Florida for the better part of this century. One of the concerns was that this would give law enforcement another way to target black motorists. The new law will require a degree of accountability on that front. Law-enforcement agencies will have to record the race and ethnicity of violators and report the data to the governor, House speaker and Senate president.

Will the new law be enforceable?

Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said enforcing a law on texting while driving ""is gonna be a little difficult,"" just as it is with seat belts. Officers have to be able to see the violation often while they are driving, and motorists are not required to show or surrender their devices without warrants, which aren't readily available during traffic stops. But ultimately, Chitwood said making texting while driving a primary offense is a step in the right direction. ""It's needed when you think of the lives that have been shattered because of texting and driving.""

Yeah, I get angry at other drivers when I see them texting, but I've been doing it for years and haven't crashed.

Think what you want, but AAA research shows people who text and driver are eight times more likely to be involved in a crash. The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles reported more than 51,000 crashes involving distracted drivers statewide last year. The number of traffic fatalities in Florida has topped 3,000 each year since 2016, a statistic some law-enforcement officials say is due in part to distracted driving. Mark Jenkins, a spokesman for AAA, said: ""When driving without seat belts became a primary violation, more people began wearing seat belts. We're hoping as a result of this law, fewer drivers will text.""",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190507/floridas-new-texting-and-driving-law-what-you-need-to-know?rssfeed=true,2019-05-07T20:22:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
26,Armed detention deputy accused in road rage incident in Florida Keys,"Jatavi Wendall Lee told deputies that he was running late for work at the Stock Island jail.

KEY LARGO, Fla. - A Monroe County detention deputy was arrested Tuesday after authorities said he drove erratically, nearly causing multiple collisions, and then berated one of the drivers while armed and in uniform.

Jatavi Wendall Lee, 35, of Miami, faces charges of reckless driving and obstructing a highway.

Adam Linhardt, a spokesman for the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, said the incident happened March 29 when Lee was driving along the Overseas Highway in Key Largo.

A motorist who witnessed Lee's reckless driving contacted the Monroe County Sheriff's Office and provided deputies with video of the incident from his dashboard camera, Linhardt said.

Witnesses told deputies that Lee was driving at high rate of speed and weaving in and out of lanes. Linhardt said Lee almost caused two collisions with his erratic maneuvers.

At one point, Lee, while driving an unmarked black car, illegally passed a white pickup truck, Linhardt said. After Lee passed the truck, he abruptly stopped, causing drivers behind him to slam on their brakes to avoid a crash, deputies said. Lee then got out of the car and shouted obscenities at the driver of the pickup truck, witnesses said.

Wearing a Sheriff's Office uniform and gun belt, Lee told the truck driver to “never do that again,” saying the truck driver didn't know where he was going, Lindhardt said.

The truck driver, a retired firefighter, said he did not report incident out of respect for law enforcement, but once he was contacted by deputies he corroborated the account of the man with the dashboard camera. The truck driver said Lee did not use any police lights during the stop. Linhardt added that as a detention deputy, Lee was not authorized to make traffic stops.

When questioned by deputies, Lee said he was running late for work at the Stock Island jail and admitted to driving erratically and stopping traffic.

At the time of the incident, Linhardt said Lee, who was hired as a detention deputy in 2017, was on probation in Miami-Dade County after he pleaded no contest to domestic battery and theft of a license plate tag in 2018.

According to Miami Gardens police, Lee slapped the mother of one of his children across the face when he ran into her and her new boyfriend at his child's day care center. He then followed the woman to a nearby gas station, where he stole the woman's license plate and threatened to shoot the couple, police said.

In 2009, Lee was accused of battery against the same woman.

The Monroe County Sheriff's Office has started the process to terminate Lee. He will have a hearing to determine whether he will be terminated on May 13. In the meantime, Lee has been placed on leave without pay and ordered to turn in his badge and uniform.

""I take these incidents very seriously,"" Sheriff Rick Ramsay said in a statement. ""I expect the highest level of professional conduct from Sheriff's Office staff. This type of behavior will never be tolerated under my leadership as reflected in the actions we have taken.""

27,Florida's new texting & driving law: What you need to know,"The new rules hit July 1, if it isn't vetoed by Governor DeSantis

Barring an unexpected veto, Florida will soon have a new texting and driving law. Here's a look at the bill that passed the Legislature during last week's flurry of votes.

Texting and driving was already illegal in Florida. How does the new bill change the law?

The new law advances Florida’s rule against texting while driving in a couple of ways. First, it makes texting (including messaging, emailing and other forms of typing on a mobile device) a primary violation, rather than a secondary violation. That means cops can stop you solely on suspicion of texting while driving. Next, it more broadly bans any use of a handheld cell phone while operating a motor vehicle in a designated school crossing or school zone or a road work zone. Hands-free uses remain legal.

What are the penalties?

The penalties remain the same: a noncriminal traffic infraction that carries a $30 base fine plus court costs and fees for a first violation; a second violation within five years after that is considered a moving violation carrying a $60 base fine plus court costs and fees. Drivers caught texting will also be dinged 3 points against their licenses.

When does the law go into effect?

Assuming no veto, texting while driving becomes a primary offense on July 1. The ban on handheld use in school and work zones can be enforced starting Oct. 1, with an education period of warnings until Jan. 1, when fines can be imposed. ""During the education period drivers that are pulled over can fight the ticket by proving they purchased an item that allows them to go hands-free while driving,"" said Rep.

28,Former Florida State players finding success in the NBA,"Florida State isn't a name that is commonly associated with putting players in the NBA.

But that could be changing with the recent trend of success by three former Seminoles.

Denver Nuggets guard Malik Beasley, Charlotte Hornets guard Dwayne Bacon, and Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac all took big steps forward this season as they continue to adjust to the NBA.

""I’m extremely proud of them and the type of people they have become,"" FSU coach Leonard Hamilton told the Tallahassee Democrat.

""The fact that they’re having success at the highest level of basketball is not a surprise to us at all.""

It didn't start off very well for any of the trio.

Beasley was the first one-and-done player in program history, but struggled his rookie year in 2016-17 with the Nuggets playing in just 22 games and averaging 3.8 points. He averaged 15.6 points per game during the 2015-16 season at FSU.

Bacon came in with Beasley in the 2015 recruiting class, but spent two years at FSU. He played 53 games his rookie season, but averaged just 3.3 points per game and played just 13.5 minutes per game. Bacon averaged 15.8 points per game for FSU in 2015-16 and 17.2 points per game in his final season in 2016-17.

Isaac was selected with the sixth pick of the 2017 NBA Draft by the Magic, but struggled with injuries. He played in just 27 games and averaging 5.4 points and 3.7 rebounds per game. He averaged 12 points and 7.8 rebounds per game during the 2016-17 season at FSU.

""Sometimes it’s very difficult,"" Hamilton said.

""When you’re going in with very little experience coming out of college when you’re one-and-done or two-and-out, people have grown to have high expectations for first and second-year players.""

Beasley played in 62 games during his second season, but scored just 3.3 points per game.

He was playing well his first two months of this season, but he really found his groove in December. His points per game jumped up to 12.7 and continued to rise. He averaged 14.2 points per game in January and 16.5 points per game in February this season.

Beasley has averaged 11.3 points per game so far this season, but his season isn't over yet. The Nuggets are fighting for a spot in the Western Conference Finals against Portland.

With that series tied 2-2, Beasley is averaging 9.8 points and 3.5 rebounds per game. He's shooting 40.8% from three.

""He has always shown the potential to put the ball in the basket,"" Hamilton said.

""His athleticism gives him a chance to participate in every game. Malik is a very competitive youngster. I think what you’re seeing is his character coming through. The talent has always been there. Once he’s matured in the league and understands what is expected of him, I still expect him to get better and better.""

Bacon and Isaac also took steps forward this season.

Isaac helped the Magic make the playoffs and averaged 9.6 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks per game in his second year. He also played in 75 games, alleviating some of the injury concerns from his rookie season.

Bacon played in 43 games and more than doubled his scoring output averaging 7.3 points per game. He shot 43.7% from beyond the arc

""I expect them to keep getting better and better,"" Hamilton said.

""We watched them every day. They have tremendous character with tremendous basketball IQs. They have made the adjustment very, very well, and I think their basketball is still ahead of them.""

FSU could add a couple more players to the NBA ranks this year with Mfiondu Kabengele and Terance Mann. Kabengele is being projected as a first round pick by multiple pundits, while Mann is being projected in the second round.

Both players have skill sets that will make them viable in the NBA and their success would only add to the reputation of the FSU program. The reputation that Bacon, Beasley, and Isaac have helped build along with the recent NCAA tournament success.

With the talent that FSU is bringing in this year to go along with the players currently on the roster, the NBA could be seeing a lot more Seminoles moving forward.

31,Florida Historical Society's May 16-18 conference: 'Countdown to History: Ice Age to the Space Age',"CLOSE Trailer for Trench media's upcoming documentary looking back at the moon landing in 1969. Florida Today

The 2019 Florida Historical Society Annual Meeting and Symposium is being held May 16-18 at the Radisson Resort at the Port in Cape Canaveral. The theme of the conference is “Countdown to History: Ice Age to the Space Age.”

Dozens of presenters from throughout the state and beyond will discuss a wide variety of topics related to Florida history and culture.

Glen Doran is a local hero to archaeology enthusiasts. In the mid-1980s, Doran was principal archaeologist for the Windover Dig, a world famous excavation that uncovered an ancient pond cemetery in north Brevard County.

Nearly 200 remarkably well preserved human burials were uncovered, that were between 7,000 and 8,000 years old. The bodies were wrapped in the oldest woven cloth found in North America, and 91 of the skulls contained intact brain matter.

Doran will open the FHS conference with the presentation “Windover and Beyond: 35 Years of Archaeology on the Space Coast.”

“I’m looking forward to being back in the area,” Doran said. “I’m sure that some of the people that worked on the Windover crew will be coming to the talk. One of the things that made this work particularly satisfying was the level of community involvement.”

Conference attendees will take a tour of the Brevard Museum of History and Natural Science in Cocoa, where artifacts from the Windover Dig are displayed.

They will also visit the Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore Cultural Complex in Mims, which includes a civil rights museum, a reflecting pool, and a replica of the Moore family home.

On Christmas night, 1951, a bomb exploded under the Moore’s home. The couple died from injuries sustained in the blast, making them the first martyrs of the contemporary civil rights movement. Harry T. Moore traveled throughout the state registering African Americans to vote.

“Harry Moore, of course, being an educated person, knew that power lay in the ballot box,” said Bill Gary, president of the Moore Cultural Complex. “If you cannot elect a person like yourself, then you try to use your voting power to vote for those persons who, at least, express some interest in your concerns.”

Gary’s work at the Moore Cultural Complex has earned him the Florida Historical Society’s Lifetime Achievement Award, which will be presented at the conference banquet dinner.

The 50th anniversary of the first manned mission to the moon is another focal point of the upcoming Florida Historical Society Annual Meeting and Symposium. Historian Lori Walters has spent decades documenting the impact of the space program on Brevard County. She will be moderating “A Conversation with Apollo-Era Space Workers” including Al Koller, Bill Heink, John Tribe, and Bill Waldren.

“Project Mercury is designed to get an American into space,” Walters said. “Then Project Gemini is there to provide all the links that we need to prove that a human being can survive fourteen days in a tin can orbiting the earth, we can rendezvous, we can do a spacewalk, and all these things that we have to prove to ultimately land a man on the moon. Running alongside that is Apollo.”

Much of the technology needed to complete a lunar mission did not exist when President John F. Kennedy declared in May 1961, that America would land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth before the end of the decade.

“Saturn 5 doesn’t exist yet,” Walters said. “The very craft that you need, the Apollo craft itself, and the booster, they don’t even exist yet.”

Local space workers would rise to the challenge, of course, and Kennedy’s vision was realized in July 1969, with five months to spare.

The FHS conference will include a tour of the Kennedy Space Center.

Former astronaut Winston Scott will help to commemorate the Apollo 11 moon landing with his keynote presentation “From the Cape into Space: The Adventures of a NASA Astronaut.”

“I remember sitting in front of my television watching those old grainy pictures, when Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon,” Scott recalled. “I was a freshman in college, and I can remember how exciting that was.”

Registration information and discounted hotel rates for the conference are online at myfloridahistory.org, or call 321-690-1971 ext. 217.

Dr. Ben Brotemarkle is executive director of the Florida Historical Society. He’s also host of “Florida Frontiers: The Weekly Radio Magazine of the Florida Historical Society” and the public television series “Florida Frontiers.” More information is at www.myfloridahistory.org.

32,Florida python hunter stumbles upon creepy scene right out of The Blair Witch Project,"Mike Kimmel is accustomed to wading into the blackness of the Everglades at night searching for invasive Burmese pythons as a paid bounty hunter for the South Florida Water Management District.

But something he stumbled upon last month gave even the hard-to-startle snake wrangler the creeps.

While hunting near the abandoned Aerojet Dade Rocket Facility north of Everglades National Park, he found piles of rocks with upside down crosses painted on them, spooky baby dolls with crosses marked in ash on their heads and what looked like a bloody gown in a room where “She was only 9” was spray painted on the wall.

“I was there a couple weeks earlier and none of that was there,” said Kimmel, who in March caught the landmark 2000th python as part of the district’s two-year-old bounty program. “I’m kind of used to finding creepy stuff but this was way over the top and seems real deal authentic.”

View this post on Instagram

Found some real deal satanic ritual evidence out in the middle of the Everglades at an old abandoned government facility.... was pretty crazy, especially to find a snake wrapped around the doll at the first sight I came across... really wish I didn't touch it or the doll lol but I didn't know everything else I would find. The writing in the first video is Latin and says: ""Turn back, run away, flee, hide, run away.."" I also learned the head of this facility during the 60s was discovered to be a satanist and I believe got caught doing some kind of ritual. I tell people all the time about the crazy stuff that goes on out here! #theomenwillfollow #trappermike #pythoncowboy #martincountytrapping #savetheglades #creepy #armorofgod #floridapythonhunters #floridaman #everglades #spooky #florida #aerojet #realflorida #paranormal #occult #adventure

RELATED: The new plan for destroying invasive Burmese pythons

Kimmel, of Indiantown, reported his scary find to his supervisor, and he took video eerily similar to jerky dark footage of the horror film The Blair Witch Project.

“I don’t think it was just some kids trying to scare people,” said Kimmel, who posted some of his experience on Instagram.

District officials said it’s not unusual for people to trespass at the unusual facility built in the 1960s to assemble and test rockets that could send people to the moon.

The rockets were so large a special canal was dug to connect the facility to the Atlantic Ocean so they could be transported by barge. It was abandoned when Aerojet lost a NASA contract and the land was eventually purchased by the South Florida Water Management District.

VIDEO: Massive gator chomps python like chew toy

Some buildings are covered in graffiti, and there are photos online taken by people who skirted a locked gate to hike or bike into the area.

The buildings are crumbling and the Everglades is slowing taking them back, but the fascination of abandoned places remains a lure.

Kimmel said he believes his finds were the vestiges of a Satanic ritual.

“It is quite a hike back there and it would be a whole lot of work to go through just to try to be funny,” he said.

But he’s not deterred from trekking again into the dark, a time when the snakes are out after avoiding the heat of the day.

On Friday, he was headed south for another hunt.

The line of severe storms moved over the I-4 corridor fast between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. By 4 p.m. the line was over Brevard and Volusia Counties. Volusia County experienced persistent thunderstorms since late morning Sunday.

Storms brought frequent lightning and 1 to 2 inches of rain Sunday afternoon, with strong wind gusts between 40 and 50 mph. Wind gusts between 50 and 65 mph and quarter size hail were reported across parts of Central Florida. Trees down near Lake Underhill was reported by a Channel viewer.

THE FORECAST

By 4 p.m., the last line of storms was along the coast and only a few lingering, light to moderate showers, inland. The weather conditions will become more stable and severe weather will no longer be a threat for the late afternoon into the evening.

Sunday evening will be partly cloudy with low temperatures in the low 70s.

The good news! The front came with more oomph than expected and it will be able to cross the Peninsula and provide mostly stable conditions for the beginning of the work week. There highest chance for rain and scattered storms will be over the Treasure Coast to South Florida Monday afternoon.

Monday afternoon will be hot! Temperatures will be close to 90 degrees, but will feel as if they were in the mid-90s. Make sure to stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade if you work outdoors.

Rain chances increase once again Wednesday afternoon, with the winds coming from the east-southeast, providing plenty of moisture. We will continue to closely monitor the weather and update you on TV, online and our WFTV Weather app.

These storms are no joke. Packed with lightning and strong gusts. Please stay indoors.

Coastal Counties (S. Volusia thru Brevard) they will arrive within a couple hours. #stormalert9 https://t.co/7HTgjMoczD — Irene Sans (@IreneSans) May 5, 2019

WHAT ABOUT TROPICAL DEVELOPMENT?

The National Hurricane Center no longer gives the area of disturbed weather a chance of developing. It will remain over the western Atlantic and the cold front will keep it over the water, dissipating it. This area does not represent a threat to Florida.

Our team of certified meteorologists are on duty, and will continue to monitor the weather and bring you prompt updates on our WFTV Weather app and on wftv.com.

37,Chinese visitor returns with a head full of Florida agriculture,"WINTER HAVEN — If cross-cultural ties indeed make the world smaller, the earth has shrunk a bit this past week after Allen and Kate Morris opened their Winter Haven home to Ye Caiyun, a Chinese agricultural official.

“My first U.S. visit has been the most rewarding and educational visit in my life,” Ye, 53, told The Ledger on Thursday, the day before her return trip to China. “This memory will last forever.”

The couple met Ye in 2011, when Allen Morris, a leading Florida citrus economist and consultant, gave a speech at the Navel Orange Festival in Ganzhou, a Chinese city of about 10 million people in Jiangxi Province, also a citrus-growing area. Ye served as their host and translator.

Since 1995, Ye has worked as a senior project officer at the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau for the city of Ganzhou. Her job entails working with international agencies, such as the World Bank and the United Nation’s International Fund for Agricultural Development, to advance agriculture in the province.

That’s how Ye honed her English fluency, she said.

“I’ve worked with many international experts,” Ye said. “When you work with international experts, their mother tongue is English.”

The job also calls for her to translate many scientific and other English-language articles into Chinese. Ye has studied English since junior high school.

Ye and the Morrises have emailed regularly since 2011, Allen Morris said, and when she expressed an interest in visiting the United States, the economist used his connections to set up a whirlwind tour of Florida citrus and agriculture. He also helped with arrangements for her visits to New York and Washington, D.C. from April 21 to 26, when she arrived in Florida.

“I’m always glad to help someone learn about Florida agriculture,” Morris said. “I think all the Florida agriculture she saw got her excited about what we have to offer.”

Ye’s Florida trip included tours of a tangerine grove owned by W.G. Roe & Sons Inc. of Winter Haven; the University of Florida’s Citrus Research and Education Center in Lake Alfred; the Peace River Ranch in Zolfo Springs, owned by Frostproof-based Ben Hill Griffin Inc.; and the Cutrale Citrus Juices U.S.A. Inc. processing plant in Auburndale. It also included, of course, trips to the Walt Disney World and Universal theme parks in Orlando.

Although her job has taken Ye to more than a dozen countries in Asia and Europe, this was her first trip to the U.S., fulfilling a lifelong desire.

“I’m so interested in your country. I learned so much about your country in books, but I had never been here,” she said. “My experience here has been amazing. It’s a wonderful country.”

Among the dozens of impressions Ye shared with The Ledger about the trip, some common themes were her positive impressions of Florida agriculture’s advanced management practices and of the size of local operations.

“I was very impressed with the good management practices” at the Roe grove, Ye said. “I was very impressed with the cleanliness and awesome organization” at the Cutrale juice plant.

Ye also expressed admiration for how Cutrale not only produced orange juice but found uses for processing byproducts, such as pulp for livestock feed and beverage products, peels for citrus oils and recycled water. All are standard practices at other Florida citrus processing plants.

“They make full use of all their resources,” Ye said. “Most importantly, it is so environmentally friendly. Their great attention to detail makes them a tremendous success.”

Morgan Roe, who guided Ye on her tour of the 100-acre tangerine grove that he manages for his family’s company, said he was equally impressed with her attention to details as revealed in her questions.

“It was a high-level exchange,” Roe said. “She was very interested in the scope of the acreage that she looked at. I think the acreage there is divided into smaller tracts among smaller growers.”

Ye confirmed that was the case.

“She was interested in everything. She wanted to take lots of pictures and was so excited to see the cattle, land and wildlife,” said Ben Hill Griffin IV, Ye’s guide through the Peace River Ranch. “She asked a lot of questions, but also listened carefully as I told her about our ranch. She was a real delight to be with, and she was very grateful and appreciative of the time we spent.”

Her home Jiangxi Province has a few small cattle ranches, Ye said, but nothing of the size and scope of the Griffin operation. They also lack the diverse plant and animal life she saw on the Peace River Ranch.

“I never visited such a big cattle ranch. I was very impressed with and very excited to see so many different varieties of cattle,” she said. “It was so large and densely covered. I saw hawks flying and deer – so many animals co-existing peacefully.”

Jim Graham, emeritus professor of soil microbiology at the Citrus Research Center, served as Ye’s guide through that facility.

Graham was returning a favor, he said, as Ye served as his guide and interpreter during his 2002 trip to Ganzhou as a scientific consultant to the local growers.

During that trip, Graham gave Ye a copy of UF’s standard Citrus Health Management book, he said. When she expressed the desire to translate it, Graham worked on the agreement with the U.S. publisher on allowing publication of the Chinese version around 2010.

“She’s remarkable in that respect. She has an encyclopedic knowledge of citrus management,” Graham said.

Graham could not say what role the Chinese version played in improving local citrus management practices, but he noted, “The Navel oranges grown there are very high quality.”

In 2018, Jiangxi had about 134,000 acres of commercial citrus, mostly Navel oranges, Ye said. It harvested nearly 1.5 million pounds of citrus, including 1.2 million pounds of Navels.

While Ye’s two weeks in the U.S. and Florida amounted to a working vacation, it was very much on her own time and expense and not part of her official duties. That impressed several of her hosts.

“This is her vacation time,” Griffin said. “She said she did not want to spend this time laying around at the beach — she wanted to see Florida agriculture.”

Ye lavished appreciation on all her hosts, and she expressed particularly heartfelt praise for the Morrises. In addition to arranging her itinerary, the couple gave her a free room and food at their home for a week, without which she probably could not afford the trip, she said.

“On my first day here, Allen and Kate told me I should feel at home because this is my home,” Ye said. “I regard this as my home, and I regard them as family.”

40,Florida lawmakers back homeowner front-yard vegetable gardens,"Now's the time to start planning your vegetable garden. (Photo: Bojsha65, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

The Florida House on Wednesday gave final approval to a measure that would prevent local governments from regulating homeowners’ vegetable gardens even in their front yards.

The 93-16 vote will send the bill (SB 82) to Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The issue stems from a dispute between homeowners Hermine Ricketts and Laurence Carroll and the village of Miami Shores over an ordinance that banned front-yard vegetable gardens.

The couple had maintained a front-yard garden for nearly two decades but uprooted their vegetables when faced with the possibility of fines, reportedly $50 a day in the case of the Miami Shores homeowners. They challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance but lost in court, with the Florida Supreme Court last year declining to take up the issue.

House bill sponsor Elizabeth Fetterhoff, R-DeLand, said Wednesday the legislation involves fundamental rights and that government has “no business” telling Floridians they can’t grow their own food, no matter where they live.

“Although simple in nature, this is a very important bill,” Fetterhoff said.

The bill, sponsored in the Senate by Appropriations Chairman Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, cleared the Senate in a 35-5 vote on March 21.

42,Weak disturbance to send rain into Southwest Florida,"Forecast for Thursday, May 2, 2019. (Photo: NBC2)

A weak disturbance over the Bahamas will brush by Southwest Florida today, which means we'll see more scattered areas of rain and storms throughout the day.

Whenever we talk about disturbed weather in the tropics, it certainly gets people's attention. Thankfully, the National Hurricane Center is forecasting little to no development from this disturbance over the next couple of days. Today will just be a little more active than a typical early May day.

We'll see a few isolated areas of rain around this morning as temperatures start out near 70 degrees. More Southwest Florida weather forecast via NBC2 ►

What is a subtropical storm?

Here are the differences between a subtropical and tropical storm:

A subtropical storm has a cold core, while tropical storms have a warm core.

We tend to see subtropical systems develop in the cooler parts of the Atlantic or in the early and late parts of the season.

Tropical storms have a higher potential to quickly grow into hurricane, while subtropical storms do not.

If a subtropical storm remains over warm water for several days, it may eventually become fully tropical

Tropical Storms tend to produce more rain compared to subtropical storms.

Subtropical storms could eventually gain full tropical characteristics. For example, the core of a subtropical storm could warm enough to become tropical storm or even a hurricane.

There is no such thing as a subtropical hurricane.

At the end of the day, when it comes to the winds they produce, there is not a big difference between a subtropical and tropical storm.

51,Lost sketch book returned to former Disney animator,"- A local artist’s sketchbook has been returned to him after he lost it 36 years ago in New Jersey.

It all started in 1983, when artist Thomas Thorspecken was 21 years old and he decided to hit the road.

“I literally found a bicycle for $5 from an ad in the newspaper and that's what I went with,” he said.

He planned to bike and camp across America, from New Jersey to Washington state.

Among his supplies, the future Disney artist packed a sketchbook.

“Most of it was a journal,” he said. “Apparently the first day of the trip it just bounced off the bike.”

A couple in New Jersey found it on the side of the road, took it home and boxed it up.

Now, 36 years later, they tracked Thorspecken down and got it back to him.

“Out of the blue, someone contacted me by email and said I was going through boxes in the house and found your sketchbook,” the artist said.

They mailed it back to him.

Now on Thorspecken's desk, he says the book represents hope.

“Go about your day and keep creating. That's what I've been doing since.”

He went on to work on such Disney films as Pocahontas and The Lion King, and now teaches art.

He says he can't wait to finish filling the sketchbook's pages.

“Someone suggested that - bring this on trips,” Thorspecken said. “I think that's probably what I'm gonna do.”",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/lost-sketch-book-returned-to-former-disney-animator,2019-05-13T01:45:15Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
52,Officer spends time helping children learn to read,"- An officer in Virginia has gone above and beyond the call of duty to make a difference in the lives of a couple of children.

According to the Newport Police Department, MPO C. Hall has volunteeered his time every week to read to a couple of children at their police headquarters.

They said that this started after the children's grandmother brought them in to the headquarters to speak to an officer about the importance of being a good citizen. During this conversation, MPO Hall learned that one of the children was struggling with reading.

MPO Hall then reportedly offered to spend time each week working on their reading skills. These sessions seem to be making a difference, the police department said.

54,Elderly Sarasota couple died in their town house,"Elderly Sarasota couple died in their town house Video

Osprey, FLA - It's odorless, colorless, tasteless, but carbon monoxide gas can be very deadly.



An elderly couple died in their Osprey town house overnight, and the ""silent killer"" may be to blame.

Deputies found one in bed, the other, on the floor.

Neighbors watched in disbelief as Sarasota fire crews worked to ventilate units attached to the home of 88 year old James Livingston and his wife, 81 year old Sharon.



Neighbor and friend, Ernst Waldeck said Sharon was an ex-dean for the University of Boston. James was a physics professor at M.I.T.

They recently sold a home in Boston to move near the water. “It's very tragic because they were looking forward to go back and start that new life at the Boston waterside” said Waldeck.

When Waldeck returned home Thursday night, he noticed the couple's trash cans out, the paper not picked up and a light on inside.

“We rung the bell. There was no answer. So I said, it's late, so I went around the house to look whether i could look into the bedroom, but all the blinds were closed shut” said Waldeck.

Investigators believe carbon monoxide from one of the couple's cars, left running in the garage, may be to blame. “I can't say that's what caused this, cuz it's under investigation, but it is a time for me to warn individuals to take the extra measure to make sure your vehicles are turned off” said Mike Hartley, Sarasota County Assistant Fire Chief.

Carbon monoxide detectors are a sure way to prevent this kind of tragedy.

They are sold at Home Depot, Lowe's and other stores.

No word if the couple had CO detectors in their condo.

56,Southwest Florida golf column: Naples woman makes two aces in four-hole span,"Naples' Kim Spreng made two holes-in-one in a four-hole span on April 26 on the Sabal Course at The Strand. (Photo: Submitted)

Kim Spreng and her husband Rick went out to play a quick nine holes on April 26 on The Sabal Course at The Club at The Strand.

Spreng had no idea how memorable that was going to turn out.

Neither did Kathy Beers when she played at two different courses within a week last month.

Spreng, 53. used a pitching wedge and made a hole-in-one on the 78-yard No. 5.

""The ball's in flight and Rick called and said 'It's going to be a hole-in-one' and I said 'No' and it went in,"" Spreng said. ""It was pretty cool.""

Three holes later, Spreng stepped up on the 80-yard No. 8 with her pitching wedge again.

""(Rick) was in the golf cart and he couldn't see the green, but he could see the flight of the ball, and he said 'Oh, another hole-in-one,'"" she said. ""I just shook my head yes. He said I don't see the ball, and I said 'No, it's in the cup.'

""It's pretty fun. He's still looking for his first.""

As he puts it, her husband has a ""hole-in-three."" He made a hole-in-one on a par 3 after hitting a ball out of bounds.

Spreng is now up to three. Her first was at her home club in Ashland, Ohio, a few years ago. The Sprengs have been coming to Southwest Florida since the late 1990s, bought a place in 2011, and are now retired.

""I played through high school and when I was working, I quite for a while and then started back up probably 15 years ago,"" Spreng said. ""I started playing more and since we retired a couple of years ago. When you live on a golf course, it makes it a lot easier to play more.""

Beers, 73, was playing in the Women's Gulf Coast Interclub tournament at Worthington Golf & Country Club in Bonita Springs on April 15.

""It was our second hole (No. 7), and it was a 119-yard par 3 up a hill and into the wind,"" Beers said. ""I hit it a 7-iron and it just kind of went over the ridge and we never saw it again.""

Beers almost had more excitement. No. 5, a par 3, was their final hole. She hit the flagstick and stopped a foot to the right of the hole.

Ellen Bonn, Mary Ann Rohloff, Mary Pendergast witnessed that one.

A week later, at almost the same time of day, Beers was at her home club, Highland Woods Golf & Country Club, and she came to No. 5, a 93-yard par 3.

""I hit a 9-iron and it just kept rolling around and went in the hole,"" she said. ""We saw that one. I've been playing golf for 50 years and bemoaning the fact that I've never had a hole-in-one.""

Shirley Wood, Marianne Patton, and Wendy Gardner witnessed that ace.

Beers' strong string has continued. On Sunday, her ball went over the edge of the hole on a par 3 and stopped a foot behind.

""All of a sudden, it's been working,"" said Beers, who will head back north to Oconomowoc Golf Club in Wisconsin.



Joe Fitori and Jim Fahey had a different twist on a unique golf feat.

While playing in the same group at Pelican Marsh, Fahey made a hole-in-one on No. 4 from 137 yards out with an 8-iron. Later in the round, Fitori made a double eagle on the 16th hole. Bob Call and John Weaver witnessed each.

57,Florida SouthWestern State College graduates have head start with career paths,"As the “pomp and circumstance” of graduation began, with the song being played by a six-piece jazz band, hundreds of students filed in to celebrate, set to begin the next phase of their lives.

Except many of them already had started.

Florida SouthWestern State College celebrated the graduations of 3,278 students with morning and afternoon ceremonies Friday at Suncoast Credit Union Arena. About 1,000 students participated in the ceremonies.

With packed crowds of about 2,500 family members, friends and professors at each ceremony, they walked to their seats on the arena floor to great applause and fanfare.

Graduates Samantha Fitzpatrick, 20, and Lindsay Guzman, 22, each were tapped to deliver commencement addresses.

Wearing flowing black robes and the traditional black caps, many grads chose to decorate the top of those caps with playful messages. One had a Wonder Woman logo on it and “2019.” One said: “I worked hard so my dog can have a better life.” Another said, “Be Fearless.” It had a cross at the bottom and was adorned with a sunflower and a pink ribbon.

Guzman wrote “Don’t make me use my teacher’s voice” on hers. She already has started the next chapter of her life. She did so in the fall as a third-grade teacher at Manatee Elementary School in Fort Myers.

“What we learned in school, with classroom experience, we could apply to the real world,” Guzman said of her time at FSW, from which she graduated in December with a degree in elementary education. “I feel that put me ahead of some other schools. You could see what works and what doesn’t.”

Because of her classroom experience, Guzman is no stranger to speaking to groups. But usually, she’s talking to 17 students, not a couple of thousand people.

“I’m just going into it like it’s one, giant classroom,” she said, prior to her speech.

Like Guzman, the graduating Nicole Smith also has real-world experience.

Smith, 38 and originally from Washington, D.C., moved to Lee County in 1998, attending Estero High for the last two months of high school. She graduated from FSW for the first time in 2008, when it was known as Edison College and held the ceremony at Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall. She graduated then with a degree in respiratory care. She left Friday with a degree in cardiopulmonary science.

Smith has worked at Health Park Medical Center. She also works for FSW as a clinical associate and even helped one of her professors by writing a chapter for a medical textbook, published in March.

“I love it,” Smith said of FSW. “It’s come along way from its days as Edison College. Sports, student activities, the arena.”

Smith said she too has come a long way. She credited faculty members Sindee Karpel and Jean Newberry with mentoring and motivating her.

“When I first started, I was a little bit of a problem child,” said Smith, who hopes to get a master’s degree in health care administration from LSU. “They helped me realize that I’m worth it, and I can do anything.”

Like Smith, Ricardo Ortega, 20, graduated with cum laude honors, meaning a grade point average above 3.5.

Ortega also has a real-world job, working for Suncoast Credit Union as a loan officer. Born in Mexico City, the temporary U.S. resident became the first member of his family to earn a college degree. His parents, Cornelio and Araceli Ortega, just didn’t have the means, he said. He hopes to inspire his sister, Lucia, 7, to seek higher education as well.

“I was able to escape that path thanks to the opportunities that this country gives,” Ortega said. His father is an electrician. “This country is full of opportunities for us to be able to work and for me to continue my education.”

Fitzpatrick, who moved to Fort Myers two years ago with her mom after graduating from Trumball High School in Connecticut, graduated with an accounting degree.

“I’ll be transferring to FGCU in the fall to get my master’s in business and human resources,” she said. “I changed my major a bit. I want to interact more with people.

“While I was at FSW, I was part of a peer mentor team. That helps students with their introduction to college life. It’s called the cornerstone experience class. I realized I loved helping people. I do have a speech prepared. I’m going to be talking about transformation and how FSW has helped my transformation from someone who was quite shy to someone who wants to be a part of a team.”

As Guzman took the podium for her speech, she read from a prepared script on her phone. She weaved into it the theme of technology. But she imparted a message that in the end, you can only rely on technology so much.

“As I began to write this very speech, I did what most college students do,” she told the audience. “go to Google….

“What I soon realized was, you can Google for an answer. You can Google for a career. You can even Google for a strange rash that suddenly appears and then you soon find out you’re going to die tomorrow. Or not.

“Yet what you can’t Google is what is found in your heart. The passion that lifts you and gets you up every morning.”

The moisture will surge from the trough (a low-pressure system in the upper levels of the atmosphere) developing heavier showers and scattered thunderstorms through the evening.

The winds will be from the southeast, and it will still feel muggy and warm tonight. Low temperatures will remain in the low 70s, and for some areas to the south of Orlando, temperatures will stay in the mid-70s and muggy.

Check the water temperatures

Winds along the east central coast of Florida

Expect the moisture to stay put over Central Florida through Friday, producing the chance for scattered showers and isolated storms through the afternoon. Showers on Friday afternoon will move mainly from the southwest to the northeast. Storms will likely affect the coast Friday afternoon.

There is a high risk for rip currents along our east coast beaches, make sure to swim near a lifeguard, if you must go in the water.

RAINFALL FORECAST

Generally, throughout Central Florida, rainfall could range between half to one inch. Higher isolated amounts south of Orlando and toward the Space Coast. Some places inland where heavier showers and storm become more persistent could have amounts close to one inch and a half thorugh Friday afternoon.

WEEKEND FORECAST

The National Hurricane Center continues to give this area of disturbed weather a 20 percent chance of developing once it parallels Georgia and the Carolinas. It will remain over the Western Atlantic and a cold front will keep it over sea by late this weekend.

At this point, it would not represent a danger to Florida, as it will be moving north and then out to the open Atlantic.

The front is currently scheduled to reach Florida early next week, but it seems to become stationary over Central Florida. Depending on strength, it could mean scattered showers Monday and Tuesday. We will continue to monitor the evolution of this next front and update you on TV, online and our WFTV Weather app.

For Central Florida, there is a low chance for scattered storms, mainly in the afternoon this weekend. The winds will be from the south Saturday and from the southwest Sunday. Due to the wind direction Sunday, the temperatures will likely reach the 90s.

61,Look for rainy Friday along Florida's east coast from early season tropical disturbance,"Prepare for a rainy Friday as a tropical low pressure area moves over Florida's east coast. It's unlikely the stormy weather will mean an early start to the 2019 hurricane season, but weather forecasters are watching it closely.

Rain chances overnight Thursday and Friday are 60 percent, said the National Weather Service office in Melbourne.

The National Hurricane Center puts the chance of tropical storm formation at low — less than 10 percent — over the next five days. The low pressure trough ""extends from South Florida northeastward across the western Atlantic for a few hundred miles,"" the Hurricane Center said Thursday morning. The system is forecast to move northeastward over the southeastern United States coast through the next couple of days.

Rain chances are 30 percent on Saturday and 50% on Sunday, with highs in the high 80s. Rip currents are expected along local beaches as the surf builds in response to the low pressure area.

63,12-year-old Florida girl hopes to save lives with car seat invention,"UMATILLA — A Umatilla Middle School student who won first place at the state science fair in March is now pursuing a patent for her life-saving technology.

Seventh-grader Alexandra “Lexie” Clow won $750 in prize money after her project, called the pediatric heat stroke prevention device, earned her a spot in the international BroadCom competition in Washington D.C. She’s also won awards at the Lockheed Martin Science Challenge in Orlando, netting her an additional $400.

“I haven’t spent a cent of the money I’ve won,” Lexie said. “I want to put it all toward the patent.”

The patent would protect the core mechanics of her device, a car seat designed to alert people when a baby has been left in a hot car, as she continues to promote and develop it.

Lexie and her family decided a couple months ago to pursue the patent as she prepared to go to the state science fair for her second year of competition.

“We thought, hey, let’s help her get a patent on this,” father Rick Clow said. “It’s not really a big deal.”

As they came to find out, it was a bigger deal than they expected.

You might think the patent process is inexpensive and simple, but Rick Clow said the U.S. Patent Office has become the domain of lawyers more than the average person.

Companies have lawyers to handle the process, but individuals have to seek out specialized attorneys.

In the meantime, the family has registered Lexie's project as patent pending, which Clow said was a simple and accessible first step.

To get the rest of the way, the family has started a GoFundMe campaign describing the project and asking for $15,000 to navigate the patent process.

Currently, the GoFundMe is sitting at $1,410. One $100 donation came from the Lake County Sheriff’s Office, which also gave Lexie a signal boost for her project after she won the science fair.

Lexie hopes to secure the patent prior to the international science fair in October, where it will go before an international audience.

She also wants the patent so she can take the device to the next level of development. Currently, the device works with a mostly wired system and a few radio frequency transmitters.

It's an independently powered car seat that gets hooked into a car's electronics in order to turn on the lights and honk the horn when it detects the weight of a baby and heat around 104 degrees Fahrenheit. It activates cooling fans to increase a baby's chances of surviving, and the seat also has bright blue LEDs on the side to draw the eye straight toward the seat.

Lexie said she hopes it can be developed as an accessory to smarter cars, with an app to alert parents who are walking away from their car without their child because, yes, it happens.

Ideally, it would even be a part of the car, rather than a standalone seat, she said.

Lexie said her goal was to keep the technology affordable. She used cheap, easily accessible components so it could be replicated for just a few hundred dollars.

""I want to fix something that's a problem locally for us,"" Lexie said. When she found out Florida had the second most pediatric heat stroke deaths in the U.S., she decided it was a preventable problem and she wanted to solve it.

58 children died of heat stroke in 2018, she said, one of which occurred in Sanford. Lexie thinks she can help lower that number.

Help Lexie on her journey for a patent!

Hideout professional Justin Bertsch is heading to Bethpage Black in a couple of weeks for the PGA Championship. And Royal Poinciana's Andrew Filbert will be joining him.

Naples' Bertsch shot a final-round even-par 72 to tie for 13th at the PGA Professional Championship in Bluffton, South Carolina, on Wednesday. Bertsch shot 73-69-74-72 for a 288 total. The top 20 qualified for the PGA Championship, which is May 16-19.

It will be the first PGA Championship appearance for both Bertsch and Filbert.

In March, Bertsch won a playoff to qualify for the PGA Tour's Corales Puntacana Resort and Club Championship. He missed the cut.

It appeared Filbert was going to come painstakingly close from joining Bertsch. It looked like Filbert was going to tie for 21st after bogeying the final hole.

""I had opportunities coming in,"" said Filbert, who then watched the rest of the final groups come in, waiting to see if he'd have a chance.

Matt Lohmeyer, playing in one of the final few groups, had two holes left, was tied for 19th and preventing a playoff, but finished with a pair of double-bogeys, allowing Filbert and five others into a playoff for the final two spots.

""I realized I had a chance to go earn a spot,"" he said.

Filbert had 55 yards into the short par-4 No. 11, the first playoff hole, knocked it to 8 feet and made it. Filbert, who left Bonita National for Royal Poinciana in October, was interviewed by the Golf Channel and then went and hugged his wife.

""I didn't see that coming,"" Filbert, 31, said of the booming drive. ""I hit a good lob wedge in there from about 55 yards. I hit it a little farther than I wanted, but it was able to come off the slope. Then I got a good read and just ran it in.

""It's starting to sink in a little bit, but it really well when I start booking plane tickets and making hotel reservations. The only time I've seen that course is on a video game.""

66,Budget chiefs finalize Florida's spending plan,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - House and Senate budget chiefs agreed to a roughly $90 billion budget deal that was expected to be printed late Tuesday, clearing the way for the 2019 legislative session to end later this week.

The package exceeds Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call for environmental spending, steers all public construction maintenance funding to charter schools, and boosts wages for individuals who take care of developmentally disabled adults.

Earlier in the day, Senate President Bill Galvano said the goal remains to conclude the legislative session on time Friday. But he acknowledged the session could last a day longer, because of a mandatory, 72-hour “cooling off” period before lawmakers can vote on the budget.

“We’ll be finished by the end of this week one way or another,” Galvano said.

House Appropriations Chairman Travis Cummings, a Fleming Island Republican, and his Senate counterpart, Rob Bradley, have spent days hammering out differences between the two chambers’ spending plans. The budget writers also took into consideration suggestions from Gov. Ron DeSantis, Cummings told reporters after he and Bradley met late Tuesday evening.

“There was a good balance that took place that not only offered constraint but met some of the critical needs of the state of Florida,” Cummings said.

When asked the total amount of the spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1, Cummings said it’s been “a fast and furious couple of days.”

""I can’t even tell you kind of where we ended up,"" he said.

Money for school construction has been one of the most contentious areas of the budget.

As part of a final budget deal, the House and Senate agreed to give charter schools $158.2 million to maintain, repair and remodel their buildings while deciding to give traditional public schools, state universities and colleges no money for that purpose.

Cummings and Bradley defended that decision, pointing to a $248 per-pupil increase for K-12 students and other school funding.

“This was a big year for traditional public schools,” Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said. “I think that our traditional public schools and those parents and students who choose to make different choices in their educational opportunities are all winners in this year’s budget.”

The final budget deal sets aside $280.4 million for public education capital outlay, or PECO, projects, including the $158 million lawmakers earmarked for charter school building maintenance and repairs. Legislators also settled on $76 million for higher-education construction projects, including $25 million for a University of Florida Data Science and Information Technology building. And they agreed to give $1.5 million in recurring funds to the Department of Education to develop a two-year workforce program that would assist individuals aged 22 or older to get a high school diploma and career technical skills.

House and Senate budget writers also approved $250,000 for Florida Department of Education “litigation expenses.”

Cummings acknowledged that money will likely be needed to defend a new voucher program which would allow a maximum of 18,000 students to use taxpayer-funded scholarships for tuition at private-schools, which often include religious schools. The Florida Supreme Court in 2006 struck down a similar program.

“We think we have bold legislation, particularly in the school choice area, that we greatly support, and resources are needed in this very litigious society that we are in,” Cummings said.

In an unusual move, meanwhile, lawmakers agreed to change the law to allow a lieutenant governor “who permanently resides outside Leon County to have an appropriate facility as an official headquarters.”

The agreement allows Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, a former state representative from Miami-Dade County, to receive a subsistence and travel allowance for days spent at the Capitol.

Bradley said the funding was requested by the governor’s office.

“She’s got a family and we want some flexibility for that situation,” Bradley said Monday, referring to Nuñez. “It was a request and we accommodated the request.”

In environmental spending, the budget will top by $60 million DeSantis’ $628.6 million request for Lake Okeechobee and other water projects.

The budget includes $322.6 million for Lake Okeechobee restoration and $100 million for Florida springs. Bradley said the budget also includes $33 million in new funds for the Florida Forever land preservation program, down from $100 million in current spending.

Bradley said more than $100 million will be available for Florida Forever because there will be money left over at the end of the current fiscal year, which ends June 30.

“They haven’t even spent all that money yet,” Bradley said of the current year’s funding. “They aren’t close to spending all that money yet. And so we’re not going to just put things in the budget just for show. The executive and the Cabinet need to demonstrate that they’re going to move those dollars out that we’re providing.”

The fiscal plan also includes $90 million for a tax relief package.

Other than lifting sales taxes during “holiday” periods on back-to-school items and for hurricane season supplies, the details have yet to be settled. The Senate is expected to take up the House proposal (HB 7123) on Wednesday.

In health care funding, Cummings said the Agency for Persons with Disabilities was given a lot of attention this year.

Lawmakers agreed to provide more than $28 million to increase wages paid to people who care for adults with developmental disabilities. Increasing the payments was a priority for the Florida Senate, but was not included in the House’s initial budget proposal.

“Those employees in those (residential) facilities, they don’t have a lobbyist. There’s not a special interest group. These are folks who are taking care of some of our most sick and vulnerable in the state of Florida. And they are not making a lot of money at all, and the House and Senate committed to raising their standard of living because we appreciate the things they do,” Bradley said.

The Legislature also agreed to allow the Agency for Persons with Disabilities to work in conjunction with the state Agency for Health Care Administration to develop a plan to redesign the I-budget. Though it’s a Medicaid program, the I-budget is one of the few that is administered outside of the statewide mandatory Medicaid managed-care program.

After a challenging couple of years, library patrons in North Fort Myers and Bonita Springs can expect to finally see their much-anticipated new public libraries open in the summer.

The libraries will be located at the North Fort Myers Community Park and in downtown Bonita Springs.

The buildings will take their place among modern libraries, serving as more than a repository for books. Electronic access, internet access and connections to material stored far away will be at hand. New spaces for quiet research, public meetings and group interaction also will be included.

Library users have been in make-do mode for a few years.

Demolishing the old North Fort Myers building meant a temporary operation set up in a Pine Island Road strip mall, a storefront leased by the county for $3,000 a month, with limited parking.

North Fort Myers patrons eagerly anticipate their new library.

""I can't wait,"" said resident Larry Filbert, who visits the library every few days to pick up and return books for his wife. ""She reads a new book every other day.""

Sandy Filbert makes her selections at home and calls to reserve her next book. Her husband waits for an inter-library transfer and picks it up.

""I can't wait for it to open,"" Filbert said of the new facility. ""Sometimes I come in here and I can't even find a parking space.""

Relief for the parking issue is part of the plans for the new libraries.

The new libraries will have a lot more parking closer to the building than their predecessors.

In 2014, when a central library opened in downtown Fort Myers, parking became a big issue, and not one Lee County has forgotten.

Open space nearest the First Street building was used for plazas, to capture an urban feel. But older patrons did not appreciate the walk.

Some even had to park a mile away, at the Publix Super Market on McGregor Boulevard, and took the trolley shuttle to the door.

County commissioners ordered staff to make parking close to the building a priority.

The 37-year-old Bonita library on Pine Street remained in use during construction.

But then came Hurricane Irma, which flooded the building, shuttering it for about three months.

Revitalized communities

Library buildings in both communities are seen as optimistic signs of community development.

When the new libraries open toward mid-summer, they will reflect designs crafted with input from the community.

The North Fort Myers site, on the U.S. 41 Business, is a show of vitality in an area that saw more than its share of recession-induced business failures.

In Bonita, the library is part of a downtown district reconceived and rebuilt in an $18 million project funded by the city and the county.

Extensive negotiations between governments focused on Bonita's desire to move the library to its revitalized downtown.

""If we don't show, governmentally, that we're confident in the downtown and that we will invest in the community, why should we expect anyone else to?"" former Mayor Ben Nelson Jr. said last week. ""That's the big message there.""

Construction costs for the two projects have risen.

The budget for the North Fort Myers library, approved by county commissioners in 2016, started at $12.5 million. The cost is now $15.3 million, according to documents provided to the commission.

A good part of the increase is due to a change to the roof that cost an additional $430,000.

Another $205,000 was added so each building can shelter emergency crews during a major storm. It's a lesson from Irma, intended to decentralize location of crews to improve post-storm response.

Last week, commissioners approved $154,000 to cover installation costs for the redesigned roof, a bus stop shelter to bring LeeTran to the site, landscaping improvements and easier access for county utilities.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is awaiting retaliation from China over increased tariffs, after talks in Washington ended without a deal on trade, the president’s chief economic adviser said on Sunday.

“The expected countermeasures have not yet materialized. We may know more today or even this evening or tomorrow,” Larry Kudlow told “Fox News Sunday.” Kudlow also said that President Donald Trump’s plan to raise US tariffs on Chinese goods across the board could take months to take effect.

“Call it a couple of months. Call it three months. I don’t know. That will take some time and then of course the president’s going to have to make the final decision on that,” Kudlow said.

The United States began raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports from 10% to 25% on Friday after American officials accused Beijing of backtracking on commitments made in earlier rounds of negotiations.

Talks in Washington broke off on Friday without a deal on trade, but both sides have indicated that future talks are likely.

“I think that China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election, 2020, to see if they could get lucky & have a Democrat win,” Trump tweeted Saturday.

Beijing retaliated for previous tariff hikes by raising duties on $110 billion of American imports. And officials have targeted American companies operating in China by slowing customs clearance and stepping up regulatory scrutiny.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that he advised the president to finalize a trade deal with China soon, “because the longer we’re involved in a tariff battle or a trade war, the better chance there is that we could actually enter into a recession because of it.”

The two countries are sparring over U.S. allegations that China steals technology and pressures American companies into handing over trade secrets, part of an aggressive campaign to turn Chinese companies into world leaders in robotics, electric cars and other advanced industries.",http://www.wfla.com/news/politics/white-house-expects-china-to-retaliate-over-trade-tariffs/1997528838,2019-05-12T14:48:37Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

80,'Champion mom': Tallahassee triplets bring joy after journey through failed pregnancies,"CLOSE New mom to triplets shares her pregnancy journey as she gets to celebrate her first Mother's Day as a mom. Alicia Devine, Tallahassee Democrat

This Mother's Day, Megan Walker will celebrate after a journey of thinking she'd never be able to have kids.

Megan Walker thought she’d never be able to have a baby.

She and her husband Bo Walker dreamed of becoming parents. When they started dating at North Florida Christian High School, the Tallahassee couple created lists of favorite baby names.

The pair tried for close to three years and had three failed procedures. In July 2017, Megan had an ectopic pregnancy, which is a fertilization that occurs outside the uterus.

A year later, the couple came back from the in-vitro fertilization of two embryos with high hopes it was going to work.

It came back negative. Megan was devastated. For the healthy young couple, doctors couldn’t find a reason for the mishaps.

Finally, in August, they tried IVF again. This time, Megan and Bo weren’t told they were going to have a baby — they were going to have three.

“At first we were a little bit scared,” Megan said. “Then we were like, 'We’ve got this.' We would rather have more babies than no babies at all.”

The journey to that moment was a risky one. Mentally, Megan and Bo were preparing for the worst.

Doctors feared a condition in which one of the twins would take more nutrients than the other, Megan said. And toward the end of the pregnancy, she developed mild pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication distinguished by high blood pressure. She was admitted to the hospital for few weeks then she went into premature labor.

Kensley, Riley and Ellie were born by C-section at 34 weeks in March — the only set of triplets born at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare since 2017, according to the hospital's communications team. Each of the girls were born under five pounds and were monitored in the NICU for just short of two weeks.

Megan recalled sobbing as she held Riley.

""It just really hit me that I had three babies because God gave me these miracles, so it was just really overwhelming,” she said. ""I was so happy.""

Bo isn’t a crier. But during a moment alone with the girls after walking family members back and forth into the NICU to see his three tiny babies, he finally shed his own tears.

“We say we lost three, but we got three,” he said. “We’ve both always worked with kids and that was kind of part of our story. We both love kids and work with kids, and we had a hard time having our own.”

Bo, 27, is a full-time pastor at Generations Church, and Megan, 28, has worked at a preschool for the past decade.

“I didn’t feel like I was ever going to get to be a mom, so finally I was – to three beautiful babies that had already graduated the NICU before they were even two weeks old,” she said.

On Tuesday, their three girls were bundled in shimmering gold hair bows and matching onesies that read: best – friends – forever.

A stickler for planning, Megan had been directing set-up for the babies from her hospital bed pre-labor by web cam, pointing her husband and mom around the house.

On a shelf in the living room, a painted block reminds the young parents: “Today’s Goal: Keep the tiny humans alive.” On the other side, a photo of the new family is clipped onto a board that reads: “Embrace the chaos and love your crazies.”

Megan’s taking it one day at a time.

“She’s a champion mom,” Bo said. “I get home like — how do you do this by yourself all day?”

The answer? Routine.

The babies go through about 24 diapers a day and more than 20 bottles a day.

“I have a system of how I make them all happy at once. They all eat 30 minutes apart,” she said. “I start with Kensley, and normally I know that Riley and Ellie need to be in a Boppy right next to me because they’re going to get upset. As soon as one leaves from where they are, the other two automatically know and start to get fussy.”

A closet is decked with tiny clothes, stacks of bibs and large boxes of Pampers.

Kensley is a feminine alternative of Bo’s middle name, Kenneth; Ellie is a favorite name the high-school sweethearts have planned since their teen years, and Riley rhymed.

At the baby shower, Megan and Bo surprised friends and family with the triple good news by shooting three pink fireworks one after another.

With three dogs as well as her new triplets, one might think Megan’s got her hands too full to think of having more kids. But she considers her family medium-sized.

“We could have a few more,” she laughed. “Maybe just like, one or two more.”

82,Auburndale couple on quest to adopt 'Baby Parker',"Christine Parker: “We're blessed with a lot of nieces and nephews, but it's in the back of your head, like, 'Am I ever going to be a mom?' ”

AUBURNDALE — For about a decade, Mother's Day has left Christine Parker feeling a bit empty.

The Auburndale resident is happy to honor her mother and the mother of her husband, Chris. As she gathers with relatives, she also pays tribute to in-laws and basks in the affection of their many children.

Yet Parker, 32, remains unfulfilled in her long-held desire to be a mother.

“It's really hard to see, 'Hey, here's your Mother's Day rose,' and I'm just sitting there like —” Parker said, making a pouty face. “We're blessed with a lot of nieces and nephews, but it's in the back of your head, like, 'Am I ever going to be a mom?' ”

The Parkers have known since before they married nearly a decade ago that they would be unable to have children of their own. After waiting to attain stability in their careers and finances, late last year they began exploring the idea of adoption, seeking an infant under 1 year old.

The couple is now dealing with the reality that becoming parents means raising a considerable sum of money. By using a private adoption agency, they say the process could cost $40,000 or more.

The Parkers created a Facebook page with the name Operation Find Baby Parker, and they have held yard sales and other efforts to generate money. But it's not clear if they will gather the needed funds in time to have a baby in their nursery for Mother's Day of 2020.

“We talked about it, and we knew it wasn't going to happen overnight,” Christine Parker said. “We thought probably the time frame — we were hoping in probably a year.”

Her husband added: “It'll probably take two.”

The couple said they have raised about $5,000 so far.

Delaying parenthood

Chris Parker, 36, said a doctor told him at around age 14 that he would be unable to father children. That was a result of heavy doses of medication, including steroids, that he received as a child to treat asthma and other health problems.

The couple, both Polk County natives, began dating about 15 years ago. Christine Parker said her husband informed her long before they were married that biological children would not be an option.

The Parkers delayed pursuing adoption as Christine completed her college degree and got established in her job as a teacher, now at Caldwell Elementary School. After that, the couple wanted to wait until they bought a house, a pursuit they completed last year.

Christine Parker said she has always had an affinity for children and decided as a girl that she wanted to become a teacher. She started babysitting as a teenager and worked in a daycare center throughout high school.

Parker said she and her husband both have a weakness for children, as evidenced by what they recognize is excessive bestowing of gifts upon Christine's godson.

“I just want to be able to have the love I see other mothers have when they hold their child or they go to their games,” she said. “I want to be able to experience that. I want to have those family moments and family vacations.”

Chris Parker, who works in a Publix food-production facility, said he has long wanted to be a father.

“I think it's pretty important to me because I've seen the love that my father and mother have given me, and I want to be able to do the same thing,” he said, “kind of teach them what I've been taught. Sort of like to live on the Parker legacy, I guess.”

Christine Parker has a brother with three children, and Chris has 15 nieces and nephews. The couple said they didn't discuss their inability to conceive children, even to most of their relatives, before going public last year.

One person who did know is Juliana Walker, Christine's best friend since they were students at Florida Southern College. Walker, also a teacher, said she was unable to get pregnant for the first years of her marriage even after undergoing fertility treatment and had all but given up on having children when she finally became pregnant in 2017.

“That was something we bonded over,” Walker said of their mutually childless years. “You want to celebrate your mom (on Mother's Day), but the feeling of, 'Well, that's not me and I don't get to celebrate that,' that's a hard thing to face. I remember many Mother's Days we would call each other and just talk about it.”

Christine Parker is godmother to Walker's 15-month-old son, Xander.

“Through having my son, we've continued to bond and she has seen what it's like to be able to be a mom and the joy that comes with it,” Walker said. “We talked about how great it would be if she did adopt and we could raise our kids together.”

Money shock

The Parkers began exploring private adoption agencies last year, and they said they were stunned to discover how much the process can cost.

Many factors combine to determine how much an agency charges adoptive parents, said Nicole Witt, executive director of the Adoption Consultancy in Brandon. She said those seeking to adopt must cover the prenatal costs for the pregnant woman, including medical care, legal costs, counseling and even travel costs and living expenses.

Adoption agencies also charge for home inspections, Witt said, and their fees cover overhead costs, including advertising and outreach. She said the typical cost of adopting through a private agency ranges from the low $30,000s to the high $40,000s.

“It's generally speaking not a process for people without money,” said Adam Pertman, president of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency. “The demographic of people who adopt an infant is high socio-economic status because it is expensive. Even if people are fundraising, they still have to get to that amount of money.”

Seeking to adopt a baby also involves financial risk. A pregnant woman who contracts with an adoption agency to make her baby available has the legal right to change her mind, even after giving birth. In Florida, the woman may sign a consent form to relinquish her parental rights either 48 hours after birth or after she is discharged from the hospital, but she faces no deadline for doing so.

If the woman decides to keep the baby, the prospective parents usually forfeit most of the money they have paid, Witt said. Some agencies will roll over some of their fees, she said, but payments devoted to the woman's pregnancy care can't be recovered.

“Every time we interviewed with adoption agencies, that was our first question,” Christine Parker said. “They would avoid answering it.”

Couples wishing to adopt have other options besides going through private agencies. Children in state custody are available for adoption through such nonprofits as Heartland for Children, which contracts with the Department of Children and Families in Polk, Hardee and Highlands counties.

Adopting a foster child costs “little or nothing,” DCF says in an overview on its website. The agency doesn't charge for home studies and parent training classes, and it reimburses court costs and legal fees for adoptive parents in financial need.

Launching operation

The Parkers said they considered adopting an older child in foster care but feel a strong desire to adopt a baby.

Only about 14,000 infants are voluntarily offered for adoption in the United States each year, Pertman said. Many more children in state protection or foster care are available to prospective parents. But Pertman said it's unfair to criticize parents like the Parkers for preferring to seek an infant.

He said couples who choose to have biological children could also be asked why they don't instead adopt an older foster child when so many often spent years waiting to join a permanent family.

Knowing it would take them years to save enough money to cover the adoption costs, the Parkers decided to seek help. In December, they created their Facebook page, which includes an 850-word statement that says, “We are on a journey to complete our story with our missing piece … a baby!”

The page, which has attracted more than 200 followers, includes a link that allows donations to be made through PayPal. The couple also had business cards printed with the phrase “Please help bring home Baby Parker,” along with the Facebook page address and an email address.

The Parkers chose to include a biblical verse from the book of 1 Samuel: “For this child I have prayed and the Lord has granted the desires of my heart.”

After consulting with friends and relatives, the Parkers began planning other ways of raising money toward their adoption costs.

In addition to those direct contributions, the couple has received many donations of items for the two yard sales they have held so far. As word has spread — particularly through the school system — the Parkers said people they didn't know have come forward to give them furniture, a TV, clothes, purses and toys, among other items.

Chris Parker said he rented a truck so that he and his father could drive around the county collecting all of the gifts, some of which they are keeping in two storage units. Other donated items, including a crib, a bassinet and a swing, have been installed in the couple's nursery.

The nursery is painted in neutral turquoise and gray, and the Parkers say they have no gender preference.

Unexpected support

Christine Parker has expressed her gratitude on the Facebook page for the donations.

“The support we've been getting since we made it public, we weren't even expecting that,” she said. “You have that thought, 'Nobody's going to donate,' but the outpouring of love and support we've got from not only the community but complete strangers, we are so grateful.”

As another fundraiser, the Parkers are selling pieces to a jigsaw puzzle (a symbol of their sense that a piece is missing from their lives). Buyers will write their names on the back of each piece, and the puzzle.

Witt said she has worked with many couples who needed to generate the money to cover adoption costs. She has seen prospective parents take out home-equity loans, cash-in retirement savings and receive early inheritance gifts from parents.

Witt said many couples engage in fundraising efforts similar to what the Parkers are doing — organizing yard sales, car washes, wine tastings, spaghetti dinners, run-walk events and auctions. She said others take on second jobs or rent out rooms in their homes.

Grants and other financial assistance are available from private foundations to cover at least part of the cost of adopting. The Parkers said they plan to investigate those possibilities.

When a couple seeks to adopt an infant, the dynamic is completely different than if they were choosing a foster child. It is the pregnant woman who decides which applicants to the agency she wants to receive the baby.

The Parkers recently had someone from the adoption agency conduct a home inspection, a procedure they said lasted more than four hours. Their next step will be to prepare a video that the agency will share with women planning to give their babies up for adoption.

It is a challenge for the Parkers to remain patient as they strive to gather the money they need to pay for an adoption. Walker said Christine Parker has drawn encouragement from the public response.

“I think because there's been such an overwhelming response, she can see how much people love her,” Walker said. “She just thought there wouldn't be much of a response because this is a personal issue and a lot of people always want to ask, 'Well, why don't you do this?' and 'Why don't you do that?' I try to just encourage her and show her you can clearly see this is God's plan for you because it's worked out perfectly.”

One of the items the Parkers have received is not intended for Baby Parker or for sale to generate money. It's a book, “I Wished for You: A Keepsake Adoption Journal.”

Christine Parker said she received the journal from a friend of a friend at one of the couple's yard sales. The woman arrived with her adopted son.

Parker said she will probably make the same gesture after she finds Baby Parker.

84,Metal detectors coming to Camping World Stadium,"Photo by Joe Robbins/Getty Images Photo by Joe Robbins/Getty Images

- The City of Orlando is voting Monday on approving 90 new metal detectors for Camping World Stadium.

The city will spend $317,000 from their enterprise funds to buy them, it's cash that comes from things like ticket sales, instead of taxpayer dollars. The city's venues director, Allen Johnson, said it's a good idea.

“We've never had metal detectors at the stadium, we've had hand-held wands. Metal detectors are a more efficient and effective way to get people through,” Johnson said.

In the past, when they've needed metal detectors, they've had to rent them.

“What we're doing is taking the money we used to rent them, and now buying them and we'll charge the promoters back for them. It's actually a win-win,” Johnson said.

City staff says the metal detectors will save about $76,000 every year in staffing costs. They'll also make the stadium more attractive to promoters, who often require increased security screenings at their events.

If the city approves the move, staff says the new metal detectors will be delivered in the next couple of months.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/metal-detectors-coming-to-camping-world-stadium,2019-05-11T03:49:32Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

A California judge ordered a couple to pay nearly $600,000 for uprooting a 180-year-old oak tree that later died and causing other damage to a protected property about an hour north of San Francisco.The damage was discovered in 2014, when a concerned neighbor reported heavy equipment and digging on a property protected under a conservation easement.Sonoma Land Trust Stewardship Director Bob Neale went to check and found more than 3,000 cubic yards of dirt and rock had been removed and a 180-year-old oak tree had been uprooted without permits for any of the work, the Press Democrat reported Wednesday.The heritage oak was uprooted and bound so that it could be dragged to an adjoining ranch where property owners Peter and Toni Thompson had built a new estate home. That heritage oak and two others the landowners sought to move over a haul road they bulldozed through the previously undisturbed site all died, along with a dozen more trees and other vegetation, according to court records.The damage prompted the Sonoma Land Trust to sue the Thompsons.In a judgment finalized last week, Sonoma County Superior Court Judge Patrick Broderick sided with the land trust, calling out the Thompsons for “knowing and intentional” violations of a legally binding conservation deal. He said the couple had “demonstrated an arrogance and complete disregard for the mandatory terms of the easement.”Broderick ordered the couple to pay more than $586,000 in damages toward environmental restoration and other costs.Shortly after Broderick’s ruling, the Thompsons put the protected property and a neighboring ranch on the market for $8.45 million.The couple is filing for a new trial on claims that their trial attorney could not provide proper representation amid a private family matter that arose before the court proceeding, said Richard Freeman, their new attorney.“There are so many personal tragic issues throughout this case that were very painful to deal with and actually really affected the ability to tell our side of the story,” Peter Thompson said. “In our opinion, there’s a lot of evidence that our side of the story really didn’t get a chance to explain.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/couple-ordered-to-pay-nearly-dollar600000-for-uprooting-tree/27419404,2019-05-09T14:55:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

92,"Florida lawmakers block plastic straw bans; Sanibel, Fort Myers Beach prohibitions in peril","TALLAHASSEE - The Florida Senate on Tuesday passed an environmental bill that includes prohibiting local governments from enforcing regulations on plastic straws over the next five years.

For the most part plastic straws were absent from Fort Myers Beach on Sunday, the first day of an official ban on them This couple, from Iowa, had wandered away from a Fort Myers Beach bar with mixed drinks, complete with plastic straws, a double whammy since such alcoholic drinks are not allowed to be consumed outside where they are bought. (Photo: Michael Braun/The News-Press)

On a 24-15 vote, the Senate imposed a moratorium on plastic-straw bans, the latest example of the constant tug-of-war between the Legislature and cities and counties over local regulations.

The decision to pass the bill also followed numerous failed attempts by lawmakers over the years to prevent plastic-straw bans. Currently, 10 cities across the state, including Fort Myers Beach and Sanibel, have rules governing the use of plastic straws, which have drawn environmental concerns.

The House passed the bill (HB 771) last week, meaning it is now ready to head to Gov. Ron DeSantis. If he signs the bill (HB 771), local governments would not be able to enforce any ordinance banning plastic straws until July 2024.

The vote Tuesday in the Republican-controlled Senate was largely along party lines. Democrats Lauren Book of Plantation, Randolph Bracy of Orlando and Bobby Powell of West Palm Beach crossed party lines to vote for the bill, while Republican George Gainer of Panama City opposed it.

Under the bill, the research arm of the Legislature would also be required to conduct a study of “each ordinance or regulation adopted” by local governments related to single-use plastic straws. A report of the study would need to be submitted by December to Senate President Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, and House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes.

Rather than focusing on the environmental impacts of local plastic-straw bans, the study would focus on the “data and conclusions” used in adopting local ordinances.

This has irked environmental groups, which argue that sufficient evidence already exists that plastic pollution is detrimental to the environment. When lawmakers considered the proposal in committee hearings, groups often brought up a study by the World Economic Forum that said there will be more plastic by weight than fish in oceans by 2050.

State lawmakers have also taken aim at other local regulations that were enacted to protect the environment. One of those efforts is in a bill by Sen. Travis Hutson, R-St. Augustine. That bill targets local ordinances that restrict the sale and use of sunscreens containing certain chemicals that studies have found to damage coral reefs.

The bill passed Tuesday by the Senate includes other issues along with the moratorium on plastic-straw bans. It also deals with issues related to recyclable materials.

TALLAHASSEE— Law enforcement officers could pull over motorists they see texting and driving on Florida roads, under a bill now headed to Gov. Ron DeSantis.

With a vote of 108-7, the House on Monday passed a compromise measure (HB 107) that blends a ban on texting and driving with a requirement that motorists travel hands-free of wireless devices in school zones and work zones.

Sen. Wilton Simpson, a Trilby Republican behind the Senate effort, had sought to make the hands-free requirement statewide. Simpson is slated to take over as Senate president following the 2020 elections.

More: House backs tougher texting, driving ban

The House’s passage of the bill Monday came after the Senate approved a series of health-care measures sought by House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes.

If signed into law, texting while driving would be a “primary” traffic offense. Currently, police can only cite motorists for texting behind the wheel if they are pulled over for other reasons. By making it a primary offense, police could pull over motorists solely for texting while driving.

Oliva, a Miami Republican, credited the Senate's willingness to compromise for the advancement of the proposal, which proponents have sought for years.

“I think as you saw there was some amendments put on regarding school zones and construction areas where workers are present and a couple of smaller fixes,” Oliva told reporters following Monday’s floor session.

Last week, DeSantis said he supported the House’s efforts to make texting while driving a primary traffic offense.

“This stuff has got to be enforceable,” the governor said Wednesday. “If it’s a primary offense, then people are going to get pulled over. So, you’ve got to make sure that is going to happen. The more you go beyond texting, I just have concerns about the administrability of it.”

Rep. Emily Slosberg, a Boca Raton Democrat who co-sponsored the House bill with Tampa Republican Jackie Toledo, said the state is catching up with the rest of the nation. Slosberg said the goal is to get Florida fully hands-free.

“It means Florida’s roads are finally going to be safer. It’s huge,” Slosberg told The News Service of Florida following the bill’s passage. “This means the safety of Florida’s citizens, Florida’s drivers, and especially Florida’s children, by adding the extra protections in school zones.”

Slosberg, who has followed her father, former Rep. Irv Slosberg, in pushing for traffic-safety changes in the Legislature, called the vote “surreal.”

Emily Slosberg’s twin sister, Dori, was killed in 1996 when a speeding car in which they were passengers struck a median and crashed into an oncoming vehicle.

Toledo said the “blending” of the bills “will make our bill much better.”

Under the bill, changes would be phased in, with ticketing beginning Jan. 1.

From Oct. 1 through the end of the year, only verbal and written warnings would be issued to people stopped for texting while driving.

As part of Simpson’s proposal, county clerks of court would be able to dismiss cases of first-time offenders when violators buy wireless communications devices that can be used hands-free.

Making texting while driving a primary offense has raised concerns among numerous black and Hispanic lawmakers, who fear it would lead to increased racial profiling of minority motorists. Similar concerns helped derail previous attempts to make texting while driving a primary offense.

To address concerns about racial profiling, the bill headed to DeSantis would require officers to record the race and ethnicity of violators, with annual reports of statewide arrests submitted to the governor, Senate president and House speaker starting Feb. 1, 2020.

95,More states joining Florida to knock air out of festive balloon launches,"- The tradition of releasing balloons at weddings, birthdays and memorials may soon get deflated by lawmakers in more than half a dozen states.

Critics say the helium-filled balloons pollute the environment, and threaten birds and other wildlife when they fall to earth. In Florida, if tenor more balloons are released at once, it could lead to a $250 fine. Law enforcement can only act on those infractions if they are reported.

""People don't really realize that it's littering. That's why we want to bring attention to this,"" said state Rep. Lydia Blume, who's supporting a balloon bill in Maine. ""It's a common sense thing.""

Earlier last week, a baby dolphin was euthanized. Biologists said the found two plastic bags and a shredded balloon during a necropsy.

""This finding highlights the need to reduce single use plastic and to not release balloons into the environment,"" explained the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in a Facebook post.

Continue reading below

Nationwide, there's a growing awareness of the problem, and it has energized legislation in state governments. Bills to limit the intentional release of large numbers of balloons are being aired in legislatures in Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, in addition to Maine, said Jennifer Schultz of the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Texas is also considering a study on windblown and waterborne litter that would include helium balloons, she said. A similar proposal was terminated while in committee in the Kentucky legislature last month.

These states would join California, Connecticut, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia - all of which already have laws that ban or restrict launches. California's law applies only to foil balloons, while Connecticut is currently considering a stricter law, said Danielle Vosburgh, a Florida environmental activist who helped launch a nonprofit organization, Balloons Blow.

Maine's proposal to ban mass balloon releases took flight at a town meeting last month in Unity. Penny Sampson, chairwoman of the Select Board, said she had witnessed a couple releases in person. Once was in 2000 when triplet boys died in a fire in Unity. Another time, balloons were released at the Wiscasset Raceway to memorialize someone who died.

""To pollute the environment and cause marine and wildlife issues is really not a good way to memorialize someone. There are plenty of other ways to do it,"" Sampson said.

Critics are having some recent success in battling the feel-good tradition of releasing balloons. Clemson University stopped releasing balloons at its football games. The Indianapolis 500 and the Nebraska Cornhuskers have faced pressure to do the same.

And a growing number of communities are tackling the issue, too.

The New Jersey-based Balloon Council, which represents manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers, used to be opposed to bans on balloon releases because of the impact on small businesses. These days, the council still prefers education over legislation, but it is not opposing any of the legislative efforts to stop balloon releases.

""The balloon council feels that all balloons should be deflated and properly disposed of,"" said spokeswoman Lorna O'Hara. ""There is a heightened attention across the globe. We're rising to what's happening in the United States and globally.""

Some folks are getting the message - with or without legislative intervention.

At Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, officials at the Army installation quickly decreed there will be no more balloon releases after children released balloons on April 1 to mark the ""month of the military child."" The balloon launch caused an uproar in the community.

96,More states aim to join Florida to knock air out of festive balloon launches,"- The tradition of releasing balloons at weddings, birthdays and memorials may soon get deflated by lawmakers in more than half a dozen states.

Critics say the helium-filled balloons pollute the environment, and threaten birds and other wildlife when they fall to earth. In Florida, if ten or more balloons are released at once, it could lead to a $250 fine.

""People don't really realize that it's littering. That's why we want to bring attention to this,"" said state Rep. Lydia Blume, who's supporting a balloon bill in Maine. ""It's a common sense thing.""

Earlier last week, a baby dolphin was euthanized. Biologists said the found two plastic bags and a shredded balloon during a necropsy.

""This finding highlights the need to reduce single use plastic and to not release balloons into the environment,"" explained the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in a Facebook post.

Nationwide, there's a growing awareness of the problem, and it has energized legislation in state governments. Bills to limit the intentional release of large numbers of balloons are being aired in legislatures in Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, in addition to Maine, said Jennifer Schultz of the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Texas is also considering a study on windblown and waterborne litter that would include helium balloons, she said. A similar proposal was terminated while in committee in the Kentucky legislature last month.

These states would join California, Connecticut, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia - all of which already have laws that ban or restrict launches. California's law applies only to foil balloons, while Connecticut is currently considering a stricter law, said Danielle Vosburgh, a Florida environmental activist who helped launch a nonprofit organization, Balloons Blow.

Maine's proposal to ban mass balloon releases took flight at a town meeting last month in Unity. Penny Sampson, chairwoman of the Select Board, said she had witnessed a couple releases in person. Once was in 2000 when triplet boys died in a fire in Unity. Another time, balloons were released at the Wiscasset Raceway to memorialize someone who died.

""To pollute the environment and cause marine and wildlife issues is really not a good way to memorialize someone. There are plenty of other ways to do it,"" Sampson said.

Critics are having some recent success in battling the feel-good tradition of releasing balloons. Clemson University stopped releasing balloons at its football games. The Indianapolis 500 and the Nebraska Cornhuskers have faced pressure to do the same.

And a growing number of communities are tackling the issue, too.

The New Jersey-based Balloon Council, which represents manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers, used to be opposed to bans on balloon releases because of the impact on small businesses. These days, the council still prefers education over legislation, but it is not opposing any of the legislative efforts to stop balloon releases.

""The balloon council feels that all balloons should be deflated and properly disposed of,"" said spokeswoman Lorna O'Hara. ""There is a heightened attention across the globe. We're rising to what's happening in the United States and globally.""

Some folks are getting the message - with or without legislative intervention.

At Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, officials at the Army installation quickly decreed there will be no more balloon releases after children released balloons on April 1 to mark the ""month of the military child."" The balloon launch caused an uproar in the community.

""We've been beaten up on social media,"" said base spokesman Jeffrey Wingo.

But the outrage sparked a discussion about environmental stewardship. ""Is this the right thing to do? Is this environmentally sound, or not?"" he said. ""It is not.""

97,Marco Rubio says hackers infiltrated Florida county elections system,"Related Headlines State denies election hacking after Mueller report

- Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Friday that hackers infiltrated a Florida county’s elections system in 2016 and were “in a position” to alter voter roll data, though they don’t appear to have done so.

The senator’s comments come in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report that revealed that the Russian military intelligence unit known as the GRU sent malicious viruses to the Florida county government officials who were overseeing the 2016 election.

Rubio told the New York Times that, even though there was a hacking attack against a county’s elections system, he believes the target or targets weren’t warned about it and instead a broad basic warning was issued about possible hacking efforts.

“Everybody has been told what it is they need to do to protect themselves from the intrusion,” Rubio said. “I don’t believe the specific victims of the intrusion have been notified. The concern was that in a number of counties across the country, there are a couple of people with the attitude of: ‘We’ve got this; we don’t need your help. We don’t think we need to do what you are telling us we need to do.’”

He added that the Russian hackers were “in a position” to alter voter roll data, though he notes that they don’t appear to have taken such action.

“My biggest concern is that on Election Day you go vote and have mass confusion because voter registration information has been deleted from the systems,” the senator added.

It still remains unclear in which exact county the hackers were able to access, a frustration voiced by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who criticized federal authorities for lack of transparency, according to the Hill.

“They won’t tell us which county it was, are you kidding me?” he said at a Thursday press conference. “Why would you have not said something immediately?”

105,"Amid hardship season, Gulf Breeze baseball team gets uplifting district title win","CLOSE WATCH: Gulf Breeze baseball wins District 1-6A title Bill Vilona, Pensacola News Journal

The heavy hearts Gulf Breeze High’s baseball team carried all season made hoisting a district championship trophy an unforgettable memory.

The Dolphins, who dealt with the tragic death of senior pitcher Connor Wood in March, erupted with joy Friday after their stunning 5-1 victory against West Florida High in the District 1-6A Tournament title game at the WFHS Marc Conti Baseball Complex.

“We did it for 16 (Wood’s number),” said senior pitcher Chris Halstead, who was sensational Friday in a complete-game performance. He also drove in two runs in the five run, fifth-inning rally.

“Because, it’s been kind of a tough year,” said Halstead, softly, as his voice indicated the emotion. “And this really means a lot.”

All of it showed in the way the Dolphins reacted and embraced each other once the final out was recorded in the seventh inning.

“This is just a testament to these kids. They stuck together through everything that happened,” said Dolphins’ third-year coach Kevin Ricks, a former long-time Pace Patriots assistant on former coach Charlie Warner’s staff. “Connor’s death…. they came together.

“They had him in their minds and in their hearts the whole year. We struggled after that for awhile. They were determined they were going to continue to work and play for the group, but also for Connor… and it is just phenomenal to see.”

His team will host Wakulla High on Wednesday in Gulf Breeze for the first round of the state Class 6A playoffs. West Florida will travel to Panama City to again face Mosley, a familiar post-season foe.

The district title was the second in three years for Gulf Breeze, which had not celebrated such a feat for the previous 35 seasons. But this one happened after unspeakable adversity.

The Dolphins (11-14) lost Wood on March 24. Two days later, they played a game with his jersey in the dugout for memory. They’ve worn his number on their ballcaps and wristbands.

But the emotional toll may have affected the end of the season when Gulf Breeze lost six of its last seven games. The Dolphins then pulled off a 4-0 win against Fort Walton Beach High Tuesday in the first round of the district tournament at Choctaw High.

With West Florida winning the other side of the bracket, Choctaw graciously allowed the higher-seed Jaguars (17-8) to host the championship game to ease travel. Thursday’s game was wiped out by the rain and moved to 5 p.m. Friday.

“We had that winning mentality before the game even started,” Halstead said. “All they told me was to throw strikes and they’ll back me up. (Coaches and teammates) told me that we’re going to get hits and we’re going to win the ballgame.”

Through four innings, the game was scoreless. West Florida starter Chase Stanhope had twice worked his way out of jams, including a bases-loaded situation. He had stranded four runners in scoring position.

But after one out in the fifth, the Dolphins strung together a couple singles, loaded the bases on a walk, then took advantage of two throwing errors on ground ball plays to ignite the rally. Halstead’s two-run single was the biggest RBI hit.

“It was a game where once somebody broke the ice, then the water starts pouring in, and that’s what happened,” said Jaguars coach Marc Conti. “We had plenty of opportunities to score, we just didn’t hit the ball. (Gulf Breeze) hit it at good times and made all the plays. They won it.

“But like I told Kevin (Ricks), ‘I am really happy for you. What you have been through this year, it may be what y’all needed.’ Maybe this will help the healing process.”

The teams split their regular-season meetings. Wood was the winning pitcher in Gulf Breeze’s 2-0 win March 14. The Jaguars won 8-4 the next day. They would meet for a fourth time if both teams win Wednesday.

“I’d like for us to play again,” Conti said.

The Jaguars had baserunners, but few prime scoring chances against until the sixth inning when the first two batters reached. They got a run, but left two more runners on base.

Halstead, a righthander had convinced Ricks a year ago to let him try his hand on the mound.

“He has always been in my ear about doing it,” Ricks said. “He would say, ‘Coach I can throw strikes, I can throw strikes. I’m not going to throw hard, I don’t have a lot of pitches, but I can throw my fastball for a strike.’

“So we gave him a shot last year and he was right. He gives you a chance, because you know he’s not going to hurt himself. He has really come on in the second half of the season. I think we knew we had to replace a big part of our pitching rotation and we had some guys step up and Chris was one of those guys.”

Halstead said he never had performance more meaningful than Friday, considering all the circumstances.

“To be honest, I felt like I could go another seven (innings). I don’t want this to sound too cocky about it, but I felt good. I am just excited right now.”

106,From the Extension: Prepare now to weather the storm,"In the days leading up to Hurricane Irma, I found myself driving all over creation in desperate search of water, batteries, plywood and canned goods. Supplies were scarce, and the tension was palpable. I had not done the best job of preparing well in advance of the storm and judging by the number of people on the road, I was in pretty good company!

On sunny days, and we are blessed with so many here in Central Florida, it is hard to imagine the very real threat that a storm, such as a hurricane, can pose. Unfortunately, if you live in Florida it is not a matter of if a big storm will hit, but when. Preparing for hurricane season is somewhere on my to-do list, but every year it gets bumped to the bottom by more urgent issues — until such time that it is an urgent issue.

Setting aside a couple of hours to prepare in advance of the storm season is one of the best ways to assure that your family comes through, and recovers from, a hurricane with minimal damage. Some of this preparation is physical and involves trimming your vulnerable trees and removing yard debris. Other preparation, like stocking your emergency supply chest, may require some financial investment. Much of the preparation is mental and involves thinking through various scenarios with your family and determining ahead of time how you will react.

Ideally, your storm kit would include the following:

A three-day supply of clean, fresh water (one gallon per person per day) A three-day supply of non-perishable food and a can opener Battery powered or hand-cranked radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert (and extra batteries for both) Flashlight and extra batteries A well-stocked first aid kit A whistle to signal for help Garbage bags, moist towelettes and plastic ties for personal sanitation Tools (hammer, nails, wrench, pliers, etc.) Medications Copies of important documents in a watertight bag (insurance policies, identification cards, etc.) Matches Paper and pencils Mosquito repellent

If your family includes four-legged members, it is your responsibility to prepare for them as well. Each of my dogs has its own water-proof tote with copies of their vaccine records and microchip information. If we had to evacuate, I would add their medications and a three-day supply of food, divided into single serving sizes. They are also each crate trained and have their own foldable crate, though only the puppy uses hers at home. If we must evacuate, it is good to know that the experience of being in a crate will not create additional stress for them.

One of the best ways you can prepare is by attending our upcoming Lake County Hurricane Expo on Saturday, June 1 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the UF/IFAS Lake County Extension Office, 1951 Woodlea Rd in Tavares. This free educational event will feature lectures on hurricane preparedness and the opportunity to visit one-on-one with local experts. The first 250 participants will receive free goody bags, and everyone will have a chance to win additional storm-related prizes.

For more information, call 352-343-4101.

Remember, right now is the right time to prepare!

107,Think lovebugs are bad now? They once caused safety crisis,"Drivers used to have to pull off the interstate every 10 miles just to wipe the paste of guts from their windshield during lovebug season.

They’re pesky, they’re plentiful, and they’re probably splattered all over the front of your car.

Welcome back, lovebugs! We did not miss you.

Pray for Florida. Nothing actually wrong, it's just #LoveBugs season pic.twitter.com/Mwo9k8HMD3

— SpicyLad (@SpicesMc) May 6, 2019

It’s the return of our least favorite clingy couple, the tiny jerks who spend about 12 hours having intercourse — and usually fly in your face at some point during the process.

Yes, the front of your car has accumulated more carnage than the Battle of Winterfell. Yes, it’s gross. But the lovebug population actually used to be so much worse.

Lovebugs arrived in Florida sometime during the mid 1900s. The invasive species came to Texas from Central America and migrated east, creeping from Louisiana down to Florida. (No, University of Florida researchers did not create them in a lab to eat mosquitos — that is a myth.)

Things weren’t so bad, at first. But over the years, humans accidentally created the perfect recipe for these invaders to flourish. Farmers rearranged the way pastures were organized, bringing cattle closer together instead of letting them spread out far across open fields. Meanwhile, the Florida Road Department increased its grass-trimming by the highway.

Where do lovebugs thrive? Among cow poop and cut grass.

The bugs spread across the state. By the late ’60s and early ’70s, there were so many lovebugs that it could be dangerous to drive during the day, said Dr. Norman Leppla, a professor in the University of Florida’s Department of Entomology and Nematology.

You’d have to pull off the interstate every 10 miles just to wipe the paste of guts from your windshield, or else you wouldn’t be able to see where you were going.

“Many service stations charge up to 75 cents to remove a lovebug incrustation if that motorist doesn’t buy at least 10 gallons of gasoline,” said a 1972 article in the St. Petersburg Times.

Forget about lemonade stands. Children used to stand along the highway offering lovebug cleaning services for a dollar.

The state’s Plant Industry Division took to the skies to solve the problem, spraying insecticides from a helicopter over the highway to kill the bugs. But they quickly came back.

In 1971, the Legislature shot down a bill that would have authorized $25,000 to stop the pests.

Politicians soon realized they’d made a mistake. Just one year later, the state of Florida decided it had enough of lovebugs.

In October 1972, Florida Democratic Rep. William Chappell Jr. testified in Washington, D.C., about the winged horrors his constituents were facing.

“The number of lovebugs in central and northeast Florida has reached mammoth proportions and constitutes an hazardous situation to the motoring public,"" Chappell told the Agriculture Department. ""This epidemic has already affected the tourist trade and the local people are plagued with stopped-up air conditioners and radiators.”

Chappell wasn’t able to get the emergency funds he requested. The state of Florida had to finance the lovebug war on its own. That month, Florida Gov. Reubin Askew and other members of the Florida cabinet ultimately decided to devote $75,000 in state university research funds.

Researchers spent several years focusing on lovebugs. By the end of the ’70s, lovebugs were still annoying, but not plentiful enough to be dangerous anymore.

To this day, entomologists still have no idea why the population dwindled, Leppla said.

“Typically, an 'alien invasive species’ like the lovebug arrives, becomes established, reproduces prolifically, and survives in high numbers until it is affected by limiting factors (pathogens, predators, parasites, competitors, host availability, etc.),” he wrote in an email.

Researchers don’t know the habitat limitations of lovebugs. Maybe it was too wet or dry for the larvae to survive? It’s also possible other creatures in nature helped — robins could have developed a taste for lovebug larvae, or maybe armadillos found them first.

As the lovebug population decreased, the bugs no longer were a threat to drivers and slipped comfortably into the “nuisance” category. Researchers shifted their priorities to other, more dangerous critters.

“It’s been a decade since we’ve had enough bugs to clog radiators,"" Leppla said.

That being said, don’t expect them to go away forever. Even though a recent study said more than 1 million species face extinction, there’s no sign that lovebugs are even close to becoming endangered.

Researchers aren’t monitoring the population, so there’s no data-driven way of comparing how many bugs we have this year to last year. But based on the number of calls Leppla receives each year (and the buildup on the front of his own car), he said it seems like there has been an increase.

According to research by the University of Florida, lovebugs feed on decaying matter and return organic material into the soil. So they do have at least one positive benefit, other than providing a biannual traumatic experience that brings Floridians together.

Twitter, Facebook and Reddit are filled with photos of this year’s particularly gnarly lovebug infestation.

It’s like a gunky, crusty train wreck. We can’t look away.

The good news is, the bugs will be gone soon, though their short stay can still wreak havoc on your paint job.

It’s not that lovebugs themselves are acidic – Leppla tested them himself to disprove this. Instead, the damage is caused by the insect’s chemical-rich eggs.

Leppla and his colleagues have seen some truly creative methods to ward off the bugs.

“Sometimes we have symposia where we present all of these interesting ideas people come up with,"" he said. ""And sometimes we laugh so hard we fall out of our chairs.”

One trick that went viral involves putting baby oil in a bowl of water. You may have seen the post.

It looks effective, but unless the trap is in a confined space it won’t prevent more bugs from coming.

You’re better off focusing on protecting your car. There are loads of methods out there, from spraying cooking oil on your bumper to pouring Coca Cola on the paint. One of the most popular hacks involves using a damp dryer sheet. Leppla warns that while effective, that one turns dead bugs to mush and creates a mess.

The best trick of all (and one that won’t damage your car) is the most simple. Just carry a spray bottle with water and some car cleaning fluid, and wipe down the front of your car at the end of the day.

Oh, and get a wax a few times a year. Lovebug season only comes in May and September, but there are plenty of other bugs that can splat on your bumper during the other months.

110,Man o' Wars washing up on St. Augustine Beach,"ST. AUGUSTINE BEACH, Fla. - Some people heading to St. Augustine Beach have seen some Man o' Wars on the sand. Members of the St. Augustine Lifesaving Association said they have a couple Man o' Wars but nothing too much out of the ordinary.

They said they get pushed onto shore by winds and tides every so often.

The Portuguese man o' war is a predatory species. It uses its feeding tentacles to sting and paralyze small fishes, pelagic crustaceans, and other invertebrates. The feeding tentacles may be up to 160 feet long in some individuals! These tentacles deliver a powerful sting and are also used for defense against predation.

Each individual Portuguese man o' war is either a male or a female, and they reproduce sexually via a method known as broadcast spawning. Large groups of individuals come together, where females release their eggs and males release their sperm into the water column, all at the same time. This method increases the likelihood that eggs will be fertilized.

The Portuguese man o' war is not valuable, commercially, and is common throughout the tropics. In some places, it is increasing in numbers, likely a result of changing open ocean food webs. This species’ sting can be very painful if encountered by people. When there are large numbers of individuals in an area, it is best to avoid swimming.

They are covered in venom-filled nematocysts used to paralyze and kill fish and other small creatures. For humans, a man-of-war sting is excruciatingly painful but rarely deadly.

111,Lake Okeechobee levels rise with the rainy season less than a month away,"CLOSE The Caloosahatchee River is the largest river in Southwest Florida and stretches from Lake Okeechobee to the Gulf of Mexico. Fort Myers News-Press

The liquid heart of the historic Everglades has likely bottomed out for the year as rain is forecast for the next week and the rainy season is less than a month away.

""In the month of May we’ve already had a considerable amount of rain and that trend through the rest of the month is likely to continue,"" said John Mitnik, with the South Florida Water Management District, the state agency in charge of moving water in the Everglades system.

Lake Okeechobee is the key to managing a 16-county water district that stretches from just south of Orlando to the Florida Keys.

Water that flows into and out of the lake dictates everything from discharges to the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie rivers to how much water is available for Everglades National Park and Florida Bay.

More: Federal water managers say another blue-green algae bloom on Okeechobee likely

The surface of the lake fell to just above 11 feet above sea level earlier this month, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency that manages the lake.

""It had been trending down throughout the past month or so, but with the recent rains this week lake levels have actually increased some,"" Mitnik said.

Lake levels have been kept between 12.5 and 15.5 feet above sea level in the past decade or so to provide flood protection for thousands of people living south of the lake while also providing drinking water to millions of Floridians and what's left of the Everglades.

But Corps leaders agreed this year to let the lake fall in hopes that more storage will be available during the upcoming rainy season. The idea is that lower lake levels will allow the Corps to hold back releases in case there's another blue-green algae bloom on the lake.

Last year a bloom started on the lake in June and was found in the Caloosahatchee soon after.

Some organizations and politicians have said they'd like to see the surface of the lake at 10.5 feet above sea level to cut down on summer releases to the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie rivers.

More rain is in the forecast.

""For the next couple of days into the weekend we're going to have summer-like afternoon and evening thunderstorms,"" said Jennifer Hubbard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Ruskin, said Friday. ""But Monday and Tuesday there's going to be a front. It's the weakened tail end of the front and moisture from that will allow for more scattered thunderstorms, but it's not going to be the typical summer-time stuff.""

Hubbard said that daily highs will be in the upper 80s to lower 90s.

She said the rainy season will start within the next month or so.

""There is no hard-fast date for when the rainy season begins but it's usually by the mid-June time frame,"" Hubbard said. ""Some years it might be a little earlier and sometimes it might be a little bit later. The pattern we're in is kind of a transition into summer.""

Mitnik said the wet season may have already started.

""The call on 'yes, the rainy season has started,' is more of a retrospective call,"" Mitnik said Thursday at a water management district meeting. ""Depending on how far that front comes down and how it effects weather patterns about mid-week to the end of next week. There may be a small gap in time with a couple of drier days and then the wet season will have likely started after that but if the front doesn’t make it all the way down the peninsula, more than likely, last week I would say the rainy season has already started and the wet season has already started.""

El Nino has been impacting weather recently and is expected to this summer and possibly into the fall.

More: Low Lake Okeechobee levels have some concerned, others hopeful

""El Nino is likely to continue through the summer and even into the fall there's a 55 to 65 percent chance of it continuing, but honestly it doesn't have much of an impact in the summer,"" Hubbard said. ""We might see a little bit less hurricane activity but it's not a huge factor.""

112,"Work crew saves emaciated, abandoned dog in Lake County","LEESBURG, Fla. - Members of a work crew are being credited for springing into action to save an emaciated pit bull that had been abandoned.

Matthew Dexter and Aaron Cates, who work for the Lake County Public Works Maintenace Operations department, were mowing grass Tuesday along Sunnyside Drive in Leesburg when they spotted the weak, thin dog in the area.

They held her back to prevent her from getting hit by a car while they called Lake County Animal Shelter to pick her up. When the dog arrived at the shelter, she weighed only 22 pounds.

The dog, now named Glory, received emergency medical care thanks to a partnership with Pit Sisters, Inc. in Jacksonville. Veterinarians gave her fluids and supportive care as she recuperated.

Glory is now eating, drinking and gaining her strength back thanks to Dexter, Cates and the shelter staff.

""I know we have a great group of employees, but this week, I found out we have a couple of heroes,"" said Lake County Road Operations Division Manager Lori Koontz.

(Photo: MALCOLM DENEMARK/FLORIDA TODAY)

Spotting a cute, young woman headed to the ATM machine, Jaden McCart never thought he'd be changing the meaning of ""grocery store checkout line.""

""I came in shopping for groceries but I didn't know I was going to find a wife,"" said Jaden, recalling that day 20 years ago at the Melbourne Beach Publix. ""The minute I laid my eyes on her ...""

Cristle was 15 heading to Sebastian River High; Jaden was 16 at Melbourne High. Somehow, love found its way among the asparagus, yogurt and soda pop.

Recently, the Indialantic couple celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary by eating baked goods for lunch in Cristle's classroom at Gemini Elementary in Melbourne Beach. She teaches first grade in the same room where shelearned her ABCs.

Now the mother of four is ready to spend Mother's Day with her all-American family, which includes 10-year-old twin surfers, Beckham and Daya, who already are stirring waves.

A model family? Perhaps.

""We definitely make mistakes, like we all do; we have to grow from those mistakes,"" Cristle said. ""Being with someone for so long, through teenagers, we've relied on our faith in God and really working hard to get where we are today.""

Jaden, 36, co-owner of McCart Insurance in Palm Bay, said: ""She's the type of mom that puts her kids and family 100 percent first ... she's very passionate.""

Their eldest daughter, Reese, 15, plays soccer and lacrosse at Melbourne Central Catholic, while her baby brother, 2-year-old Aris, is a bundle of fun playing in the sand at the beach.

But it's the twin surfing sensations, Beckham and his sister Daya, who have gotten plenty of notice lately.

Surfers get 'twin inspiration'

Toes in the sand, Cristle kept a close eye on her kids during the recent Eastern Surfing Association Regional contest at Paradise Beach in Indialantic, where Beckham and Daya were competing in the finals.

The fraternal twins, who often surf up in age class, have collected so many trophies that their father donates many of them back to the Gnarly Charley Surf Series, ""where we all started.""

Recently, Beckham took second place in two divisions at the National Scholastic Surfing Association East Coast Championships in New Smyrna Beach and placed third in the 12-under division at the ESA event.

Daya claimed double first places in the 12s and 14s for the entire season of ESA, won the 12-under NSSA, Open 10-under title and reached the 12-under ESA Regional finals.

They'll head to California for the nationals in June at Huntington Beach.

So, who's the better surfer?

""Me,"" Daya quickly said. ""I have a better backside (surfing maneuver) and I am stronger.""

""No. no, no, don't write that down,"" Beckham said, pointing at his chest. ""Me, me, me.""

The twins already have collected an assortment of sponsors, including world-famous Billabong clothing, a deal struck with the help of local company rep Scott Bouchard, a surfing star during his heyday.

""They're adorable; they wear the clothing and look good in it,"" Cristle said.

Posters, marquees, ads ... ""hopefully, one day,"" she said.

""There's a Beckham in soccer, there's one in football, and now one in surfing,"" she said, laughing.

The twins were 3 years old when they first hopped on their dad's surfboard wanting to learn.

Jaden happens to be an accomplished surfer, who caught waves coast to coast as a youngster and remains among the top amateurs, winning the 2019 NSSA and ESA season crowns and is ranked second on the East Coast. His brother, Rylan, competed for years on the World Qualifying Series and now is the area director for Trinity Fitness Centers.

The twins also train with surfing legend John Holeman.

And mom? ""I sit on the beach and look pretty,"" she said. ""But I do love the ocean.""

Beckham has gotten to surf with 11-time world champion Kelly Slater of Cocoa Beach, and he and his sister have gotten some ""twin inspiration"" when the world's most famous surfing twins, C.J. and Damien Hobgood of Satellite Beach, spent a day at their house watching an NBA game.

""Their dad's a classic (surfer), I grew up surfing with him,"" said C.J., the 2001 world champion who has surfed with Beckham at Sebastian Inlet. ""The twins are so funny and they rip, too. That would be so cool for them both to make the tour, one on the female side and one on the men's.""

Before that, though, there's reading, writing and arithmetic.

Beckham and Daya ride their bikes together to school and are in the same fourth-grade class at Indialantic Elementary. ""We got each other's backs,"" Daya said.

While they share common traits, there are a couple of differences between the twins, who have even tricked their mom by dressing as each other.

""We're different,"" Beckham said. ""My sister likes avocados and ... what are those red things called? Tomatoes! I don't like those.""

Their only confrontation comes when they get back from the beach.

""Who gets in the hot shower first,"" Beckham said.

Pregnancy scare for mom

Cristle's pregnancy with the twins was a challenge for her and Jaden.

""I knew I was pregnant, but three months in, I got really sick,"" she said.

""I had a full OB exam, and they discovered that Beckham was hiding behind Daya in my womb, since twins share the same sac. So I knew I was having twins.""

Her illness forced her to lie in a hospital bed at Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne, where Dr. Wesley Foster monitored her preeclampsia complications and blood pressure, which ""was way too high.""

""Sure enough, the twins arrived happy and healthy. And they're still giving me high blood pressure,"" Cristle said jokingly.

During those three months, Jaden naturally had to limit his surfing.

""I was like a single parent (with Reese, then 5),"" Jaden said. ""I never had to operate without (Cristle). I was definitely worried about her health and the babies' health. I had to adapt. Luckily, my parents live in Melbourne Beach and Cristle's parents live in Grant, and both were a great help. Cristle's mom is a great cook.""

Cristle said she was concerned, as well.

""I kind of am the one that does everything, cooks, does mainly all the stuff,"" she said. ""But he's really good with kids and this pretty much prepared him for our life today. With four kids, we have a lot going on, a lot of activities. I'm not here all the time, so it was a good learning experience.

""A lot of prayer and faith got us through.""

Mother's Day is always special for the McCarts. A trip to mom's, dinner at a seafood restaurant with the family.

And who knows? Maybe a trip to the grocery store. Just to bring back some memories.

118,Carpet cleaner accused of stealing fine jewelry from client,"FLAGLER COUNTY, Fla. - A carpet cleaner is accused of stealing a valuable ring and earrings from a client and pawning the items, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies said the victim called them on April 29 to report that a garnet ring valued at $8,000 and a pair of diamond hoop earrings worth $4,500 had been stolen from her home. The victim noticed the items were missing on Feb. 24, four days after she had her carpets cleaned, but waited to report them stolen until she could verify that they had not been misplaced.

She said the carpet cleaner was the only person who had been in her home in that time frame, according to the arrest report.

Deputies said the owner of the carpet cleaning company was distraught to hear what had happened and identified the employee who had been in the victim's home as 21-year-old Christian Lane.

A search of a pawn database found that Lane sold the earrings and the ring to a pawnshop in Palm Coast in February, according to the affidavit. By the time deputies went to the shop in May, the ring had been pieced out and melted down and the earrings had been sold. The pawnshop gave Lane $250 for the ring, records show.

Deputies said they learned that an engagement ring that was pawned the same time as the other items had been stolen from a couple. The report does not indicate whether Lane cleaned the carpets at that couple's home.

Lane was interviewed Monday at his apartment and admitted to pawning the items because he ""needed money to pay for items in addition to rent,"" the report said.

He was arrested on charges of dealing in stolen property, two counts of grand theft and false verification of ownership. He's being held at the Flagler County Jail.

120,Bride shames wedding guest who allegedly brought '10 Tupperware containers' to take home leftovers,"- This guest is apparently a big fan of leftovers, and upsetting the bride.

A woman from western Pennsylvania wrote on Facebook’s immensely popular “That’s it I’m Wedding Shaming” group about an alleged incident involving her wedding and a very hungry guest.

“My husband and I had a very small wedding ceremony and reception, probably about 25 people were invited,” she writes. “Only close family and a handful of friends.”

However, a few days before the wedding her dad’s friend asked if he could bring his daughter and her husband to the nuptials — to which she said she “didn’t have a problem with it.”

“So [the daughter] shows up, without her husband, but with about 10 Tupperware containers. TO TAKE FOOD,” the outraged bride claims, stating her wedding was buffet style.

“She loaded up 7 Tupperware containers with food to take home, took about 3 containers of homemade cookies, a couple of bottles of beers, and most [of] the centerpieces,” she wrote.

Though the anonymous bride said she “didn’t notice any of this” at the time because she was busy tending to the other guests at the wedding, she said her dad told her about it the next day.

However, the bride’s frustration with the guest continued when she opened up the woman’s gift to the couple.

“And when we opened up our ‘gift’ from her — she gave us $5. Not even kidding. A five dollar bill.”

The bride went on to claim that the offending woman was “not poor by any stretch of the imagination,” and stated she was “probably better off than [the bride.]”

Those on the post were also horrified by the woman’s actions.

“She loaded up 7 Tupperware containers with food to take home, took about 3 containers of homemade cookies, a couple of bottles of beers, and most [of] the centerpieces,” the bride wrote of the offending guest.

""Some people have no shame, I would be mortified to scab off someone like this, esp (especially) at a wedding,” one wrote.

“Message her asking for money to cover the cost of the food and center pieces she took,” another suggested.

“Omg my in-laws (husband's aunts) did this at our engagement party. I didn't know what to say, and they are medical doctors too, so not poor,” one woman shared.

Coating car bumpers, creeping up front doors -- even crawling around a cruise ship -- it seems lovebugs are covering plenty of ground this spring, more so than usual.""Apparently, it's been a good year for their survival,"" Dr. Norman Leppla said. Leppla is a UF professor of etymology and says it does seem all the conditions are right to make Central Florida an even more fertile breeding ground for the lovebugs. ""It's conjecture, but it seems like the last few years have been drier than usual and the love bugs have been down, and maybe this is a wetter year,"" Leppla said. For many people, the extra bugs mean extra car-washing.""They're pesky little critters,"" Betsy Steward said. ""You have to get them off the car in a hurry because they will eat into the paint on the car.""Steward says she's been washing her car several times a week for the past few weeks, and it needed another rinse after after a quick trip from Orlando to the coast and back. ""I went over to Brevard County and on 528, it's massive, just sheets of black,"" she said. ""Doesn't take a scientific mind to see there are more this year than there have been in several years.""The scientific consensus from Leppla: Lovebugs are simply a nuisance during spring and fall and Floridians just have to learn to live with them whether their season seems abundant or not. ""They're no threat at all. They don't bite and sting. They don't have diseases, they're not poisonous. You can wash them off your car every day. You've got to live with them for a couple of weeks,"" Leppla said.",https://www.wesh.com/article/think-you-re-seeing-more-lovebugs-than-usual-you-re-right/27439259,2019-05-10T23:36:00Z,WESH-TV,Couple,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789
131,Kimberly Kessler asks about death penalty in jailhouse call,"NASSAU COUNTY, Fla. - Jailhouse phone calls that Kimberly Kessler, the woman charged with killing her co-worker Joleen Cummings, made after she was arrested last year were obtained Friday by News4Jax.

Kessler, 50, discusses complains jail conditions in a couple of the calls, but in the first one, she asks about the death penalty.

Kessler: “Florida and Texas, are those the only two states with the death penalty?”

Caller: “I don’t know, I haven’t done the research on that. You might want to YouTube that and get back to me on it.”

Kessler: “Yeah, I don’t think I’d want to know and then tell you bad news. I thought someone said they weren’t doing that anymore, and they shouldn’t do it anymore because the dumb***** get everything wrong.""

The release of the calls comes ahead of Mother's Day weekend, which marks one year since Cummings, a 34-year-old mother of three, disappeared.

Investigators suspect Kessler, who worked with Cummings at Tangles hair salon in Yulee, was the last person to see Cummings alive.

Following Cummings’ disappearance, her SUV was found parked outside a Home Depot. Kessler was arrested May 16, 2018, after investigators said they found footage showing her getting out of the vehicle and booked into the Nassau County jail, where she went on a hunger strike that prompted her to later be moved to the Duval County jail.

It's unclear at which jail the calls were made from, but she complains about the treatment in the jail in two of them.

“My attorney told me he has no control over them. They mistreat me. That’s just how it is, basically. He didn’t say it exactly in those words. That’s my interpretation of it. So I’m surprised they let me call you. Perhaps they were looking to listen to a fascinating conversation in between us. I don’t know why they let me call you, but they did. He said they should let me call him whenever I want, and they didn’t, they didn’t let me do it. They make excuses, like, ‘Oh we’re busy,’ then shut the door and walk away. It’s kind of funny they keep me in solitary confinement, like, it’s a bad thing,"" Kessler said with a laugh in one jailhouse call. ""It’s heaven, girl.”

In another call, Kessler, who went by Jennifer Sybert, talks about wanting out of jail. Authorities said she has used 17 aliases over the years.

Kessler: “Bail me out under my name that I’m going under, which is Jennifer Marie Sybert. And then eventually everything’s going to come together, but, with my real name Kim Kessler. But you know, go about it, jump through the hoops.”

Person on the other end of the call: “OK. You said bail you out under Jennifer?""

Kessler: “Yeah, because that’s how they arrested me under. Until the FBI corrects it, it’s gonna be Jennifer.”

Other person: “The FBI? Oh, my God, they won’t correct.“

Kessler: “They will. You just put the money up as Jennifer Marie Sybert. I gave you my Social, by date of birth the name, my name my alias or whatever that I’ve been living under for 19 years. You’re all set.”

Other person: “Oh, my God. Are you warm, sleeping alright? They gave you a blanket?”

Kessler: “Of course not. It’s terrible. I’m in jail. It’s very, very bad.""

Other person: “It would be nice if they treated you the way they would want to be treated.”

Kessler: “Well, if you really want to help come and get me out. So, that would be great.”

Kessler is now charged with first-degree murder in Cummings’ death. The day after she was indicted on Sept. 7, she discusses how unexpected the indictment was during a call.

“I didn’t expect it to come, but I was… I guess it was always in the back of my mind because I knew they were crazy like that, because they did it to me before. I don’t know. I guess I got too trusting, like, I thought their BS was over. Tom Townsend (her lawyer) told me today that I was on the front page of the newspaper, I’m all over the news. He said they had a bunch of people call the public defender’s office -- Newsline or Dateline called, a bunch of entities or whatever, like news channels, were calling today. I was (like), 'Really?’ He said, 'They were all calling. You’re all over the newspaper, all over the news.' And I was, like, 'Really?’” she can be heard saying in the call.

A year later, Cummings’s body has not been found, despite an extensive search at a Georgia landfill that turned up items of interest.

Since then, the state has released reams of evidence in the case through the discovery process that suggest a struggle occurred at the salon and that steps were taken to dispose of that evidence.

133,"1 arrested, 3 sought in Vero Beach on 'breach of peace' charge alleging sex in public area off 14th Avenue","Vero Beach Police Department (Photo: LAMAUR STANCIL/TCPALM)

VERO BEACH — One woman has been arrested and three other people have warrants out for their arrest, all accused of having sex in public view downtown one afternoon on 14th Avenue.

Police said they got two calls about two couples, about 10 feet apart, engaging in sexual intercourse in a grassy area of a parking lot in the 1900 block of 14th Avenue in full view of passersby and across the street from a restaurant at about 3:20 p.m. April 28.

Myra Olin, 56, who is homeless in Vero Beach, was arrested Thursday night on a charge of disorderly breach of peace.

Francis Rhinehart, 57; Peter Jankowski Jr., 47; and Lisa Goldenberg, 52, all homeless in Vero Beach, according to police, have open warrants for their arrest on the same charge. As of Friday afternoon, they had not been arrested.

A woman who called police said she was driving by the area when she saw the two couples and was shocked. The woman called police and sent pictures to them.

When officers arrived, they said they saw each couple together.

Jankowski Jr. and Olin told the officers ""we were just messing around.""

Officers said Rhinehart and Goldenberg told them they got ""caught up in the moment.""

Vero Beach police Lt. John Pedersen said the incident is ""unique"" for downtown Vero Beach in broad daylight.

""It's not a call that we typically get,"" he said. ""I mean we have had calls over the years of people on the beach or in a car or something where it was in a more private setting, but this was pretty appalling of these people to be engaged in this type of activity.""

Photos and a video of the two couples were circulated on a Vero Beach community Facebook page, prompting many comments from concerned residents. The images were taken down and reposted a few times before being removed for good.

Pedersen said from what he observed and understood from speaking to two witnesses, sexual organs were not plainly observed. He said one of the men's buttocks was clearly seen, but that isn't enough to charge someone with anything more than disorderly breach of peace.

""Do we normally have people having sex openly out in public, no, the answer to that is no,"" Pedersen said.

Two-year-old James Horton loves to sing along as his mom plays the piano, play outside with his brother and sister and sit in his dad's backpack harness when the family goes hiking.

The bright little boy, inquisitive and playful, was diagnosed with a brain tumor when he was just three months old.

This Saturday, his dad, Wiley Horton, a local intellectual property attorney, will speak at University of Florida's Brain Tumor Education Day, where patients and loved ones can learn about treatments and research related to the disease. He will share his family's story.

When James was about 5 weeks old, his mom Eva Horton noticed his bright green eyes were wobbling. The condition, called nystagmus, led a neurologist to call for an MRI. A first scan showed swelling in the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain.

After a second MRI at UF Health Shands Hospital, little James was diagnosed with an optic pathway glioma, a slow-growing tumor involving the glial cells in the brain.

Buy Photo Eva and Wiley Horton with their children James, 2, left, Charlie, 4 and Eliza, 6 at their Tallahassee home Thursday, May 9, 2019. (Photo: Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat)

""I didn't know what a glioma was and I didn't know what the prognosis was,"" said Wiley. ""We prayed, is what we did.""

He and Eva felt relief after meeting with a Shands pediatric brain tumor specialist.

""He said, 'The first thing you need to know is this threatens his vision, not his life,'"" Wiley said.

James has shown some hesitation with depth perception, Eva explained. But since he's so young, testing the impact the tumor has had on his vision is difficult, Wiley added.

Located at the base of the cerebrum, the tumor is inoperable, Wiley said. But after different chemotherapy trials, James has been responding well to his latest immunotherapy treatment, Avastin, which helps his immune system fight the cancer.

Since starting it seven weeks ago, James' parents said he has been vocalizing observations, like naming his nurse from down the hall at the hospital, or pointing out the yellow school bus as they're driving.

""That's something to celebrate ... You want the best for your baby, you know— and it just makes me think it’s possible. I think he’s improving and I think it's this new drug,"" Eva said. ""I think he's been seeing a lot better in the past couple weeks.""

Wiley said James has tolerated the chemo and therapy very well.

""We just had a scan last Friday that showed it's really being quite effective,"" he said. ""The cancer is becoming much less active and the Avastin is doing what it's hoped to do.""

For the next one and a half to two years, James and his family will commute to Shands every other week for treatment sessions — a ""walk in the park"" compared to previous treatments, which required the family to make the 150-mile drive weekly.

James loves sliding on couch cushions across the floor with his siblings in a makeshift game of bumper cars, strumming on his dad's guitar and telling knock-knock jokes. But he even enjoys his hospital visits, riding the elevators and interacting with nurses. The little boy doesn't flinch when he gets his finger pricked.

The family is optimistic and grateful about the new treatment.

“It’s just kind of overwhelming."" Eva said. ""But from the beginning … we’ve been surrounded … by people who their kids are facing so much worse.""

136,The right-left divide is clear as day in legislation passed this session | Guestview,"Does it seem that Florida legislators are passing laws, more often than they used to, for the purpose of scoring political points – rather than setting policy for the state?

Of course, they’ve always done that to some extent, going back to the “interposition resolution” of the 1950s and other silly symbolic acts aimed at defying the integration orders from federal courts. But at least, in those days, legislators knew they were just pandering to voters.

Now it seems they really intend to see even their most controversial legislative actions carried out. Until those dreaded federal judges say otherwise, some of the big bills produced along strict party lines this year will do little more than clearly define the difference between Democrats and Republicans.

Or between liberals and conservatives, which is pretty much the same thing.

Take the immigration bill, for instance. Like President Trump, Republicans purport to perceive a law-and-order crisis caused by undocumented migration, and to believe it can be eased by forbidding local governments to adopt “sanctuary city” policies. There are no sanctuary cities in Florida, at least not in the San Francisco sense, but Gov. Ron DeSantis and other GOP candidates promised voters last year they’d get tough on this situation.

CLOSE Around one hundred protestors chanted in the Capitol rotunda after nearly a dozen were removed from the House gallery for unfurling banners and yelling. Tori Schneider, Tallahassee Democrat

Democrats, meanwhile, pretended not to understand why local governments should have to comply with an “immigration detainer” from the feds. Those are issued when a law-enforcement agency believes an arrested person may be a “removable alien” under federal law.

“The actions of the Florida Legislature today simply don’t represent the richness and diversity of our state,” Andrew Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor and 2018 Democratic nominee for governor, said in a prepared statement. “Republican legislators pushed through a vicious bill – despite bipartisan opposition – that brings shame to a state that prides itself in the richness of its cultures….”

DeSantis, who beat Gillum last November, saw it a bit differently.

“We are a stronger state when we protect our residents, foster safe communities and respect the work of law enforcement at every level,” the governor said. “Local law enforcement agencies can and should work with the federal government to ensure that accountability and justice are one in our state.”

Such widely divergent views of the same bill makes us wonder if the long, starkly partisan debate was really about passing a needed law or pandering to partisans on either side. Everything else is details.

The same can be said of the school vouchers legislation sent to the governor’s desk earlier in the week. A handful of House Democrats voted for the plan, which uses state tax money to pay tuition at private schools for needy students, but there was an easily identifiable partisan divide.

And forbidding local governments, for the next five years, to ban the use of plastic straws? That one was generally Republicans yes, Democrats no.

Arming teachers in the classroom? Nobody really likes the idea but if you showed a newcomer the rollcall on that legislation and asked what is the Republican-Democrat population of the House and Senate, they might reasonably guess the numbers are roughly the same.

And down to the 60th day of the session, they wrangled with implementation of Amendment 4, the proposal more than 5 million voters approved last November to restore voting rights of felons who’ve served their time. Republicans generally wanted to make it harder for ex-cons, requiring financial restitution many of them can’t pay, while Democrats demanded that lawmakers just follow the clear direction of the voters.

Maybe they were all just thinking of fairness and good public policy. Or maybe there was a little virtue-signaling on both sides – Republicans posturing as tough on crime, Democrats showing they know how most of those guys are likely to vote, with their rights restored.

On another down-to-the-wire issue, probably prompted by that felon-voting public initiative, Republicans sought new restrictions on gathering voter signatures. The Democrats were, predictably, opposed. Guess which side accomplishes what it can via constitutional amendments put on the ballot with voter signatures.

There were a couple of bills filed this session on the biggest defining difference between Democrats and Republicans – abortion – but that one didn’t get a big debate. Georgia, Alabama and a few other states passed bills likely to get the issue back before the U.S. Supreme Court.

But if the leadership wants another bitterly partisan floor debate, complete with shouting protesters in the rotunda, they can always move some abortion bills next session. Best of all, it’ll be an election year.

139,Superintendent: Raines will not consolidate into 6-12 school,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - During a meeting Thursday to address aging schools in Jacksonville, Dr. Diana Greene, the Duval County school superintendent, told a crowd that the scenario to consolidate Raines High School into a 6-12 school has been taken off the table.

The crowd applauded the decision. Nearly 100 schools were identified in the Duval County School Board's plan to replace, remodel and consolidate the district's aging schools.

As part of one scenario, which Greene said would no longer be considered, students from Northwestern Middle School would also attend Raines and the Northwestern Middle building would become an elementary school, consolidating Carver, Woodson and Payne elementary schools.

Nearby Ribault High School, which is 54 years old, has also been proposed to be replaced with a 6-12 school. Greene spent a couple hours on Monday night at Ribault, sharing scenarios that could help schools in that area.

On Tuesday, the board voted in favor of a half-cent sales tax to fund repairs and replacements of Jacksonville schools. The board wants to see the vote happen in November, but it would be the only issue on the ballot.

Mayor Lenny Curry on Thursday told News4Jax he is opposed to putting the measure before voters in a special election. He was not ready to comment on whether he supports the proposed tax.

Ultimately, it will be up to City Council to decide if and when the resolution would go before voters.

Titusville won a close victory over Melbourne Central Catholic in the District 9-5A baseball final on Thursday at Satellite.

It was the first district title for a Terriers baseball team since 2005, when Titusville lost to Nease in a Class 4A regional final.

Both the Terriers and MCC will enter the regional playoffs next week.

At Palm Bay, Rockledge scored five runs in the bottom of the third inning and won the District 13-6A title over Eau Gallie, 5-0. Three walks, three singles, a hit batter and a couple of errors sparked the Raiders, now 23-4.

Melbourne and Viera faced each other again in the District 6-7A final at USSSA Space Coast Stadium, and Ridge Skarbek scattered two hits over seven innings for the Melbourne win. Jason Blackstone went 2-for-4, and the Bulldogs won, 4-0.

The Brevard Heat, still unbeaten at 15-0, beat City of Life Christian in a semifinal on Tuesday, 10-0. They will face the host Geneva School on Friday at 4 p.m. for the District 4-2A title. Caleb Tuggle struck out seven in five innings against City of Life.

Brevard softball teams face rematches

Both Melbourne and Viera won their regional quarterfinal softball games on Wednesday, knocking off teams from District 5-7A. The two winners will play again Tuesday at 7 p.m.

In a 4-3 defeat of Deltona at Eastern Florida State College on Wednesday, the Hawks scored three in the bottom of the sixth to improve to 18-7. Karyana Mitchell, Anna Brait and Morgan Mordas each drove in runs.

In Matanzas, Natalia Cordero shut out the home team in a 6-0 Bulldogs win. Emily Shrader drove in two runs, and Melbourne improved to 23-5.

Likewise, Eau Gallie and Rockledge teams won their Wednesday night games against District 14-6A teams — the Raiders 11-1 over Port St. Lucie and the Commodores 10-3 at Suncoast — and they will play Tuesday at Rockledge, also at 7.

144,Southwest Airlines updates family boarding policy after Naples same-sex couple claims discrimination,"CLOSE A same-sex couple from Naples, Florida said Southwest Airlines denied them family boarding with their children in 2017. The airline updated its family boarding policy in 2019. Wochit, Wochit

Southwest Airlines has updated its family boarding policy nearly two years after a same-sex Naples couple with children said they faced discrimination by a boarding agent.

The revised policy says “two adults” can board together with children under 6 during family boarding. The policy had read “an adult” can board.

“We are happy with the resolution,” said Grant Morse, 56, who said he faced discrimination in 2017 by a gate agent and considered legal action.

The airline issued a statement that confirmed the policy was updated but refuted Morse’s account of what happened, as it did two years ago. The airline said no discrimination occurred.

“Never has Southwest’s Family Boarding Policy taken into account gender or marital status when determining ability to board early,” the statement said.

The airline investigated what happened and said there was “confusion in the boarding area surrounded the number, not the genders, of adults allowed early access to the aircraft in our Family Boarding,” the statement said.

“Both parents were allowed to board early with their children but we requested a third adult board with her assigned group,” the airline said.

From 2017: Same-sex couple says Southwest Airlines discriminated against them

Morse said his family faced discrimination May 20, 2017, during boarding for a Southwest Airlines flight from Buffalo, New York, to Fort Lauderdale. The family's story garnered international attention.

Morse was traveling with his husband, Sam Ballachino, their three young children, and Ballachino’s mother, who was helping with the children.

The gate agent allowed a heterosexual couple with a child — who were in line behind Morse and Ballachino — to board but stopped Morse and his family.

“She said, ‘This is not for you,’” Morse said, recalling the incident. “It was clearly discriminatory behavior. We were clearly profiled.”

The gate agent’s supervisor backed up the agent, and the family had to wait until the entire plane had boarded.

Morse said he was told four seats were saved for them in the back of the plane, but that was not enough for all of them to sit together.

Morse sat in the back with his twin sons, and his daughter was in a seat in front of him. His husband was a few seats away. Ballachino’s mother was seated in an emergency exit row.

After landing, Morse contacted Southwest to complain. He received a generic response that the airline was sorry for the family’s experience.

Southwest Airlines said in a statement in 2017 that the agent at the gate followed policy and both parents were invited to board. The third adult was ineligible to board and was asked to wait.

“The conversation in the boarding area had nothing to do with discrimination,” the 2017 statement said. “We welcomed both parents to board the aircraft with their children. The parents expressed disappointment that the Family Boarding policy did not apply to another member of their group.”

After the media publicity, Southwest Airlines offered a $300 voucher and another generic apology, Morse said. He wanted direct communication with airline executives.

He contacted the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, a nonprofit agency for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality. The center asked for help from Orrick, an international law firm.

“A year later we were filing suit and the attorneys were working back and forth, and (Southwest) said that they would like to meet us at their corporate headquarters,” Morse said.

Twenty airline executives, three corporate attorneys and one outside attorney for the airline met with the couple in Dallas on July 13, 2018.

The executives listened to the couple’s story and individually apologized, Morse said.

“They told us that change would come, they said change takes a lot of time,” he said.

In a statement, Southwest said the meeting was productive and friendly.

“The conversation prompted a closer look at the clarity of our policy through the viewpoints of both our customers and employees,” the statement said.

Last month, the Orrick attorney, Alvin Lee, was contacted by the airline and informed of the policy update effective May 1, 2019.

“We were able to engage in meaningful discussions with Southwest regarding the challenges that LGBTQ families face in their everyday lives,” Lee said in an email. “I am pleased that Southwest has taken certain steps to update its Family Boarding Policy, and that it is attempting to make its airline more welcoming for LGBTQ families.”

Morse said he now believes the 2017 incident occurred because of one rogue employee.

The airline in general is known for its diversity policy with employees, he added.

Since the 2017 incident, the family has not flown Southwest.

“Where we are today, we are reconsidering,” he said.

146,Jacksonville couple delivers baby in car on way to hospital,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - When she gets older, a Jacksonville couple will have quite the story to share with their newborn daughter. That’s because she was born nearly a month early in a car on the way to the hospital.

Laramie Cundiff and her partner, Brandon Meredith, knew they were expecting, so it wasn’t a surprise when she thought she was going into labor last week. But it turns out she was having what are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which can mimic the feeling of going into labor.

So when Cundiff began experiencing the same sensations again early Sunday morning, the couple initially brushed them off. After all, they figured it was likely just another round of Braxton Hicks contractions kicking in, right? Wrong. This time, the baby couldn’t wait.

“By the time we got in the car, I knew it was time. I could feel that pressure, but dad still thought it was Braxton Hicks,” Cundiff told News4Jax.

After piling into the car, the couple hopped on Interstate 95 and headed for Wolfson Children’s Hospital. But it didn’t matter what route they took or how fast they went. By the time they got off the exit ramp, Nova Lynn Meredith was waiting.

She was born at 7:20 a.m. May 5 near San Marco Boulevard and Gary Street – about 25 days early and roughly a stone’s throw from the hospital they were racing toward. She weighed 4.2 pounds and measured 16.5 inches tall.

But none of that truly sunk in for Meredith until Cundiff lifted the baby out of her pajama pants.

“His eyes got huge and he said, ‘What do I do?!’ And I told him to keep driving. We didn’t stop until we hit Wolfson’s emergency room doors,” Cundiff recalled.

For now, Nova is staying in the NICU at Wolfson until she's healthy enough to be released.

Even though he didn’t deliver the baby, it was a surreal experience for Meredith, too. He said he just sat there and watched as Cundiff’s maternal instincts kicked in.

“She grabbed the baby, she flipped the baby over, immediately started clearing out her mouth, getting her to breathe,” Meredith said. “And these weren’t things we were going to think about or planned to do.”

“She just did it,” he added.

The whole episode unfolded in less than an hour. But if they go could back and change how it happened, the couple said they wouldn’t do anything differently.

“I think it was the most perfect way for it to happen,” Cundiff said. “I really do.”

148,"April showers? Cold front brings rain, storms to Central Florida Friday","0 April showers? Cold front brings rain, storms to Central Florida Friday

Although we are still in the dry season, April has been drier than average so far for Orlando and Melbourne, but not for Sanford and Daytona Beach. The showers arriving on Friday could even out the rain gauge game for the areas where April’s rainfall is still at deficit.

Thursday will be another (mostly) picture-perfect day across Central Florida, but temperatures will be warmer than previous days, and you may notice a few more clouds. Highs will reach 90 degrees across most of Central Florida, with the winds coming from the south-southwest.

A front is on the way! I'm timing out some storms & the weekend changes, now on Channel 9. pic.twitter.com/lsC8cylTLa — Brian Shields (@BShieldsWFTV) April 25, 2019

Winds along the east central coast of Florida

After a stretch of sunny and warm conditions, a cold front sweeps over Central Florida Friday, bringing showers and the cahnce for some strong to severe storms. Rain will enter the area by 7 a.m. over Marion County. By 9 a.m., skies will be mostly cloudy and moderate to heavier showers will likely be over I-4. There could also be some strong to severe storms traveling over Orange, Seminole and Voluisa counties at this time. If this is the time when you are traveling to work or school, make sure to take your time or leave a bit earlier Friday. The main threat with the storms will be damaging wind gusts and hail. There is a low risk for tornadoes.

There's a lower end risk for a couple strong to severe storms tomorrow.

Main threats will be winds over 40mph.

Some storms could reach our northern areas as early as sunrise. pic.twitter.com/BAuBPqWFto — Rusty McCranie (@RMcCranieWFTV) April 25, 2019

Most showers will not stay aligned and sweep over Central Florida as with other cold fronts as this cold will be weakening as it moves over Florida. Some scattered showers may still be passing by during the lunch hour through the early afternoon. By 4 p.m. the front will be south of Central Florida and weather will improve. Friday evening will be clearing with temperatures in the mid-60s.

Check the water temperatures

As this front weakens and a high-pressure system parks just to our northwest, the high temperatures will be slightly cooler, only reaching the mid-80s on Saturday, but back to the upper 80s on Sunday. It will bring drier air on Saturday, which will make it feel very comfortable for outdoor activities, such as the Puerto Rican Parade.

149,Heat invades Central Florida,"ORLANDO, Fla. - It is all about the heat for the next couple of days in Central Florida.

""High pressure continues to remain firmly in place across the southeastern U.S., including Florida,"" News 6 meteorologist Troy Bridges said. ""This means sinking air will prevent the development of rain and certainly help block any storms from building in the region.

Orlando will reach a high of 88 Wednesday under mostly sunny skies, with no chance of rain. The average high on this date is 84.

""Expect a light, south-southeast wind from 3 to 5 mph,"" Bridges said. ""That wind will bring warm air and a little bit more humidity.""

Thursday's high will reach 90, with more humidity but no rain.

Overnight lows will be in the upper 60s.

""By Friday, a front approaches, as well as an area of low pressure building in from the Gulf of Mexico, which will increase our rain chances to 60%,"" Bridges said.

Rain chances are slim over the weekend, with highs in the mid-80s.

151,"Tallahassee 'water person' pursues mermaid dreams, tail and all","Buy Photo Jo Ostrov, a woman who always wanted to be a mermaid at Weeki Watchi Springs State Park, swims in the springs as a mermaid. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

Sometimes you have to wait for what you really want. You may not have told everyone about your dream. You might have been hesitant to reveal the depth of your fantasy. But if you’re ready when the magical opportunity comes — you’ll jump at the chance and your dreams can come true.

Especially if you want to be a mermaid.

A mermaid? OK. An unusual obsession perhaps, but where is it written that a 67-year-old grandmother, wife of a prominent retired physician, a garden designer, former beekeeper and environmentalist can’t also have fantasized about living the good life under the waves, wriggling her tail in graceful arcs and fraternizing with benevolent turtles and fish?

For one Tallahassee woman who has actually worn the flippers — nowhere is it written!

Jo Ostrov sits on the edge of a hot tub beneath a garden gazebo. Above her is a sign indicating we have entered an outdoor sanctum she calls her Mermaid Lagoon. Though not a watery lagoon per se, it is where Ostrov repairs to soak up the ambiance she has created in the little garden grotto.

Surrounded with table-sized clam shells, and smaller exotic shells from the Phillippines, Hawaii, Costa Rica, and Japan, Ostrov has adorned herself with colorful, exotic mollusk jewelry at her wrists, neck and ears. Mermaid statuary is nearby and the entire “lagoon” palette is touched with aqua… including the color of Ostrov’s nails. “I am a “water person,” she says matter-of-factly. “My husband is a land-man, but he respects my need to be near and in the water every day.”

Buy Photo Jo Ostrov, a woman who always wanted to be a mermaid at Weeki Watchi Springs State Park, in her backyard which she turned into a mermaid lagoon Friday, April 26, 2019. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

And she means it. Ostrov swims at Premier Health and Fitness pool four or five times a week. Her five garden venues include small ponds, bubbling fountains, and winding streams. And she is never happier than when on the yearly vacations the couple has made to Hawaii since the '80s, Ostrov finds herself swimming in the clear, warm waters of Kauai.

Other favorite venues to interact with dolphins, turtles, and commune with whales, will find her snorkeling, scuba-diving, or body surfing beside youths a third her age. Jo Ostrov was most definitely cut out to be a mermaid. Yet it might not have been so.

“I was born in Akron,” she says. “One of nine children, we didn’t go to fancy country clubs to learn to swim, but rather to one of Ohio’s muddy lakes where a Red Cross instructor would oversee our progress. My mother, sitting on the sand, never really learned.”

In high school, Ostrov was in the school pool every day of summer, later becoming a life guard at Ohio State. She added swimming with the synchronized team and got her scuba certification before heading off for her initial experience with the “real ocean,” her first visit to Hawaii. The underwater beauty of corals and animal life, the colors, the currents touched something in Ostrov that she has yet to still. Nor would she want to.

Fast forward nearly 50 years. Along with other trends like Princesses, Unicorns and Pet Rocks, Mermaids began to have their day. Everyone from little girls, to big girls and their mothers seemed to have awakened to Ariel and the allure of the deep. Mermaid toys, blankets, jewelry, even pet outfits came to market.

Even more unusual, adult women could pop for $300 “seamless, neoprene/Silicone, swimmable tails.” And three and half hours south of Tallahassee, though marginally operational, there existed a venerable Florida attraction that for all the ways time had passed it by, knew that at least it had something the public could still get excited about. Weeki Wachee Springs State Park had Mermaids!

In 1947, Newt Perry had built the roadside “pull-‘um’in” in the crystal clear waters of Weeki Watchee Springs. Within its craggy underwater geography, he contrived a giant shoot called the “Tunnel” through which 35 mostly local girls would drop themselves into the water and emerge from under a stony shelf to frolic and wave at visitors behind giant plate glass windows, awing Midwestern holiday crowds at seeing “real mermaids” cavorting in the deep. And then Disney Inc. brought the whole operation to a near sputtering stop.

Yet despite the competition to the south and the mermaid vogue’s slow wane, Weeki Wachee has carried on — and parlayed a certain nostalgia into good business. Today Junior Mermaid camps and Sirens of the Deep camps, for those over 30, are $450 Sold Out affairs. From April to October, two-day “camps” are organized by former Weeki Wachee mermaids who mentor and coach those whose fantasies might have only grown over the years. Jo Ostrov, one of eight in each class, says the oldest woman in her camp group was 80.

“It was wonderful,” enthuses Ostrov. “I had practiced my dolphin kicks in the pool for a month before I went so my stomach muscles were ready! The hardest part really, was getting into the mermaid tail and hopping backwards on the deck to get into the water.” But once in, she says she found her joy. With clear spring water rushing from beneath the earth from a vent the size of a car, the water is 72 degrees.

“It feels wonderful when you first enter, but for every 45 minutes you spend in the water, you loose three degrees of body temperature,” said Ostrov. The amateur mermaids, all in their confining tails, spent four such sessions in the water each day practicing their “underwater pinwheels, backward dolphins, and flower swimming.”

Ostrov says that though campers don’t learn to use the long oxygen tubes reserved for the professional mermaids who are putting on shows right beside the campers, they did master keeping their eyes open for long periods, wearing a constant beatific smile, and slowly letting air out of their mouths so as not to pop to the surface in an unmermaid-like eruption.

“It was so definitely a delight,” says Jo Ostrov, who in the future yearns to take a granddaughter or two back to Weeki Watchee to wiggle into a tail. “Swimming with the ancient white flounders that live at the bottom of the springs, being shadowed by the huge turtles who seem to love to spend time with the “mermaids” was wonderful.”

And for Jo Ostrov, committed water person, it seems a basic bucket-list item has been checked off. One can perhaps even hear her humming the signature song of the mermaids of Weeki Wachee, a tongue-in-cheek, but very heart-felt, “I’ve Got the World by the Tail… sittin’ on a rainbow…” And in her case, it would very definitely be true.

152,Man claims Deltona wastewater plant noise keeps him from sleeping,"DELTONA —Keith Lawhun envisioned a quiet, semi-rural lifestyle when he purchased several acres of property near the city's border with unincorporated Osteen in 2007.

He had dreams of developing a residential community for people with physical disabilities. Lawhun hasn't had use of his arms since he was in his early 20s. He had Hodgkin's disease at 13, and the amount of radiation he received caused significant damage. While he didn't let it slow him down, he's seen how disabilities can make the people who have them feel out of place.

But Lawhun's idyllic plans have not developed. Shortly after he moved onto his property on Keelhaul Road, the city of Deltona purchased 52 acres of land next door, the future site of a wastewater treatment plant.

The wastewater plant went into operation in the spring of 2016. Lawhun claims it's so noisy it interferes with his sleep. And when the wind blows the wrong way, the stench is unavoidable.

""I'm supposed to be able to enjoy the outdoors and indoors of life here after they built the plant as I did before,"" Lawhun said while standing in his yard on a recent night, the wastewater plant humming loudly in the background. ""The crickets that you hear? That's what I should be hearing.""

The 60-year-old unsuccessfully sued the city in 2017 — the third legal action he's taken against Deltona related to the property. Lawhun's attorneys, George Trovato and Tanner Andrews, are working on an appeal, which they expect to file this month, court records show. Lawhun and his lawyers assert the city is violating its own noise ordinance with the plant, as well as the Florida Administrative Code's chapter on domestic wastewater facilities.

But Lawhun has nearly given up on finding the peace and quiet that once existed when he traveled down Keelhaul Road — a pine tree- and palmetto-lined dirt road where lightning bugs make appearances. He his wife, Emma, hope to find eventual solitude on a rural property they purchased in Kentucky.

With years gone by and about $30,000 he estimates he's spent fighting the city, Lawhun hopes to win his appeal, sell his property, write a book, and move to a place where development is harder to find.

Sound expectations

Lawhun's property is zoned agricultural, but it's also where he and his wife live. According to Deltona's city code, ""all premises containing habitually occupied sleeping quarters shall be considered residential use.""

The couple's bedroom is on the end of the house closest to the wastewater plant. Before going to bed, they turn on the exhaust fan in their nearby bathroom in an effort to drown out the plant's sharp humming.

Deltona spokesman Lee Lopez said city officials wouldn't comment for this story, citing the ongoing litigation.

But according to Deltona ordinances, sound level limits for residential property are set at 60 decibels from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. and 55 decibels from 10:01 p.m. to 6:59 a.m. That's about the sound level of a normal conversation from 3 feet away, according to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Agency.

In contrast, the wastewater plant resides on a parcel that also is zoned agricultural. There, the city sound limit can be 75 decibels at all times. That's somewhere between classroom chatter and a freight train at 100 feet, according to OSHA.

Lawhun hired sound expert Dave Parzych as part of his most recent legal effort. According to Parzych, noise from the plant often exceeds 55 decibels on Lawhun's property, and levels inside of the couple's bedroom are typically 40-plus decibels. That's about the sound of a soft whisper from 5 feet away, according to OSHA.

Parzych, founder, president and principal acoustic consultant of Power Acoustics, Inc., monitored Lawhun's property for 24 hours on June 5, 2018. Lawhun left the property for that period so as to not contribute to any sound readings.

""What we found was the sound exceeded the city of Deltona noise ordinance for residential properties relatively frequently, and inside his home the sound was well exceeding what would typically be thought of as an annoying sound by the World Health Organization,"" said Parzych, who has testified in several dozen cases related to sound.

Levels in a bedroom should be less than 30 decibels for a person to get good quality sleep, according to the World Health Organization.

During one of a reporter's visits, noise on Lawhun's property standing outside at 9 p.m. from the wastewater plant ranged from 56 to 62 decibels, according to Lawhun's digital sound meter.

Human perception of sound is such that every time there's an increase of 10 decibels, the noise seems twice as loud, Parzych said.

In Lawhun's lawsuit, he requested the city operate the wastewater plant in a manner that would not produce noise greater than 55 decibels at any time; that it not emit sounds from motors, generators and alarms between the hours of 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.; that it not make noise louder than the average volume of conversation at the property boundary; and that it not emit sound that violates the Florida Administrative Code.

The Florida Administrative Code's chapter on domestic wastewater facilities was included in the permit the city received from the state Department of Environmental Protection. In part, it states, ""new treatment plants and modifications to existing plants shall be designed and located on the site so as to minimize adverse effects resulting from odors, noise, aerosol drift and lighting."" Also, treatment plants ""shall not cause odor, noise, aerosol drift or lighting in such amounts or at such levels that they adversely affect neighboring residents, in commercial or residential areas, so as to be potentially harmful or injurious to human health or welfare or unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or property.""

In October 2016, the Department of Environmental Protection noted in an inspection report summary that Deltona's wastewater plant had a minor out-of-compliance issue because of a ""rising intermittent cycling noise"" that could be deemed offensive.

In February 2017, Matt Doan, the city's public works director at the time, emailed an environmental specialist with the Department of Environmental Protection about the various efforts the city made to reduce or manage noise at the wastewater plant after it was designed. Those efforts included rotating the generator 180 degrees so the exhaust would face away from Lawhun's home, changing the generator exercise start time and changing how often the air release valve blows.

Lawhun and his attorneys contend those efforts didn't improve things.

Parzych also said that while the wastewater treatment plant doesn't exceed the city's sound limits every second of the day, it does exceed them some of the time, and even when it's not louder than the limits, often it's barely under them.

""The problem that I see with this is that noise ordinances are put in place to be protective of the people, and what they (the city of Deltona) have done is interpret the ordinance to be protective of the noise maker,"" Parzych said.

B. Scott George, an attorney with Fowler, O'Quinn, Feeney and Sneed, P.A., the Orlando-based law firm representing the city, argued in a January 2019 memorandum that Lawhun's claims ""are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.""

Res judicata, according to Cornell Law School, is ""a matter that has been adjudicated by a competent court and may not be pursued further by the same parties.""

Lawhun's attorney Tanner Andrews said the city is arguing that Lawhun should've raised his noise issue with the wastewater plant in an earlier lawsuit he filed in January 2016 against Deltona regarding access to an easement that connects both the plant and Lawhun's property to 11th Avenue, which in turn connects with State Road 415. The issue with that argument, Andrews said, is the plant wasn't fully operating at that time, so Lawhun had no idea the level of noise that wastewater plant would emit at that time.

The final judgment in the 2016 easement case, which was filed in November 2018, was that the city couldn't block Lawhun's access to 11th Avenue at any time, court records show.

George also argues in the memorandum defending the city that the wastewater plant's noise is reasonable under common law nuisance doctrine, and Lawhun hasn't properly pleaded his case for relief or proved that it's necessary the court issue a permanent mandatory injunction against the city. Additionally, George argued that the court hearing the case was lacking in subject matter jurisdiction regarding the Florida Administrative Code's chapter on domestic wastewater facilities.

But Andrews said the plant's noise is a textbook example of a nuisance.

""It's hard to live in a house where there's so much racket you can't sleep,"" Andrews said. ""The zoning doesn't change the fact that it's producing way too much noise and thereby interfering with Mr. Lawhun's use of his property.""

In February, Volusia County Court Judge Christopher Kelly denied one of the three counts in the lawsuit and granted the city's motion for involuntary dismissal of the other two. Kelly said he wasn't sure res judicata applied in the nuisance case and was basing his ruling on Lawhun carrying the burden of persuasion, which Kelly didn't feel was met, according to court transcripts.

""I have no doubts whatsoever that Mr. Lawhun's use of the property has been disturbed by the building of the water treatment plant there,"" Kelly said, according to court transcripts. ""The question is, does it rise to the level of inducements and such that the law would support this court issuing a mandatory injunction directing the city to take certain steps?""

He said, they said

Lawhun said he knew when he purchased his property in April 2007 that the city was considering purchasing an adjacent parcel for a wastewater plant. He also said the city told him if the plant was constructed, it would be some distance from Lawhun's property, with plenty of trees in between.

While the agricultural zoning of the city's property allows for water treatment plants, the structure should ""in the absence of an appropriate natural vegetation screen, be visually screened from adjoining properties ... with an appropriate fence, decorative masonry or plant material,"" according to Detona's city code.

The small amount of vegetation the city planted between the wastewater plant and Lawhun's property does nothing to mitigate the treatment plant's noise, Parzych said.

""You have to have several hundred feet of trees that are mature, dense trees before you get any substantial noise reduction from buffering and vegetation,"" Parzych testified, according to court transcripts.

Parzych said the layout of the treatment facility was ""poorly designed,"" and ""there's things that could've been done to mitigate the noise."" But ""any time you put in mitigation, there's a cost associated with it.""

George, the city's attorney in the case, said if the city made efforts to lessen the sound just so Lawhun can enjoy his property, it could potentially open the city up to regulatory issues, court records show.

Trovato, who previously worked for the city, said the frequency of the sound has increased with the elevated usage of the plant.

""Nobody really cares at this point about what's going on,"" Trovato said. ""And since it's only one neighbor out in the woods, it's like 'maybe he'll just get tired and go away.'""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190511/man-claims-deltona-wastewater-plant-noise-keeps-him-from-sleeping?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T11:11:35Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
154,Suspected gambling business near Bunnell raided by deputies,"Same business received a cease-and-desist letter in November 2018 after owner was suspected of running a gambling operation, sheriff says

Acting on a tip from their own sheriff, deputies raided a suspected electronic gambling business Friday, seizing five machines and an undisclosed amount of cash, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

No arrests have been made, but the business is being investigated as a possible illegal gambling house, deputies said.

While on patrol a few months ago, Sheriff Rick Staly responded to Dakota Joe's Senior Entertainment Center, 2245 S. Old Dixie Highway, for a call for service, Sheriff's Office spokesman Brittany Kershaw said.

While working the call, Staly ""noticed some suspicious activity that resembled electronic gambling,"" Kershaw wrote in a media release Saturday.

The Sheriff's Office's Special Investigation Unit conducted various undercover operations at Dakota Joes and discovered ""gaming devices in the establishment that pay winners in money,"" Kershaw said. A search warrant was obtained and it was served Friday night.

On Nov. 1, 2018, the business was served with a cease-and-desist letter after an armed robbery took place there a few days earlier, according to the Sheriff's Office. Detectives said the gambling activities stopped for a while, but started up again.

Staly said internet cafes are illegal and ""often become targets for crimes,"" like the armed robbery that occurred last October. He also said the operators of Dakota Joe's were given ""fair warning the first time.""

Kershaw did not identify the owner or owners in her media release.

Law enforcement agencies in Flagler and Volusia counties have a long history of shutting down suspected gambling operations. Earlier this month, two internet cafes — PrintCo in South Daytona and Print Planet in Deltona — were shut down by the Volusia County Sheriff's Office. During those two raids, a total of 184 machines were seized, deputies said.

Last month, two people were charged with felonies in connection with suspected gambling operations near Ormond Beach. Those charges were filed a couple weeks after deputies raided three businesses on Hand Avenue.

Kershaw said Saturday that not only owners of gambling houses are liable for criminal charges in Florida, but employees and customers may also be criminally charged.

155,'Wimbledon of pickleball' a step closer in Holly Hill,"HOLLY HILL — Pickleball players and fans on Friday cheered the first symbolic step toward construction of a state-of-the-art complex devoted to the sport that could transform Hollyland Park into a Pickleball Field of Dreams.

“I talk a lot of being Holly Hill proud,” Holly Hill Mayor Chris Via told a crowd of roughly 100 pickleball devotees gathered for a groundbreaking at the park across from Holly Hill City Hall. “But this is the type of project I’m really proud of.”

Wielding golden shovels, city officials were joined by the project’s financial backers and other pickleball fanatics to turn over the first dirt for a 24-court complex that would become the second-largest in the state.

To be called ""Pictona,"" a name melding of pickleball and Daytona, the project is expected to draw visitors from across the country for tournaments showcasing the popular sport that’s a cross between tennis and ping-pong.

“Not only should it make me proud and the citizens of Holly Hill proud, but it should make the whole Greater Daytona Beach area proud that this, the Wimbledon of pickleball, will be in our backyard,’” Via said.

The occasion also included an informal demonstration of the sport, showcasing the skills of championship-caliber players who rallied for points by slapping a perforated plastic ball with skillet-sized paddles on existing tennis courts at City Hall.

Across the street, Pictona is planned to occupy two-thirds of the 25-acre Hollyland Park at 1082 Ridgewood Ave., just south of LPGA Boulevard.

The city agreed in December to contribute $1 million in community redevelopment area (CRA) funds to the Hollyland Park project, a development also funded by a private investment of $3 million by pickleball enthusiasts Rainer and Julie Martens of Ormond Beach, among those on hand for Friday’s ceremony.

Upon its completion, scheduled for spring 2020, Pictona would rank as the second-largest pickleball center in Florida, trailing only a 58-court facility in Naples that recently attracted some 10,000 players and fans from across the country to the U.S. Open Pickleball Championship in April.

There, Collier County commissioners have extended an original three-year contract signed in 2016 to host the event through 2021.

Proponents of the Holly Hill project think that the courts and accompanying amenities in Hollyland Park could generate similar interest.

“Maybe not that big,” Rainer Martens, 76, said before Friday’s event. “We want to host tournaments, but not to the extent that it takes away from the local players. We think that we can be a strong regional center and we think that will bring people in from all over.”

‘Biggest sport that’s going’

The potential for the new pickleball complex to attract visitors was hailed this week by leaders of the area’s tourism and hotel industries.

“I’ve been screaming and yelling at people for a long time about how big pickleball has become,” said Bob Davis, president and CEO of the Lodging & Hospitality Association of Volusia County. “You can’t get on a court in Daytona Beach or Holly Hill or anywhere in Volusia County.

“It is the biggest sport that’s going,” Davis said. “I know a city in Wisconsin where they get 20,000 or 30,000 people for tournaments. This is a huge, huge benefit for Volusia County and Holly Hill, one of the major sports in the United States and all over the world.”

That enthusiasm was echoed by Lori Campbell Baker, executive director of the Daytona Beach Area Convention & Visitors Bureau.

“We know that pickleball is a growing sport that appeals to all ages, and that folks will happily travel to compete,” Baker said. “The Holly Hill complex is an exciting addition to the destination. It will be able to host tournaments, and we look forward to promoting them as part of our growing sports offerings.”

Invented in Seattle, Washington in 1965, pickleball is played with a solid paddle made of wood or composite materials and a perforated polymer ball that resembles a Wiffle ball.

In 2018, pickleball was played by 3.1 million people nationally, a 12 percent increase over 2017, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association.

In Volusia County, pickleball’s popularity is evident from the crowds at area courts such as the ones at Lula M. McElroy Park in Daytona Beach Shores. Most mornings, there are dozens of players, a combination of residents and tourists, on 10 courts so full that wait time is typically 10 to 15 minutes.

READ: ‘Wimbledon of Pickleball’: Holly Hill could get 24 courts

It’s that demand that prompted area pickleball fans to pursue developing the Holly Hill project. Supporters include members of Pickleball Daytona at Holly Hill, a 375-member strong not-for-profit group of pickleball enthusiasts incorporated last year. Many of them attended Friday’s event, dressed in matching blue T-shirts.

In addition to the two dozen pickleball courts, including eight covered ones, plans for Hollyland Park call for indoor and outdoor spaces for bocce ball, shuffleboard and ping pong.

A members-only clubhouse would include a pickleball pro shop, a lounge with computers where players could review videos of their play, a classroom, shower and locker facilities.

Plans also call for a restaurant called “The Kitchen” that would include views of the courts as well as skybox viewing areas overlooking six of the covered courts. Additionally, a community garden and senior activity center would be run by the city as a free public resource.

The largest of the park’s existing baseball fields would remain, according to the city’s plan.

In Flagler County, pickleball fever extends into Palm Coast, where the city recently increased the number of pickleball courts at Holland Park, the city's largest and oldest park.

Palm Coast also will begin a $525,000 project in June to build six new pickleball courts at Ralph Carter Park, 1385 Rymfire Drive, across town from Holland Park. The new courts will be added east of the parking lot and north of the soccer fields and have five entrances so players won’t have to walk behind games as they’re being played.

A 20-foot ball stop, in the form of a webbed fence, will be built to separate the new pickleball courts from the existing soccer fields. The Ralph Carter Park courts are expected to be ready by late 2019.

A good fit

In addition to its potential to draw visitors, the game’s popularity with older folks is a good fit with an aging demographic in Volusia and Flagler counties, based on Census statistics.

READ: Volusia and Flagler are aging rapidly. What does that mean for the area?

The county’s median age of 46.4 is increasing at double the pace of the United States in this decade, according to the U.S. Census’ 2017 American Community Survey. In Flagler County, the population is even older, with a median age of 50.3.

In Holly Hill, where the median age of 45.6 is three years older than the state’s, the prospect of crowded pickleball courts became a promising option after the city’s youth baseball programs were unable to attract enough young people to keep them operating.

When completed, Pictona will be owned by the city while the clubhouse, pickleball courts and restaurant will be run by the Martens, who will lease them for $1 a year.

The couple is responsible for covering the costs of the leased facilities, with the exception of utilities. Because the couple intends to operate the complex as a not-for-profit operation, the clubhouse and pickleball courts would be exempt from taxes. After a few years, the couple plan to turn the operation of the courts, clubhouse and restaurant over to Pickleball Daytona at Holly Hill.

Eventually, the Martens hope that the complex will attract young people interested in pickleball.

“I’m hoping that it will inspire kids to bring their parents along and make it a family event,” said Julie Martens, 69. “It’s not just for us old folks.”",https://www.news-journalonline.com/sports/20190511/wimbledon-of-pickleball-step-closer-in-holly-hill?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T05:41:27Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
158,"Action 9 helped two local families recover $22,000","0 Action 9 helped two local families recover $22,000

ORLANDO, Fla. - Action 9 helped two local families recover $22,000.

Just days after buying a puppy, a Rockledge woman found out it was not fit to sell, and the dog could not be saved.

“She's licking your face and I feel, I'm about to kill her and I love her,” Allison Navigato said.

Navigato had to euthanize her silver lab puppy days after buying it from Petland in Waterford Lakes.

Then she said the store refused to cover most of her losses, which included more than $6,000 to buy the puppy and vet bills.

Navigato contacted Action 9.

“You guys let others know what's going on. You raised attention to it,” Navigato said.

Todd Ulrich’s investigation found similar complaints were sent to the Better Business Bureau and Florida's Attorney General.

Two weeks after Action 9’s story aired, Petland sent the couple a $6,400 check. That was all they were asking for.

“It's not like they're giving us extra money, they're just making us whole again,” Navigato said.

Action 9 also helped a Palm Bay with a contractor issue.

Rafael Del Toro said he has a lot of damage on his roof. 17 months after Hurricane Irma, he can finally get a new roof.

But not from the company he first hired to do the job.

Del Toro paid Armadillo Roofing in Melbourne nearly $17,000 as a deposit for a new metal roof.

Weeks then months passed, and nothing happened.

“Then I started making phone calls. Hey, where is my roof?” Del Toro said.

He said they kept promising that he was next. After waiting for seven months he turned to Action 9.

“I said, I need help and that's when I decided to give your organization a call,” Del Toro said.

Action 9 found Armadillo Roofing had similar BBB complaints involving deposits for work not done.

Ulrich contacted company managers about Del Toro’s missing deposit. About a month later, he picked up refund checks for nearly $17,000.

“I'm glad you guys are listening to a small little voice in the wilderness,” Del Toro said.

Armadillo Roofing did not say what caused months in delays.

With any new roof contract, pay a minimal deposit, and try to include a completion date in the contract.

159,Former Blue Wahoos manager Pat Kelly awaits flashback as Chattanooga skipper,"CLOSE Blue Wahoos honor manager Pat Kelly, celebrate 2017 championship season Bill Vilona/bvilona@pnj.com

In preparing for Thursday night’s game, Chattanooga Lookouts manager Pat Kelly took a quick glance ahead at the next opponent’s roster.

It was the one presenting an emotional connection. The franchise he spent three memorable seasons managing.

“This will be different, for sure,” Kelly said, laughing, the former Blue Wahoos manager.

While he has no relationship with any current Pensacola players or coaches, Kelly and his pitching coach Danny Darwin recognize how fate presents a unique dynamic.

After last year’s swap of affiliations, 13 former Lookouts players now in Pensacola will reconnect Saturday against Chattanooga to begin a five game road series. Kelly and Darwin will manage against the franchise they once celebrated success. The Lookouts will be in Pensacola on Aug. 13-17.

On Sept. 8, 2017, Kelly and Darwin were doused with champagne at Blue Wahoos Stadium, after the Cincinnati Reds’ former Double-A affiliate won a Southern League co-championship.

The team sharing the title in that hurricane-shortened postseason? The Lookouts, then the Minnesota Twins affiliate.

“I think for both Danny and myself, it will be a strange feeling,” said Kelly about the upcoming series at Chattanooga’s AT&T Stadium. “I think we’ve been in the game long enough, been traded and fired enough, that we’ve done this before. But it’s definitely different.

“We had a great seven-year run (as Reds affiliate) in Pensacola and enjoyed every minute of it. Especially the three years I was there. And now it’s the Twins turn to enjoy Pensacola and hopefully we can come into Chattanooga (this season) and have some fun.”

Adding to the scenario, Kelly managed the Chattanooga Lookouts 25 years ago (1993-94) when they were a Reds affiliate during a 21-year period.

After being named the Blue Wahoos’ third manager in franchise history in December 2014, Kelly steered the ball club to its greatest run of success. The Blue Wahoos reached the playoffs each year, culminating in 2017 with a trophy and championship rings.

During those three seasons, he developed lasting friendships and enjoyed a stadium providing proximity to connect with fans.

“It was just fun to come to the ballpark every day,” said Kelly, 63, a Santa Maria, Calif. native. “It was a great facility, a great city, and the fans who came to the ballpark made it all worthwhile.

“They were very supportive. I made a lot of friends.”

Entering the weekend series against the South division-leading Blue Wahoos, Kelly sees it as a gauge for his North Division team.

“Just glancing at (Blue Wahoos) roster, some of the names are familiar,” Kelly said. “I know just following baseball, they have a lot of the top prospects for the Twins.

“And obviously, looking at the standings, they are off to a great start. So I think it is going to be a really good challenge for us.

The Lookouts (17-14 before Thursday’s game) had a sluggish start, losing seven of eight games, beginning in mid-April. They have since won the past two series, taking four of five games each time.

“We got off to a really bad start with some young players. But we really hit our stride the last couple weeks. I am kinda looking forward to (facing Blue Wahoos), because I think it’s a great challenge for our young kids, just to see how far we have advanced in this first month and a half.

“We came into the year with a lot of questions with the pitching staff. So we felt like it was basically trying to get everyone’s feet wet and see how we did. We split our first two series, which I felt we were fortunate to do.

“Then Mississippi came in and knocked our socks off… they beat us four of five. I think it was eye opening for our players.”

The Lookouts were tied as of Thursday with the Tennessee Smokies for the best team batting average (.255) in the Southern League. Several of their batters among the league’s top 50 – Jose Siri, T.J. Friedl, Gavin LaValley – were in Pensacola last season.

“We are going to try to prove the opposite of what we did in Pensacola… that you can win with offense and give up a lot of runs,” said Kelly, jokingly. “But this is a much better park to hit in (Chattanooga) from an offensive standpoint.

“I think our pitching is starting to settle down. Having Danny working with those guys, they get better every start and the bullpen is starting to solidify a little bit.”

After seeing so many of the players he managed reach the major leagues in recent seasons, Kelly returned last year himself as a bench coach for the Reds. He was in the dugout with then-interim manager Jim Riggleman, the Blue Wahoos manager in their inaugural 2012 season.

Both were elevated after the Reds opted to fire Bryan Price just 18 games into the 2018 season. Riggleman is now bench coach for the New York Mets. After the Reds chose David Bell as new manager and he hired his staff, Kelly opted for a Double-A return in the Reds organization to help players advance.

“(Last year) was fantastic for me,” Kelly said. “It was a great experience to be exposed to the big leagues and get exposed with players who had played for me. You are seeing through their struggles. And to work for Jim Riggleman was fantastic.

“What a terrific man, I love the way he runs a ballgame. He is always two steps ahead of the other manager. It was very educational for me… being able to sit next to a guy who I felt like was one step ahead of me a lot of times.

“So I felt like I got a lot out of it.”

He’s hoping for the same in a new situation this year.

ZEPHYRHILLS, Fla. (WFLA) - She's only seven-years-old, but Anastasia Sanchez already knows what it takes to be a leader.

The first grader at Woodland Elementary in Zephyhills is a police chief.

For a day, at least.

And she's good at it.

Just ask the official chief at the Zephyrhills Police Department.

""She is poised, smart and alert to her surroundings,"" said Chief Derek Brewer.

On Thursday morning, Anastasia took the oath to protect and serve as part of the agency's ""Chief for a Day"" program.

Then, she got right to work.

""She was shy for the first couple of minutes, but it didn't take long for her to start taking charge,"" Chief Brewer told WFLA. ""We love getting young people interested at an early age. That's the purpose of this program. They enjoy it, and it builds good will.""

This young lady won over the hearts of a few special members of the agency.

The K9 team.

""She expressed playing with the dogs was her favorite part of the day,"" the chief told us.

Chief Brewer said he enjoyed having Anastasia lead the force.

""She'll make a great police chief someday,"" he said.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pasco-county/photos-7-year-old-becomes-police-chief/1992728913,2019-05-09T21:09:07Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
162,Doctor: Take care of yourself while caring for baby,"When a new baby comes home, the caring, the worrying and the sleepless nights can make it easy for new mothers to put their own health on the back burner.

Adjusting to a new life and responsibilities can seem very overwhelming, especially for first-time moms.

“It’s very easy for a lot of women to feel overcome with feelings of anxiety -- being overwhelmed, feeling sad -- and that’s a very common response. It’s actually called postpartum blues,” said Dr. Jeffrey Chapa, a women’s health expert at Cleveland Clinic. “We see postpartum blues for the first couple of weeks after a delivery, whether it’s a vaginal delivery or C-section. It’s very normal.”

Chapa said many times, emotions that new mothers experience when they return home with a new baby are the result of fluctuating hormones.

He recommends new mothers talk openly about these feelings, either with their partner, their doctor or a friend.

But if the feelings persist or if the bad days still outnumber the good days after a few weeks, it’s time to call the doctor because it could be a sign of postpartum depression.

Unlike postpartum blues, postpartum depression is not short-term and requires some form of treatment, such as behavioral therapy or medication.

Chapa said it’s also common for new mothers to experience some pain after delivery, especially if labor was long or difficult.

However, women who experience new symptoms, such as swelling or pain (in) the legs, or extreme shortness of breath, should call their doctor.

Also, new guidelines recommend mothers have a follow-up visit with their doctor within three weeks following delivery and then again at six weeks.

Adjusting to life as a new mother is challenging, therefore, Chapa said it’s important for women to enlist some help.

“It’s very important that you try not to do all these things alone if you can,” he said. “It’s important to get help from your spouse, your family, whomever is available, friends. Most people are willing to help and most people like to be around new babies and are willing to help.”

163,Rev up the fire truck: Red grouper and gag grouper are biting offshore,"CLOSE A Southwest Florida couple saw a tiger shark eat a grouper 10 miles off the coast of Port Charlotte on Sunday, July 29, 2018. Stephanie Morris and Justin Hawkins

Mosquito Lagoon: Capt. Jon Lulay of Mosquito Lagoon Redfish Charters in Titusville has reported good fishing conditions for redfish and trout the past week. Lulay's anglers are tossing Slayer Inc SST XL paddle tails in smokin' mullet and chicken off the chain colors rigged on a Mission Fishin' 1/8 or 1/4-ounce jig head. The fish have been in shallow water, so use stealth to move into areas where the fish may be foraging for small crustaceans. Black drum can still be caught in deeper water and near the channel edges on shrimp or cut bait.

Offshore: The bottom fishing has outpaced the trolling for many anglers. On the reefs in 110-160 feet of water, the grouper bite has been good. Red grouper up to 14 pounds, gag grouper up to 25 pounds and throwback red snapper are providing a lot of action for anglers. Use dead sardines and 80- to 100-pound fluorocarbon leaders to find bites. Trolling has been better in 200-300 feet, but the dolphin bite has been scattered, along with a few sailfish. When a dolphin is caught, however, it seems to be a good one. Several reports of 30-pound fish have been coming in.

Surf: Will this be the weekend the surf fishing finally returns? One can only hope. To the south, there have been some reports of cleaner water with fewer racks of seaweed. Whiting fishing will be good during the end of the incoming tide, but that is also when the grass could be at its worst.

Indian River Lagoon: Catches like flounder, black drum and speckled trout are leading the reports in the lagoon this week. For flounder, use a fish finder rig with small baits like mud minnows, if they can be found, or small pinfish or shrimp. Fish along rocky shorelines and around structure where the flounder like to lie in sandy areas with a little current. Berkley Gulp! jigs or D.O.A. Cal jigs with curly tails also work well on flounder. Black drum are taking cut bait and shrimp in many of the same areas and near channels. The speckled trout fishing is best at first light on the shallow flats or near the shorelines. Use a topwater plug to get bites.

Sebastian Inlet: Redfish, snook and black drum continue to drive the angler interest here. Fish the bottom with bait on jig heads or sliding sinker rigs during the change of the tides for the best chance to catch one. Slot fish are hard to come by. In the top of the water column, cast spoons or chugger lures to catch bites from bluefish and Spanish mackerel, which are still hanging around in decent numbers. The end of the incoming tide has been the best time to find them.

Freshwater: The full moon is on its way, and when it gets here, the bass may still be hanging around the edges trying to spawn. Live bait will get bites in the bigger lakes and St. Johns River. Bluegill fishing is still pretty good everywhere. It is also a good time to cast net or bowfish for tilapia, which are on beds in shallow water.

<p>Sands, who is known on YouTube as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV40x16xp-hISG9bl6vGDVA"" target=""_blank"">Florida Diver</a>, said they were about 200 yards offshore, south of Anglin's Fishing Pier, when they noticed the shark was laying on her belly. He was wearing a GoPro video camera. </p>

<p>""Other times when I've approached nurse sharks, they like to sleep under the coral reef, so I thought at first she is just resting,"" Sands said. ""And as I got closer, she tried to leave. And when she couldn't, that's when I realized that her behavior was different.""</p>

<p>The shark was entangled on a fishing line and was bound to the reef. Sands said the shark was wedged in and the line was wrapped around her tail and pectoral fins.</p>

<p>""She was stuck,"" Sands said. ""I dont know how long she had been there, but she had no energy left at all.""</p>

<p>The two divers cut the fishing line and pulled out a couple pounds of fishing weights and hooks. They freed her. Sands said he was feeling lucky. He thinks the shark would be dead without their help.  </p>

<p>""I'm really happy that we saved her,"" Sands said. ""It was the best day ever. We got her loose and she swam away ...

Buy Photo New Melbourne football head coach Tony Rowell watches his players during spring football practice at Melbourne High School. (Photo: Craig Bailey/FLORIDA TODAY)

Tony Rowell is new to the head coaching position for Melbourne high football, but he isn't new to the school or to the program.

Rowell, a 1987 MHS graduate, and his wife Denise, another graduate of the school, have sent five children to the school, including some of its top athletes during their careers. One more has yet to reach high school age but is on his way.

Rowell, himself, was a Bulldogs football player who carried his career to the University of Florida and then to the NFL as a 1992 sixth-round draft pick of the Raiders, then based in Los Angeles.

Now a business owner, he's been involved in local youth football for 15 years, and he served a two-year stint as an assistant at Holy Trinity. Although it's not been unusual in other sports, he's now blazing a trail along with one other Brevard high school football coach as being a community coach for a program.

New Brevard head football coaches

Spring practice underway and the exhibition game at Astronaut coming on May 17, Rowell spoke with FLORIDA TODAY about his new job.

Q: You've been a businessman. Have there been any big surprises in this new role of running a program?

Rowell: No big surprises. The hardest thing I’m still trying to do right now is get coaches that are teachers at this school to be with the kids every day. Obviously one of the things I haven’t been able to accomplish is getting coaches on campus, which is what I’m working on right now. There’s a couple of guys I’m trying to get worked in, and if that happens, we’ll be very successful soon.

(What I want is g)uys to be here with the kids all day, every day. As of now, we come here once a week for lunch as a coaching staff, or I try to come by two or three times a week, but I want more.

Q: What have you inherited?

Rowell: I’ve inherited a good group of kids. These kids are great. We’ve had a couple move in here. They’ve actually come to play and help us out immediately, which is what we needed. Just excited to be out here and continuing to teach these kids.

Q: What have been your top priorities so far?

Rowell: Number one, getting the offensive coordinator and getting him everything he needs and finding the right people to play offense for us. He’s done a great job there.

Most recently, Joe Cohen has taken over as full-time defensive coordinator, and that was great. They came together great, came together as a family. Looking forward to May 17.

CLOSE New Melbourne High football coach Tony Rowell talks about getting students out for football. Brian McCallum, FLORIDA TODAY

Q: Who are your coaching influences?

Rowell: I came from the Galen Hall era at the University of Florida and then was fortunate enough to have Coach Spurrier come in and got to see the difference of the way Coach Hall ran practice and the way Coach Spurrier ran practice.

I try to do it more similar to Coach Spurrier, where we have time periods. Everything’s on a clock. We try to accomplish a lot of repetition every day and be organized.

By having a play clock every day, it acts as if you’re in game time. Once that clock hits zero, all the coaches know that’s the end of that period and we’ve got to move to the next period. They have to learn to get better at those periods, because it’s just like a game. They do end, and you can’t put any seconds back on the clock.

Q: What style of play will people see from Melbourne High now?

Rowell: We’re going to try to throw the ball around more than you’ve seen at Mel High in the past. Hopefully we’ll get more athletes that want to come and play wide receiver for us.

Then, our defense has changed a little bit, changing the fronts around a little bit from what we’ve had here. Hopefully it’s successful.

Q: How do you keep talented players from leaving the school to play for other programs? Any good signs so far?

Rowell: There’s great signs of what we have here and want to come here. It’s a little difficult. Melbourne High School and Viera are two of the only closed schools, whereas it seems like we’ve been the junior college for these other high schools in Brevard County.

That’s why I want to hire all these great coaches, to help them along to be young men so they don’t want to leave, so they want to stay in this program. Over the past, as you can see, seems like kids come here for two years and then they’re off to other schools in the county. We’re trying our best and will continue to promote Melbourne High School as the place to be.

Q: What’s the potential here?

Rowell: I think the potential is phenomenal. I think this year we’ll be competitive, and then over the next two or three years, if we (can keep top players in the program), I think you’ll see Melbourne High School go deep into the playoffs.

TAMPA (WFLA) - A Florida couple is thanking social media for reconnecting their preschool love.

Today reports Austin Tatman and Natalie Crowe were best friends when they were five-year-old, but lost touch after Natalie moved from Florida to Connecticut.

They hadn't seen each other in 12 years, but finding Tatman's name in her mother's address book prompted Crowe to look up Tatman on Facebook and send him a message. The random reunion led to a budding romance, which progressed to the once-prekindergarten sweethearts becoming husband and wife.

Natalie told Today, ""From the second that we met in pre-K we were best friends,"" Crowe said. ""Our parents pretty much told us that it was a very, very special bond that we shared.""

At their wedding, they re-created a childhood photo of them in a red toy jeep with a sweet picture of them together in front of a real Jeep.

172,Sen. Marco Rubio reportedly confirms Florida elections office intrusion by Russians in 2016,"ORLANDO — Sen. Marco Rubio confirmed Friday there was an intrusion into Florida’s elections systems by hackers in 2016, according to The New York Times.

Rubio, R-Fla., would not say who was behind the hacking, saying he was constrained by his position on the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the redacted version of the Mueller report released April 18 stated the FBI believes “at least one Florida county” was infiltrated with malicious software sent out by Russian intelligence agents.

Rubio’s statement contradicts the Florida secretary of state’s office, which maintained last week that its elections systems weren’t hacked. Secretary Laurel Lee also said at the time that the FBI hadn’t told the state which county they believe was compromised.

Rubio said the information was discovered through an intelligence operation, not a criminal investigation,

“Everybody has been told what it is they need to do to protect themselves from the intrusion,” Rubio told the Times. “I don’t believe the specific victims of the intrusion have been notified. The concern was that in a number of counties across the country, there are a couple of people with the attitude of: ‘We’ve got this; we don’t need your help. We don’t think we need to do what you are telling us we need to do.’”

The hackers, were “in a position” to change voter roll information, he told the Times, but it didn’t appear they did.

Last year, then-Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., warned that Russians had gained access to Florida voter data but declined to identify which county or counties had been penetrated, saying the information was classified. No other officials backed up Nelson’s claim, including Rubio, and his opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, and national Republicans attacked Nelson for what GOP campaign emails called his “alarming claims” and “extremely reckless behavior.”

Rubio did warn repeatedly in 2016 that “state election systems are potentially vulnerable to Russian cyberattacks.”

Gov. Ron DeSantis had said at a press conference in Orlando last week that he didn’t believe any breach would have affected vote totals.

But in Miami on Thursday, according to Politico, he was critical of the FBI, telling reporters, “They won’t tell us which county it was, are you kidding me? Why would you have not said something immediately?”

DeSantis and now Sen. Scott, who defeated Nelson, will meet with the FBI in coming weeks to discuss the Russian hacking attempts on Florida counties in 2016.

Scott’s office said the FBI has reached out to him and is working on scheduling a briefing in the next few weeks. DeSantis’ office said no date has yet been set.

The report stated that in November 2016, Russian intelligence officials “sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election.”

The emails contained an attached Word document with malicious “Trojan” software that would have permitted Russian intelligence to access the infected computer. But none of the 52 Florida counties that had contracts with VR Systems, the Tallahassee company that was allegedly impersonated, has admitted to opening that document.

Volusia County elections supervisor Lisa Lewis said Thursday the office opened one of the infected emails in 2016, but not the infected attachment. Broward County Supervisor Peter Antonacci said this week the county received the email, but it was quarantined by anti-virus software and officials wouldn’t have had the opportunity to open the attachment.

Helium is the second-most abundant element in the galaxy, yet Party City is struggling to find enough of the gas to fill balloons.Balloons are big business for Party City. The company's mylar balloon sales fell 8% last quarter, dragging overall sales down 1.4% at Party City stores open at least a year. Sales would have risen if not for the Party City's balloon problems, officials with the company said Thursday.Filling balloons with helium is among the company's most profitable services, according to Barclays' Matt McClintock. Helium brings people into the store, and those customers usually buy other items instead of buying them on Amazon or at another store.But with the Earth's (and Party City's) helium supplies dwindling, potential balloon customers have been searching elsewhere for party goods.Party City officials said it will close 45 stores this year to make up for lost earnings. That's triple the number of stores the company typically closes in any given year. In a worrisome sign, almost all of those stores are profitable, according to the company. The company is closing the stores to boost overall profitability, hoping customers will shop at nearby Party City stores. It has about 900 across North America.Wither the world's helium?Earth has been running out of helium for several years. Helium is formed by the atom-smashing power of the sun and other stars. But on Earth, helium is a finite resource.The Earth holds pockets of helium buried under rock, but it's notoriously hard to capture because it floats. When drilling or fracking for natural gas, energy companies capture some helium and sell it. But helium makes up a tiny percentage of the gasses trapped under rock formations.Over the past few years, some drillers have claimed to find troves of helium buried underground, but those haven't always panned out. Party City officials said it really started feeling the pinch in August 2018.Good and bad news for Party CityThe good news for Party City is it signed an agreement with a new helium supplier. Party City believes the new supplier can help it return its balloon business back to normal starting in the summer, and it hopes the supplies will last for the next two-and-a-half years.""We believe this new source should substantially eliminate the shortfall we are experiencing,"" said Party City CEO James Harrison in a statement.The bad news is Party City said its helium shortage will continue through the spring. That's bad timing: May is a big month for balloons.""Obviously, graduation is a big season for balloons, no doubt about that,"" said Harrison on a conference call with Wall Street analysts Thursday.And once Party City gets its helium back, its new supplier will charge more than its last provider. So it will have to raise balloon-filling prices.Helium still remains cheap, and Party City doesn't expect the higher prices to hurt sales in the long run. It may also be able to eat some of that cost over time, Harrison predicted. But he said higher helium prices may be here to stay.""Over time, will helium come back down in price? Nobody knows. We'll see,"" Harrison said.Harrison cautioned, however, that the additional helium wasn't a sure thing. Party City's new supplier might believe it is sitting on a lot of helium, but it can't know for sure until it bottles and sells it.""Mother Nature will ultimately determine whether or not those fields have the adequate amount helium to reach the goals that we've set,"" Harrison said. ""We feel very comfortable that the expectations and the estimates made are solid.""Still, the stock price soared 10% Thursday because investors were pleased that Party City was able to secure another helium supplier. The stock fell 3% Friday, dragged down by the broader market.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/party-city-will-close-45-stores-because-of-global-helium-shortage/27433133,2019-05-10T17:01:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
177,"Naples Zoo celebrates 50th year as a zoo, 100th year as a garden","In Naples, 100th birthdays aren't necessarily uncommon, but they're none the less a cause for celebration, which is exactly what the Naples Zoo is doing as it marks its 100th year as a botanical garden and 50th year as a zoo.

The zoo is hosting a birthday party Saturday for Dr. Henry Nehrling, the man without whom the zoo might not exist today.

Two men with a vision (and green thumbs)

Nehrling, a botanist from Wisconsin, moved to Central Florida in the early 1900s to study and collect tropical plants. A freeze devastated his garden in 1917, so in 1919 he moved further south to Naples and purchased 13 acres along the Gordon River.

This year the Naples Zoo is celebrating 100 years as a botanical garden and 50 years as a zoo. (Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

His work thrived there and by 1925 Nehrling's collection had more than 3,000 species of tropical plants. He also helped introduce more than 300 new and beneficial plants to the United States.

Nehrling died in 1929 and for the next two decades his garden went unattended, said Tim Tetzlaff, the zoo's director of conservation.

""Basically nobody was keeping watch, nobody was paying attention, so there was a fair amount of botanical vandalism and stealing. Things that were either small enough or still in pots at the time kind of vanished,"" he said. ""That’s why we’ve got dozens of historic specimens, not thousands from that era.""

Julius Fleischmann, Jr., a philanthropist from Cincinnati, came to town in 1946 ""with his checkbook and a vision,"" Tetzlaff said. He bought Nehrling's property in 1951 and not only restored the garden to its former glory, but also expanded it.

""He added 30 more acres and also hundreds of species of birds,"" said Elaine Reed, president of Naples Historical Society. ""At one point he actually had 1,200 different species of birds.""

Fleischmann renamed the property ""Caribbean Gardens,"" a name it still bears today, and opened it to guests in 1954. Three years later he installed the famed toucan sign on U.S. 41 that welcomed visitors to the garden a few blocks away on Goodlette-Frank Road.

Fleischmann owned and operated the property until his death in 1968. A year later, the land fell into a new set of hands that would once again transform it forever.

Lawrence and Nancy Jane Tetzlaff, better known as Jungle Larry and Safari Jane, were well-known expedition leaders and zoo operators in the Midwest.

The couple visited Naples in 1967 and fell in love with Caribbean Gardens. They inquired about purchasing the property, but Fleischmann refused to sell.

Shortly after Fleischmann's death, his son, who had inherited the property, offered to lease it to the Tetzlaffs and they immediately agreed.

Work began to incorporate the Tetzlaffs' animals into the garden while preserving as much of the botanical garden as possible.

""All the original animal exhibits were put in with the removal of just one tree,"" said Tim Tetzlaff, Larry and Jane's son. ""That way it maintained the nature of what was then a 50-year-old botanical garden.""

The Tetzlaffs owned and operated the zoo until 2002 when the Fleischmann family expressed an interest in selling the 43 acres of zoo property and the nearly 120 surrounding acres.

Knowing that a buyer would most likely bulldoze the area, the Tetzlaffs asked Collier County to buy the land. In a 2004 referendum, Collier County voters overwhelming agreed to tax themselves to buy the zoo from the Fleischmann family.

Preserving the past and looking to the future

Today the zoo's staff is working to preserve the property's history and ensure that it will be around for the next 100 years.

""The most unique thing about this property is this is as close as you could get to what Naples would have looked like a long time ago,"" said Danielle Green, the zoo's director of gardens and grounds.

""I think it’s very unique in this day and age, no matter where you are in the country, that you’re able to go and visit a place on a regular basis and see plants that your great-great-grandmother would have seen at the time. I think that’s really special.""

Making a Difference: Naples Zoo striving to be a conservation leader

Green and her team care for the hundreds of plants and trees on the property, including eight Nehrling and 11 Fleischmann historic tree specimens.

“Older specimens require a little additional care, no different than that of humans or animals, so we try to pay special attention to them versus some of the younger ones,"" Green said.

Sometimes that additional care means injecting pesticides directly into the tree, said Darryl Windham, the zoo's horticultural manager.

“Some of these trees are so large when you’re trying to do pest control or even fertilizer you can’t just spray the trees,"" he said. ""It’s just not feasible and very impractical to do that.""

In addition to preserving the property's history, the zoo is also working on expansion plans.

The Naples Zoo launched a $25 million fundraising campaign in 2016 to add a flamingo/roseate spoonbill exhibit, Alligator Bay feature, Komodo dragon exhibit, South American rain forest and grasslands trail, nature and water play area for children, and education center, which will be used to host camps and programs for students from Collier and Lee counties and night lectures for adults.

More: Naples Zoo breaks ground for hospital to care for panthers, other animals

The zoo is also adding a new on-site animal hospital set to be complete in July, a welcome center and a revamped entrance that will remind visitors of the zoo's long history.

“The new entrance has an Old Florida theme, so it will recreate the entrance sign that was on U.S. 41 for all those years with the big toucan we have preserved,"" Tetzlaff said. ""So we’re connecting people with the past, but also with everything that’s new inside.""

Where: Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens, 1590 Goodlette-Frank Road

When: Saturday, May 11, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.

178,Playoff softball: Culp's 10th-inning home run sends NFC to regional finals,"The Eagles beat St. Johns Country Day 2-1 on the road, but three small-school area teams were eliminated from the postseason on Thursday night

With one extra-inning swing, North Florida Christian senior Chloe Culp reversed the feel of the past two weeks for the Eagles’ softball team.

Having lost four games in a row – including a district championship loss at Rocky Bayou – heading into Thursday’s Region 1-3A semifinal playoff game at St. Johns Country Day, a season-ending loss would have devalued all the good results NFC’s young team had produced this year.

But tied 1-1 at SJCD, Culp came up in the top of the 10th inning to face Spartans pitcher Brianna Enter, who struck out 21 batters and only walked one.

She’d already struck out Culp on the night, and Culp went down 0-2 in her final at-bat. But then the Florida State signee hammered a ball over the center-field wall, giving NFC the run it needed to pull off a 2-1 win.

“That ball got out in a hurry,” Eagles coach Dennis Gorham said. “Her first couple at-bats weren’t great. She hit a bloop that dropped in for a double. She’s down 0-2 and then just settled in. It was a perfect, easy-looking swing, and the ball still has not landed.”

As a result of the victory over District 2’s champion, NFC will now face University Christian (16-4), which beat Rocky Bayou 11-0. The Eagles had beaten the Knights handily in two regular-season meetings before getting tripped up in the district final. NFC hasn't faced UC since 2016.

WINNERS: Chiles, Wakulla, Aucilla Christian capture softball district titles

“During the losing streak, there was some passing the blame,” Gorham said. “I think it took losing to Rocky Bayou to realize we had a second chance. They bought in all week and the practices were some of the best we’ve had all year.

“From the time they got off the bus, they were energized, they cheered the whole game for each other, and they were engaged to the last out.”

NFC (12-5) got on the scoreboard first when freshman Emma Brice tripled in a run in the first inning, only to have St. Johns tie things up in the third when Maddie Wilkes took Eagles eighth-grade pitcher Maddie Mayo deep.

But the Eagles didn’t make an error during the course of the game, and Culp's home run was her 11th of the season to go with a batting average just below .700.

“After Emma, we were dry until Chloe,” Gorham said. “Nobody could get on base. The top and bottom of our lineup had struggles, but we played flawless defense. Maddie must have had six balls hit back to her and (second baseman) Hayley (Turner) had three or four.

“It was the best defensive performance we’ve had all year and the first game in a while where we played as a team.”

Now NFC is set up well to carry its newfound momentum into next Tuesday’s regional final. The Eagles haven’t been to the state tournament since 2015.

“It’s nice to win a district championship, but even if you lose you’re going to have to face tough opponents along the way to state,” Gorham said. “Our girls may have been complacent playing Rocky Bayou last time.

“But by losing to a team we believe we’re more talented than, it made us realize we have to work for everything we want. We can’t step on the field and be awarded a win. We played with a chip on our shoulder tonight, and we'll need to do it again.”

Trinity Christian 10, Florida High 0

On the road in Jacksonville for a Region 1-4A semifinal, Florida High was held to just two hits over five innings by Conquerors pitcher Bailey Cooley, who struck out four and walked one. Sophomore Addisan Langston and freshman Camryn Miller were the only Seminoles (15-12) to muster a hit.

Trinity Christian (15-8) poured things on against Florida High freshman pitcher Jaden Martinez, who gave up nine hits.

Christ’s Church 6, Aucilla Christian 4

Falling behind 6-0 at home after four innings, Aucilla Christian saw its rebuilding year come to a close with a rare early exit from the playoffs. After reaching the Class 2A state championship game in the previous five seasons, losing at home in a Region 1-2A quarterfinal was a new feeling.

Aucilla Christian (3-15) rallied with two runs in each of the fourth and sixth innings, but it wasn’t enough to overcome four errors and eight walked batters. Warriors freshmen Isabella Gray and Ali Townsend each doubled and produced two hits, and eighth-grader Lena Kimmell tripled and drove in two runs. Junior Marilee Heaps also drove in a run with a hit in the sixth.

Celia Hollis drove in three runs and hit two doubles for Christ’s Church (13-8).

Hilliard 3, Madison County 1

After unexpectedly dropping its district championship game to Lafayette, Madison County was forced to go on the road for its Region 2-1A semifinal, and that proved a fateful ending to the Cowgirls’ otherwise excellent season.

Madison fell at Hilliard (16-8) after the Flashes broke a 1-1 tie in the bottom of the sixth inning. The Cowgirls (20-6) gave up a single, walk, sacrifice fly, hit-by-pitch and run-scoring error in succession.

Senior Reese Rutherford was tagged with the loss, scattering six hits with six strikeouts across six innings. Junior third baseman Abi Annett drove in Madison’s only run in the fifth inning.

Hilliard junior pitcher Brooke Geiger only struck out one batter, but she didn’t walk anyone and limited Madison’s big bats to just three singles.

181,Dericka Lindsay's adopted mom stands trial in her death,"Grace Smith suffered severe diabetes, and sometimes the 69-year-old's legs and feet got so swollen she couldn't wear shoes or walk around her own house.

In her condition, Smith was weaker than her 9-year-old adopted daughter, the woman's attorney said, and sometimes she asked for help keeping the ""unruly girl"" under control.

Smith never intended or imagined that her attempts at discipline would lead to the child's death, Smith's attorney argued in the first day of her trial Thursday.

Smith is charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child and aggravated child abuse in connection with the October 2017 death of Dericka Chavonne Lindsey, a young girl who suffocated when her 320-pound cousin, Veronica Posey, sat on her as a form of discipline.

Veronica Posey: Woman convicted of murder, sentenced to life for sitting on child

James Smith: Man sentenced in death of adopted 9-year-old who was sat on

In her opening statements to jurors Thursday, Assistant State Attorney Amy Shea said Posey was charged with murder for what she did to Dericka, but Smith was being charged because ""she failed to do her duty as a parent and protect her child from the abuse of another person.""

Shea said that before Dericka's death, the child had threatened Grace Smith and her husband, James, with a knife and a hammer. Smith called Posey over to her Navy Point home, and when she arrived both women spanked Dericka using a belt, a ruler and a small pipe.

When the girl resisted, she was made to kneel on the floor with her torso bent forward over the seat of an arm chair, and Posey put her weight on the girl's torso. A minute or two into the ""punishment,"" Dericka said she couldn't breathe, but Posey didn't move. A little while later Dericka repeated that she couldn't breathe, and Posey got up, but at that point Dericka had already lost her pulse.

A later autopsy revealed that Lindsey had severe bruising on her buttocks that appeared to be the result of severe, repeated beatings. The medical examiner said during Posey's trial that the bruising was the worst of its type she had ever seen.

Shea said the discipline meted out against Dericka ""goes far beyond what punishment is permitted by the law,"" and she noted that although Smith was frail, ""that doesn't stop her from beating that child, and it doesn't stop her from inviting (Posey's) abuse into her home.""

Case unfolds

Initial arrest: Pensacola child dies after 325-pound adult sat on her as punishment

Charges upgraded: State upgrades charges for 2 allegedly involved in child's punishment death

Autopsy: Lindsay had bruising, brain swelling after cousin allegedly sat on her

Additional charges: Three defendants face additional child abuse charge

Audio: 911 call released from Dericka Lindsay death

Smith's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Bradley Rowe, said that Smith and her husband had been caring for Dericka for most of the girl's life and they loved her dearly. But while the Smiths was getting older and weaker, Dericka was ""getting bigger, stronger and more defiant everyday,"" he said.

Rowe said the couple trusted Posey to help them discipline Dercika because she was an evangelical minister who had children of her own, and sometimes she was able to get the 9-year-old to behave just by using the right words.

Remembering Dericka

► Community gathers to honor, remember girl allegedly killed by cousin

► Dericka Lindsay's school installs 'buddy bench' after 9-year-old's alleged abuse death

► Dericka Lindsay death: Parents, friends say girl with troubled home life was happy, bubbly

When she did resort to corporal punishment, the Smiths never thought Dericka would come to any real harm, Rowe suggested. He said the incident involving Posey and the chair happened so quickly that the Smiths didn't understand the tragic consequences until it was already too late.

""(Posey did not sit on Dericka) at the direction, encouragement, recommendation or order of Grace (Smith),"" Rowe told jurors. ""... She loved her daughter. She didn't want her daughter to die.""

Smith's trial is expected to wrap up Friday.

James Smith, who was also charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child, plead no contest to his charges and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. A jury convicted Posey of first-degree murder, and she was issued the mandatory life sentence for her role in the death.

LONDON (AP) — A BBC DJ was fired Thursday after using a picture of a chimpanzee in a tweet about the royal baby born to Meghan the Duchess of Sussex and her husband Prince Harry.

Danny Baker, who had a weekly show on BBC Radio 5 Live, tweeted Thursday that he has been fired after posting an image of a couple holding hands with a chimpanzee dressed in clothes and the caption: “Royal baby leaves hospital.”

The tweet came on Wednesday, the same day Harry and Meghan posed for photos with their first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. The tweet was seen as a racist reference to baby Archie’s heritage. His grandmother Doria Ragland is African American.

Baker, 61, said the posting had been meant as a gag, tweeting late Wednesday that it was “supposed to be (a) joke about royals vs circus animals in posh clothes but interpreted as about monkeys & race.” The post has since been deleted.

“Enormous mistake, for sure. Grotesque. Anyway, here’s to ya Archie, Sorry mate,” he tweeted.

BBC Radio 5 Live controller Jonathan Wall said in an email to staff that Baker had shown poor judgment.

“This was a serious error of judgment and goes against the values we as a station aim to embody. Danny’s a brilliant broadcaster but will no longer be presenting a weekly show with us,” Wall said.

On Thursday, Baker insisted he is not racist and attacked the BBC for its handling of the situation. He said the call to fire him “was a masterclass of pompous faux-gravity.”

When Harry was first dating Meghan, his office released a scathing letter in which he complained about sexist and racist coverage of Meghan, who at the time was starring in the TV show “Suits.”

The flap over Baker’s tweet came as Harry took a break from parental duties to travel to the Netherlands to promote the 2020 Invictus Games, an international competition he founded for injured service personnel and veterans.

Harry grinned and made funny faces for the cameras as he held up a tiny baby outfit given to him by Prince Margriet of the Netherlands.

183,Pensacola M25 Championship in full swing at Roger Scott,"CLOSE Tournament directors reflect on history of Pink Ribbon Tennis and hitting $1 million in fundraising Bill Vilona/bvilona@pnj.com

Pensacola has always been a hotbed for sports. Especially tennis, where anyone can pick up a racket and find a court.

Over the past decade, the city has been an attractive spot for up and coming future stars—the likes of top-ranked players Jack Sock and Denis Shapovalov as well as other big names have graced the clay courts of Roger Scott Tennis Center for the Pensacola Pro Futures Championship.

What began in 2010 with a $15,000 total purse, has now become a 32-men’s singles player and 16 doubles pair main draw and is a $25,000 ITF event. That makes for even better tennis.

Mayor’s Reception/Pro-Am serves event off

Now called the Pensacola M25 Championship, a mayor’s reception/pro-am gathering Monday evening kick-served the popular tourney with fun tennis, and courtside dinner after.

Mayor Grover Robinson, an integral part of bringing ten clay courts to the Scott facility nearly ten years ago, enjoyed being a part of the action with younger local players as well as visiting pros.

“I love playing in this—it’s always a great time,” Robinson said. As county commissioner, he helped make the ITF event dream a reality. “It’s good to play with these guys—they hit amazing shots. What was so exciting for me is that I played with so many of our young kids—I played twice against Maggie Eddins and once against Justin Lyons—so it’s great seeing young Pensacola kids doing so well and getting involved in tennis and playing at this kind of level. Having the ability to play this caliber tennis is definitely a benefit to them.”

Another welcome change is the tournament is now in the spring—the Futures was always hosted in the fall, with more chilly conditions.

“Getting the tournament in May is exciting,” Robinson added. “We’ve definitely got some good players out here—it’s Mother’s Day weekend, and there should be some great tennis. I’m looking forward to it. It’s just amazing.”

Matthew Segura of Orlando was the top pro in the fun exhibition, outlasting Pensacola-favorite Patrick Daciek. They both had a combined 15 points on the night playing with different doubles partners—a serve skill-competition then sealed the tie-breaker win for Segura.

Segura is the grand nephew of Pancho “Segoo” Segura, who was ranked No. 1 in the world in the 1940’s and 50’s.

“It was really nice—I’ve never played in a pro-am before,” said Segura, 18. His two-handed forehand and backhand has led him to a top 30 national junior ranking and No. 4 in Florida. “It was a fun experience. It was nice to hit with some of the amateurs and pros here. Win or lose, I’m out here to have fun.”

Daciek always loves playing the clay in Pensacola.

“It was fun to get out here again with all the tennis fans and the people that support this tournament,” Daciek said. “Without them, they wouldn’t be able to host it every year. I’ve been here probably six or seven years. I’ve won the pro-am a couple of times—I’m kind of the pro-am specialist here.”

Local business owner and USTA player Mansfield Coe was the top amateur on the night. Eighth-grader Lyons was the local runner-up. Both took home a glass trophy as the prize. Coe was happy just to be able to play in the competition.

“It’s great to be able to play out here with all these guys—this is the best tennis we’re gonna see for a while,” Coe said. “It’s kind of a privilege to be out here. I would jump at the chance to do it again.”

New changes = Better tennis

Tournament director Skip Vogelsang is eager to see even better competition with the new changes.

“I kind of compare this to Double-A baseball—with generally the top 300-600 players,” Vogelsang said. “Triple-A would be the ‘Challenger’ tour, and those are with players in the 150-300 ranking. And the ‘big leagues’ are with the top 150 in the world. These players are just working their butt off traveling from city to city playing these tournaments, trying to earn points to move up in those rankings.

“And someday play in the U.S. Open—that’s their dream.”

This time, there’s no need for a winter coat.

“I’m excited about it—the weather has cooperated—we’ve been very fortunate,” Vogelsang said. “Last November, we had to have heaters on in the office, and some players were playing with three layers of clothes on. So it ‘s been a nice change—for players and spectators alike.”

Local fans and players are highly encouraged to see the rest of the week’s top-quality competition, as entrance to the event is always free.

Matches begin at 10 a.m. today (Thursday). Doubles finals will be Saturday, with singles on Sunday.

“This is not just another (local) tennis tournament,” Vogelsang said. “This is a different animal, with world-class players. You’ll be seeing some of these guys on TV one day.”",http://rssfeeds.pnj.com/~/601784080/0/pensacola/home~Pensacola-M-Championship-in-full-swing-at-Roger-Scott/,2019-05-09T13:15:21Z,Pensacola News Journal,Couple,"101 E Romana St, Pensacola, FL 32502, USA",FL,32502

Larry Kelly always bets on his horses.

As general manager of the Payson Park Training Facility in Indiantown, Kelly tried to keep up the tradition for this year's Kentucky Derby, but he lost service on his iPad before the race. When he got back on the internet, it was too late to place his bet.

Maybe Kelly was jinxing his horses all along.

Country House, Code of Honor and Tacitus, who were being trained at Payson Park right before the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, took first, second and third place in the race.

If Kelly had made the $336 bet he planned, he would’ve won $3,000.

“The consolation was to be very proud of Payson Park,” Kelly said. “The odds of those three horses being one-two-three all coming out of here just literally weeks ago is pretty amazing.”

Tacitus left Payson Park a month before the Kentucky Derby to head to a New York race, but the top two winners, Country House and Code of Honor, were training in Indiantown up until a week before they shipped out for the derby.

Just to have them finish in second, third and fourth places was crazy enough, Kelly said.

The circumstances were even wilder because the original first place winner, Maximum Security, was disqualified after an interference objection.

“When they took it down (Maximum Security's win), that was in its own right basically history,” Kelly said. “But then for Payson Park to have the one, two, three finishers — you have as good of a shot at winning the lottery.”

It would be rare for any training facility to occupy all three top spots, he said.

California, which likely has between 4,000 and 5,000 horses stabled between two training centers, has maybe five to six of them run in the Kentucky Derby — and one of those might hit the board.

More: Life remains normal for Kentucky Derby winner Country House

He noted a big exception would be California-based trainer Bob Baffert, who won the Triple Crown with American Pharaoh in 2015 and Justify in 2018.

Bill Mott, who lives in Palm City, was the trainer for first place Country House and third place Tacitus. Claude R. McGaughey III, who won the Kentucky Derby in 2013 with Orb — also out of Payson Park — was the trainer for second place Code of Honor.

“All of Martin County should be extremely proud,” Kelly said. “There’s a little bit of a lack of knowledge (about Payson Park).”

The training facility gets about 30 calls each month, many asking to come ride, but it doesn’t have horses for riding.

However, Payson Park is open to the public, he said. The horses train from Oct. 15 to May 15 every year, but the facility still is open on weekdays for people to explore even when the horses aren’t training.

“We don’t have much other than you’re just welcome to come and watch some of the best thoroughbreds in the world train,” Kelly said.

Payson Park, which has been voted one of the top training centers in the world, is well-known nationally and internationally in the horse racing realm.

It’s important for 2-year-old horses turning 3 to get sunshine because that’s their bone-strengthening year, Kelly said. Even when he used to race horses in New York, he always would send them south for the sun.

The Indiantown training facility is different from others because it limits the number of horses to 500 and doesn’t train year-round.

“It’s unique in a way that it’s not overcrowded or overused,” Kelly said.

That appeal has attracted five of the top trainers internationally, as well as horses from across the world, including South Africa, Germany and Australia.

Even sheikhs and the Queen of England, who’s a friend of owner Virginia Kraft Payson, keep their horses in Indiantown, he said.

“They’re all expensive horses,” Kelly said. “They come here to get ready for these derby races.”

The training facility has a 1-mile dirt course track that’s been rated one of the best in the nation, he said. It also has a 7/8-mile turf course, which is unusual for training centers, and several miles of galloping trails that go out through the woods.

“It’s a place where people take their horse to get ready for the coming year,” Kelly said. “It’s just a spring training camp for the best.”

Kelly, who’s father was the first trainer at what was then the St. Lucie Training Center when it opened in the 1950s, had his eye on several Payson Park horses that looked promising this year.

“As we were coming close a couple months ago, a couple of them were up there in the points,” Kelly said. “It was like, ‘holy God man, we might have a couple run in the derby,’ which is cool.”

By the time of the Kentucky Derby, he thought all three horses had legitimate chances. Still, Kelly didn’t get too excited because every year brings horses that have the points, but seem too young and haven’t won enough races to do what he described as the equivalent of crawling into the boxing ring with Mike Tyson.

But it wasn’t a total shock to have winners out of Payson Park, which typically puts out horses that are major players in racing, he said.

The training facility has had winners in the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes.

“Our next goal will have to be to have a Triple Crown winner,” Kelly said.

185,Hillsborough toddler will get court ordered chemo treatment today,"SAINT PETERSBURG, Fla. - TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - The decision is in when it comes to a Tampa toddler receiving chemotherapy treatment while he battles leukemia.

A Hillsborough County judge ruled that 3-year-old Noah McAdams must undergo chemo as he continues to fight a recent cancer diagnosis.

The child's parents were hoping for a more organic approach to treatment, one that includes medical-grade cannabis, vitamins and a strict diet.

While the judge ruled that alternative treatments are permissible, the primary course of action, she said, must include chemotherapy within the next 28 days.

As Noah's parents left the courthouse in downtown Tampa after Wednedsay's ruling, they described the judge's decision as, ""disappointing.""

The toddler's mother, Taylor Bland-Ball, told WFLA, ""I feel like it's definitely increased my fight, my strength and ultimately, my forgiveness, because having to look at these people who have no regards for my son is difficult.""

The child's father described how painful this has been and explained how his heart felt Wednesday.

""It's dropped, and it's picking back up, and it's still pumping blood. I love my son, and I'm going to be there for him,"" said Joshua McAdams.

The couple maintains they just want what's best for their little boy.

As Noah fights leukemia, his parents have been fighting the system.

The toddler has already received two chemo treatments at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, according to family members. However, when Noah's mother and father took him out of state last week, seeking a second opinion, they were stopped in Ketucky by law enforcement.

Shortly after, they lost custody of their son.

The parents hired an attorney and took their fight to court, hoping a judge would rule in their favor for a more natural approach to treating their young son's cancer.

They were pleased the court took time to listen to their concerns, but ultimately, heartbroken, when the ruling was announced Wednesday, after two days of grueling court testimony, that their son must undergo chemotherapy.

""It is a mixed bag, in that we obvously have to watch this child go through chemothearpy, but at least we know with the use of cannabis and other treatments that the child will be able to deal with chemotherapy, rather than not being able to have those alternative treatments available,"" their attorney, Michael MInardi, said.

For now, the child's grandparents have temporary custody, although Noah's mother and father will be allowed at his medical appointments and treatments.

The parents say they are working to regain custody of their little boy.

They explained that they're currently working with the Department of Children and Famlies to arrange unsupervised visits.

With the judge's ruling today, Noah is scheduled to receive chemotherapy treatment at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in downtown St. Petersburg today, according to his parents and their attorney.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/hillsborough-toddler-will-get-court-ordered-chemo-treatment-today/1991511210,2019-05-09T08:28:24Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
186,Boating accident victim reunites with those who saved his life,"<p>A South Florida man went to Jackson Memorial Hospital on Wednesday morning to reunite with the people who saved his life last year after a boating accident on Father's Day.</p>

<p>""This one really hit home for me on a personal level because I am a boater and I was out there with my kids,"" Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Lt. Terrance Dolan said. </p>

<p>The accident is a Father's Day connection that Dolan and Jonathan Cruz will share forever. </p>

<p>Cruz was out on the water with his twins and his wife at Elliot Key last June when a nearby boater asked for help getting off a sandbar. As Cruz got close to the boat, someone accidentally turned it on and put it in gear.</p>

<p>""I wasn't behind the boat yet. I was still a couple feet away -- probably like 2 or 3 feet away -- and then I just remember getting sucked in,"" Cruz said. </p>

<p>Dolan was nearby on a boat with his family. He heard the screams, grabbed an emergency bag and headed out to help.</p>

<p>""We took a bunch of dry beach towels, packed it up and then tied it as tight as we could to stop the bleeding as much as possible,"" Dolan said. ""And then, at that time, luckily I had an IV, and I started an IV on him.""</p>

<p>By starting an IV and reducing blood loss, Dolan kept Cruz alive until he could be airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.</p>

<p>""This injury took place in the water, and so there is a high risk for infection that adds to the insult from the initial traumatic injury,"" Dr. Joyce Kaufman said. </p>

<p>Kaufman led the team that kept Cruz in a coma for three weeks and performed 30 surgeries followed by intense therapy. Though his leg and pelvis were severely injured, the medical team that worked on him see him as a miracle.</p>

<p>""It was very traumatic, even for me, because it was just a lot. I felt very emotional afterward,"" Dolan said.   </p>

<p>""I was blessed,"" Cruz said. ""You know, I was blessed to be here.""</p>

<p>Cruz still has multiple surgeries ahead of him. A <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/swaw6-jonathan-cruz"">GoFundMe page</a> has been created to help him and his family during their time of need. </p>

187,"Young prosecutors, public defenders get pay boost","Minimum pay for all Florida assistant public defenders and assistant state attorneys will rise to $50,000, up from $39,084, starting Oct. 1.

The employees of Stacy Scott and Bill Cervone are adversaries in the courtroom but the teamwork of their bosses helped them get a slight pay raise last year and a boost in minimum pay this year as the Florida Legislature wrapped up its session.

Minimum pay for all Florida assistant public defenders and assistant state attorneys will be boosted Oct. 1 to $50,000, up from $39,084, partly through the efforts of Scott and Cervone.

“We lobbied very hard all throughout the session, and it happened. I’m a little surprised because normally it takes a couple of years of asking to get something to happen,” said Scott, the 8th Circuit’s public defender. “We had the strong support of the speaker of the House (of Representatives) and then we got Sen. Rob Bradley to support it. They agreed to put it in the full budget. It was fantastic.”

Cervone said he generally starts trainees just out of law school at about $42,000. They get a $2,000 promotion when they pass the Florida Bar exam.

“It impacts about eight of my current or prospective employees to varying degrees,” Cervone said. “This is something that is going to have a very positive long-term effect on recruiting and retention, at least for the first few years of someone’s tenure.”

Cervone and Scott said they will give raises to their assistants who have been on the job for a few years to curb the wage compression that will occur when newcomers are making at or close to the salary of employees who have been on board for a few years.

The minimum salary of $50,000 will put assistant prosecutors and defenders on par with the Florida Bar’s average starting salary for a new lawyer. Generally, freshly minted attorneys can make more money in private practice than in public practice.

Health insurance and retirement benefits offered for state employees can help make the public work a bit more competitive but those benefits often aren't as important a factor for recent law school grads, Cervone said.

Scott said she believes the pay increase will help her keep employees. The state turnover rate for assistant public defenders is about 19 percent. Scott’s rate is about 11 percent.

Even with the raise in minimum pay, many of the assistants will still have to watch their budgets because they face student loans and other debt, Scott said.

“When you look at the debt and the cost of living, it’s still really low,” Scott said. “But it’s a huge step in the right direction...The thing that really gets people to stay with us is that they have a passion for the work, and the health and retirement benefits are key.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190508/young-prosecutors-public-defenders-get-pay-boost?rssfeed=true,2019-05-08T16:21:21Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608

(WFLA) - Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made their first public appearance with their son, two days after welcoming the new addition to the royal family.

The couple stood in front of reporters at George’s Hall in Windsor Castle and Harry held their newborn in his arms.

“It’s magic. It’s pretty amazing. I have the best two guys in the world, so I’m really happy,"" Markle said of being a new mother.

She said her child “has the sweetest temperament. He’s really calm.”

“I don’t know where he gets that from!” Harry added.

“He’s just been a dream,” Markle said. “It’s been a special couple of days.”",http://www.wfla.com/news/world/meet-the-royal-baby-meghan-markle-prince-harry-introduce-child-to-the-world/1988532565,2019-05-08T11:58:55Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

""I thought it was a spider web. It was literally burning,"" he said. For what it was, I'm lucky to walk away.""



The couple declined to reveal their identity in fear of retaliation but they showed News 6 pictures of what the man's throat looked like yesterday and where they found the line, tied from a fishing dock to a tree at the Joyce Ebbins Fishing Pier and Observation Deck.



""He literally could have been decapitated. If we were going faster like we normally do and it wasn't raining,"" said the woman. ""There's no way this could have been somebody's fishing line that got hung up on the dock and they just walked with it because it would be laying on the ground. It was strung up around neck height on purpose.""



The couple notified Ormond Beach police who are now investigating the incident.

The woman said it hasn't stopped them from riding their bikes on Monday, but said they'll be extra careful and warns others to be as well.



""If you're out here just be vigilant and keep your eyes out. You don't know what's out there,"" she said.

198,South Florida man waits 2 years to receive title for purchased motorcycle,"<p>A South Florida man got the motor running on his new motorcycle and was all set to head out on the highway, but there's one big problem.</p>

<p>Ruben Mendez recently purchased a Honda Magna V-30 motorcycle that has just 14,000 miles on it.</p>

<p>""I've changed all the hoses on it, gave her a tune up, put a fairing, some extra spot lights and a couple of trunks in there,"" he said. ""All I need right now is some tires and a tag to get her on the road, and she's ready to go."" </p>

<p>Mendez told Local 10's Leave it to Layron team that he spotted the motorcycle at a neighbor's house and that neighbor eventually agreed to sell it to him.</p>

<p>Mendez said he began making monthly $50 payments on the motorcycle on Jan. 14, 2017, until the bike was paid for to the sum of $1,000, which was agreed upon by him and the seller.</p>

<p>""Every time I paid, I signed. He received, he signed,"" Mendez said. </p>

<p>Mendez took possession of the bike and said the seller moved out of the neighborhood, although he would still come by to receive payments.</p>

<p>Mendez said he took a motorcycle endorsement class and kept making his payments until last September when the final payment was due. </p>

<p>""My payment, my title, goodbye and we're done,"" he said. </p>

<p>But when it was time to hand over the title, Mendez said the seller ghosted him.</p>

<p>""No call, no show. The last address I went to, he doesn't live there,"" Mendez said. ""No emails, no voicemails, no texts -- no anything.""</p>

<p>Mendez said he has gone to numerous places to find out how he can aquire a tag for the motorcycle but has turned up empty-handed.</p>

<p>""Nobody could give me answers,"" he said. ""In fact, I went to a tag agency on Sheridan Street, and I explained to the man what was going on with me, and he just looked at me boldly and said, 'Well, I guess you have a bike you can't ride.' So that's when I got fed up and said, 'I got to make a phone call,' and you're the phone call.""</p>

<p>It's a good thing Mendez did keep his detailed ledger and contract.</p>

<p>The LITL team contacted the county tax collector's office, which said the ledger, the receipts, the signatures, the title and VIN could all be presented to a clerk of court.</p>

<p>A court order could then be issued, granting Mendez ownership of the bike. All he'd have to do from there is present that order to the DMV to get his title and tags.</p>

<p>""(I) just want to ride the bike, pop wheelies, cause all kinds of Hades and be free like a bird,"" Mendez said. ""That's all I want to do, is just ride.""</p>

199,Naked toddler near Florida IHOP leads to arrest of passed out couple,"PANAMA CITY, Fla. - Employees of a Florida IHOP were headed to work early Friday when they found a naked toddler wandering the restaurant's parking lot. They then found the toddler's mom and the mom's fiance passed out in a nearby van.

Panama City police said the employees were unable to wake Jordyn Freeman, 24, and Randy McMillin, 27, both of whom were under the influence of drugs.

Police said two 9-month-old children were also found in the van, along with drugs and drug paraphernalia. They said one of the twins was covered in blankets and pillows.

Police said the soiled children were given clean clothes and diapers and placed with the state Department of Children and Families.

The Ohio couple was arrested on charges including methamphetamine possession.

203,"Cape Coral mom celebrates miracle daughter this Mother's Day, 9 months after dad's death","CLOSE Cape Coral mom welcomes girl after dad's death Ricardo Rolon, Fort Myers News-Press

Tiffany Bannworth looks into the faces of her seven children and sees her husband.

They are all she has left of the man who'd been her life partner for nearly 20 years. Stephen Bannworth died in August in a Fort Myers motorcycle crash.

This Mother's Day, the Cape Coral mother will celebrate each of the boys they created and the miracle daughter born nine months after his death with a nice dinner and family outing.

""We're replacing a bad memory with remembrance of happiness and celebration,"" she said of the holidays and anniversaries since their lives upended.

Tiffany Bannworth sits with her children Dante Alexander, 16; Cairo Hawthorne, 12; Jasper Constantine, 10; Roman Zhivago, 8; Quinton Phineas,7; Kipling Cicero, 5; and Amunet Corencia Pearl, 2.5 weeks.

The six boys look like their dad Stephen Bannworth at different stages of his life, she said, as she cradles his final gift in her arms.

Amunet Corencia Pearl Bannworth arrived on Good Friday. The 35-year-old mother gave her the moniker they'd decided upon if it was girl during a 2007 pregnancy, their third.

""He would recognize it anywhere,"" she said of their daughter's name. Amunet is the Egyptian goddess of mystery. She joins siblings Dante, Cairo, Jasper, Roman, Quinton and Kipling Bannworth. A seventh son, Gatsby Bannworth, died six years ago at 3 months old.

Oldest son Dante, 16, said last year started out ""great at first,"" the six boys and their parents taking weekend outings and enjoying their time with one another.

Then, his father's death abruptly changed their trajectory.

""Now it sucks because my dad wanted a girl,"" Dante Bannworth said, his father's prayers answered in death, only never to see her.

Stephen Bannworth was a stay-at-home dad. He and Tiffany met and courted, having Dante when Tiffany was 19. Stephen supported her dreams, saw her through college and her doctorate.

She is now executive director at Nicaea Academy of Southwest Florida, a birth through college education facility in Cape Coral. Amunet sleeps in her mother's office, all six boys always nearby, attending classes.

The family's closeness is no surprise. It's what Stephen Bannworth cultivated, Tiffany Bannworth said.

Tiffany and Stephen Bannworth were with each other every day — a streak of 3,992 of them — since Sept. 1, 2007, she said. If she went on a quick archaeology trip — one of her many interests and qualifications — she left Saturday morning and returned Sunday night, making sure they kissed good-bye and hello.

Tiffany, an only child, had always known Stephen wanted a big family.

The Bannworth family is nearly three times the size of the average family. The U.S. Census Bureau counted about 83.09 million families with an average of 3.14 persons in 2018, down from 3.7 in the 1960s.

Dante was the first baby Tiffany Bannworth ever held. Within weeks, she told Stephen she wanted more. Lots more.

Four years after Dante, the Bannworths had five more sons within six years.

Their sixth, Gatsby, died in his sleep three months after his birth.

""We thought that was the unthinkable,"" she said. But Stephen held the family together.

""He was so strong and cultivated a tight-knit family,"" she said. ""A part of our hearts were missing. He carried us through the grief.""

Within the year, son Kipling was born, and Stephen understood Tiffany's fears of losing another child.

""I was scared it could happen again,"" Tiffany Bannworth said. ""He said he would quit his job and watch Kipling until he went to school.""

He kept that promise: Kipling started kindergarten days after Stephen's death.

In the years between, Stephen Bannworth washed their clothes, cooked and cleaned and did all the home repairs himself.

""Some people thought he was just some schlub,"" she said. ""He was so incredible. He was more of a man than I could ever imagine meeting.""

Their passion lasted their entire marriage.

Over the summer, the family car needed replacing.

While waiting on a new vehicle to arrive last August, Stephen Bannworth would take Tiffany to work on the back of his motorcycle. He did so the Saturday before his death.

He would park across from the main building on campus and rev the engine as she walked across the lot.

""He'd blow kisses and wink,"" she said. ""I still got flustered. We were really love struck.""

She drove the new vehicle to school for the first time the morning he died. He had fixed the locks on the vehicle to prepare it for use the day before. He'd also repaired the curio cabinet glass, cleaned the house and washed every bit of laundry, not knowing he wouldn't return from his motorcycle ride.

She remembers the acute feeling of loss in the days after his death — she didn't have a single stitch of clothing remaining that carried his scent.

""The glaring absence of him was noticed by me,"" she said, adding she was in her bed, crying to God: ""Let me be pregnant with his last child.'""

Then, when her pregnancy was confirmed six weeks later, ""How blessed I felt. What a miracle it was.""

Friends, family and even strangers stepped up to help fill the void. A GoFundMe campaign raised more than $12,000; a woman linked to the Nicaea school paid for the entire funeral. Christmas came and people showered the family with gift cards.

People told her stories about how Stephen had helped them, without her ever knowing.

On the weekend that would have been their wedding anniversary, friends gathered to celebrate the couple. The next day, Tiffany Bannworth said, 50 people came to her baby shower.

On her birthday Tuesday, the school's students gathered around a store-bought birthday cake with the bright yellow icing, macaroons and doughnuts. Her sons surrounded her, Amunet on her lap, as everyone sang 'Happy Birthday.""

It's a new memory, to complement the other birthdays where Stephen would make any kind of cake she asked.

""It's difficult to be away from him,"" she said. ""There's never going to be another man like Steve.""

As Mother's Day loomed, she reflected on what she learned from the man she knew she could spend several lifetimes with and follow the example he set.

""He was very loving and doting and protective and very pure,"" she said. "" ... Co-parenting with him was a piece of cake.""

That they are a strong family and going through life together shows in how the brothers have welcomed Amunet.

""They are very protective of her,"" Tiffany Bannworth said, ""especially (Kipling). They don't want anybody to touch her.""

She will spend her Mother's Day, the first having a daughter, thinking about the man who helped her become a mom and making memories with the six versions of himself he left behind.

""This was a day that Stevie lavished me with gifts and attention,"" she said. He'd take the boys to a thrift store to look for antique glass.

""I have a big collection, but I refuse to spend a lot of money on it,"" she said. ""That used to bug Steve. He liked to buy me expensive things, but I liked the novelty of finding it for next to nothing.

""This year there will be none of that.""

She planned to cook a nice dinner on Saturday, inviting her mother to join them.

She cherishes the memories Stephen left her with, their last morning together and their final embrace.

""Boy, would I kill for another kiss from my husband,"" she said.

204,"Seven months after Hurricane Michael, 'Forgotten Coast' becomes 'Unforgettable Coast'","CLOSE After riding out Hurricane Michael floating on a mattress, a Mexico Beach resident lives in a FEMA trailer in her front yard as contractors rebuild her home. Annie Blanks and Nate Chute, Pensacola News Journal

Story Highlights Hurricane Michael made landfall seven months ago

Areas like Mexico Beach and eastern Panama City are still disaster zones, with recovery taking time

Congress has failed to pass any supplemental relief funding for the Florida Panhandle

Sitting inside the quaint Caribbean Coffee restaurant in Mexico Beach, it’s a normal Wednesday afternoon.

The owner, Dave Kiser, is busy making cappuccinos and chicken salad croissant sandwiches for a small line of customers. Beacon Hill residents Dana and Charlie Black sit at a table near the front window, drinking coffee and talking about their fitness studio, Fit as a Fiddle, which is located in neighboring Windmark Beach.

Caribbean Coffee is located on the north side of U.S. 98, with a crystal clear view of the Gulf of Mexico visible from the shop’s front windows. But as beautiful as the view may be, it still gives the Blacks pause. Just seven months ago, you wouldn’t have been able to see the Gulf of Mexico from the shop window.

Day after the storm: Hurricane Michael cripples Panama City with heartbreaking devastation

“There used to be houses there. It was all houses, our neighbors. My friend Natalie lived over there,” Dana Black said, pointing across the street to an empty beachfront lot. “When she returned after the storm, all she found left of her house were two plates. People drive over here and they look at views like that and they think, ‘Oh, this looks really good.’ But for people who live here, it just makes us sad. Because we know what it used to be.”

Seven months after Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 monstrosity, struck the eastern Florida Panhandle on Oct. 10, residents in the hardest-hit areas are only now starting to find a sense of normalcy.

A massive storm: Hurricane Michael upgraded to Category 5 — only fourth on record

Financial toll: Hurricane Michael insurance losses top $4.65 billion

That new normal looks different every few miles. In Mexico Beach, for instance, construction workers and contractors outnumber the remaining residents 10 to one. Houses (the ones that are lucky enough to still be intact) have insurance claim numbers spray painted on their exterior walls. “For Sale” signs sit next to rows of empty house foundations on streets that used to be lined with million-dollar mansions.

In Panama City, neighborhood streets look more like nuclear war zones than habitable housing developments. Twisted trees that used to tower over homes are now resting in the homes’ living rooms, and piles of debris dot every street corner. Many restaurants and businesses have reopened — some still with plywood on the windows, but with the words “We’re open!” enthusiastically painted on the wood.

As lawmakers in Washington continue to spar over the details of supplemental disaster relief funding that has still not made its way to the devastated Panhandle, residents who are living there are just trying to get by, day by day.

“We are still living in a disaster,” said Diane Pugh, who’s living in a FEMA trailer in what used to be her front yard in Mexico Beach. “We need gas stations, furniture stores, groceries. We just need help, period.”

Stories of survival and sunsets

Nearly everyone you come across in Mexico Beach and Panama City has their own Hurricane Michael story.

Some rode out the storms in their houses, like Pugh, who recalled floating in her bedroom on her mattress with her Chihuahua, Zoey, until she finally heard the wind die down.

Some, like church pastor Dave Gieseking, evacuated, only to return when it was finally safe just to find their homes completely gone.

Charlie and Dana Black, the couple in the coffee shop, rode out the storm in their Beacon Hill home, in their bathroom with their mattress on top of them.

“I guess at about 6:15 p.m. the rain finally stopped, you could see the end of the storm,” Charlie Black said. “It came right in and blew right over us, and then I’ll never forget that night. There was the most beautiful sunset after the storm.”

Like Charlie Black, many residents who stayed behind to rebuild after the hurricane do their best to find the “sunset” in every day.

Gieseking, the church pastor, used to hold Sunday services in his Living Water Church at the Beach on U.S. 98 in Mexico Beach. Now, all that’s left of the church is the foundation, and Gieseking lives in a FEMA trailer on the church’s property. But he still holds services every Sunday — only now, they’re on the beach instead of in a church.

“Day to day, it’s just trying to connect up with people and find out who’s still here and who’s not,” he said, standing on the foundation of his old church. “It’s slow, person-to-person kind of stuff, because a good number of people are now scattered all across the country. With the people who are still here, they range from going through depression to determination.”

Olga Cemore lived in Panama City during the hurricane, but has since moved to Dallas because she was unable to find work in the area after the storm. But she came back to the area this past week to pass out Home Depot gift cards to churches from a virtual triathlon she held to raise money for the area. Cemore gave Gieseking a hand full of $50 Home Depot gift cards to help his church buy materials for their new structure.

“I hosted a triathlon here for 13 years, but obviously this year, we couldn’t do it,” Cemore said. “So I did a virtual run, people signed up for it online and I mailed them a bib number and a medal. We collected over $5,000, so I bought a bunch of gift cards and am driving around today handing them out to churches and people.”

Clutching the stack of gift cards in his hand and standing on the empty lot his church used to be on, Gieseking told Cemore how grateful he was for the help and gave her a hug.

“Sometimes you look around here and go, ‘what’s going to happen?’” Gieseking said. “But we’re going to make it work, whatever it takes.”

Day by day, rebuilding is happening everywhere

The hurricane permanently displaced thousands of Panhandle residents, most of whom had no home to go back to or office building from which to work. But for those who stayed behind, the process of rebuilding will be long, arduous — and worth it.

The Blacks said they considered themselves the “lucky ones.” Their home sustained minor roof damage, loss of power and some flooding, but they have been able to remain in their home as they await contractors to come. Their gym, Fit as a Fiddle, lost more than half its clientele after the storm.

“Dana came home after we first opened back up, and she was really upset,” Charlie Black said. “People were calling her to say, ‘I can’t be a member anymore, I’m homeless,’ or, ‘I’m living with my son in Little Rock until we can rebuild.’ A lot of people haven’t come back, and will probably never come back.”

Dana Black said one of the biggest challenges facing residents as they try and rebuild is finding qualified, honest contractors. She said a lot of people came to the area after the storm and scammed residents by price gouging, promising work that was never done and taking money for doing shoddy construction work.

“The worst part of all of it is that people need roofs, but people are coming in trying to help us but they jack the prices way up,” she said. “And some people don’t have insurance.”

Pugh, the woman living in a FEMA trailer in her front yard, said she was lucky to have a family friend who was a contractor who was working on fixing her home. The biggest challenge facing her, she said, was the lack of access to groceries, medical care and basic needs like gas.

“It’s still hard just trying to get basic things,” Pugh said. “Gas stations, stores, they’re all gone. You’ve got to go down to Port St. Joe, or I go to Callaway, but it’s real hard when you’re used to just being able to walk up the street.”

Gieseking, the church pastor, said one of the most critical parts of rebuilding the area will be Tyndall Air Force Base, which is sandwiched in between Mexico City and Panama City. The base was a huge economic anchor for the area and was decimated during Michael. Reconstruction on base stopped May 1 when Congress failed to pass a supplemental funding bill.

Gieseking said many residents are waiting to return until the future of the base is more certain, but until then, those who stayed behind are taking things day by day, brick by brick.

“We want people to know that we’re still here,” he said. “We’re still here, and we’re going to rebuild, and we’re going to be this quaint little town on the coast again. They called us the ‘Forgotten Coast’ for a long time before the storm, but to me, now, we’re the ‘Unforgettable Coast.’”

205,Legislative session's done but the tunes continue | Music roundup,"Kati Schardl (Photo: Kati Schardl)

My mom was a nurse-turned-social worker who often worked long hours, as did my dad, before coming home to wrangle three rambunctious kids. When she was particularly exhausted, she used to sigh, “My get-up-and-go just got-up-and-went.”

Mama, I feel ya.

After the grueling final weeks of the legislative session with my day job (editor in the Senate bill drafting office), keeping up with the bangin’ spring music and culture scene with my side ride (this column and other bits for the Democrat) and wrapping up two freelance stories for another publication (somehow, miraculously, on deadline), I am plumb tuckered out. The well is dry. The tank is drained. The needle is buried on “empty.”

So I’m going to go away soon for a little vacation. Which means that for a few weeks, I won’t be monitoring and chronicling the scene in this column. My last Roundup before my holiday will be in next week’s May 17 Limelight, but I’ll be back in action for the June 14 Limelight.

While I’m away, send your information to limelight@tallahassee.com, but continue to copy me at limelightroundup@gmail.com on what you send (because I want to know what I’m missing).

I still have a couple of weeks to enjoy some Tallahassee talent. Here’s what’s in store this week:

Legendary bluesman Guitar Shorty may not do back flips, headstands and somersaults anymore, but he can still heat up the frets when he picks up the guitar. Shorty — a Kissimmee, Fla., native whose raw, scorching blues has been captured on such acclaimed releases as the aptly titled “Bare Knuckle” and “We the People” — was a regular visitor to Tallahassee before he moved to the Left Coast several years ago. He cut his teeth as a teen playing with Ray Charles’ band and has recorded with Willie Dixon and toured with T-Bone Walker, Big Joe Turner, Little Richard and Sam Cooke. Shorty even has a Hendrix connection — he married the late legend’s step-sister in 1961 and was an influence on the world-changing guitarist. He makes a long-awaited return to the juke joint’s corner stage at 6 p.m. Sunday at Bradfordville Blues Club, 7152 Moses Lane. Tickets are $20 advance, $25 at the door.

One-woman blues crew

It’s appropriate that Ruth Wyand calls her one-woman musical act Tribe of One. Her sound is so big and so varied that it really does sound as if a tribe of musicians is making that glorious noise. Wyand does it all herself with foot drums and a variety of guitars. She’s so good, in fact, that she was an International Blues Challenge finalist in 2017 and semi-finalist in 2018. Wyand is also a top-notch storyteller and she has a wealth of great tales from her years of touring as a one-woman operation. Wyand brings all the bells and whistles along with her capacious songbag when she stops in on the way to Gainesville for the North Central Florida Blues Society’s Women In Blues Showcase for a foot-stompin’ night at 8 p.m. Thursday at Blue Tavern, 1206 N.

206,President Trump's promises to the Panhandle,"President Trump's promises to the Panhandle Video

PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. -- On Wednesday, President Donald J. Trump addressed a crowd of thousands in Panama City Beach. Inside Aaron Bessent Park, most attendees were eager to hear what he had to say about hurricane relief.

Making his first Florida trip of the 2020 campaign, President Trump made many promises to those recovering from Hurricane Michael.

""I was last here in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Michael, you remember, we came. It was pretty bad stuff and I pledged to you, unwavering support,"" said the President during his speech.

Support and billions of dollars are two things the president says are coming to the panhandle. ""And we will never ever leave your side. We've already given you billions of dollars and there's a lot more coming as you do it.""

In fact, our area has received about $1.1 billion dollars as of mid-April but Congress still hasn't passed a federal disaster funding bill.

President Trump also addressed the rebuilding of Tyndall Air Force Base.

President Trump said, ""and I got a call from your great representatives and they said, 'President, they want to close Tyndall cause it got beat up badly. It got beat."" I made a couple of calls and I said 'General, why are we doing that? Those people are incredible.""

Currently, all new base construction is on hold without that disaster funding. According to the official Tyndall website, recovery efforts started the day after the storm. The Secretary of the Air Force announced Tyndall would be rebuilt just 16 days after the storm.

President Trump also had a big announcement for the impacted counties and municipalities.

""Because of the severity of the storm, category 5, we will have the federal government pay for 90% of the costs in many circumstances,"" said President Trump.

The 90% reimbursement has been a big concern for local governments struggling to clean-up after Michael. Bay County officials now say the President's word is good enough for them and they consider the 90/10 split to be official.

The president also promising $448 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development Disaster Recovery to reestablish low-income housing locally.",https://www.mypanhandle.com/don-t-miss/president-trump-s-promises-to-the-panhandle/1992878794,2019-05-10T00:10:46Z,MYPANHANDLE,Couple,"613 Harrison Ave, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
207,Shoaf urges DEP to delay breach fill,"In a letter to its top official, Jason Shoaf urged the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to step back from plans to fill a breach left behind by Hurricane Michael in T.H. Stone Memorial St. Joseph Peninsula State Park.

In his letter to Secretary Noah Valenstein, Shoaf said he believed the decision to fill the breach had been made “despite the community’s urging against it and without additional research to consider the environmental impacts.”

The letter was sent on stationary for his campaign, Jason Shoaf for State Representative, and detailed that Shoaf was a resident who lived through the storm and sees the remnants of the storm daily.

The letter followed by a few days a recent public town hall meeting at which plans for the park were unveiled.

Most particularly, the plans included partnering with the county on its late summer beach restoration project, which would now include filling the breach at Eagle Harbor.

Ultimately, the plans would also include restoring the main road running through the park as well a project to restore dune habitat wiped out by Michael.

For some at the meeting, the plans were a surprise.

“This seems a like a done deal,” said resident Dusty May, adding that during an early meeting DEP staff seemed to indicate the process would be lengthy and the public kept abreast.

Shoaf, in his letters, mentions that first town hall meeting in January.

“There is great concern in my community that the decision by the DEP did not fully consider the public’s input at the January meeting,” he wrote.

“Furthermore, environmental advocates in the community are seriously concerned that the environmental impacts have not been properly measured and fully evaluated before the decision to alter Mother Nature.”

The overwhelming public input, at least vocally, has been voiced in support of leaving the breach alone.

May is among many locals, and a member of an advocacy group to save and restore St. Joseph Bay, that believe the saltwater from the breach is a cleanser for the bay, mitigation in part for the freshwater canal.

The Defender’s of Wildlife have argued from the beginning that St. Joseph Bay should be the priority of any park plan.

On the other hand, Park Manager Mark Knapke said the overwhelming majority of public comments submitted by mail or email encourage the restoration of the camping area, which is north of the breach.

Camping is also one of the key ingredients for attendance which is among the highest in the state as well as the healthy revenue generated by the park.

And, the breach is also significantly filled, though not fully.

The depth is down to just a couple of feet, but the water continues to flow.

Given the mixed views and the sensitivity of the environment involved, Shoaf urged the DEP to hold off on its current plans.

“I urge you to delay the project to fill in the peninsula park’s breach until we can assess all the options and the consequences of each option,” Shoaf wrote. With more time, I am confident we can pursue a solution that is good for the economy, good for the environment and best for our community.”",https://www.starfl.com/news/20190509/shoaf-urges-dep-to-delay-breach-fill?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T23:37:40Z,"The Star, Port St. Joe",Couple,"101 W Hwy 98, Port St Joe, FL 32456, USA",FL,32456
208,"Six months into fiscal year, TDC still trending on budget","Tourism numbers took a dip in March, but through the first half of the fiscal year they are remarkably on target.

Bed tax collections dropped 34 percent in March compared to the prior March, but the Gulf County Tourist Development Council is sitting about where its budget had predicted.

Part of that is foresight and part is stronger than expected visitation.

Hurricane Michael arrived last October, the first month of the fiscal but also time enough for the TDC board to adjust downward revenue numbers.

The board and Board of County Commissioners approved slicing about half from the original projection of $2 million.

And now, six months into the fiscal year the TDC has collected just under $460,000 in bed taxes, just shy of budget.

And as for visitor numbers, a deficit of 22 percent in bed tax collections compared to the prior year, given the deficiency of lodging inventory in the months immediately after the storm can be seen in a favorable light.

Particularly when considering the prior fiscal year was a record-shattering, revenue-wise.

“I think there were a couple of things,” said TDC executive director Kelli Godwin, who noted the 34 percent drop followed months of declines of just 7 percent and 11 percent compared to prior years.

“We were way up last year compared to the prior year, 38 percent after March had not changed much for several years. So that would be hard to meet. Also, I think we are starting to see (the impacts from loss of inventory).”

Further, Godwin noted that late March is typically a bit on the slow side and that a pair of Spring Breaks (from Michigan for one) included check-ins on the last days of March; that revenue will not show up until April numbers.

As for inventory, Godwin said it was difficult to pin down how much pre-storm inventory will return until later in the summer.

In addition, a significant amount of new construction has translated into many long-term rentals becoming short-term to accommodate construction workers.

“We’re thinking conservatively we are at 50 percent right now,” Godwin said. “By June and July we should start to get a better idea.”

To improve the numbers, the TDC is embarking on its last marketing campaigns funded via a $250,000 grant from Visit Florida.

Over the next two months, one social media campaign will revolve around “Design by Nature” and urging visitors to partner with residents in conserving the area’s natural resources.

There will be a heavier emphasis, she added, on Leave No Trace education.

“We want them to partner with us to help us keep this area natural and beautiful,” Godwin said.

This month there will also be a “pet” photo contest.

One part of the campaign will be filming Adrianna Glass of the TDC as she and her dog travel the county, with an emphasis on the county’s Leave No Trace and leash laws.

And, another aspect will be soliciting photos or videos from visitors or residents with their pets on an “adventure” out of doors.

“We have a lot of people who love their pets,” Godwin said.",https://www.starfl.com/news/20190509/six-months-into-fiscal-year-tdc-still-trending-on-budget?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T23:37:40Z,"The Star, Port St. Joe",Couple,"101 W Hwy 98, Port St Joe, FL 32456, USA",FL,32456
211,Documents detail 'severe injuries' in abuse of toddler; two face charges,"Clayton Pafford is one of two people charged in connection with the abuse of a toddler who suffered ""severe injuries."" The girl's mother, Heather Reid was also arrested. (Photo: Leon County Detention Facility)

The mother of a 2-year-old girl noticed injuries to her child every time she left her alone with her live-in boyfriend.

Leon County Sheriff’s Office investigators were made aware Monday of a possible child abuse incident when the girl was transported to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare with severe injuries.

Her brain was bleeding in two places. She had liver lacerations. Both her ears were bruised. She had cuts and abrasions on her hip, face and arms.

The girl’s mother, 26-year-old Heather Reid, was arrested after being questioned by detectives. She faces charges of child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm.

She told detectives she heard a thud come from the other room and believed the girl had fallen out of bed. After answering that only she and another man were at the house, she backtracked and said that her boyfriend, Clayton Pafford, was also home.

Heather Reid, 26, was arrested on charges of child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm. (Photo: Leon County Detention Facility)

She said Monday was not the first time she noticed the child with injuries.

“She noticed every time she leaves (her) alone with Clayton, she would return home and discover more injuries,” according to court records.

Reid said she didn't report previous injuries she believed were connected with Pafford because she was worried the toddler would be taken by the Florida Department of Children and Families.

The friend told LCSO he heard the same thud but that Reid wasn’t at the Crossway Court house when it happened. He saw Pafford, 23, come out of a bedroom with the toddler’s, bloody limp body. Pafford began calling Reid instead of for medical help.

The friend called 911 as Pafford left the home saying, “Don’t tell anyone I was here.”

Pafford, 23, was arrested Tuesday after leading law enforcement officials on a chase through Woodville. He faces charges of child neglect, aggravated battery on a child, kidnapping, hitting a police dog, aggravated assault of a police officer and multiple other charges stemming from fleeing officers.

LCSO deputies, along with members of the U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force and the Florida Highway Patrol, searched for Pafford all night. He was finally located at about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday driving on Back Forest Road by a member of LCSO’s Special Projects Investigations Detection Enforcement Response Unit and members of the Florida Highway Patrol. When they tried to stop him, Pafford refused to stop and fled.

Persuing deputies and troopers used stop sticks in the southbound travel lane of Old Woodville Highway, but Pafford swerved toward the deputy onto the St. Marks bike trail, narrowly missing him. Pafford turned back onto Old Woodville Highway and crossed over Bob Miller Road before troopers were able to stop his vehicle, LCSO reported.

Pafford, who had a passenger in his vehicle, refused to surrender. A LCSO K9 was used to take him into custody and after being treated at a local hospital was taken to the Leon County Detention Facility.

The couple was investigated by DCF last month when hospital staff noticed the toddler’s injuries.

In mid-April, staff at Capital Regional Medical Center noticed the girl was dirty, was covered in bug bites, had a bruise under her left eye and a bald spot on her head. The girl had a burn on her right hand and lesions on her body.

Staff members overheard Reid making alarming statements about not being able to take care of the girl and not caring if she was eating.

215,Brevard restaurants with outdoor seating cope with love bug swarms,"Marina and Mike Mauro choose to laugh about the lovebugs.

There's not much else the owners of The Burger Inn in Melbourne can do. Their '50s-style drive in relies on outdoor seating, and their white building is a siren call to swarms of insect couples.

It's laugh about the absurdity, or cry over lost business.

""The Burger Inn will be closed for the remainder of today due to an overwhelming abundance of lovebugs covering the restaurant. (Apparently the word is out that we have really good food and great service,"" Marina said in a Facebook post Monday afternoon.

""They're horrible,"" said Mike. ""They're crawling everywhere.""

They're back: Lovebugs are back. Many hate them. Experts say they're here for good

For most of us, the bugs are an annoyance, meaning multiple trips through the car wash, but for restaurants that rely on outdoor dining, the bugs can hit the cash register.

CLOSE Lovebugs, those pesky poor fliers are a nuisance but thankfully they are short-lived. Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

Coconuts on the Beach in Cocoa Beach closed two of its most popular outdoor areas Monday, said Angela Johnson, bar manager. That's about 150 seats that normally would have been filled.

""I let a lot of people go home yesterday that on a normal day would have never even considered,"" Johnson said.

The Mauros said they've seen about an 80 percent drop in business during the past couple of days.

Mustard's Last Stand on U.S. 1 in Melbourne didn't close, but saw a significant drop off in business. With only 10 indoor seats, server Georgia Paul said much of the business for the past couple of days has come from takeout orders.

""It's definitely cutting in on my drinking money,"" she said.

Monday seemed to bring the worst of it, the Mauros said. Tuesday, they reopened as usual at 10 a.m., though they didn't set up the outdoor tables. They were planning for mostly to-go orders.

""It is brutal,"" Marina said. ""I've lived in Florida 19 years, and I've never, ever seen it like this.""

In keeping with the theme, servers at The Burger Inn, which is just north of Eau Gallie Boulevard on U.S. 1, wear skirts. Monday's swarm meant the servers had lovebugs crawling up their legs and into their clothing.

""They're just crawling all over you,"" Marina said, ""in your eyes, in your ears, in your hair.

""It's the worst feeling, and you have two of them at once crawling on you.""

A lovebug remedy — putting water and baby oil in a white bucket — has been circulating online the past few days, and restaurant owners and managers are trying it.

""It was working,"" Johnson said, ""but there were so many lovebugs, that we would need 200 buckets. But it does work — it's not just an old wives tale —but not well enough.""

Marina Mauro said the same thing. Because their building is white and the bugs are drawn to white, the buckets of water couldn't keep up.

Marina said she could see a slight difference. They opened at 10 a.m., and planned to remain open until the normal 8 p.m. with servers wearing long pants and dark tops instead of skirts.

The Burger Inn had damage from the hail storm and closed for a week recently to replace the roof.

""We're going to hope we have some good days to make up for it,"" she said.

Johnson echoed that sentiment. Living in Florida is worth it, she said. And when it comes to the lovebugs, at least they'll be gone soon.

""I'm glad they're only two times a year,"" Johnson said.

216,Brevard restaurants with outdoor seating wage war against the love bugs,"Marina and Mike Mauro choose to laugh about the love bugs.

There's not much else the owners of The Burger Inn in Melbourne can do. Their '50s-style drive in relies on outdoor seating, and their white building is a siren call to swarms of insect lovers.

It's laugh about the absurdity, or cry over lost business.

""The Burger Inn will be closed for the remainder of today due to an overwhelming abundance of love bugs covering the restaurant. (Apparently the word is out that we have really good food and great service,"" Marina said in a Facebook post Monday afternoon.

""They're horrible,"" said Mike. ""They're crawling everywhere.""

They're back: Lovebugs are back. Many hate them. Experts say they're here for good

For most of us, the bugs are an annoyance, meaning multiple trips through the car wash, but for restaurants that rely on outdoor dining, the bugs can hit the cash register.

Coconuts on the Beach in Cocoa Beach closed two of its most popular outdoor areas Monday, said Angela Johnson, bar manager. That's about 150 seats that normally would have been filled.

""I let a lot of people go home yesterday that on a normal day would have never even considered,"" Johnson said.

The Mauros said they've seen about an 80 percent drop in business during the past couple of days.

Mustard's Last Stand on U.S. 1 in Melbourne didn't close, but saw a significant drop off in business. With only 10 indoor seats, server Georgia Paul said much of the business for the past couple of days has come from takeout orders.

""It's definitely cutting in on my drinking money,"" she said.

Monday seemed to bring the worst of it, the Mauros said. Tuesday, they reopened as usual at 10 a.m., though they didn't set up the outdoor tables. They were planning for mostly to-go orders.

""It is brutal,"" Marina said. ""I've lived in Florida 19 years, and I've never, ever seen it like this.""

In keeping with the theme, servers at The Burger Inn, which is just north of Eau Gallie Boulevard on U.S. 1, wear skirts. Monday's swarm meant the servers had love bugs crawling up their legs and into their clothing.

""They're just crawling all over you,"" Marina said, ""in your eyes, in your ears, in your hair.

""It's the worst feeling, and you have two of them at once crawling on you.""

A love bug remedy — putting water and baby oil in a white bucket — has been circulating online the past few days, and restaurant owners and managers are trying it.

A Sunday bike ride through an Ormond Beach park was anything but pleasant for a woman and her boyfriend.He said he rode right into a fishing line, tied off between a dock and a tree, that was at neck height.The man said he had to fall off his bike to avoid a possible life-threatening injury.The couple alerted police, who took a report and suggested it might have been homeless people in the woods using fishing line to dry clothes, but the couple feels certain this was no accident.""I'm lucky to walk away. It's just scary to think that something like that is out here,"" the man said.The man and his girlfriend asked WESH 2 News not to show their faces since they ride bikes in Central Park almost daily, and fear reprisal for sounding the alarm. But the victim showed WESH 2 News his neck with an angry red mark along his throat where fishing line tied across a path near the Joyce Ebbets Pier caught him. He had to fall off his bike to save himself.""It was burning, like somebody was like, taking fishing wire or something like that trying to decapitate me the whole time,"" he said.""All of a sudden, he goes down to the ground and I see the line come up out of his neck,"" the man's girlfriend said.His girlfriend shared a picture on social media with an arrow showing where the fishing line was located -- fishing line with a hook attached. It had rained, so the pair weren't riding too fast. If they had been riding faster or if the test line had been thicker, she thinks the outcome could have been far more serious.""He could have gone right through it, and it could have taken his head off in all reality,"" she said.Both are sure the fishing line was placed along the path deliberately.It was intentional. There's no way that this could have been somebody's fishing line that got hung up on the dock and they just walked with it because it would have been laying on the ground. It was strung up at neck height on purpose.:Police did a search and didn't find any more possible booby traps.The couple just wants other people in the area to be aware.

218,Resilient: NWF State student graduates at 47,"BAKER — Amy Tolar was told by her own mother that she would never amount to anything.

“My mom told me, ‘You are not even going to graduate high school, you’re not smart enough,’ Tolar said. “My mom didn’t care, she wasn’t in my life very much as a child.”

However, the now 47-year-old has proven that not only was she smart enough to gain a high school diploma, but she had the resilience to fight through adversity to earn her bachelors degree in management supervision from Northwest Florida State College.

Tolar walked alongside about 550 other graduates at Saturday's 54th annual commencement at the Raider Arena on the Niceville campus.

In 1990, during her senior year in high school, Tolar said she left her childhood home. She moved to Fort Walton Beach and graduated from Choctawhatchee High School the same year.

In 1997, Tolar began working toward an associates degree at what was then called Okaloosa-Walton Community College, but life got in the way. Eventually, she met and married Jeffery “JT” Tolar, and in 2001, the newly-wed military couple moved to Italy.

When the military brought the couple back to Fort Walton Beach, and her husband retired, Tolar once again began pursuing higher education. Tolar finally earned her Associates of Accounting Degree from Northwest Florida State College in May of 2011, however, shortly afterwards, she got word that her sister had taken her own life.

“My first day of class at the University of West Florida, is when my sister committed suicide,” Tolar said. “After that I stopped pursing my education for a while.”

Tolar then poured herself into her job in financial management on Hurlburt and Eglin Air Force Bases, but was finally drawn back to her life-long dream of gaining a bachelor’s degree thanks to a good friend, Nicole Allen.

“I started back to school in May 2017, which was when Nicole got her (bachelors) degree,” Tolar said. “She was my main motivator to get it done because she did it having two children working full-time as a mom and wife.”

After two more years of successes and even more life setbacks, Tolar was finally cleared to graduate just three days before Saturday's ceremony.

“It took me 29 years after high school to get this so I feel relief and a lot of weight lifted off my shoulders,"" she said. ""I am the only one on my side of the family to even get a degree.”

Her accomplishment was all the more sweet because Tolar’s stepdaughter Autumn will also be graduating this month with a law degree from Barry University in Orlando.

“I’m so proud of her endurance,” Tolar said. “I want to encourage those out there to just stay steady to your goals and endure the journey that you are on. Keep it focused, one day at a time.”",https://www.waltonsun.com/news/20190507/resilient-nwf-state-student-graduates-at-47?rssfeed=true,2019-05-07T11:42:14Z,The Walton Sun,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
219,Smoke detectors alert couple to morning fire in St. Lucie County home,"ST. LUCIE COUNTY — Smoke detectors are credited with saving the lives of two people in a Tuesday morning fire, according to the St. Lucie County Fire District.

Crews about 6:45 a.m. Tuesday went to a fire at a home on San Roberto, which is west of Turnpike Feeder Road and north of Indrio Road in the Lakewood Park area.

221,Sargent: The day I fished with former Florida Gators coach Ray Graves,"Florida coach Ray Graves confers with quarterback Steve Spurrier at the 1967 Orange Bowl against Georgia Tech. Graves, who helped the Gators reach national prominence in the 1960s, died in April 2015. He was 96. (Photo: AP file)

It was early in June 1970 when ex-Florida Gators Coach Ray Graves made a stop in Melbourne for a talk at the Gators’ Boosters Club. Knowing that he was an avid bass fisherman, having fished all his life, including the many ponds and lakes around Gainesville, I called him and asked if he’d like to try for some bass on the St. Johns River for a couple hours the next morning.

“Where can I meet ya,” he half-yelled over the phone.

Just months before Graves had turned over the Gators coaching duties to Doug Dickey after Florida’s 1969 Gator Bowl win over Tennessee, ending Graves’ 10-year tenure as the Gators’ coach. Under Graves, the Gators made five bowl appearances and compiled a 70-31-4 record. Graves remained the UF athletic director until 1979.

Our morning trip on the river started early at Camp Holly on the river west of Melbourne. With dawn flushing the cloudless eastern sky we headed our cypress camp boat toward Lake Sawgrass, the first major lake on the river south of U.S. 192.

The following is how our day went, as reported in my June 13, 1970 column in TODAY, the forerunner of FLORIDA TODAY.

(Photo: The Associated Press)

“Looks good, looks good,” said Graves, scanning the expanse of thousands of lily pads across the surface of Lake Sawgrass. “I like fishing the pads.”

Already Graves had lit up a six-inch cigar and it was clamped tightly in his jaw.

A slight breeze from the southwest sent ripples over the boat trails that ran like channels through the pads.

“We’ll head down to the far end and drift back,” I said over the hum of the small outboard as Graves puffed on the cigar. “Good plan. It oughta drift us right along,” he answered.

Relaxed and enjoying the moment, you could almost see the visions of lunker bass dancing in his head.

As we came to a stop on the south end of the lake, Graves stood and picked up one of his rods. He never left home without his fishing tackle. “Hate to do it to ya,” he chuckled with his touch of native Tennessee drawl, “but I’ll catch that first bass while you’re riggin’ up.”

Each of Graves’ three rods featured identical 5000 Ambassadeur casting reels and he grabbed the one rigged with a yellow-and-red Splatterbug top-water plug and began making pinpoint casts into open pockets in the broad-leafed pads. He was a dead-eye caster.

I followed with a top-water frog-colored Nip-I-Diddee.

We worked a broad area for a good 30 minutes, during the best fishing time of the day, with no strikes.

“Wonder what’s wrong,” Graves queried, his cigar now having died of its red embers on the metal seat beside him.

“There’s gotta be bass in here, everything’s perfect,” he reassured himself out loud.

“I’ll try a worm,” I said, replacing the Nip-I-Diddee.

Still no luck.

I paddled from one patch of pads to another for close to an hour, never seeing any surface activity. It was as though Sawgrass was void of bass, even though I knew differently.

“Think a Johnson spoon with a pork chunk will work?” I asked, glancing at Graves, noticing the morning sun accenting his silver hair protruding from under a light grey parka pulled over a deep blue Gator Coaching Staff knit shirt.

“Might. Give it a try.”

No strikes.

“Water’s gettin’ deeper out here near the middle,” Graves said, his voice with an air of optimism. “Deep water always means bass.

“This one’ll get ‘em,” he half snorted, picking up another of his rods with a small spinnerbait attached. “This is a bass killer, best bait I’ve ever fished. I’ve caught more bass on this bait than anything I’ve ever fished.”

“What’s it called.”

“Silver Doctor. Had a hard time findin’ this one. Used to fish them all the time years ago but couldn’t buy ‘em anywhere. Found this one down at Doc’s Hardware in Gainesville. He probably had ‘em all the time.”

He worked the spinnerbait slow and close to the surface, with his rod tip held high.

“Care if I flyrod a little, coach?”

“Not a bit. Maybe that’s what they hittin,” Graves answered.

“Okay,” I thought, “chartreuse Boone popping bug do your stuff.”

Twenty minutes of working the popper tight to the edges of the pads proved fruitless.

Peculiar enough, despite the rising sun, a light blanket of mist coming off the water from the shaded east side of the lake was moving our way.

“Maybe this is what they’re waitin’ for,” Graves envisioned.

The words were no more than out of his mouth when BANG.

“Hey, what did I tell ya,” Graves yelled. “Got one.”

“Hold him, coach.”

The fish jumped. It was best it hadn’t.

“Mudfish. Good-for-nothin’ mudfish,” Graves growled. “Didn’t think he hit like a bass,” he added reaching down with pliers to retrieve his Silver Doctor from the fish’s mouth.

I was downright embarrassed that the bass weren’t hitting knowing Graves’ years of experience. He and Georgia Tech’s Bobby Dodd fished together many times, once going to Cuba where they caught 300 bass a day. Over the years, Graves caught three bass over 13 pounds and one summer he totaled 37 bass over 10 pounds, all in lakes around Gainesville.

“That was a sweet summer,” he chuckled.

But there was nothing sweet about our luck this day.

“Let’s fish down on that far end,” Graves said, nodding toward the north end of Lake Sawgrass.

Bingo!

Graves’ first cast brought a strike.

“Told ya, they’re in here. Not very big but it’s a bass,” he said, now upbeat, estimating the bass at 1 ¼-pounds as he grabbed it by the lower jaw.

“Told ya that Silver Doctor would catch bass,” he grinned.

It would be the one and only bass of the day.

It was beginning to get hot and I knew Graves was due at a noon luncheon, so we made a few more casts before calling it quits.

“You know, I bet my wife Opal would have outfished us today,” Graves grinned. “She caught a 13½-pounder last year, ya know. But we had a good time. That’s what matters.

“Guess sometimes you win some, sometimes you lose some,” he added philosophically, unwrapping another cigar for the ride back to the camp.

222,End could be in sight for Visit Florida,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Florida’s tourism-marketing agency is closer to having its doors closed this fall as a Senate budget proposal Tuesday matched the House’s stance to eliminate Visit Florida.

Sen. Travis Hutson, a St. Augustine Republican who oversees tourism and economic-development funding, said there is no reason to push for additional money until the House takes up a Senate-approved bill (SB 178) that would extend the life of Visit Florida beyond Oct. 1.

“If Visit Florida is going to sunset, there is no reason to agree any further than that,” said Hutson, who chairs the Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development Appropriations Subcommittee.

And so far, the House isn’t rushing to take up the Senate bill. Under state law, Visit Florida is authorized to continue operating through Sept. 30. Without legislation such as the Senate bill, the agency will go away.

House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes, said late Tuesday that he wouldn’t “discount completely” the House taking up the bill, which was never heard in a House committee. But he also didn’t raise the prospects that the bill would be heard with a little more than a week remaining in the 60-day legislative session.

“At this point, it’s going to be a little more difficult because we never took up that bill,” Oliva said.

House leaders have attacked past spending by Visit Florida, and Oliva on Tuesday night dismissed concerns that Florida’s tourism figures would be impacted without the agency’s promotional efforts.

“I would point those people to the world before Visit Florida ever existed. I would point to fluctuations in the funding of Visit Florida and how they in no way correlate to the fluctuations in our tourism,” Oliva said. “And I would also point out to them, what we found in the last couple of years is that a great deal of that money was not even being used to promote Florida. So, whatever amount of money was being used to promote Florida, was not having a direct correlation on tourism.”

House members have continued to focus on spending by Visit Florida. The agency was particularly in the crosshairs of lawmakers in 2017 because of spending that included a $11.6 million deal to sponsor a cooking show hosted by celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse, a $2.875 million contract with an auto-racing team known as Visit Florida Racing, and a $1 million promotion contract with Miami rapper Pitbull.

Oliva added that the economy, along with Florida’s weather and attractions, have a bigger impact on the state’s tourism numbers than the marketing efforts of Visit Florida.

“In a trillion-dollar economy, a few million dollars put towards advertising a few different places cannot possibly have a direct correlation with tourism,” Oliva said.

“There’s a whole series of factors. Visit Florida is probably least among them,” he concluded.

The agency has reported eight years of record tourism numbers, topped by 126.1 million visitors in 2018. In the same time, the agency’s share of state funding has grown from $35 million in 2011, when the state counted 87.3 million visitors, to $76 million in the current year.

Proponents of Visit Florida point to its ability to counter negative national media when areas are impacted by disasters such as hurricanes and last summer’s red tide outbreak.

Unless something changes in upcoming budget negotiations, Hutson said Visit Florida would get $17 million in the 2019-2020 fiscal year, enough to cover its expenses until Oct. 1.

The Senate had earlier proposed $50 million for the agency, $26 million less than requested by Gov. Ron DeSantis. That would allow operations to continue beyond Oct. 1.

The Senate-approved bill would allow the Florida Tourism Industry Marketing Corporation, better known as Visit Florida, to continue operating until Oct. 1, 2027.

“If Visit Florida is going to sunset, there is no reason to agree any further than that,” said Hutson, who chairs the Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development Appropriations Subcommittee.

And so far, the House isn’t rushing to take up the Senate bill. Under state law, Visit Florida is authorized to continue operating through Sept. 30. Without legislation such as the Senate bill, the agency will go away.

House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes, said late Tuesday that he wouldn’t “discount completely” the House taking up the bill, which was never heard in a House committee. But he also didn’t raise the prospects that the bill would be heard with a little more than a week remaining in the 60-day legislative session.

“At this point, it’s going to be a little more difficult because we never took up that bill,” Oliva said.

House leaders have attacked past spending by Visit Florida, and Oliva on Tuesday night dismissed concerns that Florida’s tourism figures would be impacted without the agency’s promotional efforts.

“I would point those people to the world before Visit Florida ever existed. I would point to fluctuations in the funding of Visit Florida and how they in no way correlate to the fluctuations in our tourism,” Oliva said. “And I would also point out to them, what we found in the last couple of years is that a great deal of that money was not even being used to promote Florida. So, whatever amount of money was being used to promote Florida, was not having a direct correlation on tourism.”

House members have continued to focus on spending by Visit Florida. The agency was particularly in the crosshairs of lawmakers in 2017 because of spending that included a $11.6 million deal to sponsor a cooking show hosted by celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse, a $2.875 million contract with an auto-racing team known as Visit Florida Racing, and a $1 million promotion contract with Miami rapper Pitbull.

Oliva added that the economy, along with Florida’s weather and attractions, have a bigger impact on the state’s tourism numbers than the marketing efforts of Visit Florida.

“In a trillion-dollar economy, a few million dollars put towards advertising a few different places cannot possibly have a direct correlation with tourism,” Oliva said.

“There’s a whole series of factors. Visit Florida is probably least among them,” he concluded.

The agency has reported eight years of record tourism numbers, topped by 126.1 million visitors in 2018. In the same time, the agency’s share of state funding has grown from $35 million in 2011, when the state counted 87.3 million visitors, to $76 million in the current year.

Proponents of Visit Florida point to its ability to counter negative national media when areas are impacted by disasters such as hurricanes and last summer’s red tide outbreak.

Unless something changes in upcoming budget negotiations, Hutson said Visit Florida would get $17 million in the 2019-2020 fiscal year, enough to cover its expenses until Oct. 1.

The Senate had earlier proposed $50 million for the agency, $26 million less than requested by Gov. Ron DeSantis. That would allow operations to continue beyond Oct. 1.

The Senate-approved bill would allow the Florida Tourism Industry Marketing Corporation, better known as Visit Florida, to continue operating until Oct. 1, 2027.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190424/end-could-be-near-for-visit-florida?rssfeed=true,2019-04-24T08:26:21Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608

233,Documents detail 'severe injuries' in abuse of toddler,"The mother of a 2-year-old girl noticed injuries to her child every time she left her alone with her live-in boyfriend.

Leon County Sheriff’s Office investigators were made aware Monday of a possible child abuse incident when the girl was transported to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare with severe injuries.

Clayton Pafford is one of two people charged in connection with the abuse of a toddler who suffered ""severe injuries."" The girl's mother, Heather Reid was also arrested. (Photo: Leon County Detention Facility)

Her brain was bleeding in two places. She had liver lacerations. Both her ears were bruised. She had cuts and abrasions on her hip, face and arms.

The girl’s mother, 26-year-old Heather Reid, was arrested after being questioned by detectives. She faces charges child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm.

She told detectives she heard a thud come from the other room and believed the girl had fallen out of bed. After answering that only she and another man were at the house, she backtracked and said that her boyfriend, Clayton Pafford, was also home.

She said Monday was not the first time she noticed the child with injuries.

“She noticed every time she leaves (her) alone with Clayton, she would return home and discover more injuries,” according to court records.

Reid said she didn't report previous injuries she believed were connected with Pafford because she was worried the toddler would be taken by the Florida Department of Children and Families.

The friend told LCSO he heard the same thud but that Reid wasn’t at the Crossway Court house when it happened. He saw Pafford, 23, come out of a bedroom with the toddler’s, bloody limp body. Pafford began calling Reid instead of for medical help.

The friend called 911 as Pafford left the home saying, “Don’t tell anyone I was here.”

Pafford, 23, was arrested Tuesday after leading law enforcement officials on a chase through Woodville. He faces charges of child neglect, aggravated battery on a child, kidnapping, hitting a police dog, kidnapping, aggravated assault of a police officer and multiple other charges stemming from fleeing officers.

LCSO deputies, along with members of the U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force and the Florida Highway Patrol, searched for Pafford all night. He was finally located at about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday driving on Back Forest Road by a member of LCSO’s Special Projects Investigations Detection Enforcement Response Unit and members of the Florida Highway Patrol. When they tried to stop him, Pafford refused to stop and fled.

Persuing deputies and troopers used stop sticks in the southbound travel lane of Old Woodville Highway, but Pafford swerved toward the deputy onto the St. Marks bike trail, narrowly missing him. Pafford turned back onto Old Woodville Highway and crossed over Bob Miller Road before troopers were able to stop his vehicle, LCSO reported.

Pafford, who had a passenger in his vehicle, refused to surrender. A LCSO K9 was used to take him into custody and after being treated at a local hospital was taken to the Leon County Detention Facility.

The couple was investigated by DCF last month when hospital staff noticed the toddler’s injuries.

In mid-April, staff at Capital Regional Medical Center noticed the girl was dirty, was covered in bug bites, had a bruise under her left eye and a bald spot on her head. The girl had a burn on her right hand and lesions on her body. Staff members overheard Reid making alarming statements about not being about to take care of the girl and not caring if she was eating.

235,Emergency hearing resumes today for Hillsborough toddler at center of medical custody battle,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Noah McAdams

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - An emergency hearing has been scheduled for 8 a.m. Tuesday morning regarding a Hillsborough toddler at the center of a medical custody battle.

Noah McAdams is currently battling leukemia.

However, his parents do not want him to undergo traditional chemotherapy treatment.

Instead, they want his cancer treated with a more organic approach, one that includes medical-grade cannabis.

Noah has already received two chemo treatments at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, according to family members.

The child's parents, Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball, are now taking their fight to court, hoping the state will allow them to treat their son's cancer using homeopathic methods, not chemotherapy.

The family maintains that's what they were doing when they left Hillsborough County last Monday with their 3-year-old son, sparking a multi-state search. The parents claim they were seeking a second opnion, searching for an alternative to chemo.

The family was eventually found safe in Kentucky.

Authorities put out urgent alerts for Noah, saying the boy was in need of ""lifesaving medical care.""

Hillsborough County deputies said the parents failed to bring their son to a medically-necessary hospital procedure last week, then refused to follow up with additional lifesaving medical care.

""We just want of the therapies less drastic than chemotherapy,"" Noah's mother said.

The parents have temporarily lost custody of their son and now he's staying with his grandparents.

""These parents are absolutely not looking to let their kid suffer, they're going to treat this child,"" said Michael Minardi, the attorney representing Noah's parents.

The couple tells News Channel 8 they absolutely do not want chemotherapy for their child, insisting that other treatments be considered.

""I want my son home and for him to be treated with a treatment that is not going to damage his little body so much,"" said Noah's mom.

The parents want to use medical cannabis, CBD oils, vitamins and a strict diet to treat Noah's cancer.

The couple tells us they're not opposed to treatment, they just want to do it differently.

""We want him to be treated with something that has less side effects,"" Noah's mother said. ""Chemotherapy is so brutal on a body.""

On Tuesday after the court hearing , Noah's mom said her son is stressed out since he is separated from them.

""As of yesterday you can tell that he is severely traumatized by all of this, by being separated from us. He has never been separated from us this long and been restricted to when he can and cannot see his parents,"" said Taylor Bland-Ball, mother.

Since no decision was reached on Tuesday, she is hopeful the family still has a chance to get what they want.

""I am really thankful that the judge didn't make a decision today. That she is allowing more witnesses to come in, that she is allowing more information to be exposed about this treatment, said Bland-Ball.

The hearing resumes at 8 a.m. Wednesday.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/emergency-hearing-resumes-today-for-hillsborough-toddler-at-center-of-medical-custody-battle/1988311726,2019-05-08T08:44:49Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

238,Pensacola Beach marketing 101: Don't show older visitors in ads,"Among the many tips those in the Pensacola tourism industry received Tuesday about how to best market Pensacola Beach was this one: don't feature older people in beach advertising or marketing materials.

""You don't want to show people who are too old,""Jeff Shusterman of Opinion Market Research told the group gathered for a marketing trends workshop hosted by Visit Pensacola.

Shusterman presented detailed market research complied by his company based on 2018 visitation to the Pensacola area. He said potential vacationers prefer to see photos of younger people.

Other tips from Shusterman based on his research include always showing people in beach clothes and on uncrowded beaches.

""No matter what time of year it is, show that it's warm,"" he said.

And potential visitors love photos of colorful and unique food, especially on the beach, Shusterman said.

Steve Hayes, director of Visit Pensacola, said he gets why the message about not featuring older people in advertising might offend some people. But he said the information came from focus groups that included older people.

""They preferred to see photos of younger people,"" he said.

Hayes said the advertising images reflect how people see themselves on vacation.

""You want to see what you want to be, not what you are,"" he said.

Dick Appleyard, president of the Appleyard Agency, helped develop some of the Pensacola marketing information. Appleyard said potential visitors don't want see photos of people who ""look like me.""

""If you are targeting my generation, you don't show a snowbird in the ad, you show a younger demographic,"" he said.

But some Pensacola Beach visitors who are part of Appleyard's generation didn't agree with that message Tuesday afternoon.

Rich Defeno, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Penny, waded along the water’s edge wearing matching blue swimwear.

The Andalusia, Alabama, couple said they didn’t take offense to marketing officials not wanting to feature couples like them in their campaigns, but they thought they were “missing out” by not targeting the older generation.

“We’re still vibrant,” she said. “I’m 57, he’s 62, but we get out, we rent things, we stay places and we buy stuff. We spend a lot of money when we come here. But we always have fun.”

Orange County deputies arrested 45-year-old Kristen Kelly.

The family says Kelly was yelling religious slurs and driving recklessly on their property.

The victims say they believe they were targets because they are Jewish.

""I think the world's changed a little bit and I think people think they're entitled to say and do things that are inappropriate.""

Kelly is charged with aggravated assault, burglary, as well as a hate crime. The family says it was a humiliating experience and they hope it won't happen again.

A Sunday bike ride through an Ormond Beach park was anything but pleasant for a woman and her boyfriend.He said he rode right into a fishing line, tied off between a dock and a tree, that was at neck height.The man said he had to fall off his bike to avoid a possible life-threatening injury.The couple alerted police, who took a report and suggested it might have been homeless people in the woods using fishing line to dry clothes, but the couple feels certain this was no accident.""I'm lucky to walk away. It's just scary to think that something like that is out here,"" the man said.The man and his girlfriend asked WESH 2 News not to show their faces since they ride bikes in Central Park almost daily, and fear reprisal for sounding the alarm. But the victim showed WESH 2 News his neck with an angry red mark along his throat where fishing line tied across a path near the Joyce Ebbets Pier caught him. He had to fall off his bike to save himself.""It was burning, like somebody was like, taking fishing wire or something like that trying to decapitate me the whole time,"" he said.""All of a sudden, he goes down to the ground and I see the line come up out of his neck,"" the man's girlfriend said.His girlfriend shared a picture on social media with an arrow showing where the fishing line was located -- fishing line with a hook attached.

243,How a hurricane season forecast is prepared,"There is a lot of behind the scene preparation that goes into a hurricane forecast prepared by meteorologists before it hits your eyes.First we look at what is happening with weather patterns like El Nino and La Nina. These as you know give us a broad idea of how active a hurricane season maybe. During El Nino years, we usually see a less active season. La Nina years often mean an uptick in tropical systems.We then closely monitor the Saharan dust layer that comes off Africa. Hurricanes do not like this layer of dry air, which can kill a storm or even deter one from developing all together.Next, sea surface temperatures play an important role in forecasting the strength of a storm.

There is a lot of behind the scene preparation that goes into a hurricane forecast prepared by meteorologists before it hits your eyes.

First we look at what is happening with weather patterns like El Nino and La Nina. These as you know give us a broad idea of how active a hurricane season maybe. During El Nino years, we usually see a less active season. La Nina years often mean an uptick in tropical systems.

We then closely monitor the Saharan dust layer that comes off Africa. Hurricanes do not like this layer of dry air, which can kill a storm or even deter one from developing all together.

Next, sea surface temperatures play an important role in forecasting the strength of a storm. The hotter the ocean, the more intense a storm could be.

245,"Prince Harry embodies every proud new dad, offers sweet words about wife, son","Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks to the media at Windsor Castle on Monday following the birth of his son (Steve Parsons - WPA Pool/Getty Images).

The newest member of the royal family has arrived: a son, born to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the duke and duchess of Sussex.

Prince Harry stepped away from royal father duty just briefly to speak with members of the media.

“This little thing is absolutely to die for, so I’m just over the moon,” he told reporters Monday outside Frogmore Cottage, the couple’s home not far from Windsor Castle, according to published reports. “Mother and baby are doing incredibly well. It’s been the most amazing experience I can ever possibly imagine. How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension, and we’re both absolutely thrilled.”

This marks the first interracial baby in the monarchy’s recent history. The newborn sits just behind Prince Harry in line to the British throne -- in the seventh spot. It’s unclear if he’ll get a royal title.

The baby, whose name still hasn’t been announced, arrived at 5:26 a.m. May 6. Prince Harry was said to have been there, and then the royals announced the birth on a recently created Instagram account a short time later.

The infant weighs 7 pounds, 3 ounces.

Markle’s mother, Doria Ragland, is with the couple as well at Frogmore Cottage.

The royal pregnancy was announced in October 2018, and for months, people only knew the couple were due in spring 2019. Eventually, Markle told the public when she was six months along, meaning we were able to assume the baby would arrive in late April or early May.

Prince Harry and Markle are coming up on their one-year anniversary, as they wed in May 2018.

“More details will be shared in the forthcoming days,” the Instagram post announcing the birth says.

246,Ex-LPD Chief Larry Giddens withdraws Florida Southern College application following anti-gay slur complaint from Lakeland PD lieutenant,"Former Lakeland Police Chief Larry Giddens was accused of telling a LPD lieutenant he looked like a ""f------ f-----."" Giddens was to become Florida Southern's head of security at the end of May.

LAKELAND — Former Lakeland Police Chief Larry Giddens has withdrawn his application as head of security at Florida Southern College following accusations he called a Lakeland Police Department lieutenant an anti-gay slur when they encountered each other while riding bikes.

Giddens told Lt. Eric Harper he looked like a ""f------ f-----,"" Harper told The Ledger earlier this week.

Giddens, who served as police chief for five years, withdrew from the top security job at FSC on Wednesday, according to sources. A college official, who declined to be named, confirmed the news but declined to elaborate further.

Harper, who has worked at the department for more than 16 years, said he reported the slur to Florida Southern College's director of human resources on April 15.

""It was a derogatory homophobic slur,"" Harper said. ""You just can't talk like that.""

Harper said he fired back at the chief after the insult.

""Larry, the P.D. is a better place with you gone,"" Harper said he told Giddens.

Giddens could not be reached for comment.

He had been hired by Florida Southern to begin work as director of campus safety at the end of May. He retired from the police department in February.

He told the Ledger in January that he was excited Florida Southern had chosen him as the new head of security.

""I think it’s a great school, a very professional college and I look forward to it,"" Giddens told the Ledger after he had announced his pending retirement.

But a month after he retired, a complaint was filed by former LPD Sgt. Pat Guity accusing Giddens and then current LPD attorney Donna Perry of violating numerous policies, including fraternization and untruthfulness when the two were accused of becoming involved in a romantic relationship.

Perry, 38, is no longer with the department. She signed a $17,296 severance package April 2 after working at the police department for six months.

The Ledger learned of Harper's complaint earlier this week when it received a tip by a third party.

Harper and LPD Detective Eddie Mingus said they were off-duty riding bikes on April 13 with dozens of others on the Fort Fraser Trail.

Mingus told Harper he saw Giddens riding during a previous weekend and the former chief had been somewhat standoffish and looked angry. He warned Harper that Giddens may be on the ride and mentioned his previous testiness.

""The plan was not to say anything,"" Harper said.

As Mingus and Harper prepared to ride, the two said Giddens glared at them.

Harper said his relationship with Giddens had been professional but tense at times during work.

""He could be overbearing,"" Harper said, mentioning that he would question Giddens when he disagreed with something.

Giddens pulled in front of the two as everyone started to ride in a tight group, Harper said.

But he soon slowed down and pulled next to Harper, placing the lieutenant in the middle between Giddens and Mingus.

Harper said he felt Giddens' glare, but chose not to speak to him. Then, Harper said Giddens told him he looked like a ""f------ f-----.""

Mingus confirmed he heard the slur.

""He never said he was kidding,"" Harper said.

Harper said he thought about it a couple of days before going to the college.

""People needed to know what he said,"" Harper said.

247,Junior Achievement of Southwest Florida adds three to its Hall of Fame,"Three more entrepreneurs can now call themselves hall-of-famers in Southwest Florida.

The founder of a check printing business and longtime restaurateurs are the latest to join Junior Achievement of Southwest Florida's Business Hall of Fame.

For their business success and service as role models to youth and their peers, and their commitment to the community, Dave Copham and Scott and Diana Willis, are the latest to receive the special recognition.

The trio of winners were honored as laureates and inducted into the Hall of Fame during a ceremony Thursday night at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point in Bonita Springs.

Hundreds attended the ceremony, including students and business and community leaders.

The annual event raises money to support Junior Achievement's mission.

Junior Achievement reaches thousands of students with its programs in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties every year, providing them with mentorship opportunities and classes on such topics as financial literacy and career and work readiness.

Locally, the organization partnered with more than 200 classroom business volunteers during the 2017-2018 school, providing nearly 63,800 hours of instruction to more than 11,600 students in 519 classes.

The three laureates join dozens of others who have been named to the Hall of Fame in Southwest Florida since the recognition program began in 1988.

Laureates don't have to be involved in Junior Achievement, but they do have to be involved in the community.

Here's a look at this year's inductees:

Dave Copham

In 1985 Copham founded Liberty Check Printers. The company, headquartered in Mounds View, Minnesota, grew to become a leading supplier of personal checks for credit unions in the United States.

You're almost signed up for Breaking News Keep an eye out for an email to confirm your newsletter registration. More newsletters

Recognizing an industry-wide slowdown in the use of paper checks, Copham diversified the company, adding marketing services, education and e-commerce solutions, offered primarily to credit unions.

In June 2005 the company was acquired by one of its biggest rivals, the John H. Harland Co., for $160 million in an all-cash deal.

At the time of the acquisition, Copham and his family owned about 80 percent of the company, with the remainder owned by employees through an Employee Stock Option Plan, or ESOP.

Under Copham's direction, the business became the first S-corporation to offer stock to employees through an ESOP, which the law didn't allow before 1998.

With an S-Corporation shareholders don't pay self-employment taxes on their share of the company's profits. They're only taxed on the salary they pay themselves.

Originally from Minnesota, Copham began his career in 1967 as a pressman helper at Holden Business Forms, where he worked his way up the ladder to become a vice president of manufacturing.

Later Copham served as vice president of operations at Northstar Computer Forms for more than a decade. In that role he discovered the need for a check printing business, and he jumped on the opportunity.

Liberty Check grew by leaps and bounds — ultimately employing more than 1,000 workers across the country.

During Copham's 20 years of leadership, Liberty Check earned many awards and honors, including being named one of Minnesota’s top 100 employers in 1997 by Minnesota Business Magazine.

In 1996, Ernst & Young named Copham Entrepreneur of the Year in manufacturing for the Dakotas and Minnesota.

Copham met and married his wife Cheryl in 1965. They raised two children together, Kristen Mae and Jed. Today, the retired couple splits their time between Florida and Minnesota.

The Cophams support many charities here and elsewhere including SWFL Children’s Charities Inc., The Heights Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, Pace Center for Girls, Special Equestrian Inc., Naples Children & Education Foundation and the Mayo Foundation.

In his acceptance speech, Copham credited his success to his wife and his employees. Two former Liberty executives attended the ceremony.

Addressing the students in the audience, Copham said: ""While challenges seem almost insurmountable at times, in retrospect they pale by comparison to the very founding of our great Republic, our Bill of Rights and Constitution, the abolition of slavery, championing women's suffrage, surviving a Great Depression and two World Wars, civil rights won, surviving the resignation of a president and the events of 9/11. We have overcome and with future leaders like you young people, we will continue.""

He warned those future leaders about taking certain positions.

""It has been said only fools and fanatics are always so adamant about their opinions, whereas wise people are full of doubts, but use those doubts to create curiosity, curiosity to drive knowledge and knowledge to enhance the decision-making process.""

In closing he offered this piece of advice: ""Work hard, enjoy your life and be a constant learner. So, when you are old like me you can say like the Apostle Paul to his protégé Timothy, 'I have fought the good fight, I have run the race, I have kept the faith.'""

Scott and Diana Willis

Known for their people-driven approach to business and their generosity to charitable organizations, the Willises are owner-operators of Jason’s Deli of Southwest Florida. The couple has six successful stores in the region and they've earned several honors from the national chain, including Franchise of the Year in 2005 and 2013.

In 2014 the franchise received four Consumers' Choice Awards, including the top award for Availability of Healthy Options among fast-casual restaurants from research firm Technomic. Award winners are chosen based on customer traffic and feedback, as well as sales performance and market share.

The Willises operate stores from Sarasota to Naples, with more than 250 employees throughout the region.

The couple opened their first location in December 2001.

At 20 years old, Scott Willis began his career in the restaurant industry as a store manager for a McDonald’s franchisee. He quickly rose up the ranks to become a supervisor of 13 McDonald’s locations in Texas.

Scott and Diana Willis became business partners in their own McDonald’s franchise in Arkansas before selling it and launching Jason’s Deli of Southwest Florida.

Committed to improving the lives of others, the Willises serve as mentors within their company and the community through various philanthropic organizations. They support many nonprofits including the Abuse Counseling and Treatment Center, the American Heart Association, the Children’s Advocacy Center, Habitat for Humanity, and the Harry Chapin Food Bank.

Diana Willis sits on the Dean’s Council for Florida Gulf Coast University’s Lutgert College of Business. She previously served as the chairwoman of the advisory board for the university's School of Resort and Hospitality Management.

In 2015 she earned the Greater Fort Myers Chamber’s Women in Business committee's Apex Award, which recognizes outstanding women in the community who excel in the areas of professionalism, philanthropy and leadership.

Diana Willis was Gulfshore Life magazine’s 2015 Woman of the Year. In 2018 she received the Jon Davidson Humanitarian Award from Jason’s Deli for her efforts in partnering with the community for a better tomorrow.

Married for 32 years, Scott and Diana Willis have two sons, Brandon and Mason.

The couple met nearly 40 years ago in April 1980. In their acceptance speech, he said, ""It's been a compromise ever since.""

""Yes, we have come a long way,"" she added. ""Never in our wildest dreams did we think we would earn the title of laureate.""

The couple thanked the long list of people who helped them get where they are today including their sons, who Diana Willis said have ""given us the best opportunity to learn and hone our leadership skills in the very best way.""

When they moved to Southwest Florida to start their Jason’s Deli business in 2000, leaving McDonald's after more than 20 years, the Willises took a big risk, she said, but it's that risk that paved the opportunity for growth and a brighter future.

""Life is full of second chances, if you take them,"" he said.

The couple has always rooted for the underdog.

""Whether it was taking in a friend of Mason’s, a young man he played Lacrosse with, to live with us as a senior in high school, or making a commitment to a young woman who was going through a tough time and being there for her for more than 10 years, we never give up on others,"" Diana Willis said.

While neither of them graduated from college, she said they've never stopped learning and she encouraged the students listening in the audience to do the same.

She told the future leaders to set goals, to take ownership in all they do, to choose to shine, to accept failures as a growth opportunity, to hold themselves to the highest standard — and not to let others define their success.

Most importantly, she said is to ""do all things with great love,"" and to surround yourself with the people you love and the people who love you.

""Love is the greatest power,"" she said.

248,Cape Coral couple bests Florida record after catching 'Jurassic' swordfish,"CLOSE After an 8-hour fight, a 757.8 pound female swordfish caught off Islamorada appears to have bested Florida’s official champion by more than 140 pounds Amy Bennett Williams, awilliams@news-press.com

A Cape Coral couple had the first-ever swordfishing trip of a lifetime last month, landing a massive female specimen weighing in well above Florida’s official record. But Debbie and Bill Lussier haven’t decided to hassle with the paperwork to get their catch certified – they were just out scouting some new fishing fun, Debbie said.

After the better part of two lifetimes spent fish-hunting in Maine, the Lussiers, both retired fishing captains, were ready for a change. Cape Coral residents for nine years, they decided to try daytime swordfishing in the Keys. But the success of that initial outing may be hard to top: The 757.8 pound swordfish they caught off Islamorada appears to best Florida’s official champion by more than 140 pounds.

According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the biggest Florida swordfish was a 612-pound, 12-ounce specimen caught near Key Largo

With help from Capt. Nick Stanczyk, left, Debbie and Bill Lussier landed this ""Jurassic swordfish"" after an 8-plus-hour fight (Photo: Special to The News-Press)

They’d booked a charter with Capt. Nick Stanczyk and cruised toward the Gulf stream in about 1,600 feet of water, Lussier said. When one of the baited lines was about 100 yards from the boat, Lussier heard Stanczyk say, “The buoy!” Then, “It’s big!”

Bill started reeling. And reeling. It took two more hours for the fish to come into view, as the stalwart Bill kept cranking, fortified by the roast beef sandwiches Debbie fed him.

“Each time Bill got the leader to the reel, the fish would run – and I mean run,” she said. “At one point, I felt like we were on a whirl ride at the circus,” Lussier said.

After more than eight hours, the fish got too close to the boat. Mate Ross harpooned her in the backbone.

In case you missed it:

“After two darts and three gaffs into this Jurassic fish, Captain Nick was able to get the tail rope on and the fight was over.” Lussier said. Back at the dock at Bud ‘N Mary’s Marina in Islamorada, the fish measured 111 inches from lower jaw to tail fork, with a previously snapped bill that added another 40 inches, Lussier said. “It makes you think … What was down there that threatened her to the point that she stabbed it with her sword and broke it?”

The Lussiers have the sword as well as a fiberglass replica of the tail. As for all of the meat, “There were probably 100 or 150 people at the dock when we came in so we gave a lot of it away right then,” she said. They froze the rest and are working their way through it. “It’s excellent,” Lussier said, “absolutely excellent.”

250,"On Mother's Day, Daily News reporter Alexi Cardona reflects on her grandma's love","A few days before my paternal grandma passed away, she gave me a silver necklace with a marcasite butterfly pendant.

The day after we buried her, a butterfly came to the backyard of my family home in Hialeah. It fluttered near the areca palm trees lining the fence, then circled around and flew right over my head before disappearing into the níspero tree in my neighbors’ yard.

I like to believe that was her.

Abuela had been sick for some time, but it was still difficult to lose her. She had been in kidney failure, her lungs filling up with fluid.

Blanca Cardona and her granddaugher, Alexi Cardona. (Photo: Handout)

My mom sent me a text the morning of March 20 that said my abuela was in serious respiratory distress. Her hospice nurse started giving her morphine.

I worried, or maybe I hoped, that March 20 was a false alarm. We'd had a few of those. I packed a bag in case of an emergency trip to Miami anyway and went to work.

I didn't understand what the morphine doses meant at first. My mom told me later in the day it meant the beginning of the end, that my grandmother would likely only be alive a few more days. Abuela didn’t want any more hospital stays or calls to 911. She wanted to die at home when the time came.

Then I thought about how I would feel if things took a turn and she died without my being able to see her alive for the last time. My boss let me go home.

I'm grateful I had the opportunity to spend the five days before my grandma's death with her and my family. Fingers twined, we watched news, telenovelas, a Spanish-language version of ""The Voice"" and obstacle course shows.

My grandma was afraid to sleep alone the last few nights before she died. My aunt and dad alternated staying with her, and I slept next to her the Friday before she passed. I told her it would be like the sleepovers she and I used to have when I was a girl, but we both knew it wasn't.

Abuela held my hand and pet my hair during her fitful sleep. The oxygen concentrator gave her a steady stream of air. I stayed up all night afraid of her taking her last breath next to me.

The morning of March 25, my dad sounded the alarm to everyone that abuela wasn’t doing well. He had spent the previous night with her, and she wasn’t particularly responsive when she woke up. Her breathing was harsh.

She died holding my grandpa’s hand. She was surrounded by family, and a Catholic priest read her last rites as she took her last breath. Despite all the traffic laws I broke that morning, I got to her house a few minutes too late to say goodbye. I’m still trying not to be devastated about that.

I hope she felt our love, especially during those last few days. She gave us her love in abundance.

If I believe in God, I have to believe she is OK and in a better place.

My grandma, Blanca Rosa Cardona, was born in Camajuaní in the Villa Clara province of central Cuba in June 1938. She was the youngest of four sisters and the daughter of a farmer.

Blanca Cardona with (from left) her grandson, son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter. (Photo: Handout)

She married my grandfather, Vicente Alberto Cardona Sr., in 1957. They had three children — my uncle Juan Vicente Cardona, dad Vicente Alberto Cardona Jr. and aunt Beatriz Rosalia Acevedo.

The five of them left the island in July 1971 under the Freedom Flights program, los vuelos de la libertad, a period of unusual Cuban and American government cooperation to manage the migration of Cubans to Miami.

By then, the Castro regime had seized the family’s livestock and would later seize their country house and farm.

Abuela and her family settled in Miami for good. They lived just southwest of Little Havana for some time before moving to the Coral Terrace neighborhood near West Miami.

Abuela is survived by my abuelo, two of her sisters, her children, three grandchildren and countless cousins, nieces, great-nieces, great-nephews and godchildren.

She worked for and retired from the U.S. Postal Service. Family lore has it that she worked so much overtime, she was able to pay off the mortgage on their house in a few years’ time.

I realize I don’t know much about my grandmother beyond who she was to me and my family. I regret not knowing about her upbringing and early life, what her hobbies were before she got married and had kids, what her aspirations and fears were. Whether she ever would have left her country if not for the communist regime that took over and took everything. I wish I’d had the forethought to do an oral history with her.

What I do know, though, is my abuela was the type of person to open her home to any family member who needed it. She took pride in her home, inside and out. She kept a clean, beautiful house and cooked good food despite her long overnight hours at work.

She didn’t allow sick or injured family members to be alone at home or in hospitals. When my mom was put on bedrest during her pregnancy with me, my grandmother cooked almost every day and visited my mom while my dad worked. She had a generous spirit and was meticulous in her giving.

CLOSE Mother's Day is coming up this Sunday, so now's your chance to brush up on your Mother's Day trivia with these 10 facts. 10Best Editors, USA TODAY 10Best

When my little brother Alejandro and I were kids, she gave us the best Easter Sunday of our lives. She covered every inch of her front lawn with plastic eggs filled with candy, dollar bills and coins. When we thought we were done, she turned our attention to the hedges that surrounded the front of her house. There were hundreds more eggs hidden.

My abuela showered us with love at every opportunity.

When I was in elementary school, my dad used to wake up for work way before dawn. He’d pack me and my little brother into his white pickup and take us to our grandparents’ house so I could get a couple of extra hours of sleep before school. Abuela would wake me up every weekday morning and let me sleep for 5 more minutes in her lap on the living room recliner. She’d then sit me at the kitchen counter and make my favorite breakfast — Keebler crackers with margarine and warm chocolate milk — before driving me to school and walking me to the entrance.

My abuela used to sew clothes in funky-patterned fabrics for me — sunflowers, sea creatures, fruits, polka dots and stripes. They were the only things I wanted to wear.

My summers in elementary and middle school were spent at abuelo and abuela’s house watching cartoons, playing board games and coloring. She’d sit side-by-side with me as we filled pages and pages of coloring books. She had a sense of color I've never had. Abuela rode out Hurricane Irma with my family at my parents’ house. When the power went out, we colored by lantern light.

Abuela played piano from a young age in Cuba and kept playing until she was too sick and her hands trembled too much to play. We could sometimes hear her music from the driveway when we went to visit.

My aunt and I made a memory board for the funeral. We covered a poster board with pictures of my grandma’s early life and her growing family through the years. You could see the changes over time.

Abuela used to be all big, pink cheeks, big glasses and big smiles. But she wasn’t the abuela I knew for about the past 12 years. Mental illness stole her smile and dimmed some of her light. We saw glimpses of her old self in her more manic periods. We completely lost her in her depressive periods.

One of the last full-length, clear conversations she and I had was about a year ago. We talked about our lifelong struggles with weight. I don’t remember what I told her, but she said in Spanish: “Even big girls are beautiful. Even big girls deserve love.” She made me believe that about myself.

I love my abuela because she did everything with purpose and wanted the people in her life to feel special. I love her because she had so much capacity for love and selflessness.

If there is one thing I have learned since her death, it’s to talk to the people you love about their lives. Listen to them. Learn their stories. Ask them how the good times and bad times in their lives made them who they are. Think about how the people you love have shaped you.

My maternal grandmother, Eladia Inocencia Olea Cuesta, taught me how to hold a fork and knife and properly cut food. She taught me etiquette and instilled the lesson of saying please and thank you to everyone for everything. She taught my mom how to be strong, loyal, independent and fierce, all lessons my mom passed on to me and my brother. Abuelita Eladia, or Alla as we called her, even gave us our favorite saying: Canta para que tu mal espanta. Sing to scare your troubles away. She died about 17 years ago.

My paternal grandmother taught me how to be generous, kind, gracious and creative. Even when she was unwell, she was giving. When moved away from home to work at the paper, abuela packed up a box full of household items and knicknacks — a dish sponge, espresso cups, a first aid kit, sewing scissors, placemats, linens, a terracotta angel statue — and had my parents deliver it to me when I moved into my apartment. Little reminders of her are everywhere.

If you have lost a loved one, whether days, months or years ago, and still grieve, I’m with you.

Abuelas are something special. I was lucky to have mine for as long as I did. And I was tremendously fortunate mine were exceptional.

To understand where Godby’s baseball team is now – District 2-5A champions – you have to understand where they were.

On April 5 of last year, first-year Godby head coach Tonayne Brown, an alum of the program under current Leon coach Robbie Zimmerman, was watching his team get shellacked by Maclay on its own field during its 16th game.

When the third inning ended with the Cougars down 17-1, his players proceeded to file out of their dugout, heads hung, ready to receive a postgame handshake.

But the game wasn’t over.

The mercy rule wasn’t in effect until after four innings, but the Cougars had become so accustomed to losing by huge margins during their 0-10 start that they didn’t think twice.

For a team with just four players with actual baseball experience, it was a sign of Brown’s struggle in taking over a program that won a state title in 2001 under Zimmerman.

In the first week of the season alone, Godby was no-hit three times.

“It was difficult,” Brown said. “We were trying to teach fundamentals, going over things they should know already. It was trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole.”

After the embarrassing moment against the Marauders, Brown could be heard saying with agitation, “The game’s not over! Do not disrespect the game that I love!” After the exchange, a senior came up to him and apologized for not leading the team.

“It was really about playing the game the way they were being taught,” Brown said. “When you don’t hustle, you get beat 21-0. If you put up a fight, it tells me you’re doing all you can to win the game. If you think you’re beat from the beginning and don’t care, it hurts me.

“Back in my day, we had to fight for everything we got. The whole area was good at baseball. If you didn’t come ready to play, you got beat bad.”

Then something happened – Godby rallied in the fourth inning.

After scoring just 14 runs total during a 1-14 start, Godby scored 11 runs in the inning. The game was suddenly far from over. The Cougars were experiencing momentum for the first time. The reversal from negative to positive energy was immediate and contagious.

Though the Cougars ultimately lost the game 19-13, it was a turning point. Godby closed its season 4-3, including a three-game win streak that boasted a win over a 21-5 Sneads team.

Godby’s season concluded with a 10-0 loss to Marianna in a district semifinal.

“Some fell into an attitude of ‘It’s Godby High School, we’re not supposed to win,’” Brown said. “I’m trying to get them a different mentality. I tell stories all the time about the teams that have come before them, and now they’re starting to put it together.”

Now is a relative term for this season. Why? Because Godby started the 2019 season 0-9. And if there wasn’t a forfeit win over Gadsden County after that, the winless streak would have stretched to 15 games.

Same thing as last year?

“It was different,” Brown said. “We got off to a slow start. We didn’t even have a full practice until the day before our first game because Hurricane Michael knocked our fences down and there was construction on the baseball field.”

Despite a challenging schedule that included playing Leon, Lincoln, Chiles, Class 1A No. 1 Panama City Bozeman, and district opponents Rickards and Marianna, the Cougars showed their progress from one year to next in the run department.

Two of the losses – including to Marianna – were by one run. Godby put up eight runs against Bozeman.

“I set the schedule up tough because if we could compete with the big schools – just compete – we should do real well in our own district,” Brown said. “That’s my goal every year, to play Leon, Lincoln, and Chiles because they set the bar. They’ll be good every year.

“If you can just hold on and play five good innings, that’s what I ask. Just fight. Then when we get to district it starts to click. They’re the same caliber as we are, and we know we can compete.”

Heading into this past week’s district tournament, Godby’s lone wins were against Gadsden County, FAMU DRS and Munroe. The Cougars had lost two games to Rickards by an average of 12.5 runs.

Playing in Marianna against the Raiders, Godby surprised the team that last year made the regional final and won 20 games. The Cougars scored seven runs in the second inning, and broke a 9-9 tie in the sixth inning with three runs over the final two innings. They picked up a 12-9 win by playing a lot like Rickards always played while building its program – using its speed to do damage.

Godby bunted, stole bases, and took advantage of every opportunity to move its runners around the bases. Junior Alvin Jones had four of the Cougars’ nine steals. Senior Colby DeLong drove in three runs via two doubles.

“It was the gameplan, but it was something I hadn’t done all year,” Brown said. “We needed to get their defensive players moving and get into their pitchers’ heads. Once you get someone rattled, they’ll throw balls, and then, boom, base hit and you score runs.”

Unlike when leadership was lacking last year, before this year’s district tournament a couple Godby seniors and juniors called a team meeting to let everyone know what their expectations were.

Brown was pleased because it was no longer just his voice bellowing instructions. The players had the sense of urgency required to pull off a shocking win.

“They knew if we played the way we were capable of playing, a lot of (regular-season) games would have turned out different,” Brown said. “They used it as motivation. A lot of people didn’t expect them to be there. They wrote us off. They took offense to it and played their hearts out. They wanted to show that we do deserve to be here, that we’ve put in the work just like everyone else.”

The victory not only sent the Cougars to the championship game, it got them in the regional playoffs.

Playing Marianna on Thursday for a district title, lo and behold, Godby did it again, winning a 5-4 game to capture an improbable district title.

“It’s awesome,” Brown said. “It’s something we had seen in the players already, but they just had to see it themselves. When we step on the field, we’re by far the most dangerous team because of our speed. Now, they’re learning to utilize it.”

Hesitation early in the year has turned into instinctual alertness. Passed balls are free bases, instead of runners getting caught stealing because they reacted slowly.

Struggles around the fifth inning and later – “the wheels would fall off and one error would compound into more errors,” said Brown – dissipated.

“This time, when we got punched in the mouth, they settled down and made plays,” Brown added. “They composed themselves and got outs.”

Godby received a huge, complete-game pitching effort from Jones, a first-team All-Big Bend football player last fall. He allowed just four hits.

It started with Marianna putting runners on first and second with one out in the first inning, but Jones produced a double play that started on a pick-off. What resulted was a 1-4-6-5-2-1 double play, cutting down both base runners attempting a double steal.

“The confidence took over after that play,” said Brown, who watched Micha Mitchell and Landon Gardner both drive in two runs.

As district champ, Godby (6-21) will host South Walton (17-9) in a Region 1-5A quarterfinal next Tuesday. The Cougars have all the confidence they can be victorious.

By record, they’re the underdog but probably shouldn’t be doubted anymore.

“I have total faith we can win,” Brown said. “They’re riding on cloud nine and are in a place where they know they can compete. They guessed they could after the Rickards game. After beating Marianna, now they know.

“It’s a different attitude and mentality. They’re ready to play.”

254,Triumph members urge county caution on golf course,"Count current Triumph Gulf Coast board member and former Florida Speaker of the House Allan Bense as no fan of Gulf County pursuing the purchase of a golf course.

His fellow Triumph board member Lewis Bear, Jr. has had some words of caution.

The board of Triumph Gulf Coast met last week and approved more than $5 million in grants to Gulf County.

The largest grant, for $4.27 million, came from a Triumph fund established to help the four counties most-impacted by Hurricane Michael with potential property tax losses.

In the final language of the grant proposal, the Triumph board included language that expressly barred the county from using any grant funds in the proposed purchase of a golf course.

And the board did so after some pointed criticism from Bense and later Bear.

Initially the Triumph board approved funding only 50 percent of any ad valorem or property tax shortfalls, but officials from Wakulla and Franklin counties would not be applying for hurricane relief funds from Triumph.

So, at last week’s meeting the Triumph board approved disbursing the remaining relief fund dollars to Gulf and Bay counties on a pro-rated basis based the original grant amounts.

Jason Shoaf, Gulf County’s representative on the Triumph board, asked when estimates of tax shortfalls would be certified and was informed they would be by July 1.

Assistant County Administrator Warren Yeager was asked to the podium to discuss how the county would disburse the additional dollars, Yeager noting the original application was for 50 percent so the additional funds would bring local governments closer to “being whole” from Hurricane Michael tax impacts.

Bense quickly turned the discussion to reports of the Board of County Commissioners pursuing the purchase of St. Joseph Bay Golf Club.

“I’m not sure what possessed them to do that,” Bense said.

At its last regular monthly meeting the last week of April, the BOCC heard from Administrator Michael Hammond on the proposed purchase.

Hammond said county staff “have been in negotiations” with the country club and urged board support to “conclude” the deal while providing an outline of the deal.

That outline included a purchase price of the club’s current debt or $390,000, whichever number was lower, that would include all equipment, grounds, the restaurant and meeting room.

The county would hire an operator but would subsidize operations for three years at up to $100,000 per year.

Bense said half-a-dozen Bay County golf courses had recently closed and he had recently passed on being paid to assume ownership of another course.

And there was a very good reason for both.

“They (golf courses) don’t make money,” Bense said, adding that the course which he owns, Holiday Golf Club, makes money only because of the 25,000 rental units and condos within a short distance.

Bear said he was an officer at Escambia County country club for years and every year membership had to be assessed additional fees to meet maintenance needs.

In addition, Bear said he had “lost a couple of million (dollars)” as an owner or investor in golf courses.

“Tell me the Board of County Commissioners is not getting into that business,” Bense asked of Yeager. “I hope you are looking at the numbers.”

And, he added, the county receiving Triumph grant funding for property tax shortfalls while pursuing the purchase of a golf course did not “look real smart” and the “optics are not positive.”

Yeager emphasized the county did not have “ad valorem” dollars for such a purchase and was only contemplating the buy because the county had been approached by the club’s membership.

The county hoped to support tourism by purchasing the club and had a fifth-cent of bed tax generating to apply to the purchase.

“No matter what, ad valorem taxes dollars will not go into that (purchase),” Yeager said.

Given that, Yeager was asked if the county would be okay with the Triumph board ensuring the funds were not used on the golf course in language for the motion approving the grant.

“Absolutely, our board would not have an issue with that,” Yeager said.

Yeager characterized the county as “early in negotiations” with the golf club leadership on the purchase price as well as exploring whether the purchase was a legal use of bed taxes.

Fifth-penny dollars were already set aside for a project at the 10th Street ball parks, but Yeager said that project was now stalled.

Bense said the fifth-penny and property taxes were part of a similar coin to most people.

“Fifth-penny, ad valorem, to the working man that’s taxes,” Bense said. “I sure would caution you about a golf course.”",https://www.starfl.com/news/20190509/triumph-members-urge-county-caution-on-golf-course?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T23:37:40Z,"The Star, Port St. Joe",Couple,"101 W Hwy 98, Port St Joe, FL 32456, USA",FL,32456
256,Everglades City senior ready to take the next step with the U.S. Marine Corps,"Editor’s note: This is one in a series of Naples Daily News stories on Graduates of Distinction, who are selected by staff at the high school.

Last year, Claybrook ""Clay"" Story drove to the nearest U.S. Marine Corps recruitment center without telling anyone where he was going.

""I just Googled the closest recruitment center,"" said Story, 18, who will graduate from Everglades City School this month. ""After I got out (of his recruitment meeting) it was kind of like, 'Oh wow, I did that.'""

He enlisted that day. He's ready to leave Everglades City. Story said he doesn't want to look back.

""This was something new,"" Story said.

Everglades City School's pride in Story and his choice to join the Marine Corps are two reasons the school selected him as its 2019 Graduate of Distinction.

""Claybrook Story has had to overcome some challenges but has been a very good student. He was successful in dual-enrollment classes so college was an option, but he is taking a different path,"" Everglades City School principal James Ragusa wrote in an email to the Daily News. ""We are very proud of Claybrook. He is a great representative of EVG (Everglades).""

Story will head to boot camp at Parris Island in August before joining the Marines' ranks.

""I've always been really dependent on myself,"" Story said. ""Getting out of high school and joining the Marine Corps, that's a really big step for me.""

His nervous energy is mixed with excitement, he said.

In case you missed it: Congrats! Here are all of the 2019 Graduates of Distinction

""Probably, the hardest part for everyone has got to be boot camp,"" Story said. ""I'm always just kind of worried that I'll never be quite at the level of physical fitness that I need to be before boot camp, so I'm training to get to that level.""

Story considered college but knew he needed to take another path. He never loved daily academics.

""I needed to find a different path for me,"" Story said. ""It seems like a lot more trouble than it's worth.""

Story makes light of his struggles but said a lot of them helped him reach his full potential.

""Growing up, my life was a little messier in the beginning,"" Story said. ""Drugs run rampant down here. It's hard watching people go through something like that.""

He said drug use by his family and friends made him cling to his plans. He saw the detrimental effects firsthand.

For most of his life, his mother cared for him, but Story started living with his aunt when he turned 11 years old.

The oldest of four siblings and two step-siblings, Story tried his best to help out and take care of them.

""It (being an older brother) got me on a set path,"" Story said.

His family is supportive, but scared for him, he said. The same goes for his friends.

""I've been with my class since Pre-K,"" Story said. ""We basically grew up kind of a big family. We know everyone's families, their dogs, their cats, we know everything about them. I'd say they're my friends, but they are also part of my family too.""

""Most of them are happy for me,"" Story said. ""A couple of them are scared.""

Story hopes to reach the rank of staff sergeant before he ends his career with the Marines. After the Marines, he plans to enter private security. He has thought about his every move in the next decade.

Story never really thought of any other avenue. Once he decided to join, he only thought of the Marines.

""The Marine Corps seemed like my best pathway,"" Story said. ""When I think of the best of the best, I think Marine Corps.""

257,Lakeland police look for person who spray-painted 16 buildings,"- Lakeland police are looking for the person who spray-painted graffiti throughout a busy street. They believe at least 16 businesses were hit within a two-hour period.

Saturday night, between 9 and 11, police say a man walked north for two miles on South Florida Avenue, spray painting the word ""SOLOE"" and some profanities along the way.

Debra Haskell, owner of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Olive Branch said her sign was sprayed on both sides.

""Of course my heart sank,"" Haskell said. ""It's very disheartening as an independent business owner. We put our heart and our soul into our businesses.""

""I'm working probably 12 hours a day, 6 days a week to make my business go,"" Haskell said, ""and, somebody comes in without regard or thought to the businesses or what we do for the community.""

Continue reading below

It appears the tagger was working solo. Otherwise, his lookout might've advised him not to spray the very well-surveilled downtown bus terminal. Police hope someone recognizes him from the video.

Fortunately, Haskell was able to get the paint cleaned off. But for other small businesses, it can be a pricey fix.

""The businesses around here generally, we have a $5,000-10,000 deductible on our insurance,"" Haskell said. ""It would have been a couple thousand dollars if I had to replace those signs.""

Sean Lee, who rides the bus through Lakeland daily, enjoys the mix of historic charm and modern vibe within the city. He's disappointed that someone would try to ruin it.

""I feel very upset about it,"" Lee said. ""It's not a good thing to do, especially, with the beautification of Lakeland you know? I hope they catch the person who did this to make him pay for what he's done.""

Those who live in, or just love visiting Lakeland can't understand how anyone could do something so low.

""I hope whatever is going in that person's life, they do find help and they do find peace in their life,"" Haskell said. ""It's just unfortunate that they have such angst the local businesses.""

Police say the suspect appears to be a white male wearing a camouflage jacket with the words Levi’s printed on the sleeve and red tennis shoe. Please take a look at the photographs and if you know the identity of the suspect, call Detective David Sharrett at 863-834-8967.

258,"Softball regional roundup: Estero wins; Mariner, North Fort Myers slated for rematch","CLOSE Mariner senior Hannah Holloway struck out 15, and Dee Bent homered as the Tritons edged Immokalee in Class 6A regional quarterfinals Naples Daily News

Class 7A

Estero 6, Charlotte 1

The Estero softball team had to wait out a long lightning delay before Wednesday’s Class 7A regional quarterfinal. Once the Wildcats got on the field – at 9:11 p.m. following a wait of 2 hours and 11 minutes – they took care of business.

Estero had two big innings at the plate and near-untouchable pitching all night in a 6-1 win over Charlotte at home. After winning a third straight district title last week, the Wildcats (27-2) advance to the regional semifinals for the third year in a row.

The game was tied 1-1 after the second inning. Estero took the lead with two runs in the fourth thanks to RBIs from Caly Hoard and Tyler Olive.

The Wildcats broke the game open on Chelsea Dumas’ bases-loaded double in the fifth inning. The second double of the game for Dumas scored three runs to give Estero a 6-1 lead.

“We were close at the beginning,” Dumas said. “Then we started making adjustments, putting balls on the bat, getting on (base). We just took it from there.”

Starter Lauren Hobbs and reliever Alex Salter held Charlotte to one hit. Hobbs struck out six in four innings. Salter threw a perfect final three innings for Estero.

Class 6A

Mariner 2, Immokalee 1

Senior Hannah Holloway delivered a big-time performance for the Tritons, striking out 15 and walking none as the Tritons edged the Indians.

Mariner (20-8) now gets a coveted rematch at North Fort Myers in the regional semifinals Tuesday. North rallied to beat Mariner 6-4 in nine innings last week for the district title.

Immokalee was making its first appearance in the regional playoffs since the Indians began playing fastpitch softball in 1993. And at times early in the game, the Indians seemed a bit tense.

The Tritons scored a run in the top of the first when Dee Bent came home on a passed ball, but freshman Ava Nunez was able to limit the damage and strand the bases loaded. Bent later blasted a leadoff solo homer in the third, but Nunez settled down and relied on some outstanding defense behind her to keep the game close.

“It was really important (scoring early) to set the tone and the moment,” Mariner coach Rachel Holloway said. “We got the momentum first, so it really helped us.”

The coach remains impressed with the efforts of her younger sister, who has been coming through in big spots since arriving as a freshman in 2016.

“Four years, heart and soul, we couldn’t ask for anything better,” Rachel Holloway said. “She knew in the sixth inning when the heart of their lineup was coming up, she really dug down. She’s been great.”

Mia Gallegos went 2 for 3 in her final game for Immokalee (17-7), ripping a leadoff double in the fourth and scoring from second on a passed ball. She led off the sixth with a single and was bunted to second by Nunez, but Holloway fanned Sommer Erebia and Ariel Garcia to end the threat. Mariner right fielder Erinn Pratt made two running catches in the seventh to keep the Indians from threatening, and Holloway finished with a strikeout of Araceli Anzualda.

Immokalee coach Ruben Lucio said he was proud of the way his team played, and applauded the efforts of graduating seniors Jillian Rodriguez, Gallegos and Erebia.

“You’re talking about players that hit first, third and fifth in the lineup for us,” Lucio said. “Sommer led the county in RBIs. They’re great softball players but more than anything, but as people, they’re as good as it gets.”

North Fort Myers 14, Lely 4

A first-inning deficit, albeit brief, did not affect the North Fort Myers softball team.

It didn't affect the Red Knights in the third inning, either.

North Fort Myers (19-10) punched their ticket to the regional semifinal in dominant fashion, thanks to a lineup where all nine batters reached base, with eight of them contributing at least one run batted in.

The Red Knights were down twice early, once in the first inning and then in the third inning, right after a lightning delay that lasted for just over an hour. They weren't fazed either time, putting up three runs in the first inning and then scoring nine in the third.

""We hit the ball well tonight,"" North Fort Myers coach Jeff Miner said. ""Our last two games, we've been behind and came back. That's key for us, because it allows the kids to not panic being down a couple of runs.""

""I tip my hat to Lely. They played hard with 10 players.""

Emma Johnson started on the mound, going four innings and allowing only four hits, one earned run, and ended up striking out seven. Sarah Morris went 2-for-2 with two walks and two RBIs for North Fort Myers. Lely's Olivia Hamilton and Sara Leon went a combined 4-for-4 with a triple, two walks, and an RBI for the Trojans (8-14).

Miner felt like there was a lack of desire in his dugout coming out of the rain delay.

""We've got to play with more energy,"" Miner added. ""We have to have more zest for wanting to play this game. I just want to see more energy out of the girls.""

The regional semifinal rematch between Mariner and North Fort Myers is expected to be a hotly contested one. The Red Knights have taken the last two meetings this season, including the district title game, where North came back down 3-0 and pulled off the shocker in nine innings, 6-4. Mariner took the first meeting by a score of 1-0.

259,Hurricane Michael survivors and Trump supporters flock to Panama City rally,"As Marine One descended over the Aaron Bessant Park Amphitheater in Panama City Beach at around 6 p.m. Wednesday, the crowd of red hats below collectively erupted in cheers and screams.

Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez was at the podium on stage as the chopper disappeared behind an adjacent wooded area. She paused her speech and drew the crowd’s attention to the helicopter.

""I think someone is here,"" she said, which drew even more cheers from the audience.

That ""someone"" was President Donald J. Trump, who hosted his first Florida campaign rally for the 2020 race at the Panama City Beach event space next to the Pier Park shopping center. It was his first time visiting the Florida Panhandle since he flew down several days after Hurricane Michael in mid-October.

Hurricane Michael response: Trump praises first responders, Gov. Scott for Hurricane Michael response

""Things are going well, OK, well,” Trump said within five minutes of taking the stage at the rally. ""You got hit with a little hurricane called Michael. That was not a nice hurricane, I can tell you that, but it’s going well.""

Hurricane Michael slammed into the eastern Panhandle on Oct. 10, causing an estimated $53 billion in damage and leading to more than 40 deaths and near-total loss of infrastructure in some areas. Trump told the crowd he saw the ""devastation"" the hurricane wrought when he visited Tyndall Air Force Base earlier in the day.

In his speech, Trump promised additional hurricane relief funding for the Panhandle — ""no games, no gimmicks, no delays"" — and talked about the ""incredible"" work of volunteers in the aftermath of the hurricane and the ""unbreakable spirit"" of Panhandle residents.

Hurricane Michael survivors turn out for Trump

Many of those Panhandle residents were in the crowd Wednesday night, voicing their unequivocal support for the president, praising his work for Northwest Florida and saying they hoped he would bring more federal aid to the area.

Bruce Schramm, a Panama City resident, said he and his family lost everything in the monster Category 5 storm and have struggled to navigate the Federal Emergency Management Administration’s response. He was one of the first people in line to get into Trump’s rally after camping out overnight for the event.

Schramm said he was hopeful Trump’s visit would prompt congressional action on emergency relief funding, which has been tied up in a stalemate in Congress.

""If he sees it (the devastation), maybe he can bring it up to Congress,"" Schramm said. ""We’ve got a lot of locals here showing up tonight, and maybe they can get with him and something can finally get done.""

Florida hasn't received any supplemental disaster funding for Hurricane Michael from the federal government since the storm made landfall nearly seven months ago, as politicians in Washington argue over negotiations associated with the payouts.

Nick and Stormy Foerfler, who are also Panama City residents, were among the first in line to see the president. They said they didn’t fault Trump for the lack of federal funding, and said his visit to Panama City in the days after Hurricane Michael helped restore power to the area.

""We would like to see some funding here, but we know it’s not all Trump,"" Nick Foerfler said. ""It takes all of them coming to an agreement, but it’s not that easy.""

Tyndall AFB tour: Before Trump Panama City Beach rally, he'll tour Hurricane Michael damage at Tyndall AFB

Inside the rally, fellow Panama City resident David Shearon donned red, white and blue Trump socks, a Trump 2020 campaign hat and a red ""Make America Great Again"" shirt. He said he lost his job as a physical therapist after Hurricane Michael when many elderly Bay County residents relocated due to a lack of basic care services. He is now trying to make it as a Realtor.

Shearon unequivocally supported Trump, saying his message was ""inspiring.""

""Hurricane Michael destroyed our town,"" Shearon said. ""I lost my job for seven months, and that’s the reason he’s coming today. He’s going to announce that he’s helping us.""

At the rally, Trump announced — to great fanfare — that the federal government would cover 90 percent of the recovery costs associated with Michael cleanup.

Trump supporters 'come here for the energy'

Neil Rupp, who was wearing an Ohio State Buckeyes shirt, made sure to snap a thumbs-up photo with a Trump backdrop just before the rally began.

He and his wife live in Ohio, but were in the area on vacation and decided to go to the rally.

""We both like President Trump’s philosophy, and we want to see the swamp drained and it’s going to take another four years, for sure,"" Rupp said. ""I’m a veteran, and he believes in veterans, and he wants to keep our country safe.""

More out-of-towners included a group of five young men from Enterprise, Alabama, who were shirtless and had letters spelling out ""TRUMP"" painted on their stomachs.

""We’re showing our support for Trump. It’s nothing to be ashamed about,"" said D.J. Burcham, who had the ""R"" painted on him. ""Everything America has lost over the years and years of bad decisions, he’s bringing back.""

Margaret and Rod Sprinkle, who live in Pensacola, wore matching red shirts and blue jeans, cowboy boots and American flag bandannas. Margaret Sprinkle had a yellow button on her shirt with Trump’s face on it and the words ""Let’s Do It Again!"" underneath.

The couple said they attended Trump’s November rally in Pensacola and wanted to make the two-hour drive to Panama City Beach to see the president again.

""Anywhere that Trump goes where we can get to, we’ll go,"" Margaret Sprinkle said. ""If he goes to Kansas, we’ll go back there. We come here for the energy and the positives.""

""I hope he does bring more help to this area down here,"" she added. ""Locals take care of locals.""

Seven months after Michael, not much has changed

Ahead of the rally Wednesday, the Panama City area was abuzz with the excitement of the presidential visit.

Along U.S. 98 near the event venue, Panama City resident Bret Henderson placed hundreds of signs along either side of the highway emblazoned with the words ""Pres. Trump Help Tyndall Now."" Henderson, who is on the Military Affairs Committee with the Bay County Chamber of Commerce, said he was hoping the president would take note of the struggling Air Force base, which was decimated by Hurricane Michael.

""Our community relies on Tyndall Air Force Base more than anything in this area,"" he said. ""So, it’s important that (Trump) knows that this is the most critical piece that is being overlooked in their lack of funding.""

In Mexico Beach, which was among the areas most hardest hit by the hurricane, resident Diane Pugh was living in a FEMA trailer in the front yard of where her home was once. She said she wished she could attend Wednesday night’s rally to show her support for the president, but life since Michael has been ""hectic"" and she can’t get away.

""Day to day, it’s just been terrible,"" she said. ""I really hope President Trump can do something about it.""

In the eastern part of the Panama City, which was hit the hardest by the storm, small business owners Jamie and Jennifer Burton were busy inside their billiards bar, Pockets, trying to get it ready to reopen for business. They were just getting ready for their grand opening in October when the hurricane hit.



After the storm, Jamie Burton spray painted ""Uncle Trump"" and ""Help Us – Trump"" on the outside of his business. He said he was trying to send a message to the president, who he and his wife both support, that the area was in need of help in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Michael.

Seven months later, not much has changed.

""Everybody around here has a survival story,"" Jamie Burton said. ""After the storm, Trump did his job. He helped us. We still need his help.""

262,Tampa woman resorts to theft to get help for heroin addiction in jail,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

LARGO, Fla. (WFLA) - A Tampa woman told police she resorted to stealing from a Largo CVS and asked to go to jail because she is ""addicted to heroin and cannot get help anywhere else.""

A arrest report shows that on May 5, Michelle Hildebrandt, 32, walked into the CVS Pharmacy at 2390 East Bay Dr. and ripped open various food items, dumping them out on the floor. When Largo police officers arrived, Hildebrandt asked them to take her to jail.

The report goes on to say Hildebrandt made spontaneous statements admitting to her actions and said she wanted to go to jail due to her addiction.

Even though Hildebrandt lives in Tampa, her father, Mike Morris, told News Channel 8 his daughter specifically went to Pinellas County to commit her crime because she heard that particular jail was better for addicts behind bars.

A former addict now clean for 25 years, Morris said he didn't mind that his daughter broke the law in order to get clean.

""She knew she needed to be some place where she couldn't just leave,"" he said. ""I'm proud of her for having gone to those lengths to try and get help.""

He explained his daughter started using heroin about two years ago after getting hooked on pills a couple years before that. Morris added that it took Hildebrandt three shoplifting attempts on Sunday to even get caught, going to two stores prior to CVS.

He also explained his daughter has tried to get help before but gave up when the withdrawals got too bad. She also doesn't have the money or insurance to cover entering a rehab facility.

For the sake of his 5-year-old granddaughter, Morris hopes his daughter's most recent act of desperation is enough to get her clean.

""There's literally millions of people out there right now that need help, and want help, but they can't get it because they don't have any money,"" he said.

Hildebrandt has priors on her record including theft and prostitution. Morris said his daughter resorted to prostitution to pay for her addiction.",https://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/tampa-woman-resorts-to-largo-theft-to-get-help-for-heroin-addiction-in-jail/1987619832,2019-05-08T13:28:17Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

266,Emergency hearing scheduled today for Hillsborough toddler at center of medical custody battle,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

TAMPA, Fla. - TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - An emergency hearing has been scheduled for 8 a.m. Tuesday morning regarding a Hillsborough toddler at the center of a medical custody battle.

Noah McAdams is currently battling leukemia.

However, his parents do not want him to undergo traditional chemotherapy treatment.

Instead, they want his cancer treated with a more organic approach, one that includes medical-grade cannabis.

Noah has already received two chemo treatments at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, according to family members.

The child's parents, Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball, are now taking their fight to court, hoping the state will allow them to treat their son's cancer using homeopathic methods, not chemotherapy.

The family maintains that's what they were doing when they left Hillsborough County last Monday with their 3-year-old son, sparking a multi-state search. The parents claim they were seeking a second opnion, searching for an alternative to chemo.

The family was eventually found safe in Kentucky.

Authorities put out urgent alerts for Noah, saying the boy was in need of ""lifesaving medical care.""

Hillsborough County deputies said the parents failed to bring their son to a medically-necessary hospital procedure last week, then refused to follow up with additional lifesaving medical care.

""We just want of the therapies less drastic than chemotherapy,"" Noah's mother said.

The parents have temporarily lost custody of their son and the boy is with his grandparents.

""These parents are absolutely not looking to let their kid suffer, they're going to treat this child,"" said Michael Minardi, the attorney representing Noah's parents.

The couple tells News Channel 8 they absolutely do not want chemotherapy for their child, insisting that other treatments be considered.

""I want my son home and for him to be treated with a treatment that is not going to damage his little body so much,"" said Noah's mom.

The parents want to use medical cannabis, CBD oils, vitamins and a strict diet to treat Noah's cancer.

The couple tells us they're not opposed to treatment, they just want to do it differently.

""We want him to be treated with something that has less side effects,"" Noah's mother said. ""Chemotherapy is so brutal on a body.""

A judge will consider both sides of the case on Tuesday morning.

""The best outcome is that the judge says, 'nope. I'm not going to order any treatment. Let the parents do what they choose, as long as they are treating the child,'"" the family's attorney said.",https://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/emergency-hearing-scheduled-today-for-hillsborough-toddler-at-center-of-medical-custody-battle/1985508770,2019-05-07T08:21:03Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

Broward Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Joy Oglesby released a sketch of the suspect with a medium build on Monday afternoon. According to Detective Nicole Haugh, the victims described him as being about 28 to 40 years old, weighing from 145 to 160 pounds and standing about 5 feet, 6 inches tall.

Haugh and Oglesby are asking anyone with information about the April 29 carjacking to call 954-321-4253 or Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477. Callers with tips leading to an arrest in the case are eligible for a reward of up to $3,000.

TAMPA (WFLA) - A Hillsborough County couple at the center of a medical custody battle continued their fight outside Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital Saturday.

Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball rallied for their three-year-old son Noah who has leukemia. Earlier this week, they took the boy to Kentucky which sparked a search for them.

The couple avoided getting the boy chemotherapy because they claim it would be too tough on his body.

""I cannot believe how many people are rallying on social media and have rallied out here in the middle of the day in Florida. I mean its sweltering hot and they're out here with their kids and they believe in this movement,"" Bland-Ball said.

Right now the boy is in his grandmother's custody. The couple tells WFLA they're not opposed to treatment, they just want to do it differently.

269,Florida State fans excited as Willie Taggart's spring tour rolls through Tallahassee,"The Willie Taggart Booster tour made its annual stop in Tallahassee Friday, and the excitement level from fans was still very high.

More than 100 FSU fans came out to golf with Taggart at the Southwood Golf Club and be a part of the event put on by the Tallahassee Seminole Club.

""We’ve had pretty good enthusiasm this year,"" said Brian McMath, the former President of the Tallahassee Seminole Club and co-chair for the golf tournament.

""Last year we had a great turnout because everyone was really excited about coach Taggart coming in. It was nice, after the season last year, to see that we still had good enthusiasm for this year’s tournament.

""We almost sold the thing out completely. I think people after the spring game are excited to see the changes that were made and feel optimistic about where we’re going.""

Buy Photo Florida State fans wait to get started golfing during Willie Taggart's spring booster tour stop at the Southwood Golf Club. (Photo: Wayne McGahee III/Democrat)

Taggart's first year at FSU didn't go as planned.

The Seminoles are coming off their first losing season since 1976 and didn't make a bowl game for the first time since 1981.

Of course, FSU had to reschedule a game against Louisiana-Monroe and beat Southern Miss in the Independence Bowl to avoid those distinctions a year prior under former coach Jimbo Fisher.

""I have the utmost faith in coach Taggart,"" Tallahassee resident James Sumner said.

""I don’t think you can judge that the whole season on him. He did the best with what we had. I like where we’re going in recruiting. I’ve got faith in him. He’s got what it takes to get us where we need to be. Patience is a virtue.""

Fans weren't happy with the result at the end of the year no matter who was at fault and neither was Taggart.

He brought in three new coaches on the offensive side of the ball to help fix the issues, and filled some holes on the roster through the transfer portal.

""Everything looks like it’s going up,"" said Tyler Thimmes, President of the Tallahassee Seminole Club.

""Hopefully that is the case. As long as we’re making changes, and it looks like we’re making changes for the good, you can only be excited. At least it’s not the same thing. We are doing something different.""

More: Florida State fans can play for the Seminoles in new Madden NFL 20 feature

All three new coaches have brought some level of excitement to fans.

Offensive coordinator Kendal Briles took over playcalling duties from Taggart and brings a reputation of high-powered offenses to Tallahassee.

Wide receivers coach Ron Dugans is a former standout wide receiver at FSU that has produced NFL wide receivers everywhere he's been as a coach.

Offensive line coach Randy Clements has worked with Briles for a decade and knows the ins-and-outs of how the offensive line is supposed to run in his offense.

""We all love seeing Ron Dugans come back,"" McMath said.

""He’s a great former Seminole. I think it was a great move bringing in coach Briles. He seems to be really sharp and really well respected. And coach Clements, he looks like he fits well with what coach Briles wants to do and looks like he’s a good teacher on the offensive line.

""You could see those guys making strides already that they seem like they didn’t make all last year. That was really good to see. It was positive.""

But all the hype doesn't matter unless it translates to the football field as FSU fans found out last season.

That's why most fans remained skeptical heading into the spring and up until the Garnet and Gold spring game.

Over 900 yards of combined offense by both the Garnet and Gold teams, as well as standout performances by quarterbacks James Blackman and Jordan Travis, have started to amp up the excitement level once again.

""It improved it a lot,"" McMath said.

""It was good to see. James (Blackman) played well. The offensive line looked better. We were running and throwing the ball down the field well. Jordan Travis, I was pleasantly surprised with him. He looked pretty sharp. Hopefully with a couple of other transfers coming in later we’ll have a solid lineup.""

But a spring game is just a glorified scrimmage.

Fans want to see FSU perform at the level that's expected for the program when it matters most.

They'll have to wait for Aug. 31 against Boise State to find out if that's the case, but until then, they'll be watching the progress of Taggart's Seminoles closely.

""I think he’s making the right moves,"" Tallahasse resident Johnny Jones said.

""I think that we definitely need to see some wins, and I think he’d be the first one to say that. We need to see some movement to what Florida State fans are used to I would say.""

270,"For Visit Florida, end may be in sight for tourism marketing agency","TALLAHASSEE -- Florida’s tourism-marketing agency is closer to having its doors closed this fall as a Senate budget proposal Tuesday matched the House’s stance to eliminate Visit Florida.

Sen. Travis Hutson, a St. Augustine Republican who oversees tourism and economic-development funding, said there is no reason to push for additional money until the House takes up a Senate-approved bill (SB 178) that would extend the life of Visit Florida beyond Oct. 1.

“If Visit Florida is going to sunset, there is no reason to agree any further than that,” said Hutson, who chairs the Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development Appropriations Subcommittee.

And so far, the House isn’t rushing to take up the Senate bill. Under state law, Visit Florida is authorized to continue operating through Sept. 30. Without legislation such as the Senate bill, the agency will go away.

House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes, said late Tuesday that he wouldn’t “discount completely” the House taking up the bill, which was never heard in a House committee. But he also didn’t raise the prospects that the bill would be heard with a little more than a week remaining in the 60-day legislative session.

“At this point, it’s going to be a little more difficult because we never took up that bill,” Oliva said.

Visit Sarasota County President Virginia Haley sent an email Wednesday urging recipients to ask their state representatives to act on the Visit Florida Reauthorization passed by the Senate and to fully fund Visit Florida. She noted that Colorado's market share fell by 30 percent within two years after politicians eliminated its state tourism marketing function in 1993, representing a loss of $1.4 billion in tourism revenue annually.

""At a time where they're looking for money to plug gaps for education, water quality and the red tide algae, there's no easier way to get the money than tourism,"" Haley said.

Elliott Falcione, executive director of the Bradenton Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, said that he is aware of the current state of Visit Florida and the budget process. He said he is communicating with legislators and other convention and visitors bureaus across the state to make sure what eventually happens is in the best interest of the community and the state.

House leaders have attacked past spending by Visit Florida, and Oliva on Tuesday night dismissed concerns that Florida’s tourism figures would be impacted without the agency’s promotional efforts.

“I would point those people to the world before Visit Florida ever existed. I would point to fluctuations in the funding of Visit Florida and how they in no way correlate to the fluctuations in our tourism,” Oliva said. “And I would also point out to them, what we found in the last couple of years is that a great deal of that money was not even being used to promote Florida. So, whatever amount of money was being used to promote Florida, was not having a direct correlation on tourism.”

House members have continued to focus on spending by Visit Florida. The agency was particularly in the crosshairs of lawmakers in 2017 because of spending that included a $11.6 million deal to sponsor a cooking show hosted by celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse, a $2.9 million contract with an auto-racing team known as Visit Florida Racing, and a $1 million promotion contract with Miami rapper Pitbull.

Oliva added that the economy, along with Florida’s weather and attractions, have a bigger impact on the state’s tourism numbers than the marketing efforts of Visit Florida.

“In a trillion-dollar economy, a few million dollars put towards advertising a few different places cannot possibly have a direct correlation with tourism,” Oliva said.

“There’s a whole series of factors. Visit Florida is probably least among them,” he concluded.

The agency has reported eight years of record tourism numbers, topped by 126.1 million visitors in 2018. In the same time, the agency’s share of state funding has grown from $35 million in 2011, when the state counted 87.3 million visitors, to $76 million in the current year.

Proponents of Visit Florida point to its ability to counter negative national media when areas are impacted by disasters such as hurricanes and last summer’s red tide outbreak.

Unless something changes in upcoming budget negotiations, Hutson said Visit Florida would get $17 million in the 2019-2020 fiscal year, enough to cover its expenses until Oct. 1.

The Senate had earlier proposed $50 million for the agency, $26 million less than requested by Gov. Ron DeSantis. That would allow operations to continue beyond Oct. 1.

The Senate-approved bill would allow the Florida Tourism Industry Marketing Corporation, better known as Visit Florida, to continue operating until Oct. 1, 2027.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190424/for-visit-florida-end-may-be-in-sight-for-tourism-marketing-agency?rssfeed=true,2019-04-24T14:50:32Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

274,Vegetable gardens move to Florida House menu,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - A bill that would prevent local governments from regulating homeowners’ vegetable gardens is headed to the House floor.

The State Affairs Committee, in a 20-3 vote Thursday, backed the proposal (HB 145), which stems from a legal dispute in which a Miami Shores couple fought an ordinance that banned front-yard vegetable gardens.

The couple had maintained a front-yard garden for nearly two decades but uprooted their vegetables when faced with the possibility of fines.

They challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance but lost in court, with the Florida Supreme Court declining to take up the issue.

Backers of the bill, sponsored by Rep. Elizabeth Fetterhoff, R-DeLand, have described the Miami Shores ordinance and others like it as “vast overreach.”

Critics of the bill, including local governments, have countered that lawmakers are engaged in overreach.

The bill says the intent is to “encourage the development of sustainable cultivation of vegetables and fruits at all levels of production, including for personal consumption,” with vegetable gardens defined as “a plot of ground where herbs, fruits, flowers, or vegetables are cultivated for human ingestion.”

An identical proposal (SB 82) was approved 35-5 in the Senate last month.

275,"Jabar Gaffney breaks his silence about vandalism case, other allegations","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Facing a felony charge in the vandalism of his former teammate's car and lingering accusations of bad behavior, Derrick ""Jabar"" Gaffney is going on the record -- saying he's been silent long enough and wants to set the record straight.

For the first time in years, the former football player says it's time to explain who he is and why he believes he is misunderstood.

Sitting in a conference room on the second floor of News4Jax studios, calm and focused, Gaffney told his side to the I-TEAM about accusations that have been made against him, his faith in God and family, and the game of football.

Jenese Harris: Do you remember the first time you picked up a football?

Jabar Gaffney: Yes, 2 years old. That was a gift that my mom and dad gave me, and I just ran with it.

Gaffney's talent is not just his own; it's embedded in his DNA. His father, Derrick, uncles Don, Warren and Johnny all played football, too.

His fans will say he was quick on his feet and with his hands as a football player for Raines High School in the 1997 state championship.

""I was a member of the '97 State team, got to catch the game winning touchdown in that game, and we were the first public school to win one,"" Gaffney said.

He got the attention of recruiters, but he stayed close to home and played as a wide receiver for the University of Florida before leaving after two years for a career in the NFL.

Accused of theft at UF

At times, his success on the field became a secondary headline. While at UF, Gaffney was accused of stealing $240 and a watch from Florida Field's locker room. He was dropped from the team.

Gaffney signed a deferred prosecution agreement for felony petty theft that included restitution, and the charges were dropped. He apologized and was allowed back on the team.

Accused of vandalism

Fast forward to the week of Father's Day in 2018, when the car of Gaffney's former teammate and friend Lito Sheppard is caught on surveillance camera being vandalized. According to the police report, Sheppard told investigators he believed the man seen in the video was Jabar Gaffney.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Allegations of vandalism

Sheppard posted a photo from the surveillance video of the incident on his Facebook page, and people began to post that the man had similar features to Gaffney, and they believed that he was the man with a mystery woman. Gaffney says he didn't do it and doesn't know why Sheppard is accusing him.

Sheppard and Jabar Gaffney were childhood friends, playing ball together in high school and college. But, their friendship turned sour.

Harris: When did it fall apart? Your relationship with Lito Sheppard?

Gaffney: I don't really know? Father's Day.

Harris: Of last year?

Gaffney: Yeah.

Harris: So everything between you and Lito Sheppard has been okay you had an okay relationship with him until last year when you were accused of vandalizing his vehicle?

Gaffney: Yes.

Gaffney insists he didn’t have a grudge against Sheppard and Gaffney insists he is not the man in the surveillance video damaging Sheppard's car.

Harris: So have you seen the video? The surveillance video or the photos at least of the surveillance video that people have alleged is you? Have you seen it?

Gaffney: Yes, I have seen it.

Harris: And people say that it's you?

Gaffney: I say that they are lying.

Harris: Where were you that day?

Gaffney: I was with my kids. I was at church, and then I spent the rest of that day with my kids at the house. We were watching movies and we left to go to Popeye's which is just a couple of miles down the street from my house and came back. That's where I was -- with my family.

Gaffney's arrest warrant obtained by the I-TEAM claims the night of the vandalism, another surveillance camera -- one from the Jacksonville neighborhood where Gaffney was living -- captured Gaffney and a woman leaving the neighborhood in the same Audi spotted a short time later pulling up to Sheppard's BMW in Jax Beach

Gaffney told us he was with his children that day, and he does not know who that woman is in the surveillance photos. He showed us a copy of a Popeye's transaction from his bank account from that same day that he said supports his claim of not being the person who vandalized Sheppard's car. However, the document does not show the time of the transaction made at the Neptune Beach restaurant.

""I have pictures of me on Father's Day showing what I look like. The guy in that picture, he looks like he had a haircut I have very long hair and again there's no tattoos and again the guy at the beach, it wasn't me,"" said Gaffney.

Gaffney told us despite the felony charge against him, and despite the fact that Sheppard filed a temporary restraining order that later expired, he still sees Sheppard as a brother.

Harris: If you could talk to Lito right now, what would you say?

Gaffney: Why? That's all I could say. Why? There is nothing else. He knows, he knows that I didn't do it. He knows that it was not me or else there would be all kinds of evidence.

Gaffney's next pre-trial hearing in the vandalism case is set for May 14 with jury selection in his trial set for May 20. However, his attorneys have filed a motion to delay the trial.

The I-TEAM reached out to Lito Sheppard for comment on Gaffney's interview and he said, ""I have nothing to comment about. I'll let him (Jabar Gaffney) proceed.""

Held under the Baker Act

Harris: There is the charge about the vandalism for the vehicle, then we hear information about you being suicidal or wanting to hurt yourself. What was that?

Gaffney: That was, I don't know. I don't know. That was girls being upset with me being brutally honest it was two girls that I was talking to and trying to make connections with and along the way things got turned ugly and we weren't going to see each other.

Gaffney: They made a call to police and said that I wanted to kill myself and that was totally false. I was on the way to Tampa that day. My son had a band recital. He was playing in the band and that was his first time he was going to be performing and I was going to see my son that day. I had never once tried to kill myself at all.

Harris: So then, how do you explain police being at that house and saying that you were taken and committed somewhere? Are you saying that never happened?

Gaffney: I just came out because I was getting phone calls and they were saying that the police were at my house. I said the police are not at my house, I'm in here. I got this call from my sister I told her no I'm fine. She was like are you sure? I was like, ain't nobody at my house because I didn't know that anything was going on. I had took a nap and I was getting ready to get on the road and I walked outside and it's like 50 guns pointed at me and I just I just dropped like I didn't know what to do I just froze up because that was terrifying. I didn't expect to see a whole bunch of guns drawn out on me in front of my house. They took me to the mental health place and locked me up there.

Gaffney said he was at the mental health facility for three days. Prior to arriving there, he said he got sick -- but it was not because he had ingested pills or was trying to kill himself.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Accusations of mental health issues, brain injury

""When I got to the place, they took a sample, drug tested me, didn't find anything. Didn't find no sleeping pills at all in my system. The police were at my house. They came in, they went through my house. There was no gun found in my house or anything,"" he said.

Gaffney said the women made a false claim to police.

Harris: So you are saying you were falsely committed in a mental facility for three days?

Gaffney: Yes.

Harris: What was it like being in there?

Gaffney: It was tough, but I mean I prayed about it and I was just like, God wouldn't have me here if it wasn't a reason behind it I guess. I mean it did good. I got to talk to a lot of people there about this and I talked to the doctor. He said that I was fine, that he just wanted me to stay because I could be a good influence on people that was the whole reason for keeping me there not because I was trying to commit suicide or because I had anything in my system. Got to meet with people, got to pray with people. Made friends with a skin head. I mean it was, I tried to make the best of it so that it wouldn't tear me down that I was in there for no reason.

Accused of having a brain injury from playing football

Shortly after Jabar Gaffney was held for three days, his uncle, Councilman Reggie Gaffney, spoke to the I-TEAM about Jabar. His uncle claimed Jabar's mood had changed. Jabar told us he didn't know his uncle was doing the interview until News4Jax called, asking Jabar for a statement about his uncle's comments.

Harris:​​​​​ What do you have to say about what your uncle said?

Gaffney: It was very disheartening to hear coming from him, when they don't even, me and my uncle, we don't even talk too much.

Harris: So as far as your uncle, do you feel like he even has the ability or the right to say what he is saying?

Gaffney: No, not at all, anybody in my family that should've answered that question should've been my dad or my mom or grandmother.

Gaffney told us his legal issues have reached the ears of his children. He said he comforts them, explaining their dad is fine.

Harris: How do you explain that to them?

Gaffney: Before they could say anything I said, ""You know I love you, right? You know your dad is not going anywhere?"" They said, ""We know."" They smile, (I) hug them and that's it. That's the end of the conversation.

Accused of domestic violence

Jabar Gaffney has also had protective orders filed against him, but he said he's never hit a woman. But, he said women have hit him.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Allegations of domestic violence

Harris: You've also been accused of domestic violence, what do you have to say to that?

Gaffney: That it was all false.

Harris: Why was it false?

Gaffney: Because it was, it was females that were upset and trying to take me down and one of their words was...one of their own words was I am going to take down your whole empire and they just got mad at me for whatever reason it may have been. And trying to take a shot at ruining my name.

Harris: So you never hit a woman in your life?

Gaffney: No.

Harris: Never hit a woman before?

Gaffney: No.

Harris: Never did anything against a woman?

Gaffney: No, never, never before. I have been hit a lot and I have called the police on women and nothing ever happened.

Harris: And why have they been assaulting you?

Gaffney: The same thing. Jealousy for whatever reason.

Accusations of being a ""troublemaker""

Harris: You have these incidents that keep happening and this person says to you, why you? Why do bad things keep happening to you and do you take an accountability for it?

Gaffney: I take accountability for everything that I have ever done in my life. I have always come clean on what I have done whether it was me by myself or other people with me. Like I have always just said my name and never told on anybody else.

For Gaffney, he believes the damage is already done. He told us his mistakes coupled with his name being tarnished has cost him honors at his alma mater.

Gaffney: It cost me part of my legacy with the University of Florida.

Harris: How so?

Gaffney: I am still not in the Athletic Hall of Fame right now. I am not in the Ring of Honor even though I meet the qualifications.

Gaffney: I was the best receiver that ever came through the University of Florida. There has never been a receiver that has two thousand-yard seasons back-to-back. Averaged 100 yards and a touchdown every game. Nobody has came through and done that at the university. Walter Camp, All-American everything, I was the team MVP, National Freshman of the Year, did everything to be in their Athletic Hall of Fame. But it seems like, after that Florida-Georgia thing and Hall of Fame induction, the hate started turning up a little more. The trouble came and from that point, I mean, it's 2019 and I still haven't been put in there, I mean, I know that has something to do with it.

For every accusation, Gaffney said he has been told to remain silent. He said he is tired of being silent. In breaking his silence, he recalls advice given to him from his former New England Patriots coach.

Gaffney: Coach Belichick always told us to speak for yourself so I am here to speak for myself I don't need anyone else to speaking for me anymore.

Harris: What is next for you in your life?

Gaffney: Just continuing what I have been doing, just trying to help the youth reach their potential work with Scott Park. Since we got Scott Park, we have kids going to college every year. It puts a smile on my face.

Gaffney said he has been working behind the scenes to help the youth football teams that practice and play there. As he helps the children with similar dreams of being an NFL star he is cutting people out of his personal life.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Accusations of being a ""troublemaker""

""I am going to continue to live my life, I cut, cut a lot of people out of my life that's how I have been able to stay out of the limelight without negative people around, without people that want to be in your business,"" said Gaffney.

He told us his faith in God keeps him centered.

""I am not saying that I lived a perfect life but I know I am not close to what I am being perceived as now and that's not fair,"" he explained.

Since this interview, Gaffney says he now has a medicinal marijuana card for Florida, which allows him to smoke cannabis for health reasons.

276,Review: We visited Scampi Grill in Vero Beach 10 years ago. It's still delicious,"Scampi Grill was one of the very first restaurants we visited 10 years ago when we first discovered Vero Beach. At that time, Scampi Grill shared a building with some other businesses on 11th Avenue. Dinner that evening convinced us all that we could certainly be happy in a town with a fine-dining Italian restaurant this good.

Today Scampi Grill is housed in a sleek building on 20th Street and the cuisine is every bit as delicious as it was years ago.

The ambiance and décor today is perhaps less Mediterranean but more romantic. Inside, low lights and deep booths create an intimate dining experience. Out on the large patio, there are plenty of tables providing comfortable seating regardless of the weather. Retractable roofing and protective temporary walls capture the air conditioning quite nicely in hot and inclement weather. When weather is permitting, this outdoor room is open air and looks onto a green lawn.

Our charming server Shina, as well as several other staff members, were warm and welcoming and didn’t seem to mind a bit when we asked to be reseated from the dining room onto the patio where we could enjoy the beautiful spring evening.

A house salad is included with dinner but when I asked about the blueberry and apple salad ($4.90) with baby greens and candied walnuts, Shina recommended it as her favorite. It was a delicious recommendation and I enjoyed every bite of the fruity, nutty goodness. One of my guests ordered the crisp, cold Caesar salad ($4.90) with a very respectable house-made Caesar dressing and another guest was perfectly satisfied with her complimentary salad with the tangy house dressing, requesting only the addition of blue cheese ($2).

Restaurant review: First Watch in Vero Beach serves fresh, made-to-order food in chic space

Mange: DeAngelo's By the Sea in Melbourne Beach is a gem with Italian cuisine

Chicken Limon ($21.95) was two pan seared chicken breasts topped with lump crab meat. The perfect combination of chardonnay and lemon made this cream sauce absolutely delectable. It generously covered the chicken and angel hair pasta.

We are very picky about eggplant. It can taste really, really good or really, really bad, depending upon the preparation. The verdict? Scampi Grill Melanzane al Forno ($19.95) is really, really good! Slices of eggplant are stuffed with imported ricotta and romaine cheeses and spinach and then lightly breaded and grilled. The last step is a turn in the oven, covered with plum tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. Yummy!

But you may be surprised that, for me, the piece de resistance was Puttanesca Arrabiata over angel hair pasta ($18.95). Just the thought of the Kalamata olives, roasted garlic and capers in an outstanding Roma tomato sauce has my mouth watering! And my vegetarian readers can happily enjoy this entrée.

We shared two desserts, pistachio cheesecake and lemon mascarpone cake, both very good and both $9.50, but not house-made. However, they do serve a couple of house-made desserts.

We are happy that owner and executive chef Alessandro Amelio continues his families’ tradition of delighting customers.

A 95-year-old military veteran and former Detroiter who died aboard an Honor Flight carrying World War II veterans back from a war memorial tour of Washington, D.C., is to be buried Thursday in Ferndale.

While on the all-expenses-paid trip back to his retirement home in California, Frank Manchel, the longtime owner of now-closed Price's Menswear in Dearborn, collapsed aboard a chartered jet shortly before it was due to land Sunday.

Two paramedics and a doctor traveling with the group were unable to revive him while his son, Dr. Bruce Manchel, looked on, a family member said.

""It was almost instantaneous,"" said Dave Smith, founder of Honor Flight San Diego. ""He was laughing, chatting, having a good time — and then he collapsed.""

Chaplains prayed over the body and it was covered with an American flag.

As the plane was descending to its destination, former San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman, the daughter of a World War II veteran, asked Dr. Manchel whether he was up for honoring his father with the song ""God Bless America.""

He agreed, and the plane was filled with song, the newspaper reported.

Fellow veterans saluted as they passed by Frank Manchel's body while exiting the plane. Medical personnel, firefighters and law enforcement officers also saluted as the body was taken from the plane.

He is to be buried in Ferndale with military honors, according to a funeral director.

Howard Manchel, another son of the former haberdasher, said that during the trip, Manchel had reunited with his brother Jerry Manchel, 93, and Jerry's son David, both of West Bloomfield. Howard Manchel said he'd left his law practice behind in Atlanta to join the group in Washington, and said his father clearly loved his last weekend.

""I know he enjoyed his last three days — all the attention the veterans got on that trip, people coming up and thanking them for their service.

""The two brothers got to say goodbye. Sometimes, you can't write more perfect endings. We're all going to miss him, but we got to share our love with each other, right up to the end,"" Howard Manchel said Wednesday.

The funeral service will take place at 1 p.m. at the Machpelah Cemetery Chapel in Ferndale, said David Techner of Ira Kaufman Funeral Home in Southfield.

""We have an honor guard coming from the Army, so it's going to be a beautiful service,"" Techner said.

Manchel, born in 1923 in Philadelphia, moved with his family to Detroit in the 1920s, attended Detroit's Central High School, ""and then went off to the war"" in the early 1940s, said his son Howard. He served in England in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, returning to Detroit to marry Pearl Price and go to work in her family's clothing store, Howard said. The couple lived in Southfield before moving to West Bloomfield.

""He never wore his service on his sleeve. That's what was so touching about watching him be adored by all these people who saw them in Washington. Wherever we went, these men were the stars of the show,"" Howard said.

The funeral director, Techner, said he met Manchel decades ago and bought numerous suits from him in Dearborn. Several years ago, Frank Manchel and his wife of 70 years moved to Chula Vista, California, to be near their son, family members said.

Six other deaths have occurred on Honor Flights originating from other cities, simply because veterans of World War II are almost all in the 90s and in frail condition, Honor Flight officials said.

The nonprofit Honor Flight Network was founded to enable aging veterans to visit the National World War II Memorial, which was completed in 2004. The organization plans to eventually focus on Korean War veterans and then those who served in Vietnam.

279,Action 9: Online home selling trend investigation,"0 Action 9: Online home selling trend investigation

ORLANDO, Fla. - Selling your house has never been this easy or this fast: That's what Opendoor claims. It’s the largest online company offering to buy your house within days.

But Action 9 found potential sellers who say it's not a good deal, and they could have lost thousands of dollars.

Todd Ulrich investigated how much it costs and found some sellers who swear by it.

Home sellers can enter an address online and get an offer to buy it within hours.

Chyanna Long and her husband did that, not knowing much about Opendoor.

“Give them the chance. See what they had, what they're all about,” Long said.

She said Opendoor offered $147,000 to buy her house. First, the company inspected her house. She claimed the company found the home needed $12,000 in repairs, including a new roof.

Opendoor also charged a 7 percent fee, and together with the repair cost, that dropped the price by $22,000.

“Kind of insulted, really,” Long said she felt.

She said an insurance inspection found she didn't need a new roof.

A realtor said the home could list for $160,000 with just 6 percent commission, so the couple didn't sell their home to Opendoor.

“We would have lost a lot of money,” Long said.

Action 9 found similar complaints about low-ball offers and surprise repairs.

Margarent McDonald said Opendoor found her Longwood home needed $28,000 in repairs. She said at first Opendoor would not explain what the repairs were.

“You know they weren't responding. They weren't acting professional,” McDonald said.

Opendoor bought and sold 1,700 homes in Central Florida since 2017.

Sellers, like Nancy Ferri, liked the price and loved the convenience.

“We were extremely happy. We actually got a higher price than we expected, and convenience was number one,” Ferri said.

Opendoor sold her home in just 30 days.

Company managers say repair costs are fully disclosed, fees are fair and so are the initial offers, and customers want that.

“They value that speed. They value that convenience. They value that control over the transaction you won't have in the traditional process,” said Opendoor manager Candice Bradley.

Opendoor says it makes most of its money from fees, but it turns impressive profits selling some homes, too.

The company bought an Orlando home and sold it four months later for a profit of $35,000.

To determine if that’s money the original seller could have made, real estate experts say it’s important to determine what your home is worth first.

“I would definitely interview another agency or real estate company to see what's selling in your neighborhood and what the values are,” said real estate expert Thad Chapka.

Long said she'll avoid online home selling.

“That sounds great if you don't know you can get better,” she said.

It's a growing trend. Offerpad is another company doing instant sales, and Zillow, which tracks real estate values, is expected to do the same.

Opendoor officials said its average fee is nearly 8 percent and the fee can range from 6 to 13 percent depending on market conditions.

282,Tampa woman resorts to Largo theft to get help for heroin addiction in jail,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

LARGO, Fla. (WFLA) - A Tampa woman told police she resorted to stealing from a Largo CVS and asked to go to jail because she is ""addicted to heroin and cannot get help anywhere else.""

A arrest report shows that on May 5, Michelle Hildebrandt, 32, walked into the CVS Pharmacy at 2390 East Bay Dr. and ripped open various food items, dumping them out on the floor. When Largo police officers arrived, Hildebrandt asked them to take her to jail.

The report goes on to say Hildebrandt made spontaneous statements admitting to her actions and said she wanted to go to jail due to her addiction.

Even though Hildebrandt lives in Tampa, her father, Mike Morris, told News Channel 8 his daughter specifically went to Pinellas County to commit her crime because she heard that particular jail was better for addicts behind bars.

A former addict now clean for 25 years, Morris said he didn't mind that his daughter broke the law in order to get clean.

""She knew she needed to be some place where she couldn't just leave,"" he said. ""I'm proud of her for having gone to those lengths to try and get help.""

He explained his daughter started using heroin about two years ago after getting hooked on pills a couple years before that. Morris added that it took Hildebrandt three shoplifting attempts on Sunday to even get caught, going to two stores prior to CVS.

He also explained his daughter has tried to get help before but gave up when the withdrawals got too bad. She also doesn't have the money or insurance to cover entering a rehab facility.

For the sake of his 5-year-old granddaughter, Morris hopes his daughter's most recent act of desperation is enough to get her clean.

""There's literally millions of people out there right now that need help, and want help, but they can't get it because they don't have any money,"" he said.

Hildebrandt has priors on her record including theft and prostitution. Morris said his daughter resorted to prostitution to pay for her addiction.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/tampa-woman-resorts-to-largo-theft-to-get-help-for-heroin-addiction-in-jail/1987619832,2019-05-08T02:02:23Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
283,Thompson sentenced to life for murder and robbery of Allen Johnson in 2014,"Thompson sentenced to life for murder and robbery of Allen Johnson in 2014 Video

PANAMA CITY, Fla. -- Derrick Ray Thompson, convicted of first-degree felony murder and robbery with a firearm on Friday and now sentenced to life in prison.

""Feel like we've been kicked in the stomach a little bit,"" said Kim Limmer, niece/ sister of Allen Johnson.

Allen Johnson's family sat in the courtroom as Thompson was given two life sentences for the murder and robbery of Johnson in 2014.

""We thought for sure it was going to be more towards the death penalty,"" said Johnson's sister Vicki Wood.

Limmer addressed the court and Thompson after the sentence was announced by the clerk.

""I have to live with what you have done for the rest of my life,"" said Limmer when asked if she had anything to say to Thompson.

Limmer's husband, Mark, said, ""without as much as an apology.""

Thompson was previously sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a couple in Milton, Florida and Wood says Thompson acted the same in both cases.

Wood said, ""He never stood up. Not even at Milton or stood up here to address the families, to say anything in reference to say anything to killing the friends of his.""

The state was seeking the death penalty in this case. Under state constitutional changes, the decision had to be unanimous to give that sentence.

The family says they even though they didn't get the decision they wanted, they're appreciative of the state for their hard work. They say, no matter what, they will continue to honor Allen Johnson.

Limmer says the way Johnson was killed is a tragedy but she wants him to be remembered as a kind, sweet and caring man who loved everyone.

285,New texting and driving law: What you need to know,"Barring an unexpected veto, Florida will soon have a nes texting and driving law. Here's a look at the bill that passed the Legislature during last week's flurry of votes.

Texting and driving was already illegal in Florida. How does the new bill change the law?

The new law advances Florida’s rule against texting while driving in a couple of ways. First, it makes texting (including messaging, emailing and other forms of typing on a mobile device) a primary violation, rather than a secondary violation. That means cops can stop you solely on suspicion of texting while driving. Next, it more broadly bans any use of a handheld cell phone while operating a motor vehicle in a designated school crossing or school zone or a road work zone. Hands-free uses remain legal.

What are the penalties?

The penalties remain the same: a noncriminal traffic infraction that carries a $30 base fine plus court costs and fees for a first violation; a second violation within five years after that is considered a moving violation carrying a $60 base fine plus court costs and fees. Drivers caught texting will also be dinged 3 points against their licenses.

When does the law go into effect?

Assuming no veto, texting while driving becomes a primary offense on July 1. The ban on handheld use in school and work zones can be enforced starting Oct. 1, with an education period of warnings until Jan. 1, when fines can be imposed. ""During the education period drivers that are pulled over can fight the ticket by proving they purchased an item that allows them to go hands-free while driving,"" said Rep. Jackie Toledo, R-Tampa, one of the co-sponsors of the bill.

What is allowed?

Texting at a stoplight or while a vehicle is stationary is not an offense. Emergency personnel are exempted, as are people reporting an emergency or criminal activity to police and those receiving messages related to the navigation or operation of their vehicle or safety-related information such as emergency traffic or weather alerts.

Does this ban make Florida an outlier?

No. Research by AAA, the motor club, shows 44 other states make texting while driving a primary offense.

Was this bill controversial?

Not particularly. It passed the House 108-7 and the Senate 33-5. Texting and driving has, however, been debated in Florida for the better part of this century. One of the concerns was that this would give law enforcement another way to target black motorists. The new law will require a degree of accountability on that front. Law-enforcement agencies will have to record the race and ethnicity of violators and report the data to the governor, House speaker and Senate president.

Will the new law be enforceable?

Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said enforcing a law on texting while driving ""is gonna be a little difficult,"" just as it is with seat belts. Officers have to be able to see the violation often while they are driving, and motorists are not required to show or surrender their devices without warrants, which aren't readily available during traffic stops. But ultimately, Chitwood said making texting while driving a primary offense is a step in the right direction. ""It's needed when you think of the lives that have been shattered because of texting and driving.""

Yeah, I get angry at other drivers when I see them texting, but I've been doing it for years and haven't crashed.

Think what you want, but AAA research shows people who text and driver are eight times more likely to be involved in a crash. The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles reported more than 51,000 crashes involving distracted drivers statewide last year. The number of traffic fatalities in Florida has topped 3,000 each year since 2016, a statistic some law-enforcement officials say is due in part to distracted driving. Mark Jenkins, a spokesman for AAA, said: ""When driving without seat belts became a primary violation, more people began wearing seat belts. We're hoping as a result of this law, fewer drivers will text.""",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190507/new-texting-and-driving-law-what-you-need-to-know?rssfeed=true,2019-05-07T17:44:51Z,News Chief,Couple,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881
287,"Spirit Airlines needs to pay for anti-Semitic actions toward Jewish family, lawyer says","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Yisroel Sternberg and Chana Beck, who are Orthodox Jews, were flying with their three children from New York to Fort Lauderdale. It was supposed to be a fun family vacation, but they claim Spirit Airlines employees' anti-Semitism turned it into a nightmare.

In a civil rights and defamation federal lawsuit filed Thursday in the Southern District of Florida against the airline, a passenger reported hearing a flight attendant using an anti-Semitic insult to refer to Sternberg.

The passenger, who had been sitting near the cabin galley, told The Algemeiner that ""it was painful to see"" how Spirit Airlines employees ""were just out to get them"" and ""it was disgusting ... how it became personal ... It was anti-Semitism. The guy was full of hatred. You could see it.""

Sternberg, 28, and Beck, 25, flew on Spirit Airlines from from Newark Liberty International Airport to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport with their baby and two toddlers ages 2 and 3. As it's customary, the parents had purchased a ticket for the baby's car seat.

""Upon noticing the Sternbergs, however, the Spirit Airlines flight crew immediately began a discriminatory campaign,"" Fort Lauderdale-based lawyer Yechezkel Rodal, of Rodal Law, wrote in the lawsuit about their experience during a Jan. 8 flight.

The first conflict was over their 6-week-old baby's Doona car seat, which is a Federal Aviation Administration-approved child restraint system. A Spirit Airlines flight crew ""irately"" said they didn't allow it on board, according to the lawsuit. The seat converts into a stroller.

""My clients simply questioned why their FAA-approved car seat, for which they had purchased a seat, was not permitted on the plane,"" Rodal said. ""The hostility and retribution they faced is still shocking.""

The plane's lead flight attendant allegedly said she did not care what anyone else said regarding the car seat because she was not allowing it on her plane. Although a Spirit Airlines complaint resolution official allowed them to keep their car seat, the flight attendant did not allow it.

""Not wanting to make a big fuss, the Sternbergs had little choice but to have the car seat stowed below deck,"" Rodal wrote in the lawsuit. ""No alternative child restraint system was offered to the Sternbergs and, as a result, Chana held their 6-week-old daughter for the duration of the flight.""

The alleged mistreatment continued. Sternberg switched seats to help Beck with the toddlers and a flight attendant told him that it wasn't safe, because there weren't enough oxygen masks.

""Despite being shocked by the tone and aggression of [the flight attendant], Yisroel immediately and dutifully got up and moved right across the aisle to his assigned seat,"" Rodal wrote.

Sternberg took issue with the flight attendant's tone and asked for his full name. They claim the attendant not only refused to disclose it, but got even nastier. He allegedly said he could speak to him however he wanted, ordered him to ""shut up"" and threatened him with police after landing at FLL.

""To the Sternbergs' shock and horror, they were escorted off the plane, guarded by two Broward Sheriff Deputies, while all the other passengers deplaned and walked right past them, staring and wondering what was going on,"" Rodal wrote.

Spirit Airlines rescinded return tickets and issued a lifetime ban for the couple. Spirit media relations manager Derek Dombrowski told the Daily Business Review that the airline stands against discrimination and strives to maintain a welcoming environment for all guests.

""We have zero tolerance for discrimination,"" Dombrowski said.

The lawsuit alleges the actions of Spirit Airlines' employees falsely accusing them of ignoring crew's instructions caused the young family to suffer personal humiliation, loss of capacity for enjoyment of life, mental anguish and embarrassment.

""Even if the Sternbergs were being non complaint and cursing at the flight attendant — they most certainly did not — there was absolutely no reason to call the police and to ban them for life,"" Rodal wrote. ""To this day, the Sternbergs have no idea what they did wrong.""

According to the lawsuit, this is why they believe that their identifiable religious clothing is what prompted the crew's alleged mistreatment. Rodal said that with anti-Semitism on the rise and abuse of power rampant, the community needs to be more vigilant than ever.

""Aboard that airplane, the Spirit Airlines flight attendants were in positions of power, given to them by federal law,"" Rodal said in a statement. ""It is where power lies that we must keep an ever watchful eye. Spirit employees abused that power and now must be held accountable.""

After the flight, the Zionist Organization of America sent a letter to Spirit Airlines CEO Edward Christie Jan. 14 demanding that the airline issue an apology and a refund.

""Terminate all employees whom a full and fair investigation reveals participated in subjecting the family to antisemitic bigotry and mistreatment,"" they wrote and also asked the airline to ""mandate company-wide anti-bias training for all employees, which includes education and training on antisemitism and other forms of bigotry.""

288,Trying to capture a Blue Angels 'photobomb?' Photographers share tips,"CLOSE Learn how you can photograph the Blue Angels like a pro. Pensacola News Journal

Wedding planner Chris Humphries hoped to surprise a bride and groom with a Blue Angels flyover of their sunset nuptials Sunday, but he wasn't counting on getting a photo of the couple with the jets overhead.

Humphries, who specializes in beach weddings, often sees the elite U.S. Navy fighter jet demonstration team flying over the beaches on their way back to Naval Air Station Pensacola from weekend airshows on Sunday evenings.

""A lot of times, they come in as I am setting up (a wedding) or breaking down,"" he said. ""But it's sporadic and it's difficult to know exactly when they will be flying over. Sometimes they come from a weird angle or they are far off in distance.""

Everything came together Sunday for a beautiful photo of the newly married Kidwells with the six jets flying in formation overhead. Photographer Kali Cochran works with Humphries at his Orange Beach, Alabama, company and was in the right position at the right time to take the perfect photo, which had hundreds of Facebook likes by the next morning.

The Kidwells were thrilled and the photo garnered good publicity for Humphries' business, but Humphries said he won't be offering Blue Angels wedding photos as part of his regular business.

""It's just too difficult, there is no way you can make that promise that you will get the photo,"" he said.

The Blue Angels have made routine flyovers of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key on Sunday evenings since 2016. The team updates fans on the anticipated time of the flyovers via Facebook.

But getting a good photo of both the jets and people on the beach is tough, said John Hauge, an Orange Beach, Alabama, portrait photographer who took a beautiful 2017 photo of a family on the beach with the Blue Angels in the background.

""I was just very lucky,"" said Hauge, who wasn't expecting the team to fly over on the evening he was photographing a local military family.

""I saw (the Blue Angels) coming in the distance so I started to prepare and started telling the kids not to look at the planes,"" he said.

Like Humphries, Hauge said he doesn't offer Blue Angels photos as part of his business.

""It's too hard to plan,"" he said.

'Homecomings': New Blue Angels book captures 'magical' photos of team over Pensacola Beach

He recommended anyone wanting to try and get a beach photo on Sunday evening with the team in the background follow the Blue Angels on social media and closely monitor updates of when they will be flying over the beach.

Also pay attention to the direction which the team will be flying in relation to the sun, he said.

""And take a lot of photos as they are passing,"" he suggested.

Photographer Laura Bogan recently finished her book, ""Homecomings,"" featuring dozens of photographs of the Blue Angels flying home over Pensacola Beach. Bogan said photographing the team takes patience.

""Unless the team has posted a time on their social media, it's always a little bit of a guess and wait on Sunday evenings. Depending on weather, fuel and arrival time, they may or may not flyover,"" she said. ""But if they do, it's definitely worth the wait.""

To capture people with the team in the background, Bogan suggested picking a more remote spot on the beach to avoid distractions.

She also suggested sticking around after the jets leave the beach in case the team's C-130 transport plane, Fat Albert makes a beach pass.

""Again, it's a little bit of a guessing game but it's really awesome when she flies over the pier,"" Bogan said.

289,"New NAACP president plans growth, inclusion","MILTON — The new NAACP president in Santa Rosa County is on a mission to increase membership and be more inclusive.

A Navy and Marine Corps veteran, Danny Scott is making his second stop in Santa Rosa County. A war injury medically retired Scott, and he moved here in 1998 before leaving in 2004. He retuned in 2016.

Scott joined the Navy in 1984 as a corpsman and, as Scott put it, he “did everything,” from dispensing medication and putting in IVs, to stitching up wounds.

An award for rehabilitating a comatose patient led to a promotion, which eventually led to jobs driving higher and higher ranking officials — on up to Secretary of the Navy and President George H.W. Bush.

Scott joined the Marine Corps after that tour and got back to the work he loved, practicing field medicine, but he said exposure to chemicals in a bunker explosion would change his life altogether. His symptoms didn’t show until 1996, and after a tour of hospitals and doctors, a Bethesda neural surgeon found a mass and a compressed spinal cord. He was medically discharged from the Navy in 1998.

“Because of the medicine, (I’ve got) diabetes,” Scott said. “I’ve been on steroids 20-plus years. That eats at your heart. I’m still partially paralyzed from the waist down. My legs atrophied.”

Despite these problems, the FBI recruited Scott for its human resources department and he worked for the bureau from 2012-14. He was the equal employment opportunity coordinator for the state of Arizona, handling the state’s EEO issues, with 12 staff personnel working with more than 1,100 employees, he said.

“It was one of the greatest agencies I had the opportunity to even dream of working for,” he added. “Once FBI, always FBI.”

Scott said he and his wife, Shelia, have supported and volunteered with multiple nonprofit organizations including the Red Cross, military nonprofits, the Special Olympics and, of course, the NAACP.

The couple moved back to Milton in July of 2016, Scott said, and by September were connecting with the Santa Rosa County NAACP Chapter 5094. At that time, Scott said the organization was active, but not as active as it should have been.

“When we came back, it’s what my wife and I really wanted to do,” Scott said. “I’m a diversity champion. It’s what I did in the military, what I did for the FBI. That is who I am. I love people.”

As the chapter’s president, Scott’s message is one of inclusion.

“Right now we’re in the process of rebuilding, rebranding,” Scott said. “We’re totally inclusive. That’s where we are right now. I say ‘rebuilding’ because we have to grow our membership.”

To be specific, Scott said he’s trying to bring the chapter to where other nonprofits are now, such as setting up a Facebook page and website.

As far as growing membership, Scott said he and his wife have already brought in 12 new members in the past two-and-a-half months. While blacks the Scotts have approached have been more open to the NAACP, Scott said others, like whites and Asian Americans, have been reticent.

“(They say) ‘That’s a black organization,’” Scott said. “I have to educate them. We’re an organization of diversity. I carry applications with me all the time.”

Scott said he emphasizes that the NAACP charter expressly states it’s open to all races.

Ruth Campbell has been with the chapter approximately 18 years and welcomed Scott's leadership.

“He has ideas and experience in many areas,” she said. “We’re very happy to be working with him. We want to be very visible in the community, more so than we have been.”

As part of Scott’s approach — from seeking members and growing an internet presence — he’s making connections with other entities. The first time Scott was in Milton, he made connections as a Santa Rosa County Chamber of Commerce member and now he’s reaching out to area churches as well as government entities.

His plans also to have a meeting with the mayor of Gulf Breeze as well as the mayor of Jay.

The chapter also has a new website at naacp5094.com.

290,Gaetz: Disaster relief money being held hostage by Democrats | Guestview,"The last time Donald Trump visited this (Panama City) area of Florida was in October 2016. He was just a presidential candidate that no one in the mainstream media gave a chance of winning, and I was just a state representative who knew the media were grossly misreading the presidential race back then.

It’s amazing how much things can change in just a couple of years. Now, Trump is a wildly successful president of the United States, and I couldn’t be more proud to welcome him to Panama City Beach as your Representative in the U.S. Congress.

One thing that hasn’t changed, unfortunately, is our beloved state’s place right at the heart of Hurricane Alley. When President Trump spoke here in 2016, our fellow Floridians on the other side of the state were in the path of Hurricane Matthew’s Category 5 destruction. As he returns this week, it’s our corner of the state that’s still in the midst of recovery from Hurricane Michael, which made landfall on Oct. 10 just miles from the podium that President Trump will speak from.

It’s shameful that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats are holding disaster relief money hostage by adding entirely unrelated items to emergency aid legislation. I’m currently working with local leaders to convince my colleagues in the House to pass a clean disaster relief bill and get badly-needed supplemental funds to the Panhandle and other affected areas.

I can’t help but think that if Michael had made landfall in a blue district, instead of one like ours that voted for Donald Trump by a 40-point margin, that relief money wouldn’t be experiencing this kind of holdup. Regardless of whether my suspicions are correct, the President has been a steadfast ally to us on this. We’re going to get that relief, and I know Donald Trump is eagerly waiting for Congress to get a bill to his desk.

Anyone who doubts that should remember that President Trump comes to Panama City Beach with a proven record of success for the American people. Just as he promised during the campaign against Hillary Clinton, for instance, President Trump has upended decades of failure in American trade policy to let our steel and aluminum industries win again.

With China still refusing to make the necessary concessions to deliver a fair and lasting trade agreement that will benefit both countries, President Trump is again, this very week, showing he is prepared to enact additional counter-tariffs and sanctions in defense of American industry.

That courageous approach differs fundamentally from the philosophy of previous administrations, and it’s delivering results those administrations considered impossible. America First means American workers will always be the top priority, and that ethos has led to a broad policy agenda that has delivered more than 5 million new jobs since Trump took office and the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s.

Despite the still-growing strength of the Trump economy, however, we all know that Americans are still facing grave challenges, as well. Health care costs and drug prices are spiraling still out of control. We need to reach a solution that will untangle the mess that Obamacare has saddled us with while protecting coverage for preexisting conditions. The President has committed himself to that goal, and will continue providing the leadership we need to achieve it.

We may have rounded a corner in the opioid epidemic, but the worst drug crisis in American history is still killing tens of thousands of our sons, daughters, friends, and neighbors each year, including far too many in this very congressional district. President Trump and his Justice Department have been instrumental in the gains we’ve made so far in reining in this crisis. From fighting drugs at the border to treating the problem in our communities, Donald Trump and I remain committed to winning the war against opioid addiction.

In this fight and so many others, delivering President Trump a second term will be absolutely essential. That’s why I’m so proud to join him for Wednesday’s rally, and I hope you and your family will be there, too.

U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., was first elected to Congress in 2016. He represents Congressional District 1, covering parts of the Panhandle.

291,New texting & driving law: What you need to know,"The new Florida law makes texting (including messaging, emailing and other forms of typing on a mobile device) a primary violation, rather than a secondary violation.

Barring an unexpected veto, Florida will soon have a new texting and driving law. Here's a look at the bill that passed the Legislature during last week's flurry of votes.

Texting and driving was already illegal in Florida. How does the new bill change the law?

The new law advances Florida’s rule against texting while driving in a couple of ways. First, it makes texting (including messaging, emailing and other forms of typing on a mobile device) a primary violation, rather than a secondary violation. That means cops can stop you solely on suspicion of texting while driving. Next, it more broadly bans any use of a handheld cell phone while operating a motor vehicle in a designated school crossing or school zone or a road work zone. Hands-free uses remain legal.

What are the penalties?

The penalties remain the same: a noncriminal traffic infraction that carries a $30 base fine plus court costs and fees for a first violation; a second violation within five years after that is considered a moving violation carrying a $60 base fine plus court costs and fees. Drivers caught texting will also be dinged 3 points against their licenses.

When does the law go into effect?

Assuming no veto, texting while driving becomes a primary offense on July 1. The ban on handheld use in school and work zones can be enforced starting Oct. 1, with an education period of warnings until Jan. 1, when fines can be imposed. ""During the education period drivers that are pulled over can fight the ticket by proving they purchased an item that allows them to go hands-free while driving,"" said Rep. Jackie Toledo, R-Tampa, one of the co-sponsors of the bill.

What is allowed?

Texting at a stoplight or while a vehicle is stationary is not an offense. Emergency personnel are exempted, as are people reporting an emergency or criminal activity to police and those receiving messages related to the navigation or operation of their vehicle or safety-related information such as emergency traffic or weather alerts.

Does this ban make Florida an outlier?

No. Research by AAA, the motor club, shows 44 other states make texting while driving a primary offense.

Was this bill controversial?

Not particularly. It passed the House 108-7 and the Senate 33-5. All of the senators and representatives from

Volusia and Flagler counties voted in favor of the bill. Texting and driving has, however, been debated in Florida for the better part of this century. One of the concerns was that this would give law enforcement another way to target black motorists. The new law will require a degree of accountability on that front. Law-enforcement agencies will have to record the race and ethnicity of violators and report the data to the governor, House speaker and Senate president.

Will the new law be enforceable?

One Florida sherif, Mike Chitwood of Volusia County, said enforcing a law on texting while driving ""is gonna be a little difficult,"" just as it is with seat belts. Officers have to be able to see the violation often while they are driving, and motorists are not required to show or surrender their devices without warrants, which aren't readily available during traffic stops. But ultimately, Chitwood said making texting while driving a primary offense is a step in the right direction. ""It's needed when you think of the lives that have been shattered because of texting and driving.""

Yeah, I get angry at other drivers when I see them texting, but I've been doing it for years and haven't crashed.

Think what you want, but AAA research shows people who text and driver are eight times more likely to be involved in a crash. The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles reported more than 51,000 crashes involving distracted drivers statewide last year. The number of traffic fatalities in Florida has topped 3,000 each year since 2016, a statistic some law-enforcement officials say is due in part to distracted driving. Mark Jenkins, a spokesman for AAA, said: ""When driving without seat belts became a primary violation, more people began wearing seat belts.

293,Skinny gators: Are pythons eating all the food?,"Florida's southernmost alligators are too skinny and Lake Okeechobee is choking on sediment, but natural springs long dry are bubbling again because of ecosystem repairs highlighted in a new report card on Everglades health released last week.

The federal performance report, which grades the well-being of Everglades flora and fauna on a 1 to 100 scale, is part of the regular five-year analysis of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.

But this is the first year for the user-friendly report card and interactive website.

Overall, the Everglades from the northern estuaries to the southern reaches of Florida Bay, scored a 45, which is considered ""fair"" but ""concerning.""

""Things aren't all rosy,"" said Patricia Gorman, a science supervisor at the South Florida Water Management District, who has worked on the reports from their inception in 2006. ""We continue to work on improving the hydrology through the Central Everglades, but until we have some of the infrastructure in place to move water south from Lake Okeechobee there are still going to be problems.""

Gorman said the report card is a way to reach a wider audience who can click through the condensed explanations of the grades or dig deeper into the data in the 200 page report. The report card is divided into four regions with results targeting specific subjects such as oysters in the St. Lucie River, water levels in Lake Okeechobee and food supply in Biscayne Bay.

The report covers May 2012 through April 2017, which means it doesn't include the full impact of Hurricane Irma or the devastating outbreaks last year of blue-green algae and toxic red tide.

""If it went to 2019, many of the scores would significantly tank,"" said Audubon Florida scientist Paul Gray, who specializes in Lake Okeechobee research.

The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, or CERP, was authorized by Congress in 2000 as a blueprint for projects aimed at returning the system to a more natural state and preserving what is left. The plan has an estimated 50-year timeline with a price tag of about $10 billion.

Last week's report was completed by the Restoration Coordination and Verification program, which includes the Army Corps of Engineers, South Florida Water Management District, Florida state agencies and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.

""The main message is that human impacts on the environment are continuing to degrade the ecosystems of South Florida and even though you have put in a lot of time and money to improve the system, it's still struggling,"" said Alexandra Fries, project manager at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. ""Other things are also happening like hurricanes and climate change that degrade the system.""

The report notes that sea level rise is happening faster in South Florida than what was anticipated during the development of CERP in the late 1990s and that interim goals may need to be updated.

Six to 10 inches of sea-level rise is possible by 2030, according to the Southeast Florida Regional Compact on Climate Change. By 2060, that could be 14 to 26 inches (above the 1992 mean sea level). In the long term, the compact projects 31 to 61 inches of sea-level rise by 2100.

""Unfortunately the report card does not look very good, although it could be worse,"" said Jayantha Obeysekera, director of Florida International University's Sea Level Solutions Center. ""This is a highly constrained system with a lot stakeholders.""

While Lake Okeechobee and the northern estuaries suffer from water clarity problems, a loss of underwater vegetation, unbalanced salinity levels, oyster die-offs, and algae outbreaks, the southern coastal systems got the worst grades on the report card.

Inconsistent flows of freshwater, drought, hurricanes and sea level rise are working against restoration in the southernmost reaches of the state.

American crocodiles do poorly in high salinity waters, which plague Florida Bay because not enough freshwater can get past blockades formed by the Tamiami Trail and canals.

And while alligators in the nutrient-laden stormwater treatment areas in the northern part of the Everglades are fat and happy, alligators to the far south are too skinny, affected by too much saltwater and possibly a lack of food.

""In those coastal areas the alligators prey on rabbits, rats and things, but those are being wiped out by the pythons,"" Gorman said.

The report was not optimistic about controlling the Burmese python population, noting that even though new programs are paying hunters to track and kill the invasive snake, it's unclear how much of a dent they're making.

But there were bright spots in the report.

The Picayune Strand restoration project southeast of Naples, which includes plugging 48 miles of canals and removing 260 miles of crumbling roads to restore water flows, has shown positive results.

Also, long dry natural springs are again upwelling into Biscayne Bay after increases in freshwater discharges to the area pumped up groundwater supplies.

""Those are a couple of the good news stories,"" Gorman said. ""As we implement more projects, we expect more of them.""",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190507/skinny-gators-are-pythons-eating-all-food?rssfeed=true,2019-05-07T06:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
294,Superintendent details plans for aging schools during meeting at Ribault High,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - After the Duval County School Board that the Jacksonville City Council will make the ultimate decision regarding whether to place a half-cent sales tax referendum to fund repairs and replacements of schools before voters, Superintendent Dr. Diana Greene explained in person to community members the proposals to replace the school district's aging facilities.

Greene spent a couple of hours Monday night at Ribault High School, sharing what she calls the big picture. Five separate scenarios were detailed for schools in that area, and how the district can remove, consolidate and/or replace the aging buildings.

""Our community wants great schools and part of great schools is ensuring that we have high-quality facilities,"" Greene said.

VIEW: Duval County Public Schools' plans for school buildings in District 4 | Friends of Northwest Jacksonville Schools' counterproposals

The event also gave concerned community members a chance to give feedback and that’s when a group called Friends of Northwest Jacksonville Schools took the opportunity.

""We do believe that our school buildings need attention. They need improvement. We have long gone unaddressed for some time and, of course, that impacts the learning environment,"" said Tameka Gaines Holly, with Friends of Northwest Jacksonville Schools. ""So we understand that there are improvements needed.""

She said the group actually sent a letter, with other recommendations on the school district's Master Facilities Plan, to Green earlier Monday.

""We had a community stakeholders meeting where we developed our proposal, or our alternative proposal, then we sent it to the superintendent this morning,"" Gaines Holly said. ""Hopefully, we'll have an opportunity to (have) dialogue around those recommendations.""

Some people don't want to see their school replaced or consolidated. Greene explained the why of what’s being proposed, but asked people in the auditorium to explain what they like, dislike, and may propose as alternatives for the scenarios. She said it doesn’t matter who comes up with the best plan.

""We are here for our students and their families. And if they have a better scenario and if it's one that we can actually implement then it doesn't matter who came up with the idea,"" Greene said. ""What matters is that we're all trying to go in the same direction.""

A representative from the city’s general counsel told the school board that if it approves a resolution to move forward with the referendum at its meeting Tuesday, it would be up to City Council to decide whether to put the referendum on the ballot and when.

Greene said there’s broad support, based on research, but she knows the community will need to understand exactly what new tax revenue would be spent on.

The superintendent will also attend another public meeting at 6 p.m. Thursday at Raines High School, where she will review proposed plans for addressing aging school buildings in that area and gather input and suggestions from the public regarding the plan.

296,Man accused of trying to hit Lyft driver after car crash in Aventura,"Carlos Camilo Nino, 61, is accused of assaulting a Lyft driver in Aventura, police said.

AVENTURA, Fla. - A Hollywood man was arrested Sunday after he tried to hit a Lyft driver with whom he had just been involved in a car crash, authorities said.

According to an arrest report, the Lyft driver, Cynthia Rodriguez, told Aventura police that she was stopped in the middle lane at the intersection of Perimeter Road and Northeast 29th Place with two passengers in her SUV when a black Nissan struck her vehicle and continued straight on Perimeter Road.

Police said Rodriguez pulled into the parking lot of the Aventura Library at 19525 Biscayne Blvd. and the black Nissan pulled up behind her.

According to the arrest report, the driver of the Nissan, Carlos Camilo Nino, 61, got out of his car and pounded on the window of Rodriguez's SUV while yelling at her.

Police said Rodriguez rolled down the window and Nino attempted to hit her but missed.

Rodriguez warned Nino that she had pepper spray and that he need to get back, authorities said.

Police said he eventually retreated toward his car after she told him to get back numerous times.

According to the arrest report, Nino slapped Rodriguez's hand after she got out of her SUV to take a picture of his driver's license.

His wife then pulled him away from Rodriguez and the couple got back into their car and drove away, the report stated.

A police officer arrived at the scene a short time later and Nino eventually returned and spoke with the officer, authorities said.

Police said Nino claimed Rodriguez was the one who struck his car and that she tried to flee the scene of the crash.

Authorities said the two passengers in Rodriguez's SUV were interviewed and they both substantiated Rodriguez's series of events.

Nino was then arrested on charges of burglary, assault and battery. His vehicle was towed from the scene due to his wife not having a valid driver's license, authorities said.

TAMPA - (WFLA) - R & B singer Chris Brown's felony battery case was heard again in front of a Hillsborough County judge Monday morning.

Brown wasn’t in court and the hearing lasted a few seconds with both sides agreeing to a June 6th court date.

The Grammy-award winner ran into trouble in Tampa a couple years ago during an appearance at Club Aja in Channelside.

A witness in the crowd recorded some of the commotion using a cell phone.

Tampa police investigators said Brown punched a photographer during the event.

That photographer told News Channel 8 news the impact sent him into a wall and left him with a busted lip.

The photographer now plans to sue.

The state attorney's office spent months building a case and formally charged Brown.

The singer's attorney didn’t want to comment Monday but previously told News Channel 8 Brown in being wrongfully accused in the case.

At some point brown will be expected to appear in court in Tampa.

299,Cape Coral couple sets Florida record after catching 'Jurassic' swordfish,"CLOSE A 500-pound goliath grouper made a 3-foot-long shark its breakfast on July 12, 2018 in Everglades City. Everglades Fishing Company captured the excitement. (Video from Capt. Jimmy Wheeler, Everglades Fishing Company/www.evergladesfishingco.com) Wochit

A Cape Coral couple had the first-ever swordfishing trip of a lifetime last month, landing a massive female specimen weighing in well above Florida’s official record. But Debbie and Bill Lussier haven’t decided to hassle with the paperwork to get their catch certified – they were just out scouting some new fishing fun, Debbie said.

After the better part of two lifetimes spent fish-hunting in Maine, the Lussiers, both retired fishing captains, were ready for a change. Cape Coral residents for nine years, they decided to try daytime swordfishing in the Keys. But the success of that initial outing may be hard to top: The 757.8 pound swordfish they caught off Islamorada appears to best Florida’s official champion by more than 140 pounds.

According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the biggest Florida swordfish was a 612-pound, 12-ounce specimen caught near Key Largo

With help from Capt. Nick Stanczyk, left, Debbie and Bill Lussier landed this ""Jurassic swordfish"" after an 8-plus-hour fight (Photo: Special to The News-Press)

They’d booked a charter with Capt. Nick Stanczyk and cruised toward the Gulf stream in about 1,600 feet of water, Lussier said. When one of the baited lines was about 100 yards from the boat, Lussier heard Stanczyk say, “The buoy!” Then, “It’s big!”

Bill started reeling. And reeling. It took two more hours for the fish to come into view, as the stalwart Bill kept cranking, fortified by the roast beef sandwiches Debbie fed him.

“Each time Bill got the leader to the reel, the fish would run – and I mean run,” she said. “At one point, I felt like we were on a whirl ride at the circus,” Lussier said.

After more than eight hours, the fish got too close to the boat. Mate Ross harpooned her in the backbone.

“After two darts and three gaffs into this Jurassic fish, Captain Nick was able to get the tail rope on and the fight was over.” Lussier said. Back at the dock at Bud ‘N Mary’s Marina in Islamorada, the fish measured 111 inches from lower jaw to tail fork, with a previously snapped bill that added another 40 inches, Lussier said. “It makes you think … What was down there that threatened her to the point that she stabbed it with her sword and broke it?”

The Lussiers have the sword as well as a fiberglass replica of the tail. As for all of the meat, “There were probably 100 or 150 people at the dock when we came in so we gave a lot of it away right then,” she said. They froze the rest and are working their way through it. “It’s excellent,” Lussier said, “absolutely excellent.”

The refurbished business brings a fresh look and new life to a little building that formerly had been home to Anchor Bar & Lounge, Ozzy’s Place, Bayshore Breeze Inn and The Ship’s Inn Tavern. New owner Massimo “Max” Miceli removed the pool tables and wants to shake the venue’s longtime sports bar image.

I changed everything inside, outside because I want to make a different place,” Miceli said with a thick Italian accent, apologizing for his broken English. “I try to make the best especially for the customer, old customers, new customers. I have people coming here for lunch and dinner on the same day.”

The 92-seat restaurant has a beer and wine bar and tables inside as well as seating outside in a private, fenced area on the north side of the building. A long putting green provides an interesting conversation piece and complements the relaxed, comfortable atmosphere.

“I make this just for the kids,” Miceli said.

Miceli co-owns Sicilia with his uncle, who lives in North Naples. He relocated here last year from Sicily, Italy, where he had lived more than 50 years in Catania near Mount Etna on the island’s east coast.

Miceli, of course, prefers an Italian-style pizza with Sicilian ingredients that differentiates it from a Neapolitan-style pie.

“We make here a Sicilian style. It’s a different dough. It’s a different recipe,” he said. “When we prepare the pizza, when we cook the pizza, it’s a little bit different than Italian style. It’s crispy on the border and just a little bit more soft in the middle.”

But unlike Sicilian-style pizzas that we’ve often experienced cut into squares, Miceli makes round pies cut into slices.

“In Sicily, when we make a square pizza the name is a family pizza,” he said. “But the regular pizza is a circle pizza. I love the circular pizza more.”

Sicilia has at least 15 specialty pizzas in 12-inch and 16-inch sizes, including a couple of varieties with toppings such as boiled egg, ham, sweet peas, fried eggplant and olive oil in addition to tomato sauce and mozzarella. Patrons also can choose from lists of traditional and specialty toppings to create their own pizzas.

One of Miceli’s favorite menu items is a pasta that carries his last name. Pasta Miceli features linguine with a house-made sauce created from fresh cauliflower.

“We make lasagna Sicilian style. It’s different than other lasagna because we prepare a ragú and cook the ragú for a long time, a long time. Then the taste is different,” he said. “We no use ricotta inside the lasagna because in Sicily no exist ricotta inside the lasagna.”

Miceli imports the products he uses from Italy such as the best speck prosciutto.

“When people taste it they say it’s different. It’s very, very good,” he said. “The same thing for the cheese, for the ricotta. The marinara sauce is different because I import the tomatoes from Italy. I use the real extra virgin olive oil imported from Italy with a special order. It’s a lot of money but when you eat it you taste the difference.”

Sicilia’s menu features both Italian and American cuisine. For instance, appetizers include arancino, bruschetta and croquettes as well as onion rings and chicken wings. An Etna deli platter features Italian cold cuts and cheeses.

Pasta dishes ($11.99-$14.99) include fettuccine Alfredo, baked ziti and spaghetti with meatballs. The menu also has salads ($6.99-$8.99), gourmet sub sandwiches and hamburgers ($6.99-$7.99). Desserts ($3-$4.5) feature cannoli, tiramisu and Neapolitan ice cream.

Miceli loves talking to his lunch and dinner guests in the dining room.

“The customers are happy, I am happy,” he said. “Because I think in the beginning you eat with the eyes and later you eat really. I try to make it best for the customer. I pamper the customer.”

Sicilia Bar, Pizza & Pub, 3929 Bayshore Drive, is open 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily. For more information call 239-307-4755.

310,12 things to do on the Treasure Coast cheaper than a ticket to Disney World,"CLOSE Get up to speed on the top stories from FLORIDA TODAY. Rob Landers, FLORIDA TODAY

The happiest place on Earth is getting more expensive again, at least during the busiest times of the year.

Disney World announced in March it is raising ticket prices around major holidays and during school breaks. A one-day ticket will be $159 during the holiday week starting Dec. 25, an increase of 23 percent from last year, according to its website.

Around Thanksgiving, a one-day ticket will cost $139. A four-day base theme park ticket starting July 4 also will increase by $9 per day.

On days with less demand, the price will remain at $109 for a one-day ticket.

For a family of four, that's a lot of dough.

School ends in a few weeks and the kids are going to be restless, so parents: Prepare now. But instead of planning a trip to Disney World, here are 12 museums, gardens and education centers on the Treasure Coast that offer yearly memberships — with lots of perks — that cost less than a single-day ticket to the House that Mickey Built.

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY

McKee Botanical Garden

In 1932, Arthur G. McKee and Waldo E. Sexton opened McKee Jungle Gardens, 350 U.S. 1 in Vero Beach, on an 80-acre tropical hammock. By the 1940s, more than 100,000 tourists were visiting the gardens each year, making it one of Florida’s earliest and most popular natural attractions.

Although it was successful for several decades, the gardens shut down in 1976 and most of its land was sold for development. The site remained vacant for 20 years until the Indian River Land Trust purchased it in 1995. The current garden was formally dedicated in 2001.

McKee remains true to its jungle heritage, featuring 10,000 native and tropical plants as well as one of the area’s largest collections of waterlilies. The Hall of Giants and Spanish Kitchen were restored to Sexton’s original vision, and in 2002, the United State’s first permitted bamboo structure was built on site.

313,"Sarasota family sues JUUL, saying 15-year-old daughter got hooked on e-cigs","Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) - A Sarasota couple is taking on an e-cigarette giant.

Their 15-year-old daughter got hooked on vaping JUUL e-cigarettes and now she suffers seizures. The suit claims the company purposely targets teens with its products.

Jared and Erin NesSmith say one year ago, their 15-year-old daughter got hooked on JUUL e-cigarettes, and it has led to a downward spiral.

""My client got started, got attracted to the mango flavor. That stuff, that has no business being out, available to youngsters,” said attorney Scott Schlesinger.

She's now addicted and suffers from seizures, a possible side effect of nicotine addiction.

The family has now filed a class action lawsuit to put an end to this product.

One JUULpod contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.

The suit alleges JUUL uses colorful, eye-catching ad campaigns with youth-oriented imagery, all in an effort to lure underage smokers.

""They are utterly false in saying that it’s for adults because if it was really for adults, they would try to get it approved as a smoking cessation product,” said Schlesinger.

According to the nonprofit group ‘The Truth Initiative’, underage users typically get e-cigarettes from friends or family or sometimes directly from stores.

JUUL released a statement-

""JUUL Labs is committed to eliminating combustible cigarettes, the number one cause of preventable death in the world. Our product is intended to be a viable alternative for current adult smokers only. We do not want non-nicotine users, especially youth, to ever try our product. To this end, we have launched an aggressive action plan to combat underage use as it is antithetical to our mission. To the extent these cases allege otherwise, they are without merit and we will defend our mission throughout this process.""

The company has taken down its social media accounts and removed fruity flavors from stores. The company also supports raising the minimum smoking age to 21.

315,Ledger names winners of annual Silver Garland Awards,"LAKELAND — The Ledger handed out its 43rd Annual Silver Garland Awards on Monday night at Florida Southern College’s Branscomb Auditorium, recognizing the most outstanding students in 11 categories.

“If it wasn’t for the outstanding citizenship, academics, athletics, we wouldn’t be here tonight,” said Ledger Publisher Brian Burns. “Every one of them is a winner, regardless of what happens.”

Bruce Dube, The Ledger’s marketing director, and Rhonda Gentle, who works in the paper’s advertising department, shared masters of ceremonies duties.

Polk County Public Schools Superintendent Jacqueline Byrd said the award celebrates the students’ amazing citizenship and dedication to the community.

“It brings it full circle,” Byrd said. “And thank you to The Ledger for allowing us to celebrate them.”

The winners were among 178 Polk County high school seniors from public and private schools. They were nominated by their schools in each category. Nearly three dozen professionals from the community judged the competition and awarded the top honors to those whose record of service best illustrates the use of their ability to help others. It is not an academic award.

Lakeland Automall co-sponsored the awards.

“It is an honor to give our outstanding Polk County high school students the recognition they deserve in their efforts to have a positive effect through their individual initiatives,” Greg Balasco, owner of Lakeland Automall, said in a prepared statement.

Jesse Louis Clark, a Harrison School for the Arts senior, received the award for art. He was one of 13 Polk County student artists who participated in Tapestries-Lakeland, which blanketed walls throughout the downtown area with large canvases.

“I feel proud — surprised a bit,” said Clark, whose parents are Larry Clark and Jill Clark. “I worked hard, so it’s nice to gain recognition for helping my community.

Clark plans to attend the Ringling College of Art and Design, for which he received a presidential scholarship. He plans to study photography.

Lois Olivia Glenn captured the award for athletics. Glenn said she plans to attend Stetson University where she will study pre-med.

“I’ve been a part of this for a couple of years now and it’s the best family to be a part of — the horses and special Olympic athletes,” said Glenn, whose parents are Warren and Charlene Glenn.

Victoria Marie Vailoces is this year’s winner for citizenship.

“I’m super shocked — I’m really happy right now!” said Vailoces, whose parents are Tim and Louree Vailoces.

Vailoces plans to attend the University of Florida, where she will study biomedical engineering.

Hollis Lucille Rosenkranz won the communications award.

“I know there’s a lot of deserving people out there, but I’m thankful for this opportunity from The Ledger,” said Rosenkranz , whose parents are Steve and Morgan Rosenkranz.

Rosenkranz plans to attend Florida State University to study motion picture arts.

Mulberry High School’s Jacqueline Flores won the English award.

“I didn’t think I would actually get this, but I’m glad I did,” said Flores, whose mother is Irene Olmedo.

Flores plans to attend the University of South Florida to study political science and then advocate for minority students in public schools.

Yamileth Loyola of Haines City High School won for foreign language.

Loyola will be attending Polk State College.

“I want to get involved in my community — still,” said Loyola, who plans to study nursing and become a nurse practitioner.

The Silver Garland in mathematics went to Polk State Lakeland Collegiate’s Katie Slaten.

“I like helping people — Oscar J. Pope is the big thing right now,” said Slaten, whose parents are Kristine Slaten and Jeffrey Slaten.

Slaten will attend the University of Central Florida, where she plans to major in nursing.

Elisabeth Grace Joyner of Harrison School for the Arts won in the music category.

Joyner, who plans to attend the University of South Florida and major in chemical engineering, isn’t leaving behind her music passion.

“I’d also like to incorporate studying music’s effects on the brain,” said Joyner, whose parents are Matt and Kristi Joyner.

Thomas Alan Dow won the award for performing arts for his dedication to mentoring younger students in stage and screen arts and for his outstanding costume design.

Dow, who is graduating from Harrison School for the Arts, plans to attend Polk State and then USF to obtain a business degree, but he could be Broadway-bound.

“Hopefully, one day!” said Dow, whose parents are Stuart and Wendy Dow.

The Silver Garland for Science went to Jessica Sharie Luongo of Chain of Lakes Collegiate High School.

“This summer, I will start the USF Honor’s Program to study molecular medicine,” said Luongo, whose mother is Sharida Luongo. She also plans to continue her work with Alzheimer’s disease research.

Ridge Community High School senior Hunter Clayton McGill won the award for Vocational Technology.

“I’ve been working at the clinic — it got me a job,” said McGill, whose parents are Justin McGill and Tammy McGill. He has been dual enrolled at Polk State Colllege and, after obtaining his Associate Arts degree, he plans to transfer to UCF as a pre-veterinarian student.

Each winner received a $1,000 check, a pin to wear at graduation and a certificate.

316,"How to REALLY clean lovebugs off your windshield, car, house","CLOSE Lovebugs, those pesky poor fliers are a nuisance but thankfully they are short-lived. Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

Picture it. You take the time to hose off the car or run it through one of those 3-minute car washes and then BLAM! Your car just got love bugged.

They're back! Love bugs, which seem to swarm our highways mid-day during May and October, are starting to make their spring appearance in Brevard County.

Here are some tips on how to clean the pesky bugs from your car.

• For best results, wash them off painted car surfaces as soon as possible and resist the temptation to clear them from your windshield with a blast of washer fluid and a swipe of wipers. It'll create a slurry of bug parts.

• Use a high-pressure washer, such as a hose with adjustable nozzle, to blow bug remains off a vehicle.

• When going through a bug-infested area, take along a gallon of water and window squeegee to remove them.

• Wash them off ASAP. Within days, their acidic remains can erode car paint. Service plazas on Florida's Turnpike have high-pressure washers.

• A coat of fresh wax or baby oil helps keep them from sticking to the front hood, grill or bumper.

Lovebugs myths: Pesky insect plagues Floridians and their cars

• Some effective commercial cleaning products are Super Clean, Simple Green and Spray 'n Wash.

• Stores sell deflector shields and protective screens for mounting on front of vehicles.

• Try wetting a dryer sheet (Bounce) and use it to wipe off the bugs. You may have to let the water soak in, and reapply a couple of times, but it does not scratch, and pulls most bugs off easily. Because it may leave a residue, soap and rinse after using.

• Fill a bucket with very hot water and soap. Using a sponge or cleaning rag, soak the affected area. Let sit for a few minutes, and go back. The hot water will loosen the bugs, and they can now be easily removed.

• Use Clay Magic. It's a car care product that's available at local retail chains and auto parts stores.

317,"Restaurant inspections: Happy Kitchen in West Melbourne, Divine Grace in Palm Bay closed after inspections","CLOSE Here are six restaurant violations commonly noted by inspectors. Wochit

For several days, all looked hopeful: Not one restaurant in Brevard County received the dreaded emergency order from a state inspector that would close it and require major fixes before it could reopen. We were on the brink, it seemed, of a perfect couple of weeks. We would love it if that would happen.

But alas, on May 2 inspectors went to Happy Kitchen, 3014 W. New Haven Ave., West Melbourne; and Divine Grace Caribbean Restaurant, 214 Emerson Drive NW, Palm Bay, and found exactly what they didn’t want to, and so shut the eateries were.

Happy Kitchen’s violations pretty much ran the gamut, from a bathroom that was not clean to grease buildup on non-food surfaces and employees’ personal items stored with or above food.

And then there were the high-priority offenses: “live, small flying insects in food preparation areas or food storage area” and a live fly on a cutting board; “presence of insects, rodents or other pests,” including “dead bugs in flour;” “roach activity as evidenced by live roaches found” (11 of them, if the inspectors’ count is correct, plus 23 dead ones).

Previous restaurant inspections: Honeysuckle, Wendy's, Steak 'n Shake, Thai Thai House temporarily closed

March report: 20 Indian River County restaurants failed inspection

Previous inspections: Galaxy Skateway, Rolli Porkloin, Tequila Azul were temporarily closed

The inspection resulted in 22 separate violations in all, out went the emergency order and the restaurant remained closed the following day when a call-back inspection took place. An extension was granted, with yet another inspection required.

Divine Grace had a roach problem too, with 12 to 15 of the critters found on the floor throughout the kitchen, including one on the kitchen floor under a fryer, one under a table with vegetable bins, on a shelf on the outside of a bin that holds onions, in a hand wash sink, on a wall and in another sink.

Inspectors returned May 3 to find inspection standards met, so Divine Grace reopened.

Otherwise, administrative complaints were issued against: Chili’s Bar & Grill, 6550 Colonnade, in the Avenue Viera; Dogs ‘R Us, 4200 S. Washington Ave., Titusville; Thirsty Oyster, 7 S. Atlantic Ave., Cocoa Beach; and Matt’s Casbah, 801 E. New Haven Ave., Melbourne.

Restaurants that received disciplinary actions in the form of fines included: Little Caesars #603, 2760 S. Hopkins Ave., Titusville ($560, April 30); Jersey Mike’s Subs #13045, 1070 N. Wickham Road, Melbourne ($200, April 26); Southern Charm Café, 8501 Astronaut Blvd., Cape Canaveral ($400. April 26); Asian House Restaurant, 407 Cheney Highway, Titusville ($1,000, April 26); Grecian Garden Café, 2955 Pineda Plaza Way, Melbourne ($200, April 26); Village Time Out, 607 Florida Ave., Cocoa ($200, April 25); and Ichabod’s, 2320 N. Hwy. A1A, Indialantic ($400, April 24).

Restaurants with the most violations since April 23 included:

Happy Kitchen, 36 violations

El Leoncito, 5360 Stadium Parkway, Viera, 31 violations

Matt’s Casbah, 31 violations

Dogs ‘R Us, 24 violations

Happy Kitchen, 22 violations

Thirsty Oyster, 20 violations

Carrabba’s Italian Grill, 1575 Palm Bay Road, Palm Bay, 19 violations

Longhorn Steakhouse 5232, 6691 Lake Andrew Drive, Viera; Village Biergarten Restaurant, 415 Delannoy Ave., Cocoa; Gators Dockside, 4200 N. Wickham Road, Melbourne; and River Rocks, 6485 S. U.S. Hwy 1, Rockledge, 18 violations each.

But fear not, Brevardians, perfection also was achieved, again by nine restaurants, each having had a flawless inspection. Those exemplars were:

Beach Dogs Snack Bar, 3299 S. State Road A1A, Indian Harbour Beach

Edelweiss, 2543 S, Harbor City Blvd., Melbourne

Off the Traxx, 918 E. New Haven Ave., Melbourne

Jimmy Johns #3069, 760 N. Wickham Road, Melbourne

Café O’Beach, 1616 State Road A1A, Satellite Beach

Dusty Joe’s Smokin’ Eats, 3280 Suntree Blvd., Suntree

Port D’Hiver Bed & Breakfast, 201 Ocean Ave., Melbourne Beach

G.O.A.T. The Bar, 786 Apollo Blvd., Melbourne

Tacomaniacs, 3280 Suntree Blvd., Suntree

We must remind you again that not all violations uncovered by state inspectors equal disgusting conditions. Gaskets often need replacement, equipment breaks, and sometimes busy employees simply put their belongings in the wrong places. So too exist technicalities like improper (or non-) submission of remodeling plans, or improperly displayed certificates.

So, when you see those breathless reports — “Fifteen violations! FIFTEEN VIOLATIONS!” — in other media, check with the actual state records for the whole story. You can find a link to the database at floridatoday.com/food.

319,"Development, business changes active in Ocala/Marion County","Additional RaceTrac and Dollar General stores are coming to the area and a Coca-Cola distribution hub is set to return.

The Ocala business landscape continues to change at a brisk pace as new projects enter the area and established businesses change hands.

Last week, the former Walgreens building at the corner of Southwest 17th Street and State Road 200 started to come down to make way for a new RaceTrac convenience store and gas station. The new RaceTrac is one of three under construction in the city. The company also is building a new store at Pine and Silver Springs Boulevard, near the burgeoning downtown Ocala area, and another on West Silver Springs Boulevard near Interstate 75. The Atlanta-based company opened new stores at 3040 S. Pine Ave. and 3674 NW Blitchton Road in 2018.

A couple of Kwik King convenience stores changed hands for $1,034,200 on April 25. The stores at 8955 SW State Road 200 and 6701 SW SR 200 sold to QK Investment LLC, from DIPVIJ LLC, which bought the two stores in 2010 for $2.05 million.

***

Dollar General continues its expansion, with plans to build a new store at 13200 W. State Road 326. The company applied for a construction permit from Marion County to build a 9,100-square-foot metal building.

In March, plans for another Dollar General hit the county for the corner of Southeast 120th Place and U.S. 301 near Belleview. Concept Construction of North Florida Inc., based in Gainesville, would build both stores. Concept builds many of Dollar General’s new stores in the area.

The Dollar General at 9621 SW 62nd Avenue Road sold for $1,880,200 in early April. A subsidiary of Londontown Partners Inc. of Tallahassee purchased the store from Concept Development Inc.

***

Coca-Cola Beverages Florida bought a 27,237-square-foot warehouse in the Ocala International Commerce Park. The company plans to open a distribution center in Ocala.

The 2.41-acre property cost the Tampa-based company $1,868,000. They bought the property from Ocala-based Wilmot Investment LLC, which built the facility in 2009.

Coca-Cola closed its Ocala distribution center in 2012. Coca-Cola Beverages Florida is the company responsible for producing and distributing nearly all the Coke products in Florida. The company formed in 2015 and quickly bought control of the distribution and production franchises covering all of Florida except the Panhandle. It controls territories from Jacksonville to Miami and has four production facilities and eight distribution centers, including one in Gainesville.

Other projects and transactions of note:

More than 200 acres of the horse-centric development Via Paradisus sold for $2,492,800 to VP North Hamlet LLC. The company's principal is Stephen L. Reintjes, a Kansas-based neurosurgeon. The development is located on County Road 475 near the Florida Agriculture Center and Horse Park.The Burger King at 7801 SW SR 200 sold for $1,605,500. The store, built in 2017, sold to Coble Enterprises LLC of Sarasota. South Carolina-based Ocala West Retail Investment LLC was the previous owner.Jenkins Auto hopes to build a storage lot on almost 11 acres of property behind the Pine Plaza Shopping Center, according to permit applications with the City of Ocala. The wooded property abuts train tracks north of the Southwest 10th Street overpass.Greater New Bethel Church and School wants to build a nearly 30,000-square-foot facility at 2495 N.W. 21st St., according to Ocala permit applications.A permit to renovate a downtown property into a bar was issued recently by the City of Ocala.

Deputies said a man was driving a white Dodge Ram, traveling eastbound on Skyview Drive when he thought he saw a trash bag and tried to swerve around it, but ran over something. He pulled over and drove back to the scene of the crash and learned he had struck two pedestrians. He called law enforcement and waited.

Venus Drayton, 33 and her daughter Tiara Johnson, 16 were both hit by the vehicle and suffered fatal injuries.

Markella Griffin moved next door to Drayton and Johnson a couple of weeks ago. She called the incident a tragedy.

322,Jaw-dropping photos show snake trying to slither out of gator's mouth,"LAKELAND, Fla. - If you like rooting for the underdog, this story might not be for you.

Try and try with all its might, the little snake was no match for a gluttonous gator that had it clenched within its jaws and there to capture the scaly struggle was husband and wife duo Jesse and Linda Waring, who own and operate BirdWalk Photography.

The couple was visiting Circle B Bar Reserve in Lakeland on Saturday when they heard a splash while walking down ""alligator alley."" Linda Waring said her husband pointed out what was happening and at first, she was worried she'd missed a once-in-a-lifetime shot.

""On the chance that the gator might make another move, we decided to stick around and wait to see if there would be any more action. Once he started moving and opening his mouth, I just focused and clicked,"" Linda Waring wrote in an email to News 6.

Her patience paid off.

BirdWalk Photography.

The gator's gaping mouth opened once again and she could see its snack -- a red snake -- trying to slither to safety.

""The snake was giving it his all to escape from the jaws of the gator. The gator would chomp down and

close his mouth and each time it seemed like the end. Then when he opened his jaws, the snake was still trying to fight his way out,"" Linda Waring said.

The brawl, though valiant, was brief. Within 10 minutes, the snake was toast.

""In the end, the snake finally lost the battle when the jaws of the gator made a direct hit down the length of his body. It was a hard fought battle,"" Linda Waring said.

BirdWalk Photography.

While Linda Waring has photographed a baby owl peeking out from its nest and an osprey flying off with a bonnethead shark it snatched straight from the water in Tampa Bay, Saturday's sight was a first of its kind for her and she said it proves that good things come to those who wait.

""... It takes patience and persistence and I recommend to keep trying for that amazing shot. The

fun is in the pursuit and just getting out in nature,"" she said. ""You really never know what you’re going to get.""

It took two overtimes, but Martin County High School’s flag football team punched its ticket the Final Four.

Lizzy Spears rushed for more than 100 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner, as the Tigers beat host Fleming Island 18-12 in the Region 1-2A championship on Monday.

“She’s so fast and agile and quick,” Martin County coach Jeff Padgett said of Spears. “All three of those — she can outrun you, stop on a dime and make you miss in space. She’s so good and everybody knows it’s coming, they just can’t stop her.”

After Martin County (14-1) stopped Fleming Island (10-3) on its possession in second overtime, Spears scored on a 3-yard scamper to put the Tigers back in the Final Four for the first time since 2016.

“I think the first time (going to the Final Four) everything was new,” Padgett said. “We were the new kids on the block and everything was new and fresh. This time, at least for me, I knew what to expect. I think learning teams and scouting teams, I know a lot more of what goes into it.”

Fleming Island opened the scoring with a touchdown late in the third quarter to take a 6-0 lead. Spears then knotted the game at 6 with a 73-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter.

Both teams scored on their first possession in overtime. Martin County’s touchdown came on a 4-yard pass from Elise Liggett to Ashley Caicedo.

“T(In 2017), we were ranked No. 1 the whole year and we played Dr. Phillips. They went up 7-6 and full-fledged panic set in for us,” Padgett said. “We didn’t know what to do. This game, we were down 6-0 after three quarters and there was no finger pointing, no heads down. We were ready to go.”

Martin County will play defending Class 2A champion Tampa-Alonso in the state semifinal on Saturday in Boca Raton.

Harmony 6, Fort Pierce Westwood 0 (2OT): The Panthers fell in double-overtime to Harmony in the Region 3-1A championship game at Lawnwood Stadium. Westwood was looking for its first state tournament appearance since 2015, when there was only one classification.

“It hurts,” Panthers coach Michael Harrelson said. “We were in the red zone a couple times —even in overtime. We just dropped a couple passes. We moved the ball up and down the field, we just couldn’t punch it in. We would have a little mistake here or a mistake there that would back us up.

“It was two teams that wanted it bad and they came up with the score at the end.”

Lovena Edmond had more than 100 receiving yards for Westwood (10-4). Freshman Trenecia Merricks had six sacks, giving her 10 in two regional playoff games.

“She’s fast,” Harrelson said. “She’s the future.”

Westwood was the No. 3 seed in the District 11-1A tournament, behind state-ranked Glades Central and Jensen Beach, but the Panthers won the district title and then beat Suncoast in the regional semifinal.

“We weren’t even supposed to be in this game,” Harrelson said. “It’s a tough loss, but I’m proud of what we have accomplished.”",http://rssfeeds.tcpalm.com/~/601683778/0/treasurecoast/home~Spears-Martin-County-punch-Final-Four-ticket/,2019-05-06T22:54:48Z,TCPalm,Couple,"1939 SE Federal Hwy, Stuart, FL 34994, USA",FL,34994
335,Why Meghan Markle and Prince Harry won't announce their royal baby's name right away,"Advertisement Why Meghan Markle and Prince Harry won't announce their royal baby's name right away If Duke and Duchess take William and Kate's lead, they'll keep us guessing for a few days Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's baby is here — but still, we know next to nothing about the new royal except that he weighs 7 pounds and 3 ounces. As for his name, it likely won't be announced for a few days, at least. And since the royals often repeat history, here's a timeline of when the names of the last three royal babies were announced.Prince George's name was announced on Twitter two days after he was born.Keeping to tradition, they announced Princess Charlotte's name two days after she was born.The third time around, the royals waited four full days before announcing Prince Louis' name. Think that's bad? Prince Charles and Princess Diana announced Prince William's name one week after he was born. Even worse, the Queen didn't publicly share Prince Charles' name until a full month after he was born. Prince Harry's name, on the other hand, was shared just 24 hours after his birth. So, that means it could take anywhere from 24 hours to 30 days for the name to be revealed. While it may just seem dramatic to the rest of us, it's actually quite customary for the royals. ""On one hand there's a desire to inform the families before a public declaration is made and any new parent appreciates having a little private time to get to know their new addition before the onslaught of announcements,"" commenter Victoria Arbiter told Town & Country.It also doesn't help that everyone is watching/waiting/betting on the name that the couple picks. ""Royals, however, also have to consider the great responsibility in naming a new member of the family and I expect they want to be a hundred percent certain of their choice before announcing the name and sealing the baby's place in history,"" she continued. Per tradition, it's likely that the name will have some close ties to Prince Harry's mom and dad, Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana. As of right now, top picks for a boy include Arthur, James, Albert, Spencer, Henry, Philip, Charles and Alexander. One thing we know for sure: The baby won't have a prince title, unless the Queen changes the rules like she did for Kate and William's children. Since 1917, there has been an order set in place by George V, the great-great grandfather of Prince Harry, that limits titles in the British royal family. If they adhere to these orders, Harry and Meghan's oldest son would have the title Earl of Dumbarton, a title given to Harry on his wedding day.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-baby-name-announced/27374112,2019-05-06T15:10:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
336,It’s a boy! Birth photo showing mother’s surprised reaction goes viral,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — A photo showing a North Carolina mother’s surprised reaction to her newborn son has gone viral.

Winston-Salem photographer Lauren Jolly captured the moment last December while working with Nancy and Will Ray.

Jolly said the couple had waited to learn the sex of their first two babies at birth, but opted to find out early during the third pregnancy, and they were told it was a girl.

When the big moment finally arrived, Jolly said she rushed to the birth center just in time to photograph the baby’s speedy arrival.

“She delivered her baby in the tub and then carried ‘her’ over to the bed,” Jolly recalled. “About 10 minutes later, they prepared to cut baby’s cord and Nancy exclaimed, ‘What is THAT? Is this a boy baby?!'”

Jolly said Will looked closer to confirm, and fell to his knees.

“We were all in shock and couldn’t stop laughing,” Jolly said. “I’m so glad I was there to capture this moment – that’s the magic of birth photography!”

Nancy posted the image to her Instagram page where it currently has more than 6,000 likes.

“I will forever advocate for birth photography because this is one of my very favorite photos of all time. Thank you @laurenjollyphoto,” she wrote.

Jolly told WGHP that she knew it was a great story, but she never expected it to take off the way it has.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/05/06/its-a-boy-birth-photo-showing-mothers-surprised-reaction-goes-viral/,2019-05-06T13:58:09Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394

338,"East Garden District project will bring hotel, rooftop bar, restaurants to downtown Pensacola","Share This Story Tweet Share Share Pin Email

A new project planned for downtown Pensacola by a private developer aims to take an overlooked part of downtown and transform it into the next vibrant spot in the city center's expanding renaissance.

Called the East Garden District, the project will bring in a ""place making"" hotel, shops, restaurants and residential units in the block along Jefferson Street between Garden and Chase streets.

It will also renovate the existing buildings surrounding the popular Perfect Plain Brewing Co. to create space for new restaurants and shops.

Pensacola native Chad Henderson, founder and CEO of Catalyst HRE, is behind the project and told the News Journal that through land purchases he's made over the last few years, he saw an opportunity to create a district that would continue the momentum of downtown Pensacola.

""I'm really a fan of creating places people can gather and enjoy and experience,"" Henderson said.

Henderson said he estimates when factoring in the price to purchase the land, the project is about a $50 million investment. It's one he believes can help transform the downtown to an even more walkable and bike-friendly community.

East Garden District history

The East Garden District name comes out of the history of Pensacola. In 1764, after the British took possession of Pensacola from the Spanish, Elias Durnford, a British military officer and engineer, laid out the street plan for the colony that is essentially the same streets in use in modern Pensacola.

As part of his plan, lots sold in the center of the town came with companion lots north of town for residents to use as gardens. Thus, the street these garden lots lined was named Garden Street.

""There are a lot of elements of our development that will pay homage to the British gardens with greenery and living walls,"" Henderson said.

The project would include a narrowing of Jefferson Street between Garden and Chase streets to make the sidewalks wider, lining it with trees and adding a pedestrian crosswalk to the middle of the block, although the parking spaces and two-way traffic will remain.

Along the west side of Jefferson Street, galleries will be installed, lining the back of the News Journal's parking lot that will allow artists or street vendors to set up shop along the sidewalk, and when not in use, fold up to act as a living wall with plants growing up the lattice that makes up the galleries.

The project, which is still in the design phase, will be privately funded, but the narrowing of Jefferson Street will have to be taken up and approved by the city.

Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson said he's spoken with Henderson about the project and is supportive of the concept.

""We have not agreed on the details, but in concept we are absolutely very excited by what Chad is offering,"" Robinson said. ""There are a couple of things that will be in the details that we haven't exactly gotten down to (discussing).""

Downtown Pensacola revitalization

Henderson said he believes the project will transform the street similar to the transformation of Intendencia Street between Jefferson and Tarragona streets with the creation of the pedestrian plaza with a woonerf.

""We've seen Mayor Robinson's initiative to create a more walkable and more vibrant downtown,"" Henderson said. ""We think this is a really nice project that fits well within the vision of the growth of town.""

A rendering looking east on Jefferson Street shows what the $50 million East Garden District could look like when it's complete.

The largest part of the project is the ""place making"" hotel along Chase Street that will have 100-plus rooms, rooftop bar and parking deck.

On Jefferson Street, a new mixed-use building will feature first-floor retail space and second and third floors for residential units. In front of that building will be a plaza with two smaller buildings for small shops that Henderson calls the ""dueling depots.""

The old Reynolds Music House building, built in 1940 according to the property appraisers website, will be renovated and become the location for a new ""destination restaurant.""

An addition added much later to the Reynolds building will be torn down to create a new pedestrian walkway to a plaza and the backside of Perfect Plain and the brewery's new cocktail courtyard Garden & Grain. The walkway will also connect to the other side of Jefferson Street with a mid-block crosswalk.

Although not officially part of the project, the owners of Perfect Plain are excited about what the project will mean for the continued growth of downtown Pensacola.

""We're excited to see who our future neighbors are,"" said DC Reeves, CEO and co-founder of Perfect Plain. ""Restaurants, bars, anyone, we welcome to that block north of Garden Street. We want to look ahead in a couple years and hope it's one of the most vibrant city blocks in our downtown.""

Since Perfect Plain opened in 2017, it has become one of the few downtown destinations not directly on the Palafox corridor.

""I certainly believe in what the owners of Perfect Plain are doing and how well they've activated that space,"" Henderson said. ""They have done just a great job in creating a place to gather, more than just a great beer, but a place to gather and really create an experience out of it. We want to build on the nice job that Perfect Plain has done in creating a destination for that block.""

When Henderson bought the Rhodes building and the 2 N. Palafox building, the location of the News Journal's office, he didn't realize at the time the foundation of the project that would become East Garden District.

Along Jefferson Street, the property of the Rhodes building and the 2 N. Palafox building front the entire street, additionally the Rhodes building property includes a large parking lot and bank drive-thru.

""That gave me an idea that there may be an opportunity to eventually own both sides of Jefferson Street between Chase and Garden streets,"" Henderson said. The idea for the East Garden District was born.

Henderson's company, Catalyst HRE, has become successful in developing and managing health care buildings in Pensacola and across the country, although this project is not directly affiliated with his company.

Henderson has brought in Tosh Belsinger, founder of Gulf Blue Group, a real estate and consulting company, to help him develop and design the project.

For Henderson, the East Garden District is a passion project to create a place for people to gather and have good experiences in his hometown.

""I think you can't go wrong if you're making great places for the local community,"" Henderson said. ""If you create a great place where the locals want to be, everybody else will want to be there as well.""

342,Passenger speaks about moment plane skid off runway into St. Johns River,"<p>One of 143 passengers who was aboard the Boeing 737 that overran the runway at the Jacksonville Air Station late Friday said he knew something was wrong as soon as the plane landed and didn't seem to be slowing down.</p>

<p>""It seems like a miracle,"" Darwing Silva said. ""I mean, you never expect to be in that situation.""</p>

<p>Cellphone video that Silva shot shows the moments after the plane came to a crashing stop in the St. Johns River.</p>

<p>""Turbulence started, rumbling started and then it was a small thud, like a small bump, and then it was a massive impact,"" Silva said.</p>

<p>Silva was thrown from his seat.</p>

<p>""I was wearing my seat belt, but I went forward and hit my head what I believe was the top compartment,"" Silva said.</p>

<p>The aircraft filled with water. Silva said he was the first to open the emergency exit, putting on his life vest before helping people, some injured onto the wing of the plane.</p>

<p>""A couple guys had bloody noses. I saw somebody favoring their arm,"" Silva said.</p>

<p>Passengers, even some with small children, can be seen in the video filing into a yellow life raft as paramedics worked to get everyone off the aircraft safely.</p>

<p>""We got the women and children first on to the raft. They tied the hose to the raft and the firefighters pulled the raft to shore,"" Silva said.</p>

<p>Local 10 News has learned the flight took off from the U.S military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with 136 passengers and 7 crew members. The charter, run by Miami Air International, was on its way to the the Jacksonville Air Station when, investigators said, it approached the landing strip during a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>""But the moment we landed, it never slowed down,"" Silva said.</p>

<p>Silva, thinking of his family and two young boys, knew he would do whatever it took to make it back home to them safely.</p>

<p>""I think it could've been a lot worse, and it just feels like it was a miracle,"" Silva said.</p>

<p>Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are still investigating, but they said it's likely the plane hydroplaned off the runway during those thunderstorms. Twenty-one people were transported to the hospital. Fortunately, none of their injuries were critical.</p>",https://www.local10.com/news/passenger-speaks-about-moment-plane-skid-off-runway-into-st-johns-river,2019-05-05T03:38:00Z,WPLG,Couple,"3401 W Hallandale Beach Blvd, Pembroke Park, FL 33023, USA",FL,33023
344,Micanopy whooping crane part of effort to boost crane numbers in Louisiana,"The rare whooping crane that spent time in the Micanopy area, sometimes spotted socializing with smaller sandhills, is gone. But that’s good — even though residents who thrilled at seeing the leggy beauty will miss her.

Now known as LFW12-15, the 4-year-old was trapped and moved to Louisiana in February. The hope is that she will find a mate and help restore the population of the endangered birds.

And coincidentally, her 21-year-old mother, LF1-98, from Central Florida, was moved to Louisiana, too.

Both mom and daughter seem to be doing well, said Sara Zimorski, a wildlife biologist with whooping cranes for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries — or LDWF. She added it’s not known if the two cranes know they are related.

“When we opened the crates, they took off straight away. It took a couple of days with short flights before they made larger flights in the area, which is what you would expect — ‘Where am I,’” Zimorski said. “We released them side by side. They flew off in different directions, but within a week they found each other again. They stayed together maybe a week or so and were joined by one of our birds. Then the younger female left and moved to another area.”

The cranes’ new home is the 71,905-acre White Lake Wetlands Conservation Area, owned by LDWF and a crucial location in an effort to boost the whooper population.

Whoopers were once common in parts of the U.S. that have the shallow wetlands, marshes, tidal flats and nearby farm fields in which they thrive. Numbers plunged because of habitat loss and the killing of them for their meat and plumage. By the early 1940s, only 15 were left.

Since then, they have been declared endangered. Protections were enacted and several captive breeding and reintroduction projects were started.

Two populations were created in Florida as part of the program.

One involved a migratory population — captive-born cranes were raised by people in crane costumes and led to Florida and other southern states by an ultralight plane.

Some of those cranes still wing it to Florida for the winter — about 10 last year — but most of the birds in that project head to Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.

Florida’s other project involved a non-migratory population in which birds were released in the Kissimmee Prairie area of Central Florida with the hope they would breed and expand the population.

The Micanopy crane is a rare, surviving descendant of those birds, but overall the non-migratory group did not have success.

However, Louisiana’s program is making gains with birds pairing off to breed and raise wild-born chicks.

An LDWF crane Facebook page at https://tinyurl.com/y633dcko posted on March 7 that the Louisiana non-migratory population now numbers 75 — 35 males, 39 females and 1 unknown.

They are spread out — 64 in Louisiana, 10 in Texas and 1 in Mississippi. Five active nests — grassy mounds in shallow water — were counted.

But not everything is positive. Several cranes have been shot and killed over the past few years. LDWF has educational campaigns to try to prevent such killings and to raise interest in the cranes.

“Like anything, we’ve had ups and downs,” Zimorski said. “We’re starting to get to the end of our nesting season. Hopefully, if the (Florida cranes) meet the right bird and find somebody to pair with, it’s certainly a much more viable option for them nesting next spring.”

The younger Florida crane will be missed. Two people familiar with her commented on the Facebook page.

“I enjoyed watching Miss Tuscawilla the past couple of years, hanging out with her sandhill cousins in Micanopy, FL. It’s my dear wish that she meet some great guy and have lots of baby whoops,” wrote HG Fuller.

Jen Irey Don wrote, “I'm going to miss my Alachua County whooping crane, but imagine she will be much happier with other whooping cranes instead of her usual 2 sandhills. Thank you and please keep us posted.”

Her mom is a superstar among cranes. LDWF said she nested 23 times, hatched 13 chicks and fledged nine. In 2002, she and her first mate were the first whooping cranes to fledge a chick in the wild in the U.S. since 1939.

He was killed in 2006, but she found another mate and fledged her fourth chick in 2007. She fledged six chicks with her second mate, including twins in 2016. That mate was killed in August 2016 and there were no remaining males in Florida with which she could pair.

Catching the Florida cranes involved teamwork from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the International Crane Foundation.

Areas the birds frequented were baited and set with leg nooses. When caught, the cranes were taken to the White Oak Conservation Foundation in Yulee for quarantine and were later driven to Louisiana. There, they had health evaluations and were tagged and fitted with transmitters before release.

Billy Brooks of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Jacksonville said no plans are now underway to move any other Florida cranes to Louisiana.

“There are three more birds we would like to move if we can, but we’re not sure we’ll be able to. There are two additional pairs that we are not attempting and then at least seven that we have no intention of catching,” Brooks said. “They are older birds in areas that would be difficult to catch. We were looking for birds raised in the wild and raised by birds, not some of these older birds that were captive raised and released.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190504/micanopy-whooping-crane-part-of-effort-to-boost-crane-numbers-in-louisiana?rssfeed=true,2019-05-04T16:17:05Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608

GATLINBURG, Tenn. (WKRN) - A Knoxville couple received quite the surprise while vacationing in Gatlinburg this week.

Friday morning, they woke up and looked out the window around 11 a.m. to see a bear taking a few moments of rest and relaxation in the hot tub at their cabin!

""My boyfriend and I are staying at this cabin in Gatlinburg,"" Elizabeth Strickland said. ""I saw one walk around a corner of the porch, and I ran into the bedroom to look out the windows at the hot tub and there they were!""

The couple said they had a wonderful time watching the bears splash around. They let them have some fun and closed up the hot tub after the bears left. However, she said they even came back later to take another dip!

""We had the best time watching them!"" Strickland said. ""We have closed everything up now, but they have been back once to check it out again!!""

347,I-75 express lanes — and tolls — could be coming to Southwest Florida,"CLOSE Steps on how to purchase a SunPass and begin using it.

The well-traveled Interstate 75 highway through Southwest Florida could see dramatic changes in coming years, including newly configured interchanges and pay-to-travel express lanes.

Changes in the way traffic gets onto and travels the interstate are being studied by state and local traffic experts. Those changes could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

A planned extension of Three Oaks Parkway to bring the north/south roadway from its current dead-end in San Carlos north to Daniels Parkway has also inspired the Florida Department of Transportation to invite Lee County to look at a new type of intersection at Daniels and I-75.

At the same time, the state agency began a road and traffic study in February to look at widening I-75 from six lanes to an eight- or 10-lane highway.

It could also mean the region's first-ever express toll lanes as a counter measure to widespread use of the interstate for local trips.

(Having trouble voting? Click here.)

Lee County Transportation Director Randy Cerchie said its plans for an extended Three Oaks and widened Daniels Parkway have drawn interest from FDOT. The agency is reviewing local interchanges from Manatee County south to Golden Gate.

The state wants its overall plans to mesh with local projects. In Lee County, that effort could also include a smoother intersection at I-75 and Daniels Parkway.

And the county's planned Three Oaks Parkway extension would extend the road up to a wider Daniels Parkway.

Broken into two phases, the first would bring the divided four-lane road to Indian Pony Drive, on the north side of Legends County Club, by 2021. By the mid 2020s, Three Oaks would be extended to a wider, eight-lane Daniels.

""They saw we were going to eight-lane Daniels in connection with the Three Oaks project and said 'why don't we accelerate the Daniels work we were going to do,'"" Cerchie said.

The current stoplight-regulated access along Daniels at I-75 would be replaced with a pair of interchanges called a diverging diamond.

Similar to the design of the University Parkway interchange on I-75 at the Manatee-Sarasota county line, the configuration calls for traffic to make two signal-controlled lane switches.

Traffic lanes would flow from the right side of Daniels to the left so that traffic could enter and leave the highway with a simple turn. After passing the interchange, another light-controlled switch would move the traffic lanes back to the traditional right side configuration.

""It takes everybody over to the left, so there is no opposing traffic, and no chance of a T-bone collision"" while turning onto I-75, Cerchie said.

County and state engineers are already working on the interstate connection with Colonial Boulevard.

The studies come as FDOT studies the way motorists use I-75 from Tampa Bay to Collier County.

Express lanes with toll booths have long been part of the landscape in corridors from Orlando to Miami, but in Southwest Florida tolls have been confined to bridges and the Alligator Alley portion of I-75.

Express lanes are intended to move long-range traffic away from areas where short distance travel stacks traffic at on and off ramps.

""This area does get a lot of local traffic on the interstate, people that just use a couple of exits,"" FDOT regional communications manager Zachary Burch said. ""It's really not the purpose of the interstates.""

Traffic engineers will study traffic counts to see how much interstate traffic is local in the corridor.

""If we have a lot of people in some sections just going from here to there, then we will be looking at something in the future like express lanes,"" Burch said. ""It's a pretty long and involved study.""

Creation of new interchanges will also be considered, including a long-debated interchange at Del Prado Boulevard to provide easier access to and from Cape Coral.

It could also close the current 15-mile gap from Bayshore Road to Tucker's Grade in Lee and Charlotte counties. A potential alternative could be a sixth interchange in Charlotte County.

Studies underway now on future traffic patterns have become more sophisticated.

Cerchie said that the ability to project traffic congestion patterns 10 and 15 years away has come a long way in his five years heading the Lee transportation department.

""We have some pretty slick simulation capabilities where our traffic engineers can load up traffic volumes to whatever number they want to on any road and run simulations,"" Cerchie said. ""It will tell you how road and intersections will perform.""

FDOT's Burch said that data guides basic decisions.

""Once you get all the data, you start analyzing whether eight lanes or 10 lanes; will you widen from the inside or to the outside,"" Burch said. ""It's a big study, looking at a big area, close to 60 miles of roads in Lee and Collier counties.

353,Ankrolab Brewing Co. launches on Bayshore Drive in East Naples,"Two more new venues — Sicilia Italian restaurant and Ankrolab Brewing Co. — recently launched on Bayshore Drive in East Naples.

The new restaurant and brewery join Bean to Cup Coffee Lounge, which opened Feb. 1 at 3248 Bayshore Drive, as well as the food trucks that debuted last fall at Celebration Park to provide expanding options on that local stretch running south from U.S. 41 East to beyond Naples Botanical Garden. Other spots to grab a bite along Bayshore include Three60 Market, The Real Macaw Restaurant & Bar, Molcajetes Mexican restaurant, Taqueria San Julian, Del’s 24 Hours store and the Best Popcorn Co.

Former Kelly Road has seen a lot of positive changes recently and more is yet to come along the growing Bayshore Arts District.

Ankrolab

After facing construction and launch delays, Ankrolab Brewing Co. opened Friday with long lines of customers waiting to order beer and food at the new microbrewery on Bayshore Drive.

“We’ve had a steady line the whole time. It’s been awesome,” said Adam Kelley, owner of the latest local brewpub.

“We are so pleased to be on Bayshore,” Kelley said. “I believe in the next five to 10 years this is going to be the new happening spot in all of Naples.”

Ankrolab definitely has proven to be the place to be already. Its atmosphere pairs well with the extremely successful food truck park that opened nearly a half-mile north in what had been an empty lot next to the Haldeman Creek bridge on the other side of Bayshore.

Naples-based BUILD broke ground last May for Ankrolab Brewing at the site of a former small engine warehouse next door to the popular Taqueria San Julian. Within the steel skeleton of the former building, the award-winning design by Naples-based architect HLevel took shape for the state-of-the-art microbrewery.

Stainless-steel fermentation tanks can be seen through the front windows of the nearly 6,000-square-foot building. Patrons enter on the south side or rear of the business where parking spaces wrap around a tasting and entertainment area with a food truck next to a large patio.

Families with small children and leashed dogs quickly settled into the corner lounge seating or on long, narrow German fest tables with benches. A wall of budding plants and a unique fountain made with a row of 27 beer taps helps separate the parking area from the beer garden.

More seating is available inside in a bar area that can be opened to the outside with two overhead doors. The brewery operation at the front of the business can be seen through windows in the bar area.

Kelley has been homebrewing beer for the past decade but he hired head brewer Lynden Preuss, formerly of Katabatic Brewing in Montana and Echo Brewing in Colorado. They started brewing the first beers at Ankrolab in late March.

“All made in-house with love,” Kelley said.

Ankrolab debuted with 11 craft beers but plans to have 35 varieties by its grand opening around the Fourth of July weekend.

“It’s a lofty goal, but I think we can do it,” Kelley said. “We are going to work day and night to get there.”

The names of the beers will elicit some chuckles or maybe even some head scratching.

“I thought, if we’re going to name something, it’s got to make me smile every time I hear it,” Kelley said. “It’s got to keep it interesting, keep it fun.”

Whose Cat is This? is a SMASH — single malt and single hop — pale. Phalange Pistols is a West Coast-style IPA. Esophageal Impact is an imperial, or double, IPA. Participation Award is a Belgian wit. Famers Hands is a French saison, or pale ale.

Simplexity is a Mexican lager. IMWALKINOVAEEAH is a New England IPA. Temporary Clearance is an imperial stout. Theory Query is a golden kettle sour with cherry and lime, and Wave Back is a golden kettle sour with guava, mango and pineapple.

Otto’s Barn, an American Amber Ale, is named for the century-old barn in Nebraska from which the Ankrolab team reclaimed the age-worn wooden boards and rusting corrugated tin roof to accent areas of the brewery inside and out.

So far, Ankrolab’s Mexican lager, New England IPA and sours have been the brews best received, said Kelly, who is having a difficult time choosing a personal favorite.

“It’s like asking to pick a favorite kid. I can’t do it,” he said. “I’m really into saisons right now. It’s not our biggest seller but it is really world-class, in my opinion.”

Alcohol by volume varies for the inaugural brews from 5 percent to 8.8 percent. Half pours range from $3 to $7, while a full pour is $5 to $8.50. Crowlers range from $7.50 to $12.50, while growler fills are $12 to $15.50 with growler jugs sold separately for $5.

Ankrolab also offers other beverages for those who may not have a taste for beer.

“We have six or seven really nice wine selections. Also, two ciders,” Kelley said. “We also make an ice tea and a root beer in-house.”

Pit Commander’s Central Texas barbecue was going to be the exclusive food truck with a rotating menu at the brewery when details of the concept were initially announced but plans changed so he returned to Plano, Texas, a couple of weeks ago. To fill the culinary need, Kelley has scheduled different local food trucks to park next to the beer garden.

“We are going to rotate out. We have them booked up pretty well every weekend for a different one for the entire month,” Kelly said. “We’re trying to get weekdays too, but it’s kind of hit or miss.”

Jewban’s Deli Dale sold out of food on Ankrolab’s opening day Friday. Mojo chicken tacos, hot pretzels and pickles were the last items left after hundreds of Cuban, Reuben and pastrami sandwiches were devoured by the lunch and dinner crowds.

“It’s been nonstop since noon. Around 3:30 we had a lull for about 20 minutes and then it picked up again around 4. We’ve done over 200 tickets already,” said Julie Dana, who operates the Jewish-Cuban food truck with her husband, Ray Garcia.

“Our next time here we are going to bring our Cuban roast pork and pan con bistec, which is a Cuban steak sandwich, and obviously the pastrami,” Dana said. “We have three more dates this month and three in June the way it stands now.”

Other local caterers scheduled at Ankrolab include the Sizzle Truck, Dave’s Cosmic Subs, The Brit Pit and Vesuvio’s Pizza.

“They all have their own local following, so it’s fun to play off of that,” Kelley said.

Customer parking for the brewery may be an issue on the weekends. Avoid tow zones such as the business directly across the street. Patrons are encouraged to arrive by bicycle or foot or by transportation services such as Uber, Lyft and Slidr.

“We have really wonderful neighbors – Green Door Nursery, Amanda Jaron Studio – that are letting us park there after business hours,” Kelley said.

Ankrolab Brewing Co., 3555 Bayshore Drive, is open noon to midnight Mondays through Saturdays and noon to 10 p.m. Sundays. For more information go to facebook.com/Ankrolab.

357,Arcade scamming device a first for St. Lucie County Sheriff's investigators,"CLOSE If you see a crime being committed, leave anonymous tips with Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers. GINNY BEAGAN/TCPALM April 2019 Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

ST. LUCIE COUNTY — An incident in which a woman apparently used an electronic device to scam an arcade is the first time St. Lucie County sheriff’s investigators have encountered such a device, according to an official Tuesday and an affidavit.

Karolyn Griffith, 30, of Sanford, was arrested May 3 on charges related to grand theft, fraud and giving false information to a law enforcement officer.

Deputies about 3:15 a.m. went to the Gold Rush arcade in the 6600 block of South U.S. 1 and spoke to Griffith, who investigators said tried to hide “a black electronic box with a red button and an antenna,” an affidavit states.

An employee said Griffith was winning too much money and it didn’t make sense.

Representatives at other arcades said they know of such devices.

Michael Shine said he manages the Tropicana arcade, which opened recently a short drive south of Gold Rush on the west side of U.S. 1

“We know that these devices are out there,” Shine said. “We haven’t seen them as of yet in our place, but we’re very tight on our security.”

Shine said there are different devices, with some incorporated into cell phones or garage door opening-type objects.

He described them as electro-magnetic pulse devices that can manipulate the credit counter in machines.

Investigators tested the Griffith's device. A deputy switched on the device and was able to add credits to one of the machines.

Shine suggested other arcades remain vigilant.

“People are less likely to do things when they feel like they’re being watched,” Shine said.

Meg Pizano works at 777 arcade in a plaza south of Shine’s business.

Pizano said she's heard of such devices. She said they have installed alarms on machines that go off when someone tries to use them.

“There’s all kinds of tricks in this business,” Pizano said.

Pizano said 90 percent of her business is regulars, and when a new face comes in, ""you watch them.

“That’s your job. We don’t know this person,” she said. “Nobody else knows this person.”

She said she talks to people, and asks questions.

In the Gold Rush case, the amount of money missing from the two machines totaled nearly $2,800.

A sheriff’s official said the case is the first time the agency has encountered such a device.

They ""are placed in close proximity to the gaming machine and use a radio frequency to manipulate the programming of the machine to add ‘credits,’” according to the sheriff’s office.

Griffith was the only person arrested, but investigators say it did not appear she was alone.

360,Meghan Markle and 7 other American princesses who had a royal baby,"CLOSE With the birth of Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's royal baby, enjoy looking back at these historic royal births, from the 1940s to today. USA TODAY

Nearly a year after her wedding to Prince Harry, the Duchess Meghan of Sussex gave birth to her first child. Buckingham Palace said the boy arrived early this morning, weighing 7 pounds and 3 ounces.

A statement said the family, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Prince William and Duchess Kate and Harry's maternal aunts and uncle, have all been informed and ""are delighted with the news.""

The Duchess, better known as Meghan Markle, was born and raised in Los Angeles. Her newborn son is now seventh in line for the throne, right behind his father, Harry. The child is also the first ever mixed-race baby born into the royal family.

That said, the baby is not the first royal with an American mother.

Rita Hayworth

American actress Rita Hayworth wed Italian-born Indian Prince Aly Khan, son of the Aga Khan in 1949. They were married four years. (Photo: AP)

The actress was best known for her roles in films like ""Gilda"" and ""The Lady from Shanghai"" in the 1940s. But in 1949, Rita Hayworth left Hollywood behind to marry Prince Aly Khan, son of the leader of Nizārī Ismaili Muslims. She met him a year prior at the Cannes Film Festival.

They had both been married before, Khan once before and Hayworth twice, most recently to Orson Welles in a marriage that lasted from 1943 to 1947.

She gave birth to a daughter at the end of 1949, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan. Hayworth had previously given birth to another daughter fathered by Orson Welles. Her marriage to either child's father did not last.

Hayworth brought her daughter with her to Nevada to establish residency in order to qualify for a divorce, later saying there were threats against the child's life if the girl was not raised Muslim, according to a 1953 newspaper clipping. Hayworth said she wanted the child raised Christian.

The couple eventually divorced in 1953 but their daughter became her mother's caretaker as she suffered through Alzheimer's toward the end of her life.

Grace Kelly

Another Hollywood actress left behind a successful career in the 1950s after appearing in films like ""Rear Window"" and ""Dial M for Murder."" Grace Kelly also met her future husband at the Cannes Film Festival.

After a year-long courtship, Kelly married Rainer III, Prince of Monaco in 1956. The wedding was televised to an audience of an estimated 30 million viewers, according to the book ""Planet Wedding.""

As Princess of Monaco, she gave birth to three children: Princess Caroline in 1957, Prince Albert in 1958 and Princess Stéphanie in 1965. Albert is the current reigning monarch of Monaco, the second-smallest country in the world after the Vatican.

Kelly died in 1982 in a car crash after suffering a stroke while driving with Stéphanie in the car. Her daughter survived the crash.

Caroline Lee Radziwill

The sister of First Lady Jackie Kennedy, Radziwill divorced another American, Michael Temple Canfield before marrying Polish Prince Stanisław Albrecht ""Stash"" Radziwiłł in 1959. The prince also divorced his second wife in order to wed the American socialite.

Her title became ""Her Serene Highness Princess Caroline Radziwill,"" and she gave birth to a boy, Anthony, in 1959 and a daughter, Anna Christina, in 1960. Neither made a career out of being a royal.

Hope Cooke

Born in San Francisco, Hope Cooke traveled to India while a freshman at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959. There, she met Palden Thondup Namgyal, the Crown Prince of Sikhism. He had two children, was nearly twice her age, and a widower, but in 1963, the two wed.

The marriage required Cooke to renounce her U.S. citizenship. She became Queen of Sikhism, giving birth to two children, Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. She was also a step-mother to her husband's other three children.

But political conflict with the nation of India ultimately led to the kingdom coming to an end in the 1970s. Cooke then traveled back to the U.S. with her two children, according to The New York Times. She was granted permanent residency in the U.S and later, divorced Mamgyal.

Lisa Halaby

Years after her grandfather immigrated to the U.S. from Syria, Halaby returned to the Middle East in the 1970s, meeting Hussein bin Talal, the King of Jordan. The two married in 1978, the King's fourth and final marriage.

Halaby took the royal name Noor Al-Hussein and converted to Islam. As Queen, she was step-mother to three of the King's children and gave birth to four more in the royal line:

Prince Hamzah in 1980, Prince Hashim in 1981, Princess Iman in 1983 and Princess Raiyah in 1986. Hamzah was Crown Prince of Jordan between 1999 to 2004 until his half-brother, King Abdullah II, removed him from the position. Abdullah has been King of the country since his father's death in 1999.

Born in Pensacola, Florida, investment banker Kelly Rondestvedt met Hubertus Michael in New York in 2007. Michael is the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a German royal house.

British royals like Prince Albert and Queen Victoria were part of this house. It's better known as the House of Windsor.

Rondestvedt received the title of Duchess of Saxony after her marriage to the prince in 2009.

She has since given birth to three children: Princess Katharina in 2013, Prince Philipp in 2015 and Princess Madeleine in 2017. The family currently resides in Germany.

Waiting any amount of time for a needed organ can feel like a lifetime for patients and their families.

According to Donate Life America, more than 110,000 adults and children in the U.S. are awaiting organ transplants and another person is added to the transplant waiting list every 10 minutes.

Not all are able to receive organs in time, with 8,000 people dying each year, or 22 people each day, because the organs they need are not donated in time.

The need for organs stretches across demographics, with all races, ethnicities and age groups represented on the waitlist.

Infant gets a liver transplant

Rayna Kamon, 10, of Satellite Beach was just 2 months old when her parents, both medical professionals, realized something was wrong.

After a series of tests, the baby was diagnosed with biliary atresia, a rare disease that affects the drainage of bile from the liver in infants.

A surgery to fix the disease was unsuccessful. Five months after the diagnosis, Rayna was placed on a liver transplant list. Given her age and size, the pool of potential liver donors was small.

“Both her father and I worked with organ procurement agencies in our careers prior to having Rayna and always knew how special organ donation was,"" said Corrinne Kamon, Rayna’s mother. ""But being on the recipient side was eye opening.""

Just 11 days after being placed on the waitlist, the family received word that a potential donor liver could be a match. Seven-month-old Rayna was in surgery less than 24 hours later at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami.

“We were elated that she was going to have a chance at life but also extremely sad and distraught over knowing another child was gone and that the family was grieving,” Corrinne Kamon said. “We will always be in debt for the gift of life they gave at their darkest hour.”

Today, Rayna is a healthy 10-year-old with no obvious signs that she underwent such a life-altering experience as a baby. She speaks matter-of-factly of the surgery and of her belief that organ donation is the right choice.

“It’s so easy to register as an organ donor,” Rayna said.

The privacy of the donor is respected in transplant cases so it is common that recipients never learn the donor identities.

“We know that Rayna’s liver came from a 2-year-old boy in Georgia. I looked up news stories from around that time but have never been able to definitively figure out who her donor was,” Corrinne Kamon said.

Each year on the anniversary of Rayna’s transplant, she and her loved ones celebrate “liver day,” taking time to give thanks to the family of the donor.

“I try to think about that little boy and his family,"" Rayna said. ""I want them to know how thankful I am that I have life.""

Cancer survivor gets needed liver

Tom Stokes, 70, of Melbourne will celebrate the second anniversary of his liver transplant in July.

His need for a new liver stemmed from a case of hepatitis that was discovered after he donated blood in the early 1990s. Stokes treated the disease for 20 years and eventually developed liver cancer.

“I drank my last alcoholic drink in October of 2015. I was a moderate drinker, usually a beer or wine with friends,"" Stokes said. ""But I knew that if I was to ask for the gift of a new liver, I needed to commit to keeping it healthy.""

Already a runner, Stokes bumped up his fitness routine and added multi-sport components in an attempt to get his body in the best shape possible to withstand a likely liver transplant surgery and recovery.

In May of 2017, Stokes was officially added to the liver transplant list. Two months later, he received a call that he had been placed with a liver.

“I had completed a sprint triathlon that same morning. I showered and went to bed,"" Stokes recalled. ""Around 10:30 p.m. I got a call saying they had a liver for me that I needed to go right away.""

Stokes immediately went to the Transplant Institute at Advent Health in Orlando to prep for surgery. His wife, Deb Stokes, was visiting family out of state and hopped on the first flight she could find home.

The surgery lasted five hours and was completed without any complications.

For Stokes, the liver transplant sparked an even greater desire to push the limits of his healthy body, despite physician warnings that he may never be “100 percent” again.

“That really irked me when I was told that,” Stokes said. “I thought, well, what do you know? I’ll get back to better than 100 percent.”

Inspired to surpass expectations, he ran the Tailgate 2-miler race just six weeks after his surgery. In November of 2017, he ran the Space Coast Marathon relay, splitting the marathon course with his wife.

“At no point in my transplant journey was I afraid of dying,"" Stokes said. ""My biggest fear was losing the active lifestyle my wife and I had. I wanted to get back to it just as soon as I could.""

Today the couple is back to their normal routine, running and cycling with local groups several days a week and racing in some capacity nearly every weekend. Tom Stokes runs faster than he did pre-transplant. Both are advocates for organ donation.

“As sad as the circumstances typically are surrounding an untimely death, you can’t take it with you,” Tom Stokes said. “And what a gift of life to give to another family.”

Like the Kamons, Tom Stokes does not know the identity of his donor.

“I know he was younger than me at the time of the surgery but that is about all I know,” he said. “But I am forever thankful that he was an organ donor or that his family made that decision.”

362,Sano’s first-inning bomb leads Blue Wahoos run barrage in series win,"CLOSE Here are five spots in Blue Wahoos Stadium for the best views. Eric J. Wallace / Wochit, Wochit

The Blue Wahoos encountered their only, early-season bump, to start a weekend homestand.

But they finished it with exclamation. Did they ever.

The Blue Wahoos answered a three-game losing streak, including two at home, by powering home 30 runs in three days, highlighted by Sunday’s 9-2 win against the Biloxi Shuckers that kept an unbeaten series streak intact.

“Those last couple days were really fun watching these guys play,” said Blue Wahoos manager Ramon Borrego.

It was a sentiment that could be found across Blue Wahoos Stadium, after a crowd of 3,998 on Cinco de Mayo Day watched the Wahoos (20-10) become the second-Double-A team in minor league baseball to reach 20 wins.

“I just think it shows this team… and the fight we have,” said outfielder Jaylin Davis, who helped ignite Sunday’s run barrage with a first-inning homer and raised his batting average to .307.

In winning all six series to start this season – the most recent one after being down 0-2 – the Blue Wahoos hit the road with good vibe. They exited their clubhouse late Sunday afternoon to board a charter bus to begin a 10-day road swing.

First up, was a 247-mile trip Sunday night to Pearl, Miss., where they begin a five-game series Monday against the Mississippi Braves, the Atlanta Braves-owned, Double-A affiliate. The M-Braves trail the Blue Wahoos by four games in the Southern League’s South Division.

Following that series, the Blue Wahoos head to Chattanooga, Tenn. to face the Chattanooga Lookouts, which is managed as a Cincinnati Reds affiliate by former Blue Wahoos manager Pat Kelly. The Lookouts were the Twins affiliate for the past four seasons.

“It is a good start,” said Borrego, describing the team’s best start in Blue Wahoos franchise history. “It’s not done yet. This is the beginning. We have to think game by game every time.

“Every day it’s about today. What are we doing today? We do that, and we are going to be strong.”

In terms of strength, the fans Sunday saw it right away from Miguel Sano, the 2017 American League All-Star, playing his second game for the Blue Wahoos on an injury rehab assignment in hopes of rejoining the Minnesota Twins.

After Luis Arraez and Alex Kirilloff opened the first inning with singles, the massive Sano blasted a 1-1 pitch as moon shot over left field and toward Pensacola Bay. With one out, Davis followed with a solo homer.

Just like that, it was 4-0.

“Everybody loves MIggy,” said Borrego, who first met Sano 10 years ago when managing in the Dominican Republic. “He is a big league guy with experience…and one of the things for him was just trying to help everybody (here).

“That was a towering homer. It is great for fans to see a guy like him playing for us.”

The plan is for Sano to continue playing for Pensacola the next four games at Mississippi, then advance to Triple-A Rochester (N.Y.) Red Wings before returning to the Twins.

The early lead was kept by Blue Wahoos starter Griffin Jax (2-0), who produced his longest start of the season in working 6.2 innings. He gave up two unearned runs and five hits to lower his Southern League best ERA to 0.53.

Jax, the Air Force Academy graduate, has allowed just two earned runs in six starts.

“I’ve been feeling solid since spring training, so I am trying to keep the train moving forward,” who has risen among the Twins’ top 25 overall prospects by MLB Pipeline. “We are having a lot of fun out there.

More: Highly touted prospect Alex Kirillof joining Blue Wahoos

“It’s a good group of guys and we have been playing together for awhile. We don’t let what happened in the past affect us too much.”

The Blue Wahoos finished Sunday’s homestand with nine hits, led by Davis and Arraez with two each. The 30 runs scored from Friday-Sunday followed a 1-0 loss Thursday and five runs scored in three losses.

“I had a little meeting with those guys, after we lost those 2 games and everything came together, offense, defense, pitching.. That’s what you are looking for to win the games,” Borrego said.

The Blue Wahoos also had one of their season’s biggest promotional nights with their fourth Star Wars Night on May 4, a play on the Star Wars “Force Be With You” and now-celebratory day worldwide for the movie.

The Blue Wahoos’ creative services team leaders, Adam Waldron and Derek Diamond, spend months in planning the event. The Blue Wahoos had 12 Star Wars characters, more than double the three previous Star Wars Nights in recent seasons.

""It's a long process, because we have to approval from Lucasfilm (Star Wars film producer),"" said Diamond, assistant director. ""The (Star Wars characters) groups who come out, they have to have permission from Lucasfilm to come out. And we also need the rights to play video clips, music, all of the Star Wars content.

""You have to fill out an application. And you need a separate one if you are sporting event. So it is a multistep process.""

The result was a festive experience among families, which was the goal. The Star Wars Night attracts some non-baseball fans.

""You are talking about a film franchise which has spanned 40 years,"" said Waldron, the Blue Wahoos creative services director. ""It is two and three generations of people and it is a multi-billon dollar franchise. Star Wars and Marvel are the two that have brought in more than a billion dollars.

""So now you have the grandparents, who saw the originals, the parents who saw the sequels and now the kids who watch the new movies. So it spans an entire family.""

364,Here are six suggested starting points for the new Algae Task Force,"CLOSE Mary Radabaugh, manager of Central Marine Stuart, shares a summary of the marina's frequent fight with toxic algae-filled summers. Leah Voss, leah.voss@tcpalm.com

Gov. Ron DeSantis fulfilled one of his campaign promises by naming a five-person Blue-Green Algae Task Force. The Task Force will work under the direction of Thomas Frazer, the state's first chief science officer, who begins in his new role Monday.

""It's one thing to go and get the resources,"" DeSantis said during the announcement at Nathaniel P. Reed National Wildlife Refuge in Hobe Sound, ""but I want to make sure when we are applying those resources, we are prioritizing the projects which are most urgent, and doing what we can to effectively deal with the nutrients, to deal with the algae, and to deal with the red tide.""

""You can actually see it here."" (Photo: XAVIER MASCAREÑAS/TCPALM)

DeSantis said the task force will:

Identify opportunities to fund priority projects with state, local and federal funding;

Build on DEP's updated Basin Management Action Plans;

View and provide the largest and most meaningful nutrient reductions in key waterways.

More: Ron DeSantis announces newly-formed Blue-Green Algae Task Force

What will that look like? It may be a few weeks before we start getting word from the first meetings convened by this Task Force.

I'm a veteran observer of how badly toxic algae can foul Florida's waterways. Along with millions of Floridians, I suffered through the scuzzy harmful algae outbreaks of 2005, 2013, 2016 and 2018. I never want to see it again, but I know I will. Probably way too soon.

I took it upon myself to offer up six steps I think the Task Force should take. Perhaps these could lead to future recommendations the Task Force hands over to the Department of Environmental Protection, state Legislature and Gov. DeSantis. Then it will be up to them to act.

Here are my suggestions:

Step 1: Determine where there is problematic algae now. Short-term solutions should take precedence over long-term solutions. Believe it or not, there is already a bloom of cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa, according to a DEP sample, west of Lake Okeechobee in the waters near the W.P. Franklin Lock and Dam at Alva. It's bright green and getting thicker each warm sunny day. The Task Force, in my opinion, should quickly identify which algae is in which location. Determine how bad the outbreaks are. Evaluate which ones are the most harmful to humans. Calculate which ones are the most widespread. And then project which ones will become the biggest problems in the coming weeks and months.

Step 2: Stop its spread. Don’t let it move from one place to another. Contain it. This should be treated like we treat any human contagion. After all, it has been linked to diseases of the liver and brain. In February, at the Army Corps of Engineers’ Lake Okeechobee System Operating Manual scoping meeting in Stuart, Capt. Rufus Wakeman of Jensen Beach addressed this in his comments: ""Last year, the Army Corps knowingly dumped toxic algae into our communities — That’s messed up.” It is. These toxic algae blooms need to be managed as a human health crisis similar to how the health department manages an outbreak of Hepatitis A, measles or MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).

Step 3: Mobilize resources to kill it or remove it. What seriously lacked in the past ""lost summers"" of algae outbreaks was action. There was a little monitoring. Some measuring. There was a ton of complaining and protesting to elected officials, but very little actual action. Many homes in Florida have the technology in their backyard pools to remove algae. Filters, scrubbers, chlorination or other chemicals will do the trick. The problem, of course, is scaling up the processes to be effective near a canal, lake or river. It sounds daunting. But if we can use a voice-activated assistant to bring us tacos with a drone, we can totally handle this.

Step 4: Identify nutrient sources. This is a step toward longer-term solutions, but find the nutrient sources. When it comes to Lake Okeechobee, Florida's largest lake, we know it has been pounded with phosphorous and nitrogen for decades. We know almost all the water comes from the north. So figure out where, when and how this happened.

Buy Photo Central Marine on Aug. 6, 2018. (Photo: LEAH VOSS/TCPALM)

Step 5: Stop the nutrient loading into Florida's waterways. The Basin Management Action Plan system put in place during former Gov. Rick Scott's administration is a farce. How does a community receive credits for cleaning water by publishing a brochure? Fix this. Actually stop the nutrients from running off lands and into waterways. Get serious about fixing and removing septic tanks, spreading biosolids from municipal wastewater systems, applying fertilizer and applying other destructive pesticides.

Step 6: Address legacy nutrient loads. Yes, it's a challenging problem. So let's roll up our sleeves and do something about it. Scoop out the muck. Put it somewhere, at least temporarily until we can destroy it properly.

If I was to add one more step, it would be to get cracking. Florida's next historic toxic algae outbreak could be only a couple of rainstorms and a few hot days away. June 21, the first day of summer and the longest day of the year, is rapidly approaching. What we learned in past years is that the toxic algae really celebrates this day by blooming with added fervor.

The last thing we need is to ruin the state's once-pristine waters by smothering them annually with blue-green gook.

After being alerted by a passerby Tuesday that a couple appeared to be ready to fornicate in front of the Key West Police Station, an officer caught the man and woman in action, so to speak.

The man, Gary Hill, was found with his shorts down around his ankles; while the woman, Crystal Frances, was wearing neither pants or underwear.

When the officer asked the couple what they were doing, Hill replied, ""It was a Key West moment.""

While Hill followed the officer's orders and put his clothes back on, Frances refused, leading to the officer to believe she was intoxicated.

Without being prompted, Hill blurted out to the officer, ""I'm horny"" and admitted the couple had drank a pint of vodka earlier in the evening. A bottle of vodka was found next to the spot where Hill and Frances were having sex.

Hill was arrested and charged with Lewd & Lascivious Indecent Exposure | Having sex in public, while Frances was taken to the hospital. Once she is released from the hospital, a warrant is expected to be issued for her arrest.

369,Who are Florida State's top defensive recruiting targets?,"Spring football is over and the Florida State coaching staff has turned its full attention to recruiting.

The Seminoles have hosted multiple prospects this week and will hit the road for the spring evaluation period starting Monday.

Here's a look at the top defensive targets the Seminoles are recruiting at each position heading into that period. The top offensive targets that FSU is recruiting were released Saturday.

More: Who are Florida State's top offensive recruiting targets?

More: Florida State lands commitment from three-star defensive end Josh Griffis

Defensive End

FSU picked up a commitment from three-star defensive end Friday, but will look to add at least one more this recruiting cycle.

The top target is four-star Chantz Williams out of Orange Park, FL. Williams is the No. 4 weak-side defensive end in the 247Sports composite rankings and the No. 102 overall player. He's an exceptional athlete with great burst that gives offensive tackles fits when trying to block him.

Williams visited FSU during the spring and is in the mix to land him.

Three-star defensive end Elijah Roberts is next up on the list. He's visited FSU twice this spring and has a lot of interest in the Seminoles.

Defensive Tackle

FSU signed two defensive tackles in last year's class, but neither are expected to come in and make an immediate impact for the Seminoles.

FSU would like to add multiple interior defensive linemen in this recruiting class. Four-stars Jalen Carter and McKinnley Jackson are the two recruits at the top of the list that have visited FSU this spring.

Odell Haggins has made Carter a priority and at least one coach speaks with him daily. Jackson has visited FSU multiple times from Mississippi over the past year and his relationship with Haggins stands out.

FSU has other options at the position, but these two have separated themselves from the rest of the pack.

Linebacker

FSU already has two of the top linebackers in the country in the fold with commitments from four-stars Keyshawn Greene and Stephen Dix Jr.

The Seminoles would like to add one more linebacker this cycle after bringing in three during the 2019 cycle. Four-star Jayion McCluster is the primary target to fill that role.

McCluster has named FSU his leader and has visited Tallahassee multiple times this spring. He's still taking visits, but could be closing in a decision soon.

Cornerback

FSU took four cornerbacks last recruiting cycle and already have two in the fold with four-stars Isaiah Dunson and Jalen Harrell.

One name to watch is three-star Kendall Dennis. Dennis has been on campus multiple times this spring, but FSU may be full up at the cornerback position with the addition of Harrell on Saturday.

Safety

FSU signed two safeties in the 2019 class and have two already committed for 2020 with four-stars Jadarius McKnight and Demorie Tate. Tate could play corner, but is better suited to safety.

The Seminoles could be looking to add one more this cycle and there are a couple of recruits that standout.

Four-star Miami commit Keshawn Washington and three-star Ja'Marquis Johnson have both visited FSU this spring and have the attention of the coaching staff.

Washington called FSU his ""top school"" following his spring game visit despite his commitment to Miami. Johnson has visited FSU six times in the past year.

Punter

FSU needs to add a punter in this recruiting class with Logan Tyler set to graduate following the 2019 season.

Punter Sam Johnson was on campus earlier this spring. He's the No. 3 ranked punter in the country according to Kohl's Kicking. Johnson is good friends with FSU kicker signee Ryan Fitzgerald.

370,Annual rare fruit tree sale lures shoppers from across Florida,"'It's like Black Friday. It's very busy.'

MANATEE COUNTY — Before heading to the grocery store, Southwest Florida residents are unlikely to add soursop, jackfruit, carambola, sapodilla or white sapota to their shopping lists.

Next month, however, they have a once-a-year opportunity to find all sorts of exotic fruits they would be unlikely to see on a supermarket’s produce aisle or even at a local farmer’s market.

On May 19, the Manatee Rare Fruit Council will conduct its annual tree sale. Vendors from throughout the state will offer not just uncommon fruit trees that originated in Asia and other continents but bushes, vines, herbs, spices, vegetables and fertilizer.

“It’s a unique opportunity,” council member Darryl McCullough said of the event. About 5,000 otherwise hard-to-find plants from more than 20 vendors will be in a single, air-conditioned space, he said of the Bradenton Area Convention Center.

Floridians from across the state get in line hours in advance, anxious to get the best selections.

“The first couple of hours are really intense,” McCullough said. “It’s like Black Friday. It’s very busy.”

McCullough said 1,000 or more excited shoppers usually attend.

Credit cards are not accepted. Shoppers should bring cash or, if they have identification, checks. An ATM will be available. Transactions can range from $50 to hundreds of dollars depending on how many trees and other plants are bought.

“Most people buy three to eight trees,” McCullough said.

The council will offer an express lane for shoppers buying five plants or less. Youth from the 4H Club will assist with loading purchases. Council members, identified by their red caps, will offer planting, growing and cooking advice.

372,Here's your county-by-county forecast as storms head to Central Florida,"ORLANDO, Fla. - With a risk of severe weather Friday in Central Florida, here's a county-by-county forecast.

There is a chance of some rotating storms that could lead to a couple of isolated tornadoes, with the greatest risk in Lake, Marion and Sumter counties.

In those counties, there could be up to 1.5 inches of rain and a few rotating storms.

Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties are expected to receive more than a half-inch of rain, with gusty winds. The tornado risk, however, is low.

Brevard, Flagler and Volusia counties are forecast to see about a half-inch of rain, with small hail possible. There's a small craft advisory and a gale warning in effect, too.

The high in Orlando will reach 86, with a 90% coverage of rain. The average high on this date is 83.

""There will be a chance for some lingering showers and storms into the night, but by 10 o’clock most of the storms will be pushing out of Central Florida,"" Bridges said.

384,"Face-eating suspect Austin Harrouff arranged to buy drugs before attack, texts show","MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. - A former Florida State University student accused of killing a Martin County couple and chewing the face of one of the victims arranged to buy hallucinogenic drugs in the days leading up the murders, according to text messages released to Local 10 News this week.

Austin Harrouff, now 22, of Jupiter, is set to go on trial in November on a number of charges, including first-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder.

Harrouff's attorneys have said he was ""suffering from a full-blown psychotic episode"" when he killed Michelle Mishcon Stevens and John Stevens in their garage Aug. 15, 2016. The victims' neighbor, Jeffrey Fisher, was injured in the attack.

The case attracted international attention because Harrouff was found hovering over John Stevens' body while biting and removing pieces of the victim's face with his teeth, Martin County sheriff's deputies said. He also made growling noises at deputies, prosecutors said.

The family of Michelle Mishcon Stevens is outraged that Harrouff's lawyers are portraying him as a young person with a mental illness who snapped. They said the texts show a clear pattern of drug use that they believe led to the murders.

Thousands of pages of cellphone records have been released by the State Attorney's Office in the case.

The records also include notes that Harrouff wrote to himself, as well as his internet search history.

Searches included ""how to know if your going crazy,"" ""apply to become an Illuminati member"" and ""exploding head syndrome.""

Just hours before the attack, Harrouff wrote: ""I wish to be normal just a normal guy. Not too nice not too mean. But I can still run because I can't be tamed.""

Sometime later he wrote: ""Centaur you are awoken. Don't let them kill you.""

In one exchange six days before the killings, Harrouff asked an unknown person for drugs.

""I don't need anymore weed but are the shrooms good?"" Harrouff wrote.

""Yeah, they're golden teacher, properly dried and cured,"" the person replied.

""How much would it take me to trip but not too bad?"" Harrouff asked.

The person said the mushrooms ""gave my friend solid materialized visuals and put him close to the edge of uncomfortable.""

""Alright sweet I'll take it,"" Harrouff wrote.

In another set of messages, Harrouff's friends speculated on the day of the killing in a group chat that drugs contributed to the violence.

""Maybe he did flacka,"" Davit Kis, referring to a street drug that has been known to cause violent and bizarre behavior in users.

Dylan Lemmon added, ""He was definitely on something.""

""He did do flacka,"" Kis said.

However, toxicology reports did not find Flacka in Harrouff's system after the attacks, his attorneys said.

He tested positive for alcohol and trace amounts of marijuana. After the attacks, Harrouff was severely injured when authorities believe he ingested household chemicals stored in the Stevenes' garage. The defense attorneys said that could explain the presence of alcohol in his system.

Authorities also tested for psilocybin, the hallucinogenic substance from mushrooms. While the test was negative, psilocybin leaves a user's system in about 12 hours. Because of search warrant procedures, the sample used in the toxicology test was taken about 24 hours after the attack.

""Dude he wasn't psycho it was the drugs,"" a person identified as Gleggy wrote in the group chat. ""He's famous now lol … He got what he wanted.""

386,'Moonshot' explores memories of the Great Space Race,"Robert Holladay (Photo: Special to the Democrat)

It has been 50 years this July since man first landed on the moon, and a wave of nostalgia about those days is sweeping the publishing world.

Just three of the books that have appeared recently include James Hanson’s biography of Neil Armstrong, ""First Man"" ( and the resulting movie), Robert Kurson’s ""Rocket Men"" about Apollo 8, and now Douglas Brinkley’s ""American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space.""

Douglas Brinkley is one of our most prominent public historians, and I don’t particularly mean that in a positive way. He has jumped around some in his career, from Tulane and now to Rice University, and as his dust jacket blurb says “serves on boards, at museums, at colleges, and for historical societies.”

I don’t like to criticize books in this column but there are aspects of ""American Moonshot"" that are problematic. The book covers roughly 20 years, from the development of the V-2 rocket in Nazi Germany by Werner von Braun and his Pennemunde scientists, to the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963, with a couple of short chapters at the end about what happened after Kennedy went to Dallas.

It is a hagiography really, about Kennedy and his obsession to beat the Russians to the moon, and with the exception of a couple of very slight references to his “attraction to women,” it may as well have been titled “St. John.”

American Moonshot (Photo: Special to the Democrat)

One of the positive things about ""American Moonshot"" — despite his own repeated assertions that von Braun was complicit in war crimes at the Mittelwerk factory where Germany built the V-2’s because of his awareness that slave labor was being used — is that it re-establishes him as the most important rocket scientist involved in the space program, although Brinkley is clearly grudging about it.

Beginning roughly in 1970, after Apollo 11, NASA began to realize the moral complications of having ex members of the Nazi party working on such a highly publicized project and began to shed them.

My father, who worked with von Braun for six years at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, always considered this a colossal mistake. Von Braun was moved first to NASA headquarters in Washington, and when he realized that his efforts to promote a voyage to Mars and other projects were not going anywhere as the Vietnam War and the Great Society ate up all the money, left NASA and joined the Fairchild Corporation where he died in 1977.

In the years since, there has been a concerted effort on the part of historians and popular culture to argue that the German scientists were really not that important to the space program (if you see 1983 movie adaptation of Tom Wolfe’s ""The Right Stuff,"" von Braun is never identified, just an unnamed German administrator who is a buffoon).

Brinkley absolutely explodes that by, among other things, pointing out that at the end of the World War II, the German rocket program was eight years ahead of the United States, and getting von Braun and his scientists erased the gap overnight.

You can almost hear Brinkley’s teeth grind as he describes the relationship between two morally compromised men — both absolutely indispensable to the success of the moon program — who happened to like each other a lot.

Indeed, to Kennedy, von Braun’s Nazi past was not a factor; von Braun was simply fighting for his country. Von Braun, for his part, was effusive about finding someone who shared his obsession with space flight and was willing to spend the money to do it, and they forged a genuine friendship.

Between the two of them, they sold the Great Space Race to the public.

Brinkley’s book is entertaining, even if it has the air of having been written in a hurry to get it out in time for the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 this summer.

As such, there are some errors in it that might slide past the general reader, but not past someone raised close to the space program as was I. For example, on Page 107 he states that the test pad for the Marshall Center’s rocket boosters “was on the Tennessee River, which flowed into the Atlantic Ocean.” Well, if you were raised in the southeast, you know that the Tennessee River flows into the Ohio River which flows into the Mississippi River, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico.

Then on Page 375 there is this: “Bob Gilruth, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center told the astronauts that there would be eleven or twelve manned Gemini flights…” Well, sorry again, but Bob Gilruth was director of the Houston Manned Space Flight Center created in 1961. Gilruth, for his part, thought von Braun was a prima donna. These are the kind of errors that a good fact checker or copy editor could have caught.

One way that the Great Space Race was sold to the American people was as an extension of the nation’s founding myth, the Frontier Myth, with its rugged individuals, vast expanses of space waiting to be conquered, etc. It was an analogy that lasted as late as 2000 when Clint Eastwood released a movie about the space program called, appropriately enough, ""Space Cowboys.""

Werner von Braun played an archetypal role in the space western, too, one that Brinkley reinforces: that of the flawed individual like Shane, Ethan Edwards or Tom Doniphon who, through his know-how or ruthlessness (or a combination of both) manages to make it possible to defeat the bad guys, but whose methods and past then render him an outcast from polite civilization. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.

388,Rain slowly moving in for derby weekend,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Saturday morning will be best to get things done outdoors this weekend. We're starting Saturday on a muggy note in the upper 60s and low 70s, according to News 6 meteorologist Samara Cokinos.

By Saturday afternoon, a few showers and thunderstorms will pop up and move toward the coast, but it's all about location!

Warm & muggy to start the weekend. Later today it will be hot and humid before thunderstorms start to pop up. Highs expected near 90 degrees. #news6 #ClickOrlando pic.twitter.com/bwKOFezmPE — Samara Cokinos (@CokinosSamaraWx) May 4, 2019

Not everyone will get the rain. In fact, northern zones such as Marion and Flagler County will be least active with an isolated shower or two possible. As you move south the coverage rises from 10 percent to 40 percent around Orlando and even more active in Brevard and Osceola, Cokinos said.

Most of the storms will pop up after 2 p.m. Saturday and linger along the Brevard County coast through 9 or 10 p.m.

Keep in mind with any passing storm that there could be heavy pockets of rain adding up to a couple inches of water on the ground pretty quickly.

Lightning and gusty winds are also possible.

Beachgoers will want to get their time on the sand in early. Swim safe and near a lifeguard with rip current risks at moderate levels, Cokinos urged.

Be ready to wrap things up anytime after 2 p.m. as storms move eastward toward the coast.

Overnight, it will be partly to mostly cloudy with most of the rain clearing out. Lows will stay mild and muggy in the low 70s.

""Tomorrow, (expect) another round of afternoon rain,"" Cokinos said. ""Some storms over northern zones like Marion and Flagler could turn severe, but will remain fairly isolated.""

Rain continues for the first half of the workweek along with highs in the upper 80s.

390,VIDEO: Hospital workers drop newborn baby in delivery room,"CHANDLER, Ariz. - A couple is still living with the horrific memory of seeing their newborn baby being dropped by a hospital employee just moments after their daugther was born.

Derrick and Monique Rodgers of Chandler, Arizona shared the shocking video on social media after receiving no apologies from officials at Chandler Regional Medical Center.

The Rodgers' twin girls were born prematurely on Valentine's Day. The video showed baby Morgan falling out of the hands of a doctor and onto a table before other nurses caught her before she fell off the table.

“I told him, ‘You dropped my baby,’” Derrick said, recalling the encounter to KNXV. “He had like a nonchalant look on his face. Then I showed him the video, and he had nothing to say after that.”

Morgan was found to have what amounts to a tiny hemorrage of the brain, which should not have any long term effects.

Other than the bleed, the Rodgers' say Morgan is doing fine but say she sometimes shakes and tenses up.

But the family still wants to hear some remorse from the hospital.

""You know, an apology when it happened could've gone a long way,"" said Monique.

Kernel the juvenile green sea turtle has returned to the ocean after swallowing a fishhook, then recuperating for months at Brevard Zoo.

The turtle was released Wednesday afternoon at Spessard Holland North Beach park, just south of Melbourne Beach.

Kernel was admitted to the zoo's Sea Turtle Healing Center on Jan. 19 — which is National Popcorn Day.

A couple had hooked the turtle while fishing, then alerted the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

The fishhook had to be surgically removed, and the ailing reptile was nursed back to health with antibiotics, fluids and nutritional support.

“Accidents happen, and you won’t get in any legal trouble for inadvertently hooking a sea turtle,"" Shanon Gann, sea turtle program manager, stated in a press release.

""If possible, don’t cut the line and use a net to safely guide the sea turtle to shore or onto your boat; in fact, many piers have nets available for this purpose. Do not reel the sea turtle in as this could deepen the wound,"" Gann stated.

“This is what the couple that hooked Kernel did, and that decision quite possibly saved Kernel’s life,” she stated.

To report a hooked sea turtle, call 888-404-FWCC.

According to the arrest report, an undercover deputy on assignment at the Inn Town Suite motel noticed Trisha Ann Jewell, 28, and Zachary Adam Harwell, 33, leaving the motel carrying bags to their car.

Moments after the two pulled out of the motel parking lot onto Blanding Boulevard just south of Middleburg, the deputy pulled them over on a seat belt violation.

Suspecting the couple had narcotics in the vehicle, the deputy had a K-9 officer come to the scene. According to the report, the dog alerted on a scent. The report said multiple illegal narcotics and drug paraphernalia were found during a search.

According to the narcotics deputy, the illegal drugs include:

Cocaine – 4 grams

Heroin/fentanyl mix – 2 grams

Dilaudid – 16 pills

Ecstasy pills – 3 pills

Methamphetamines – more than 200 grams

Ingredients to make meth

The deputy noted that five digital scales were also located in the car, along with other types of drug paraphernalia.

In addition to multiple drug charges, Harwell also faces an illegal weapons charge after the deputy reported finding a handgun in the car.

Harwell’s bond was set at more $775,000, while Jewell’s bond was set at $700,000..

Adam Ruiz’s suspension will start May 18 after an order from the Florida Supreme Court. He was admitted to the Florida Bar in 2000.

He was hired by a married couple to do immigration work in 2016, according to discipline documents. He was paid a $1,500 fee for representation.

Ruiz assured the couple that immigration paperwork was being completed and filed with the U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services division. Five months after meeting with Ruiz, the couple asked for a status update. They received no response for four months.

His services were terminated, and the couple asked for their file, an itemized closing bill and any unused portion of their retainer. Ruiz in his response said he not remember the couple making a request for their files.

Attempts to reach Ruiz through his paralegal were unsuccessful as was a letter sent to his office that was returned as “undeliverable.” Written inquiries from the Florida Bar’s Attorney Consumer Assistance Program were also returned “undeliverable.”

In a response to the complaint, an attorney representing Ruiz said familial and financial issues had arisen during the time he was representing the couple that resulted in several complaints being filed by them and other clients.

""Beginning in 2009 and continuing through today, the Respondent has undergone a series of traumatic and stressful events that resulted in a diagnosis of a Major Depressive Disorder,"" wrote Tallahassee attorney Edward Iturralde.

He noted a variety of issues, including martial problems and the foreclosure of Ruiz's home. Iturralde also said Ruiz, a dual citizen of Ecuador and a former Army Ranger, sustained a brutal beating in 2016 by a gang there while he was working for a family investigating the possible murder of their daughter in the Galapagos Islands.

397,"Tyler Florence, Food Network show 'Great Food Truck Race' filming in Florida (we think)","CLOSE Five food trucks that appear to be competing in the Food Network show ""The Great Food Truck Race"" fed hungry fans during a May 21-22 visit to Oxnard. Here's a look at their menus, at which ""Jersey Shore"" star is competing with his Mom's recipes -- and at where they're headed next.

Is Food Network's 'The Great Food Truck Race' shooting in Fort Myers this week? Few can say for sure, but signs point to yes.

Reporter's note: This story has been updated from its original version with new information on Madea Made, Frank n Slides and the Brunch Babes food trucks, and updates on the schedules Wednesday and Thursday.

All signs point to ""The Great Food Truck Race"" rolling through the Fort Myers area this week.

Even if nobody can technically confirm it.

Sign 1: Tyler Florence, the celebrity chef who hosts the Food Network reality competition, popped into Bennett's Fresh Roast in downtown Fort Myers on Wednesday morning for a couple dozen doughnuts and a quadruple shot of espresso (clearly he had a LOT of work ahead of him).

Sign 2: A handful of national food trucks have been calling local breweries trying to secure last-minute spots at their venues.

According to posts on Facebook, Fort Myers Brewing Co. in Gateway is hosting a ""National Food Truck Competition"" from 2-7 p.m. Wednesday, April 24, and 10:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Thursday, April 25, featuring the NOLA Creations 504 food truck, which looks to be scheduled for both days, as well as the Rolling Indulgence and Brunch Babes food trucks on Wednesday.

Millennial Brewing Co. in Fort Myers also has an event from 10:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Thursday featuring Rolling Indulgence, which it called a ""National Food Truck Competition Contestant"" from Dayton, Ohio.

Late Tuesday, Old Soul Brewing in Fort Myers announced it would be hosting Frank n Slides food truck Wednesday from 10:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday for a ""reality show food truck competition.""

Wednesday morning, the local Jonesez BBQ food truck announced that Madea Made would be joining it Wednesday and Thursday for a ""Food Truck Family Day"" at the corner of Crystal Drive and Metro Parkway in south Fort Myers.

Brunch Babes posted on Instagram that it would also be in Fort Myers, taking part in Fort Myers Brewing's event Wednesday, and also serving at Sidney & Berne Davis Art Center from 10 a.m. through lunchtime Thursday. Past posts show the truck in Myrtle Beach and Hilton Head, South Carolina, as well as Daytona Beach and, just last week, Tampa. They also note that it is ""competing in a #foodcompetition with other #foodtrucks.""

""I can't say much,"" Fort Myers Brewing's owner Jen Gratz-Whyte said. ""It's all still coming together. What we put on Facebook is pretty much the extent of what we're allowed to say.""

Kyle Cebull, owner of Millennial, was equally evasive. After a bit of prodding, he offered this:

""I mean, I can say that, you know, we’re very excited that we’re going to get to be a part of this traveling event. We host food trucks all the time, but this is definitely going to be a unique experience with a truck from out of the area.""

If blog posts and recent media coverage are any indication, then the Food Network reality show seems to have made its way down the East Coast of the U.S. in recent weeks.

A February article from seacoastonline.com put Florence and ""The Great Food Truck Race"" in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In March, providencejournal.com had the show in Middletown, Rhode Island. Earlier this month, wmbfnews.com said the series was indeed in Myrtle Beach.

The show's ninth season aired in August and was shot out west, where Florence welcomed ""seven teams of brand new food truck operators as they embark(ed) on the adventure of a lifetime,"" a Food Network page noted.

The trucks compete for sales in various towns, with the worst-performing truck booted from the competition at the end of each show. The final two trucks then compete head to head in the finale for $50,000 in prize money.

So, is the show really here?

Sign 3 is a doozy: Bob Grissinger, owner of Bennett's (possibly Florence's new favorite doughnut and espresso spot), says yes. The doughnut maker seems ""not"" to be under the same gag orders imposed on the breweries. In a post to Bennett's Facebook page, Grissinger said Florence was in town this morning, ""shooting (an) episode of his series The Great Food Truck Race,"" adding, ""Happy shooting guys. Enjoy our wonderful town!""

Although Food Network officials haven't responded to a request for comment, the signs are all here.

398,"Wildfire season starts slow in Florida, but concern grows about Panhandle communities","CLOSE Raw video from the Allanton Road wildfire in Bay County, which burned 669 acres in March 2017. Kevin Elliott, Special to USA Today Network - Florida

There was a knock on Kevin Elliott's front door the last Saturday in March. It was his neighbor, there to tell him a fire was burning in the woods behind his house.

Six months earlier, Elliott's home in eastern Bay County survived Hurricane Michael's 150 mph winds. But the storm left 72 million tons of downed trees in its wake, the state said, and turned the woods behind Elliott's house into a tinderbox ready to erupt.

The fire behind Elliott's home was started by a neighbor burning yard trash, Florida Forest Service records show.

Normally, a fire like that would have taken a few hours to contain, said Jim Karels, director of the Florida Forest Service. But with all of the fire fuels on the ground, it took days to control and ended up burning 669 acres.

With Florida entering its peak wildfire season, fire officials are especially concerned about more fires breaking out in the areas hit hardest by the hurricane.

“Michael just ravaged the forest of the Panhandle,” Karels said. “If we have a normal fire season, with those fuels, it could be catastrophic.”

But while fire officials keep a cautious eye on Northwest Florida, for most of the rest of the state the wildfire season has arrived not with a roar but with a whimper.

Consistent rain over the winter and early spring has led to the slowest start to wildfire season in over a decade, data from the Florida Forest Service shows.

Florida firefighters battled 450 wildfires on state land through March 31, the fewest over the first three months of a year in more than a decade, according to a Naples Daily News and News-Press analysis of state wildfire data going back to 2008.

The next slowest start to the fire season was 2014, when 566 wildfires burned on state land over the first three months.

Graphic by Janie Haseman / Naples Daily News

This year’s 450 fires burned 7,228 acres, the smallest number of acres burned in that period since 2015, when 622 fires burned 5,595 acres through the first three months of the year. Most of this year's fires were small, an acre or less.

The slow start to fire season is a good thing, Karels said, but it may not continue. The coming months are typically the busiest of the year for big, dangerous fires.

“This time of year is the time you don’t let your guard down,” he said.

Elliott, 44, said he is concerned about his eastern Bay County neighbors, who are already emotionally wrecked from the storm. While the March fire burned most of the fuel behind his house, there are still plenty of places at risk.

""It happened to us. It's not unlikely that it will happen again,"" he said of the wildfire. ""All of the eastern side of the county is in the same situation.""

Consistent rain has kept Florida wet

Florida hasn’t had a particularly wet winter or spring. Rainfall levels in the state have been within about 2 inches of average, said Robert Molleda with the National Weather Service in Miami.

But the rain has been consistent enough to keep the state from seeing drought-like conditions that would spark an active wildfire season.

“We haven’t had one of these years where it’s been dry with virtually no rain for three or four weeks at a time,” Molleda said. “We’ve had weather systems fairly periodic, once a week or so, that’s brought rainfall across the area.”

He warned, though, that dry conditions and higher temperatures could change the landscape before the rainy season begins. April and the first two weeks of May are among the hottest times of the year in terms of daily high temperatures.

“Even though the dry season has been not extremely dry or extremely wet, it’s usually the last month of the season that can be particularly dangerous with wildfires because the temperatures are increasing and we have a lingering dry air from the end of the dry season,” Molleda said.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is calling for above-average chances of above-average temperatures but also above-average chances of above-average rain between now and June.

This year’s quiet start to wildfire season stands in stark contrast to 2018 and 2017, which had two of the busiest starts to fire seasons of the last decade, the state data shows.

Through the first three months of 2017, firefighters battled 1,223 fires that burned 52,535 acres of state land. Last year through March, there were 1,094 fires that burned 68,302 acres of state land.

Todd Waldeck, 58, is still rebuilding after a March 2017 fire burned down his family’s home in the forest east of Naples.

Waldeck, who was unable to find a builder with the insurance money he received for his under-insured home, decided last year to rebuild the house himself. He now spends most of his days alone in the woods, laying blocks and framing walls.

“We can’t afford to do it any other way,” he said.

Man-made fires in March, lightning fires later

The biggest wildfire on state land so far in 2019 erupted in mid-January on the western bank of Lake Okeechobee.

The fire – deemed arson after investigators found several small ignition points in the same area – initially burned about 300 acres in the dried out marshes. Because it burned in a mucky area where its difficult to bring bulldozers and equipment, firefighters conducted a 1,500-acre burn out operation to consume the fuel around the fire.

“We kind of accelerate the natural burning process,” said Melissa Yunas, a Florida Forest Service wildfire mitigation specialist in the state’s Okeechobee District. “If it would have burned naturally, it would have burned for a couple of weeks and up to a month.”

There were 199 wildfires in March, the busiest month of the year so far. In fact, March often is the busiest month in terms of the total quantity of fires.

From 2008 through 2018, there were more wildfires in March – 4,808 – than in any other calendar month, according to Florida Forest Service data. Typically, those fires are man-made, caused by people burning yard debris, out of control campfires, kids playing with fire and arson, data show.

Through March, 171 of the state’s 450 wildfires were caused by debris burning, making it the leading cause of fires in the state this year, followed by 112 intentionally set incendiary fires, or arson.

In early March, firefighters had to conduct a 590-acre burnout in Osceola County, after a trash fire near the Brevard County line escaped a barrel.

A couple of weeks later, a 2-acre fire in Highlands County destroyed a travel trailer where a man was living and killed the man's dogs, Yunas said. That fire also was started by a resident burning yard waste.

“Whether it’s a small fire or a large fire, it can still be devastating,” Yunas said.

Karels said people burning trash or yard debris need to be sure they have the proper setbacks and water on hand, and should check with their fire department about any local burn bans. People who start fires, even inadvertently, could face costly fire suppression costs and could end up in court, he said.

The state’s biggest fires typically ignite in May and June, which are typically among the driest months of the year. State data show the most common cause of fires in May and June is lightning strikes, which pick up when the rainy season kicks in, but often before the landscape is sufficiently wet.

“Lightning loves to put them strikes down in the middle of nowhere,” Karels said. “It gives that fire the ability to gain strength before we can get there.”

The next few months are typically the peak of fire season, and Karels said he doesn’t expect this year to be any different.

The National Interagency Fire Center, a Idaho-based wildland firefighting support center, is calling for normal wildfire potential in Florida through June.

“I don’t think we’re going to go into any extreme drought. They’re not forecasting that at all,” Karels said. “However, with those fuels we have, we don’t need extreme drought right now.”

“It won’t take much drying, a couple two to three days, and you have the potential for fire to run again.”

The Garnet team had hot dogs as their meal.

The Gold team also took the time to poke fun at the Garnet team and it wasn't just reserved to the players.

FSU wide receivers coach Ron Dugans -- the head coach of the Gold team -- posted a video on Twitter poking fun at a couple Garnet players before turning his attention to defensive coordinator Harlon Barnett and linebackers coach Raymond Woodie.

410,"Students, beware of Gaines Street parking perils |Street Scene","Retired state trooper Philip Stuart. (Photo: Philip Stuart)

Dear John E. Thrasher, President Florida State University: Please post this Driver Safety message to reach as many FSU drivers as possible. Students, when you find yourself driving along Gaines Street through College Town, take it slow. Angle parking in one area creates unexpected stopping in the thru lane of traffic.

The vehicle is stopped so the driver can back into an available angle parking space. A little farther east a driver may be backing out of the angle parking in front of Greenwise market.

So, proud students of Florida State University, please understand you are responsible adults now. Your destiny is in your hands, not only in your method of study but also as you operate a motor vehicle. Consider this stretch of Gaines Street a congested area of your busy downtown at home. Being in a hurry on this stretch of road can be particularly hazardous.

Q. Don writes with this latest and interesting LED streetlight snafu. Living on a cul-de-sac at the end of his residential street the newly installed LED luminaries bring a blinding brilliant light into the front of his home and onto his driveway but leaves the cul-de-sac in the dark.

A. Well Don, this is a new twist, however, sad to say, not a new LED streetlight complaint. Please give me a utility pole number or street address. This type of thing only leads to the belief city management has no interest in the welfare of our citizens. The blame doesn’t only fall to the utility employees, they follow the lead of division directors and ultimately the ones we elected to look after our best public safety interest.

Q. Writing first in 2017, Matthew is appreciated for his Street Scene contributions and for being quite astute to Tallahassee traffic high points and woes. His most recent observation is drivers hindering thru traffic at drive-in restaurants. This day it is the Chic-fil-A traffic on Apalachee Parkway at Paul Russell Road. Apparently some eastbound to northbound drivers are so intent on a good place at the drive-up-window they occasionally allow their cars to jut into the westbound Apalachee Parkway thru lane. Which surely creates consternation for westbound drivers unable to move on the green light.

A. A driver of a vehicle blocking an intersection or a thru traffic-way is in violation of Florida Statute 316.1945 and subject to citation. Drive anywhere in Tallahassee or anywhere Florida, heck anywhere in the country and you will eventually come upon someone who has misjudged his/ her available gap in traffic enough to be unable to clear an intersection or traffic lane before the light changes. Other ""stopped in traffic lane""’ problems occur as described above in College Town.

As a State Trooper I was not a prolific ticket writer, where possible I looked at any extenuating condition that might explain how a driver found himself/ herself in a given situation. That’s not to say I didn’t exact duly earned credit for blatant law violations. I did indeed. Drive impaired or in a willful and wanton manner and I know you are asking to be taken from your car before you kill somebody. When operating a motor vehicle it is necessary to expect any traffic condition to materialize. Such as a road work crew or a city bus collecting/ dispensing riders to temporarily close a lane of traffic.

Q. Dan received a traffic citation for running a red light issued by a motorcycle police officer waiting in traffic about 3 cars back on the side street. Dan was polite interacting with the policeman but really wanted to ask how the officer knew Dan's light was red since it had just turned red prior him entering the intersection.

A. Well Dan a couple of things come to mind. If your ticket was issued during nighttime the light color is visible to the officer. If it was daylight the officer knows if he is looking at a green light, a red light is facing you.

In a hurry, tired and distracted

A major airline Boing 717 flight crew, pilot and copilot, were awakened early one morning for a hurry-up, unscheduled flight to take a 717 to another airport. Arriving very early when no ground crews were at the airport the two had to back the 100 seat passenger liner away from the gate themselves.

With little sleep and a ""get a move on"" from their dispatcher the pilots decided to use the engine reverse thrusters (a noisy fuel guzzling way of putting the airplane in reverse) to back away from the gate. Over the thundering jet engines they heard a loud clanking sound alerting them a tug-bar was attached to the nose wheel.

Being in a rush, not enough sleep, and distracted can render the best educated, best trained, highly-rated professionals sloppy at the task at hand. The same goes for us all. We must be certain we are never in a hurry, sleep deprived, distracted or otherwise impaired when we decide to get in our car and drive away.

With responsibility comes accountability, and there is no one more responsible than the operator of a motor vehicle.

The father of a Deltona teenager who was allegedly beaten up by a man and woman as she walked her siblings home from school is outraged.According to officials, the couple said one of Chris's younger children had bullied their child and that's why they attacked Chris's daughter.The teenager's father, Chris, said he got a frantic call from his 17-year-old daughter Wednesday, telling him a man and woman had stopped their car in front of her and her siblings as she walked them home from Forest Lake Elementary.WESH 2 News is not fully identifying the father for privacy purposes.He said she told him the couple was shouting at them. The teen said the suspects, Christopher McCullon and Rachel Probeck, then got out of the car and attacked her.""There's no reasons for you to ever put your hands on a minor. You know, my daughter? She didn't deserve that. You know, the siblings? They didn't deserve to watch their sister beat,"" Chris said.According to sheriff's investigators, the suspects believed one of the younger children was bullying their child. During the confrontation, the 17-year-old told deputies the pair singled her out, first spitting on her, then punching her in the face, pushing her down and kicking her in the ribs. ""It just makes me mad. It makes me real mad,"" Chris said. ""They should have come to us. There's other ways of handling the situation.""McCullon and Probeck have bonded out of jail for their charges of child abuse and battery.The pair were identified because a witness got the license plate number of their car after the incident.According to the report, they allege the 17-year-old was the aggressor, but witnesses back up the teen's story. The girl suffered several cuts and bruises during the ordeal.""They took it upon themselves to attack my daughter, and that's not right. That's not right.

All around Dr. Celina Moore’s office are pictures of children, just a fraction of who has been helped by the pediatrician in Boca Raton.But it’s the children she met about a year ago that changed her life.“It was wonderful,” Moore said. “It was wonderful just to be able to take what I do here and taking it some place where you can really make a difference.”That “some place” was the African country of Ghana.Moore was there on a two week medical mission, providing care for hundreds of people each day.That’s when a local kindergarten teacher named Rita approached her.“She asked me if I could build a school,” Moore recalled. “So I said, ‘I don’t know how to build a school but Steve can build a school.”Steve is Moore’s partner, Steve Simpson.He was also in Ghana with her.Together, the couple went and looked at Rita’s school.“Her classroom was four sticks in the ground with a thatched roof,” Moore said. “There’s no walls! There’s nothing!” said Simpson. “It’s all exposed.”“Every time it rains, they have to leave that classroom because there are no walls and the children get wet,” Moore said.It was at that moment they decided to help.Now, a year later, after using their own money and their own ingenuity, the project is almost complete.The children in this small village in Ghana almost have their new school.“Just the light in their eyes,” Moore said about the children. “And knowing that in that part of the world, education can mean so much, especially education of girls.”“It’s like an overwhelming flow of energy that just knocks me off my feet all the time,” said Simpson, describing the emotions of helping the children.Then, with tears in her eyes, Moore summed up why they have put so much time and effort into building the school.“The more love you put out there, the more there is,” she said.Once the school is complete, Moore and Simpson said they want to start building a bathroom for the school.There’s no running water in that area so they know it’s going to be a challenging project.If you’d like to help them, you can donate to their efforts here.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/local-doctor-brings-education-to-small-african-village/27351076,2019-05-03T03:37:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
417,Thieves targeting boat motors in Lake County,"CLERMONT, Fla. - Surveillance video shows a boat being stolen in a Lake County neighborhood Wednesday morning, only to turn up hours away with its motors missing.

Murray Tucker wasn't surprised when he learned about it, because his family had their boat stolen from their barn about a month ago.

""It was like I was punched in the stomach,"" he said. ""We've had that boat for a long time. We've only had the engines a couple weeks, got to run the boat one time, and put six hours on them.""

His boat turned up about a quarter mile away from where it went messing, also with the motors removed.

Experts said these boat motor thefts aren't just happening here in Central Florida; they're happening all over the state.

Capt. Johnny Martinez owns a boat restoration business in Winter Garden, and has seen more and more of his customers coming in and dealing with this issue.

""The magnitude of this epidemic, it's out of control,"" he said. ""The engines stolen have been in the $6,000 range all the way up to $30,000 to $50,000 per engine.""

Martinez now suggests to his customers that they invest in GPA tracking in all important equipment, as well as cameras.

Several Facebook groups have also been formed to spread the word about stolen boats and motors, in an effort to raise awareness:

- Florida Stolen Boats, Motors, Trailers & Electronics

- South Florida Marina & Boat Watch Group

- Stolen Boats Motors Florida

How much would you pay to fly in space?Make up your mind, because the very first tourist flights could come this year. A Central Florida rocket company completed an important test flight Thursday that could pave the way for tourist launches from Texas.The landing of the window-studded spaceship in the West Texas scrub was perfect.""Over the next couple of months, toward the end of this year, we are going to be flying humans on top of this rocket,"" Ariane Cornell, with Blue Origin, said.

419,Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas got married in Las Vegas after the Billboard Music Awards,"Advertisement Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas got married in Las Vegas after the Billboard Music Awards Couple married in quick Vegas chapel ceremony Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner went and got married Wednesday night in Las Vegas after the Billboard Music Awards. The two had a quickie wedding at a wedding chapel presided by an Elvis impersonator. Diplo shared a livestream of their ceremony on his Instagram Story. There was a dog filter used; ring pops were exchanged, but the couple had family with them. Jonas was in a suit while Turner had a traditional white dress and veil on.Entertainment Tonight confirmed the wedding was legitimate with a copy of Sophie and Joe's marriage license that they obtained earlier in the day. The two had been rumored to be getting married in France, and Joe had said on James Corden's show earlier this year that their wedding is going to be in the summer. You can check out some more videos from attendees here, but they do contain strong language. Shortly before he married Sophie, Joe performed with the Jonas Brothers during the Billboard Music Awards' show in the city. All the boys' significant others were with them: Nick Jonas' wife, Priyanka Chopra, and Kevin Jonas' wife, Danielle Jonas. While Sophie and Joe didn't walk the red carpet together (she walked with her ""X-Men"" co-stars), they did cozy up during the broadcast.Ahead of the show, Joe confirmed on Instagram that Sophie would be sitting next to him by sharing a video of him talking to her seat place card. ""So where you from? Sweet, yeah, I love the U.K. It's so beautiful. You uh, heard of the Jonas Brothers? No? Okay..."" he joked in the clip. Sophie and Joe were last out together for the New York City ""Game of Thrones"" premiere. There, Sophie wore a black Louis Vuitton mini dress. Joe matched her in a gray and black suit. Joe had talked about what he didn't want his wedding to be like after attending both his brothers'. Joe was asked by James Corden what he learned from watching his brothers' nuptials. "" mostly things not to do,"" he said. ""They were both absolutely beautiful. All 18 of Nick’s were amazing,"" he prefaced with a smirk.

420,"System in tropics to bring rain, storms to Orlando area","ORLANDO, Fla. - A weather system being tracked by the National Hurricane Center will bring rain to Central Florida over the next couple of days.

""A trough of low pressure located over the northwestern Bahamas is producing disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity,"" News 6 meteorologist Troy Bridges said. ""Little development is expected as the system moves northwest or toward Florida.""

The hurricane center is giving the system a 0% chance of development over the next few days and a 20% chance of development over the next five days.

""Regardless of development, heavy rain will be possible as the system moves into Florida,"" Bridges said. ""There's no real threat of severe weather.""

By the time it tries to get organized, it will likely be off the coast of the Carolinas, heading back out to sea.

Expect a 70% coverage of rain in Orlando on Thursday, with scattered off and on showers and thunderstorms.

Orlando will reach a high of 86, which is the average high on this date.

421,Lawmakers back homeowner vegetable gardens,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - The Florida House on Wednesday gave final approval to a measure that would prevent local governments from regulating homeowners’ vegetable gardens.

The 93-16 vote will send the bill (SB 82) to Gov. Ron DeSantis. The issue stems from a dispute between homeowners Hermine Ricketts and Laurence Carroll and the village of Miami Shores over an ordinance that banned front-yard vegetable gardens.

The couple had maintained a front-yard garden for nearly two decades but uprooted their vegetables when faced with the possibility of fines. They challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance but lost in court, with the Florida Supreme Court last year declining to take up the issue.

House bill sponsor Elizabeth Fetterhoff, R-DeLand, said Wednesday the legislation involves fundamental rights and that government has “no business” telling Floridians they can’t grow their own food, no matter where they live.

“Although simple in nature, this is a very important bill,” Fetterhoff said.

The bill, sponsored in the Senate by Appropriations Chairman Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, cleared the Senate in a 35-5 vote on March 21.

422,"Husband kills wife, then himself in what family calls 'mercy shooting'","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The sister of a man who killed his wife and then himself in a San Souci home Wednesday night said he did it because he couldn't stand to see his wife suffer any longer.

Officers found the couple dead in their home on Goltare Drive about 3:30 p.m. when a man called 911 to report that he had shot his wife and was prepared to take his own life.

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office won't identify the victims, but family members said John and Gwendolyn Thombleson died in the home. The husband's sister said after the wife had surgery eight months ago, her health began declining rapidly and she developed several health conditions, including dementia.

The medical bills were piling up, and neighbors told News4Jax that John Thombleson had said their insurance was expiring, leaving them no way to pay for the mounting expenses.

According to police, officers sent to the home made numerous attempts to contact the people inside but the attempts were unsuccessful.

Eventually, members of the SWAT team entered the home, finding the man and woman in a bedroom.

The couple were high school sweethearts and had been married 47 years. John Thombleson was retired and Gwendolyn Thombleson worked for the school district.

This was not a domestic dispute, according to the family. They said they tried to help as much as they could during the time when the wife's health was deteriorating.

Family members called this a mercy killing and said that John Thombleson was motivated by his love for his wife.

The neighbor who lives across the street said the last time he spoke with John Thombleson, the conversation was about the couple potentially losing their home because of their mounting medical bills.

Drazen Klacer, another neighbor, said he never noticed any red flags.

“He was nice guy, older guy, ready to retire,"" Klacer said.

Lisa Veres, a third neighbor, was shocked to hear about what happened.

""You don’t hear of anything like this happening in this neighborhood,"" Veres said. ""We’ve lived here for so long and my husband’s family has lived here for so long, and everybody is just so quiet and so sweet.""

The family is planning the funeral arrangements.

429,Public meetings set for possible F-22 'bed-down' at Eglin,"EGLIN AFB — A series of public meetings on the ""bed-down"" of maintenance and pilot training for the F-22 Raptor fighter jet at either Eglin Air Force Base or Virginia's Langley Air Force Base are scheduled for this area in the coming days.

The sessions, part of preparation of required Environmental Impact Statements at both Eglin and Langley for the F-22 operations, are scheduled for 5-8 p.m. May 14-16, according to an Air Force announcement. The May 14 meeting is at Cornerstone Worship Center, 444 Valparaiso Parkway in Valparaiso; the May 15 session will be in rooms 132/133 of Building 400 at Northwest Florida State College, 100 E. College Blvd. in Niceville, and the May 16 meeting will be held in the Student Union East Conference Room of Gulf Coast State College, 5230 U.S. Highway 98 in Panama City.

The Air Force already has identified Langley as its preferred site for the F-22 FTU (Formal Training Unit) for the jet's pilots and maintenance personnel. The FTU had previously been located at Panama City's Tyndall AFB. But those responsibilities, along with associated aircraft and personnel, were moved to Eglin after Hurricane Michael leveled the Panama City base when it roared ashore in October as a Category 5 storm.

The transfer of the 43rd Fighter Squadron brought 31 Raptors, 18 T-38 Talons (jets to train F-22 pilots in aerial combat) and hundreds of Air Force personnel to Eglin, where they have been operating from the 33rd Fighter Wing flightline.

The F-22 FTU is at Eglin now under a temporary federal bed-down agreement. That agreement, reached quickly in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael, identified noise as the only environmental impact of the additional aircraft at Eglin. The environmental assessments now under way for Eglin and Langley will be far more detailed, and could take at least a couple of years. A site survey also is required at Langley in advance of any final decision on the F-22 FTU.

The upcoming meetings will include a half-hour presentation from the Air Force, bracketed by time for the public to learn informally about the environmental impact assessment, and to submit comments about the proposed changes for the F-22's FTU. Public comments may also be submitted via email at 633CES.CEIE.NEPAPublicComment@us.af.mil, by phone at (757) 276-8556 or by mail at ATTN: 5th GEN FTU EIS, 2261 Hughes Ave., Suite 155; JBSA Lackland, TX 78236-9835. Comments can also be submitted at the website https://www.leidoseemg.com/5GenFTUEIS.

With a decision on the F-22 Formal Training Unit at least months away, local officials nonetheless seem to recognize that the unit likely will go to Langley, which already hosts two F-22 squadrons, and is designed to host three squadrons.

Even Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., whose district includes Eglin, is resigned to the possibility that Eglin will lose its inherited F-22 operations.

After Hurricane Michael, Gaetz made the case to Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan that Eglin was the best place to temporarily relocate Tyndall's F-22 operations. But, Gaetz said Wednesday, when talk turned to a permanent basing solution, Shanahan told him ""that Langley represented a lower MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations) cost given their existing F-22 mission.""

Still, Gaetz is disappointed the F-22 FTU is likely bound for Langley.

""I don't love it,"" he said, ""but the Acting Secretary shared a reason for the decision.""

Another area congressman, Republican Rep. Neal Dunn, whose district includes Tyndall, has already bid farewell to the F-22s. In late March, as the Air Force indicated Langley was the preferred choice for the F-22 training unit, Dunn issued a statement reading, in part, ""These squadrons were a great part of our community for years, and will continue to make America great at their new home.""

Dunn's statement was tempered by Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson's December announcement that Tyndall would be rebuilt as the home of three F-35 squadrons, a move that would bring 72 of the fighter jets to Tyndall by 2023.

""We look forward to bedding down more combat aircraft than ever before at the new and improved Tyndall Air Force Base,"" Dunn said in March.

The Economic Development Council of Okaloosa County weighed in on the likely move of F-22 operations from Eglin to Langley with a brief statement from retired Air Force Lt. Col. Robert Marinan, chairman of the council's Defense Support Initiatives Committee.

“The future basing of the F-22 is a complex issue with a host of factors that must be considered,"" Marinan said in an email. ""The Defense Support Initiatives Committee stands ready to support the long-term strategic direction of Eglin leadership and the United States Air Force.”

Meanwhile, the state of Virginia is already welcoming the F-22 unit. In a recent editorial, the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted, ""The base is well prepared to handle the new addition. ... While impact studies and other red tape issues could delay the unit’s arrival for a year or longer, we’re happy to welcome the 43rd Fighter Squadron to Virginia. The Air Force chose well.""",https://www.thedestinlog.com/news/20190505/public-meetings-set-for-possible-f-22-bed-down-at-eglin?rssfeed=true,2019-05-05T12:07:34Z,The Destin Log,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
430,It's better to be interested than interesting | Quint Studer,"Am I interested or interesting? This is a question that every leader (in fact, every person) needs to ask themselves. When we come across as interested in others rather than trying to be interesting to them, there’s a better chance they’ll like and trust us. This is a huge part of engaging people and creating strong relationships both in and out of the workplace.

A few weeks back, I received an email from a woman named Becca Smith who shared that she recalls a talk I gave on this topic. Becca and I worked together years ago, and she and her family now live in Texas. She told me she found this talk helpful at the time and wondered if I had anything written on the subject I could send her. I looked and could not find anything, so I decided to write a column about interested vs. interesting.

Being interested in others may sound simple, but it’s a lot harder than one might think. As I sat down to think about it, I realized there are actually three parts to this equation. One is overcoming the natural urge to try to be interesting. (That’s this week’s column.) The second part — which will come next week — is developing the skill of being interested, which centers on asking good questions. Finally, two weeks from now, we will zero-in on listening, which is a vital part of showing people you’re interested.

Humble leadership: What does humble leadership look like in action?

EAP services: Why EAP services are important — and how to help employees use them

Quint Studer (Photo: Special to the News Journal)

Being interested gets people to open up, which paves the way to an authentic connection. It gets us beyond arm’s length and creates the kind of relationship that makes people want to sign on as clients or buy from us or partner with us. It helps us build the kind of strong relationships with employees that inspire them to do their best work. It helps us create loyal customers. It’s an awesome business skill.

Yes, we also need to have the right leadership and technical skills — and our company’s products and service have to have the right price and a good level of quality — but all of these are just the price of entry. In the end, we do business with people we like. Ask yourself whom you enjoy being around the most: the person who is interested or interesting?

I struggle with being interested myself. Many do. It’s natural to want to hear our own voices and tell our own stories. A lot of this has to do with the signals we get all our lives. We are taught that to be leaders we need to come across as experts, always sharing advice and giving feedback. Being interested in and listening to others isn’t always emphasized. But it’s what gets results.

For years I would spend three or four nights a week in a hotel. I would flip on the TV and channel surf. Many times, I was just looking for some show to watch without requiring deep thinking, which gives me a headache. Anyway, years ago I came across a show called ""Blind Date."" It would match up two adults who would go out on an evening date and follow that up with a full-day date. At the end of the show, each person would be interviewed about their experience. Then the question would be asked, “Do you want to go out with this person again?”

Sometimes both would say yes or both would say no. Other times one would say yes, and one would say no. The person who said yes was always surprised when the other said no, for their perception was that the date had gone well. I noticed those who spent the most time being interested were much more likely to get a yes versus those who spent more time trying to be interesting. The person trying to be interesting spent most of the time talking about themselves instead of listening and asking questions. Those who were interested often used appreciative inquiry, meaning they were able to ask questions in a positive, insightful, interesting manner.

I know firsthand it can be tough to resist the urge to be interesting. In particular, being a good listener is hard for me. Every report card I ever received had checkmarks by “Needs improvement in listening.” This can come across as lack of respect. It is a characteristic I must work on constantly.

The first step is to get really intentional about being interested. Just being aware of our natural tendency to try to be interesting is a huge part of the battle. Then we can take steps to change this. In my case, I have found there are some simple tools and techniques that help me to do a better job of being interested. Here are some that work for me:

• At the top of an agenda for a meeting, I write myself a note to be quiet. (OK, it actually reads, “Quint, keep your big mouth shut.”)

• After a conversation, I ask myself, Do I know more about the other person or do they know more about me? If I know more about the other person, the conversation was a success.

• I write down the names of the attendees of meetings (including my own). When someone speaks, I put a checkmark by their name. This helps me hold up the mirror so I will listen more and talk less.

• Wait. Let others weigh in first. Many times, I find the point I wanted to make or information I wanted to share is said by someone else.

• Ask questions before sharing information about self or company. When you’re in a meeting, it’s a natural urge to talk about your company’s product or value. Plus, we’re often trained to do this. Before speaking, pause to shift your focus to the other person. If waiting on a customer, take time to gauge what their needs are. Why are they in the store? Even if you feel it is obvious, ask anyway. Sure, a couple coming into a restaurant wants to eat. However, maybe it’s because it is the place they had their first date, or they are craving something on the menu, or someone recommended it.

• Do the same in the workplace. This past week, it was time for me to meet with Crissy Nettles, the newly hired manager of the bookstore that will be opening in Southtowne. My role was to share with her the history of the Studer Family of Companies. Becca’s email had reminded me to be interested more than interesting, so I started by asking Crissy about herself. I learned about her parents, where she grew up, received her undergraduate degree, her overseas experience in her course of study, her master’s degree, how she met her husband, her children, her experience of owning a bookstore in Monroeville, Alabama, her family’s move here, where she worked before accepting the bookstore job, and her first impressions of whether we are walking the talk.

I found our conversation interesting and I learned things that I feel will help me know more about bookstores and how I can be helpful. Without “being interested” being top of mind, I wouldn’t have handled our time together this way. That would have been a shame, because I feel it got our relationship off on the right foot. The saying “Nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care” comes to mind here. (We will talk more about the power of asking great questions next week.)

• Look for ways to build tactics showing you are interested into the workplace. In past columns, I’ve described such techniques as rounding on employees and customers, utilizing peers in the hiring of new staff, sending thank-you notes, and calling customers to see how they are doing. Each one shows interest. (Again, we will cover these in more detail in next week’s column.)

• Work hard to hone your listening skills. Along with asking questions, great listening is a cornerstone of being interested. (We’ll cover the fundamentals of great listening in two weeks.)

• Working to become more interested can lead to great enlightenment about others and one’s self. Also, it completely changes the way they see you. And it takes a lot of pressure off—once you realize that you don’t have to keep trying to prove you’re the smartest person in the room, it’s amazing how much you’ll enjoy connecting with the people around you, and how much you’ll learn in the process.

Columnist note: This column was updated from the print version to include information provided from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

Last Sunday morning was truly a sabbath designed by God. One of those work-of-art Sundays where the the sky is so clear and the sun is so warm and outside world is so glorious that it demands dropping the -g off of ""morning"" when you pronounce the word. I’m talkin’ about a good mornin’!

With gospel music on the radio and kayaks strapped into the back of the pickup truck, my adorable wife and I spun off I-10, westbound onto Nine Mile Road en route to the Perdido River. As we rolled past the sprawling and seemingly ever-evolving campus of Navy Federal we rolled down the window to suck in some sunshine.

And instead, we inhaled odor. The odor. International Paper odor — that thick, spongy gas that coats your tongue and somehow smells and tastes yellow. It's the official government-sanctioned odor of Escambia County, don't you know!

There it was — a miraculous made-by-the-Lord morning sullied by a made-by-man odor.

And there we were, driving past Navy Federal, the most dynamic job-creator in Pensacola, a forward-thinking, full-steam-ahead seeker of talent with the potential for an entire community to spring up around it — a soon-to-be-employer of 10,000 people — and its airspace is tainted by the stench from a decades-old paper mill that produces about 400 jobs seven miles to the north.

There it was, quite literally, Escambia County’s past and future colliding in a single location, the story of a place boiled down to fundamental physics. It was observable states of matter: The solid, sprawling success of Navy Federal — and the gaseous remnants of an ancient polluter haunting heavily over Escambia's promise for progress.

By the time we reached the water, thankfully, the riverbank was stank-free. The Perdido River, anointed as “Outstanding Florida Waters” by the state of Florida, had some gospel music of its own going on. As the dark waters flowed slick beneath our bright plastic boats, an infinite and invisible choir wove a birdsong on columns of oxygen that flowed perpendicular to the river, just above our paddles and heads.

We were accompanied by my adorable in-laws, West and Amy Calhoun. As Pensacola natives who grew up in the area, working for years as acclaimed custom home builders, they are well familiar with the pained legacy of the stench that greeted us on the drive down to the river. With the obvious contrast of the infamous aroma and the surrounding nature, West shared something he had read in the most recent newsletter from Friends of Perdido Bay and legendary local environmental guardian, Dr. Jackie Lane.

According to Dr. Lane’s report, “the federal permit for IP has expired.” In addition, she wrote that the last state permit from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection had been issued in 2010. “The Florida DEP also issued a Consent Order which expired in March 2019,” she wrote.

Any environmentalist will attest that IP is an age-old enemy of the local waterways, specifically, Eleven Mile Creek and Perdido Bay into which it has dumped many, many millions of gallons of toxic wastewater over the decades. Stricter regulations forced the company to improve some practices in recent decades. But anyone with a half-a brain and a couple nostrils will tell ya, it ain’t exactly Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory that’s operating up there. And the stuff they're dumping in Escambia County's once-pristine waterways is neither edible nor tasty.

And if Dr. Lane is correct, and the company’s permit is indeed expired, then why the heck are they still allowed to be dumping anything in the water at all?

If you or I get caught driving without a license, guess what happens? If a home builder doesn’t get a proper permit, guess what happens? And if a local restaurant is found in violation by the health inspector, guess what happens?

I called the local DEP offices on Wednesday to find out about the current status of IP’s permits. External Affairs Manager Brandy Smith called back Thursday morning. I asked for the current permits and sent her Dr. Lane’s most recent newsletter that alleges the mill is in violation.

At 3:40 p.m. Thursday, the DEP responded by email saying that IP was operating under a 2010 permit that was set to expire in 2015. But, since IP's application for Permit renewal was ""timely and sufficient in accordance with Florida Rule Chapter 62-62 .335 (3)"" (which means 180 days before the expiration date), the 2010 permit remains in effect until the DEP ""takes final agency action on the application.""

Huh? Try that excuse next time your car payment is late.

Essentially, state rules say that even though there is something called an ""expiration date,"" nothing actually ""expires"" if the DEP doesn't get around to approving or denying the permit. Which in this case, has apparently taken the DEP more than 4 years.

Smith said she did not know the specific factors that may have extended the IP permit process for 4 years, but she promised a follow-up phone call to understand why it would take the DEP such a long period of time to ""take final agency action"" — a lack of action which has allowed a notoriously harmful company continue polluting under a permit from a decade ago. Cool.

Smith was very nice and helpful, and honestly, it's probably an impossible challenge to explain the logic of state operations. To average citizens, this stuff seems nuts. What's the point of deadlines, permits and expirations if everyone can just ignore them? And how can a permit for one single business possibly take 4 years to decide on?

I'll update when we get a fuller explanation from DEP. But even if government agencies approve the ongoing operations of Escambia's infamous paper mill, that doesn’t mean the local community should.

There was a day when the mill might have been one of the most important, historic employers in the county. And perhaps there was some economic argument that seemingly justified the destruction of our precious local waterways. But that day has done gone.

As far as important employers go, Navy Federal is the new history-maker in Escambia County. It’s a clean, talent and brain-driven company that has far surpassed any sort of impact the paper mill ever dreamed of having on the region — and without wreaking havoc on natural waterways.

So sucking up the Sunday morning stench outside Navy Federal's campus, the symbolism couldn't be more striking.

How absurd that a dwindling polluter is allowed to literally stink-up the air at a game-changing culture-creator like Navy Federal?

And how foolish that a company that reports about 450 jobs is allowed to continue destroying the environment underneath soon-to-be 10,000 employees at a company who is trying to build a stronger and healthier community in Escambia County?

Heck, Navy Federal could probably hire all 450 mill employees themselves if they wanted to.

So even if you forget the environmental destruction, and even if you look at it from an intensely economic, greed-motivated, Scrooge-McDuck-style point of view, keeping IP around just doesn't make sense.

In other words, what IP is bringing to the bank, just ain’t worth the stank.

We'll have more on all this soon. In the meantime, get outside and enjoy the nature. As long as you can put up with the smell.

432,Ed Killer: Here are six suggestions about where Algae Task Force should start,"CLOSE Mary Radabaugh, manager of Central Marine Stuart, shares a summary of the marina's frequent fight with toxic algae-filled summers. Leah Voss, leah.voss@tcpalm.com

Gov. Ron DeSantis fulfilled one of his campaign promises by naming a five-person Blue-Green Algae Task Force. The Task Force will work under the direction of Thomas Frazer, the state's first chief science officer, who begins in his new role Monday.

""It's one thing to go and get the resources,"" DeSantis said during the announcement at Nathaniel P. Reed National Wildlife Refuge in Hobe Sound, ""but I want to make sure when we are applying those resources, we are prioritizing the projects which are most urgent, and doing what we can to effectively deal with the nutrients, to deal with the algae, and to deal with the red tide.""

""Well we were exploring, and we knew that they were still releasing water out of Lake O, and I was curious to see how much flow was coming,"" Pete said, adding that he wanted to see how much green algae was coming. ""You can actually see it here."" (Photo: XAVIER MASCAREÑAS/TCPALM)

DeSantis said the task force will:

Identify opportunities to fund priority projects with state, local and federal funding;

Build on DEP's updated Basin Management Action Plans;

View and provide the largest and most meaningful nutrient reductions in key waterways.

What will that look like? It may be a few weeks before we start getting word from the first meetings convened by this Task Force.

I'm a veteran observer of how badly toxic algae can foul Florida's waterways. Along with millions of Floridians, I suffered through the scuzzy harmful algae outbreaks of 2005, 2013, 2016 and 2018. I never want to see it again, but I know I will. Probably way too soon.

I took it upon myself to offer up six steps I think the Task Force should take. Perhaps these could lead to future recommendations the Task Force hands over to the Department of Environmental Protection, state Legislature and Gov. DeSantis. Then it will be up to them to act.

Here are my suggestions:

Step 1: Determine where there is problematic algae now. Short-term solutions should take precedence over long-term solutions. Believe it or not, there is already a bloom of cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa, according to a DEP sample, west of Lake Okeechobee in the waters near the W.P. Franklin Lock and Dam at Alva. It's bright green and getting thicker each warm sunny day. The Task Force, in my opinion, should quickly identify which algae is in which location. Determine how bad the outbreaks are. Evaluate which ones are the most harmful to humans. Calculate which ones are the most widespread. And then project which ones will become the biggest problems in the coming weeks and months.

Step 2: Stop its spread. Don’t let it move from one place to another. Contain it. This should be treated like we treat any human contagion. After all, it has been linked to diseases of the liver and brain. In February, at the Army Corps of Engineers’ Lake Okeechobee System Operating Manual scoping meeting in Stuart, Capt. Rufus Wakeman of Jensen Beach addressed this in his comments: ""Last year, the Army Corps knowingly dumped toxic algae into our communities — That’s messed up.” It is. These toxic algae blooms need to be managed as a human health crisis similar to how the health department manages an outbreak of Hepatitis A, measles or MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).

Step 3: Mobilize resources to kill it or remove it. What seriously lacked in the past ""lost summers"" of algae outbreaks was action. There was a little monitoring. Some measuring. There was a ton of complaining and protesting to elected officials, but very little actual action. Many homes in Florida have the technology in their backyard pools to remove algae. Filters, scrubbers, chlorination or other chemicals will do the trick. The problem, of course, is scaling up the processes to be effective near a canal, lake or river. It sounds daunting. But if we can use a voice-activated assistant to bring us tacos with a drone, we can totally handle this.

Step 4: Identify nutrient sources. This is a step toward longer-term solutions, but find the nutrient sources. When it comes to Lake Okeechobee, Florida's largest lake, we know it has been pounded with phosphorous and nitrogen for decades. We know almost all the water comes from the north. So figure out where, when and how this happened.

Buy Photo Central Marine on Aug. 6, 2018. (Photo: LEAH VOSS/TCPALM)

Step 5: Stop the nutrient loading into Florida's waterways. The Basin Management Action Plan system put in place during former Gov. Rick Scott's administration is a farce. How does a community receive credits for cleaning water by publishing a brochure? Fix this. Actually stop the nutrients from running off lands and into waterways. Get serious about fixing and removing septic tanks, spreading biosolids from municipal wastewater systems, applying fertilizer and applying other destructive pesticides.

Step 6: Address legacy nutrient loads. Yes, it's a challenging problem. So let's roll up our sleeves and do something about it. Scoop out the muck. Put it somewhere, at least temporarily until we can destroy it properly.

If I was to add one more step, it would be to get cracking. Florida's next historic toxic algae outbreak could be only a couple of rainstorms and a few hot days away. June 21, the first day of summer and the longest day of the year, is rapidly approaching. What we learned in past years is that the toxic algae really celebrates this day by blooming with added fervor.

The last thing we need is to ruin the state's once-pristine waters by smothering them annually with blue-green gook.

433,The right-left divide is clear as day in legislation passed this session | Bill Cotterell,"Does it seem that Florida legislators are passing laws, more often than they used to, for the purpose of scoring political points – rather than setting policy for the state?

Of course, they’ve always done that to some extent, going back to the “interposition resolution” of the 1950s and other silly symbolic acts aimed at defying the integration orders from federal courts. But at least, in those days, legislators knew they were just pandering to voters.

Now it seems they really intend to see even their most controversial legislative actions carried out. Until those dreaded federal judges say otherwise, some of the big bills produced along strict party lines this year will do little more than clearly define the difference between Democrats and Republicans.

Or between liberals and conservatives, which is pretty much the same thing.

Take the immigration bill, for instance. Like President Trump, Republicans purport to perceive a law-and-order crisis caused by undocumented migration, and to believe it can be eased by forbidding local governments to adopt “sanctuary city” policies. There are no sanctuary cities in Florida, at least not in the San Francisco sense, but Gov. Ron DeSantis and other GOP candidates promised voters last year they’d get tough on this situation.

CLOSE Around one hundred protestors chanted in the Capitol rotunda after nearly a dozen were removed from the House gallery for unfurling banners and yelling. Tori Schneider, Tallahassee Democrat

Democrats, meanwhile, pretended not to understand why local governments should have to comply with an “immigration detainer” from the feds. Those are issued when a law-enforcement agency believes an arrested person may be a “removable alien” under federal law.

“The actions of the Florida Legislature today simply don’t represent the richness and diversity of our state,” Andrew Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor and 2018 Democratic nominee for governor, said in a prepared statement. “Republican legislators pushed through a vicious bill – despite bipartisan opposition – that brings shame to a state that prides itself in the richness of its cultures….”

DeSantis, who beat Gillum last November, saw it a bit differently.

“We are a stronger state when we protect our residents, foster safe communities and respect the work of law enforcement at every level,” the governor said. “Local law enforcement agencies can and should work with the federal government to ensure that accountability and justice are one in our state.”

Such widely divergent views of the same bill makes us wonder if the long, starkly partisan debate was really about passing a needed law or pandering to partisans on either side. Everything else is details.

The same can be said of the school vouchers legislation sent to the governor’s desk earlier in the week. A handful of House Democrats voted for the plan, which uses state tax money to pay tuition at private schools for needy students, but there was an easily identifiable partisan divide.

And forbidding local governments, for the next five years, to ban the use of plastic straws? That one was generally Republicans yes, Democrats no.

Arming teachers in the classroom? Nobody really likes the idea but if you showed a newcomer the rollcall on that legislation and asked what is the Republican-Democrat population of the House and Senate, they might reasonably guess the numbers are roughly the same.

And down to the 60th day of the session, they wrangled with implementation of Amendment 4, the proposal more than 5 million voters approved last November to restore voting rights of felons who’ve served their time. Republicans generally wanted to make it harder for ex-cons, requiring financial restitution many of them can’t pay, while Democrats demanded that lawmakers just follow the clear direction of the voters.

Maybe they were all just thinking of fairness and good public policy. Or maybe there was a little virtue-signaling on both sides – Republicans posturing as tough on crime, Democrats showing they know how most of those guys are likely to vote, with their rights restored.

On another down-to-the-wire issue, probably prompted by that felon-voting public initiative, Republicans sought new restrictions on gathering voter signatures. The Democrats were, predictably, opposed. Guess which side accomplishes what it can via constitutional amendments put on the ballot with voter signatures.

There were a couple of bills filed this session on the biggest defining difference between Democrats and Republicans – abortion – but that one didn’t get a big debate. Georgia, Alabama and a few other states passed bills likely to get the issue back before the U.S. Supreme Court.

But if the leadership wants another bitterly partisan floor debate, complete with shouting protesters in the rotunda, they can always move some abortion bills next session. Best of all, it’ll be an election year.

The moisture will surge from the trough (a low-pressure system in the upper levels of the atmosphere) developing heavier showers and scattered thunderstorms through the evening.

The winds will be from the southeast, and it will still feel muggy and warm tonight. Low temperatures will remain in the low 70s, and for some areas to the south of Orlando, temperatures will stay in the mid-70s and muggy.

Check the water temperatures

Winds along the east central coast of Florida

Expect the moisture to stay put over Central Florida through Friday, producing the chance for scattered showers and isolated storms through the afternoon. Showers on Friday afternoon will move mainly from the southwest to the northeast. Storms will likely affect the coast Friday afternoon.

There is a high risk for rip currents along our east coast beaches, make sure to swim near a lifeguard, if you must go in the water.

RAINFALL FORECAST

Generally, throughout Central Florida, rainfall could range between half to one inch. Higher isolated amounts south of Orlando and toward the Space Coast. Some places inland where heavier showers and storm become more persistent could have amounts close to one inch and a half thorugh Friday afternoon.

WEEKEND FORECAST

The National Hurricane Center continues to give this area of disturbed weather a 20 percent chance of developing once it parallels Georgia and the Carolinas. It will remain over the Western Atlantic and a cold front will keep it over sea by late this weekend.

At this point, it would not represent a danger to Florida, as it will be moving north and then out to the open Atlantic.

The front is currently scheduled to reach Florida early next week, but it seems to become stationary over Central Florida. Depending on strength, it could mean scattered showers Monday and Tuesday. We will continue to monitor the evolution of this next front and update you on TV, online and our WFTV Weather app.

For Central Florida, there is a low chance for scattered storms, mainly in the afternoon this weekend.

The winds will be from the south Saturday and from the southwest Sunday. Due to the wind direction Sunday, the temperatures will likely reach the 90s.

Our team of certified meteorologist will monitor the system as it moves closer to Central Florida and track the showers and storms as they develop.

435,Hepatitis A Outbreak: The effect on the local economy,"With the number of cases on Hepatitis A on the rise in South Florida, officials in Martin County are warning residents to be safe but also warning business owners about the toll the outbreak could take on the local economy.

This comes as the Hepatitis A outbreak has reached record numbers across some parts of Florida.

Right now, Palm Beach County has 22 confirmed cases, Martin with 19, St. Lucie with 6, Okeechobee with 3 and Indian River County not yet reporting any cases.

“It could go from being an issue to being a crisis relatively quickly,” Commissioner Ed Ciampi told us. Not just a health issue, he says, but one that affects the bottom line. “Some of the restaurants, especially those who cater to an older clientele, their business is way off.”

On Flagler Avenue, some shop and restaurant owners say they’re concerned and agree with Ciampi with the possibility of the economy taking a big hit.

Tim Horton has owned Luna’s, an Italian restaurant on Flagler Avenue, since 1991. When health officials made the announcement about the outbreak, Horton told us he’s seen fewer customers.

“We did see a drop in business for a couple of days,” Horton told us outside his restaurant though at the same time he realizes that as the outbreak is expected to get worse, he’s prepared to see some tough times ahead with some people too scared to eat out. “They’re probably going to avoid going out to eat.”

Commissioner Ciampi says if that continues, some restaurants might have to close their doors, something no one wants

“As we head out of season, if they lose the local customer base, some of them could go out of business,” Ciampi said. “When the tourists go home or don’t come but now the locals don’t come out to eat either, then we start to have a real economic situation on our hands which we’re trying to avoid.”

Campi went on to say county officials are working with the Chamber of Commerce to keep people dining out. They’re using #palmcitydinesout on Twitter.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - A local family at the center of a medical custody battle is fighting to get their son back.

Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball left Hillsborough County on Monday with their 3-year-old son, sparking a multi-state search. The three were eventually found safe in Kentucky.

Authorities put out urgent alerts for 3-year-old Noah, saying the boy was in need of ""lifesaving medical care."" Hillsborough County deputies said McAdams and Bland-Ball failed to bring him to a medically-necessary hospital procedure last week and refused to follow up with additional lifesaving medical care.

The couple tells News Channel 8 they were avoiding getting the boy chemotherapy. Noah has leukemia and his parents wanted to treat him with something other than what doctors recommended. They told us the chemo would be too tough on Noah's body.

""Since he's been with us, his health has completely gotten back to normal levels,"" McAdams said.

In court Wednesday, Noah's parents asked for custody of the boy. But the sheriff's office and guardian ad litem program says they don't want the media there due to health and age concerns.

Noah's parents don't mind.

""We feel like it's silly. Why postpone it - what's there to hide?"" Bland-Ball said. ""Everything has already been talked about. It's all over media, all over TV all over social media.""

The couple tells us they're not opposed to treatment, they just want to do it differently. Social media posts show they previously spoke out against the use of chemo. Bland-Ball credited her son's improved health to vitamins and alternative treatments.

""We want him to be treated with something that has less side effects,"" Bland-Ball. ""Chemotherapy is so brutal on a body.""

The judge postponed Wednesday's custody hearing to Friday at 1:30 p.m. but later bumped it up to Thursday.",https://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/hillsborough-parents-fighting-to-get-sick-son-back-after-removing-him-from-hospital/1970785289,2019-05-02T16:28:29Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
438,Sea turtle that swallowed fishhook released back to sea after treatment at Brevard Zoo,"- The Brevard Zoo has released a rehabilitated green sea turtle back into the ocean after it spent months recovering from swallowing a fishhook.

'Kernel' the sea turtle--named for arriving to the zoo on National Popcorn Day-- was admitted to the Brevard Zoo's Sea Turtle Healing Center back in January. Veterinarians said the turtle had swallowed a fishhook which required surgery to remove.

“Accidents happen, and you won’t get in any legal trouble for inadvertently hooking a sea turtle,” said Shanon Gann, the Zoo’s sea turtle program manager. “If possible, don’t cut the line, and use a net to safely guide the sea turtle to shore or onto your boat; in fact, many piers have nets available for this purpose. Do not reel the sea turtle in as this could deepen the wound.""

“This is what the couple that hooked Kernel did, and that decision quite possibly saved Kernel’s life.”

Kernel was nursed back to health with antibiotics, fluids and nutrition, according to the zoo.

He was released on Wednesday to a round of applause from the animal care team.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/sea-turtle-that-swallowed-fishhook-released-back-to-sea-after-treatment-at-brevard-zoo,2019-05-02T16:05:46Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

The renovations are expected to wrap up in the next few weeks. At 8 a.m. Friday, May 24, Walmart executives, along with local dignitaries, nonprofits and community members, will celebrate the grand reopening of the store.

""It'll be a big event to reintroduce the store to the community,"" Jones said. ""We're going to have vendors, different mascots like Tony the Tiger, cupcakes, that type of stuff.""

The store will also be giving out special grants to various local nonprofits, something it usually reserves for Christmastime.

""The customer experience is going to be very streamlined,"" Jones said. ""There won't be as many wide valleys, so it keeps the departments more together in their classifications, not separating things as much as they were before.""

The event May 24 is open to the public.

442,10-foot great white shark pings off Melbourne coast,"CLOSE Miss May, a 10-foot great white shark, was tagged off Jacksonville OCEARCH, Florida Today

A few days before May, Miss May pinged.

The 10-foot-long great white shark, named Miss May by research organization OCEARCH, surfaced off the coast of Melbourne on Tuesday.

""Since we tagged her a couple months ago, she has swum a huge lap around the southern half of the NASFA region,"" OCEARCH said on Twitter.

The 10-foot, 2-inch-long great white has been hanging around the Melbourne coast (miles and miles away, of course), pinging at 8:13 p.m. April 29, then 6:51 and 8:11 p.m. April 30. Before Miss May's ping in Melbourne, the shark pinged off the coast of Canaveral National Seashore near Scottsmoor at 6:21 p.m. April 26.

Before this week, it's been a while since Miss May pinged off the Space Coast. The shark last pinged here in February.

447,Florida State preparing for life after Meghan King with use of young pitchers,"CLOSE The Seminoles were held to two hits and were 0 for 10 with runners on base. Curt Weiler, Tallahassee Democrat

Florida State is planning for the future.

The No. 4 FSU softball team (40-8, 12-5 in ACC) is all too aware of the fact that this is Meghan King's final season.

The Seminoles have relied on their senior pitcher with great regularity -- she has 21 of the team's 40 wins and has thrown 47.2 percent of FSU's innings this season -- but they've also been grooming their pitchers of the future.

Most notably, freshmen Makinzy Herzog and Kathryn Sandercock, whose roles have grown significantly as the season has progressed.

For proof, look no further than Wednesday's loss to No. 6 Florida in Tallahassee. After King threw a complete game shutout in Gainesville on April 3, FSU head coach Lonni Alameda turned to her younger pitchers in the second game between the rivals.

Herzog got the start and Sandercock entered in relief as the pair allowed a combined four runs on 10 hits over seven innings.

Even in defeat, Alameda was looking at the positives of their performance.

""Meghan's going to graduate unfortunately and she's going to move on. We've got some amazing kids behind her, they need experience and (Wednesday) they showed that they can handle a big environment, they can handle a big-hype game and they handled some really good hitters,"" Alameda said after the UF loss.

""When you look at that part of it, yes people get caught in the results, but I look at some of those moments those kids were out there, they grew today. That's what you need to build on with experiences and the team behind them. Now they know what they can expect from them.""

Herzog (6-2) bounced back Saturday as she allowed no runs on three hits over six innings in FSU's 7-0 win over Boston College to clinch the series.

The Seminoles will go for the sweep of the Eagles Sunday at 1 p.m.

Herzog's strong showing dropped her earned run average to 1.82 as she's thrown 57.2 innings over 10 starts and 16 appearances and held opponents to a batting average below .200.

She has also proven to be an extremely competent bat for the Seminoles. Herzog is hitting .318 and has two home runs and 16 runs batted in as an occasional member of the lineup.

Sandercock hasn't thrown in the first two games of the BC series, but enters the weekend with a 2.33 ERA and a perfect 10-0 record including wins over No. 1 Oklahoma and No. 18 Minnesota.

More impressively, both Sandercock and Herzog have done this as true freshmen while King redshirted her first season before posting 2.30 ERA as a redshirt freshman in 2016.

""I think our freshmen on the mound really learned a lot and got a lot better,"" FSU infielder Sydney Sherrill said.

""We're going to take that on with us for the rest of the season.""

King's spot in the lore of the FSU softball program was secured with her ridiculous effort in the circle that led the Seminoles' run through the Women's College World Series.

More: Florida State softball focused on learning, not losses during slump

She posted a WCWS record 0.20 ERA and amassed four of FSU's six wins in Oklahoma City on the way to the program's first national championship.

King currently sits in third on FSU's all-time leaderboard in wins (98, 11 off Lacey Waldrop's record) and fourth in appearances (160, 19 off Leslie Malerich's record). She also secured the program-record 10th save of her career in FSU's 4-1 win at Louisville on April 6.

While King has continued to impress on the mound this season with a 1.61 ERA over 143.2 innings of work, she's also focused on the future of the program.

She's taken it upon herself to be a leader of FSU's young pitching staff which will be back in its entirety next season except for her.

""Meghan has been a really good role model for me,"" Herzog said.

""She's my roommate, too, when we stay in hotels so it's really cool to just get to spend time with her and talk about the games and the process. She helps me a lot with that stuff.""

As much as FSU may want to rely almost entirely on King during the postseason, Alameda knows it wouldn't be wise, both for the present and the future.

That's why she's made sure to throw her freshmen into the fire of high-profile games and high-leverage situations. She knows the team will need them ready for the moment both now and in the not-so-distant future.

""It's not even just our freshmen in the circle, it's our team playing behind the freshmen to gain that cohesiveness so when you get some freshmen out there in the next couple weeks in postseason, they have some consistency with our defense behind them,"" Alameda said.

""That was exciting momentum for us to move forward.""

A Florida woman who was arrested for her 2-year-old son's beating death claimed her ghost has been comforting her while her boyfriend remains behind bars, WFTV reported.

Victoria Toth and her boyfriend, Johnathan Pursglove, 26, of Orlando, were charged with aggravated manslaughter in the 2018 death of Toth's son, Jayce Martin.

The boy reportedly suffered a ""sucker punch"" that was hard enough to drive his spine through his intestines, the news station reported, citing a medical examiner. He was also malnourished and could have been saved had he seen a doctor, the report states.

Toth has since been released from jail and the couple has been staying in contact as she awaits trial, despite being ordered not to. Toth got away with visiting Pursglove in jail due to a clerical error, according to the news station.

The report sheds light on the couple's conversations during those visits, which mostly focused on Jayce.

""I talk to Jayce and he tells me that this is something that we are supposed to go through,"" Toth said. ""Hearing Jayce tell me that we're going to get through it gives me something to hold onto.""

The couple also spoke with Pursglove's mother about the possibility of his car being impounded.

""He goes and sits down at his desk, looks something up on the computer, probably at what your charges were or some kind of crap and goes 'we can't do anything,'"" Pursglove's mother said, according to jailhouse records.

Phone calls revealed Toth once believed her son's ghost was following her around and playing pranks.

She is due back in court in July.",http://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-mom-charged-in-son-s-death-says-his-ghost-comforts-her/1923870005,2019-04-13T23:26:17Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

Seven-month-old JT Borofka of Salinas, California, is one of 60 people worldwide diagnosed with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, an extremely rare disease that is life-threatening. TPI is a genetic, multisystem disorder with complications like respiratory and heart failure. In addition to the TPI, he has hemolytic anemia, which is premature destruction of red blood cells in the body which requires blood transfusions.As the disease progresses, other symptoms include neurological damage that can lead to paralysis, and intellectual disability, tremors and dystonia. “We believe, and the doctors believe, that he’s the first person to be detected with this very rare disease before the neurological and major symptoms start,” said Jason Borofka, the JT Borofka's father.The boy is Tara and Jason Borofka's only child.They said when he was 2 months old, their pediatrician detected low iron and oxygen levels in JT Borofka’s blood and sent them to Stanford Children’s Hospital in Palo Alto. He was diagnosed with TPI in March after five months of grueling testing. It was a gene panel test that confirmed the TPI diagnosis.“Our doctors at Stanford and their team are scrambling to come up with a cure or some type of treatment for our son,” Jason Borofka said.There is no known cure or course of treatment for TPI, and this is the first case ever documented in the state of California. “The doctors gave him two to five years to live, and he said it's going to be very tough on us and that it was going to be horrible. We cried for a solid week, for sure, but now we’re holding on tight and we’re going to try and beat this,” Borofka said.Later this month, JT Borofka will be admitted to Stanford Hospital for a week where doctors will try an experimental ketogenic diet to see if it improves his iron and oxygen levels.The Borofkas go to Stanford weekly, where he routinely has his blood drawn. “The struggle is how many times he has to get his blood drawn. There isn’t a parent out there that can stand watching their kid getting his blood drawn,” Jason Borofka said. It is the couple's hope that by sharing their son’s story, it will raise awareness about TPI and ultimately lead to a treatment or cure. “It’s more important that we’re building awareness, especially around our little community and we’re really building a team. Awareness is almost more important than raising all the money,” he said.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/7-month-old-diagnosed-with-disease-so-rare-it-has-no-cure-or-treatment/27361535,2019-05-04T03:50:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
462,This is how far you can really drive on empty,"Ah, the burning question everyone wants to know the answer to: How far can your vehicle really go on empty?

We found the answer for you! And there are a couple other things worth mentioning, too.

OK, for starters, aside from the obvious problems running out of gas can entail — getting stranded on the side of a busy highway, somewhere miles from civilization or when it’s blazing hot or freezing cold and you have kids in the car — driving on empty can also do damage to your vehicle.

According to Your Mechanic, driving with a low amount of fuel in your gas tank can damage your fuel pump, due to any debris or contamination in the gas — which can just naturally settle at the bottom of the tank — that can be sent through the pump. If you do it once, it’s probably not that big of a deal, but it can be harmful if you’re doing it regularly.

OK, so on to the nitty gritty — how trusty is that gas gauge?

In short, not very.

When your vehicle offers an approximation for how many miles you have until empty, that’s based on the average mileage your vehicle has attained while previously on the road, so it may not be accurate to your current driving conditions, Your Mechanic said.

And finally: How far can you actually drive on E?

via GIPHY

The answer to this question really depends on a number of things:

Your vehicle

Your driving habits

NEW YORK (WFLA) - Blake Lively made a surprising reveal at a red carpet event this week - she's pregnant!

Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds arrived at the New York City premiere of Reynolds' new ""Pokémon: Detective Pikachu"" movie on Thursday night. Lively stepped onto the red carpet wearing a yellow dress that showed off what appeared to be a baby bump.

The 31-year-old actress rested her hand on her belly as she posed for several photos alongside her 42-year-old husband.

464,"Kiker recalled as a leader open to new ideas, but with the ability to persuade","CLOSE Lee County Commissioner Larry Kiker died on April 23, 2019. He was 67. Oscar Santiago Torres and Bill Smith, Wochit

More than 500 people – family members, local political and business figures and friends he met in his years living and working in Fort Myers Beach – shared stories and memories Thursday during services for Larry Kiker, the late chairman of the Board of County Commissioners for Lee County.

Kiker died Tuesday, April 23 at Hope Hospice at Healthpark after a five month battle with lymphoma.

In eulogizing Kiker, local real estate entrepreneur Stan Stouder referred to the late commissioner as simultaneously respectable and relatable. Stouder focused on Kiker's leadership roles and his willingness to take risks and to challenge ideas that had become conventional.

""He was never okay with 'that's the way we've always done it,'"" Stouder said. ""That was never an answer that was acceptable.""

Watch replay: Memorial service for Lee County Commissioner Larry Kiker

Kiker

The service lasted close to an hour and included remarks from current leaders of the two elected boards on which Kiker served, the Fort Myers Beach Town Council and the Board of County Commissioners.

""His absence in this world is palpable,"" said Anita Cereceda, one of Kiker's successors as mayor of Fort Myers Beach. ""I like to think of him up in heaven, sitting at a big conference table with only the smartest of angels around — in my mind, St Peter is coming into the room for a presentation, clueless that he doesn't stand a chance once Larry starts his pitch.""

Stouder found Kiker's pitch in favor of one or another public policy position less the product of imposing his will than in listening to others and encouraging them to challenge the way things had always been.

""He was not a yes man,"" Stouder said. ""Larry woud call, not often, but he would call and try to roundtable an idea. He wasn't calling to confirm his conclusion, he wasn't calling to affirm his view, he was calling to get a perspective.""

For most of his time in Southwest Florida, Kiker lived with his wife, Paula, in Fort Myers Beach. The couple later moved to south Fort Myers after selling their beach home.

Kiker's first public office was a member of the Fort Myers Beach Town Council, where his colleagues elected him to the largely ceremonial post of mayor for five years. He then ran for county commissioner, defeating incumbent Ray Judah in the Republican primary in 2012

Before entering politics, Kiker worked in the burgeoning high technology industry, with customer service positions at companies such as Sun Microsysterms, Data General Corp. and IBM.

Thursday's service, which were held overlooking the Gulf waters from which he cruised into Fort Myers Beach for a one-night stay only to remain for the rest of his life, focused on Kiker's relationship with his wife Paula and his political life over the past few years

""When I think about Larry, I think about what a servant leader he was,"" Stouder said. ""He wasn't about Larry, it wasn't about what Larry could get out of this — he made great changes because I think he really cared about us, he really led as a servant leader.""

Brian Hamman, who serves as vice chairman of the county commission, spoke on behalf of the board, relating how Kiker's strong philosophical differences with Commissioner Frank Mann would sometimes yield what he termed ""violent agreement,"" to the good-natured surprise of both.

""All of us remember Larry as more than a colleague,' Hamman said. ""He was our friend. That's more important than any program or policy that we passed.""

465,What's the smelly brown gunk hugging Captiva's shoreline?,"CLOSE Aerial view of toxic algae bloom flowing in a canal Friday, July 14, 2018 in Cape Coral, Florida. news-press.com, news-press.com

Hasn't Lee County had enough stinky gunk in its waters lately? Apparently not, as evidenced by the spongy rafts of floating foulness currently bedeviling Captiva. It's blanketing Roosevelt Channel and the Captiva Drive shoreline, lined with homes that start at about $1 million.

Here’s how island resident Carroll Wetzel described the mess in an email he sent earlier this week hoping to get it identified.

“The stuff (is) clogging up the mangroves and around our dock. It is not like the blue green algae, which I gather … is a thin layer. This is brown and puffy like cotton. It smells horribly. Smells terrible,” he wrote. “One of my neighbors who is very close to it has closed up at his house and turned on the AC because of the smell.”

Photos of the spongy mats have been turning up on social media as well, with speculation that – what with the color and revolting smell and all – it might be raw sewage.

After a series of emails flew back and forth between the city of Sanibel, the Lee County Health Department and members of the local media, Rick Bartleson settled the fecal matter question: It’s not poop. It’s algae – cyanobacteria, to be exact.

Yes, cyanobacteria is the awful toxic stuff that fouled Lee County freshwater, devastated wildlife and triggered a state of emergency declaration last year, but this cyanobacteria (there are thousands of separate species) is a different variety.

Which variety precisely is still in question, but Bartleson, a research biologist with the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation’s marine lab, is confident it’s not one of the cyanobacteria in the microcystis group, the kind that caused all the recent trouble. Bartleson also is confident that, stench aside, this stuff isn’t toxic.

Instead, he said, its sudden bloom is a sign of an ecosystem out of balance from excess nutrient loading. In plain speech, that means it’s been over-fertilized. The fertilizer, in the form of nitrogen-rich water, gets washed into the Gulf from excessive runoff, which can come from development, wetland destruction and ditching, he said.

“The literature suggests that its abundance is influenced by nutrient pollution,” said biologist and Sanibel’s director of natural resources James Evans. “It is commonly an indicator of eutrophication,” scientist-speak for what happens when too many nutrients enter the water, usually through human disruption, such as runoff from lawns, septic tank leaks or air pollution.

Although cyanobacteria is usually blue and/or green – hence its common moniker, blue-green algae – this stuff is decidedly closer to the puce section of the color wheel (the . brownish red area).

That’s because, “in addition to the chlorophyll, it has a lot of phycoerythrin,” Bartleson said. “which is pink.”

Another reason for the bloom may be that red tide killed off the underwater critters like sea hares that would normally graze it down and keep it in check, Bartleson said.

“We had hypoxic (oxygen-starved) water coming into Blind Pass after an upwelling event when we had the dead zone last year,” he said. “That did in a lot of grazers.”

How would Bartleson rate this event on the crisis scale?

“Low. Seagrasses are temporarily shaded and starved when they get covered up, but the mats float away eventually.”

One word of caution, though: Keep your dog away from it.

“It can look sort of like poop and a dog might eat it,” said Bartleson. “A couple of dogs got sick after visiting the causeway when it was thick there a few years ago.

466,Northview tops Jay for district title behind Aubree Love's grand slam,"CLOSE Northview head coach Amy Holland recaps the Chiefs' late grand slam in an 8-2 win over Jay in the District 3-1A title game. Eric J. Wallace, ejwallace@gannett.com

“...We’ve worked four years for this... We’ve played together since we were like five or six years old so we really needed this. We worked hard all season for it.” - Northview's Aubree Love

Story Highlights Northview softball topped Jay to claim its first district title since 2012

Senior catcher Aubree Love hit a go-ahead grand slam in the fifth inning

Northview senior slugger Aubree Love left a championship-winning mark at Jay High School on Thursday night at the small price of a chip to her teeth.

Love laced a go-ahead grand slam in the top of the fifth inning to lift the Chiefs to an 8-2 win over rival Jay in the District 3-1A championship game. It was Northview's first softball district title since 2012.

Kept under wraps by Jay starter Alyssa Baxley and trailing 2-1 after four innings, the Chiefs’ breakthrough came with the bases loaded for their veteran catcher, who roped the first pitch after a Jay pitching change into the trucks lining Jay’s outfield wall.

“They changed pitchers in the middle of my at bat so I just knew they were going to try to get me shaken up a little bit,"" Love said. of the grand slam. “I stepped up in there with a two-strike approach even though I didn’t have any and I hammered one. It got the job done for my team.”

The emotions of the grand slam overwhelmed the Chiefs dugout and fan section.

Moments after her home run trot crossed the plate, Love caught a helmet to the face that chipped her tooth, a painful moment that still didn’t prevent her from returning behind the plate just a few minutes later.

It’s not the first injury to affect Love this year as shoulder problems required surgery last summer. Her recovery ultimately dragged into the 2019 season.

“She missed the first couple of games and she was a little disappointed in herself,” Northview head softball coach Amy Holland said. “She’s worked hard and come back. Tonight she was just big for us. That was big time.”

Love entered Thursday’s contest as Northview’s leading hitter in several categories, including batting average (.457), hits (31) and RBI (23). Thursday’s home run was her second of the season.

Alongside starting pitcher Tori Herrington – who held Jay scoreless over the final four innings and entered Thursday with an 0.61 ERA – the Chiefs are hoping their long awaited district title is just the beginning of deeper state tournament run.

“Being freshmen on varsity, we’ve worked four years for this (district title),” Love said. “My pitcher Tori has worked her butt off for this so we deserve it… We’ve played together since we were like five or six years old so we really needed this. We worked hard all season for it.”

That journey will begin next week as the Chiefs host a region semifinal on May 9 at 7 p.m. The Royals will travel in their opening round game on the same day.

First-round matchups will be finalized with the FHSAA in the coming days.The Chiefs will enter the playoffs on a seven-game win streak since losing to Jay on April 12.

“This year, we’re just focusing in on going all the way,” Holland said. “That was the goal they started this year off with and I’ve got faith in them. They’ve worked really hard.”

467,'A force' for goodness: Longtime library FriendShop manager Helga Jackson remembered by patrons,"Helga Jackson. (Photo: Peggy Adair/Special to the Democrat)

Those who knew Helga Jackson echo each other: her wide, bright smile, warm hugs and energetic personality were magnetic.

For the past 14 years, Jackson was the familiar, friendly face at the FriendShop, the bookstore she ran at the LeRoy Collins Public Library off Park Avenue.

Jackson died April 24 after a quiet battle with cancer. She was 63.

""It won't be the same going in there without her,"" said Daniel Parker, who frequented the library and FriendShop with his family.

When his daughter Arwen, 11, found a book she liked, Jackson would often whisper to her, ""I'll buy it.""

""She was just a pleasant, authentic, loving person,"" Parker said.

Jackson was born in Kronach, Germany. She met her husband Morris Jackson when he was a U.S. soldier stationed in the country. The couple married in 1981 in Bad Tolz, Germany when she was 25 and moved to Tallahassee where Morris has family, friends said.

Jackson knew her customers well, with a keen knowledge on their tastes. When a 45-rpm record of ""Purple Rain"" was donated to the shop, she knew just the right person for it.

She'd decorate the store with colorful posters and artwork, was meticulous about organization and was a driving force behind the Friends of the Library fundraiser.

""Helga was someone who only had friends. She liked people very much. I think a lot of her customers came back partly because of the merchandise — but a lot because of who she was. She was very friendly, very caring and she had a great sense of humor,"" said Library Director Debra Sears. She's known Jackson for 13 years. ""She genuinely cared that people could find things that they were interested in and the shop was welcoming.""

Coworkers and friends say the woman was a private person who didn't speak much of herself. She instead exuded a warm curiosity.

She was ""always happy and always asked you about yourself,"" said Darby Tish, Friends of the Library president. ""She was just a gem... She gave the best hugs. She would almost crack your back when she gave you a hug. She was a force.""

In her spare time, the vibrant woman loved gardening, caring for stray cats and taking long strolls.

""I would have loved to say goodbye,"" Parker said. ""The best goodbye is just to remember her because I didn't get to say goodbye.""

468,Look for rainy Friday from early season tropical disturbance,"Buckle up for a rainy Friday as a tropical low pressure area moves over Florida's east coast. It's unlikely the stormy weather will mean an early start to the 2019 hurricane season, but weather forecasters are watching it closely.

Rain chances overnight Thursday and Friday are 60 percent, said the National Weather Service office in Melbourne.

The National Hurricane Center puts the chance of tropical storm formation at low — less than 10 percent — over the next five days. The low pressure trough ""extends from South Florida northeastward across the western Atlantic for a few hundred miles,"" the Hurricane Center said Thursday morning. The system is forecast to move northeastward over the southeastern United States coast through the next couple of days.

Rain chances are 30 percent on Saturday and 50% on Sunday, with highs in the high 80s.

The system arrives just as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration prepares to kick off its annual hurricane preparation week, starting Monday.

NOAA won't release its forecast for the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season until later this month, but Phil Klotzbach at Colorado State University's early April forecast indicated this summer's activity could be slightly below-average, given a likely weak El Nino in the equatorial Pacific and cooler than normal ocean temperatures in the Atlantc Ocean so far this year.

469,Lawmakers back front-yard vegetable gardens,"Floridians would be able to grow fruits and veggies in their front yards without running afoul of local ordinances under a bill going to Gov. Ron DeSantis

The Florida House on Wednesday gave final approval to a measure that would prevent local governments from regulating homeowners’ vegetable gardens. The 93-16 vote will send the bill (SB 82) to Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The issue stems from a dispute between homeowners Hermine Ricketts and Laurence Carroll and the village of Miami Shores over an ordinance that banned front-yard vegetable gardens. The couple had maintained a front-yard garden for nearly two decades but uprooted their vegetables when faced with the possibility of fines. They challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance but lost in court, with the Florida Supreme Court last year declining to take up the issue.

House bill sponsor Elizabeth Fetterhoff, R-DeLand, said Wednesday the legislation involves fundamental rights and that government has “no business” telling Floridians they can’t grow their own food, no matter where they live.

“Although simple in nature, this is a very important bill,” Fetterhoff said. The bill, sponsored in the Senate by Appropriations Chairman Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, cleared the Senate in a 35-5 vote on March 21.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190502/lawmakers-back-front-yard-vegetable-gardens?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T08:02:17Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
470,Miami-Dade police officer fatally shoots armed man believed to have killed wife,"MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - A Miami-Dade police officer fatally shot a man believed to have killed his wife Wednesday morning during an ""extremely violent situation"" at their home, police said.

Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez said officers received a call about a domestic violence incident inside the gated Caribe Lakes community on Southwest 154th Court.

Perez said police believed ""someone was potentially killing someone else."" He said the first officer to arrive had to intervene and entered the home.

""What can only be described as a horrific scene, he found a deceased person,"" Perez said.

Perez said the officer encountered a man armed with a knife and was forced to fire, killing him.

""The officer potentially saved some lives today,"" Perez said. ""Unfortunately, he had to take someone's life in the process.""

Perez said the couple's children -- a young adult and teenager -- were also inside the home.

""We believe this is a husband and wife situation,"" Perez said. ""The wife is dead on the scene as well from extreme trauma to the body.""

Perez said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the shooting, while Miami-Dade police homicide detectives will investigate the wife's death.

On June 30, Schaffer, her mother Stacey Bender, 51, stepfather Paul Bender, 56, and sister Brooke Schaffer, 13, were vacationing in Exuma, in the Bahamas. They were in a tour boat on their way to see pigs that swim in the sea.

But, ""five minutes into it, the boat exploded right under my seat,"" Schaffer said. ""Both of my legs were broken beyond repair,"" leading to amputations below her knees.

Her other injuries included compound fractures of her left arm and right wrist; a broken left femur; broken pelvic bones; a broken back and lacerations to her kidneys, liver and spleen. Both her lungs had filled with blood. And she underwent dialysis for three months.

Her family was also hurt in the explosion that day.

Stacy Bender had a broken left leg and right ankle; fractured right wrist, broken ribs, a collapsed lung and internal injuries similar to Stefanie's but not as severe, she said.

Brooke Schaffer was knocked out for a little while and Paul Bender was thrown to the front of the boat; the back of his head was cut open, requiring stitches.

Also aboard the boat was Maleka Grimes Jackson of Tennessee, who was killed in the explosion. Her husband Tyran Jackson survived, and like Schaffer and her family, was flown to South Florida and treated at a Broward Health hospital.

Recently, at the end of the Schaffer-Bender family's weeklong vacation in Key Largo, they stopped at Broward Health in Fort Lauderdale.

Stefanie Schaffer wanted to ""meet the doctors that had really saved my life that I wasn't really conscious to meet. My parents got to know them but I never really got the chance to thank them. I really just wanted to show them what they've given me the opportunity to achieve.

""Because without them, I wouldn't be here,"" she said.

Some of Schaffer's former caregivers, including nurse Rafael Toloza, who has a daughter the same age as Schaffer, and Dr. Christopher Roberts, a neurosurgeon, were brought to tears at the sight of her.

Roberts had performed a fusion procedure on Schaffer's spine, and also took away bone fragments from the lower portion of her spinal cord, which is stabilized with titanium rods and screws.

He greeted her with a hug and a warning not to go snowboarding just yet.

""But we'll get there,"" Roberts told her.

""A lot of times we fix patients and that's it,"" he said. ""Occasionally you'll get a card from another state or another country. But to actually see someone that you touched like this and walking like that, nobody warned me about that. It was a hell of a surprise.""

Her doctors' confidence in Schaffer's recovery, which seemed long and far away for her battered body during those six weeks last summer, helped her to power through another 16 weeks of treatment in two different Boston hospitals.

In all, she has had more than 25 surgeries, and still has 20 doctors who are helping with everything from scar management to physical therapy and pain from the prostheses that she began walking with in November, her parents said.

While in treatment in Boston, Schaffer was visited by survivors of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, in which three people were killed and more than 200 injured. Some of those amputees taught her to look to the future.

""All the time I thought (why me?) in the beginning,"" Schaffer said. ""But one of the Boston bombing victims said when you go through something like this, you can't just keep thinking 'why did this happen?' and 'why me?' because then you're just stuck in it. So I tried to stop asking that question.""

Schaffer doesn't hide her artificial limbs or evidence of her injuries. And for the hospital visit, she chose a short sundress and cute sandals to wear. The toes of her prosthetic feet were painted a light blue — because they were boring before, she said.

""When I first got hurt, I thought I would never be able to show my prosthetics,"" Schaffer said. ""I thought I would never wear shorts again, never wear a bathing suit again, never wear a dress again.""

When she was a patient at Broward Health last summer, ""even if it was 85 degrees out I would cover myself with blankets and I'd go sweat outside and I would refuse to take it off.

""But now, I mean I'm in a dress showing my prosthetics,"" she said. ""I think realizing how much work it takes (to walk with them) makes me more proud to wear them. So people can just understand maybe what I've gone through a little bit. I'm just not embarrassed by it anymore.""

For the pretty, petite brunette, what others may think of her appearance is no longer important.

""Even before I got the prosthetics, I would go around with no legs and covered in scars,"" Schaffer said. ""I knew people were staring but it just didn't really bother me anymore. And that would have just killed me before the accident.""

As Schaffer masters using her new legs, she said she is realizing how hard it is to do.

""I can't feel the ground when I am walking,"" she said. Where her legs meet the devices, there is pain and the skin breaks down. There are fitting issues, and she has phantom limb pain. And her back hurts if she spends too much time in her wheelchair.

""Your whole body has to be strong just to stand up,"" Schaffer said. ""When I first started I couldn't hold myself up, even with parallel bars and a harness. Now I can hold myself up without holding on to anything. But that took a long time.""

Schaffer wants to finish her final year at Castleton University in Vermont, where she is majoring in public health. She wants to earn a master's degree in the same subject, and eventually work with people who have disabilities.

She isn't dating, and said, ""I never really dated before the accident, either. It's a possibility. We'll see.""

Learning to drive with hand controls is also on her to do list.

To those who survive life-altering injuries that require extensive rehabilitation, she said, ""The most important part is to stay motivated. Even when it feels like it's not gonna get any better.

""The medical staff can do their part, but the rest is on you,"" she said. ""And you have to keep going to therapy and you have to keep pushing yourself hard. Because if you don't, you never know where you're gonna get to.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190505/woman-who-lost-legs-in-explosion-remembers-miracle?rssfeed=true,2019-05-05T16:19:58Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
477,American Airlines now offers direct flights between Daytona Beach and New York,"DAYTONA BEACH — Jill Brownfield stepped off her American Airlines flight from New York and was greeted by smiling Daytona Beach International Airport employees handing out free tote bags to passengers.

""Come have some refreshments,"" an employee said, motioning to a table filled with New York City themed cupcakes, drinks and balloons.

""This is so nice,"" Brownfield said. ""I usually fly into Orlando, but this is more convenient.""

Brownfield was one of 77 passengers on the American Airlines' first direct flight Saturday from LaGuardia Airport in New York to Daytona Beach.

The flight comes on the heels of JetBlue Airways pulling their services from Daytona Beach in January. They were the only airline offering direct flights between Daytona Beach and New York.

""I was bummed when JetBlue went away,"" Brownfield said. ""I live in LA and travel to New York for work. My family lives here in Daytona, so I like to swing by on my way home.""

Without the direct flight, customers wishing to fly between the two cities would have to either switch plans in Charlotte, North Carolina, or take a direct flight to Orlando or Jacksonville.

Jay Cassens, director of business development for Daytona International Airport, said the American Airlines was quick to fill the hole JetBlue had left. The airline is currently offering nonstop flights Saturday and Sunday.

""It's huge for us,"" Cassens said. ""New York is by far our biggest market and to have this connection means everything to our passengers.""

More than 250,000 people flew via JetBlue's New York-Daytona Beach service over the past three years, said airport director Rick Karl.

""It is extremely important for us to have this direct flight,"" Cassens said. ""JetBlue proved there was a market for these nonstop flights.""

For Eileen and Andrew Weingram of New Jersey, the direct flight makes it more convenient to fly to their vacation home in Port Orange.

""Our son is also planning on going to Embry-Riddle (Aeronautical University),"" Eileen Weingram said. ""Without this flight we'd have to fly into Orlando or have a layover.""

The couple flew down for a day to help Andrew's mother Judy Weingram look for a house in the area.

""The direct flight makes me want to move here from New Jersey,"" Judy Weingram said. ""We're flying back tomorrow. This flight made that possible.""

Debbie Meihls, executive director of the New Smyrna Beach Area Visitors Bureau, said a lot of the tourism in Volusia County, and the state, come from New York.

""Everyone looked really happy getting off the plane. They are excited to be here,"" Meihls said. ""New York is a feeder market for Florida and Volusia County.""

Meihls said visitors prefer direct flights especially if they are flying with young or older family members.

""It's very important to a lot of flyers,"" Meihls said. ""They get to their destination quicker.""

Cassens said he hopes American Airlines will add more direct flights between LaGuardia and Daytona Beach in the future.

""We hope this weekend service will become a daily service,"" Cassens said. ""As long as our community continues to fills the seats it'll happen.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190504/american-airlines-now-offers-direct-flights-between-daytona-beach-and-new-york?rssfeed=true,2019-05-04T16:53:22Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
479,Ups and (mostly) downs at the Sarasota Kennel Club,"Florida voters decided to abolish live greyhound racing by the end of 2020. The Sarasota Kennel Club is stopping a year early, after 75 years.

Maybe it was the way his stride quickened as he approached the celestial doors of the dog track, or the heaps of crumpled-up betting slips he left on the beer-splotched floor, or the $1.5 million he lost over the years, even after all those nights he was certain the 3-6-2 in the eighth was going to pay off big. Maybe that's why he never married. Maybe that's why his girlfriends couldn't stay.

There was one lady in particular, Jim Samuels remembers, and one night at her place that was most telling. He informed her he was sick. Must have been something he ate and he needed to get home immediately.

So he said goodbye and drove off in his truck. Only he didn't go home. He never really could. His girlfriend, it just so happened, tailed him right to the Sarasota Kennel Club.

""And that was the end of that romance,"" he said.

The end of another has come as well. Voters decided in November to abolish live greyhound racing in Florida by the end of 2020. The SKC is stopping a year early. After 75 years it is over.

No more pretending to understand racing forms, picking dogs named after Fred Flintstone, quinella boxes, the squeaky sound of ""Swifty"" clanking around the rail, someone invariably yelling ""come on 3, get in there 3,"" whooshes at the finish line, standing along the fence in the spring sun, numbers rolling on the tote board, beer in your hand, hot dog wrapper at your feet, program in your back pocket, no cash in your front, telling everyone you are even for the day, walking out a little unsettled, yet ready to do it all over again.

Except that's it, no more live racing at the SKC.

No more stories, either.

Like the time Pete Rose showed up with a bag containing $60,000 in cash and lost it within a few hours.

Jack Collins Jr. — whose family runs the SKC — was playing golf that day. His phone rang.

""Can Pete Rose cash a check for $14,000?"" the person asked Collins.

""Yeah, I guess,"" Collins responded.

It wasn't long before the $14,000 was gone, too.

Or the time an esteemed handicapper known as ""Santa Claus"" bet $4,000 at the SKC on a simulcast horse race and won $50,000. You should have seen his face when he found out the teller had mistakenly punched in his bet as a dog race, not a horse race. Yep: Void.

""He went berserk,"" said Samuels. ""They almost had to put him in a straitjacket.""

Or the time lightning caused a power outage during live racing. So what did Samuels and the other hard-cores do? Why, nothing of course. They just sat in the dark and waited for the power to be restored so they could bet some more.

""We're all so sick we won't leave!"" Samuels recalled, while shaking his head.

Or the time in 1987 when Oral Roberts claimed God would call him home if he didn't raise $8 million.

SKC owner Jerry Collins, after reading in the newspaper that Roberts was a bit short of his goal, handed track publicist Phil ""Boomer"" Denis a personal check with instructions to write it out to Roberts for $1.3 million.

Collins, a 10th-grade dropout who amassed a fortune buying and selling parimutuels, was said to be worth $75 million at the time the check was written. The Collins family has owned the track since 1944 after Jerry assumed $5,005 in back taxes. It was originally built in 1929.

Taking Jesus home

As it turned out, God didn't take Oral Roberts home, but Samuels once took Jesus home.

No one remembers Jesus' real name, but he was a SKC regular who wore his hair in dreadlocks. One night after a hard day betting, Samuels and Jesus went out drinking to ease the sting. At the end of the festivities, Jesus asked Samuels for a ride back to his condo.

""It's 3 a.m. and I'm trying to find this guy's condo,"" Samuels said. ""I'm driving with my brights on, and the next thing I know we're in the woods behind the tote board and he gets out and crawls into a refrigerator box. That's where he lived, dude, in a box.""

What was Jesus doing living in a cardboard box behind the dog track? Shouldn't he have had all the winners?

""Yeah, you'd think,"" Samuels said. ""He was a pretty good handicapper though.""

What gave the track even more character were the nicknames bestowed on the regular bettors and workers. Longtime patrons still talk with reverence about former employee Bill ""Smoothy"" Folchetti, who passed away in 2011. ""Boomer"" — the late Phil Denis — was the announcer who came up with the calls ""Swifty's on a Roll"" and ""Tight, Tight, Tight"" after photo finishes. Bill Herald, the self-proclaimed best handicapper in the history of the SKC, was known to all as the ""Great and Mighty Fish.""

Dave Steves started winning so much he quit his job with the postal service around 1991 and came to be called the ""Postman,"" or ""Posty"" for short.

There was once a guy so streaky they called him ""Flicker.""

""He'd show up at the track one day in a Corvette and two weeks later he'd be driving a Nova,"" Samuels said.

John Payne somehow hit the Pick 6 jackpot a few consecutive times, much to the ire of Jerry Collins.

""His exact words were, 'Nobody could hit that thing four times in a row,'"" said his grandson Jack Collins Jr. ""He must be an (expletive) wizard.""

For the next 25 years Payne was known as the Wizard.

Princes and monks

Let's see, a Saudi prince showed up at the track one night. The late Gary Coleman did, too. So did George Straight. And one of the guys from ZZ Top — though no one's quite sure which one. And from Nolan Ryan to Don, who knows how many baseball players left the track lighter than they arrived. Deion Sanders stopped by one night and announced, as only he could, ""I'm here to pet them not to bet them.""

It wasn't just celebrities either.

""A couple of years ago I met a Buddhist monk,"" said longtime attendant Leo McCarthy.

Samuels, a 62-year-old Bradenton roofer who has been coming to the SKC for 40 years, has seen it all: From a husband and wife slugging it out in the parking lot — ""I told you to bet the 2-6-8 dammit"" — to people going into cardiac arrest after winning, to people crying after losing.

He has seen dogs jump the fence and run into the infield pond. He's seen the mechanical rabbit known as ""Swifty"" stop in mid-race and dogs try to attack it. He once saw a guy rob a teller, jump the fence and run across the track during a race, though no one had him on a ticket.

And how many times has he sat next to a guy on his cell phone and overheard a version of this nugget: ""Honey, we're just going to bowl one more game. I'll be home in 45 minutes.""

Samuels still gets a kick out of the handicappers who walk in with brief cases full of charts like they are the Wolves of Wall Street.

Even after live racing ends the serious handicappers will still congregate in front of television screens as simulcast races from around the country will be available to bet at the SKC.

""They're just as full of it as anyone else,"" Samuels said. ""No one here knows what the hell is going on.""

'I'm about even'

Yet no one's ever walked out a loser, either.

""Everyone's a liar when it comes to gambling,"" Samuels said. "" 'How ya doing today?' 'Oh, I'm about even.' Yeah, right.

""I grew up eating split pea soup because of my father's gambling and to hear him tell it he never had a losing season in 75 years.""

The biggest ticket ever cashed was when someone four years ago hit the Pick Six during a Breeder's Cup simulcast for $266,000. For live dog racing someone hit a Pick Six in the 1980s for about $100,000. The ’80s were the glory years. It was not uncommon for the track to bring in $1 million a day during live racing, especially on Saturdays, Jack Collins Jr. said. So many people would show up that the 17 acres behind the tote board were used for additional parking. It's all woods now.

Samuels once hit a Superfecta simulcast from Aquaduct for $113,000. He had two 99-1 shots on his ticket. He walked out of the SKC with $40,000 in cash and a $40,000 check after taxes.

He tipped the window tellers $3,000 then shuffled off to the local strip joint, where he dropped another cool grand.

""I pissed it all away,"" he said. ""I bought a new truck and just basically doubled down on my betting. I went through it all in a couple of weeks.""

In the old days, the dogs used to run in a Florida loop: Four weeks in Sarasota, four in Orlando, four in St. Petersburg. For the hardcore gamblers, it was like following the Grateful Dead. Nothing meaningful ever came from it, but what an adventure it was.

Once, Samuels was on his way to Derby Lane in St. Pete when his truck broke down. Someone picked him up and drove him there. Soon he was broke. He took some money out on a credit card and won $20,000.

Another time he was driving to Derby Lane, frantically trying to make it to the first race, when his engine blew out. He abandoned his truck at a gas station, took a cab to the track, lost all his money, and took another cab back home to Bradenton. Cost him $150.

""When you're sick, you're sick dude,"" he said. ""It's a sickness you can't control.""

There were times Samuels would bring $20,000 to the SKC, but only take $1,000 inside to bet. That way he would go home with a minimum of $19,000. It always sounded like a good plan, but he never could go straight home.

""I'd keep going back and forth until it was gone,"" he said.

He said he had weeks of losing as much as $40,000 and would kite checks to cover himself.

When asked how much he has lost over the last 40 years at the SKC, betting on both the dogs and horses, he was not hesitant to answer.

""I'd say, realistically, I'm a million and a half down.""

Seriously?

""Hey, I told you, it's a sickness, dude.""

And yet it almost seems worth it.

""Walking in, you get this mystic cloud over you,"" Samuels said. ""And when you see your horse or dog coming down the stretch it's a big high and you're waiting to see what it pays.""

Only now it’s all over.

After one last bet at the Sarasota Kennel Club, after everyone winds up even for yet another day, it will be time to go home, really go home.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190503/ups-and-mostly-downs-at-sarasota-kennel-club?rssfeed=true,2019-05-03T16:54:51Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

SOMEBODY WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED INTEGRITY AND HONESTY IN PUBLIC SERVICE INSTEAD OF THE ETHICAL CLOUD THAT HANGS OVER THIS ADMINISTRATION. THEY WANT A PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS, NOT JUST A PRESIDENT FOR 37% THAT THIS PRESIDENT CONSIDERS HIS BASE AND I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE WHEN WE’RE TALKING ABOUT JOBS AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION, GROWING OUR ECONOMY, THAT PEOPLE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO IS FOCUSED ON MAKING THE COUNTRY BETTER IN THE FUTURE, NOT ON MAKING THE COUNTRY ANYTHING AGAIN AND TAKING US BACKWARD. I’M THE CANDIDATE THAT WILL TAKE US INTO THE FUTURE. >> YOU TIME TO DIGEST THE MUELLER REPORT. DO YOU BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT? >> I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD. THE REPORT POINTED OUT 10 INSTANCES. 10 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE. IT’S VERY CLEAR FROM THAT REPORT THAT BOB MUELLER ESSENTIALLY PUT THAT INTO THE HANDS OF CONGRESS. NOW, DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP IN CONGRESS IS SAYING THAT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO IS SUBPOENA BOB MUELLER, HERE IS TESTIMONY AND DO MORE INQUIRY, WHICH IS FINE. I BELIEVE AT THE END OF THAT, WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET TO IS THE SAME POINT, THAT THERE WERE 10 DIFFERENT INSTANCES WHERE HE TRIED TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE. THE QUESTION BECOMES, ARE YOU GOING TO HOLD THIS PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RULE OF LAW? I BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD BE. SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID, WELL, THAT MAY NOT MAKE SENSE POLITICALLY.

THERE ARE 19 OTHER CANDIDATES GOING OUT THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY TALKING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT HOW WE CAN CREATE MORE JOBS IN THE COUNTRY, HOW WE CAN ASSURE THEY HAVE BETTER HEALTH CARE AND GET A BETTER EDUCATION.

A COUPLE DAYS AGO I WAS IN LAS VEGAS AND I WENT TO LAS VEGAS AND I VISITED THE STORM DRAINAGE TUNNEL THAT RUNS UNDERNEATH THE LAS VEGAS STRIP. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVING OR HOMELESS UNDERNEATH THIS TUNNEL. THE IRONY OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF CASINOS ON THAT STRIP AND UNDERNEATH THAT, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS. TO GET TO YOUR POINT, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT DOING WELL RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A LOT OF INCOME AND YOU QUALITY, A LOT OF POVERTY THAT UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION IS SIBLEY NOT BEING ADDRESSED BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS TELLING OF THAT EVERYTHING IS GOOD FOR EVERYBODY, WHICH IS NOT TRUE. >> HOW WOULD YOUR ECONOMIC POLICIES MAKE THE ECONOMY BETTER? >> NUMBER ONE, I WOULD INVEST IN EMPOWERING EVERYDAY AMERICANS TO SUCCEED IN BETTER EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN, UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE’S THEY DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD HEALTH CARE IF THEY DON’T HAVE A JOB OR IF THEY LOSE THEIR JOB. ALSO, INVESTING IN THINGS LIKE BETTER APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS, JOB-TRAINING PROGRAMS INCLUDING IN RURAL AMERICA’S OF PEOPLE HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO GET A JOB. THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT DON’T NEED ANYBODY BEHIND AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, I WOULD TURN AROUND THE LAST 40 YEARS OF A TAX CODE THAT IS ASKED LESS AND LESS OF PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP AND BIG CORPORATIONS AND HAS ASKED MORE AND MORE OF THE MIDDLE-CLASS AND THE WORKING POOR SO THAT THERE IS MORE BALANCE IN THIS COUNTRY. >> THE BUS IS GETTING PRETTY FULL ON THE DEMOCRATIC FIELD, A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNING. YOU ARE ON THE YOUNGER END OF THE SPECTRUM. DO YOU THINK GENERATIONALLY, IT’S TIME FOR AMERICA TO LOOK TO NEW LEADERSHIP THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE PERHAPS -- >> I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I’M 44 AND I WOULD BE 46 ON ELECTION DAY. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE THE FOURTH YOUNGEST PERSON RUNNING IN THIS RACE, BUT EVEN IF I WEREN’T RUNNING, WHAT I DO HERE OUT THERE IS THAT PEOPLE WANT A NEW GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP. THEY WANT NEW BLOOD IN WASHINGTON, THEY WANT NEW IDEAS. I DO THINK THAT WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO SEE IS, AS THIS CAMPAIGN GOES FORWARD, MORE PEOPLE GRAVITATING TO A NEW GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP. >> THIS WAS THE EASY STUFF, NOW IT’S TIME TO HEAD OVER FOR THE TOWN HALL.

482,"Ashlyn Harris, fiancée Ali Krieger make US World Cup soccer team","Ashlyn Harris is heading to the City of Love this summer and, coincidentally, it already has been a love-filled year for the former Satellite High soccer goalkeeper.

Thursday, she was selected to represent the U.S. National soccer team in its quest to win the FIFA World Cup, which culminates in Paris, France. She also had made the gold medal-winning team in 2015 in Canada, where she was a backup to Hope Solo.

""I'm excited for her,"" said Harris' father, Mike, who lives in Satellite Beach. ""It's not an easy thing to do, especially to make it back to back.""

More: Satellite High grad Ashlyn Harris, fellow soccer star Ali Krieger engaged

Ashlyn, 33, will be joined by Orlando Pride teammate and fiancée Ali Krieger, who in March announced their engagement after dating for nine years. Krieger, a 34-year-old defender, recently got a call-up to the national team and quickly made coach Jill Ellis' roster.

""I'm very proud for them,"" said Mike, reflecting on all the national attention they received when their engagement became public. ""They're both good people and that had a lot to do with it.""

Also making the team is the third Pride pro soccer teammate, Alex Morgan, a forward who scored her 100th international goal last month.

There are three warm-up matches remaining for the Americans, but Ellis released the names of the 23 players on the roster Thursday.

Ashlyn began playing soccer by the age of 5 in a co-ed league in Satellite Beach, first in a field position, then adapting to the goalkeeper slot. When she played in a 12-under boys league in Palm Bay as a 9-year-old, her career took a turn.

""She was pretty good,"" he dad said. ""And as far as I'm concerned, she still is. Just a little older, though.""

In the 2016 Olympics in Rio, Ashlyn also played behind Solo, whose national team career came crumbling down after her remarks following a loss to Sweden.

Ashlyn has made 21 career appearances with the U.S. national team, including two games this year, and is averaging a shutout every three matches.

The captain for the Orlando Pride currently leads the National Women's Soccer League in total saves but missed the game against Utah (a 1-0 loss) when she injured her left knee in pregame and was held out as a precautionary measure.

""When I got there, I saw her talking to the goalkeeper coach and I'm thinking, 'Uh-oh,' but it was nothing serious,"" Mike said. ""She was training yesterday.""

Harris won the Gatorade National Player of the Year award while at Satellite High, then went on to North Carolina to play for the Tar Heels, where she collected three national titles. She has received the Key to the City of Satellite Beach.

This summer, the USA will face Thailand on June 11, Chile on June 16 and Sweden on June 20 in Group F at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.

After a couple of recent standout efforts, it was almost certain Ashlyn would lock up one of the three goalkeeper slots, although Alyssa Naeher, 31, is the apparent starter.

""I was waiting for the official announcement,"" Mike said, ""because the way things go, you never know.""

Recently, the U.S. National squad collectively filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation making a case for equal pay to their male counterparts.

In the meantime, just last month Adidas announced that all athletes on the winning team of this year's women's tournament will receive a bonus payout equal to that of the male players. And last September, FIFA doubled the total prize money in the entire Women's World Cup to $30 million, starting in France.

Yes, already it's been a lovely year, in more ways than one.

""She's had a pretty good career and it all started here,"" Mike said. ""And it's not over yet.""

483,Police took a cancer-stricken toddler from his parents. Their supporters call it a 'medical kidnapping.',"""MISSING ENDANGERED CHILD!"" read an urgent alert from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office that blasted across the news.

Less than two weeks after 3-year-old Noah was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, his mother claimed the cancer was gone.

""We busted out of that hospital - with no cancer cells left to spare,"" Taylor Bland-Ball wrote on Facebook on April 16. ""Doctors are amazed at his speedy healing and strength!""

The 22-year-old holistic birth attendant from Tampa said her son had undergone two rounds of chemotherapy - ""because they can get a medical court order to force you to do it anyways for a child with his diagnosis"" - but also tried a number of home remedies. Rosemary and colloidal silver, reishi mushroom tea and bitter apricot seeds, to name a few. ""This is one of our many alternative therapies for healing. #NatureHeals,"" she wrote.

But by Monday, police were telling a different story about Noah's healing progress.

""MISSING ENDANGERED CHILD!"" read an urgent alert from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office that blasted across the news.

""On April 22, 2019 the parents failed to bring in the child to a medically necessary hospital procedure,"" the sheriff's office wrote, naming Bland-Ball and her husband, Joshua McAdams. ""The parents have further refused to follow up with the life saving medical care the child needs.""

The alert launched a nationwide hunt for the couple and their son, Noah, a toddler with long curly brown hair and big brown eyes. In a matter of hours, they were located in Georgetown, Kentucky. Noah was taken from his parents and was ""now being medically treated,"" the sheriff's office said in an update. And his parents, meanwhile, were being investigated on suspicion of child neglect.

Since then, the case has attracted national attention as Bland-Ball and McAdams insist they were trying to find their son alternative medical care, accusing the police and medical officials of stripping them of the right to choose their own treatment plan for their son. Their supporters call the state's decision to take custody of Noah a ""medical kidnapping"" - a term that's become common in communities skeptical of traditional medicine when authorities take drastic measures to provide medical care they see as essential to the child's well-being.

The parents await a custody hearing Friday.

""We're not trying to refuse any kind of treatment,"" Bland-Ball told reporters Wednesday, according to WFLA. ""They think we're refusing treatment all around, putting him in danger, trying to kill him. But not at all. We're trying to save him.""

Experts have warned against stopping treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, however.

Bijal D. Shah, who leads Tampa's Moffitt Cancer Center's acute lymphoblastic leukemia program, told the Tampa Bay Times that the treatment has been remarkably successful, with a cure rate of 90 percent - but that it can require two-and-a-half years of chemotherapy. Stopping the treatment early, he said, means the cancer will almost always come back.

""I put it in the same box as those who fear vaccination,"" he told the newspaper. ""The reality is, what we risk by not taking chemotherapy, just as what we risk by not taking vaccines, is much, much worse.""

But an organization fighting on Bland-Ball and McAdams's behalf, Florida Freedom Alliance, which supports ""vaccine freedom,"" argues that the couple should be entitled to ""medical freedom"" and freedom from ""medical kidnappings.""

Modern medicine skeptics have recently claimed ""medical kidnappings"" in a whole range of scenarios, including among the anti-vaccination groups. Bland-Ball and her husband's case unfolds at a time when so-called anti-vaxxers are clashing with authorities seeking to stop a measles outbreak not seen in decades amid a spread of misinformation about vaccines. In some locations, such as Rockland County, N.Y., authorities have enforced court orders banning unvaccinated children from attending school.

In one notable case in February, police in Chandler, Ariz., busted down a family's door in the middle of the night with their guns drawn to seize a dangerously feverish, unvaccinated 2-year-old and bring him to the hospital. The boy's mother had reportedly ignored a doctor's orders and refused to take him to the emergency room, fearing authorities would report her for failing to vaccinate the boy.

In New York, child protection authorities took custody of a 12-year-old boy fighting leukemia last September after his mother refused additional chemotherapy treatment. The mother, Candace Gunderson, told News 12 Long Island that she took her son to Florida for alternative holistic treatment, but that when authorities found out, her son was seized and returned to New York to continue chemotherapy. She lost custody, she said, calling it a ""medical kidnapping.""

""They don't want me to be able to exercise my freedoms to choose medical treatment for my child,"" Gunderson told the news station.

Nonprofits such as the American Cancer Society have long warned against such ""alternative"" treatments.

In a January article, the American Cancer Society noted that about 40 percent of Americans believe cancer can be cured through alternative, unproven therapies alone, citing a 2018 survey by the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

""This is alarming,"" the cancer society noted, citing the study's findings, ""because evidence shows that people who use alternative therapies in place of standard cancer treatments have much higher death rates.""

Bland-Ball has said that she did not want to continue chemotherapy for her son because it was invasive, and since she believed the cancer had gone into remission, she did not believe it was necessary anymore.

""We want him to receive a treatment that has less side effects, because chemotherapy is so brutal on a body, even an adult body, so think of what it's doing to a little person who's only 30 pounds,"" she told reporters Wednesday. ""We want to get him something that's healthier, that is more biologically sound for him, specific to him and not just a standard protocol that they use for everybody, because he's an individual.""

She and McAdams said that's what they were looking for in Kentucky. Before they left for Kentucky, photos on Bland-Ball's Facebook feed show her taking him to the beach and feeding him grapefruit for ""Vitamin D & Vitamin C Therapy"" and trying organic juices and Madagascar periwinkle plants. Once they were apprehended in Kentucky, Bland-Ball defended herself on Facebook, writing, ""No neglect here considering his levels are the best they've ever been and still cancer free after two weeks without chemotherapy - shocker!""

Since they were apprehended by police, Noah's parents say they have not seen him and do not know where he is or how he is being cared for, medically or otherwise.

""I haven't slept,"" she told reporters Wednesday. ""I've eaten one banana. I've been a total anxious mess, not being able to do anything except think about him, think about what I can do to help speed up this process to just see him again and know what's going on.""

Dozens of supporters have rallied around the family, some of whom have attacked the police for taking the 3-year-old into custody.

""Medical kidnapping is real!"" one wrote on Facebook in response to the police's urgent ""MISSING ENDANGERED CHILD!"" alert.

Katherine Drabiak, an assistant professor of bioethics and genomics at the University of South Florida, told WFTS that if courts and police step in to take a child into custody for medical reasons, it is considered ""absolutely a last resort."" She said it is worth scrutinizing whether additional chemotherapy was warranted in this case, but that the state ""has a duty"" to step in if it feels a child is at risk.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190502/police-took-cancer-stricken-toddler-from-his-parents-their-supporters-call-it-medical-kidnapping?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T14:20:00Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
486,Scooter bill would allow micromobility devices onto the road,"The Florida Senate passed a bill Wednesday that would allow municipalities to regulate e-scooters in the same way as bicycles.

House Bill 453, sponsored by state Rep. Jackie Toledo, would allow scooters to be driven on the asphalt in the bike lane.

Rep. Mel Ponder, who voted for the HB 453, first saw the bill when it went through the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, where Ponder sits on the board.

""The bill, in my opinion, is a very good bill,"" Ponder said. ""The bill mainly does a couple things: it defines what a scooter technically is and also says they have some rights.""

This bill changes regulations that kept many companies like Lime and Spin from setting up shop in Florida. Lime and Spin are scooter rental companies that offer dock-less vehicles that can be found and rented through an app.

""We're so congested with traffic anyway,"" Ponder said. ""This is much faster than walking, but it will definitely provide tourists and guests another legal way to get around town.""

Current law keeps any motorized vehicle that can't hit 30 miles per hour from being allowed onto the road, which keeps scooters on the sidewalks.

HB 453 brings that speed down to 20 mph, a speed many e-scooters can hit.

Owners of Coastal Cruisers, a 13-year bike and scooter rental business in Destin, John and Rose Kile said they don't like the idea of companies like Lime being allowed into the community. The couple agreed it was less from a business perspective, but more for the safety of the community.

Rose said this opinion of these companies came after a recent trip to Dallas where she saw many scooters belonging to companies like Lime laying in the middle of the sidewalks.

""They have just become a litter hazard,"" Rose said. ""They literally just lay on the sidewalk. They fall over. They're leaned up against tress. They're in a pile on the side. They're cool, but I've heard of a lot of injuries because no one trains them on (the scooters) or they don't provide the helmets.""

""Don't want them,"" John added.

Other than that, John said the bill sounded good to him. John also mentioned the importance of safety after the March death of Destin resident Joel Iral, who was killed in a vehicle-involved scooter accident.

""I'd rather have (the scooters) in the bike lane than on the sidewalks because they're faster moving,"" John said. ""... We have multiple-use paths here. You can ride your bike on a sidewalk and/or a bike path, which isn't used nearly as much as a sidewalk.

""Getting that traffic off of the sidewalk and onto the bike path would be a really good idea if they govern it.""

One reason Ponder was once against the bill was the lack of disaster mitigation rules in place.

He said he worried if a situation like Hurricane Michael happened again, there would be no rules to keep the potentially thousands of scooters from becoming a storm hazard.

Ponder said he supported the bill because of the amount of local control given.

""It empowers local government to implement the rules,"" Ponder said.

HB 453 will be effective upon becoming a law if signed by the governor.",https://www.waltonsun.com/news/20190502/scooter-bill-would-allow-micromobility-devices-onto-road?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T08:53:56Z,The Walton Sun,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
487,"No charge: One Hour Air gives WWII veteran, wife a new air conditioning system","CLOSE WWII Marine Corps veteran Oliver Marcelli received a new air conditioning unit, donated by One Hour Air Conditioning and Heating, on Wednesday, May 1, at his house in Naples Park that he shares with Mary Marcelli, his wife of 75 years. Alex Driehaus, Naples Daily News

Oliver Marcelli has dealt with some challenges in his life. The New Jersey native enlisted in the Marines before the Pearl Harbor attack, and fought his way across the Pacific in World War II.

Now he’s 97, and he and his 96-year-old wife, Mary, live on a fixed income in their Naples Park house. The air conditioning system, about 20 years old, couldn’t be fixed anymore, and the Marcellis didn’t have the money to replace it.

Oliver had spoken to several contractors but couldn’t afford the prices any of them quoted. But on a referral from Bill Fuller, chairman of the We Served veterans service group based at St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church, he called One Hour Air Conditioning & Heating, formerly Wiegold & Sons.

The technician who came out to inspect the unit, Ruddy Azcuy, was also a Marine veteran. He told Marcelli he would talk to his general manager.

“Ruddy told me, ‘It’s a no-brainer. We’ve gotta take care of this,'” One Hour general manager Chad Huddleston said.

And they did. The company donated a new air conditioning system, paid for the permit, and donated their time to install it, said Huddleston. Fittingly, May is National Military Appreciation Month.

If it had been a paid job, the tab would have come to between $6,600 and $7,000, he said.

“These gentlemen all volunteered their time,” he said on Wednesday morning, watching as the crew bent copper piping, hooked up connections in the attic, replaced the compressor and air handler, and made short work of the project. “Most of the company wanted to be here to help with this.

“We were glad to get the chance to do this,” said Huddleston. “I don’t know who’s more grateful — us or him.”

Fuller said his group spends much of its efforts explaining to area military veterans what benefits are available to them through the Veterans Health Administration, but this was not an expense it would cover.

“I never believed anyone would do this for us,"" Oliver Marcelli said. ""I can’t thank them enough.”

Oliver and Mary Marcelli pose for a portrait in their house in Naples Park on Wednesday, May 1, 2019.

(Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

In the Pacific War from the beginning, Marcelli participated in the invasion of island after island, from Guadalcanal and Tulagi to Peleliu, where he was wounded in an artillery attack and earned a Purple Heart. Also suffering from malaria, he was sent back to the States.

After a career with Ballantine & Sons Beer, Marcelli and his wife retired to Naples around 1979, building the home in Naples Park where they still live.

“There was nothing but trees around us then,” he said. “We’ve seen a lot of changes.""

489,Volusia sheriff plans to step up patrols at houses of worship,"VOLUSIA COUNTY, Fla. - The recent attacks on places of worship has Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood stepping up patrols, whether people are there or not.

The sheriff believes it's the first step to protecting innocent people who gather to pray.

""The two safest places in America were always church and school, and yet they have now become slaughterhouses,"" Chitwood said. ""If there's a service going on, I want my deputies to stop in and at least stay for a couple of minutes. Let the congregation know, 'Hey we got our eyes on you. We're going to keep you safe.'""

Chitwood said the second part in keeping congregants safe is to have religious leaders pick trained and licensed people to carry guns.

""Our position is, you have responsible members of your congregation, why not -- if you already haven't --arm them. We'll help train you, we'll help look at your facility and help you target harden your facility,"" he said.

Allen Chapel in Daytona Beach took the sheriff's advice after the church shooting in South Carolina. The congregation has a security plan in place and the sheriff said it's one of the safest religious buildings in Volusia County.

""No matter what the function is there, Bible study, Sunday service, whatever. There's always somebody that's always armed,"" Chitwood said.

Gloria Max, the executive director of the Jewish Federation of Volusia & Flagler Counties, supports Chitwood's strategy.

She believes there should be armed congregants in every religious institution, including her own, which she attends regularly.

""These are different times. You have to be realistic and I think that there should be teams of people that the rabbi knows and the board knows that they carry concealed weapons,"" Max said.

Max was preparing for Wednesday night's community-wide Holocaust Memorial Observance, which Chitwood said will have extra security. Max said she's grateful for their presence but believes it's time for everyone to be proactive.

""A lot of people think it'll go away, it won't be there, but the more it is, the more it happens. We have to pay attention, we have to stand up and say, 'no more,'"" she said.

Take a deep breath while walking through the rows of trees, and you'll know these are the real deal. The enticing fragrance of peaches hangs over the orchard like a light, spring wrap. Velvet orbs pull branches downward, making it easy to reach up and grab one, or three.

In addition to growing and selling this sweet gift from nature more closely associated Georgia, the Edisons want to educate people about how peach farming took hold in Florida.

To produce fruit, peach trees require extended cold weather, a time when they can rest for the growing season. Traditional varieties can require up to 1,000 chill hours with temperatures below 45 degrees.

So no, peaches weren't grown in this part of Florida until the University of Florida began developing low-chill varieties in the 1960s. Most of the Edisons' Dear Park Peaches are the UFSun variety, though they experiment with others.

""We need 100 chill hours,"" Alise said. ""We need 100 hours at 45 degrees or less, and we need it more or less between Thanksgiving and January.""

Ken and Alise bought the 160-acre commercial orange grove in 1999. Before that, they lived in Melbourne, where they ran Edison Electrical Service.

They started out farming citrus.

""Most of the juice oranges wind up in the Tropicana plant in Fort Pierce,"" Alise said.

Then freezes in 2009, 2010 and 2011 wreaked havoc on their orange crops.

""One area was so devastated, we said, 'Let's give up,'"" she said. ""That's when we got into peaches.""

They put 660 peach trees on seven acres in 2011, and the trees grew fast. Their first crop was ripening nicely in 2013, when they lost everything to a March freeze. Farming is a fickle business.

The next year, the crop rebounded, and has been going strong since.

Though smaller than other peaches, Florida varieties ripen in late April and May, weeks earlier than their cousins to the north.

""They're starting to size,"" Ken said, examining one of the branches. ""We got that inch of rain...""

They get bigger as the season progresses.

The Edisons sell peaches commercially, and because they ripen on the tree, they're distributed to nearby places like Lucky's Market in West Melbourne, Downtown Produce in Melbourne and the Produce Place in Suntree.

On a Tuesday afternoon, the farm is serene, with a spring breeze ruffling the leaves on the fruit-laden branches.

Crowds of in-the-know folks come out on weekends when the peach groves are open for self-picking. Saturdays and Sundays bring out families and couples and U-Pickers of all ages. Cars line the quarter-mile lane leading from the house to the grove.

From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and from noon to 4 p.m. Sunday, the Edisons bring their kids in to help for a few hours and pass out buckets and basic instructions (watch your step, make sure there is no green on the fruit, don't go past the yellow tape).

Peaches go for $3 per pound, and each bucket holds about 10 pounds.

Ken said they should have peaches through the end of May, but recommends people watch the farm's Facebook page for updates.

Alise loves to see people make peach picking an event.

The couple added a shelter with tables and added a restroom to the grove. They sell soft drinks and water, as well as boiled peanuts, fresh eggs and honey from nearby hives.

They encourage visitors to bring a picnic and sit under the trees. In the six years they've been selling peaches, she's seen families make it an annual trip. Alise has watched children grow up.

""That's the kind of thing you can't put a price tag on, to see people enjoy something we've worked so hard on,"" she said.

""So yes, we can grow peaches in Florida.""

499,Florida woman accused of pointing gun at victim after she wouldn't turn right at red light,"The suspect was charged with two counts of aggravated assault.

BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. - A 51-year-old Cocoa woman is accused of pointing a gun at another woman after the victim would not turn right at a red light, according to an arrest report from the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office.

Penny Herndon was charged with two counts of aggravated assault.

On March 2, the victim was driving west on Highway 50 in Titusville and stopped at a red light.

The victim was going to merge onto Interstate 95, according to the arrest report.

The woman told investigators she saw a black van stop behind her.

The driver of the van started to honk the horn despite the light still being red, according to the report.

The arrest report shows the victim was unable to merge onto Interstate 95.

The light eventually turned green and both drivers moved onto the on-ramp of the interstate.

The driver of the black van followed closely behind the victim, according to the report.

Investigators said the victim told the sheriff’s office she changed lanes to allow the black van to pass her.

The black van passed her and changed lanes to get in front of her, according to the report.

The report shows the victim had to hit the brakes so she would not hit the van.

The victim said the driver of the van changed lanes to be parallel with her.

The sheriff’s office said the victim told investigators the suspect held a gun and pointed it at the victim’s car.

This caused the victim to hit her brakes and the van drove away.

The victim told investigators the gun looked like a semiautomatic type pistol with a silver or gray barrel and black handle grip.

The man sitting in the passenger seat confirmed her story to investigators.

The victim was able to give the sheriff’s office the license plate description.

The car was registered to Jerry True.

True told investigators his stepdaughter Penny Herndon was driving the van earlier.

Investigators later met with Herndon about the victim’s accusation.

Deputies said Herndon told investigators she was involved in a road rage incident, but she denied having a handgun or owning any guns.

She did tell investigators she owns a couple of pellet guns, according to the arrest report.

True told investigators his stepdaughter keeps a silver pellet gun in the van and uses it to chase raccoons away from her cats, according to the arrest report.

The victim was able to identify Herndon as the person who pointed the gun at her during a photo lineup.

The U.S. Open Pickleball Championships are a win for Collier County.

The county has won economically and socially from the event.

The championships, held at the East Naples Community Park, are bigger than ever this year, with more players and more spectators.

Events kicked off April 27 and run through Saturday, May 4. This year they've drawn a field of 2,161 players from 46 states and 15 countries.

More than 10,000 fans will attend to cheer on some of the best players in the world.

""It has put us on the map internationally because this is the U.S. Open,"" said Collier County Commissioner Penny Taylor. ""It has given us the impetus to build a facility that is just a first-class facility in a part of our town that basically was asleep. We are so grateful to pickleball.""

While the county has made big investments in pickleball, Taylor said they've paid off in spades.

""As much as we have given them, they have given back to us. The leadership is just extraordinary. We couldn't ask for better leadership,"" Taylor said.

In its first contract with the county, Spirit Promotions, the organizing group, agreed to hold the championships annually at East Naples Community Park for three years through 2018. The county eagerly extended that hosting agreement another three years through 2021.

""We forged a relationship that we look forward to renewing year after year after year,"" Taylor said.

While competition is fierce, the mood is festive at the championships. In fact, the event has been labeled the ""biggest pickleball party in the world,"" offering a fun atmosphere with food, drinks and entertainment every day.

""We want to be the pickleball capital of the world,"" Taylor said. ""We'd love it.""

East Naples Community Park now has 58 pickleball courts, with 54 of them configured for use in the tournament, plus the Zing Zang Championship Court, where high-visibility matches are played. All courts were recently upgraded through the county's Parks and Recreation Department.

""It's growing, and we've made a commitment as a county to keep up with pickleball, and we're better for it,"" Taylor said.

The county has not only invested in more pickleball courts, it also has spent hundreds of thousands of tourist tax dollars since their inaugural year in 2016 to help promote the championships. In the last sponsorship contract, the county agreed to spend $345,000 on marketing for the event over three years.

""It's really not the birth of pickleball here,"" Taylor said. ""It's really the birth of the U.S. Open that Collier County has witnessed and been part of — and that's the exciting part. We didn't do it, but we opened our arms to it, so it's something to be very proud of.""

Pickleball hasn't just brought thousands of visitors to Collier County, she said, it has brought the community closer together, with more than 600 volunteers stepping up to help out with the U.S. Open championships this year.

The sport and the championships have also improved the quality of life in the community, offering a new way to socialize and stay healthy, Taylor said.

""It's healthy,"" she said. ""It's a wonderfully social game. It's an athletic game and it's something that is a lifelong game. That is what is so important. You have generations playing pickleball.""

A sport for all ages

The field of players at this year's U.S. Open is a mixture of professionals and amateurs. The oldest registered player is 86, while the youngest is 10, showing why it's considered a sport for all ages.

Some well-known sports personalities signed up to play in this year’s tournament including Hank Haney, who coached golf great Tiger Woods early in his career, and Rich Cho, vice president of basketball strategy for the Memphis Grizzlies.

CBS Sports Network will film the Pro Finals on Saturday for coverage that will air at 7 p.m. May 24. SiriusXM’s Radio Margaritaville will broadcast live from the event on Saturday.

Minto Communities has been the title sponsor for the championships from the start. The developer's Isles of Collier Preserve is around the corner from the tournament's headquarters, and the active lifestyle community has benefited from the event, with players and spectators booking appointments to view what it offers while they're in town, said Bill Bullock, president of Minto's Latitude Margaritaville retirement communities.

Those tours have led to sales, but Bullock didn't say how many.

This year, he said, Minto offered up a few of its pickleball courts in Isles of Collier Preserve for U.S. Open events, giving participants and their fans another way to experience the community.

""We're definitely engaged with the sport,"" Bullock said.

The championships also offers Minto the opportunity to market its Latitude Margaritaville retirement communities in Florida and elsewhere, inspired by the music and lifestyle of legendary musician Jimmy Buffett.

Minto hosted its annual Margaritaville Party in the Park event last weekend, with live music, food and free admission to watch professional players warming up throughout the day on the Zing Zang Championship Court at East Naples Community Park. The developer's involvement in the championships gives it global exposure.

""It's worldwide at this point,"" Bullock said. ""You have people from all over the U.S. and the world coming to Naples and seeing what a great place it is to visit and live.""

There are many local sponsors for the pickleball championships, including North Naples-based medical device manufacturer Arthrex.

“As a leader in sports medicine innovation, Arthrex is pleased to support the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships in Naples. The premier sporting event brings a positive economic impact to the area and aligns with Arthrex’s overall commitment to the health and well-being of our community,"" said Lisa Gardiner, the company's communications manager, in an email.

Good timing as winter season winds down

Athletes and attendees alike have filled hotel rooms and RV parks. They'll eat, shop and visit attractions while they're here, giving the local economy a boost on what the hotel industry refers to as ""need dates,"" when business is winding down from the busy winter season.

Last year, the tournament had a total economic impact of $4.5 million. It generated more than 9,400 room nights, making it one of the county's top sporting events.

With more spectators and participants this year, the event is expected to be an even bigger boon for the county, generating visitor spending throughout the community.

""We are the pickleball capital of the world this week and year round, and we plan to stay number one for many years to come,"" said Jack Wert, Collier County's tourism director, in an email.

Dan Sullivan, director of sales and marketing for GreenLinks Golf Villas at Lely Resort, said his property is sold out for the week because of the tournament, with many players and spectators staying for seven days or longer.

CLOSE Playing it safe when it comes to Pickleball.

The villas offer one- and two-bedroom condos with full kitchens 5½ miles from the tournament's headquarters.

""We hit all the right demographics,"" Sullivan said. ""We are in the right time. We are in the right place. We have the right accommodations.""

At GreenLinks, this year's tournament generated about 350 room nights.

""For a small property like ours, it's the No. 1 generator throughout the year,"" Sullivan said. ""It's the biggest thing the whole year.""

While the success of the tournament may have been a surprise the first year, it's not anymore, after seeing the magic that surrounds it, he said.

""Even the amateur players are fun to watch, never mind the pros,"" Sullivan said. ""The pros, that's another game altogether. The excitement that happens there. It's just fun to watch people play.""

Corporate backing a sign of success

Another sign of tournament's success? Big corporate sponsors.

""When you have all the big dogs, Head and Wilson and the other guys as corporate sponsors, you know things are happening,"" Sullivan said.

Some of the representatives for corporate sponsors are staying at GreenLinks too.

""They are sponsoring the pros. They are doing outreach into the community. They are doing all that stuff to promote themselves,"" Sullivan said.

Many of the players and spectators staying at GreenLinks plan to return in 2020 and will book their rooms before they leave to go back home, to ensure they secure a spot. The property usually fills up months ahead of the tournament, Sullivan said.

The organizers do a great job of promoting the event and Naples at the same time, he said.

""Certainly, you can't discount the effect Minto has had on this,"" he said. ""They have just been spectacular as far as that's concerned.""

Mary Shea, a former president of the Sports Council of Collier County and the general manager for the WoodSpring Suites near Collier Boulevard and Interstate 75, said her extended-stay property opened too late to capture much business from the pickleball championships this year. By the time the hotel opened in March, most players and fans had already booked elsewhere, she said.

""We have a couple that is actually playing in the tournament, and they've been with us for two weeks,"" she said. ""It's really good business for Collier County.""

The couple came from Montreal. As a volunteer for the tournament, Shea said she's met players and spectators from around the world.

""It has been really nice watching such a great success story,"" she said. ""It has been a fun journey.""

When she met the event's organizers the first time, Shea said she didn't even know what pickleball was and had to ask. The game is a cross between tennis, badminton and ping-pong.

Exceeding promoter’s expectations

Terri Graham and Chris Evon formed Spirit Promotions LLC in 2015 to create and run what they hoped would become the premier pickleball tournament in the world. By the looks of it, they've more than succeeded.

""It's definitely exceeded our expectations,"" Graham said.

The first year, she said, the event drew 825 participants and about 2,000 spectators. Four years later, those numbers seem so small.

""We never, ever expected to have over 2,000 players,"" Graham said.

What's made the event so popular?

""One, it's a great event,"" Graham said. ""People have a lot of fun here. The other thing is it's coming to paradise, when it's still really cold and snowy up north.""

2018: Pickleball means more to Naples than U.S. Open

The hundreds of volunteers, who take pride in the event, she said, are ""pretty much the backbone"" of the tournament.

""Every single one of them wants the people who come here to have a great time,"" Graham said.

The event is somewhat unique, she said, in that it draws more spectators than players. About 70 percent of the attendees come from out of town.

""People come to just watch and party and go to the beach, and shop on Fifth Avenue and have a vacation,"" Graham said.

She said she can't think of a better place to have the tournament.

""This is the pickleball capital of the world, Naples is,"" Graham said. ""Yes, we envision it staying here.""

INDIAN ROCKS BEACH, Fla. (WFLA) – Three people, including two off-duty Philadelphia police officers, were arrested following a domestic dispute and scuffle with a Pinellas deputy in Indian Rocks Beach on Tuesday.

Deputies were dispatched to the Crabby Bill’s restaurant on Gulf Boulevard after a complaint of a domestic battery that occurred at the business.

When deputies arrived, a witness said a man, later identified as Paul Seeger, 55, pushed a woman, identified as Cindy Caine, 44.

The deputy could see Seeger and Caine arguing near the intersection of 4th Avenue and 1st Street.

The couple walked away from the deputy and he approached them and called out.

Deputies said Seeger refused to stop and continued walking away after being given multiple warnings to stop.

The deputy grabbed Seeger’s arm and he resisted. Caine pushed the deputy’s arm away.

While trying to stop Seeger, a third man, Frank Bonett, 44, approached the deputy and started making threats.

Bonett removed his shirt, clinched his fists and shouted profanities at the deputy, advancing at him after being told numerous times to stay away.

Deputies said Seeger and Bonett approached the deputy in a hostile manner.

The deputy deployed his Taser at Seeger, but it was ineffective.

The deputy took down Seeger to the ground and a violent struggle ensued.

Seeger was eventually handcuff and taken into custody.

Bonett and Caine were also taken into custody.

Caine and Seeger are husband and wife. They were both uncooperative with the investigation.

Deputies believe alcohol was a factor in the case.

Caine, a police officer for the Philadelphia Police Department, was charged with one count of battery on a law enforcement officer.

Bonett, also a Philadelphia Police Department officer, was charged with one count of assault on a law enforcement officer.

Seeger, a retired Philadelphia officer, was charged with one count of domestic battery and one count of resisting an officer with violence.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/2-philadelphia-police-officers-arrested-following-domestic-dispute-in-indian-rocks-beach/1971386492,2019-05-02T00:00:50Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
518,"Mako shark, great white shark ping off the coast of Melbourne a day apart","CLOSE Spend a day aboard the M/V Ocearch as the team and scientists hunt sharks along the Florida coastline. Craig Bailey, Wochit

Hello, Yinzer!

At 8:23 a.m. Wednesday, the 6-foot, 10-inch-long mako shark pinged hundreds of miles off the coast of Melbourne. And it's the first time the 255-pound shark pinged here, according to its track record on Ocearch. Previous pings show Yinzer typically hangs out off the coast of North Carolina, Virginia and Massachusetts.

Ocearch tweeted April 30, hours before the shark pinged: ""While many of the white sharks we’re tracking are headed north, mako shark Yinzer is headed south. He’s moving into new territory we’ve never tracked him in before.""

Yinzer was tagged in November 2017 off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, by researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution aboard the MV Machaca, Ocearch says on its site. Its bio shows the male shark was named by the Mandella family, avid shark followers fluent in ""Pittsburghese.""

The mako shark was not the only shark to ping in Brevard this week.

A few days before May, Miss May made her presence known — her pings were hundreds of miles closer to Melbourne. The 10-foot-long great white shark surfaced off the coast on Tuesday.

""Since we tagged her a couple months ago, she has swum a huge lap around the southern half of the NASFA region,"" OCEARCH said on Twitter.

The 10-foot, 2-inch-long great white has been hanging around the Melbourne coast (miles and miles away, of course), pinging at 8:13 p.m. April 29, then 6:51 and 8:11 p.m. April 30. Before Miss May's ping in Melbourne, the shark pinged off the coast of Canaveral National Seashore near Scottsmoor at 6:21 p.m. April 26.

Before this week, it's been a while since Miss May pinged off the Space Coast. The shark last pinged here in February.

According to OCEARCH, the shark was tagged Feb. 15 off Fernandina Beach and named after Mayport. The shark advocacy group will eventually be based in Mayport at a joint Jacksonville University and OCEARCH facility.

Denver startup Atomos Nuclear and Space — which is developing electric-propulsion ""space tugs"" to move satellites into varying orbits — flew cross-country to Melbourne and claimed Tuesday's $100,000 Rise of the Rest pitch competition.

But look for Atomos to return — to try to establish a presence on Cape Canaveral.

""Besides launch, we don’t have integration facilities. We don’t have access to the resources that there are in Florida,"" Clark said.

""So we definitely want to come back. We definitely want to talk about how to partner,"" she said.

Tuesday's Space Coast event was the 40th city visited by Rise of the Rest, which showcases startup ecosystems across America that are far removed from Silicon Valley, Austin, Boston and other established hubs.

A $150 million seed fund launched in December by Revolution, a Washington, D.C. venture capital firm, finances the campaign — which was featured by ""60 Minutes"" last month. The firm is headed by Case and ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author J.D. Vance.

Clark's successful pitch topped seven rival companies, including three from the Space Coast:

• BoMax Hydrogen (Space Coast), which is developing a carbon-free, light-driven method to produce hydrogen to generate electricity.

• Helicon Chemical Co. (Space Coast), which develops next-generation rocket fuel for the military and commercial space industries.

• Hermeus (Atlanta, Georgia), which engineers and manufactures Mach 5 aircraft.

• Hydrosat (Washington, D.C.), which specializes in satellite imagery data for the agriculture industry.

• Indemnis (Anchorage, Alaska), which develops and manufactures parachute recovery systems for drones.

• Reaction Dynamics (Montreal, Quebec), which develops space transportation systems for launch providers.

• Tomahawk Robotics (Space Coast), which provides control software for robots.

Groundswell Startups: AOL co-founder Steve Case to host $100,000 tech startup pitch contest in Melbourne

The event drew an estimated crowd of 350 to Groundswell Startups, the Melbourne tech incubator on U.S. 1.

Rise of the Rest is in the midst of a Florida road trip featuring $100,000 pitch contests that kicked off Monday in Orlando. The organization's signature red bus will visit Tampa on Wednesday, Miami on Thursday, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Friday.

While judging Tuesday's pitch contest, Case said Vance told him the Space Coast field ""may have been the best set of entrepreneurs, the best pitches he's ever seen.""

Earlier Tuesday, Rise of the Rest toured the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Blue Origin, OneWeb Satellites, Rocket Crafters, Embraer and the Florida Institute of Technology's Digital Scholarship Laboratory.

""This is a region that has done some of the most innovative things ever. Putting a man on the moon was crazy to even try,"" Case told the Groundswell crowd during a fireside chat.

The billionaire likened the $100,000 venture capital investment with a ""booster rocket"" that can accelerate a startup's development.

""We have no idea which cities will rise the fastest. We don't know if it's Melbourne. We don't know if it's Des Moines. We don't know if it's Minneapolis. We really don't know. And the reason we don't know has nothing do to what we do — and everything to do what you do,"" Case said, challenging the crowd.

""Grab this opportunity and seize it as a moment to say, 'Let's figure out a way to become even more of a startup city. Be more focused on innovation. Welcome the risk-taking,'"" Case said.

""Because this is a region that clearly, based on its storied history, has the potential for an extremely bright future,"" he said.

During her pitch, Clark said Atomos is developing space tugs — or electric-propulsion powered spacecraft designed to move satellites — that may someday serve as ""connecting flights"" in Earth's orbit. She said Atomos could position satellites from telecommunications companies and other customers 30 percent cheaper and 50 percent faster than traditional rockets.

""Rockets no longer need to go all the way to a specific orbit for a specific satellite. With space tugs, they can transport all satellites to a dropping point. And we'll take them from there,"" Clark said.

Atomos hopes to launch its first vehicle into space in 2021.

Axios Managing Editor Kim Hart moderated the 45-minute fireside chat with Case and Vance, who criticized the Silicon Valley mindset.

""Wouldn't you rather be focused on well, quite literally, the stars — and not on the next dog walking app? I mean, that seems to be like a pretty easy and straightforward proposition,"" Vance said.

521,Battle brewing over housing in Eustis for farmworkers,"EUSTIS, Fla. - More than 100 residents are expected to turn out Wednesday morning to protest a plan to build a large housing complex near Eustis for farmworkers

The project, proposed by the company Liner Source, calls for a 46,000 square-foot building to be built near the intersection of County Road 44A and Calhoun Road.

According to the documents it filled with Lake County, the company wants to be able to house up to 196 farmworkers at any given time.

The building would be built just 300 feet away from Stephanie Luke's home.

""Our biggest concern, actually, is the safety of our children,"" she said. ""They are in my backyard, and we’re talking about 196 people that I don’t know anything about.""

According to filing documents, Liner Source proposed the building would be secured with a ""full time housing manager"" and a ""security command.""

""The business owners continue to say, 'We live here. We’re part of this community, too.' They do not live here,"" Luke said. ""Their house is not adjacent to any of the properties that we're speaking about right now.""

News 6 contacted Liner Source and its consulting firm, LPG Urban and Regional Planners, to ask them about the neighbors' concerns.

So far, they have not responded.

Luke said she's spoken with many of her neighbors, and they want to make sure the Planning and Zoning Commission hears their concerns.

""This isn't just a couple people we're talking about. This is hundreds that are going to show up, hopefully, at this meeting and voice their concerns,"" she said.

The Lake County Planning and Zoning Commission meets on Wednesday at 9 a.m. at the Lake County Administration Building in Tavares.

536,Vero Beach City Council to discuss hiring full-time city manager from within city staff,"Buy Photo Vero Beach City Council could consider promoting Interim City Manager Monte Falls next week. (Photo: SAM WOLFE/TCPALM)

VERO BEACH — City Council could decide to bypass its city manager search consultant by promoting from within.

Councilman Harry Howle is proposing Council hire Interim City Manager Monte Falls as the full-time city manager. Council is scheduled to consider the idea at Tuesday's council meeting.

""I honestly think he's the best man for the job,"" Howle said Thursday.

Falls, 61, was named to the interim position in March to temporarily lead city operations when Jim O'Connor retired. More than 70 people have applied for the position.

Council has been scheduled to name finalists for the position later this month, but Howe said the city could suspend its search early.

Falls, who has worked for the city for about 28 years, including 15 as director of public works, did not apply for the position. Falls was hesitant at first because he did not have a pleasant experience when he previously served as interim city manager in 2010. This time, however, was different, he said.

""I think all the council members have been happy with the job I've been doing,"" Falls said. ""I've got a good relationship with all of them.""

Falls has lived in Vero Beach since 1981. He met his wife, Michele, a Vero Beach High School graduate, at North Carolina State University, and the couple decided to move to her hometown.

Falls already is familiar with operations, staff as well as the issues facing the city, Howle said.

""How can you do better?"" he said.

At first, hiring Falls did not occur to Mayor Val Zudans because Falls hadn't applied for the position.

""I think Monte Falls has done a great job as interim city manager and is perfectly capable of being the full-time city manager,"" he said. ""I'm more than willing to discuss it.""

537,Cape Coral's first LEGO brick experience coming May 4,"Saturday's event will feature a variety of activities, including a “My Own Creation” contest for all ages, a DUPLO play area for children ages two to five, a vehicle build and race event, collectible minifigure trading, and lots of creative play. (Photo: USA Today Handout)

Bryan Maike’s love affair with LEGOs is something he’s happy to admit to, but more importantly, the passion the 45-year-old father of three has for the popular plastic bricks is something he now wants others to benefit from.

Broke4Bricks, a nonprofit organization Maike and his wife Katie started, is hosting Cape Coral’s first LEGO brick experience on Saturday at Gulf Middle School. Proceeds will benefit autism awareness. Entry to the event is free and includes interactive LEGO brick activities for all ages.

“I never stopped playing with LEGOs,” said Maike, who has amassed a LEGO collection of more than 3,000 complete sets and more than 10,000 minifigures that totals over 1 million pieces.

His collection, valued at $100,000, is stored in a climate-controlled building.

“Investing in LEGOs is better than gold,” he said, although that is not the reason for his collection.

Maike said the mission of Broke4Bricks is to use LEGO as a medium “to enhance social, academic and creative skills in this generation of children and those to follow.”

Maike is a home builder. Katie is a psychology teacher at Lehigh Senior High School.

They have shared the LEGOs previously with Boys & Girls Clubs. Both are long-time residents of Cape Coral.

It was the interests of Maike and Katie that fueled the idea for Saturday’s event.

Maike calls himself an AFOL or Adult Fan of LEGOs. Katie is interested in how LEGOs can be used as a learning tool, especially with kids who are atypical learners.

“My wife’s passion is alternative learners, so we combined our interests,” Maike said.

The two have attended various AFOL events and have researched fun activities to bring to their LEGO events. Maike built two racing ramps and ordered another one that will arrive just in time for the event.

They have had six weeks to prepare and plan this event. The date was chosen to coincide with “May the 4th be with you,” LEGO's campaign to promote its Star Wars sets. This is the 20th year LEGO has been selling Star Wars sets, some of which will be on display at Bricks on the Cape.

The event will feature a variety of activities, including a “My Own Creation” contest for all ages, a DUPLO play area for children ages 2 to 5, a vehicle build and race event, collectible minifigure trading, and lots of creative play. Maike said they are working with a 4,000 square foot space at Gulf Middle School.

“The attractions are geared to different age groups,” he said. “We're hoping they fall into their slots organically and the parents will know what is more their speed.”

Another feature of the event will be a missing parts center. Participants can bring incomplete sets and Maike will help with research and possibly find a replacement at a low cost.

“A lot of times kids try to find a piece and we'll be selling the pieces,” Maike said. “There are some rare colors and common colors. The average price is 2 to 5 cents. The majority of small pieces are fairly inexpensive.”

There will also be an area for people to bring their own minifigures and trade them.

Donations will be accepted at the event and there will be raffles to help support the fund-raising efforts. Maike will sell VIP gift bags with goodies and gift cards for $25. A Go Fund Me has been set up with a goal to raise $2,500 to cover costs.

Maike said he hopes to see this particular event grow and there may be other events in the future. He mentioned a possible brick tower event for Halloween and monthly events.

There is no debating the popularity of LEGOs with young and old, in Cape Coral and around the globe.

“It's inexplicable really,” Maike said. “The creativity that you can build with … the endless possibilities of your imagination.”

540,Sanford exploring new modes of transportation like water taxi,"- The city of Sanford is growing, but the parking isn’t keeping up. That’s why the city is looking to new modes of transportation - even a water taxi - to get folks to Sanford.

Downtown Sanford has a lot to offer from restaurants, bars and specialty shops.

“It is absolutely popping,” Jeanine Taylor, owner of Jeanine Taylor Folk Art said.

There are already alternative options for getting around town from SunRail, Amtrak, the Sanford trolley and biking. But city leaders have a bigger vision of a community that thrives without needing to drive.

“There’s multiple problems having everyone drive by themselves downtown,” said Ginger Hoke, senior project manager at Neel-Schaffer Inc. “You have parking problems, congestion problems, traffic problems.”

That problem is now inspiration.

“SunRail isn’t open on the weekends,” Hoke said. “Sanford is a destination city and pretty lively on the weekends, so we need people to be able to get here more easily.”

A new study from the consulting firm Neel-Schaffer, is laying out the plan for Sanford that would include a water taxi service to transport visitors from Volusia County across Lake Monroe to downtown Sanford.

“I think it would be fun,” Colonial Room owner Michelle Simoneaux said.

Nearby businesses like the Colonial Room restaurant said their customers sometimes struggle to find parking on weekends and like the idea of new foot traffic coming from across the lake.

“Especially since we’re just a couple blocks away from the river,” Simoneaux said.

“I mean what better mode of transportation!” Taylor said. “How many communities are on the St. John River?”

City officials said a water taxi may be a few years down the road since it would require approval from state and federal agencies – even the US Coast Guard.

It will all be part of a bigger plan that will be presented to Sanford leaders along with more bike racks, golf cart zones, wider sidewalks and designated drop-off zones for ride sharing.

“It’s just wonderful to see people discovering Sanford and not just discovering it – but coming here again and again and again,” Taylor said. “They really love the shops and restaurants.”",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/sanford-exploring-new-modes-of-transportation-like-water-taxi,2019-05-01T16:55:26Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
542,Brevard County deputy fired after getting shot in Jacksonville post-rodeo brawl,"For the second time in just over a year, a decorated deputy has been fired by Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey after being involved in shooting incident while off duty.

In the latest incident, Deputy Jason Roberts — credited by the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office in January for his role in a multi-agency investigation of an overdose death — faced potential criminal charges after he was shot and wounded in February in a Jacksonville hotel room.

Deputy Jason Roberts (Photo: Provided by Brevard County Sheriff's Office)

Records obtained by FLORIDA TODAY Tuesday show that Ivey fired Roberts after an administrative investigation found the deputy ""operated outside the boundaries"" of department rules.

“The investigation was initiated over concerns that you failed to adhere to established agency policies,” Ivey wrote in the memo. “…specifically that while off-duty and visiting Jacksonville, Florida, you were intoxicated and physically attacked another guest of a hotel. The victim then armed himself with a handgun and shot you in self-defense to stop the alleged unprovoked attack,” wrote Ivey, who said Roberts also refused to cooperate with the investigation.

Roberts was off duty, attending a rodeo in Jacksonville, with his fiancee, who used to work for the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office as a community services specialist, when he was shot several times by a motorcycle club member the couple had met hours earlier.

More: Authorities reviewing how federal inmate was released from Brevard County jail

The Duval County state attorney's office declined to prosecute either the shooter — described as ""shaken"" by the incident — or Roberts, who agents said attacked the shooter.

""Although there is probable cause to bring charges against Roberts for striking (the shooter), proving this case beyond a reasonable doubt may prove challenging although certainly not impossible,"" Assistant State Attorney Joseph Licandro wrote in an assessment of the case. ""Ultimately, the state will respect (the shooter's) wishes that charges not be pursued in this matter,"" Licandro wrote.

At the time of the shooting, the Sheriff's Office would not release the deputy's name or confirm that he was involved in the incident. In subsequent weeks, the Sheriff's Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Space Coast Daily, a Brevard County-based online publication often used by the Sheriff's Office to break news, first reported Roberts dismissal on Monday. Sheriff Ivey often writes reports for the publication. FLORIDA TODAY previously filed multiple public records requests to get the the information, which was released to other media Tuesday.

THE SHOOTING

The Jacksonville shooting took place on Feb. 17 at the Lexington Hotel. Duval County Sheriff’s investigators reported that Roberts and his fiancee had met a Michael Donn of Georgia, a member of the #1 Stunnas Motor Sport Club, a motorcycle group

Roberts, his fiancee, and Donn at some point decided to go back to the hotel with a bottle of cognac, reports show. Donn told investigators that Roberts had talked to him about ""moving"" kilos of narcotics, reports show.

At some point, according to the reports, Roberts' fiancee locked herself in the hotel room bathroom, prompting Roberts to try to kick down the door. Donn attempted to calm Roberts, who responded by hitting him, reports show. Investigators said Roberts grabbed his fiancee when Donn attempted to intervene and help her.

Roberts and Donn struggled for a moment when Donn reached for his own handgun. Roberts was quoted as saying, “You ain’t going to do nothing. I’m going to destroy you.”

Donn, investigators said, feared for his life and fired a shot. The biker fired two more times after Roberts jumped at him, throwing punches.

Local deputies arrived and found blood along the walls, several shell casings and a tooth on the floor.

""Call 911, I just shot a guy,"" the biker was heard saying, the report shows. A woman with Donn's motorcycle club attempted to help Roberts as he lie wounded.

Roberts was rushed to the University of Florida Shands hospital. Jacksonville authorities then notified the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office. Todd Goodyear, BCSO spokesman, would not confirm local reports that Sheriff Ivey and senior staff members traveled to Jacksonville in response to the shooting.

Roberts was hired by the agency in 2009. He was part of drug trafficking investigation in 2018 that began with the discovery of a woman’s body in a Melbourne ditch. Agents — including Roberts — led to the arrest of a suspect on federal charges. In January, the sheriff’s office recognized Roberts with a meritorious service award for his work on the case.

A 'PATTERN OF SUBSTANDARD BEHAVIOR'

In his memo, Ivey wrote that Roberts appeared to have a ""documented pattern of substandard behavior."" Records show nine separate instances where Roberts was given letters of reprimand or written counseling for department violations ranging from intoxication on and off duty, substandard performance in several cases.

Another former deputy Nick Worthy was fired by Ivey in March 2018, after Worthy's neighbors reported hearing gunshots and a woman's scream come from Worthy's home. Deputies arrived to find Worthy's 2-year-old child living in squalid conditions, along with small amounts of cocaine and marijuana.

Worthy, 29, and his girlfriend, Rachel Trexler, 32, were charged with two felonies, including child neglect without great bodily harm and possession of cocaine.

Worthy had been named law enforcement of the year in 2016, but, following his arrest and dismissal it emerged that he too had several reprimands and patterns of behavior not consistent with agency rules, records show.

Roberts has the right to appeal the sheriff's decision.

AUGUSTINE, Fla. - A woman and her boyfriend were taken into custody after the couple coordinated a home invasion robbery in St. Augustine, during which the victim was struck multiple times with a hammer, according to the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office.

Investigators said Jade Buck, 21, arranged to meet a man at his home who paid Buck $60 in exchange for sex. After receiving the money, Buck and the man got into a fight and Buck signaled two accomplices to come into the home, one of whom was Buck’s boyfriend, Francisco Valdez, 30.

At some point, the Sheriff’s Office said, the man was struck in his head numerous times with a hammer. Buck and Valdez then removed the man’s clothing, taking his cellphone and money.

Buck told investigators that Valdez planned the robbery, the Sheriff's Office said. She said Valdez brought the hammer and repeatedly struck the man in the head.

Buck and Valdez were charged with aggravated battery and robbery.

547,"Florida State softball focused on learning, not losses during slump","CLOSE The Seminoles were held to two hits and were 0 for 10 with runners on base. Curt Weiler, Tallahassee Democrat

Lonni Alameda knew a stretch like this was coming.

Alameda's Florida State softball team lost for the fifth time in its last seven games in a 4-0 defeat at the hands of the No. 6 Florida Gators Wednesday evening at JoAnne Graf Field.

After the No. 4 Seminoles (38-8, 10-5 in ACC) won 36 of their first 39 games this season, they've had a vulnerable few weeks entering this weekend's home series against Boston College (15-25, 4-11 in ACC) beginning Friday at 6 p.m.

Alameda knew it was only a matter of when not if this slump was coming after the Seminoles' red-hot start.

""To start off like we started off, we were hot for that first month of February. It was crazy. We kept saying, 'It's coming. You can't sustain 60 games and 70 games. It's coming.' Florida had it before we played them down there and then they turned it around,"" Alameda said after Wednesday's loss.

CLOSE Sherrill had both of FSU's hits as UF pitcher Kelly Barnhill largely neutralized the Seminoles' offense. Curt Weiler, Tallahassee Democrat

""You're going to go up and down weeks here and there. You've just got to make sure that your mental muscle can stay in shape and can handle it. That's where we're at right now. We'll have a good talk (Thursday) with the team, flush it and get after Boston College.""

The Seminoles were held to two hits -- both from sophomore infielder Sydney Sherrill -- in the loss to the Gators as UF pitcher Kelly Barnhill largely neutralized FSU's potent offense.

As they have after each loss this season, the Seminoles dwelled not on the end result but on what they can learn from the loss.

""We did lose, but as the little quote we like to say, 'There's always winners and learners, never winners and losers.' We're going to take a lot from that loss and move onto Boston College and try to bring back that energy and a little more fight,"" Sherrill said.

""I think it's just staying together and figuring out what we're doing wrong individually and as a team. Stay communicating and just keep bringing energy every game. It'll come back. We're a good team, we're a great team. We're going through these losses, but we learn from it and we'll come back strong.""

Alameda did see something of a different reaction after Wednesday's home loss in front of an announced crowd of 1,818 which was actually over 2,000 when counting the fans watching from the berm outside the stadium and the nearby parking garage.

""I love that they're feeling it a little bit right now like, 'Dang it, there was a good crowd out here, we wanted to get after it,'"" Alameda said.

""Now, it's time to move forward and get after BC.""

While FSU has struggled to find wins over the last few weeks, it's been right there in nearly every game.

Wednesday's loss was the first over the Seminoles' recent skid that came by more than two runs. Three of FSU's five losses over that span have been by a single run.

When FSU is finally able to come up on the right side of one of these close results, that could be just what the team needs to turn the tides back in the right direction.

""A lot of our games have been pretty close recently and we're just trying to keep fighting and get a win here and there,"" Sherrill said.

""I think (versus) Boston College, if we can just come out and try to come on top early in the game, that'll really help for the wins we need to get later in the season.""

Alameda isn't concerned about her team because she's quite aware of how the pendulum of momentum swings. She remembers well how it did for the Seminoles last season on their improbable run to the program's first NCAA Championship.

""That can be huge. Momentum is all about this game,"" Alameda said.

""Honestly, you want to peak at the right time.""

Some time at home could go a long way towards helping the Seminoles get back on track as well.

After a 10-game road trip which saw 23 days pass between FSU home games, Wednesday's game against the Gators was the first of seven straight home games as FSU closes out its home regular season slate.

""The first night I can't think how many kids were texting like I slept in my own bed and it was amazing. That'll help us,"" Alameda said.

""With our fans too and our stadium, it's just going to be so nice to be at home.""

In fact, FSU is likely to have to leave home just once more -- a three-game series at Syracuse to close out the regular season -- on its potential road back to the Women's College World Series in Oklahoma City.

FSU is set to host the ACC Tournament on its home field May 8 through 11 and remains likely to host an NCAA Tournament Regional and Super Regional.

""We're comfortable here and we're really excited for this weekend and these next couple weekends because we have been on the road a long time,"" Sherrill said.

""I think it'll be big for us to see what we can do these next two weekends here at home, bring a lot of energy and we'll have energy from our fanbase too, which is awesome.""

After the opening game against the Eagles Friday at 6 p.m., the two teams will close out the series Saturday at 1 p.m. and Sunday at noon.

548,Florida family grappling with cremation mystery,"""I am sitting here with someone else's ashes and my father's were in the bushes,"" Rolle said crying, her mother sitting quietly but stoically next to her. ""All I want is my father's ashes back and (make it so) whoever these belong to can get their remains.""

BOCA RATON — For six years, the family of Robert Nero Sr. thought his ashes sat in an urn on his widow's mantle. But the family recently learned that ashes and a metal disk identifying them as his were found dumped in bushes at a West Palm Beach YWCA and now they don't know what to believe.

Sitting beside the bronze urn in their lawyer's office Tuesday, Nero's widow, Corene, and his daughter, Gloria Nero Rolle, demanded to know if the ashes inside are Nero's or someone else's. They say they haven't gotten answers from Stevens Brothers Funeral Home, which handled the cremation.

""I am sitting here with someone else's ashes and my father's were in the bushes,"" Rolle said crying, her mother sitting quietly but stoically next to her. ""All I want is my father's ashes back and (make it so) whoever these belong to can get their remains.""

A man who answered the phone at Stevens Brothers told The Associated Press the Neroes have the proper ashes. He declined to give his name or make further comment.

The state's Division of Funeral, Cemetery and Consumer Services said in a statement Tuesday that it has just learned of the allegations, but added ""they are horrifying and we take this very seriously.""

Rolle and the family's attorney, Greg Francis, said after Nero, a farmworker, died at 73 in 2013, his son, Robert Nero Jr., hired Stevens Brothers to arrange his cremation. Rolle said her brother then spent weeks getting the ashes back from the mortuary, going there almost daily before he finally received them. They were placed in Corene Nero's home. The son died the following year and was buried by Stevens Brothers, his sister said.

The mystery began March 25 when a West Palm Beach YWCA worker, Scott Manochi, found piles of ashes and two metal identification discs from a crematorium as he cleared brush along a fence. He called police.

According to a police report, officers contacted the crematorium, which said its records showed one set of ashes belonged to Nero and the other to Mary Brown, who died in 2009. Her family has not been located. The crematorium told officers it had handled their bodies for Stevens Brothers, which had picked up the ashes shortly after the deaths.

Officers called Stevens Brothers, which sent employee Willie Watts to collect the ashes from the bushes. Police learned Watts also does grounds work for the YWCA.

When an AP reporter asked Watts by phone Tuesday about the ashes, he replied, ""I don't know nothing about it."" When read the police report, Watts laughed and declined to comment.

Miami Dade College mortuary science professor Joseph Finocchiaro said it's unlikely the ashes could have been outdoors for long — rain and wind would have scattered them.

West Palm Beach Sgt. David Lefont said investigators don't believe a crime was committed — Florida law doesn't prohibit the dumping of ashes on private property.

The Neros learned about the ashes' discovery when contacted by local television stations. Rolle said she at first refused to believe that the YWCA ashes could be her father's. But as the likely reality set in, she broke down.

""I went and sat down for a couple hours until I could get myself together,"" Rolle said.

Finocchiaro said when a funeral home picks up a body, a wristband is attached and every time the body changes hands the accompanying paperwork is supposed to be checked to make sure the identification matches. Redundant identification is often also attached to the coffin or other container.

At the crematorium, a metal disk like the one found with the ashes is created, he said. That disk accompanies the ashes through every step from the crematorium to the mortuary to the family, he said.

""From start to finish, you should be able to draw a line all the way back,"" he said.

He said the cremation process almost always destroys the body's DNA, so attempting to identify the cremains in the Nero family's urn is an extreme longshot.

Rolle said she understands she'll probably never know for sure what happened to her father, but she needs to try.

""We all love him and we are doing everything we can to get him back,"" Rolle said.

557,Judge gives grandparents custody of boy as parents fight cancer treatment,"The parents of 3-year-old Noah McAdams fled the state rather than continue chemotherapy. Now a judge has placed the child in the custody of his maternal grandparents.

TAMPA — The 3-year-old boy caught in a legal tug of war over how he will be treated for leukemia will be turned over to the custody of his maternal grandparents, a judge ruled Thursday.

Noah McAdams, 3, was tracked down Monday in Kentucky, after his parents refused additional chemotherapy treatment for his acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, and instead fled Tampa.

The parents, Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball, failed to show up for the boy’s scheduled chemotherapy treatment at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg. To keep him out of the hospital, they decided to treat his cancer with natural remedies and fled the state, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office.

That led Florida authorities to issue an endangered child alert on Monday. Hours later, the family was tracked down to a motel room in Georgetown, Ky.

Hillsborough Circuit Judge Lisa Campbell ruled Thursday that Noah will go home with his maternal grandparents while she decides how his cancer will be treated. The boy is currently at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg. When doctors decided to release him, he’ll go home with the grandparents.

But the case is far from over and Noah will not yet resume treatment.

The judge must also decide whether the parents were within their rights to decline chemotherapy. To prepare for that hearing, the parents’ lawyer will have a doctor he found examine the child and give a second opinion as to the best treatment option for Noah. That will lead to another court hearing.

Before Thursday’s hearing started, the 23-year-old mother brought photos of her brown-eyed, blonde-haired child and laid them out on a courtroom table. She said she was sending a silent message to the judge, social workers and child protective investigators working on Noah’s case.

“I wanted (the photos) to be out when everybody was documenting, when they had the cameras going during the hearing,” Bland-Ball said. “I wanted people to see, those that are watching the case and the social workers to see as well, that we’re a happy family. Noah was very happy with us. He’s so loved, so there’s really no reason to go through all this.”

The boy was first diagnosed with leukemia by Johns Hopkins doctors on April 4, the mother said, after his parents took him from one emergency room to another in an attempt to find what had suddenly made him “sluggish” and “not himself.”

At first, Bland-Ball and her husband, Joshua McAdams, agreed that Noah should undergo chemotherapy treatments at the hospital, they told the judge. But after about 10 days there, the boy's father said they became worried about their son's care and told staff they were going to seek a second medical opinion.

“The hospital's governing body was disorganized and the doctors were not pleasant or professional to us,” McAdams, 28, testified. “It seemed like doctors were disappearing on us and just passing down Noah's information second hand ...

“There was intimidation from social workers who looked at me like I was not interested in my son’s health because I didn't want to give my son chocolate milk, or pudding, or ice cream. I care for my son and it's very important that we watch what he eats.”

The father said his wife contacted Johns Hopkins multiple times about their concerns. Then last week she told doctors they had had enough. Noah would no longer go to his scheduled chemotherapy appointments. The family set out for Ohio, where Bland-Ball said she had arranged for Noah to see a doctor who would provide alternative treatments.

“We have phone records we have voicemails we left for them and we even spoke to the social worker the physicians assistant and the doctor to tell them we were seeking a second opinion,” Bland-Ball said.

The father testified that the couple had already started treating Noah with CBD oil, fresh foods and clean alkaline water.

But Dr. Bijal D. Shah, head of the Moffitt Cancer Center’s acute lymphoblastic leukemia program, told the Tampa Bay Times this week that natural remedies do nothing.

In fact, he said the accepted medical treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia has become very effective. The cure rate is up to 90 percent, though it does require a patient to endure 2½ years of chemotherapy and the resulting side effects.

Kentucky authorities found the family Monday evening. They took Noah to a local hospital for treatment, then put him on a plane back to Tampa. His parents are now the subject of an investigation into criminal charges of medical neglect for refusing proper medical treatment for a child considered to be “gravely ill.”

During the hearing, a child protective investigators testified that she left voicemails and a Facebook message for the parents to tell them that they were under investigation. But the parents testified they never got those messages.

The couple’s lawyer, Michael Minardi, said a blood test taken Wednesday showed no trace of leukemia in Noah's blood.

“I know a doctor's not going to come back and say that chemotherapy is the best option and is the only treatment for him,” the lawyer said, “and I think that's the problem we have in this country right now is the fallacy of doctors pushing chemotherapy ... It destroys people.”

But Shah told the Times that patients who stop chemotherapy early are risking their health. The cancer return almost always returns.

“I put it in the same box as those who fear vaccination,” the doctor said. “The reality is, what we risk by not taking chemotherapy, just as what we risk by not taking vaccines, is much, much worse.”

559,Taplow Pub at PGA Golf Club offers casual but sensational food in beautiful atmosphere,"Two golfers walk into a pub after finishing a round at the PGA Golf Course and join some neighbors for lunch.

No, it’s not a joke; this is what happens every day at the Taplow Pub.

Located within the PGA Village and inside the Golf Club, the pub is open to both members and non-members.

Taplow Pub's chili was mildly spicy, thick, hearty and very enjoyable. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED BY LUCIE REGENSDORF)

Taplow is laid out as precisely as the golf greens. Two high-tops down the middle encourage camaraderie and tall tales. On either side are tables and chairs upholstered in plaid. Blue leather booths line the walls. At the far end is a large bar with taupe leather stools. Overhead, and on each side of the booths, televisions are tuned to golf (naturally). Round capiz shell chandeliers and palm frond-bladed fans hang from high ceilings.

The lunch and dinner menu is what you would expect: classy pub fare. Appetizers include soups, wings, nachos and potato skins. Salads, pizza, burgers, sandwiches and club favorite entrees complete the choices.

The menu clearly states a 20% service charge for food and beverage services will be added automatically to your bill and no additional gratuity is necessary. I have mixed feelings about automatic gratuities, but this was not an issue for us since the service we received was excellent.

My husband and I ordered drinks and baked pretzel braids ($9) to share. Two large pretzel braids were served with a side of queso sauce and brown mustard. The hot, soft, salty pretzels were served on a wooden cutting board. Ripped into hunks appropriate for dipping, they were delicious.

Our waiter, Sean, told us the pizza and the hamburgers were amazing, but the meatloaf and salmon were definitely pub favorites. My husband chose the homestyle meatloaf ($16). He started with a cup of chili topped with cheese, sour cream and scallions. The chili was only mildly spicy but was thick, hearty and enjoyable.

Taplow Pub's meatloaf was enhanced by a zesty and sweet demi-glaze. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED BY LUCIE REGENSDORF)

His dinner was two slices of house-made beef meatloaf full of mushrooms and onions, along with a Cabernet, caramelized onion and mushroom demi-glace. The meatloaf was full of great flavors, but the texture was a little dry. The zesty and sweet glaze was wonderful and enhanced the meatloaf tremendously. The cole slaw was disappointing and tasteless.

I ordered the Taplow Atlantic salmon ($21). The fish was excellent, perfectly pan seared with a light crust on the outside but moist on the inside. It was topped with a silky, lemony, buttery sauce. A scoop of creamy red-skinned mashed potatoes and a palate-pleasing medley of sautéed squash and red peppers made it a hole-in-one. The chef should have put a couple of wedges of lemon on the plate for the salmon, but, at my request, Sean quickly brought me some.

For dessert, we ordered a triple chocolate cake ($6) with a side of vanilla ice cream ($1). What appeared was a humongous, decadent slice of rich, triple-layered cake with equally thick chocolate icing. The dessert was nothing short of bingo, bango, bongo.

Taplow Pub at PGA Golf Club is a charming spot for golfers to relax after a game or for anyone who simply wants to dine in a beautiful club atmosphere on casual but sensational food.

561,Drake breaks Taylor Swift's record at Billboard Music Awards,"Mother's Day is in a couple weeks, but Drake gave his mom an early gift with a heartfelt speech at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, where the rap star also broke Taylor Swift's record for most wins.

Drake turned up the love for his mom when he picked up top artist, besting Cardi B, Ariana Grande, Post Malone and Travis Scott. He won 12 awards Wednesday in Las Vegas, making his career total 27 (Swift has 23 wins).

He looked up to the ceiling as he held the trophy, then said: ""I just want to thank my mom for her relentless effort in my life.

""I want to thank my mom for all the times you drove me to piano. All the times you drove me to basketball and hockey "" that clearly didn't work out. All the times you drove me to 'Degrassi.' No matter how long it took me to figure out what I wanted to do, you were always there to give me a ride, and now we're on one hell of ride,"" Drake said.

Family bonding was a theme at the three-hour show, which aired live on NBC and was hosted by Kelly Clarkson

Ciara's young son and husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, danced along while she worked the stage, and Nick and Joe Jonas gave kisses to Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner of ""Game of Thrones"" fame when they sang in the audience before hitting the stage. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco looked to his parents as he accepted top rock song, quoting the name of his current hit: ""Hey look Ma, I made it!""

Mariah Carey's twins cheered her on as she sang a medley of her hits and accepted the Icon award. She was in diva form before taking the award from Jennifer Hudson, throwing her napkin on the floor after dabbing her face with it.

""Without getting into all the drama, all the ups and downs of my career ... I guess I always felt like an outsider, someone who doesn't quite belong anywhere, and I still feel like that lost interracial child who had a lot of nerve to believe I could succeed at anything at all in this world. But, and this is the truth, I did believe because I had to,"" she said. ""The truth is I dedicated my life to my music "" my saving grace "" and to my fans.""

Cardi B, the night's top nominee with 21, locked lips with husband Offset on the red carpet and the couple sat closely inside the venue. She won six awards, including top Hot 100 song for ""Girls Like You"" with Maroon 5.

""I remember when Maroon 5 hit me up to do this song. I was like, 'Bro I'm five months pregnant. I can't even breathe.' But this record to me was so amazing. I was like, 'Oh this is going to be a hit.' And now I sing this song to my daughter because she's the girl that I need,"" she said.

Drake and Cardi B "" who both won multiple awards during the live telecast "" used their speeches to promote love and appreciation for their peers in the music industry.

Others, too, brought on the positive energy when onstage. Imagine Dragons' band leader Dan Reynolds used his speech to highlight the dangers of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. He earned rousing applause. Florida Georgia Line's Tyler Hubbard followed suit, telling the audience after winning top country song: ""In the spirit of so much truth being spoken tonight by so many talented artists, I think we should speak some truth.""

""As artists we all get to experience so many unbelievable things, but in our opinion, at the end of the day, it's all for nothing if you're not using your platform for better ... to spread love, to help those in needs, to be a light to your community,"" he said.

Swift kicked off the show when she brought her new music video to life with a colorful, eye-popping performance of her song ""ME!"" Dancers wearing bright, pastel colors spun in the air holding umbrellas and a marching band kicked off Swift's performance "" like most of the world, maybe she was inspired by Beyonce's new Coachella film?

Madonna, wearing an eye-patch, teamed up with Colombian singer Maluma for a performance, but it was Grammy-winning Christian artist Lauren Daigle who had the night's best performance. She sang ""You Say,"" giving the audience a calm, yet strong and powerful performance. She was backed by three awesome background singers and a pianist.

BTS, who performed alongside Halsey, also had a major night. At the Billboard Awards and American Music Awards, the K-pop band had only previously won ""social"" awards based off their fanatic fan base, but on Wednesday BTS picked up top duo/group, besting Grammy-winning groups like Maroon 5, Imagine Dragons and Dan + Shay.

""I still can't believe we're here on this stage with so many great artists,"" RM said as fans screamed loudly. ""We're still the same boys from six years ago, we still have the same dreams ... we still have the same thoughts. Let us keep dreaming.""

An unlikely winner at the Billboard Awards? ""Game of Thrones"" actress Maisie Williams, whose plays Arya Stark on the HBO series and shined brightly on last week's episode.

""Shout-out to Arya Stark for putting in that work last week,"" Drake said onstage after winning his first award of the evening.

FARRON: WELCOME BACK. MICHAEL JOHNSON -- I AM SURE YOU HAVE HEARD THAT NAME -- IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINCTIVE SPRINTERS IN THE HISTORY OF TRACK AND FIELD, BEING A FOUR-TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST. ONE WOULD THINK HE WOULD BE IMMUNE TO ANY HEALTH ISSUES. ERIN: PICTURE-PERFECT HELP. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE THINKING. BUT LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, MICHAEL SUFFERED A STROKE, LEAVING HIM UNABLE TO WALK AND FEEL HIS ARM OR FINGERS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. TODAY, MICHAEL IS DEDICATING HIS TIME TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT STROKE. SO, HERE TO TELL US HOW TO PREVENT AND SPOT WARNING SIGNS OF A STROKE IS MICHAEL JOHNSON AND DR. CAROLYN BROCKINGTON, DIRECTOR OF THE STROKE CENTER AT MOUNT SINAI ST. LUKE’S AND MOUNT SINAI WEST HOSPITAL IN NEW YORK CITY. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. MICHAEL, WE HAVE TO START WITH YOU, AND AMERICAN HERO, IF YOU WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR STROKE STORY. MICHAEL: IT JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. I WAS -- THIS WAS LAST AUGUST. FINISHED A WORKOUT NO PROBLEMS. GREAT WORKOUT. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I STARTED FEELING THIS WEAKNESS AND LACK OF COORDINATION IN MY LEFT LEG AND FOOT, AND ALSO NUMBNESS AND TINGLING IN MY LEFT ARM, WHICH WAS A STRANGE SITUATION. I DID NOT FEEL ANY PAIN OR IMMEDIATE DISCOMFORT, JUST THIS STRANGE SENSATION THAT DID NOT GO AWAY. ULTIMATELY, I MADE THE DECISION TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, REALLY, BUT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO, BECAUSE I WAS EVENTUALLY DIAGNOSED AS HAVING SUFFERED A STROKE IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BRAIN. FARRON: IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE DOING A LOT BETTER NOW. DR. BROCKINGTON -- BRICKINGTON, YOU ARE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF RESEARCH. WHAT DO OUR VIEWERS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT STROKES? CAROLYN: MICHAEL TOLD IT BETTER THAN I CAN. THE CLASSIC DESCRIPTION OF STROKE IS, ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS. PEOPLE THINK IT WILL HAPPEN OVER A LONG COUPLE OF TIME. IT HAPPENS OVER SECONDS OR MINUTES. NOT ENOUGH BLOOD IS GETTING TO THE BRAIN. THAT PART OF THE BRAIN BECOMES INJURED AND DEVELOPS SYMPTOMS. SUDDENLY, HE HAD SYMPTOMS ON THE LAST SIDE OF HIS BODY. SINCE THE RIGHT SET OF HIS BRAIN CONTROLS THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY, IF THEY JUST OF THE BRAIN WAS NOT GETTING ENOUGH BLOOD FLOW, ALMOST LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH. A STROKE IS AN EMERGENCY. PEOPLE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE SYMPTOMS AND GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE HOSPITAL. NOT GOOGLE. NOT FIGURE IT OUT. NOT CALL A FRIEND. EVERY MOMENT THAT GOES BY THAT THE BRAIN IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH WHAT FLOW, YOU ARE CAUSING POTENTIALLY IRREVERSIBLE INJURY TO THAT PART OF THE BRAIN. THE FASTER WE CAN DIAGNOSE AND GIVE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT -- THE TREATMENT WE HAVE THESE DAYS IS VERY EFFECTIVE. BUT IT IS ONLY EFFECTIVE WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME WINDOW. YOU REALLY HAVE JUST MOMENTS TO FIGURE IT OUT AND CALL 911. ERIN: SECONDS MATTER. THAT IS FOR SURE. TALK ABOUT SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, NOT ONLY FOR THE PATIENT, BUT PERHAPS A CAREGIVER OR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MIGHT BE WATCHING THIS UNFOLD IN FRONT OF THEM. CAROLYN: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STROKE, WE SAY TIME IS BRAIN. WE WANT PEOPLE TO ACT FAST. IF YOU THINK OF THE WORD FAST, F, A, S, T, F IS FOR FACE. IF SOMEONE’S FACE IS DROOPING, THEY NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. A IS FOR ARMS. IF YOUR ARM CANNOT RAISE OR YOUR LINK IS NOT WORKING WELL, THAT MIGHT BE A STROKE. S IS FOR SPEECH. IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE YOUR SPEECH IS GARBLED, ALMOST LIKE YOU ARE DRUNK, OR YOU CANNOT THINK OF THE WORDS YOU WANT TO SAY OR CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT SOMEONE IS SAYING TO YOU. T IS FOR TIME. PEOPLE SHOULD CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY, AS THEY WILL RECOGNIZE AFTER YOU SAY YOU ARE HAVING A STROKE THAT YOU NEED TO BE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WITH A STROKE TEAM, WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF STROKE, DIAGNOSE IT, AND TREAT IT AS IT SHOULD BE. FARRON: A GOOD ACRONYM TO REMEMBER. MICHAEL, WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU MORE. WHERE ARE YOU WITH YOUR RECOVERY? DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY BE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION? MICHAEL: SURE, I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO MAKE A FULL RECOVERY, AS THE DOCTOR SAID. I GOT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM QUICK AND WAS ABLE TO GET TREATMENT VERY QUICKLY. AND THEN I WAS ABLE TO GET INTO PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY TO REGAIN BALANCE AND REGAIN ORDINATION, TAKE SOME TIME -- REGAIN COORDINATION, TAKE SOME TIME OFF OF WORK. IT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE TYPE OF FOCUS THAT WAS REQUIRED FOR ME TO ACHIEVE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS AS AN OLYMPIC ATHLETE. I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE THAT BACKGROUND, AND VERY FORTUNATE AS WELL TO HAVE BEEN IN GOOD PHYSICAL SHAPE AND CONDITION BEFORE THE STROKE. A LOT OF PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY WOULD THINK ""YOU WERE IN GREAT SHAPE. YOU WERE DOING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS, AND YOU STILL HAD A STROKE, SO WHY BOTHER?"" THAT IS FLAWED THINKING. I WAS FORTUNATE TO MAKE A FULL RECOVERY AND I THINK A LOT HAD TO DO WITH THE FACT I WAS KEEPING MYSELF IN GOOD SHAPE ANYWAY. I WAS GOING TO HAVE THAT STROKE REGARDLESS. ANY STROKES ARE NOT PREVENTABLE. I AM WORKING NOW TO PREVENT A SECOND STROKE BY CONTINUING TO KEEP MYSELF IN SHAPE, TAKE CARE OF MYSELF, EAT A HEALTHY DIET, AND WORK CLOSELY WITH MY DR. M TEAM OF DOCTORS TO MINIMIZE THOSE RISK FACTORS. ERIN: I AM GLAD YOU ARE DOING WELL AND TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY.

564,Try transit as an alternative to driving everywhere,"Michelle Arnold, director of Public Transit & Neighborhood Enhancement Division for Collier County (Photo: submitted)

I had the pleasure of meeting someone who recently moved to Collier County after living and working in India for three years. He informed me that while living there, he and his family did not drive. They were either driven by a personal driver or shared rides. It wasn’t until he returned to the United States that he realized how much his stress level was reduced by not driving.

In keeping with the Blue Zones Project Power 9 principles to move naturally and downshift, I offer you an alternative to driving and instead take public transit.

To use transit, you will be required to move naturally by walking to the nearest bus stop. For some people, the distance to the closest stop might be as much as a half-mile. Some may access the nearest bus stop with the aid of a bike or other wheeled device. Your walk or ride to the closest bus stop will be your choice toward better or sustained health.

At least once a month I like to take public transit to work. Sometimes I’ll ride my bike to the stop, and on clear, cool days I enjoy the walk. It’s amazing how much more I observe when I’m on my walk. My walk takes about 15 minutes, and it allows me to plan my day or just enjoy the beautiful place where I live. Often, I run into the same people on my walk: a mother packing the car full of kids for the trip to school or a neighbor taking the dog for their morning walk.

When I board the bus, I am greeted by a friendly driver who waits for me to find a seat before he starts the bus to the next stop. Depending on the day, I might listen to music on my headphones, catch up on Facebook or maybe start the work day by answering emails. Similar to my walk, I often see familiar faces on the bus ride. The bus route I take gives me a couple of options, so I run in to a variety of folks. Riding the bus really allows me to downshift, in the morning and then again at the end of the day.

Choosing transit has not only allowed me to practice moving naturally and downshifting, but it gives me a further appreciation of the community that I live in. I encourage you to make that choice every now and then — or from now on! You will surely benefit, and you might come to love it.

565,Daddy Duty: A 4-year-old can be a great teacher,"Buy Photo Isabella points to the bird house that she had just hung from the limb of a tree in our backyard. (Photo: Tim Walters/FLORIDA TODAY)

With only a few weeks remaining before I retire Daddy Duty, I wanted to make sure my last few columns were meaningful.

The whole purpose of Daddy Duty has been to help parents understand they’re not alone in what they are going through. It also is meant to give a dad’s perspective on raising a girl.

As I searched my mind for what I could write about this week, I watched my 4-year-old Isabella blissfully playing with her toys and watching cartoons.

Buy Photo Tim Walters, Daddy Duty (Photo: Malcolm Denemark/FLORIDA TODAY)

It made me smile. It also made me realize that even though I try to teach her the right way to do things by setting a good example, there are also plenty of things I have learned from her.

Here are some examples.

Be patient.

I would be lying if I said I never raise my voice. I get upset and occasionally yell just like anyone else.

However, over time, my yelling out of frustration has gotten less and less. Having a child has given me the type of patience that you just don’t understand unless you have a child of your own.

If you don’t, you’re not in the club.

Disconnect.

My wife and I could be doing work all the time. But we also have a delightful daughter we want to spend time with.

As parents, we have to disconnect and enjoy our children now because they grow up so quickly.

If you’re always pushing them away so you can finish some work-related thing that you didn’t finish at the office, you may need to reprioritize.

Doing that occasionally is OK. Doing it all the time can be detrimental.

I know we live in a busy world, but our families, especially our small children, need our attention now more than ever.

Be happy.

Isabella has grown up in a positive setting with plenty of encouragement, and thus, she has developed into a smiley, positive, care-free child.

Many mornings she wakes up smiling. She dances around the house and sings. It’s infectious.

We spend so much time in our lives hurrying around, getting annoyed by other people or getting angry in traffic.

Sometimes, it’s OK to slow down and be happy for no reason.

More: Daddy Duty: There's never a bad day in Candy Land

More: Daddy Duty: How homework is a good thing for a preschooler

More: Daddy Duty: 'Do this, don't do that, can't you read the signs?'

Do what you love to do.

When Isabella wakes up, she wants to eat cereal and watch cartoons.

When she gets home from school, she either wants to go to the park, watch cartoons, play Candy Land or do other things that please her.

We parents need to do that.

I know finding time for ourselves can be tough, but even if you carve out a couple of hours on a certain day of the week, it’s possible.

For me, Wednesday is my bowling league. I might not get out the other six nights, but I know at least on that one night, I have somewhere to be and it’s doing something I love.

Ask questions.

I’m a journalist, so asking questions is in my nature. However, for others, it is not.

Isabella is getting to that point where she asks a lot of questions as she learns about the world.

As we get older, we ask fewer questions, sometimes out of fear of looking ignorant, and sometimes for other reasons.

The only way to learn is to ask. And don’t always rely on Google. It’s a good way to check on something, but as technology takes over more of our lives, we aren’t communicating, human-to-human, near as much as we once did.

If you don’t like something, say something.

If a 4-year-old doesn’t like something, they have no problem telling you.

Adults don't necessarily express themselves as freely as a child might.

Speaking your mind and voicing your opinion can be a scary thing, but that’s the only way to truly be happy.

The more you bottle up, the less happy you’ll be.

I’m sure there are plenty more lessons I’ve learned from Isabella. She’s an incredible little lady and I look forward to each new day with her.

Kids grow up fast. Soon, Isabella will want to be with friends or lock herself in her room.

I want to take in every moment I can with her before those things happen.

Take time to observe your kids, and try to be a little more like them.

We spend so much time trying to mold them to be like us that we can forget that they can teach us as much as we can teach them.

Walters has written the parenting column ""Daddy Duty"" since May 22, 2014. His final column will run June 6, 2019. Contact him at twalters@floridatoday.com.

567,Restaurant review: Heidelberg in Cocoa Beach earns five stars after stellar lunch,"A couple of months ago, FLORIDA TODAY’s wonderful former culture columnist, Pam Harbaugh, suggested we have a meal and hear the music at Heidelberg, the splendid little restaurant attached to Heidi’s Jazz Club, in Cocoa Beach.

It was perfect; spot-on in every way, and it would have been reviewed that night had it not been so difficult to obtain photos; it was too dark.

So back we went, four of us this time, to enjoy Austrian and other food, and the judgment did not change: This was a flawless meal with flawless service, in flawless, intimate ambiance.

Buy Photo Colorful art hangs on the walls at Heidelberg Restaurant in downtown Cocoa Beach. (Photo: Lyn Dowling/For FLORIDA TODAY)

Heidelberg is not one of those places hellbent on trend or innovation, modern and colorful though the (original) art on its walls may be. Rather, it is a bastion of the classics, with all the manners you would expect. A silver tray of homemade breads, dark and white, goes on the table at once, with curls of butter; so does water. The server knows the menu and is unafraid to explain what is on it.

What is on it, for lunch or dinner — we ordered a little of each, it being mid-afternoon — represents a combination of continental and American cuisines. For what it’s worth, as we learned on that jazz-seeing visit weeks ago, Heidi’s/Heidelberg more than holds its own as a steakhouse; the filet ($36) was perfect and the Steak Madagascar, in its peppercorn-burgundy-cognac sauce, ($37) is one of Brevard’s best meals.

This one started with baked brie ($13), unlike most in that it has a crispy crumb crust, set among carved fruits with raspberry sauce and, if you’re not allergic, walnuts. The most impressive thing about it, however, was the quality of the cheese, clearly a double-crème and beautifully mild.

Buy Photo Soups at Heidelberg Restaurant in downtown Cocoa Beach always excel, and the cold cucumber soup was no exception. (Photo: Lyn Dowling/For FLORIDA TODAY)

Soups at Heidelberg always excel and this was no exception, the creamy, cold, slightly savory, wholly refreshing cucumber variety being the leader, if there can be one. Lobster bisque was on point too, a true bisque with a satisfying amount of sherry and decorated with a neatly piped bit of crème fraîche.

Our red meat devotee opted for a brie burger ($12.50) and loved it; called the burger perfectly cooked as ordered and the cheese, the perfect accompaniment.

Chicken breast Viennese ($15), our dining companion ordered with red cabbage and spaetzle rather than the potatoes and vegetables that usually come with it, and she was more than pleased with this hot, crispy delight.

Pork schnitzel ($16) is not on the menu but may be ordered, and she who chose it was not sorry she did. It was a big, tender piece of meat enveloped in a light breading, also ordered with faultless spaetzle.

Buy Photo Wiener Schnitzel at Heidelberg Restaurant in downtown Cocoa Beach was perfect: high-quality veal, pounded very thin, breaded, pan-fried and served with lemon, as it should be. (Photo: Lyn Dowling/For FLORIDA TODAY)

Wiener schnitzel ($29) is on the dinner menu, and I wasn’t leaving without it: high-quality veal, like the pork, pounded very thin, breaded, pan-fried and served with lemon, as it should be. It. Was. Perfect. So, by the way, were the roasted potatoes and vegetables that accompanied it.

She who loves red meat also loves red fruit, so she generously ordered cherries jubilee ($28) for the table, and though the tableside show was dandy — our server was expert — the real star was the food: tart-sweet cherries in sauce that was not sugary-sticky, as some versions of the classic can be, done properly, with kirschwasser. Magic!

We passed around an apple strudel ($8) too and it, too, was exactly what you would want: a little crunch, a little sweetness, a lot of apples. And when I asked for an Armagnac ($12), the server didn’t blink; in it came, in a snifter. Glorious!

That’s it. No more is to be said. Heidelberg was perfect. Do dine there.

568,Man accused of throwing cinder block at vehicle as ‘prank',"- A Palm Bay man was arrested over the weekend, accused of throwing a cinder block at a moving car.

The incident happened Friday on Jupiter Boulevard, near Garvey Road.

Robert Pearce said he had his two daughters in the car with him, when someone in an oncoming car threw a piece of cinder block at his SUV.

“As I start to approach them, I see this chunk of debris come flying out of the car through the headlights,” Pearce said. “Then, WHAM! Hit the truck, broke into a couple of pieces.”

Pearce followed the car until the driver pulled onto Malabar Road, nearly hitting a motorcyclist, according to police.

Two passengers in the car told police Kadeem Tomlinson, 20, who was sitting behind the driver, collected a cinder block before getting in the car and stated he was going to throw it at a random car in the roadway as a ‘prank.’

Kadeem is facing charges for criminal mischief and throwing a deadly missile.

570,"Catholic's Damarius McGhee offered by Ole Miss, headed into junior season","CLOSE The most slept-on team in the city? Only one way to find out. BRIAN ACHATZ, bachatz@pnj.com

Damarius McGhee is officially Power 5 conference recruit.

It started with Power 5 interest but on Monday, Ole Miss offered the talented defensive back from the Class of 2021.

McGhee is a 6-foot, 160-pound athlete that shined as a defensive back, wide receiver and kick returner to help fuel Catholic to a breakthrough season that reached the second round of the FHSAA playoffs.

McGhee caught 10 passes for 86 yards, averaged 23. 8 yards per kick return and caught three interceptions – averaging 40 yards per return on each pick.

South Alabama has also offered McGhee as a defensive back, while several Power 5 conference schools and a handful of mid-major Division I programs continue to show interest.

McGhee said he is eager for his junior season and plans to focus on speed and footwork during the off season.

“I didn’t really know how to play DB until this year,” McGhee said. “A couple times this year, people got past me but I was able to use my speed to catch up and my length to reach up and break up a pass.

571,Videos give insight into accused face biter Austin Harrouff's life inside Martin County Jail,"MARTIN COUNTY — In several videos dated February through April 2018, Martin County Jail inmate Austin Harrouff, 23, speaks with family members including his divorced parents, Wade and Mina Harrouff; grandmother, Manijeh Mazuji; and, according to jail records, his dad's girlfriend, Keri Knowles.

Austin Harouff is accused of killing John Stevens III, 59, and Michelle Mishcon, 53, at their Southeast Kokomo Lane home in Martin County on Aug. 15 2016. The Jupiter resident who was attending Florida State University, was found biting and chewing on Stevens' face in the couple's driveway. Detectives recovered what appeared to be flesh from Harrouff's teeth.

He faces two counts of first-degree murder with a weapon for the deaths of Mishcon and Stevens; one charge of burglary of a dwelling with assault or battery while armed for breaking into their garage; and one charge of attempted first-degree murder with a weapon for attacking and injuring the couple's neighbor, Jeffrey Fisher.

Since he has been incarcerated awaiting trial, currently scheduled for Nov. 4, his parents, grandmother and dad's girlfriend often visit with him, recorded on jail video, typically for between an hour and 90 minutes.

Austin Harrouff, who is accused of murdering Jupiter couple John Stevens III and Michelle Mischon, attended a hearing related to his case Friday, Sept. 29, 2017 at the Martin County Courthouse in Stuart. From his hospital room before his arrest in 2016, Harrouff gave an interview to Phillip McGraw of the ""Dr. Phil Show"" discussing the crime and his mental state.

Austin's mother and ""Grand"" would visit at the same time and take turns with the phone as they spoke to him through glass. His father and Knowles often would visit together.

During visits, Austin and his dad would reminisce about old times. He would speak about God and the Bible with Knowles. He often would sing to his grandmother, and while speaking with his mother, Austin shared details about his medications, sleeping habits and demonstrated some odd behavior.

Austin's meds

During a visit from his mom in February 2018, Austin talks about his medications and how they affect his sleep schedules. He later mentions he's taking Zoloft, Trazodone and one other he cannot recall.

Odd behavior

Between conversations in early 2018, Austin begins to sing and will speak to or about someone named ""Brian."" At one point, his mom puts the phone down and says, ""let me know when you're done.""

Sings to grandma

Mazuji sometimes asks if Austin has anything to sing for her. He breaks into song frequently during visits with his mom and grandmother. He typically sings Justin Bieber songs and occasionally songs by Charlie Puth. Austin's dad teases him and calls him ""Austin Bieber.""

Being saved, holidays, joy

Austin speaks about God, the Bible, miracles and 'being saved' with Knowles. She and Austin seem to bond over the topic. She often offers to bring Christian books to him or recommends other reading material.

Sex, drinking and Tinder

Austin, who often speaks about God and being saved, tells his dad how he feels about sex, alcohol and online dating. He continues to say he feels like he sinned while in school, but his dad disagrees and tells Austin he's proud of him.

580,"What Southern Folks Eat - Mmm, Mmm Good: Memories of books and cooking","Books have always held a great deal of interest for me. From the time I was old enough to comprehend that books were a thing, thanks to my parents and their own love of books, I have treasured books of all kinds. I’ve always been an insatiable reader. I was the preschool kid dad recalls sitting in bed with him and mama as they read the newspaper, taking my own section that I’d “read” to them.

As I got a bit older, my mornings often began with a box of Life, Raisin Bran or Cheerios cereal, whose boxes I read over and over as I ate each day, from the fun trivia printed on the back of the box to the nutrition information on the side. When I went to elementary school, I remember taking home the Weekly Reader, and poring over it as I sat at the table or on the living room floor, and when the Bookmobile came to school in my early elementary days in North Carolina, I felt rich if I had a couple of dollars to purchase books with.

In my older elementary and middle school years, I continued my book addiction. Mom and Grammy would take my little sister and me to the library in Port St. Joe once a week during the summer, and we would peruse the shelves for things we’d not yet read. I always checked out the maximum number allowed. I would take my armful of books home, take them to my room, and carefully deliberate over which one I’d read first. It was a wonderful experience, and I hope that you allow your children and grandchildren to have it, as well. School will be out soon!

Once that decision was made, I went a step further. I had a small brown paperback Webster’s Dictionary that I kept beside my bed as I read, in case I came across any words that I didn’t know. I remember how satisfied I was each time I reread a sentence with a word I now understood, and grasped the meaning of the sentence with new insight. I just loved words, and the patterns they made to create meaning intrigued me. Is it any surprise that I later became an English teacher, and then a journalist? Thank you, parents. Thank you, librarians!

It’s also no surprise, in retrospect, that I love cookbooks, too, considering they are a blend of two things I love to do most: cook and read. This was driven home to me one weekend, in a split second, when my sister, Sherrin, and I were in a large antique mall. We walked along each aisle, stopping frequently to take a closer look at some interesting piece of art or furniture, talking about everything in the world as we went along. As we were on the last aisle, we walked past one small booth which contained something tomato-red in color that caught my eye as I passed; something familiar which made me stop in my tracks, and take a step backward to look more closely.

It was a cookbook.

Specifically, it was a cookbook that mama had kept in one of the cabinets at home in our small kitchen through the years. It was bound in hardcover with wire rings along the spine to allow it to lay flat on the home cook’s counter as he or she worked. It was the most perfect color of red; tomato-soup red, I like to call it. It was, in fact, the Campbell’s cookbook, called simply, “Cooking with Soup.”

Ok, so this friendly-looking cookbook is not the caliber of my grandfather’s copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child. It’s not even the caliber of The Better Homes and Gardens cookbook that I have used since my marriage in 1990. However, it is the stuff my childhood cooking dreams were made of.

I recall taking that cookbook and sitting at the kitchen table with it, looking carefully at the simple line drawings displayed on every few pages. I would ponder the few photographs that the book had in it, as well, marveling at how the dishes were fetchingly served in copper pans or on plates the color of a Florida orange. (It was printed in 1970, so orange was a big deal in design, you may recall.) I read the recipes that sounded interesting to my young mind; one that stood out was porcupine meatballs, which featured rice which poked out and gave the savory spheres their prickly appearance.

I loved that cookbook, and I love that memory. Of course, I produced the six dollars the vendor charged for the book, and took it home to carefully remove the large white adhesive label she had so rudely smacked onto the front cover.

With the little tomato-soup red cookbook now restored to its 1970s glory, I happily searched through it to find a recipe that I thought my husband and I would enjoy for Sunday night supper. I decided on Swiss steak with vegetables.

It was a simple, straightforward recipe, made with beef, carrots and potatoes and a can of French onion soup, which I have to say, made a pretty wonderful and simple gravy. This tasted like old-fashioned pot roast with veggies, but it was faster to make, which is a plus.

Here’s the recipe with minor adjustments, in case you’d like to try it in your own kitchen.

Swiss Steak with Vegetables

1/2 cup plain flour mixed with 1 teaspoon of your favorite seasoning blend, such as Tony Chachere’s

1 pound beef cube steak

2 tablespoons olive oil (original recipe called for shortening)

1 can Campbell’s French onion soup

1/2 cup to 3/4 cup water

4 large carrots, chopped into two-inch pieces, or 2 cups baby carrots

4 medium potatoes, halved, or about ten whole small new potatoes

1 tablespoon parsley, optional

Method:

Place flour and seasoning in a bowl, mixing well with fork.

Place each steak into the flour mixture, patting it so both sides are coated well. Set aside.

Pour oil into large skillet, and heat over medium-high heat.

When oil sizzles as a drop of water is carefully sprinkled into it, add the steak pieces to the pan.

Brown steaks on both sides.

Add the French onion soup, water, and vegetables.

Nestle the vegetables down into the onion soup.

Cover and simmer over low heat for 45 minutes or until potatoes and carrots are tender.

Serve in soup bowls, find a comfy spot to sit down, and enjoy.

584,"Laugh, cry, hope, wonder: Three Naples plays opening this week tackle it all","CLOSE The Studio Players run through a dress rehearsal of Over the River and Through the Woods at Golden Gate Community Center on Monday, April 29. Alex Driehaus, Naples Daily News

While season has nearly gone, theater lovers can breathe a collective sigh of relief knowing there's still a chance to catch a play — or three — in Naples.

Here are the final theatrical productions coming to a stage near you:

'Skylight'

Todd Weeks and Amy Blackman rehearse Skylight at Gulfshore Playhouse in Naples on Tuesday, April 30, 2019. (Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

He's a self-made entrepreneur, who recently lost his wife and the business he spent decades building. She's a young schoolteacher, who said goodbye to her privileged past to join the working class.

At first, it seems as though Kyra Hollis (played by Amy Blackman) and Tom Sergeant (Todd Weeks) in ""Skylight"" have nothing in common, that is until you realize they're old flames.

""This is a couple you feel should belong together despite their intense disagreements,"" Blackman said. And big age difference. In the script, Kyra is around 30 years old, and Tom is nearly 50.

The drama takes place at Kyra's modest London flat three years after her affair with Tom, who happens to pay her a surprise visit one cold winter night.

This reunion isn't necessarily a happy one. The former lovers debate everything from politics and the state of the nation to, of course, their past. All the while, Blackman's character is cooking spaghetti over a real stove — making things even saucier.

""Both of these characters have incredibly strong beliefs and passions and with that comes a real electricity with language,"" Blackman said.

The Tony Award–winning play, written by British dramatist David Hare, comes to Gulfshore Playhouse, May 4-19. ""Skylight,"" which first premiered more than 20 years ago, has been revived a handful of times, most recently in 2015 at the Golden Theater in New York City starring actors Bill Nighy and Carey Mulligan.

""I was immediately blown away by the ideas packed into (the play), while being accessible and at its core a love story,"" Todd Weeks said. For much of the dialogue-heavy production, Weeks and Blackman are alone onstage.

""I'm so grateful to her professionalism, her warmth, her willingness to trust me ... she's also really, really good,"" Weeks said about his co-star. ""I have to keep up with her, which is good for me as an actor and also perfect for this play and the characters' relationship to each other.""

In addition to the show, there will be free pre-show discussions May 5, 8 and 19, where Gulfshore Playhouse artistic staff lead conversations about themes and topics related to the production. Audience members can also stick around for post-show conversations on May 9 and 12.

When: Evening shows begin at 8 p.m.; matinees begin at 3 p.m. — May 4 -19

'Lost in Yonkers'

CLOSE Eddie (Bernardo Santana) reveals to his sons Jay (Brian Boland) and Arty (Leonard Allen) how deeply in debt he is in Naples Players' ""Lost in Yonkers."" Harriet Howard Heithaus, harriet.heithaus@naplesnews.com; 239-213-6091

At one time, grandmas seemed much more of an extension of history — a fascinating, if slightly musty, look at decades long past. They were fashion-resistant: Their version of high heels was black oxford, laced up, with a heel like a tin can; they wore aprons they made from flour sacks and had stone-gray hair that had never known Clairol.

Jay and Arty, central characters of “Lost in Yonkers,” have all that in their Grandmother Kurnitz, but without the propensity to make heavenly chocolate chip cookies or take her second-generation progeny to the movies. She is fearsome, blunt and miserly. And Jay and Arty — soon to become Yakob and Artur — are about to come live with her.

A Naples Players production of Neil Simon play about a suffering, scrapping family, told from all its characters, opened this week at Sugden Community Theatre. Naples Players Executive/artistic Director Bryce Alexander is directing this one, and he’s excited about it.

Jay (Brian Boland), Arty (Leonard Allen) and their dad, Eddie (Bernardo Santana) are trying to impress Grandma (Bonnie Knapp) in ""Lost in Yonkers,"" but she is having none of it. (Photo: Neubek Photographers)

“I’m a sucker for anything Americana, anything by the great American playwrights — Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, and in this work, especially Neil Simon. You don’t usually see him in that genre. But this and his three autobiographical plays put him there later in his career trying to write about serious situations and find the light in them,” Alexander said, speaking of Brighton Beach Memoirs (1983), Biloxi Blues (1985) and Broadway Bound (1986). “To me, ‘Lost in Yonkers’ is that classic melding of a family drama and finance, told in only the tonality that Simon can bring it.”

“Lost in Yonkers” won Simon the Pulitzer Prize, along with a slew of Tonys.

The two main stars are KidzAct veterans Brian Boland (Jay) and Leonard Allen (Arty) as the alternately terrified and enterprising grandsons who must survive while their father is on an itinerant contract to get the family finances stabilized.

“It’s their first time on the mainstage, and they don’t disappoint,” Alexander said. “Both these boys are phenomenal.”

What Alexander calls their “dramedy” plays out in a dated Yonkers apartment with the framework of New York skyscrapers in the background. It’s the brainchild of Todd Potter, scenic designer.

“The underlying symbol is the presence of steel,” explained Madie Pursell, his assistant designer. Steel is the metal that’s going to help Eddie, the boys’ father, get back on his feet financially after taking out loans to pay for his wife’s unsuccessful cancer treatments. Steel is also the undergirding for a growing, changing society in New York, which the boys and Grandma view with vastly different perspectives.

“It partly relates to the grandmother, who’s experience a lot of loss in her life,” Pursell added. “She’s developed a personal strength, but has become a bit rigid.”

When: 7:30 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays, 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays and 2 p.m. Sundays now through May 26

Where: Blackburn Hall, Sugden Community Theatre, 701 Fifth Ave. S., Naples

Tickets: $40

To buy:naplesplayers.org or 239-263-7990

Something else: One-hour behind-the-scenes theater tours are offered at 10:30 a.m. Thursdays; please call for reservations two weeks in advance; 239-434-7340, ext. 100

'Over the River and Through the Woods'

If there s a mirror image to ""Lost in Yonkers,"" the Jewish German immigrant experience, it's ""Over the River and Through the Woods,"" the Italian-Catholic immigrant experience.

The Studio Players open that play by Joe DiPetro this weekend. And in this case, far from disdaining having a grandkid around, both sets of grandparents are frantic to keep their last grandson, Nicolas, in Hoboken with them. That doesn't square well with his having just received a dream job promotion that will take him to Seattle.

As director Paula Keenan points out, the ""better life"" for which his grandparents have worked so hard to give their children has scattered them to the winds.

""The parents have moved to Florida. Everyone has moved, except Nick, and they hold onto him like Velcro,"" Keenan said.

These grandparents are warm, embracing, even smothering. (""I got ya a Mass card, two weeks from today, St. Anns, 10:30,"" one gram hopefully tells an ailing Nick.) But it's fun to watch them answer Trivial Pursuit questions with that crazy logic only longtime friends and family have, to fabricate stories of their past lives and alternately anticipate — but then forget to have — waiting cannolis.

There are heartbreaking moments, too, as when Grandpa Frank reveals his misguided resentments about his own father, who put him on a U.S.-bound ship at age 14. The inability of family members to communicate their own pain runs like a motherlode through both this and ""Yonkers.""

""I like this show. I've always liked this show,"" said Keenan, who plunged right into it after starring in ""Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike"" for Studio Players in March. She describes it, as director Bryce Alexander did for the Naples Players' ""Yonkers,"" as a ""dramedy.""

""There's life. There's death. There's dancing and singing, just a little. I think everyone can relate to these families.""

Although the title has the ring of a familiar Thanksgiving melody, it refers to the cozy domesticity of family gatherings, and there are plenty, even if, at times, they are to share a tragedy. Bring tissues.

When: 8 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays, May 4 through 18; 3 p.m. Sundays, May 5 through 19

586,FPC boys win Region 1-4A track title in Winter Park,"The Flagler Palm Coast boys track and field team won the Region 1-4A meet at Winter Park Saturday behind wins in individual races by Nathan Farrell and Jacob Miley and another strong performance by Bulldog relay teams.

Buoyed by an emotional tribute to a fallen teammate, Flagler Palm Coast’s boys track and field team won the Region 1-4A meet at Winter Park Saturday behind strong individual races by Nathan Farrell and Jacob Miley and another strong performance by Bulldog relay teams.

Farrell won the 300 meter hurdles and took second in the 110s, while Miley had one of the fastest performances in his career to win the boys region 4A. They were both factors, along with Darrell Thomas and Morris Jeffers, in winning the 4x400 relay and Miley joined Thomas, Shaun Gordon and John “JT” Dahlberg in taking second in the 4x800 relay.

FPC also got third-place efforts from throwers Nelson Paul and De’Shaun Hugee and a fourth place in the 300 hurdles from Ken’Deric Morton. Those top four finishers and a handful of others will represent FPC for the FHSAA Class 4A state meet this weekend at Hodges Stadium on the Jacksonville campus of the University of North Florida.

Saturday’s regional meet was at historic Showalter Field in Winter Park and was the first for the Bulldogs since the shooting death of teammate Curtis Gray outside a Palm Coast coin laundry more than two weeks ago. The FPC team decided this week to dedicate the 2019 season to Gray, a senior who had plans to graduate in a couple of weeks, and Saturday’s win emphasized their efforts to honor him appropriately.

“It was nearly a perfect day,” FPC coach Dave Halliday said. “We qualified everyone we needed to, plus some bonuses. The kids have dedicated their season to Curt, and it showed.”

Miley is going to his fourth straight state track meet in the 800 — he also qualified in events in prior seasons at Matanzas — with one of his fastest times in the half-mile. The University of Florida athletic scholarship signee ran 1:54.03, fully four seconds faster than he ran at the District 1-4A meet three weeks ago.

The Five Star Conference champions also got qualifying results in three other events. Farrell was third in the 110 hurdles at 14.61 seconds, Paul took third in the shot put at 50 feet, 4¾ inches and and Hugee also got third in the discus with a top toss of 146-10.

The Bulldogs have qualifiers in five events for at-large spots in Jacksonville.

Pole vaulter Maxim Bystrov took fifth, going 12-3½ for fifth in the pole vault. He will be seeded 11th based on that result at the upcoming state meet.

FPC also advances two other throwers. Tyler Dunn placed seventh with a 46-5½ throw in the shot and Verneal Henshaw threw the discus 143-7, also good for seventh. FPC’s 4x100 team was eighth in 43.13 seconds to get the 23rd seed at the state meet.

FPC’s girls team scored 15.5 team points for 18th in the field and will send five competitors to Jacksonville this weekend.

Triple-jumper Prosperity Wright jumped 36 feet, 9½ for third place in the best showing among the Lady Bulldogs. Also moving on to states are Jahlia McCaskell, who took sixth in the 300 hurdles (46.89), Ekatereena Kouzina, who did 8-4¼ in the pole vault for fifth, a seventh-place finish for shot-putter Anisa Zwolinski at 34-9¾ and discus thrower Ryan Montgomery also advances with a toss of 103-11, ninth in the Region 1 field. Also scoring, but not advancing, was 200 meter sprinter Susann Kaufmann who finished seventh in 26.79 seconds.

Matanzas at Region 2-3A

Matanzas will have only two representatives this weekend at the Class 3A meet in Jacksonville. The Lady Pirates team got a third-place finish the 400 meter run from Ja’Dashia Catlin. She ran the event in 58.42 seconds.

The Mississippi state flag will no longer fly in New Jersey's Liberty State Park overlooking the Statue of Liberty because it includes the Confederate battle flag in its design, New Jersey's governor announced Friday.The flag will be replaced by an American flag.Flags from every state are flown along Freedom Way, which runs through Liberty Park facing New York Harbor at the mouth of the Hudson River. The park has a view of Manhattan, Ellis Island and Liberty Island, home to the Statue of Liberty.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy ordered Mississippi's flag removed after New Jersey state Sen. Sandra Cunningham raised the issue, according to a statement from the governor's office. ""The Confederate flag symbolizes an era of hate, violence, and division,"" said Cunningham.Murphy said the Confederate flag does not represent his state's commitment to diversity.""New Jersey's strength is rooted in our diverse communities,"" he said in a statement. ""The Confederate symbol displayed on the Mississippi state flag is reprehensible and does not reflect our values of inclusivity and equality.""""I'm disappointed in Gov. Murphy's actions,"" Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said in a statement to NJ.com. ""As I have repeatedly said, the voters of Mississippi should decide what the state flag is or is not,"" the statement added.Mississippi's flag is the only state flag to feature the Confederate symbol, also known as the Southern Cross. It has been included in the flag's top left corner since it was adopted by the state legislature in 1894.To some, the Confederate battle flag is considered an important part of history, while others see it a controversial and racist symbol of American slavery.A revamped flag, without the Confederate design, was approved to adorn Mississippi license plates earlier this month.Designed by local Mississippi artist Laurin Stennis, the new flag design features 19 blue stars around one central star with a red stripe on either side. The number of stars signify that Mississippi was the 20th state to join the Union in 1817.The last time the state considered changing the flag was in 2001, when 65% of voters chose then to keep the flag with the Confederate symbol.New Jersey's Liberty Park will join several cities and public universities, including the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University, which have already ceased to fly the controversial state flag.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/mississippi-flag-ordered-out-of-state-park-because-it-includes-confederate-emblem/27310357,2019-04-30T17:37:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
588,Local golf: Brian Richey rides a hot start to a top-20 finish at Web.com event,"It might have been a slower start to 2019 than Brian Richey hoped for. But during the weekend, Richey started fast.

The 32-year-old from Lakeland posted an opening round 63, tying the course record at the Dormie Network Classic at Briggs Ranch near San Antonio. Richey’s 9-under score was matched by Xinjun Zhang, marking Richey’s first post-round share of the lead in 2019.

Richey’s bogey-free 63 included three birdies in his first five holes, and he followed it up by torching the back nine, birdieing six of his final eight holes. Richey’s best round of the year by three shots was even more impressive given that he wasn’t even guaranteed to be in the field.

“I didn’t know if I would be in the tournament at the start of the week,” Richey said. “I kind of reset my season and said, let’s start over.”

Richey cooled in rounds 2 through 4, but never went cold. Richey posted a two-under 70 in round two, dropping him six shots out of the lead, though still within the top 10. A pair of one-under 71’s on the weekend might have been disappointing after his hot start, but still garnered him his best finish of the year in a tie for 19th. The finish boosts Richey’s standing on the Web.com regular season points list by 33 spots to 116th.

“I obviously wish I would have closed out my rounds better on the weekend, but I would have taken t-19th on Monday morning. The season as a whole has been frustrating at times, but I started slow last year and was able to get it going in the summer. I typically start to play well once I have a lot of tournaments in a row. All it takes is a couple good weeks to change your whole season.”

Richey hopes to build upon last week’s success at the Nashville Golf Open, beginning Thursday.

589,"Endangered Tampa boy, 3, who needs medical treatment found in Kentucky","Kentucky authorities took into custody an endangered 3-year-old boy on Monday, hours after Hillsborough deputies said his parents refused to provide him with the medical treatment he needs and instead fled Florida with the child.

TAMPA — Kentucky authorities took into custody an endangered 3-year-old boy on Monday, hours after Hillsborough deputies said his parents refused to provide him with the medical treatment he needs and instead fled Florida with the child.

Joshua “Noah” McAdams was found in Georgetown, Ky., and underwent medical treatment in that state, according to the Hilsborough County Sheriff's Office. The parents are also in custody and will face charges of child neglect.

Georgetown is about 20 minutes north of Lexington. But no information about how the Tampa family was located or captured in Kentucky was released by Florida authorities.

During the search, father Joshua McAdams, 28, was described as armed and dangerous by the Sheriff’s Office. He may have had several rifles with him, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. He was arrested for misdemeanor domestic battery in Hernando County in 2016, but the charge was later dropped.

The exact medical diagnosis and condition for Noah, which is the name the child goes by, was not released by deputies due to health privacy laws. They also did not say why the family refused to seek medical treatment.

But posts on a Facebook page in his mother’s name tell the story of her son’s cancer — and credit his recovery to vitamins, diet and other alternative treatment options.

Child protective investigators obtained a court order to take the boy into custody, the Sheriff’s Office said. But when they went to serve the order, the family had disappeared.

On April 22, according to deputies, mother Taylor Bland-Ball, 22, and the father failed to bring their son in for a “medically necessary” procedure. They also refused to come to a follow-up medical appointment to obtain the “lifesaving medical care” the child needs, according to the Sheriff's Office.

Noah may also have a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC line, in his body.

In early April, posts on the Facebook page noted Bland-Ball’s “baby boy” was at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital and had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Then on April 16, six days before the couple missed their medical appointment, a celebratory post on the Facebook page appears to show Bland-Ball and her son smiling, noting that they “busted on out of that hospital — with no cancer cells left to spare.”

“We did two rounds of chemotherapy, specifically vincristine because they can get a medical court order to force you to do it,” the post reads, before crediting other remedies, from rosemary to grapefruit peel.

Posts on the Facebook page, which was active as of late Monday afternoon, became home to small arguments between people angry at the parents’ actions and others defending them.

The page links to the websites of two businesses: Trinity Caim Birth Services and Herbal Education & Training. Both list “Taylor Bland” as employees. A number for Trinity Caim Birth Services is also listed on separate records for Joshua McAdams. A call from the Tampa Bay Times to the number went unanswered Monday afternoon.

The most recent address for the family was on the 12200 block of Bruce B. Downs Boulevard in Tampa, near University Mall. The Sheriff’s Office said the parents are also known to sleep in state parks overnight.

In August 2016, McAdams was arrested on a charge of misdemeanor domestic battery by Brooksville police. The victim in the case was Bland-Ball, the report said, and it took place while they lived in Brooksville and had been dating for three years. The incident started with McAdams arguing with Bland-Ball, who was holding their son, then just a year old, according to the arrest report.

The father threw a plastic toy bucket at the mother but accidentally hit the baby, cutting his face. McAdams then shoved his girlfriend into a wall “multiple times,” causing a head contusion, the report said. He spent three days in jail, records show, and the case was dropped in March 2017. The mother also filed for a protective injunction against the father, according to Hernando court records, but it was later dismissed.

590,"Properly Posh Baby, a new upscale baby boutique, opens in downtown Pensacola","CLOSE The top names in child's clothing, from Abel & Lula to Lemon Loves Lime, can be found at Properly Posh Baby. The new baby boutique opened in March. Jacob Newby, jnewby@pnj.com

A burgeoning new business below the downtown Pensacola Southtowne apartments wants to make sure your little one is dressed in some of the most stylish brands the children's clothing industry has to offer.

Properly Posh Baby, an upscale baby boutique, opened in March at 150 S. Jefferson St., next door to Old City Market Inc. Owner Kelly Taylor had been running Properly Posh Baby strictly as an online shop for the past two years until the opportunity arose to expand into her first brick and mortar store.

Dresses, tops, bottoms, swimsuits, special occasion lines, accessories and more are sold at the new boutique. The new Pensacola retailer carries dozens of the most popular baby clothing brands in the U.S., and though the selection is bigger for girls, boys clothing is also available.

""Our prices range, like some of our swimsuits are Target-priced swimsuits,"" said Taylor, a 13-year Pensacola resident and Mississippi native. ""The upscale caters more to the environment. And the shopping center here is kind of all upscale.""

Also open at Southtowne

► Old City Market opens downtown — serving everything from soda fountain drinks to produce

► Stay The Spa opens refreshing new space in downtown's Southtowne complex

On the higher end, Properly Posh carries the luxury Spanish brand Abel & Lula, which Taylor said has been donned by a certain toddler in the British royal family.

""This is a brand that ships from Spain and they actually make designer stuff just for Princess Charlotte,"" Taylor said. ""That was the one specialty line I decided to pick up that was higher end.""

The store named by Taylor's sister — or as the Pensacola baby boutique owner puts it, ""the creative one in the family"" — carries everything from newborn sizes up to a girl's size 12. A mother of one, Taylor said she recognized her niche in the retail industry when friends would consistently pick her brain on newborn fashion.

""I've just always had an eye for baby and kids fashion,"" said Taylor, whose job history includes managerial stints at both Victoria's Secret and Coach. ""People always came to me and asked me what to dress their kids in.""

Almost every brand and item on the racks and walls of the cozy 1,000-square-foot boutique can also be found on the Properly Posh website, properlyposhbaby.com.

""It's kind of weird, now that the brick and mortar is here, the online popularity is growing,"" Taylor said.

Other designer brands carried at Properly Posh include Haute Baby, Lemon Loves Lime, Baby Biscotti, Mustard Pie and Baby Sara. The store also sells candles and the popular but elusive Noodle & Boo baby lotion line.

Taylor's shop is still so new that the outdoor signage isn't even up yet. But she said she's received a very warm welcome from downtown Pensacola during her first month and change of business.

""I didn't even know I wanted to be downtown a couple of years ago, but I'm so happy to be here,"" Taylor said. ""The foot traffic with the (YMCA) next door has been great and we're getting a lot of business off the Saenger Theatre when they do the Cinderella shows and the kids shows, a lot of people are here with their families.""

Properly Posh is open seven days a week, from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday and noon until 5 p.m. Sunday.

592,Texting and driving ban headed to governor for signature,"- Law enforcement officers could pull over motorists they see texting and driving on Florida roads, under a bill now headed to Gov. Ron DeSantis.

With a vote of 108-7, the House on Monday passed a compromise measure (HB 107) that blends a ban on texting and driving with a requirement that motorists travel hands-free of wireless devices in school zones and work zones.

Sen. Wilton Simpson, a Trilby Republican behind the Senate effort, had sought to make the hands-free requirement statewide. Simpson is slated to take over as Senate president following the 2020 elections.

The House’s passage of the bill Monday came after the Senate approved a series of health-care measures sought by House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes.

If signed into law, texting while driving would be a “primary” traffic offense. Currently, police can only cite motorists for texting behind the wheel if they are pulled over for other reasons. By making it a primary offense, police could pull over motorists solely for texting while driving.

Continue reading below

Oliva, a Miami Republican, credited the Senate's willingness to compromise for the advancement of the proposal, which proponents have sought for years.

“I think as you saw there was some amendments put on regarding school zones and construction areas where workers are present and a couple of smaller fixes,” Oliva told reporters following Monday’s floor session.

Last week, DeSantis said he supported the House’s efforts to make texting while driving a primary traffic offense.

“This stuff has got to be enforceable,” the governor said Wednesday. “If it’s a primary offense, then people are going to get pulled over. So, you’ve got to make sure that is going to happen. The more you go beyond texting, I just have concerns about the administrability of it.”

Rep. Emily Slosberg, a Boca Raton Democrat who co-sponsored the House bill with Tampa Republican Jackie Toledo, said the state is catching up with the rest of the nation. Slosberg said the goal is to get Florida fully hands-free.

“It means Florida’s roads are finally going to be safer. It’s huge,” Slosberg told The News Service of Florida following the bill’s passage. “This means the safety of Florida’s citizens, Florida’s drivers, and especially Florida’s children, by adding the extra protections in school zones.”

Slosberg, who has followed her father, former Rep. Irv Slosberg, in pushing for traffic-safety changes in the Legislature, called the vote “surreal.”

Emily Slosberg’s twin sister, Dori, was killed in 1996 when a speeding car in which they were passengers struck a median and crashed into an oncoming vehicle.

Toledo said the “blending” of the bills “will make our bill much better.”

Under the bill, changes would be phased in, with ticketing beginning Jan. 1.

From Oct. 1 through the end of the year, only verbal and written warnings would be issued to people stopped for texting while driving.

As part of Simpson’s proposal, county clerks of court would be able to dismiss cases of first-time offenders when violators buy wireless communications devices that can be used hands-free.

Making texting while driving a primary offense has raised concerns among numerous black and Hispanic lawmakers, who fear it would lead to increased racial profiling of minority motorists. Similar concerns helped derail previous attempts to make texting while driving a primary offense.

To address concerns about racial profiling, the bill headed to DeSantis would require officers to record the race and ethnicity of violators, with annual reports of statewide arrests submitted to the governor, Senate president and House speaker starting Feb. 1, 2020.",http://www.fox13news.com/news/florida-news/texting-and-driving-ban-headed-to-governor-for-signature,2019-04-30T02:00:04Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609

Entering this week’s $25,000 Mardy Fish Children’s Foundation Tennis Championships in Vero Beach, Matic Spec of Slovenia, a former standout player from the University of Minnesota, had only one interaction with the tournament’s namesake or the Fish family.

“Back in 2014 during my freshman year, me and my teammate Felix Corwin played in the final of the Big 10 Indoor Championship, Felix ended up winning, but Mardy Fish shared the update on Twitter,” said Spec of Fish, the former Top-10, world-ranked tennis player, 2004 Olympic silver medallist and U.S. Davis Cup captain. “We were all confused on what was going on and then someone told us he was from Minnesota and he follows Minnesota sports very closely.”

Upon arrival in Vero Beach this week to play in his International Tennis Federation (ITF) World Tennis Tour event, Spec, and his former Golden Gopher teammate Corwin were happy to meet Mardy’s father Tom. The tournament co-director, Tom Fish was raised in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, was a University of Minnesota graduate and walk-on member of the men’s tennis team. Fish, and his wife Sally, then opened up their home to the two rookie tennis pros and allowed them to stay with them to offset their expenses.

Spec was the first player to take the court Monday at The Boulevard tennis club and made easy work of the uniquely-named Kahaka’loikamalie Companion of Honolulu, Hawaii, winning 6-1, 6-0 in his first round of the 32-player qualifying tournament.

""I'm happy with the way I played today,” said Spec. “I kinda wanted to get into the rhythm ahead of the upcoming tough matches. I tried to do the things the right way and get a good feeling about the ball and the court, also settling for the next couple of days.”

Spec has been on the pro circuit for almost a year but has lofty goals in the sport.

“My ultimate goal is to reach the Top-100 on the ATP rankings list,” he said. “But I’m trying to develop my game as good as I can in order to win some Futures (entry-level) tournament sand go to the next level. I will give myself a couple of years and see how it goes before deciding what to do next.”

Spec is one of 16 players who won first-round qualifying matches Monday and will play in final-round qualifying matches Tuesday to attempt to enter the event's 32-player main draw.

Several Davis Cup players were also in action Monday. Former LSU standout Boris Arias, a member of Bolivia’s Davis Cup team, defeated Chris Rosensteel of East Windsor, N.J., 6-1, 3-6, (10-6) and Baker Newman of the Davis Cup team from The Bahamas defeated Mwendwa Mbithi of Coconut Creek 6-4, 6-0. Kyle Johnson of Charlotte, N.C., who plays Davis Cup for El Salvador, was defeated by Romania’s Dragos Ignat 6-3, 6-4. Rowland Phillips, who plays Davis Cup for Jamaica, won his first-round match over Mihnea Turco of Romania 4-6, 7-5, 10-6.

""It is my first time here in Vero Beach but I heard really good things about the tournament,” said Arias. “Everyone told me it is very well-organized event and there's a lot of people watching the matches. The atmosphere is great.”

Play continues Tuesday at The Boulevard with the conclusion of the qualifying tournament and first round of main draw singles and doubles. The Vero Beach team of Andrew Butz and Chase Perez-Blanco will play the featured Tuesday evening doubles match at 6:45 pm against Paul Oosterbaan of Kalamazoo, Michigan and Andrew Watson of Great Britain.

Butz is a two-time Florida 1A state singles champion at St. Edwards and added a doubles state title in 2010 as a senior. He reached the third round of the USTA Boys National Tennis Championships in Kalamazoo, Mich., in 2010 and went on to play for the University of Florida.

In 2017, Butz finished in a tie for second in the ""King of the Hill"" competition with Mike Alford of Quail Valley, but graciously ceded the wild card opportunity for Alford to play with event winner James van Deinse. Perez-Blanco is also a former University of Florida standout who ranks No. 6 all-time in school tennis history for most combined singles and doubles victories.

""The King of Hill"" is the annual doubles competition featuring tennis professionals from the Vero Beach area who compete in round-robin competitions on Tuesday nights to the determine the ""king"" of the local tennis professional. Proceeds from ""King of the Hill"" benefit the Youth Guidance Mentoring & Activities Program.

The Mardy Fish Children's Foundation Tennis Championships is regarded as one of the best entry-level professional tennis tournaments in the world.

595,Bonding over burned rubber: Father and son speed test their supercars where space shuttles once landed,"Charles Turner stared through his racing helmet at a seemingly endless strip of concrete where space shuttles once landed.

The world faded as all focus shifted to the 562-horsepower supercar at his fingertips. The bright orange McLaren 570S was ready to show its muscle.

Turner and his son Jonathan, both Naples residents, were part of a rally starting in Naples. Rallies are scheduled events allowing supercar owners to go very, very fast from point to point.

This rally went to Kennedy Space Center to let drivers experience something few people ever will — a drag race on the space shuttle landing strip.

It is the world’s flattest strip of concrete, varying less than one-fourth of an inch over 3 miles, offering plenty of space to top the 200 mph mark — faster than most airliners at takeoff.

“I had 100 percent tunnel vision, focused on that runway,” Turner said.

His grip on the wheel tightened as an official raised the green flag. In three seconds, the car was going 60 mph. His racing helmet slammed into the headrest as the supercar passed 100 mph.

Turner pushed the car faster and faster for the next 60 seconds, perfecting every gear switch and keeping the pedal pressed to on the floor.

The McLaren passed the finish line at 206.8 mph. Turner spun the car around and hit 140 to 150 mph racing back to the staging area. Officials told drivers to speed back to the rally point. The faster a car returns, the more drivers could race.

Charles Turner’s 206 mph run would be the McLaren’s fastest.

His son Jonathan was not thrilled. The orange convertible was his baby, and he barely got over 200 mph.

“My dad kicked my a**, unfortunately, which I’m really mad about because my McLaren, with me driving, hit a top speed of 202, and then he takes it out a half-hour later and goes 206,” Jonathan Turner said.

Racing at Kennedy Space Center

Two dozen cars filled one side of the famous space shuttle runway, marked with skid marks from landings a decade old. The concrete strip, one football field wide, gives the exotic cars plenty of space to rev engines and cool down between speed runs.

Pulse Rally brought the cars together for a four-day excursion across southern Florida, bouncing from Naples to Orlando to Kennedy Space Center. The invite-only event cost drivers thousands of dollars for the unique speed test.

""Driving one of these supercars is like ... when people see this it's like they see Elvis ..."" says Craig Allard, one of the owners of Pulse Rally in March 2019. With their bright colors and loud engine noise, these supercars attracted attention everywhere they went, including the parking lot of a hotel on the east coast of Florida. (Photo: H. Leo Kim/Naples Daily News - USA TODAY NETWORK FLORIDA)

Exotic car rallies are nothing new — speeding along interstates from hotel to hotel is popular with supercar owners — but Pulse wanted to be something different, co-owner Craig Allard said.

“We didn’t want people just going to bars and clubs drinking like fish,” Allard said. “We wanted something big, and that was Kennedy Space Center.”

A 2.3-mile run down the former space shuttle landing strip event fit the bill.

“Being on a runway the space shuttle literally landed — (they) went over our heads a decade ago — that was worth the price of admission itself,” Jonathan Turner said. “Standing there and you can’t see the end of (the runway) — you’re doing 200 mph and you still can’t see the end of the runway.""

Private company Space Florida leases the landing strip, which is owned by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Space Florida allows car manufacturers to use the long space to test vehicles in real-world scenarios. Supercar owners are not normally allowed to use the track. Being in such an exclusive group made the entire trip worthwhile, Charles Turner said.

""It was a monumental moment, because all of us stood on something that most people in this country will never stand on,"" he said.

Sharing a supercar

People react to an exotic car in their own way. Some hang out of a car window going 70 mph on the interstate for a quick photo. Others stop and stare.

During the rally, a row of supercars got stuck in traffic, inching along Interstate 75. Two roadside construction workers honked horns, wanting to hear a Lamborghini engine rev and roar.

“We gave my (Pulse Rally) hat to a very excited kid,” one rally participant, Maya Witt, said. “It was special to them, and I can get another.”

Jonathan Turner both loves and hates the attention an orange McLaren brings.

“Little kids coming up to me at the gas station that want to see the car, and the greatest thing ever is when a kid is like, ‘Can I take a picture of it?’ ” he said. “(I say), ‘Well, do you want to sit in it?’ And you watch their minds explode. Maybe you changed that kid’s potential day or their path in life.

“The other unfortunate part is all the police attention also,” Turner continued. “You’re driving a rolling billboard down the highway, and at some point someone’s going to see you. I’ve had it less than a year, and probably 20 times I’ve been pulled over. Now, the good thing is I’ve not gotten one ticket in the car. So far, the police officers have been very nice. I offer them to sit in it also. It sort of works.”

A father-son experience

Charles Turner owned the only Aston Martin in the group, a 2019 Vantage. The iconic British car topped out at 185 mph.

“Next time, I want to increase the speed from 185 to 195,” he said. “That’s what (Aston Martin) said it’ll do. Well, Aston Martin and I are going to talk. Kind of missed the mark.”

But Charles wasn't driving. Jonathan Turner maxed the car out while his dad reached 182 mph.

The father-son duo topped out each other's cars.

""Yeah, I guess we did trade off,"" Jonathan Turner said.

The Turners were already close — Charles started a financial advising business and Jonathan is growing and expanding — but they rarely shared car experiences. Charles Turner was more a classic and vintage car guy but not so much into the latest and greatest supercars.

“I’m from the old motorhead era back in the late '60s and early-mid '70s,” Charles Turner said.

But Jonathan’s McLaren brought a new perspective on the modern car.

“I thought it was a little small for me — I had to learn how to get in and out of it, which took a little practice,” Charles Turner said. “I liked the looks of it and was slowly getting back to the point where I should maybe consider something for myself.”

Last Christmas, Jonathan Turner urged his father to buy an Aston Martin Vantage.

“It’s kind of cool seeing my dad then wanting to get into it,” Jonathan Turner said. “So, back over Christmas I pretty much forced him to buy the Aston, which is probably the best thing I’ve made him do in a long time.”

Now, after topping his son's speed in a McLaren, Charles Turner is becoming more and more interested in a supercar of his own.

While the duo now share a renewed love of cars, the trip itself was something special, a shared experience they won't likely have again.

""This was the first time with my father legally going over 100 mph anywhere, so we’ve never done track days together,"" Jonathan Turner said. ""But doing this, just sustained fast times on a sanctioned road and runway, is just the coolest thing.""

Finding friends at 200 mph

The four-day trip was more than an excuse to drive cars really, really fast. Nearly every driver said the people made the trip something special.

“You’re with the same people for four days, so you can share stories about how did you get your first car or what did you do to get where you’re at in life and just learning about everyone,” Jonathan Turner said.

“We’re bonding, and we’re all just meeting everyone and hanging out. Now I have friendships out of 40 people that were complete strangers 72 hours ago.”

There were drivers of all ages. Jonathan is 32 and Charles is 64. Some 30-something self-starting business owners mixed with rich retirees, all with one common interest: fast cars.

A huge range of people meant a huge range of cars. The exclusive hybrid Porsche 918 retails at more than $1.5 million. The less expensive supercars had a sticker price of $170,000.

The International Mile Racing Association handled the hyper-accurate timing. Drivers who topped 200 mph received a certificate and place of honor on IMRA’s website. Every driver wanted the title, but many fell short.

Lamborghini Gallardo owner Saqib Assadullah knew 200 mph was a long shot. His bright orange supercar's listed top speed was 201 mph. But the car was pushed to its limits. Asadullah and his girlfirend, Maya Witt, took turns driving the 542-horsepower car.

Nerves kept Witt from reaching a good speed, only hitting 185 mph. But she grew confident, and the couple leapfrogged each other's speeds — 195.1, 197, 197.3 mph. Assadullah topped at 198 mph. While the elusive 200 mph stayed out of reach, he was happy to see his girlfriend and fellow drivers push themselves.

""One one point, (Witt) was above me,"" Asadullah said. ""I was very proud.""

While many cars couldn't break the 200 mph mark, some didn't even survive the rally. A couple of cars broke down along the trip. One McLaren had a nasty internal problem after its first run of the day. A dozen drivers went to problem-solve the engine issues, although the damage was deep in the engine. A tow truck came to the runway after the runs were finished.

A few jokers always kept the atmosphere light and inviting. Jonathan Turner and a couple of other drivers brought spacesuits to the runway, reveling in the space shuttle history and dancing behind an official who was repeating safety protocols.

The Kennedy Space Center trip was Pulse Rally’s first trip — almost a test for events to come. The next step is a summer stop in Scotland, winding among the hills and bogs of the British Isles.

“We wanted to get this under our belt before gaining ground,” Allard said.

The exclusive, invite-only rallies won’t go over 35 drivers, but some eager exotic car drivers on the last trip are already booking overseas tickets.

They wouldn’t miss the next event.

MALABAR, Fla. - With spring comes baby fuzzball sandhill crane hatchlings.

The tall gangly birds are known to be protective parents when it comes to their downy offspring, making it especially jarring when a chick was left orphaned in Malabar this week. Its parents were struck and killed by a car, according to News 6 partner Florida today.

""Somebody just plowed right through mom and dad and just kept going,"" said Heather Pepe with Wild Florida Rescue based in Brevard County.

Malabar firefighters jumped into action Wednesday morning when the crane couple — cranes form lifelong bonds with their mates — were hit by a car on Malabar Road.

After the wreck, the scared chick began to run, and the firefighters gave chase to capture the vulnerable youngster.

Workers with Wild Florida Rescue arrived at the scene a short time later to pick up the chick. Thursday, the month-old crane was transported to Creature Safe Place wildlife sanctuary in Fort Pierce. The bird is doing well and is expected to thrive, Pepe said.

""They're so sensitive, they can sometimes die in captivity,"" she said.

Creature Safe Place has the correct facilities for the bird to be raised in captivity, she said.

Sandhill cranes are an ""imperiled"" species, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. But just because they're protected doesn't mean jail time for drivers who may accidentally hit one. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 sandhill cranes in the wild in Florida.

""You're not going to get cuffed for hitting a protected animal,"" Pepe said. ""But it is very cruel to leave the scene, because the animal might die slowly.""

""A lot of times, we have to pull a carcass to the side of the road because the mate will stand in the road grieving its dead partner,"" Pepe said.

Pepe knows it's sometimes easy to be careless, but she hopes other motorists will exercise a degree of caution in areas where sandhill cranes are known to frequent.

""I see them all the time. They blend in the road. I know it's easy to come up on them pretty quickly. There's always that time to just stop or slow down.""

598,How tiny homes fit all kinds of lifestyle needs in Central Florida,"BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. - Tiny homes are a phenomenon that seems to fascinate who can't imagine abandoning most of their belongings and living in 300 square feet or less.

Barb Lindstrom lives inside 275 square feet of space. It may seem small, but she says it has everything she needs.

""This is the entire bathroom and I'll let you step in. It has everything you could possibly have,"" Lindstrom said as she gave News 6 a tour of her brand-new home.

She shares the space with her husband of more than 50 years.

""This is an entire pantry, which as you can see holds everything you can imagine,"" Lindstrom said.

After the couple analyzed the main areas they used in their former home, such as the living room, kitchen, bathroom and master bedroom, they figured that's all they needed.

""We thought, 'How much do we need?' We only use that space, and at 78 years of age, it's much easier to clean. Today, we got our first electric bill, which was $11.51 because everything is LED lighting. Now, I'm hopeful that they're going to allow more places to put a tiny home on wheels, because we looked all over the state of Florida and there was not a lot of areas that accepted them,"" Lindstrom said.

But that's slowly changing, which according to a tiny home builder is good because the little homes could get big results, since they provide a new option for homeowners to consider to combat the affordable housing crisis in Central Florida.

""With houses averaging in our area I think in the $250,000-plus range, they can get potentially a home that they own and that they're not renting from anywhere from $100,000 and under,"" Mike Cheatham, of Movable Roots, said.

Cheatham said the tiny homes are now being allowed in some neighborhoods both in the city of Longwood and in Brevard County where the commission recently came to an agreement.

""Brevard County now has a new piece of property that has just opened up some lots, it's called Braveheart Properties in northern Brevard, and they actually are gonna be the first ones here in Brevard that will have an actual tiny home community -- both on wheels, like the one you're staying in, and on foundations,"" Cheatham said.

Since the business started two years ago, Movable Roots has been getting results for all types of clients. Recently they built a home for an older man with autism in Pennsylvania.

""They wanted him to live on the property with him, but for him to kind of start getting his own independence and so the home was completely designed around his needs. So what they did is they basically put that home on their property behind their house and got all the proper permitting,"" Cheatham said.

Whatever your needs are, Movable Roots builds a custom home specifically for you.

""Some people have pets. Some people have maneuverability issues that we have to plan a space around their exact needs. Some people have aging family members or potentially a family member that needs to be maybe home but still wants some of that independence. So we just design the space around them, and we haven't built the same house twice yet,"" Cheatham said.

599,Growing optimism for South Florida Avenue 'road diet',"During FDOT open house, residents say lane reductions will bring positive changes, with some reservations.

LAKELAND — Residents who sat down to percolate and collect their ideas on the proposed ""road diet"" for South Florida Avenue found instead of dreading the process, they have a reason to be optimistic about the experiment's results.

More than 150 residents attended the Florida Department of Transportation's open house Tuesday night in Sikes Hall at the RP Funding Center. Each individual was asked to sit through a short video presentation on the project before more than a dozen FDOT and Lakeland officials stood at the ready to answer questions with an extensive display of diagrams to help.

“I think it's the best idea that's ever happened to Dixieland,” Joy McMichael, an East Belmar Street homeowner, said.

McMichael is fully supportive of the one-year pilot program to reduce the number of lanes between Pine Street downtown and Ariana Street from five to three wider ones. She and her husband, Bob, said they've seen the volume of vehicles traveling along the corridor grow exponentially over the past 50 years. Now retirees, the couple said the narrow lanes, sloped sidewalks and speeding vehicles make it dangerous to walk or bike along the roadway.

“I think it's going to help change all the businesses in the area,” her husband said.

The couple has seen a similar measure's positive impact on a small business district in Portland, Oregon, where their son lives.

“Suddenly, there were people from everywhere in Portland, walking everywhere,” McMichael said.

Their optimistic viewpoint was echoed by Dixieland residents Gary and Betsy Kruger, who have lived on both Belmar and Lenox streets.

“You can never get off our street onto South Florida Avenue because of the traffic being so bad,” Betsy Kruger said. “I think it's something that has needed to be done for a long time.”

Gary Kruger, who works as a commercial truck driver, said he would purposefully avoid driving along South Florida Avenue due to the feeling “vehicles are right on top of one another.”

Both worry that while they grapple with the issues daily, drivers who merely travel through the area will stand opposed to the $1.7 million pilot test.

“They are seeing it as inconvenient because it won't be five lanes anymore,” Betsy Kruger said. “If they see it from the view of people who live in the area and have to deal with the traffic, constant fear of walking on the sidewalk — it's different.”

But Edgewood homeowner Vernon Peaslee said FDOT's presentation still leaves him with serious concerns about the impact of restricting traffic on the busy corridor on surrounding side streets.

“The traffic is going to spread out, but it can't disappear,” he said. “Traffic has to have someplace to go so it's going to flow into other neighborhoods. There's nowhere you can put all that traffic.”

Peaslee recognizes that traffic is a growing issue across Lakeland, but said he believes there must be a better solution to the issue.

“To our knowledge, it is the largest road diet pilot program that has been done in the state up to this time,” said FDOT spokesman Brian Rick, also a Lakeland resident. “If it flops, we'll try something else.”

FDOT's presentation did manage to change the opinions of Barbie and Terry Lindsay, two snowbirds from Ohio who live on South Florida Avenue eight months of the year.

“I didn't want them to do this, I'm not generally against change,” Barbie Lindsay said. “But there's so much traffic that the logic of changing five lanes to three didn't make sense to me.”

The couple spoke with Ed Ponce, FDOT's district roadway design engineer, who explained the proposed design and how the four travel lanes would transition into two.

“They came in with some very valid questions,” Ponce said.

Terry Lindsay said the engineer explained how the narrow lanes cause drivers to keep their vehicles staggered out, so the roadway isn't carrying the same amount of vehicles as a typical four-lane highway. Once fearing the road diet would be “a nightmare,” he's now willing to watch when construction to alter the street begins in the spring of 2020.

“Ultimately time will tell,” Terry Lindsay said. “But I've come away with a much more positive attitude these guys know what they are doing and the test of time will prove it.”

601,"Drake breaks Taylor Swift's record at Billboard Music Awards, encourages artists to show love","Drake won multiple honors at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards and encouraged the audience of musicians to give their peers their flowers while they're still alive.

""We've obviously had like an unfortunate series of losses within our business, and I just want to encourage everybody to let other artists know how you feel about them,"" Drake said as he accepted top male artist Wednesday. ""Let them know that you love them (and) respect them while we're all still here.""

Drake could have been referring to a number of deaths in the music industry, from Nipsey Hussle to Aretha Franklin.

The rap star, who walked into Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena with 17 nominations, also won top Billboard 200 album, beating out Cardi B, Travis Scott, Post Malone and the late XXXTentacion.

""Shout-out to Arya Stark for putting in that work last week,"" he said of the ""Game of Thrones"" star who shined in last week's episode.

BTS was also having a major night. At the Billboard Awards and American Music Awards, the K-pop band had only previously won ""social"" awards based off their fanatic fan base, but on Wednesday BTS picked up top duo/group, besting Grammy-winning groups like Maroon 5, Imagine Dragons and Dan + Shay.

""I still can't believe we're here on this stage with so many great artists,"" RM said as fans screamed loudly. ""We're still the same boys from six years ago, we still have the same dreams ... we still have the same thoughts. Let us keep dreaming.""

Imagine Dragons did pick up top rock artist, and band leader Dan Reynolds used his speech to highlight the dangers of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. He earned rousing applause. Florida Georgia Line's Tyler Hubbard followed suit, telling the audience after winning top country song: ""In the spirt of so much truth being spoken tonight by so many talented artists, I think we should speak some truth.""

""As artists we all get to experience so many unbelievable things, but in our opinion, at the end of the day, it's all for nothing if you're not using your platform for better ... to spread love, to help those in needs, to be a light to your community,"" he said.

The show was a family affair: Ciara's husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, and young son danced along while she worked the stage, and Nick and Joe Jonas gave kisses to Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner of ""Game of Thrones"" fame when they sang in the audience before hitting the stage.

Mariah Carey's twins cheered her on as she sang a medley of her hits and accepted the Icon award. She was in diva form before taking the award from Jennifer Hudson, throwing her napkin on the floor after dabbing her face with it.

""Icon? I really don't think of myself that way. I started making music out of a necessity to survive and to express myself and I just wanted to create something so I could feel worthy of existing,"" she said. ""Without getting into all the drama, all the ups and downs of my career ... I guess I always felt like an outsider, someone who doesn't quite belong anywhere, and I still feel like that lost interracial child who had a lot of nerve to believe I could succeed at anything at all in this world. But, and this is the truth, I did believe because I had to. The truth is I dedicated my life to my music — my saving grace — and to my fans.""

Cardi B, the night's top nominee with 21, locked lips with husband Offset on the red carpet and the couple sat closely inside the venue. She will compete for top artist along with Drake, Scott, Malone and Ariana Grande.

""I remember when I first hit the Billboard (chart) at No. 85 with 'Bodak Yellow' — I celebrated that the same way I celebrated all my No. 1s on the Hot 100,"" she said after winning the top rap song honor for ""I Like It.""

Taylor Swift kicked off the show when she brought her new music video to life with a colorful, eye-popping performance of her song ""ME!"" She was backed by dancers wearing bright, pastel colors and her featured guest — Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco — descended from the ceiling holding an umbrella

A marching band kicked off Swift's performance — like most of the world, maybe Swift was inspired by Beyonce's new Coachella film? Dancers also spun in the air holding umbrellas.

Swift is the most decorated winner in the history of the Billboard Awards with 23 wins. She is nominated for two awards at the show airing live on NBC — top female artist and top touring artist.

Kelly Clarkson is hosting the show for a second time — and sang a medley of hits following Swift's performance, from Cardi B's ""I Like It"" to ""Boo'd Up"" by Ella Mai, who won the first award of the evening, top R&B artist.

606,Ready for takeoff: Ocala International Airport,"A new terminal is under construction, runway resurfacing will be done and more companies are looking to move in or expand operations.

Things are ramping up at the Ocala International Airport, with new infrastructure and businesses on the horizon.

Construction of a new terminal is ongoing at the airport on Southwest 60th Avenue and the $6.1 million project is on track for a December completion date. The 17,500-square-foot terminal will consolidate the airport administration; Sheltair Aviation, the airport's fixed-base operator; rental car companies and a restaurant. A couple of offices will be available for rent. Before, the main terminal was a 6,000-square-foot, 60s-era cinder-block building that largely housed the car rental companies.

""We were all fragmented. Now, we are all going to be in one location,"" said Matt Grow, airport director.

The new facility's design also makes future expansions possible, something not possible with the previous building.

The funding for the project came from the Florida Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration, airport funds and the City of Ocala’s partnership with Sheltair.

Later this year, resurfacing of the airports' runways will begin. That multi-million dollar project will take about nine months. Airport traffic will continue throughout the resurfacing. The Federal Aviation Administration and FDOT will cover most of the cost of the resurfacing.

The airport's control tower also will get an upgrade in equipment. The radio equipment in the tower is approaching 10 years of use and is no longer supported by the manufacturer. The FDOT will cover $165,600 of the $207,000 to replace the equipment. The airport will cover the balance.

The seven-story control tower went into operation in 2010 and has air traffic controllers on site 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.

On the business side, several companies are looking to relocate or expand airport operations.

Well Bilt Industries plans to take over the former site of the Airport Rescue Firefighting (ARFF) facility. The company makes hangar doors and would move from its current base in Williston.

The Ocala City Council recently agreed to a five-year lease of the property, at $60,000 and a $150,000 credit to help pay for renovations to the 12-acre property. Well Bilt will build a 10,000-square-foot warehouse and turn the kitchen/locker room building into offices. The ARFF facility opened in 1999 but closed a few years later. Since then, the facility has sat mostly idle.

MzeroA, which produces ground school and aviation safety videos, plans to consolidate its operations in Ocala. The company opened an office at the airport about five years ago and also has a location in Williston. They plan to build a 12,000-square-foot hangar to house their production studio and offices.

The company will pay for the construction of the hangar and lease .82 acres of land from the city for 40 years at a starting rate of $5,702 a year. The rate will increase 3 percent every year after 2020. The council approved the lease during their April 16 meeting.

Ocala Aviation Flight Training hopes to expand and take over the current location of Sheltair. The company started in 2000 with one plane. They now have more than a dozen planes and train local and international students.

Grow also said there is interest from a flight charter company and a helicopter operator, two services once available at the airport, but which went away largely due to the 2008 recession. He credits the robust economy for the uptick in activity.

""What's bringing people here is the economy. The World Equestrian Center is going to change the face of aviation in Marion County. That and other business and growth that is happening in and around Marion County is what's bringing the growth to the airport,"" said Grow, agreeing that the upgraded terminal does make for a more pleasant experience.

The massive World Equestrian Center, which is currently under construction west of Ocala, hopes to draw world-class events to its indoor and outdoor arenas. The facility will include a hotel, restaurants, shopping and a residential community. It is set for a January 2021 debut.

Grow said the area's many horse events, including the Ocala Breeders' Sales auctions and the annual hunter/jumper HITS competition, already account for a significant amount of traffic in and out of the airport.

608,Mystery virus harming turtles in St. Johns River,"0 Mystery virus harming turtles in St. Johns River

The St. Johns River is right down the road for Dante Veale’s home.

She said it’s one of the things she enjoys most about living in Palatka.

“I saw the river and the homes and I just thought it was a beautiful historic area. I feel very lucky and blessed to be here,"" Veale said.

TRENDING:

On Tuesday, she said she’s only seen one freshwater turtle since moving in a year ago.

“We do walk down there on a regular basis a couple times a week. So, yeah, I guess I would be surprised not to see a little more than I do,” she said.

Scientists with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are investigating what’s causing the deaths of hundreds of turtles in the St. Johns River, from Palm Bay to Crescent Lake and Palatka.

Biologists said they’ve received 300 reports of sick or dead soft shell turtles and cooters since March 2018.

Winston Fletcher, the city of Palatka’s cultural resource coordinator said, “Seeing our wildlife healthy is one of our biggest assets that we have.”

Biologists who have studied some of the affected turtles believe a viral infection could be causing the deaths.

They’re asking for the community’s help in gathering more information.

Fletcher said, “We want all the animals to be healthy in their natural habitat and we want to do everything we can to preserve their life.”

“It is concerning because they’re all part of our ecosystem,” Veale said.

The FWC suggests:

Report sightings of sick or dead turtles to the FWC by calling: 352-339-8597 or using the FWC Reporter App . Photos can be uploaded via the Reporter App and will aid researchers in identifying turtles' species and conditions.

. Photos can be uploaded via the Reporter App and will aid researchers in identifying turtles' species and conditions. Do not touch or attempt to move sick turtles.

To avoid spreading the virus, do not capture, transport or release freshwater turtles, even those that appear healthy, to new locations.

Do not eat turtles that appear sick or unhealthy.

610,"Wakulla, Franklin County baseball fight to get out of 'discouraging' districts","The War Eagles are behind Mosley and Arnold in D2-6A, while the Seahawks must navigate past three teams having top-notch seasons

While meeting Monday night on the diamond, Wakulla’s and Franklin County’s baseball teams shared a commonality.

Next week, they’ll be underdogs in districts with some supremely talented programs in front of them.

For Wakulla, it hasn’t had much luck in three-team District 2-6A with Panama City Arnold and powerful Mosley in its path. The War Eagles have just three wins in the past eight years against the Marlins, and they are just 1-13 in the past 10 years against the Dolphins, who have been state runner-up three times in the past six years.

Likewise, Franklin County has to stare down the likes of defending Class 1A state champ Port St. Joe, 1A No. 1 Panama City Bozeman, and a Liberty County team playing for more than itself.

Entering as a top seed or receiving a free pass to the finals and a regional playoff spot isn’t a luxury for the War Eagles or Seahawks.

“It’s discouraging sometimes, but it’s good to be challenged during the season,” Wakulla senior Hayden Lenk said. “This season, we got our first win over Arnold (in a while). Last year, we should have gone farther, but Arnold had (Ryan) Pettys and we just couldn’t hit the ball. Nothing you can do about it.

“It’s frustrating. Brad (Lord) missed one change-up and they hit it out. We lost 3-0. It was a sad bus ride home.”

Such was the fate of the War Eagles amid a 16-8 season in which Lord was named All-Big Bend Pitcher of the Year.

Without a heat-throwing ace, junior Trent Langley (4-2, 1.80 ERA) and Lenk (3-0, 3.40 ERA) have been pitching more to contact, which has recentered Wakulla (13-10) on certain aspects it will need to pull off a district semifinal win against Arnold (10-11).

“We had to focus more on playing good defense,” second-year Wakulla head coach Keith Anderson said. “We have guys that mix speeds up and the ball gets put in play, but they locate and have command of three pitches. That’s another way to get people out.”

Solid all spring in that regard, the War Eagles had to navigate the loss of senior third baseman Jared Roddenberry to an injury mid-season – he was hitting .326 through 16 games – but junior Ian Walker has stepped in well defensively to fill that void.

Lenk, who is hitting .268 and doubled home a run Monday, got the win against the Seahawks during an 8-0 victory. While the score says one thing, the War Eagles secured most of their runs when Franklin County gifted base runners and runs via errors and passed balls.

Conversely, Wakulla had its moments when those same base runners whiffed on key situational moments – tagging up on a deep fly ball or getting forced out at second base on an outfield hit. The War Eagles also struggled to get bunts down and move runners up.

“If we make those little execution mistakes next week it’s going to be tough,” Anderson said. “You gotta play sound and do the little detail stuff.”

Franklin County (12-11) hopes its error-filled performance against the War Eagles proves to be an aberration in an otherwise solid season.

After winning just seven games a season ago, the Seahawks have been playing to the caliber of their competition but not seeing more wins come from it. That can be attributed to mistakes in the last couple innings that have cost them despite holding leads against No. 1 Bozeman (21-2), No. 5 Port St. Joe (15-8), and No. 10 Liberty County (14-9).

“It has been close ballgames, we just haven’t finished,” junior shortstop and No. 2 pitcher Javon Pride said. “Against Liberty, we had them in the sixth inning and started making errors. The game settles down and we get back on our heels, not expecting them to hit the ball.”

Buy Photo Franklin County shortstop Javon Pride waits on a throw while Wakulla's Joseph Pierini steals second as Wakulla beat Franklin County 8-0 on Monday, April 29, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

“When we played against Bozeman, we had them 2-0 in the bottom of the seventh and couldn’t pull through. I walked two batters.”

No. 1 starter Christopher Newell (5-4) and Pride (3-1) both have 1.85 earned-run averages and are limiting opponents to a .180 batting average. While they may not have the win totals they’d like, both are more than capable of shutting down any of their district challengers.

Franklin County as the No. 4 seed would face No. 5 Vernon (8-18) in a quarterfinal game for the right to face Bozeman in a semifinal. The Seahawks won two one-run games against the Yellow Jackets this year.

“I think we can put it together,” Pride said. “I think we can win districts. I think we can make it to state. I don’t see a team that’s better than us when we’re on our A game. I feel we just want it more this year. The senior class we have, they’ve been playing varsity since seventh grade. And they want to go out with a bang.”

For second-year Franklin County head coach Kevin Cox, he’s confident in his pitching keeping the game close. That means getting a timely hit and not making a crucial error goes a long way towards pulling off an upset.

Newell (.426) and Micah McLeod (.422) – both seniors – and Pride (.344) are also the Seahawks’ batting leaders, and they’re trying to lead a team that regularly uses three freshmen and three sophomores in its lineup and in the field.

“We know going into our district that anybody can get anybody,” Cox said. “It’s just finding a way to scratch across a few runs at the right time.

“As we’ve played everyone in this district twice, we’ve gained confidence. They know they can take teams deep into games, and they know they can win. The young ones just need to keep focused and believe they can play in the right moment at the right time.”

Wakulla, which has seen senior shortstop Joseph Pierini hit .373 and senior Trenton Lawton hit .362, would also like to find a clutch hit at an opportune moment. It will need it against the stiff pitching it will face in its district tournament.

Though one of the interesting changes in District 2-6A since last year has been Pettys, a left-handed pitching commit to Florida State, transferring from Arnold to Mosley. That removes one barrier Wakulla will face in the semifinals.

The War Eagles will only see Pettys (5-1, 1.28 ERA) and pitching-loaded, state No. 10 Mosley (20-2) in the district final.

Of course, that's if they should find a way to win back-to-back games against Arnold for just the first time since a 10-game win streak against the Marlins ended in 2011.

“I think we can,” Lenk said. “We’ve got good pitching. We’ve just got to get a few lucky hits here or there if we play Mosley, but I think we can beat them.”",http://rssfeeds.tallahassee.com/~/601436954/0/tallahassee/home~Wakulla-Franklin-County-baseball-fight-to-get-out-of-aposdiscouragingapos-districts/,2019-04-30T17:48:38Z,Tallahassee Democrat,Couple,"277 N Magnolia Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA",FL,32301
611,President of Basecamp Ventures withdraws application for Camp McConnell,"A couple weeks after past accusations of an inappropriate relationship with a student came to light, the president of the company slotted to run a children’s camp on a Micanopy property has withdrawn his application, according to county officials.

Jordan A. Richmond pulled his nonprofit Basecamp Ventures from consideration to run a year-round outdoor education camp on the 212-acre Camp McConnell.

County spokesman Mark Sexton said Alachua County officials will now negotiate with the board of commissioners' second choice to run the camp, Friendship Circle of North Broward and South Palm Beach Inc. The Parkland organization hosts programs for special needs children.

According to Sexton, Richmond withdrew the application to the county attorney’s office on Monday in a phone call, and gave no reason for his decision.

The withdrawal comes two weeks after The Sun reported that Richmond lost his job following a Marion County School District investigation of an inappropriate relationship with one of his students. Richmond was a drama teacher at West Port High School.

The Sun also found Tuesday that some of the people listed as Basecamp's board of directors did not know they were on the board.

At least two of the nine people listed as board members said they never agreed to be on the board.

Gerry Dedenbach, vice president of CHW Professional Consultants, said he had no knowledge of being a board member. He added that though he discussed the possibility of joining with Richmond in the past, he never officially accepted.

Kathleen Schofield, executive director of Northeast Florida Regional STEM2 Hub, said though she worked with Richmond on camps around four or five years ago, she also never officially agreed to be a board member.

Schofield said she was unaware of the accusations against Richmond until told by a reporter Tuesday. She said she informed Richmond she would no longer consider being on the board.

“I find it shocking,” she said. “I will not have an official role with that organization.”

Board member Richard Meachum, of Under the Son Outfitters, said he still stands with Richmond.

“He’s definitely a friend,” he said. “It’s sad to see what’s been said.”

Meachum said the accusations are just “accusations,” and does not foresee leaving the company.

Other board members could not be reached Tuesday.

Witnesses in the Marion County schools investigation said Richmond and the 11th-grade girl were often seen together, including in his office with the door shut. One student said the girl wore his wedding band.

An Ocala police report says the two were found in a minivan behind an abandoned car dealership on a Sunday night in 2016. In the report, the girl told police she asked Richmond to meet in a private location, and she later appeared to be crying and discussing family issues.

In Florida Department of Education records obtained by the county on Monday, a student in the investigation said Richmond sent out a tweet with the numbers 3, 15 and 17 with the caption: “that’s something to think about.” The student said she discovered the numbers were linked to the girl’s 18th birthday.

Richmond denied the post was about the girl's birthday, saying the numbers represented his parents' anniversary date. Investigators later found this was not true through his parents' Facebook, and confirmed the numbers matched the girl's birthday.

Students also said Richmond liked and retweeted the girl’s social media posts that included photos of her wearing a bikini.

Though Richmond was never arrested or charged in the incident, he later lost his teaching job.

Since then, he has been eyeing the Camp McConnell property for his company, which The Sun previously reported had ties to Sen. Keith Perry, R-Gainesville.

Perry threatened to sue the county in 2017 if the county did not allow him buy the land. Though he didn't, his Gainesville roofing company was found in February to have the same address as another now-dissolved company, also called Basecamp Ventures. Perry said he was only involved in advising Richmond about a business plan.

Last week, Perry said he still supports Richmond despite the investigation, saying accusations should be taken seriously but those working closely with kids can sometimes be viewed negatively.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190430/president-of-basecamp-ventures-withdraws-application-for-camp-mcconnell?rssfeed=true,2019-04-30T17:29:27Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Tommy Pham, Yandy Diaz and Ji-Man Choi each drove in a pair of runs, sending the hot-hitting Tampa Bay Rays to an 8-5 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Monday night.

Michael Perez and Kevin Kiermaier also drove in runs for the Rays (19-9), who have won five of six to build upon the best record in baseball. They also moved to 10-2 on the road.

Yonny Chirinos went 5 2/3 innings in relief of effective opener Ryne Stanek, allowing two earned runs on two hits and a walk. Chirinos improved to 4-0 after going 0-3 last season.

The Rays did most of their damage against Brad Keller (2-3), who struggled in his return from a five-game suspension for his role in a fracas with the Chicago White Sox. The big right-hander allowed five runs on six hits and three walks over five innings.

The Rays jumped on Keller in the first when Choi drew a two-out walk, went to second on a wild pitch and advanced to third on a balk. When he scored on Diaz's base hit, Tampa Bay had outscored its opponents 29-4 in the first inning this season.

The Rays added three more in the second after Kiermaier was hit by a pitch, beginning a parade of batters to the plate. Perez delivered an RBI double and Pham provided the big blow with a two-run triple, staking the Rays' pitching staff - with the best ERA in baseball - to a 4-0 lead.

They nearly gave it right back in the third.

The Royals took advantage of an error by Rays shortstop Daniel Robertson and a walk to Whit Merrifield when Adalberto Mondesi tripled to right. He scored on Alex Gordon's sacrifice fly.

Jorge Soler homered in the seventh for Kansas City, but the Rays added a run in the eighth and Choi's two-run double off Wily Peralta in the ninth to put the game away.

FRIENDS IN LOWE PLACES

Rays DH Nate Lowe doubled in the eighth for his first big league hit. The slugger roared through three minor league levels last season and was hitting .300 at Triple-A Durham.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Rays: INF Matt Duffy took some at-bats in extended spring training as he rehabs from a sore back and ailing hamstring. He hopes to return in the next couple of weeks. ""He felt good,"" manager Kevin Cash said. ""Progress is being made.""

Royals: OF Billy Hamilton got another day off after leaving Saturday night's game against the Angels with a sore hamstring. ""That's one of his main strengths,"" manager Ned Yost said of Hamilton's speed. ""I'm going to wait until he's really good, then I'm going to give him one more day.""

616,"Shooter hits 10 Georgia schoolkids, with BBs or pellets (PHOTOS)","ATLANTA — Schoolyard routine turned into chaos Thursday at a DeKalb County elementary school when children began running and parents began getting reports with the words that have become one of their nightmares: active shooter.

It turned out the shots that struck 10 students at Wynbrooke Traditional Theme School came from a BB or pellet gun, and no injuries were life-threatening.

Shortly after lunch, children were on the playground at the Stone Mountain school when shots came from a wooded area adjacent to the playground.

Not knowing exactly what was going on, panicked parents rushed to the school to pick up their children.

Tarik Edmondson was among the first to arrive. “You just panic and you want to get your child,” he told members of the media assembled at the entrance.

Barbara Madison, who lives nearby and had rushed to get her niece, said, “My heart dropped when I heard about it.”

The shots appear to have come from a position away from the school grounds, a statement from the district said. It is not clear if the students were targeted. DeKalb County School District police were still searching Thursday afternoon for the person who fired them.

District officials said there will be increased police presence at the school Friday.

Neither school officials nor school police would confirm if students would be allowed on the playground Friday. A suspect had not been identified.

The access road to the north of the school complex was blocked by police. There’s a small playground on that side of the school where kindergartners and first graders often play — away from the bigger kids. The school goes up to fifth grade. There wasn’t much police presence near the playground designated for older students.

The school system did not give the ages of those who were shot.

Nine students were taken to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston and one was picked up by parents, according to according to hospital spokeswoman Ayana Isles. She said all were in good condition and none had to stay in the hospital.

Caleb Edmonson, 11, told WBS-TV Channel 2 that his class was at lunch when a teacher asked a janitor to lock the doors and close the blinds.

“People started to think it was a drill,” Edmonson said, “but then like a couple of minutes later we saw an ambulance and police officers coming in, running down our hallways.”

A statement signed by Principal Jermain Sumler-Faison said, “There was never a threat of anyone getting into the school building and the remaining students were not injured.”

Several parents told reporters they got very little information from school officials.

“I got a text from Channel 2,” a woman who wouldn’t give her name said. “If it wasn’t for the news, I wouldn’t have known anything.”

Student Mya Mark said she was at lunch when she saw an ambulance pull up to the school.

“I was scared,” she said. “I didn’t know what to do.”

Kevin Johnson said his son was struck in the back by a pellet or BB. The kindergartner was expected to be released from the hospital Thursday, as his injuries weren’t life-threatening.

Johnson was grateful for the quick response of emergency workers and said he’s glad it wasn’t a real gun.

The school was put on a level two lockdown, which means all classroom doors are locked, students and staff are not allowed to leave the classroom and all visitors and vendors in the building must immediately report to the main office.

The Orchards subdivision runs along the north side of the school. Several police vehicles were stationed Thursday on Orchards Walk, the main road into the subdivision, as officers appeared to investigate homes on that side of the school.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190429/shooter-hits-10-georgia-schoolkids-with-bbs-or-pellets-photos?rssfeed=true,2019-04-29T10:52:54Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
617,Caught on camera: Alligators bellowing at Naples Zoo,"CLOSE Have you heard alligators bellow? Three male alligators growl at Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens on Wednesday, April 10. Courtesy of Naples Zoo, Kelsey Burr, Naples Daily News

It sounded like a scene from Jurassic Park: deep growls and guttural roars as birds cried out from above. But these weren't lions, they were three male alligators at Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens.

Zoo staff recorded video of the alligators bellowing on a recent Wednesday morning. Caught on camera were Bubba, Freckles, and Mama — three of the 13 alligators at the Naples Zoo. [Watch the video above to hear them growl.]

In the video, Freckles, who is in the middle, bellows so deeply that he makes a sub-audible sound beforehand that causes the water to bounce on his back called “water dance,"" according to Rachel Myers, the animal care supervisor – ectotherms at Naples Zoo.

Wait —How do you tell the difference between a crocodile and an alligator?

By the way: Tips for living near alligators in Florida

What is bellowing?

""Bellowing gives information about where other alligators are but also the size of others,"" she said.

Their bellows can last for a couple minutes on and off for hours during mating season. Mating season begins in May or June, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

The bellowing helps female alligators find suitable males, usually selecting males that are larger than them, Myers said.

The male alligators at Naples Zoo are all similarly sized and are all larger than the females.

In the wild, the male alligators can also bellow to determine where other alligators are located.

Police in Portland, Oregon are ""shaking their heads"" over a driver's poor decision.

Officers at Portland’s east precinct took to Twitter to post photos of a camper stuck inside of a pedestrian and bike overpass above Interstate 205.

“Shaking our heads over this one,” the tweet reads. Folks, @OregonDOT maintains a couple of pedestrian/bike ONLY bridges over I-205 in the precinct. Shaking our heads over this one. This is at SE Steele St between 92nd/96th.

619,Orange County school board member heading to Capitol ahead of texting and driving bill vote,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - News 6's efforts to drive change are coming to a major vote this week that would make the state's texting and driving law stricter.

The state House of Representatives is expected to vote on House Bill 107, the texting and driving bill, on Monday.

Orange County school board member Angie Gallo is making the drive to Tallahassee this weekend so she can be in the chambers when the House is expected to vote.

""We've come close for a couple of years and it's finally, we're hoping fingers crosses, gonna really get over the threshold and pass,"" Gallo said.

Gallo also serves on the Florida PTA. The organization spent the last several years pushing to make the state's texting and driving law stricter.

The amended HB 107 passed a major hurdle in the Senate last week, after overwhelmingly passing in the House.

[RELATED: News 6 Driving Change timeline | News 6 anchor Matt Austin testifies for distracted driving bill | Could 2019 be the year Florida passes tougher distracted driving laws?]

HB 107 would make texting and driving an primary offense, which means an officer could pull you over if you're caught texting and driving. It also makes it illegal to hold your phone while driving through construction or school zones.

Gallo said the amended provision will keep students safe.

""We have small ones walking to school, riding their bikes. I've seen parents in car line almost hit other cars because they're on their phones,"" Gallo said. ""I think this will bring awareness and I think people will think twice before picking up their phone because it's a primary offense.""

Gallo said she knows it will take time for drivers to change their habits if this bill becomes law. She said she is hopeful this will be the year we drive change and make Florida roads safer.

""Thank you for bringing attention to such an important thing, something we need to pass for such an important matter,"" she said.

620,FDOT crews to double check Brooks Bridge on Monday,"FORT WALTON BEACH ― Engineers will return to Fort Walton Beach on Monday to take another look at Brooks Bridge after a run-in with a passing dredge caused minor damage, officials say.

Florida Department of Transportation District 3 spokesman Ian Satter confirmed Sunday the fender system was struck and suffered minor damage, and stabilizers on the dredge, called “spuds,” scraped the bottom of the bridge, creating a couple of small gouges on the bridge beams.

Officials closed the bridge Saturday night until a team of engineers and divers from FDOT could conduct an inspection to make sure it was structurally sound. The bridge was reopened to pedestrian and vehicular traffic at about 1:25 a.m.

“We’re going to get back to the bridge to assess if repairs are needed,” Satter said.

Investigators from Coast Guard Sector Mobile are looking into the incident, but no other information could be released until they have completed their investigation, said Lt. j.g. Juston Lee of Sector Mobile.

Lee identified the dredge as the Inland Cardinal.

The closure resulted in a massive traffic jam that stretched across Okaloosa Island and all the way into Destin.

Witnesses say the bridge appeared to shake when the stabilizers scraped the underside.

“It hit the bridge hard enough to shake it,” said Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Michele Nicholson.

Shortly after 1 a.m. FDOT tweeted “All lanes open on Brooks Bridge after inspection finds the bridge is structurally sound.”",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190428/fdot-crews-to-double-check-brooks-bridge-on-monday?rssfeed=true,2019-04-28T09:54:00Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
621,Jacksonville-area couple opens up food truck for pets,"A Jacksonville-area couple are using a new concept for their business: a food truck for pets.

Pet Wants Jax Beach offers natural food and snacks for pets, along with other products.

Although it's a franchise, the business keeps its offerings local and fresh. Ice cream, beer and even pig ears are all part of the unique food truck for your furry family members.

""My husband always wanted an Airstream and I always wanted a food truck,"" said Hannah Kim, who owns Pet Wants Jax Beach with Nick Saam. ""And we love our pets.""

Kim and Saam are parents to three dogs. The couple quit their corporate jobs for the franchise, but they're the first to open a pet food truck.

""It's been a blast,"" Saam said. ""We get to spend more time with the people we love.""

They're 10 months in and they've never looked back. Since the ingredients are local and fresh, they donate everything over three months old.

""Our concept is, 'If we can't eat it ourselves, our pets shouldn't eat it,'"" Kim said. ""So if you look at the back of the ingredients, most of our products are five ingredients or less.""

Most of their products are also made in Jacksonville -- labeled ""Eat Local.""

Not only do they have the full-service pet food truck, but they'll also deliver straight to your door, free of charge. This month, they plan to make about 350 deliveries to customers like Janie and her hearing dog, Keen. Janie found out about Pet Wants at an area farmers market.

""He takes a lot of dog food, so it's a heavy weight for me to go and pick up,"" Janie said. ""I also liked how fresh the food was rather than it sitting on a shelf for who knows how long.""

So if you're looking to change up your pet's diet or just give a dog a bone, Pet Wants Jax Beach will come to you.

""We can send you home with free samples from our dispensers or we have a play on beer flights with a dog food flight,"" Kim said. ""You have an opportunity to try out our pet formulas.""

623,"Prosecutors: Dog starved to death after couple filed for divorce, left home","(WFLA) - An estranged Indiana couple allegedly abandoned their dog when they left their home after a breakup and let the animal starve to death.

The Indianapolis Star reports Michael Setser, 31, and Amanda Setser, 28, were both charged with cruelty to an animal, citing court documents.

Investigators say the couple moved out of a mobile home in Greenwood after Amanda Setser filed for divorce, and left their dog Chuck at the home without any food or water.

An anonymous tip led investigators to the home, where they found the emaciated dog dead inside of a cage with no water.

Court documents show Michael called Amanda numerous times and asked her to pick up the dog and her cats because he wasn't going to take care of them, but she refused because she had no way to take care of them. She said she last saw the dog ""alive and healthy"" on Jan. 7.

""Both parties failed to take Chuck with them or provide him with food and water,"" the prosecutor's office said in a news release.

639,Dockside dining: This Cortez eatery honors years of fishing history,"- Florida and fishing: The two are inseparable. And when you grow up here, you are bound to know the best spots to grab a bite – whether catching or cooking.

It’s that hometown heritage that led FOX 13 viewer Sonja Owens to bring Chip Brewster and his Bay Area Best segment to Star Fish Company in Cortez.

“This is a very tightknit community, Cortez is; it’s all fishermen. Generations of fishermen,” explained Sonja. “I can remember when I was in high school and my friend’s dad would come home and it was always the same thing -- he smelled like fish. If we got in trouble, we’d have to clean shrimp and that was just awful. But I can clean a mean shrimp.”

Star Fish Company began in the 1920s purely as a wholesale company. It wasn’t until the 1960s that the retail market was opened and the late 1990s when the restaurant portion came into existence.

They claim to serve some of the freshest seafood you can get at a restaurant and it’s hard to argue. After all, the daily catch from commercial fishermen is brought right next door to the company’s active dock. And it’s not just the amazing seafood that appeals to Sonja.

“There’s tours that come in…you can go out and watch the dolphins. Spend a couple hours out on the water with Captain Kathy or Captain Katie or Captain Patsy and just enjoy yourself and relax. Then on the way back they’ll call in your food order so when you get back your food’s ready, they bring it right out to you so you eat your dinner and you’ve made a whole evening of it,” offered Sonja.

642,Out of the hospital; still in the woods,"An alarm sounds whenever Brenden Charles Fisher stops breathing.

Two or three times each night, it draws his sleepy parents to a crib where they find the baby’s body arched and rigid and his eyes wide open. They suction saliva from his airway and cuddle him back to sleep.

Appointments with doctors and specialists fill each day.

His parents shuttle him from one clinic to the next for a slew of treatments to help their baby breathe, swallow and move.

He also needs a steady supply of medical equipment. Boxes containing new feeding tubes, syringes and gauze pads land on the doorstep regularly. So do dozens of medical bills from various providers totaling more than $700,000, and climbing.

The Sarasota baby who suffered catastrophic brain damage during an attempted out-of-hospital breech delivery with a Rosemary Birthing Home midwife is home now after nearly two months in the hospital.

But his long-term prognosis remains unclear, and his parents’ fight for justice continues despite Rosemary’s recent announcement it will close next month after more than a decade of operation.

“I’m glad Rosemary is shutting down, and I’m honestly surprised it took so long,” said Brenden’s father, Jason Fisher. “But I’m not satisfied. Midwives need to have more education, more oversight, more insurance. I don’t know how the state let this happen.”

Brenden’s injury was the latest incident at the Rosemary, which was profiled last year as part of a nine-month investigation by GateHouse Media and the Herald-Tribune into the dangers of out-of-hospital births.

[READ MORE: Failure to Deliver: How the rise of out-of-hospital births puts mothers and babies at risk, a special investigation by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune and GateHouse Media.]

One of the area’s two birth centers, Rosemary has had a troubled history that includes at least three infant deaths and a rash of hospital transfers. At least one of the deaths was due to a congenital heart defect and not preventable, according to the child’s mother.

Plans for a lawsuit

Fisher and his wife, Paris Bean, checked into Rosemary Birthing Home early Jan. 30, excited to deliver their first child.

Hours later, the baby went into cardiac arrest and respiratory failure after midwife Jordan Shockley unsuccessfully attempted to deliver him breech — foot first instead of head first — without consulting a physician or transferring care as state regulations require.

The baby’s lower half emerged, but his head became stuck in the birth canal and he went into distress. Paramedics rushed mother and child to Sarasota Memorial Hospital, performing chest compressions on his partially exposed body after he went into cardiac arrest.

Brenden was delivered with no pulse or heartbeat and had to be revived at the hospital. He suffered severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and registered no brain activity, according to a hospital spokeswoman and the family.

Doctors transferred Brenden that night to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg. No one expected him to survive.

“He is such a miracle,” Bean said Wednesday from her Sarasota home, where she cradled Brenden in her arms. “We don’t let ourselves get angry. We stay focused on the positives. We have to stay strong for him.”

Brenden beat the odds. He is alive and breathing on his own. He makes eye contact, holds his head up, rolls over, kicks and coos.

But he has not fully recovered, and doctors don’t know if he ever will, the family said.

He has no gag reflex and cannot swallow — all his food comes from a tube. His most recent evaluation returned the same diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy that he got his first day of life.

Caused by a lack of blood and oxygen to the brain, HIE can result in numerous lifelong issues including epilepsy, cognitive impairments, motor problems and developmental delays.

The family hired an attorney and plans to file a lawsuit against both Rosemary Birthing Home and Shockley.

The state Department of Health opened a case on the incident in February, Bean said, but the agency declined to publicly confirm or deny that. If the investigation finds Shockley violated state midwifery regulations, the state can revoke her license.

But such actions are rare.

In the past decade, Florida formally pursued discipline on just 36 of the 170 midwifery complaints — at least 10 involving fatal incidents. It revoked only one license during that time, although six other midwives voluntarily surrendered theirs after facing allegations.

Neither Shockley nor Rosemary’s owner, Harmony Miller, responded to numerous requests for comment.

Rosemary is set to close its doors May 12.

More requirements needed

Florida midwives must have a high school diploma, graduate from an accredited midwifery school and attend at least 50 births under a senior midwife before obtaining their state-issued license.

Unlike certified nurse midwives, they are not required to have master's-level nursing degrees.

Bean and Fisher said that should change.

“I always thought a midwife was a supposed to be a qualified nurse,” Fisher said. “I had no idea they were not nurses. Or that they’re not even considered medical professionals.”

The couple believes Florida should require more education, more clinical experience and more liability insurance for licensed midwives who practice outside the hospital. Currently, the state mandates midwives carry $100,000 per incident and $300,000 aggregate.

It’s rarely enough to cover the cost of a lawsuit, making it difficult to find attorneys to take a case against a midwife, several lawyers told GateHouse Media last year.

Fisher said midwives should have to carry at least $500,000 per incident.

Even that amount wouldn’t cover the family’s medical bills — the flight-for-life helicopter ride alone was $39,000, according to the bill from Med-Trans Air Medical Transport.

Nor would that amount cover the continued care the little boy could require the rest of his life.

But the family tries not to focus on the future. Fisher and Bean said they take it one day at a time.

“Every single day, we walk into his room and say, ‘We need a miracle to happen,’” Fisher said. “And at the end of every day, when we walk out, we realize it was a good day.”

Cuddles and gift cards

Before the baby, Fisher and Bean ran The Green Bean Coffee House on Bradenton Road. They served specialty drinks, fresh juices, sandwiches and pastries to a mostly college-student crowd.

But they closed the café after Brenden’s birth injury — first, so they could be with him at All Children’s Hospital; now so they can be with him at home. They plan to reopen in the fall.

Between the diaper changes and doctor’s appointments, the couple spends time trying to stimulate Brenden’s brain with different activities, like going to the aquarium and getting extra tummy time.

“We also cuddle a lot,” Bean said.

While the café remains closed, the family relies on income from Fisher’s other job doing home repairs, remodeling and maintenance work as The Sandyland Handyman.

They also have received overwhelming support from the community.

“Everybody has been so generous,” Bean said. “We have people bringing us meals, people offering their services. A local church — Sarasota Community Church — dropped off gift cards and gas cards for us.”

And the family’s GoFundMe account raised more than $22,600 from nearly 250 individual donations in the past two months. Money will go toward helping the family get back on its feet.

Fisher and Bean said they’re humbled by the support.

“We have been blessed with so much,” Fisher said. “When you start at rock bottom with doctors telling you your baby is going to die, every day we get with him is a miracle.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190429/out-of-hospital-still-in-woods?rssfeed=true,2019-04-29T04:01:00Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

645,Steps to keep in mind when you recycle your iPhone,"Photo by Oliur Rahman via Pexels Photo by Oliur Rahman via Pexels

- If you are looking to ditch your smart phone, experts say that you have got to be smart about it.

Smartphones dominate our lives and it seems like a new models hit stores every few months. With a new upgrade though comes the e-waste.

James McQuiggan, a local cyber security expert, says that ""when you go to get rid of your phone, there are a couple of things you want to do. You want to erase the content and all the information on there. On the settings in the device, there will be a setting to erase that content.""

Thousands of phones are donated every month to recycling companies across the United States. A used iPhone cannot be re-activated though if the 'Find My iPhone' feature is still on. This feature is handy when trying to stop a thief, but it also stops the recycler from reactivating your phone with a new phone number.

McQuiggan went on to say that ""one of the things with the Apple brand, you want to make sure you turn off the location and find my iPhone because it prevents the phone from being fully erased and prevents them from being able to use it again. You have to disable Find my iPhone before you go ahead and do the full erase.""

To disable the Find my iPhone feature, go to settings and click the Apple ID and iCloud and switch off or disable it.

McQuiggan said that there is another important step to take. ""Once you've gotten all the information erased, and it's back to the facotry settings, then you want to make sure you remove the sim card and either throw it away or destroy it.""

Keep these steps in mind for all of your e-ware from phones to desktops. Any devices sent for recycling that cannot be re-used are broken down and sold for parts.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/steps-to-keep-in-mind-when-you-recycle-your-iphone,2019-04-28T19:48:41Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
648,YMCAs across First Coast offer free swim tests for kids,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Nothing says summer like splashing in a pool or the ocean.

""We live in Florida. There is water everywhere,"" Ashley Schmaltz said.

She is the mother of three children, all younger than age 10.

""They love the pool,"" Schmaltz said.

She said all of her children know how to swim.

""We feel it is very important for the kids to be in the water, to feel comfortable in the water and learn the proper technique,"" Tamara Gibson-Alonso said.

She has two children, ages 5 and 6.

""Seeing them reach milestones, especially when they are in the pool, shows they are growing. They are experiencing a comfortable level of assurance in the water and feel safe,"" she said.

YMCAs across the First Coast kicked off the annual Safety Around Water campaign with a splash.

""The Y actually has a safe-drown water program, which is a drowning prevention program, and it focuses on teaching kids, if they are around a body of water and they happened to accidentally fall in, how they could get back to safety,"" said Katie Huff, an associate at the Williams YMCA.

The program is designed for all levels of swimmers from beginners to the more experienced. The YMCA divides the pools into three zones. The red zone is for first-time swimmers because it is shallow. The yellow zone is for intermediate swimmers and the green zone, in the deepest part of the pool, is for those who can swim anywhere in the pool.

The goal is for beginners to move from the red section to the green and become completely self-reliant in the water at any depth.

Within the past couple of weeks, at least four children have drowned in Northeast Florida.

""He came up this sidewalk, right along this sidewalk, right along the building,” the mom explained to FOX 13. She didn’t want to be identified, but she explained how the ordeal panned out.

“He stopped behind the dumpster out of my view. And he stayed behind the dumpster,” he said. “So I'm like, 'this is weird.'""

Weird, she says, because this may have been the ""man on a bicycle"" parents had been posting about on a private Facebook group. Mothers had been alerting each other of a man who frequently rides his bike on Bauder school grounds around dismissal time.

One of those moms looked up the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s online list of registered sexual offenders and found who they believed to be that man.

""I knew what we were looking for,” she said. “Somebody with longer hair, riding a bike.""

This mom called the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, and not long after, the parents learned they were right.

""They met with me a couple of days later to have me do a photo line-up,” she said. “I knew right away out of the pictures, which one it was.""

Herbert John Saxton, 67, was arrested Friday on a charge of trespassing on school grounds.

Kyle Harden, who is planning on enrolling his children at Bauder, is thankful parents were so vigilant.

As for this mom, she plans on continuing to trust her gut.

""There's no replacement for a mom's instinct. And if it feels wrong, usually it probably is,” she said.

664,Haley Center in Winter Haven seeks to expand free clinic access,"WINTER HAVEN — The Haley Center and two other free medical clinics in Winter Haven serve about a third of an estimated 3,000 low-income residents in the area.

Joe Cole, chairman of the center’s board of directors, said he wants to improve that number over the next 18 months.

The Haley Center, a faith-based non-profit charity, is quietly embarking on a fundraising campaign to raise at least $80,000 over that time to finance purchase of a larger clinic and hire additional paid staff to whittle down that population of 2,000 unserved residents.

Befitting the bare-bones, nose-to-the-grindstone organization, Haley has not kicked off its fundraising campaign with an expensive dinner or other event, said Cole and Clinical Director Donna Armes, the only paid, full-time employee. That would detract from Haley’s core mission of serving uninsured residents with household incomes of 200% or less of the federal poverty level, or $24,980 for an individual and $51,500 for a family of four.

“Our skill set here is better served by treating the uninsured,” Cole said.

The current clinic of about 3,000 square feet is not well designed for the new programs Haley wants to bring to patients, Armes said. The clinic is located at 122 W. Central Ave., across from the Winter Haven Post Office.

“The problem with this building is not so much that we don’t have the space; we have a lot of little rooms,” she said. “We’re talking about space layout.”

Haley is looking for a roughly 4,000-square-foot building with some larger rooms to accommodate some new health initiatives, Armes and Cole said.

One is a fully equipped kitchen, where patients can learn about preparing more healthy meals, she said. Medical research has established that many chronic health problems stem from obesity and poor diet.

The healthy kitchen would not seek to convert patients from their favorite foods, Armes said. Rather, it would teach them how to prepare the foods they love with healthier ingredients.

“We would like to take their favorite recipe and recreate that in a healthier manner,” she added.

Research also shows chronically ill people don’t get enough exercise, and Haley wants to address that with an exercise room available only to patients whenever the clinic is open, Cole and Armes said.

Haley has already taken a modest step toward that goal with a new exercise room it hopes to open in a couple months. But it has only a 10-by-14-foot room for the purpose, enough for a couple of stationary bicycles, a few inflatable exercise balls and other equipment.

A bigger room would have more exercise gear, such as Pilates equipment and elliptical machines, Armes said.

A third new feature for the new Haley Center would be a dedicated room to treat Hepatitis C patients, she said. Medical protocols require isolating such a clinic from other health care areas.

“We would love to have a Hep C clinic,” Armes said. “Nobody (among other free clinics) in Polk County has a Hep C clinic. It’s just not available to free clinic patients. And it’s a very preventable disease.”

In addition to money for a new facility, Haley needs additional funding for paid staff, Cole said.

The clinic has about 40 physicians who volunteer their services plus other volunteer medical and support staff, he said. Besides Armes, it has two part-time employees — a pharmacy technician and a medical assistant.

At the top of the list for hiring would be an administrator, Cole said. That would free up Armes, an advanced practice registered nurse, for patient care.

In its last fiscal year through Sept. 30, Haley treated about 600 people in a total 2,272 medical visits, he said.

Two other Winter Haven area free clinics, Central Florida Health Care and Angels Care Center of Eloise, treated about 400 people, Cole said.

But that leaves about 2,000 people not served in the target population across the Winter Haven metro area, including Wahneta, Eagle Lake and Eloise, he said.

“They go to the emergency room,” Cole said. “You go to an emergency room, you’re treated only for your immediate symptoms.”

But hundreds of those people have chronic health problems, such as diabetes and hypertension, because of their lack of access to regular health care, he added. That’s the cycle Haley would like to break with a new clinic and larger staff.

Haley Center runs on a roughly $300,000 annual budget, Armes and Cole said, and $250,000 of that comes from the county’s half-cent sales tax for indigent health care. The rest comes from donations, including local churches, civic groups and a community foundation that wishes to remain anonymous.

Cole said he and other board members have already approached other local foundations for financial help. He identified three run by Publix Super Markets Inc., the Walt Disney Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., which has a large financial support office in Lakeland.

The First Baptist Church of Winter Haven started the Haley Center in 2005 in the church-owned building. The church still supports the center, including leasing the building for $1 a year, but Haley became a separate 501(c)(3) charitable organization last year.

665,Bucs bolster defense in hopes of helping Winston,"- For the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the NFL draft was all about trying to give Jameis Winston a better chance to succeed.

That not only means surrounding the fifth-year quarterback with playmakers on offense but rebuilding a defense that's been one of the worst in the league since Winston entered the league as the No. 1 overall pick in 2015.

Coach Bruce Arians and general manager Jason Licht began their first draft together since their days of working together with the Arizona Cardinals by selecting five consecutive defensive players over the first four rounds.

They interrupted the overhaul by picking Utah kicker Matt Gay in the fifth round, then finished Saturday by taking little-known but speedy Bowling Green receiver Scotty Miller in the sixth round and Missouri defensive tackle Terry Beckner, Jr. in the seventh.

""Feel really, really good about this one,"" Licht said about the draft haul that began with selecting linebacker Devin White with the fifth overall pick.

Cornerbacks Sean Bunting and Jamel Dean, plus safety Mike Edwards are part of the potential fix for a unit making the transition to a 3-4 scheme under defensive coordinator Todd Bowles after allowing the second-most points in the NFL last season.

Offensive line and running back are areas of need that were not addressed in this draft.

Licht reiterated that the roster is a work in progress.

""We still have time to make some additions if we have to,"" the GM said.

""You can't address every position that you may have some concerns. Whether they vary from big concern to small concern, you can't - it's just impossible to do it in a small amount of time during free agency or the draft,"" Licht said. ""But, we have through August to do what we can.""

WHO THEY GOT

Licht and Arians passed on an opportunity to select the top-rated pass rusher in the draft, Josh Allen, to make White the centerpiece of the defensive overhaul. Bunting could compete for a starting job right away, too, while Dean, Edwards, Nelson and Beckner address the need for depth.

SURPRISE MOVE

Selecting a kicker in the fifth round, No. 145 overall, was unexpected, especially considering the single biggest draft-day blunder under Licht's watch was the decision three years ago to trade up 15 spots to select Roberto Aguayo in the second round, No. 59 overall. The former Florida State star was a major disappointment as a rookie and released after just one season in Tampa Bay.

The position has been problematic for much of Licht's tenure, which began in 2014.

The GM insisted he had no qualms about drafting another kicker.

""To me - and to us - it was a small price to pay to get a kicker,"" Licht said. ""You wouldn't say the same thing for a receiver. If a receiver didn't work out a couple years ago that you took in the second round, would you be afraid to take a receiver in the fifth round? No. This is a very, very important position.""

HOW THEY DID

While they didn't opt for any of the top edge rushers in the draft, the Bucs believe White has the versatility to bolster pressure up the middle, be a run-stopper and excel in pass coverage. With at least two starting jobs open in the secondary, Bunting, Dean and Edwards will be added to a mix of young candidates that include 2018 draft picks M.J. Stewart and Carlton Davis.

""Competition is a beautiful thing in this league,"" Licht said.

WHAT'S NEXT

The Bucs have little flexibility under the salary cap to upgrade the roster and likely will need to release, trade or get six-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy - due to make $13 million this year - to agree to a sizeable pay cut to free up money to sign their draft picks and make other significant moves.

666,FDOT crews to doublecheck Brooks Bridge on Monday,"FORT WALTON BEACH ― Engineers will return to Fort Walton Beach on Monday to take another look at Brooks Bridge after a run-in with a passing dredge caused minor damage, officials say.

Florida Department of Transportation District 3 spokesman Ian Satter confirmed Sunday the fender system was struck and suffered minor damage, and stabilizers on the dredge, called “spuds,” scraped the bottom of the bridge, creating a couple of small gouges on the bridge beams.

Officials closed the bridge Saturday night until a team of engineers and divers from FDOT could conduct an inspection to make sure it was structurally sound. The bridge was reopened to pedestrian and vehicular traffic at about 1:25 a.m. Sunday.

“We’re going to get back to the bridge to assess if repairs are needed,” Satter said.

Investigators from Coast Guard Sector Mobile are looking into the incident, but no other information could be released until they have completed their investigation, said Lt. j.g. Juston Lee of Sector Mobile.

The closure resulted in a massive traffic jam that stretched across Okaloosa Island and all the way into Destin.

Witnesses say the bridge appeared to shake when the stabilizers scraped the underside.

“It hit the bridge hard enough to shake it,” said Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Michele Nicholson.

Shortly after 1 a.m. FDOT tweeted “All lanes open on Brooks Bridge after inspection finds the bridge is structurally sound.”

Lee identified the Inland Cardinal as the name of the tugboat propelling the dredge. According to online records, the Inland Cardinal is an 80-foot, twin-screw tug owned by Inland Dredging Company LLC of Dyersburg, Tennessee.",https://www.thedestinlog.com/news/20190428/fdot-crews-to-doublecheck-brooks-bridge-on-monday?rssfeed=true,2019-04-28T13:16:13Z,The Destin Log,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
667,Canterbury knocked out of boys lacrosse playoffs by Cardinal Mooney for 2nd straight year,"CLOSE Trailing 5-3 after one period, Canterbury could not keep pace with a high-powered Cardinal Mooney offense, as the Cougars are eliminated with a 17-6 defeat Bryan Cooney, bcooney@news-press.com

A promising opening 12 minutes left the Canterbury boys lacrosse team trailing Cardinal Mooney by just two goals and their first playoff victory within reach.

It was not to be Friday as high-powered Cardinal Mooney pulled away in the second period to roll to a 17-6 victory, advancing to the regional semifinals.

In a rematch of an opening-round game from last season's state tournament, Canterbury had home-field advantage. However, it was the road team that jumped ahead in the first period as Cardinal Mooney senior and University of Utah signee MJ McMahon scored his second goal of the game just over halfway mark of the first to put the Cougars ahead 4-1. Goals by Carson Fuchs and Jeremy Barrett scored to pull them within one, but Mooney started to pull away.

""We threw a couple different things at them tonight, maybe it backfired on us,"" Cougars head coach Trent Carter said. ""But you've got to try against the top teams. You have to mix it up a little bit. Our defense has been our power all year, but with their offense, it was tough to compete against those guys. Cardinal Mooney is very good.""

Charles Bell scored two goals to lead Canterbury offensively, with Fuchs, Barrett, Kuper Jenks-Lawson and Luca Comperchio each collecting one goal as the Cougars finished the season with a 12-4 record and their third straight District 18 championship.

McMahon finished with six goals and JP Jackson and Christian Laureano added three goals for Cardinal Mooney (19-1), who will take on Barron Collier on Apr. 30 in regional semifinal competition.",http://rssfeeds.news-press.com/~/601235136/0/ftmyers/home~Canterbury-knocked-out-of-boys-lacrosse-playoffs-by-Cardinal-Mooney-for-nd-straight-year/,2019-04-27T13:21:49Z,The News-Press,Couple,"2442 Dr Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Fort Myers, FL 33901, USA",FL,33901

Four months before Andrew ""AJ"" Freund's parents were charged with his murder, the 5-year-old shared information on possible abuse with a doctor in Illinois.Police responding to a hotline report found a large bruise on AJ's hip in December. At first, he told investigators the bruise came from the family dog.But an emergency room physician noted that AJ later gave a different reason. ""Maybe someone hit me with a belt. Maybe Mommy didn't mean to hurt me,"" he said, according to a Department of Children and Family Services summary of its report.The doctor could not determine the cause of the bruise but said it could have resulted from ""a dog, belt or football,"" according to DCFS. The case was closed a month later for lack of evidence.AJ's body was found wrapped in plastic in a shallow grave Wednesday. His parents, Andrew Freund Sr., 60, and JoAnn Cunningham, 36, have been charged with murder. A pathologist found he died from head trauma due to blunt force injuries, according to a coroner's report.The DCFS released a summary of its records, reports and documents showing its interaction with AJ's family. It detailed numerous encounters with the family, including 17 unannounced visits between June 2015 and March 2016. At the time, the worker did not observe signs of abuse or neglect.Last week, DCFS received another hotline call alleging neglect and inadequate supervision at the home. The call came on the same day AJ's parents reported him missing. Information from the couple ultimately led to the recovery of his body in Woodstock, about 10 miles from their home in Crystal Lake, police said.The DCFS report Friday revealed a long history of child welfare hotline calls with reports of a troubled homelife, squalid living conditions and drug abuse by the parents. Some of those calls predate AJ's birth.In 2012, DCFS was called on Cunningham twice: once on accusations of abusing prescription drugs and neglecting her foster child and a second time for ""environmental neglect and injurious environment"" for her eldest son. Both reports were found to be unfounded and expunged.Two days after his birth, a hotline report was called on Cunningham. Both Cunningham and AJ tested positive for opiates and benzodiazepines. AJ was removed from her care, and DCFS took custody of the infant.AJ was returned to the couple eight months later after both parents took parenting classes and entered a drug treatment program. Authorities have described dog feces and urine throughout the family home, with broken windows and a strong smell of feces where AJ and his younger brother slept.Freund Sr. told a 911 dispatcher that he put AJ to bed on April 17 and by the next morning he was gone.""I got back from the doctor's appointment and I checked in on him to say good morning and he wasn't there,"" Freund told 911. But police say AJ's parents forced him ""to remain in a cold shower for an extended period of time and/or struck"" AJ, according to a criminal complaint filed Thursday.A pathologist found he died from head trauma due to blunt force injuries, according to a coroner's report.Cunningham's attorney, George Kililis, told WLS last weekend that the mother didn't know what happened to AJ ""and had nothing to do with his disappearance.""AJ's younger sibling was in the home until this week, but is now living with another family, DCFS spokesman Jassen Strokosch said.DCFS said it was reviewing its handling of cases involving AJ's family. A caseworker and supervisor have been placed on administrative duty with no casework responsibilities during the review. The agency said it will also review all cases handled by the two employees.""As we move forward, we will be fully transparent with the public as we seek to address any possible shortcomings in this incident and understand how we can better serve the state's vulnerable children and families,"" DCFS said in the summary released Friday.""Protecting vulnerable children who come to our attention is at the core of our mission at DCFS,"" acting director of DCFS Marc Smith said.

671,"Unlicensed contractor with lengthy criminal history accused of grand theft, again","HOLLY HILL, Fla. - An unlicensed contractor with a history of lawsuits and convictions related to a home repair business has been arrested again on suspicious of taking a couple's cash deposit.

Michael Martire, 52, has been convicted multiple times for grand theft and operating without a license, according to court records, but a Volusia County couple had no idea when they hired him for a renovation project that never got off the ground.

When Greg Weaver and Susan Peluso decided to enclose their back porch and add a room to their home, they interviewed numerous contractors first but decided to go with Martire.

""He really walked the walk and talked the talk,"" Weaver said.

In January of last year, the couple hired Martire, with C + M Home Repair.

They signed a proposal outlining the scope of the work and the price $3000 with $1352 paid in cash upfront for materials.

Work was to start immediately according to Peluso, but when two weeks passed and nothing had been done, they thought they had been duped.

""I was so upset, because it was just a financial hardship for us,"" Peluso said.

The couple filed a report with the Holly Hill Police Department, and Martire was eventually arrested.

News 6 found C & M Home Repair has no business license with the state, and Martire is not a licensed contractor, according to the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.

His criminal history goes back to 2002, according to court records. The first time the state attorney brought criminal charges against him for operating as a contractor without a license.

He was ordered to pay a fine.

In 2003, a couple sued him for breach of contract after they paid him more than $40,000, for a renovation he never completed. In that case, he was ordered to pay restitution.

Since then, News 6 has found that over the years Martire has been sued multiple times, and faced criminal charges on several occasions, for writing worthless checks, grand theft and operating without a license, records show.

""They need to do something with him,"" Weaver said. ""He can't keep being allowed to do this to everybody, it's just ridiculous.""

When Martire was arrested in Weaver's case in 2018, News 6 found he was already on probation after being convicted in two other cases in 2017.

Court records show a judge found him guilty of grand theft in Flagler County after taking a deposit for an air-conditioning repair he never made.

He was also found guilty of grand theft in Volusia County for taking a deposit to build a fence he never started, according to the charging affidavit.

""This gentlemen keeps getting away with it,"" Weaver said. ""He'll be out on bail and he'll be trying to get more work from other victims.""

Since Martire is currently out on bond, victims fear it could be happening again.

""He's not gonna stop unless he gets put away in jail,"" Peluso said.

Weaver and Peluso said Martire told them he is a licensed contractor. If you want to verify that someone is licensed, you can check by going to the Florida Department of Professional Regulation website.

News 6 tried to contact Martire using several phone numbers and his listed address but could not locate him.

Police believe an Illinois couple who reported their 5-year-old son missing last week killed him days earlier by beating him and forcing him to stand in a cold shower for an extended period of time, according to court documents released Thursday.The allegations are included in a criminal complaint that outlines first-degree murder, aggravated battery and several other charges against Joann Cunningham, 36, and Andrew Freund Sr., 60, in the death of Andrew “AJ” Freund. A judge on Thursday set bail at $5 million, meaning each parent would have to post 10%, or $500,000, to be released from jail.An autopsy was scheduled for later Thursday to determine a cause of death and to confirm that the remains found a day earlier wrapped in plastic and buried in a shallow grave are those of the child, as investigators believe.Investigators say they found the body a few miles from the family’s Crystal Lake home based on information provided by Freund. Crystal Lake is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Chicago. The couple’s brief court appearance Thursday came exactly a week after Freund triggered a massive search on April 18 when he called 911 to report that the couple hadn’t seen their son since bedtime the night before. Police believe the boy was killed April 15, according to the criminal complaint.Authorities say the boy had lived in deplorable conditions.“It is my hope that you may have some solace in knowing that AJ is no longer suffering and his killers have been brought to justice,” Crystal Lake Police Chief James Black told reporters Wednesday, in a statement directed at the child’s relatives.The Illinois Department of Children and Family Service had a long history with the family — including an investigation that was launched shortly after AJ was born when tests revealed there were opiates in his body that prompted the agency to place the boy in foster care for nearly two years.Crystal Lake police also have repeatedly been called to the family’s house. Officers in police reports described finding filthy living conditions, broken windows, evidence of drug use and the overpowering smell of dog feces.After AJ’s parents reported him missing, authorities immediately placed his younger brother in the custody of state welfare workers.Lawyers from the McHenry County public defender’s office represented the parents during Thursday’s hearing, and it was unclear whether they had hired private attorneys. Judge Mark Gerhardt ordered the couple return to court for a preliminary hearing on Monday.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/police-missing-5-year-old-found-dead-had-been-beaten-put-in-cold-shower/27274533,2019-04-25T18:36:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

680,Law enforcement family picking up the pieces after deadly crash,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - As they work, to survive their deepest pain, Jacksonville police officer Jack Adams and his children, are proving the strength they draw from each other and how they are an inspiration to all of us.

""It's a double edge sword,"" Jack told us, while staring at photos of his wife Cathy in their living room.

""Some days it's hard to see. Some days it brings a tremendous amount of comfort, you know. There's still a part of her here.""

Jack lost his wife, Jacksonville bailiff Cathy Adams, shortly before Christmas last year.

The couple, along with their two high school-aged children Holly and Jake, were all driving home around midnight from watching the Mandarin High School state football championship game in Orlando, when St. Johns County deputies say a drunk driver slammed into the family's SUV.

Jack's physical recovery

Both children suffered minor injuries. Their mom was killed; thrown from the vehicle. Jack was temporarily paralyzed from the neck down.

""I had a C5, C6 fracture,"" Jack said, which explains his limited range of motion. ""The disc in between those two vertebrae was crushed.""

""My spinal cord was pinched. It wasn't severed thank goodness, or I'd be in a lot different situation. I couldn't move anything,"" he added with a hint of amazement.

Even Jack's physical therapists at Brooks Rehabilitation can't believe how far the 50-year-old JSO officer has come.

""When we first met him, he was in a wheelchair still,"" one PT specialist said, looking at him proudly. ""He just ran eight minutes on the treadmill, so I'd say (there's been) a lot of progress for sure.""

We joined Jack during one of his therapy session, just 3½ months after the crash.

""I still have some challenges left,"" Jack told us about his recovery, which he said is expected to take up to 18 months.

Right now, Jack's biggest limitations are shoulder and arm strength.

""Reaching out and reaching up is a big challenge for me,"" he said while using one hand to help the other wipe sweat from his brow. ""I was told the nerves regenerate extremely slowly -- a millimeter per month.""

While it's hard completing at least one hour of physical or occupational therapy every weekday, Jack has no intentions of taking a breather.

""I've got two huge motivators to keep going,"" he said with determination, referring to his son 15-year-old son, Jake, and his 17-year-old daughter, Holly.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Officer Jack Adams, Holly and Jake

Missing their mom

The image of seeing their mom lying motionless on the ground the night of the crash, is seared in the high schoolers' minds.

""I remember being asleep, and then feeling kind of like a jolt, and I woke up when the car was flipping,"" Holly said, recounting the night she initially thought was just a bad dream.

""I remember dad saying, like 'Oh, I can't move,'"" she continued. ""I didn't know where (my mom) was.""

Good Samaritans helped Holly and Jake out of the vehicle, and the siblings hugged each other in what would be a very brief moment of relief.

""I saw my mom, and it really upset both of us,"" Jake said softly.

""Just saw her laying in the road. And I was able to go real close to her because my cheer bag was kind of close,"" Holly said, staring blankly.

She is on the Mandarin High School cheerleading team and had just been celebrating the school's football's victory with her teammates.

""In the back of my head (I knew),"" Holly said but quickly added, ""I was being hopeful (that she would be OK).""

Holly then described how she and her brother knew their mother likely didn't survive.

""You could tell that it was really bad. Just the way that she was kind of laying there and, like, she was unconscious and people didn't want us around there so we knew that it was not going to be good.""

Surviving the pain

Jake and Holly

""I always see it,"" Jake said of the image of his mother lying on the ground. ""It's like I try not to see it, so I try to distract myself but it pops up sometimes, and it makes me sad.""

""...Cause I don't want to remember her like that,"" Holly added, finishing her brother's thought.

""Just keep myself distracted with people and doing something like fishing and playing basketball, or cleaning shoes, or messing with my pets or something,"" Jake said, listing the things he does to take his mind off the crash.

For his birthday last month, Jake's dad got him one of the newest pair of Air Jordan sneakers. And the pets he referred to in his list, include his small bearded dragon.

His mother bought him the cage just before the December accident -- an early Christmas gift in anticipation of the reptile that would call it home. She never got to see Charlie, the bearded dragon.

""I just look at pictures of her when she was happy,"" Holly told us with a beautiful smile.

Jack

At the end of a long day, their dad Jack often turns to his faith.

""In private, quiet times when the hubbub of the day has gone down, when all the visitors have gone home, when it's just you and the good Lord,"" he explained, ""There are times when, you know, it's tough.""

""You just gotta remember that this life is temporary, and it's just a blink of an eye,"" he said with reassurance.

As Jack began to get emotional, he quietly said, ""One day we'll all be reunited.""

When asked if he believes he'll see his wife again someday, Jack answered as though asked a rhetorical question: ""Oh absolutely.""

Good memories help family move forward

Holly

""She would just go out of her way to talk to you no matter what,"" Holly said eager to talk to us about the great times she remembers with her mom.

""I would come home from work like around 10 (pm), really late, and she would go in my room and we would just talk for like an hour. Even though it was a school night or a work night, like, she just went out of her way to make sure you're OK. And I would text her all the time at school and during work,"" she explained.

As a junior in high school, Holly understands why people think the loss of her mother is especially hard on her.

""I just try to remember the things that she had taught me or talked to me about,"" Holly said as if she wants to reassure all those worried about her well-being.

""If I'm in a situation that I don't know what to do, I just kind of think about the advice that she gave me in the past few years about stuff. And if I need anything, I can talk to one of my cheer coaches or a teacher or anything, but, I just look back at things she might've said.""

Holly has found a strong support system in her cheerleading coaches, teammates and their parents.

SLIDESHOW: Adams family memories

Jack

For Jack, wonderful memories of his wife Cathy are endless.

""She always put everybody else first,"" he said matter-of-factly.

""Every event, whether it would be the dogs' birthdays or the kids' birthdays, whatever holiday it was, it was over the top. You know it had to be celebrated,"" he said.

Jack laughed as he talked to us about the years Cathy would dress up as the Easter Bunny for the kids when they were very young, and the time she made him wear a set of Mickey Mouse ears during an entire day at Disney World in Orlando to celebrate Jack's 50th birthday.

He pointed out their wedding portrait over the mantle in their living room.

""We got married in 2001 in Gatlinburg, Tennessee because Cathy grew up going to the mountains as a child,"" he said smiling, staring at the portrait. ""So that's where she wanted to get married. It was just her and I. We eloped! In a little chapel there in the mountains.""

Cathy's favorite things

Jack and the kids excitedly tell us about Cathy's three main loves, outside the three of them of course.

""Her fur babies,"" said Jack, describing the four basset hounds they have, roaming freely throughout their home. ""They're a constant reminder of Cathy because she loved, loved those dogs.""

In fact, Jack explained how Cathy had a hound named Pricilla when he and Cathy started dating.

""Cause my wife was a big Elvis fan!"" he exclaimed, as he leads us away from meeting and greeting the dogs in the backyard, to the kitchen where Cathy dedicated an entire side of their refrigerator to Elvis magnets.

""One Christmas,"" Jack laughed. ""We had a whole Elvis-themed Christmas tree, in addition to the regular one!""

Cathy was also crazy about her 2017 Mustang GT, which hasn't been moved from its solo spot in the garage.

""She insisted (the color be) 'grabber blue,'"" Jack said, shaking his head and chuckling. ""Because there again, her being the Elvis fan, Elvis liked things that were kind of showy and bright, sparkly.""

Jokingly, Jack said Cathy only let him drive it maybe twice: once to test drive it and again to fill it with gas.

""We're going to hang onto it, pass it down to Jake one day, since him and his mom both loved this car so much,"" Jack said, looking over at Jake's wide smile.

Moving forward

There is no doubt that Jack, Jake and Holly are strong together. When we asked Jack about the pressure to now fulfill the role of mother and father for their children, he responded, ""It's impossible to fill Cathy's shoes.""

""Luckily, the kids are really well-adjusted. I couldn't have asked for two better children. I was really blessed. They are extremely intelligent, thoughtful, well mannered. They really make it easy to be a parent,"" he added.

Just like his two children, Jack too has had tremendous support outside their immediate and extended families. But, he said most of the credit goes to his kids.

""When one part goes down, your rally around what's left -- and I think that's what we've done,"" referring to the strong united front the three of them have become as the grieve Cathy's loss together.

And that's what Jack said he prays for.

""First, I pray that the kids are, to keep them healthy and happy, to keep our family unit strong, keep us moving forward,"" he explained.

His next prayer brings tears as he repeats the words he says to God.

""You know, keep Cathy in your loving embrace and that kind of thing, you know, stuff like that,"" he said.

The tears quickly turned to chuckles as he explained his prayer for himself.

""Of course, just pray that you know, to help me heal. It sounds selfish,"" he said humbly. ""But obviously I do want to, you know, that's something I pray about as well.""

It didn't fall on deaf ears the fact that Jack revealed he prays for his children first.

""It doesn't surprise me,"" Holly said, without missing a beat.

""He's always like that,"" she added, as her smile wiped away her own tears.

""He's a great dad, you know,"" Jake said with a determined voice, the loudest we've heard him speak during our entire 20-minute interview.

""I wouldn't trade him for anybody else,"" Jake stated proudly.

Replying quietly, as his limited motion only allows him to stiffly lean toward his son sitting next to him, ""Thank you, buddy.""

682,"Buccaneers turn to draft for kicker, again","Related Headlines Buccaneers: Rookie kicker is not a gamble

- For the second time in four NFL drafts, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have selected one of the best kickers in college football. They can only hope Utah's Matt Gay, the 2017 Lou Groza Award winner, doesn't turn out to be another Roberto Aguayo.

The Bucs took Gay early in the fifth round on Saturday, ending a string of five consecutive selections used to secure help for one of the league's worst defenses.

""He's a big guy with a big leg, and he's also accurate,"" general manager Jason Licht said.

""That's a big selling point. Strong-legged guys that can kick it from far distance usually have some accuracy issues,"" Licht added. ""This guy has not, so far.""

In two college seasons, Gay set a school record with eight field goals of 50-plus yards and compiled the second-best career field goal percentage (86.2 in Utes' history by converting 56 of 65 attempts.

Gay said the Bucs stayed in touch with him in the weeks leading up to the draft but never provided an indication that they had ""extreme interest"" in him. He said he thought he might be drafted in the sixth or seventh round, so he was surprised when the phone rang earlier than expected.

""I got a call, it was a Tampa number. I looked at the board and saw they were two picks away,"" Gay said. ""I was kind of like, 'No way, not right now.' ... It was amazing, honestly.""

Iowa defensive end Anthony Nelson was Tampa Bay's first pick on the final day of the draft, landing with the Bucs in the fourth round after the club added linebacker Devin White, cornerbacks Sean Bunting and Jamel Dean, and safety Mike Edwards over the previous two days. They finished by taking speedy Bowling Green receiver Scotty Miller late in the sixth round and Missouri defensive tackle Terry Beckner, Jr., with the first pick of the seventh round.

In all, six of the team's eight selections are defensive players. Offensive line and running back are areas of need that Licht and coach Bruce Arians did not address in the draft.

""We've stood pat so far,"" Licht said, speaking specifically about the offensive line. ""I say time and time again, we're not lining up tomorrow to play regular season week one. We still have time.""

Gay played two years of soccer at Utah Valley before spending the past two at Utah, where he made all 40 of his extra points and was 30 of 34 on field goal attempts to win the Groza award as the nation's top kicker in 2017.

Aguayo also was a Groza winner during a standout career at Florida State. The Bucs traded up 15 spots to select him in the second round of the 2016 draft, only to release him following a disappointing rookie season.

Gay will compete for a job with incumbent kicker Cairo Santos, who joined the Bucs early last season after one of the team's key offseason acquisitions, Chandler Cantanzaro, got off to a slow start and was cut.

""We've exhausted everything we can to find a kicker. We'll continue to, like every other position,"" Licht said of the decision to select Gay.

""To me, to us, it was a small price to pay to get a kicker,"" the GM added. ""You wouldn't say the same thing for a receiver. If a receiver didn't work out a couple of years ago and you took him in the second round, would you be afraid to take a receiver in the fifth round? No. It's a very, very important position.""",http://www.fox13news.com/sports/buccaneers/buccaneers-turn-to-draft-for-kicker-again,2019-04-29T14:48:53Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609
683,Michael Walker signs with Jags hours after brother's wedding to Naples coach Bill Kramer's daughter,"CLOSE Naples High School graduate Michael Walker, a returner for Boston College, is named to the Walter Camp All-American Team on Saturday, Jan. 12, 2019. Michael Walker, Special to the Naples Daily News

Naples High graduate Michael Walker fulfilled a lifelong dream when he signed a free-agent deal with the Jacksonville Jaguars on Saturday.

And yet, it wasn’t even the biggest news that day for the Walker family.

Michael’s oldest brother John married Katie Kramer – daughter of Michael’s high school football coach Bill Kramer – at a ceremony in Naples. Michael and his brother Brian both performed the duties of best man.

“No. 1, (Saturday) was all about celebrating my brother’s eternal love and happiness with Katie,” Walker said Sunday as family celebratory festivities were still in full force. “Getting picked up (by the Jaguars) on top of that, I couldn’t have been happier. It made a special day that much more special.”

Saturday wasn’t the first big day that blended Walker’s football prowess with his brother’s love for Katie Kramer.

The day John proposed to Katie happened to be one of Walker’s biggest at Boston College. With ESPN’s College GameDay in attendance and a sold-out crowd ready to see eventual national champion Clemson visit Boston College, John popped the question and Katie said yes.

“He had told me about his plan a few weeks before it happened, that he was going to propose to her before the game,” Walker said. “I actually had no idea he did it until I saw it on the scoreboard.”

The words “Congratulations John and Katie” were flashed on the stadium’s Jumbotron during the third quarter, and it certainly took some of the sting off a 27-7 Eagles loss. Earlier in the game, Walker electrified the crowd with a 74-yard punt return for a touchdown. Walker’s only collegiate return touchdown tied the score at 7, as the Eagles hung tough into the second half with the powerful Tigers.

In the days leading up to the wedding, Walker got calls from at least 17 NFL clubs with varying interest of drafting the speedy wide receiver and special teams ace. Two clubs emerged from the pack as the leading candidates – the Jaguars and Oakland Raiders. The final day of the draft was Saturday – putting Walker’s multi-tasking skills to the test as he was fielding calls from his agent throughout the day.

“I had been getting calls all day,” Walker said. “Just before the ceremony was about to begin, I talked to the Raiders’ special teams coach, and he had let me know they had taken their last pick and I wasn’t picked by them, but they were very interested in bringing me in on a free agent deal. I knew the Jaguars still had two seventh-round picks, so I thought I might get taken by them.”

Cooper/USA TODAY Sports)

As fast and furiously as the calls were coming in, they completely stopped during the ceremony and resumed immediately after.

“This was John and Katie’s day all the way, so I’m glad the calls stopped so I could enjoy the ceremony,” he said. “It was all meant to happen that way.”

When the ceremony ended, Walker found out the Jaguars hadn’t picked him and knew he had to find a free agency deal. Since the Raiders and Jaguars were the teams that had shown the most interest, it really came down to what team was a better fit.

“I visited both places (before the draft) and talked to most of the staff for both teams,” Walker said. “I liked them both. But with the Raiders, they weren’t sure what role they’d have for me, they just liked me as an athlete. I wanted an opportunity to play wide receiver, and the Jaguars were willing to do that.”

Walker has been one of the nation’s most dynamic and sure-handed return men for the last four years. He has especially excelled in the last two, leading the nation in combined kick return yardage two consecutive years (1,294 last year, 1,203 in 2017). Walker ranks among the career leaders at Boston College in most return categories, and he had a shot at becoming the all-time Eagles leader in kickoff returns and kickoff return yardage.

Boston College had its Dec. 23 appearance against Boise State in the First Responder Bowl canceled due to the threat of severe weather in Dallas. Walker finished four kickoff returns and 44 kickoff return yards shy of Will Blackmon’s school records of 110 returns and 2,700 yards. Blackmon played at Boston College from 2002 to 2005, later embarking on an 11-year NFL career.

Those numbers came as no surprise to Kramer, who has known the Walker family for 20 years and literally saw Michael grow up. Kramer said he knew from the first time he saw him play, Walker was destined for greatness.

“I had him at one of my camps, he had to be 5 or 6, playing touch football and he was flying around all over the place,” Kramer said. “Growing up, whether he’s been playing football, baseball or running track – he’s always been the best athlete on the field. But more importantly, he’s an outstanding young man who comes from a wonderful family. The Walkers are unbelievable people, faithful people and I’m so happy both our families have come together. Saturday was a big day for the Walker and Kramer families, one we’ll all never forget.”

Although his greatest success came as a return man, he also put up solid numbers as a wide receiver.

His best season came as a sophomore when he played primarily as a receiver and had limited touches in the return game. That year, he hauled in 33 passes for 420 yards and four touchdowns. For his career, Walker caught 71 passes for 847 yards and five touchdowns. He also rushed 19 times for 112 yards for the Eagles.

Walker cited Patriots star Julian Edelman and former Patriots receiver Chris Hogan as players with similar size and pedigrees who attained great NFL success with little fanfare in the draft. Edelman was a seventh-round pick by the Patriots, while Hogan was an undrafted free agent who bounced around a few organizations before finding his niche in New England.

“I know I have the athletic ability to play in this league,” Walker said. “Now I have to go and prove it.”

Walker said he would have chosen any team that gave him the best chance of succeeding, but he’s happy to be staying relatively close to his hometown.

He’s not the only one.

“I was hoping for one of the Florida teams – Jacksonville, Tampa Bay or Miami,” proud mom Bonnie Walker said. “But I would have been happy wherever he went. What a weekend for our family and the Kramer family.”

With John and Katie beginning their married life and Walker starting his NFL career, could the stars align one more time somewhere in the future?

“I’m sure they’re going to have children one day, so maybe,” Walker joked. “I wouldn’t mind if it happened on a day I was playing. I think I’m a good luck charm.”",http://rssfeeds.naplesnews.com/~/601348570/0/naples/home~Michael-Walker-signs-with-Jags-hours-after-brotheraposs-wedding-to-Naples-coach-Bill-Krameraposs-daughter/,2019-04-29T09:53:26Z,Naples Daily News,Couple,"1100 Immokalee Rd, Naples, FL 34110, USA",FL,34110

Nehari Crawford has accepted a mini-camp invitation from the New York Giants.

Crawford, a Fort Pierce Central High School graduate who played his college football at Duquesne University, went undrafted over the weekend. He decided to tryout with the Giants over offers from five other teams.

""It's just really the best fit,"" said Crawford, who made his decision late Saturday night. ""It's a mini-camp invite, so I have to go out there and let them know.""

Crawford said the Pittsburgh Steelers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Cincinnati Bengals, Arizona Cardinals and Los Angeles Rams also invited him to camp.

""My agent (Gus Mustakas) was going over the rosters and then we had a conversation,"" Crawford said. ""I think this is what will work best. I think I have a good chance to make the team.""

The Giants traded All-Pro wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. during the offseason. The team signed Golden Tate as a free agent and added Auburn's Darius Slayton in the fifth round of the draft.

The 5-foot-11, 175-pound Crawford was a first-team All-Northeast Conference selection in 2018 when he caught 71 passes for 1,048 yards and 10 touchdowns.

He is Duquesne's all-time leader in receptions and receiving yards and ranks third all-time in receiving touchdowns. Crawford also could provide the Giants help in the return game as he had 1,369 kick return yards at Duquesne.

While there was disappointment that he didn't hear his name called during the draft, he is happy to have a clear understanding of where he'll play next.

""The worst part is over,"" Crawford said. ""Now I know i'm going somewhere and I have a shot. It's better. I've had to walk around the past couple months with all those emotions.

""Now, it's just play football.""

688,Singer brothers' bond comes with life-saving results,"Brady and Brandon Singer have always had each other’s back.

As children, the brothers looked out for each other and were nearly always together, ready with an encouraging pat on the back or concocting stories to avoid the wrath of mom and dad.

Never once can either brother remember turning in their sibling solely for the satisfaction of seeing him disciplined by their parents. And like most youngsters, they got into their share of mischief, alone and as a team.

Case in point, both remember a time they were playing in their yard as children when, somehow, a window in their house was broken. Rather than point fingers, as many brothers might, and blaming the other, Brady and Brandon quickly dug a hole in the yard and buried the shards of glass, hoping their parents wouldn’t notice.

“We created a bond trying to keep secrets from our parents,” said Brandon, a smile creeping across his face.

Inseparable as youngsters, they’ve grown even closer as adults.

The Singer siblings have never been just brothers; they’re bona fide best friends.

Never has that been more apparent than it has since March 23 — a day their mother, Jacquelyn, calls “the worst day of my life.”

The day she and her husband, Brett, nearly lost a child.

It started as the final day of a whirlwind week for Brett and Jacquelyn. After a spending a few days earlier in the week in Arizona watching Brady go through his first spring training as a member of the Kansas City Royals organization, the couple traveled to Woodstock, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, to watch Brandon chase his dream as a professional flat-track motorcycle racer.

After a relatively routine start to a day at the track, everything changed. Following a restart in a heat race, Brandon was racing up to speed when he was involved in an accident and was sent sliding down the track at upwards of 80 mph.

Suddenly, another rider with nowhere to go, got caught up in the aftermath of the accident and ran over Brandon’s upper torso. His head, protected by a helmet, slammed into the outside retaining wall.

“It was my worst nightmare,” Jacquelyn said.

The accident left Brandon with numerous serious injuries: a collapsed lung, broken ribs, a fracture of his T4 vertebrae and concussion that resulted in memory loss. After the accident, which left him unconscious, Brandon was transported to a nearby hospital where he spent several days while doctors and therapists worked to stabilize his condition enough that he could return to the family home in Lake County.

Brandon’s injuries, serious as they were, likely would have been even more severe — possibly even fatal — were it not for a state-of-art racing suit purchased for him by his younger brother.

The suit was equipped with an airbag, similar to those in automobiles, that was designed to inflate upon impact. It provided Brandon with a protective layer of air around his neck and chest, reducing the possibility of a catastrophic accident.

“There is no doubt that suit along with his helmet — which was provided by a sponsor — saved Brandon’s life,” Brett said. “And he had it because Brady was not at peace unless Brandon had the best safety equipment available.”

Since the accident, Brandon’s relationship with his younger brother — he is 5 years older than Brady — has evolved into something therapeutic, complete with healing unique to them. Immediately after the accident, Brady flew in from Arizona and spent hours in the hospital holding his brother’s hand and challenging him to keep up with breathing treatments designed to lessen the possibly of pneumonia setting in.

Once Brandon was discharged and returned home to continue his rehabilitation, Brady has been right by his proverbial side.

“I talk to him every day on the telephone,” said Brady, a starting pitcher for the Wilmington (Delaware) Blue Rocks, Kansas City’s Carolina League affiliate. “We’ve just always been there for each other and I feel like he needs me more than ever right now. Brandon would do the same thing for me if the roles were reversed. I just want to see him get better.

“We’ve always tried to push each other to do our best and that’s what I’m doing now.”

Brady’s actions after his brother’s accident have surprised no one.

Especially mom.

“They’ve always been so loyal to each other,” Jacquelyn said. “I can’t remember them ever having a serious disagreement. They’ve always done everything together; they’ve looked out for each other and taken care of each other. They even shared the same hobbies. I can’t remember a situation where one purposely tried to get the other one in trouble.”

Both also share an intense competitive drive, which often has pushed them to their many successes.

Like Brady, who was a standout pitcher at Eustis before going on to lead the University of Florida to its only College World Series title in 2017, Brandon was an accomplished baseball player. Following high school, Brandon took his talents Seminole State College in Sanford, where he starred as an outfielder for two years before earning a scholarship to Thomas University in Thomasville, Georgia.

In fact, according to Brady, Brandon might’ve been the better player of the two.

“Brandon played like Pete Rose,” Brady said. “Full speed all the time. He was an unbelievable player; a much better athlete than me. He would run through a wall if that’s what it took. People point out my intensity on the field, but it’s nothing compared to the way Brandon played.

“Just being around Brandon, trying to keep up with him, made me a better athlete.”

At Thomas, Brandon enjoyed a solid career. He hit .295 with three homers as a junior and showcased his defensive chops as a senior, earning a Gold Glove for his work in the field.

Over time, though, Brandon began to lose interest in playing baseball.

“It just wasn’t fun anymore,” Brandon said.

And when it came time for the next chapter in his life, Brandon didn’t have to look far.

Both brothers grew up with an interest in motorcycles. It’s an avocation they likely inherited from their father, who was a professional road racer before giving it up in favor of fatherhood. Eventually, Brandon followed in his father’s footsteps and began a career on flat tracks throughout Florida and the southeast.

He progressed steadily through the ranks in the sport and turned professional about a year ago. Since then, he has left his mark on some of the most-heralded tracks in racing, including Daytona International Speedway.

Clearly, Brandon’s accident has put his racing career on hold. The family hasn’t sat down and talked about a possible return to the track.

Their only concern now is his rehabilitation.

Brandon has shown slow, but steady, improvement since the accident. His physical injuries — the collapsed lung, broken ribs and damaged vertebrae — likely will heal in time.

However, doctors say it could take a year before they will know if Brandon has suffered any permanent brain damage. He has regained some of the memory he lost, but still doesn’t remember the accident that nearly claimed his life.

Regardless, one thing Brandon will never have to worry about is a support system to help him through the difficult days of rehabilitation — physical and mental — ahead. His parents, girlfriend Summer, and countless friends will do whatever it takes to get him over the rough spots.

Meanwhile, Brady will continue to hone his craft and work his way through the Royals farm system. Some have even predicted he could reach the major leagues within a couple of seasons.

He’ll continue to speak with Brandon every day, encouraging and challenging him as they always have. They’ll harken back to their childhood, remembering how they used to work up stories to keep themselves out of trouble.

Even though many years have passed since they buried the glass from that broken window in the back yard and they’ve matured from children into adults, one thing has remained — and will always remain — unchanged.

691,"Viewpoint: Adopt greyhounds, make fast friends","Buy Photo Marlette's Florida Election Cartoons (Photo: Andy Marlette, amarlette@pnj.com)

Have you ever rescued a greyhound? If not, you’re missing out on a gentle companion that could change both of your lives for the better.

Florida’s recent election allowed voters to decide if greyhound racing should be banned.

The voters spoke.

Greyhound racing in Florida will be phased out by Dec 31, 2020.

So what does this mean? It means that commercial dog racing will no longer be in operation. It also means that other forms of gambling at these dog tracks will not be affected (slots and card games).

I am thrilled the ban passed because I have rescued greyhounds, and I know the tales behind the tails.

When I lived in Florence, AL, I vacationed here along the panhandle, more specifically, Destin. The people I traveled with at the time loved going to the Ebro Greyhound Racing Park and Poker Room in Ebro, FL. I didn’t care about the racing part but loved going to pet the greyhounds. They usually had a couple out that you could go visit.

Granted, this was many years ago and I wasn’t sure how I felt about greyhounds being used as racing dogs for entertainment. I did not know how they were treated, and they all looked a little malnourished.

One good thing I can say about this particular track is that they promoted adoption. Because of my few visits to the park, I became involved with greyhound adoption.

After careful consideration, I adopted my first greyhound back in 1997. Her racing name was Laurel, but I quickly changed it to Maggie. She was a black, beautiful girl with a gentle disposition and loving personality.

She wasn’t a good racer and was only two-years-old when I adopted her. The reasoning for this was because she did not make her owners any money. So, instead of allowing her to be euthanized, I made her a member of my family. I didn’t care that her teeth were in horrible shape due to the high protein foods she was fed at the track; I loved her all the same.

She lived to the age of seven, sadly passing away from kidney failure while I held her in my arms. Putting her down was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, but it was comforting knowing that I gave her a chance at life—a life of being spoiled, plenty of hugs and kisses, long walks and a big backyard to run in.

Some argue that greyhounds enjoy their racing lifestyle. Obviously I am not a greyhound, so I wouldn’t know.

What I do know is that Maggie did not have to be in a kennel for 23 hours a day, and she did not have to chase a fake rabbit that she never had a chance to catch, risking injury in the process.

Before Maggie passed, I adopted a big, beautiful 4-year-old gray boy named Maverick. Maverick was a sure fire bet back in his heyday; he made his owners money in the many races he won, as well as the people that bet on him. However, when Maverick tore his right shoulder muscle during a race, he was no longer any use to his owners, so he was put up for adoption.

He could have easily been put down, but thanks to the greyhound adoption program, I was able to adopt him and give him a loving home. He also gained a sister to share his retired racing life with.

There is a slogan that refers to retired greyhounds as “couch potatoes.” Maverick eased into his role as a retired racer as easily as a puppy eases into a warm blanket. He had a big backyard where he could run his laps. Afterward, he curled up in his favorite oversized leather chair.

He was not put into a crate with little to no interaction.

Maverick sadly passed at the age of nine, but he fully enjoyed his retired life. I take comfort in that.

Declining revenue and concerns of animal cruelty have caused 40 states to ban the sport. Florida was one of the last states to hold out, however, Florida is home to twelve of the tracks in the U.S., so this amendment passing was a huge victory for those that oppose it.

Scare tactics were used leading up to the election; those against the ban claimed that 8,000 greyhounds would be euthanized because they will have nowhere else to go. When Massachusetts banned the sport in January of 2010, there was a record for adoptions in the state (according to state records).

I say to you all: There are plenty of adoption programs out there that will take these dogs in. The adoption process ensures that they greyhounds are placed in the right homes, so you can rest assured that your new best friend is a perfect fit.

I cannot recommend adopting a greyhound enough. They are so sweet and gentle, and training them is a breeze. They are already kennel trained, so all that is required is weaning them out of their kennels and into your home.

692,8-year-old Gulf Breeze artist has vision for blind bureaucrats | Andy Marlette,"Some things in life are best explained by a second-grader.

Keep that in mind as the Pensacola Bay Bridge naming committee prepares to convene Wednesday for the task of helping elected officials figure out how to name a bridge.

I know, I know, that doesn’t sound like something so complicated it should require a committee.

And in fact, it wasn’t that complicated for public officials on the Pensacola City Counciland the Santa Rosa County Commission, which both voted to name the new bridge after hometown superhero Gen. Daniel “Chappie” James.

But under the influence of passive-aggressive undermining from state legislators Alex Andrade and Doug Broxson (who perhaps prefer honoring career politicians instead), Gulf Breeze City Council members failed to even vote on the issue.

And after Commissioner Jeff Bergosh publicly rationalized segregation-era race relations and Commissioner Robert Bender surgically removed his own spine, Escambia commissioners voted to manufacture a committee in order to figure out something that should have been elementary.

What's in a name?: Santa Rosa and Escambia counties differ on naming Pensacola Bay Bridge after Gen. Chappie James

Meet Whitney: Gulf Breeze student wins state award for Gen. 'Chappie' James drawing

Which brings us back to the wisdom of a second-grader.

PNJ reporter Jake Newby introduced readers to Gulf Breeze Elementary School student Whitney Morrill in a story a couple weeks ago. The 8-year-old artist brought home Florida’s top prize in the governor’s statewide Black History Month student art contest with a pictorial tribute to Gen. Chappie James.

The winning piece was an elegant composition referencing the hometown initiative to name the new bridge after James. In her interview with Newby, Whitney said she was inspired by learning ""that he was the first African American to get four stars in the Air Force.""

For her achievement, Whitney traveled to the Governor’s Mansion in Tallahassee, where she was honored personally by Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida’s First Lady Casey DeSantis. How about that for winning over an influential public endorsement for the Gen. Chappie James Bridge?

At the core of Whitney’s artistic insight is the instinct that most folks here at home know in their heart — that the bridge should be named after Gen. Chappie James, a fitting symbol to a man who bridged so many profound aspects of what it means to be American.

Unfortunately, an 8-year-old’s instinct is not something some local politicians possess. Her ability to conjure an image and bring it into existence is not a skill they are equipped with. Despite administrative staffs and taxpayer-funded resources, men like Broxson, Andrade, Bergosh and Bender have failed to do what young Whitney can accomplish with crayons and colored pencils. Unlike 8-year-old Whitney, some grown men have no vision.

Alas, that’s why we have artists in this world. To show us the way when we have become too blind — or too bureaucratic — to see. So as the Pensacola Bay Bridge naming committee comes together May 1, the good members should find their mission far easier than their appointing politicians made it out to be.

Committee to weigh in: Should new Pensacola Bay Bridge be named after Gen. 'Chappie' James?

They won't need convoluted analysis of commissioners or the exasperated excuses of legislators to reach a decision on naming the bridge. The answer has been illustrated so clearly. By those who have spoke in support of Gen. Chappie James' legacy at public meetings. By those who want to create a striking public monument to the man at the base of the renamed bridge. And now, by the artful hand of 8-year-old Whitney Morrill.

Some things in life are best explained by a second-grader. And apparently, that includes teaching a few local politicians humility, honor and common sense.

693,Canterbury knocked out of lacrosse state playoffs by Cardinal Mooney for second straight year,"CLOSE Trailing 5-3 after one period, Canterbury could not keep pace with a high-powered Cardinal Mooney offense, as the Cougars are eliminated with a 17-6 defeat Bryan Cooney, bcooney@news-press.com

A promising opening 12 minutes that left the Canterbury boys lacrosse team trailing by two goals left the Cougars feeling that their first playoff victory was within reach.

It was not to be Friday as the high-powered offense of Cardinal Mooney pulled away in the second period to roll to a 17-6 victory, advancing to the regional semifinals.

In a rematch of an opening round game from last season's state tournament, Canterbury had home-field advantage this time around. However, it was the road team that jumped ahead in the first period as Cardinal Mooney senior and University of Utah signee MJ McMahon scored his second goal of the game just over halfway mark of the first to put the Cougars ahead 4-1.

Canterbury responded with a goal from Carson Fuchs and a nifty run and finish from Jeremy Barrett to pull the Cougars to 4-3. After Cardinal Mooney increased their margin to 5-3 right before the end of the first period, they scored again to open the second but Canterbury was awarded a power play with a chance to cut the deficit back down to two. Cardinal Mooney killed off the man advantage and would tack on four goals to end the first half to put too much distance for Canterbury to come back from.

""We threw a couple different things at them tonight, maybe it backfired on us,"" Cougar head coach Trent Carter said. ""But, you've got to try against the top teams. You have to mix it up a little bit. Our defense has been our power all year, but with their offense, it was tough to compete against those guys. Cardinal Mooney is very good.""

Charles Bell scored two goals to lead Canterbury offensively, with Fuchs, Barrett, Kuper Jenks-Lawson and Luca Comperchio each collecting one goal as the Cougars finished the season with a 12-4 record and their third straight District 18 championship.

McMahon finished with six goals and JP Jackson and Christian Laureano added three goals for Cardinal Mooney (19-1), who will take on Barron Collier on Apr. 30 in regional semifinal competition.",http://rssfeeds.news-press.com/~/601235136/0/ftmyers/home~Canterbury-knocked-out-of-lacrosse-state-playoffs-by-Cardinal-Mooney-for-second-straight-year/,2019-04-26T22:44:14Z,The News-Press,Couple,"2442 Dr Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Fort Myers, FL 33901, USA",FL,33901

Unicorp National Developments President Chuck Whittall said he paid a nonrefundable deposit for a $23 million contract that includes nearly 50 acres underneath the mall. The developer is still negotiating with Bancorp, the building's owner.

Whittall said he plans to tear down the mall and redevelop the land as an open-air entertainment space with restaurants, a move theater, a bowling alley, apartments and a hotel.

""It's got a million people within just a couple miles,"" Whittall said. ""It's a great development opportunity.""

Unicorp National Developments renderings of plans for the 46-acre Fashion Square Mall property.

The mall, which was originally built in 1973, is Orlando's oldest and faced challenges as Florida Mall and The Mall at Millenia opened. Online shopping has taken the biggest chunk out of mall traffic in recent years.

Whittall said his company's development doesn't plan to compete with online retailers.

""We're not really trying to compete with the people shopping online today,"" he said. ""That's why the things we'll do are a hair salon, a nail salon, a bowling experience, a dine-in movie theater. Those type of things you can't buy on the internet.""

There have been efforts to revitalize Fashion Square in the past but many of the store spots are currently empty. Flagship store Sears closed in 2016 but a clearance Dillard’s and Macy's remain.

Unicorp is starting on the design plans next month and could demolish the mall building by this time next year.

""Our goal is to demolish the entire mall as it is today and rebuild it into a lifestyle center,"" Whittall said.

696,Holocaust Remembrance event features original play,"The play, ""The Ghosts on the Wall,"" is based on the family letters of longtime Gainesville resident and University of Florida faculty member Ken Wald.

This year's Holocaust Remembrance Program will feature an original play.

In past years, the program has usually drawn speakers from the ranks of Holocaust survivors, but as those survivors age, that has become more difficult, said Philip Schwartz, an organizer for the event, put on by the Jewish Council of North Central Florida.

The play, called ""The Ghosts on the Wall,"" is based on the family letters of longtime Gainesville resident and University of Florida faculty member Ken Wald.

Wald's grandparents, Curt and Regina Schoenwald, tried more than a year to get a visa to enter the U.S. as Jewish citizens in Germany began to face deportation. In that time, they exchanged more than 200 letters with their son in America. The couple died in the Sobibar concentration camp in 1943.

Their letters form the basis of the play, which will be performed by Actors' Warehouse actors.

Wald, a UF distinguished professor emeritus in political science, and the playwright, Christopher Maly, will take part in a question-and-answer session following the performance.

The program, free and open to the public, begins at 7 p.m. Sunday at Congregation B'nai Israel, 3830 NW 16th Blvd. in Gainesville.

Before the play, there will be a commemoration of events that led up to the Holocaust and a candle-lighting ceremony to honor the memory of those who died in it.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190426/holocaust-remembrance-event-features-original-play?rssfeed=true,2019-04-26T15:15:46Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
697,"Autistic man, 19, struck in face, robbed of phone in Fort Lauderdale","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Fort Lauderdale police are searching for two thieves who attacked an autistic man and robbed him of his phone in Fort Lauderdale.

The incident was reported shortly before 9:30 p.m. Wednesday on the beachside of A1A near Beach Place.

According to an incident report, the 19-year-old victim was in Fort Lauderdale with his parents on vacation and wanted to walk along the sand and listen to music on his iPhone while his parents were eating on the patio of The Ritz hotel.

Police said the victim was approached by two black men in their 20s who asked him for money while he was sitting on a lounge chair on the beach.

Authorities said the victim hesitated because he was confused by the question, at which time the thieves repeatedly struck the victim in the face, kicked him and stole his iPhone 6s.

According to the report, a married couple riding their bicycles nearby saw the victim rolled up on the ground, covering his head from the repeated blows.

Police said the husband yelled at the attackers to stop, and they complied. The man told police that one of the thieves told him, ""He took my phone and we are just taking it back.""

The victim's parents, meanwhile, attempted to track their son's location on his phone, which showed it was located in the 3000 block of Valencia Street. But police said soon later the location was no longer available.

The parents then walked over to where the emergency vehicles were and discovered their son had been attacked, authorities said.

Police said the victim's lips and cheeks were swollen from the attack. He also suffered abrasions to his face.

Anyone with information about the attack and robbery is asked to call Detective E. Kirtman at 954-828-6070 or Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477.

A Melbourne man has been charged with attempted murder after he attacked his former roommate with a landscaping machete, an arrest affidavit shows.

Xerxes Havis, 47, was located and arrested Wednesday in Palm Bay by the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office GAMEOVER Task Force.

Havis remains jailed on $500,000 bond at the Brevard County Jail Complex. He will be arraigned May 28 at the Moore Justice Center in Viera.

The machete attack took place just before 10:30 p.m. Monday in a home on Sandpiper Court in the Quail Ridge neighborhood, next to Wickham Park off Croton Road, Havis' arrest warrant states.

The victim told Melbourne police Havis, a past roommate, had showed up unexpectedly and asked to sleep on his couch for a couple of days. The victim asked Havis to leave Monday — and after arguing, the two men began physically grappling, an affidavit states.

Havis grabbed a machete from a shelf near the front door and struck the victim's left forearm, breaking it and causing a deep laceration, police said. The confrontation moved into a bedroom, where Havis sliced the left side of the victim's face and his lower back, inflicting deep lacerations.

The victim screamed for help, and Havis fled, the affidavit states.

The incident marked the third Melbourne-area machete attack reported this month. On April 1, officers responded to a homeless camp in a wooded area off Sarno Road after a man attacked another with the bladed lawn tool.

Earlier this week, a homeless man slashed and injured a victim at an Indialantic homeless camp off State Road A1A, near Pine Tree Drive. The suspect, Ronald Basco, was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

Police ask anyone with additional information in the Havis case to call Detective Cahalan at 321-608-6467.

699,Naples couple's rescue of shelter pup to be featured on CBS's 'Lucky Dog',"Lizzie is a lucky dog. She is lucky to have escaped the California wildfires, lucky to be cared for in a shelter, lucky to get top training, and lucky to find new owners in Naples.

Now the 2-year-old border terrier is scheduled to be featured on the CBS TV show “Lucky Dog” this Saturday at 12:30 p.m.

The show features animal trainer Brandon McMillan, who rescues difficult to love and untrained dogs from animal shelters. At his Lucky Dog Ranch, McMillan tackles the task of transforming the dogs into model pets. Each episode features a hopeless-to-home story of a dog and the family that adopts the canine.

Lizzie was adopted in September by Linda and Jim Hansen who live at Naples Lakes Country Club. She was a dog the Hansen’s never thought they would get.

Five years ago the couple lost their 17-year-old dog. They didn’t want the hassle of training a new puppy.

“So I was watching 'Lucky Dog' and they train dogs,” Linda Hansen said.

She sent them an email and then filled out a lengthy application. Years went by and they heard nothing.

“Five years go by and I get an email that said, ‘You have been chosen,’” Linda Hansen said. “They sent us pictures and they said you can choose one from the pictures.”

The dog they chose had been sent back to a shelter.

“I said, ‘Go get that dog. That’s the one we want,’” Linda Hansen said.

Next came a very lengthy Skype session as McMillan tried to determine exactly what further training the 22-pound terrier needed. The Hansens have some hearing impairments so the canine was trained to alert them if the doorbell or phone rings.

“When the doorbell or the telephone rings she runs around in a circle,” Jim Hansen said.

The couple also enjoys boating, so Lizzie was taken on a boat to become accustomed to that lifestyle.

“We told them in our interview that we had an old sailboat in Doctors Pass so that is why they took her out on a boat in the Pacific to make sure she was not nervous getting in and out of a boat, and she just jumped in and out of the boat,” Jim Hansen said.

In September the Hansen’s flew to Los Angeles to fetch Lizzie and to be filmed for the show. Production crews came to Naples a few weeks ago to get additional footage of Lizzie in her new home.

Lizzie lives a lucky life in Naples.

“She is up at seven o’clock in the morning almost like an alarm clock,” Jim Hansen said. “She licks my nose. We get on the golf cart. I have a 16-foot extension leash and she runs alongside the golf cart.

""She runs very, very fast. She runs all the way around the circle almost two miles. She does her doggie things. Then she has her breakfast and then lies down and goes to sleep.”

In the afternoon it’s either another golf cart run or a walk.

“In the evening we will take her out and then she loves to sit on the raised spa by the swimming pool and watch the sun setting,” Jim Hansen said. “Every night she will watch the sun go down.”

She watches television with her owners and then has a bedtime routine.

“She goes to sleep on my shoulder in bed, and when I fall asleep she gets down and burrows under the bed,” Jim Hansen said, explaining that border terriers are instinctive burrowers.

Lizzie follows commands immediately. She knows, ""sit,"" ""stay,"" ""come,"" ""no,"" and more.

“Never in my life did I think I could get a dog like this,” Linda Hansen said. “She is highly trained. No problems, no messes.”

The Hansens are excited about all the adventures they have had and the people they met while filming the show.

“They were here for six hours last month,” Jim Hansen said. “They took us down to our sailboat and filmed us on the sailboat so some of those scenes will be on the show, too. We look forward to seeing which scenes they took will be in the show. After the show she will just go back to being a house dog.”

""Lucky Dog"" premiered in September 2013. Since then almost 150 episodes have aired. In 2015 McMillan won the Daytime Emmy for best host for a lifestyle series. The show received a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Special Class Series in 2016.

While the Hansen’s feel lucky to have Lizzie, they also say Lizzie is lucky in so many ways.

“With all those fires in California, there were a lot of animals,” Jim Hansen explained. “She was running around on the streets when they (the shelter) got her. This was when a lot of dogs were displaced from the fires. One other thing that makes her lucky is we flew out to Los Angeles and got her and a week later that huge fire went through the hills. So she escaped two in a row.”

That is how Lizzie got her name. Linda Hansen said her dog’s full name is Elizabeth, named after Elizabeth in the television show Madam Secretary. But she is called Lizzie because of her history.

“She is lucky Lizzie,” Jim Hansen said.

708,First group completes UCF program for disabled students,"ORLANDO — After dropping off their daughter Patricia at her college dorm for the first time, Mike and Nancy Moody were so nervous they booked a room at a nearby hotel for a week, just in case their youngest child needed them quickly.

""As parents, we were very happy this opportunity came up for Patricia but this is a big, huge, campus and we were afraid of letting go,"" Nancy Moody said.

But the couple, who lives an hour and a half from the University of Central Florida's campus, where Patricia attends, saw little of their daughter that first week because was already immersed in campus life and activities.

Almost four years have passed, and Patricia, who has Down syndrome, is now completing her program at UCF. She's one of 13 students, the first in school history, who will complete a program designed for students with intellectual disabilities this spring. On Monday, Patricia and her peers attended a ceremony at the Burnett House, the on-campus president's residence. They'll also be able to walk in the university-wide commencement events next month.

Students in the program, which is part of UCF Inclusive Education Services, aren't seeking bachelor's degrees, though they take courses designed to prepare them for their adult lives and careers and receive a credential intended specifically for them. They can also take regular UCF courses, though they don't receive grades or college credit. The program is intended for students with IQs of about 75 for whom a traditional college experience isn't an option, said Adam Meyer, director of Student Accessibility Services and Inclusive Education Services.

The program typically lasts five semesters and costs about $40,000 for in-state students, including meals and housing, though some scholarships are available. To date, 24 students have enrolled. Many of them live on campus and participate in clubs and activities with other UCF students.

""This is truly a UCF opportunity — something that our UCF community has come together to create for these students, and it's really hard to put into words what this opportunity means for these students and their parents .,"" Meyer said.

Several of the students completing the program this spring already have jobs lined up, Meyer said. Others will go back to their parents' homes and decide what to do next.

The first six students enrolled in the UCF program in 2015 after former Florida Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, who has a son with Down syndrome, urged the state to provide more opportunities to students with disabilities. Although then-Gov. Rick Scott vetoed money for a statewide job training center for people with disabilities, UCF forged ahead with the pilot program, which was already in the works.

Nationally, a growing number of colleges and universities are welcoming students with intellectual disabilities. More than 200 campuses offer programs designed for them, according to Think College, part of the Institute for Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts Boston.

Students and families raved about the UCF program after Monday's event, eagerly listing off their clubs and activities and talking about making friends with their roommates and classmates.

Like the Moodys, some of the parents who attended the event said they were initially anxious, even hesitant, about sending their children to a large university. One mother, Kimetta Ortiz, remembered receiving frequent calls at midnight or 1 a.m. from her son, Matthew.

""I don't know if I can do it,"" he told her.

Ortiz, who lives in Hernando County, told him she believed he could. Eventually, she said, ""I stopped getting those calls.""

Now, Matthew Ortiz plans to stay in Orlando and has already lined up a job working in the cafeteria at a local charter school. His friends and church are here and ""he's seen too much to come back,"" said his mom, who plans to move to be closer to her son.

Classmate Patricia Moody plans to return to her parents' home in Vero Beach as she searches for her next opportunity. She'd like to work with law enforcement, she said, doing something that involves helping people with special needs.

When she left home for UCF, Moody was 32, a little older than most of her peers. She'd been teaching sign language at schools in her hometown. She kept telling her parents she wanted to go to college.

But, her parents said, a program like the one at UCF ""didn't exist."" Most structured education for people with disabilities ends at age 26. That changed when Mike Moody received an email about a new opportunity at UCF.

Patricia Moody quickly found her way around campus, joining the sign language and College Republicans clubs and getting involved with Best Buddies, which pairs people with disabilities with typical peers.

""I was blown away,"" Nancy Moody said.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190427/first-group-completes-ucf-program-for-disabled-students?rssfeed=true,2019-04-27T16:08:51Z,The Ledger,Couple,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815
709,"Armed Winter Haven home invasions don't phase great-grandmother: ""Get that thing out of my face!""","Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (WFLA) - Detectives with the Winter Haven Police Department and the Polk County Sheriff's Office are working together to determine if a string of similar, violent home invasions this week are connected.

In both cases, two bad guys forced their way into the homes and threatened those inside with guns. Winter Haven PD told News Channel 8 Friday that investigators just didn't have enough information to say definitively if they're the same suspects or not.

It started on Tuesday morning when two armed men wearing face masks broke into 74 year old Chris Barnett's home on 6 St. NE. As Barnett was getting her great-granddaughter ready for school, the suspects forced their way into the house and told Barnett to get down.

Despite the threat, Barnett says she wasn't afraid.

""I ain't scared of this goon. He got it right in front of my face, he could have blown my brains out,"" Barnett told News Channel 8. ""I said get that thing out of my face!""

Barnett says the suspects took off over her backyard fence with cash, clothes, and her guns. When police canvassed the area, they found surveillance video of a man they believe to be one of the suspects but didn't catch the suspects themselves.

Wednesday afternoon, a very similar home invasion went down on Dillion Street, about five miles from Barnett's home. Polk County investigators say two black males, armed with semi-automatic handguns kicked down Michelle Biggins' door and ransacked the home.

""They kicked the door in, went into the room where my mom was at, and put a gun to her head."" Biggins explained.

A red Hyundai Sonata was captured on home security parked a couple doors down.

""I just pray to God that they catch them,"" Biggins said.

While Biggins is leaning on her faith to find the suspects, Chris Barnett just says the cops better get them before she does.

""I don't know who you is, but if I ever find you...God bless you, babies,"" she warned.

Heartland Crime Stoppers is offering a cash reward for information that solves either, or both, of these cases.

711,Baby sandhill crane rescued after hit-and-run kills parents in Malabar; taken to Fort Pierce sanctuary,"With spring comes baby fuzzball sandhill crane hatchlings.

The tall gangly birds are known to be protective parents when it comes to their downy offspring, making it especially jarring when a chick was left orphaned in Malabar this week. Its parents were struck and killed by a car.

""Somebody just plowed right through mom and dad and just kept going,"" said Heather Pepe with Wild Florida Rescue based in Brevard County.

Malabar firefighters jumped into action Wednesday morning when the crane couple — cranes form lifelong bonds with their mates — were hit by a car on Malabar Road.

After the wreck, the scared chick began to run, and the firefighters gave chase to capture the vulnerable youngster.

Workers with Wild Florida Rescue arrived at the scene a short time later to pick up the chick. Thursday, the month-old crane was transported to Creature Safe Place wildlife sanctuary in Fort Pierce. The bird is doing well and is expected to thrive, Pepe said.

""They're so sensitive, they can sometimes die in captivity,"" Pill said. Creature Safe Place has the correct facilities for the bird to be raised in captivity.

Sandhill cranes are an ""imperiled"" species, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. But just because they're protected doesn't mean jail time for drivers who may accidentally hit one. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 sandhill cranes in the wild in Florida.

""You're not going to get cuffed for hitting a protected animal,"" Pepe said. ""But it is very cruel to leave the scene, because the animal might die slowly.""



""A lot of times, we have to pull a carcass to the side of the road because the mate will stand in the road grieving its dead partner,"" Pepe said.



Pepe knows it's sometimes easy to be careless, but she hopes other motorists will exercise a degree of caution in areas where sandhill cranes are known to frequent.

""I see them all the time. They blend in the road. I know it's easy to come up on them pretty quickly. There's always that time to just stop or slow down.""

712,"SWFL Recruiting: Jacob Tracey a Raider again; ECS, SFCA and Canterbury athletes sign","Riverdale's Jacob Tracey takes a shot against St. Petersburg. (Photo: Bob Quinn/Special to The News-Press)

USA Today Network-Florida writer Bryan Cooney will be regularly reporting on the recruitment of Southwest Florida athletes. If you have any news on a local athlete receiving an offer, making a visit, committing or signing, please email Bryan at bcooney@gannett.com.

Jacob Tracey will play for one of the top junior colleges in the country as the former Mariner, Riverdale, and SFCA star signed with Northwest Florida State College.

Tracey had signed to play for Blinn College in Texas after his senior season with the King's, but wound up playing this past season at DME Sports Academy, a post-graduate school in Daytona Beach.

""I went up against top post-grad schools in the country and I got a lot better being over there,"" Tracey said.

CLOSE Jacob Tracey scored 26 points and Jadrian Tracey added 25 as Riverdale beat Estero 79-67 on Wednesday. Here's a look at the highlights. Bryan Cooney

The 6-foot-4 guard garnered Division-I offers from Coppin State and Canisius over the course of the year. Because Tracey was deemed as a transfer after signing with Blinn, if Tracey had decided on going to another college after his season at DME, he would have had to redshirt because of not having college credits.

""I could of went and redshirted at a couple schools, but I want to play,"" Tracey said. ""I'm going to try and get some more offers and I should if I keep working.""

Tracey's younger brother Jadrian, who last played at Oldsmar Christian in Orlando, but transferred back to Riverdale after basketball season, has an offer from Canisius. The Traceys would welcome the possibility of playing for the same college as they did two years ago to help SFCA make the 3A Final Four.

""We've already got one of the same offers, so hopefully we can go together,"" Tracey said.

Northwest Florida State was a thorn in the side of Florida SouthWestern, handing the Bucs two of their three defeats this past season. The Raiders went 28-5 and advanced to the Elite Eight of the NJCAA Division I National Tournament.

• Canterbury senior Simon Wilbar will play basketball next year at Lincoln Memorial University in Rock Hill, South Carolina.

The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 16.4 points and 8.8 rebounds a game in his senior season with the Cougars and was selected to The News-Press All-Area second team. Wilbar went for 20 points or more 10 times and had a season-high of 31 points against First Baptist Academy on Dec. 11.

Canterbury finished 2019 with a 17-12 record and were District 3A-6 runner-ups, a season after making the 3A Final Four with Wilbar averaging 10.1 points per game as a junior.

The Railsplitters compete in Division II's South Atlantic Conference and went 20-9 this past season.

• Three student-athletes from Southwest Florida Christian signed on Tuesday to continue their careers in their respective sports.

Isaiah Paulec will run track at Southeastern University in Lakeland after a strong high school career that will be completed in the next two weeks with the regional and state meets still to come. As a junior, Paulec was named to The News-Press Track and Field second team after a fifth-place finish in the high jump at last year's 1A state championship.

Bryce Santarelli will play football at North Central College located in Naperville, Illinois. The 6-foot-4 senior had 41 receptions for 368 yards and caught three touchdowns on offense and racked up 9 ½ tackles for loss and 3 ½ sacks on defense for the King's.

Paige Flint will play volleyball at Southwest Virginia Community College in Richlands, Va. after completing her senior season with the King's, compiling 66 kills and 199 digs.

713,American Cancer Society seeks more drivers to take patients to appointments,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Cancer patients must constantly go to treatment and doctor visits, but sometimes getting to those appointments can be a challenge because they might not have someone to take them. That's where the American Cancer Society's Road to Recovery program comes in.

""It's meant a lot to me because it gave me the opportunity to help people,"" Francis Grossi, a volunteer said. Cancer patients need daily or weekly treatment, sometimes spanning several months.

Two to three times a week, Grossi drives patients to their critical appointments.

""I wanted to do something more personal with the patients,"" Grossi said.

About 10 years ago, Grossi came across American Cancer Society's Road to Recovery program. It's a free service for patients who don't have a vehicle or don't have anyone to drive them.

""The whole purpose of Road to Recovery is to have that one on one personal service with the patient,"" Debbie Coover, a South East regional trainer for the program, said.

For instance, Grossi drives from Orlando to the Moffitt Cancer Center frequently. She has a couple of patients that she's been driving for several years back and forth, Coover said.

""What's really great about the way it works now is, the driver has the opportunity to choose how far they want to drive, how often they want to drive, what days they want to drive,"" Grossi said.

However, the organization has hit a small bump in the road. They're in need of more drivers so that they can continue to get results for cancer patients in Central Florida.

""As the treatments are growing and growing with the medical advances that are happening, outpatient treatment is the way that we're progressing,"" Coover said. ""The more drivers we have, the more likely we are to be able to fill the rides for the patients that we have.""

Rides are needed primarily Monday through Saturday. Drivers interested in being part of the program must have a valid drivers licenses, proof of insurance and a fully functional car. They'll also have to go through a screening process and have a good driving record. Drivers must also take an online course as part of the training.

""Maybe you have a few hours in the morning, whatever you can do -- it'd be such a help to these people and they appreciate it so much,"" Grossi said, adding volunteering comes with unexpected perks.

""It's been a wonderful opportunity. I've met so many wonderful people,"" she said. ""I've made some very close friends -- to see a lot of Florida that I haven't seen. I take rides in a lot of areas I've never been to.""

If you are interested in volunteering, call 1-800-227-2345 or visit www.cancer.org/drive.To request a pick up, patients need to contact same number and give a minimum of three-day notice in advance.

Bloodsaw, 18, graduated last year from Baker County High School. He was a well-known and well-liked standout on the Wildcats football team. His parents said he kept straight As and never got in trouble.

It was a somber week at Baker County High. News4Jax was told Bloodsaw had attended the school's prom a couple weekends ago with his girlfriend, who is a senior.

According to his obituary on the Forbes Funeral Home's Facebook page, Bloodsaw's achievements at the Baker County High included being a state champion with the weightlifting team and a state runner-up with the Wildcats football team, as well as excelling in the classroom. He attended Bethany College in West Virginia for some time.

""William will be remembered for his joking nature, as well as his kind heart,"" the obituary reads. ""He loved people and was a friend to all who knew him.""

The funeral home says his family will be receiving friends from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Friday, May 3, at Christian Fellowship Temple in Macclenny.

A homegoing service will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday, May 4, at Christian Fellowship Temple. He will then be laid to rest in Macedonia Cemetery in Macclenny.

Thoughts and condolences for his family can be left in an online guestbook at www.forbesfuneralhome.net.

718,Former city manager Higginbotham dies,"Former Gainesville City Manager William Dillard “W.D.” Higginbotham Jr. died last week at age 77.

Not everyone who knew W.D. Higginbotham knew what his initials stood for, though he was quite popular among the people in cities he served.

In fact, most news articles and TV reports that mentioned him over his 35-year career — including a five-year stint as Gainesville's city manager — rarely bothered to elaborate on his name. His wife, Dona Higginbotham, asserts no one knew it.

But to those who did know the man with a signature mustache that would make Tom Selleck jealous say he was an utmost professional who cared deeply for his friends and family.

William Dillard “W.D.” Higginbotham Jr. died last week at age 77 from a lung infection, a complication after being diagnosed with lung cancer. He had five children and eight grandkids.

“He was everybody’s grandpa and everybody’s friend,” his wife said.

Born in New Orleans in 1941 to Hazel and William Higginbotham, W.D. was one of five kids. His mother gave him the nickname to not confuse him with his father. He quickly became the man of the house at age 15 after the death of his father, a U.S. merchant marine. Hustling at restaurants and delivering newspapers, he helped his mother pay the bills.

“He was never too proud to do anything,” his wife said.

He graduated from Tulane University in 1968 with a degree in accounting and later earned an economic development degree from the University of South Florida.

A quick glance at his resumé proves finding work came easy.

Higginbotham served in various roles for at least seven cities around the state. He was assistant finance director for Rosewood City in California and assistant city manager in Bakersfield, California, before landing in Gainesville.

He held the title of Gainesville city manager from September 1984 through April 1989.

Former Gainesville Fire Rescue Chief Don Harkins, who worked for the city throughout the former manager’s tenure, said that W.D. Higginbotham was pro-public safety, largely due to his background in California and seeing wildfires and earthquakes. Once he came to Gainesville, he added, it was obvious that first responders and their departments were a priority.

“He had a soft spot for public safety,” said Harkins, who now works as an assistant fire chief for Seminole County. “I think the years that W.D. was there, the fire and police departments flourished.”

When not visiting with family or traveling, he enjoyed going to football games. As a UF football season ticket holder, even after leaving Gainesville, his wife said he enjoyed being anywhere near the university. Most of the time, he could be found in a Florida Gators T-shirt, as Gator gear made up a bulk of his wardrobe, his wife said.

He liked soul food, barbecue and Cajun foods. One of his newer favorite Gainesville restaurants was Sweetberries Eatery and Frozen Custard, located at 505 NW 13th St., she said.

“He just so loved Gainesville,” his wife said. “We both do.”

Former City Commissioner Todd Chase first met Higginbotham while the late manager worked as an employment recruiter. Chase said he always knew him as someone highly regarded around the state who made lasting impacts in cities he served.

“He once told me his time in Gainesville was one of the most meaningful times of his career,” Chase said.

After leaving Gainesville, Higginbotham was named director of economic development for the North Central Florida Regional Planning Council. During his tenure there, he met and married his wife Dona.

He served as manager for Surfside, Melbourne Beach and Madeira Beach and was president of the Treasure Island Chamber of Commerce. He was a financial adviser for the International City/County Management Association and Department of Defense during 2005 in Baghdad, Iraq. Most recently he served as senior vice president for the Mercer Group, an executive search firm for government jobs located in Daytona Beach where he lived out his remaining years.

“It was like everywhere we went, someone always knew him,” his wife said.

Dona Higginbotham said her husband would always be retiring, but that it never lasted more than a few months.

Last summer, those job opportunities took a backseat when the former city manager was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began receiving daily treatments at UF Health Shands Hospital soon after.

Higginbotham was a smoker up into his 40s, his wife said, but had quit more than 30 years ago. There was no sign of cancer throughout the years, she added.

“It was quite a blow,” she said.

For nearly a year, the couple felt optimistic that he'd beaten the disease.

The couple had returned from one of their dream vacations in Europe last month, where they visited Paris, London and Rome, where he climbed the Spanish Steps three times in a single afternoon, she said. But it wasn’t until after the trip that they found he had a deadly infection in his lungs.

“He was never sick a day in his life,” she said. “He had the energy of a 35-year-old.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190425/former-city-manager-higginbotham-dies?rssfeed=true,2019-04-25T18:14:35Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
719,Vindication for Gillum? Not really | Our opinion,"CLOSE Andrew Gillum reaches settlement with ethics commission Tallahassee Democrat

“Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, that he is grown so great?”

Early in Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar,” Cassius asks Brutus what’s so hot about the Roman leader, who appears to have an ego trait that’s afflicted politicians through the ages.

The higher they go in public office, the more they become convinced that they can accept favors from lobbyists and courtiers surrounding them without being influenced.

And when caught taking extravagant favors, the reflex reaction of all public figures is to admit as little as possible — and then commend themselves for taking responsibility for the mistakes they minimize.

We saw it for years in the Florida Legislature, which finally clamped a “gift ban” upon itself, vowing its members would no longer accept so much as a ham sandwich or cup of coffee from the lobbyists clamoring for their attention. That ban, unfortunately, does not apply to city and county officers.

And so it is that former Mayor Andrew Gillum was able to persuade himself that he could have a good time in New York — taking a Statue of Liberty cruise in the harbor and seeing the Broadway smash “Hamilton” — with a lobbyist pal and a couple guys who were posing as business investors wanting to set up shop in Tallahassee. He was similarly incurious about actual costs when his buddies invited him on a little vacation at a villa in Costa Rica, at bargain rates.

The story: Andrew Gillum settles ethics case, agrees to $5,000 fine

Document: Read the settlement agreement in the Andrew Gillum ethics case

It all came back to bite him when Gillum was nominated for governor by the Florida Democratic Party, losing by a margin so close it went to recounts. The Florida Commission on Ethics found probable cause for an investigation and, on Wednesday, Gillum reached a settlement with the commission to avoid a public hearing in which the commission sought testimony by his brother, Marcus, and an undercover FBI agent who had posed as one of the businessmen so generous to the mayor in his vacation travels.

He agreed to pay a $5,000 civil fine for accepting an unspecified gift.

“Today is vindication,” Gillum said in a statement afterward. “The results confirm what I’ve said all along — the facts matter and I never knowingly violated any ethics laws.”

Not quite.

Vindicated people don’t pay $5,000 fines. And if Gillum, as mayor, didn’t “knowingly” accept expensive favors from people seeking favors from his city, it’s because he didn’t try to know. And certainly, nothing says “trust me” like delaying a public hearing for a couple hours while lawyers confer privately with the Ethics Commission staff.

The negotiated settlement no more vindicates Gillum than the Mueller Report absolves President Trump of ethical culpability for his official actions or personal conduct. To keep their actions just barely this side of the law, remaining technically not prosecutable, is not a standard to which we expect our leaders to aspire.

The Ethics Commission settlement is still subject to ratification by the nine-member panel, but that shouldn’t be a problem. Gillum is out of office and his prospects of a political comeback will be severely hampered by the ethics investigation and its negotiated outcome.

We don’t necessarily think Gillum acted corruptly. We think he was blind to the obvious reason behind the blandishments of business interests trying to butter up the mayor of a city that had something to offer them — or to withhold. He’s certainly not the first high-ranking public official to think he could dine at their table and still fairly consider their business proposals.

We’d have more confidence that Gillum, and other local politicians, had learned from this experience if he forthrightly took responsibility for his own actions, rather than claiming the deal he struck with the Ethics Commission amounts to “vindication.”

The backstory:

► Judge denies request to keep Andrew Gillum's brother from testifying at ethics hearing

► High drama, twists and turns possible as Andrew Gillum's ethics hearing starts

► Tangled Web: See how subpoened people, organizations are connected

► Gillum team lashes out at Ethics Commission as judge blocks hearing delay

720,State issues stop on sale of certain fuel at Fernandina Beach gas station,"FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. - After a couple told News4Jax fuel from a Fernandina Beach gas station caused their car to break down, the state announced it's stopping the sale of certain types of gasoline at that location.

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued a stop sale order at the Flash Foods gas station on South Eighth Street in Fernandina Beach for regular and premium products.

According to the state, lab results found sediment in the regular premium samples that were collected.

""For clarification, the samples are being placed under stop sale for a workmanship violation regarding sediment,"" reads an email Wednesday from a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. ""The lab did not see water.""

The spokesman said the stop sale will be lifted once the facility provides product that is clear of the sediment and there will eventually be a reinspection.

Alan Rossmeissl told News4Jax last week that he went to that Flash Foods gas station on March 30 and just minutes after filling the tank, the check engine light came on.

""I stopped at a red light to come home and when I stopped, the car started to idle very roughly,"" Rossmeissl said.

The next day his concerns grew when the light didn’t turn off.

Documents show repairs cost the Rossmeissl family $411.28 out of pocket.

News4Jax went to the Flash Food gas station on Thursday and found someone from the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services was already there, talking about checking the fuel lines.

When asked about the situation, a manager told News4Jax that she was advised to say the gas station had no comment.

Circle K sent an email April 17 to the Rossmeissl and his wife, denying liability on its part and saying its investigation found:

""There was no water in our fuel tanks

No evidence of fuel contamination

No report of cross contamination

4,233.1 gallons were sold that day

No other customer complaints""

The couple said they are not satisfied with Circle K’s response.

""I just want to be reimbursed for what it cost me out of my pocket,"" Rossmeissl said.

722,"Couple arrested after locking toddlers in 'cages,' deputies say","(CNN) - Prosecutors in Modoc County, California say they will not pursue child endangerment charges against two people following an unusual discovery at their home.

Sheriff's deputies were serving a search warrant at the home of Mercadies Williams, 25, and Ramon Zendjas, 25, when they found two young children in two separate modified cribs, which they originally referred to as ""cages."" The cribs were secured to the wall like ""dog crates,"" authorities said.

But on Tuesday, the Modoc County District attorney said it was determined the cribs did not endanger the children, adding that the cribs in question can be purchased on Amazon and that the incident was blown out of proportion.

""While serving the search warrant deputies located three guns, ammunition, evidence of a butane honey oil lab, meth, and two small boys in separate modified cribs stacked on top of each other and secured to the wall like dog crates,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement.

Williams and Zendejas were initially arrested on weapons charges in addition to charges of child endangerment, drug possession and manufacturing a controlled substance, but the sheriff's office said it is dropping the child endangerment charges.

723,"'They were inseparable,' family says of Osceola teacher, boyfriend killed in crash","OSCEOLA COUNTY, Fla. - An 24-year-old Osceola County teacher and her boyfriend were killed Sunday night in a crash after leaving a family members home when another vehicle struck their vehicle, according to a crash report.

Christina Bacchus and her boyfriend Bhowani Jagmohan, 25, were attempting to turn left onto Dressage Drive when the driver of a Nissan SUV driven by 37-year-old Delric Freeman hit them.

The crash happened near the intersection of Apopka Vineland Road and Dressage Drive around 8:30 p.m., according to the Orange County crash report.

Jagmohan died at the scene and Bacchus died at the Orlando Health Hospital. Freeman was in listed in serious condition.

Kendall Persad, Jagmohan's brother-in-law was one of the last to see him and Bacchus.

He said the couple had spent the day with her family at Universal and later spent time with Jagmohan's brother hours before the crash.

He said the couple had been together for about two years and had been talking about getting married.

""They were inseparable. You could tell when they were together they loved each other,"" Persad said. ""I watched him blossom to the young man that he is today. Or was.""

Families of the couple were in Orange County Tuesday making funeral arrangements.

Bibi Musaphir is Christina's aunt. She flew in from Canada to attend the service. She had anticipated her next trip to Florida would be to attend her nieces' wedding not her funeral.

""I don't know what we're going to do tomorrow because we keep thinking when we see her then we will know it's real,"" Musaphir said.

Family gathered at Christina's parents home Tuesday.

They filled the house with pictures for Wednesday's service.

Christina's mother said she had always wanted to be a teacher and she was living out that dream at Partin Settelment Elementary school.



Osceola County Schools spokesperson Dana Schafer said letters and phone calls were made to parents of former and current students of Bacchus.

""Our hearts and thoughts are with her family and her students at this very sad time. We have counselors and our crisis team at the school for support,"" a statement from the district released said.

Musaphir said Jagmohan was waiting for the perfect time to propose.



""He gave her a promise ring. They had intentions of getting married down the line,"" Musaphir said. ""I thought I would be giving a speech at her wedding. Not like this.""

Troopers with the Florida Highway Patrol said charges are pending.

724,Central Florida couple say solar panel did not save money on bill,"A Central Florida couple say they spent thousands on a solar water heater that was supposed to reduce the amount of electricity they use and lower their power bill, but that was not the case.

""It's been pretty frustrating,"" Ken Countess said.

Ken and Vicky Countess say they were promised they would save $90 a month on their power bill.

Instead, they say they got months of frustration and cold showers.

In July 2018, the couple bought a solar water heater with a 10-year warranty from Florida Energy Water and Air, according to a purchase agreement provided to News 6.

They paid more than $11,000 for a new panel, new tank and new controller.

""We had this solar system installed in July, with a promise of 30 percent or more savings per month on our power bill,"" Ken Countess said.

But as Ken Countess tracked his monthly bills, he found there was very little savings. In fact, in four of the past seven months his bill actually increased.

""We're averaging $1 a month savings,"" he said. ""At that rate, it'll take 900 years for it to break even.""

He said the system wasn't working.

""Every single morning the water is not hot enough for us to take a shower,"" Ken Countess said.

Most doctors agree the best temperature for showering is around 110 degrees, but pictures of the temperature gauge on numerous days show the water never got hot enough until they turned their electric water heater back on.

However, technicians came out on numerous occasions, and said the system was working properly, according to the couple.

""It's been frustrating and ridiculous that we spent so much money,"" Vicky Countess said.

""I'm at a loss to understand why we're not getting anywhere close to the savings we were promised,"" Ken Countess told News 6.

Attorney Steven Kramer said companies should stand behind their sales pitch.

""The idea should be under-promise and over-deliver,"" Kramer said. ""If you set expectations you can't follow through with, then you're going to have a lot of unhappy customers.""

Ken Countess put it this way.

""If your system is not working, just take it out. Give me our money back,"" he said.

Ken Countess says he tried for months to get his money back.

When News 6 got involved, the company agreed to refund the couple $11,682.42.

Jason Spinney is the director of operations for Florida Energy Water and Air.

""We make every effort to resolve all consumer concerns,"" Spinney wrote in an email to News 6. ""We have maintained an A-plus rating with the Better Business Bureau for over a decade with no unresolved complaints. I worked personally with the homeowner to come up with an amicable resolution and at this time the complaint is resolved to the homeowner’s satisfaction.""

If you are considering a solar system, as always, make sure the company is licensed and insured and ask beforehand what the resolution policy is if you were to have a problem.

729,"Jeeps, beach a perfect match in Daytona","DAYTONA BEACH — By 11 a.m. on Saturday, a line of custom Jeeps as far as the eye could see filled the beach. Tents of all colors were perched in front of them, covering grills and beach chairs.

Beachgoers took in the sunshine, enjoying the 77-degree weather.

People weren't there just to enjoy the sun, though. Hundreds of Jeeps cruised along the world's most famous beach, as owners showed off their custom rides and took in the ocean view.

The News-Journal went out Saturday to capture the sights and sounds of the final weekend of Jeep Beach, a Jeep-only charity event held each April in Daytona Beach to raise money for local and national charities.

Here are some of the people who enjoyed their Jeep — at the beach.

1989 ERAU graduate returns for Jeep Beach

Matt Barrett hasn't been back to Daytona Beach since he graduated from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 1989 with a degree in aeronautical studies management.

""It's cool because she got to take photos of me places where I used to live,"" Barrett said of his girlfriend, Suzanne Jolly.

The two decided to make the trek back to Barrett's old stomping grounds to be a part of their first Jeep Beach experience.

""We're ready to book next year's already,"" Jolly said. ""Everything is very well run and they have a good variety of things to do.""

The two currently live in Atlanta, and on the weekends take Jolly's white 2015 Rubicon Jeep with rugged grey decals — named ""Ruby"" — up to the mountains.

""We have a dog who loves the Jeep,"" Jolly said. ""It's all about loading up and letting the day unravel.""

Jolly said her favorite part about owning her Jeep is that it can ""get in and out of anywhere you want it to go.""

Jeep hammock fun

What separates the Pfleider's Jeep from all the others surrounding it is they get to swing on their very own Jeep hammocks.

""We saw it at a trade show and had to have it,"" Ashley Pfleider said over the boom of their speaker's bass. ""We also have 12 speakers just in the back of our jeep.""

This is the third year she and her husband Matthew have come to Jeep Beach from Lakeland. Each year they come with a group of 10 friends.

""It's an adult trip without the kids,"" Ashley said. ""We come up here for four days.""

She said the best part of the event is seeing all the different versions of Jeeps.

""Not one Jeep is the same,"" she said. ""The first year we came we didn't have a Jeep. Jeep Beach convinced us to buy a Jeep.""

The couple attend other Jeep-related events across the state and said they bring the kids to those events.

""With a Jeep, you can go for freedom by taking the doors off,"" Ashley said. ""But you can put the doors on and it's a family car. It's like a transformer.""

GRRRR

When you walk up to Jack Barnes' bright orange Jeep, he'll press a small button on his key chain and the Jeep will let out a deep tiger's growl.

""I put a remote-controlled growler on it,"" he said with a little laugh. ""There are also tiger eyes on the brake lights.""

Barnes, who lives in Leesburg, bought his 2002 Jeep last year. It was plain white.

""I rebuilt it myself,"" he said of his tiger-themed Jeep. ""I just thought it was cool because nobody else had it.""

This is Barnes' first Jeep. He always had his eye on them but never pulled the trigger.

""I made it how I want it,"" he said. ""It's a never-ending process.""

As if the tiger-themed Jeep, with its stripes and custom rims, wasn't enough, Barnes wore matching swim trunks and a bright orange ""Daytona Beach, Florida"" T-shirt.

""I also have shoes,"" he said. ""This is my second year coming out to this event. I just like to see as many Jeeps as possible.""

Firefighters take a break at Jeep Beach

For John Pinkhan, Jeep Beach is a way for him and his co-workers to take a break from life's daily stresses and kick back.

""The three of us work together at the Marion County Fire Rescue,"" Pinkhan said, pointing to two men making their way down to the water. ""These two guys are single. We're here for the night so who knows what we'll get into.""

This is Pinkhan's second year at Jeep Beach with his wife Christine. This year they brought her 2017 Jeep he upgraded with a new stereo, lift kit and bigger tires.

""She likes taking it out,"" he said. ""We like looking at the other Jeeps. It's a big community and a good excuse to hang out.""

A family vacation

This is the first year the Newberrys of Mims have come to Jeep Beach.

""We plan on hanging out at the beach for a while and then head out to the Speedway,"" said Earl Newberry. ""It's pretty awesome watching the Jeeps and seeing everything everyone has.""

Earl and his wife Amanda brought their daughter Jade and her friend Mikayla Maurer, both 14.

""It's fun getting to see all the different designs on the beach,"" said Mikayla.

Amanda Newberry got her 2014 Jeep about a year ago. She's never had one before and was skeptical at first.

""I am shocked at how much I love the Jeep,"" she said. ""In two years, my daughter is getting it and I definitely want another one.""

The couple already have the design in mind. A four-door Rubicon, lifted and painted mojito green.

""He wants everything but the kitchen sink,"" Amanda said.

732,Celebs who've opened up about their fertility struggles,"Following Jenna Bush Hagar’s announcement on “TODAY” earlier this week, as she told fans that she and her husband are expecting their third child, meteorologist Dylan Dreyer later in the show bravely revealed her own personal news: an emotional battle with infertility.

In honor of National Infertility Awareness Week, Dreyer spoke about a recent miscarriage and her infertility struggle, and said she hopes to “shed the stigma” by sharing her truth.

Due to her emergency C-section with her first-born, Dreyer is unable to conceive, and is now exploring alternative methods. In fact, about 10 percent of women experience difficulty getting or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

We thought we'd shine a light on all the celebrities who've spoken about their own struggles or unique situations.

1.) Elizabeth Banks

Kicking off our list is Banks, who referenced her ""broken belly"" in a blog entry back in 2011. The post, in which Banks introduces her newborn son, Felix, reads, in part: ""After years of trying to get pregnant, exploring the range of fertility treatments, all unsuccessful, our journey led us to gestational surrogacy: we make a 'baby cake' and bake it in another woman's 'oven.'""

Really, it only feels appropriate that Banks used some humor in her analogy. Banks and her husband went on to have a second son, also through surrogacy, about a year after Felix's arrival.

2.) Tyra Banks

The “America’s Next Top Model” host welcomed a son in January 2016 who was born through gestational surrogacy. But Banks did a lot of in vitro fertilization leading up to that. She said once in an interview, “On Cycle 22's final runway, at the [Walt] Disney Concert Hall, I had to go into a back closet and give myself my final shot, and that was the seventh round of IVF.”

3.) Angela Bassett

Getty Images

Bassett, of “American Horror Story” fame, alongside her husband, Courtney B. Vance, has spoken publicly several times about how long it took to conceive the couple’s twins. Bassett told Oprah the pair eventually opted to use a surrogate, after enduring seven years of failed fertility treatments. Bassett has also spoken to Jet magazine about the couple's struggles.

4.) Beyonce

Beyonce proved she was one of us after all, when she shared in her 2013 HBO documentary, “Beyoncé: Life Is but a Dream,” that she suffered a miscarriage before Blue Ivy was born, and then reportedly got ""frustrated"" after unsuccessful IVF treatments. Queen Bey and husband Jay-Z were even looking into surrogates and adoption, according to published reports, before the couple went on to have two healthy twins, Rumi and Sir, carried by Beyonce herself.

5.) Jordana Brewster

The “Fast and the Furious” actress spoke to Cosmopolitan magazine in October 2014 about motherhood and the experience of using a surrogate. She said, in part, ""I couldn't carry a baby. At first, I was scared. I had no idea what [surrogacy] entailed. Then I started researching agencies. ... [Surrogacy] taught me a lot to have to rely on someone else to carry my baby for me, because I'm such a private and self-sufficient person. It's the most intimate leap of faith and trust you can take.""

6.) Mariah Carey

When Carey got together with her (now-ex) husband Nick Cannon, Carey was nearly 40. But the two wanted to have a baby together, so they tried naturally at first -- and suffered a miscarriage in 2008. After some continued struggles, the pair decided to go through IVF. They successfully went on to have a set of healthy twins, perhaps thanks to the advice from Carey’s friend, Celine Dion, who recommended acupuncture to reduce Carey's stress levels. It’s been said that acupuncture might improve your chances of pregnancy, in some cases. Carey talked about the practice to Access Hollywood in 2010.

7.) Courteney Cox

“I had a bunch of miscarriages,” the “Friends” star reportedly said in her Facebook Watch web series, “9 Months with Courteney Cox,” which follows 10 couples with different pregnancy experiences. “But I was lucky enough to have my little girl, Coco, who I had through IVF.”

“If I can share any light or give wisdom to somebody, or hope, of course, I would share anything I can,” Cox told Entertainment Tonight. “I think that’s important.”

8.) Celine Dion

As mentioned above, it was Dion who recommended acupuncture to Carey for help getting and staying pregnant. Dion and her (now late) husband René Angélil started trying for kids when Dion was in her 30s, but they didn't have any luck. Years later and after seven IVF cycles, the couple finally had their sons, first, René-Charles, and then twins Nelson and Eddy.

Regarding those seven IVF cycles, Dion once said in an interview, ""I thought as long as my health permitted me and unless my doctor thought physically I couldn’t do it, then I would go on with the IVF until someone told me to stop.”

Dunham has been very open about her decade-long struggle with endometriosis pain -- and she’s even posted about her decision to undergo a hysterectomy at the age of 31. There’s still a chance Dunham could be a mother someday, considering the available options like egg freezing and surrogacy, and she told Vogue that those possibilities, coupled with the idea of adoption, (are) a “thrilling truth I’ll pursue with all my might.”

Fallon, host of “The Tonight Show” said on “TODAY” that he and his wife, Nancy Juvonen, endured a five-year infertility struggle before having their daughter, Winnie, via a surrogate. ""We've tried a bunch of things,"" he told host Savannah Guthrie. ""Anyone who's tried will know -- it's just awful.""

“Speaking of childbirth, I had my children through surrogacy,"" the former star of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills has said, according to a blog. ""If you can’t get pregnant for whatever reason, it’s great to know that there are options available for people that want to have a family. I wish I could have had that experience. I’m just so grateful I had a wonderful surrogate who carried our two children. I have two amazing angels in my life that I love so much. They are such a gift and a blessing from God.”

Grammer was married to Kelsey Grammer from 1997 to 2011. Their kids, Mason and Jude, are now teenagers.

The gold medal-winning former gymnast shared that she felt guilty after miscarrying her first baby.

""I felt sad,"" Johnson said. ""And I remember telling Andrew (East), 'I'm sorry I lost your baby.' I felt like it was something that I did. I didn't take care of the baby well enough. I was stressed out too much. Or I didn't take the right prenatal vitamins. There are all these different guilts and thoughts and negative feelings … like, I failed my baby. … I felt like I was (uninhabitable). Like, no baby's going to live inside this belly.""

The good news is, just more than a year later, the two are expecting!

13.) Khloe Kardashian

After years of wanting a baby -- which was pretty well-documented on reality TV during Kardashian’s marriage to then-NBA star Lamar Odom -- she finally got one: her daughter, True, was born in April 2018. Odom was out of the picture by then, and Cleveland Cavaliers forward Tristan Thompson is True’s father, but that’s neither here nor there.

Kardashian had explored the possibilities of parenthood with Odom, and at the time, the situation on TV seemed to be chalked up to unexplained infertility. When Kardashian was questioned about this years later, she clarified: “I did all my treatments, but then when we did further testing, we realized I was NOT the one with the issue. ... It takes two to have a baby.”

14.) Nicole Kidman

Kidman and husband Keith Urban surprised fans in 2010 when they announced the birth of their daughter, Faith, born through a gestational carrier. Kidman has since spoken openly about her ups and downs with fertility, according to ABC News.

15.) Hoda Kotb

The “TODAY” host had always wanted to be a mom, but a battle with breast cancer a decade ago left her unable to conceive, according to Southern Living. ""Sometimes in your life, things just don't work out for whatever reason, so you say, 'Well, I wasn't meant to have that.' But it was really hard to come to terms with it."" Fast-forward to today, Kotb has two adopted daughters: Hope Catherine and Haley Joy.

(For what it’s worth, perhaps this is proof that it’s never too late! Kotb became a new mother at the age of 52!)

16.) Jana Kramer

The country music star spoke to People magazine about getting pregnant naturally with both of her children, after two failed IVF cycles. What are the odds?

17.) Joan Lunden

The former “Good Morning America” host has joked that she’s the “poster child” for infertility. Having children through a surrogate was still a bit of a novelty when Lunden did it in 2003 and again in 2005.

“Families these days are made in many different ways,” she once said to Newsmax Health. “It’s really a wonderful amazing thing that there are women in this world who are so selfless that they will carry a child for another couple, that will help them make a family.”

Lunden even did a big spread with People magazine back in 2003, detailing her circumstances.

18.) Maria Menounos

Menounos has been very public about her journey, chatting about it on her satellite radio show, posting about it on social media -- heck, she’s even Snapchatted her egg-retrieval process.

Read the interview she did with Health magazine in June 2016. At last check, she and her husband, longtime love Keven Undergaro, were considering using a surrogate.

19.) Michelle Obama

The former first lady shared in her memoir that she and her husband, former President Barack Obama, conceived their daughters, Sasha and Malia, via IVF. Michelle also said in the book that she felt very alone after suffering a miscarriage, about 20 years ago.

20.) Sarah Jessica Parker

Parker suffered from secondary infertility, which is when you struggle to conceive after already giving birth to a child. When she was filming the movie “Did You Hear About the Morgans?”, which came out in 2009, she and her husband, Matthew Broderick, shared with the world that they were expecting twins through surrogacy. Elle magazine credits the announcement with sparking a national conversation about surrogacy: the economics and the reasoning behind it.

""I knew there would be lots of opinions about, ‘Well, why didn't you adopt? Why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that?’ and the truth of the matter is, it wasn't one or the other for us,” Parker said.

She went on to tell the magazine that she and Broderick had explored all their options. This just so happened to come first.

21.) Giuliana Rancic

Rancic’s story could fill a book -- but we’ll let the “E!” host do the talking: She penned a really poignant piece called “#LetsTalkFertility” in April 2018, in which she discusses “hundreds of shots, multiple rounds of IVF, miscarriage and heartbreak.”

She writes, “No one ever told me, ‘Oh, by the way, your eggs change when you reach a certain age.’ I definitely had misconceptions about my fertility. … Unfortunately, fertility is a topic that people don’t talk about – it makes them uncomfortable. There is still stigma and silence that is attached to fertility issues that is painful to the core. But the truth is, 1 in 8 couples in the U.S. are impacted by infertility, so it’s time we shift the cultural narrative by talking about it. Now more than ever, this feels like the right time to normalize the conversation around fertility.”

22.) Elisabeth Rohm

Rohm, perhaps best known for her role as Serena Southerlyn on “Law & Order,” wanted to be the one who told her story, as well. So she wrote a book called, “Baby Steps: Having the Child I Always Wanted (Just Not As I Expected).”

Here’s what she said on the topic of infertility to New York Metro Parents: “I discovered at 34 that I had fertility issues and that if I wanted to have a child I needed to do IVF pretty aggressively, which came as a shock to me. We kept it to ourselves. We only shared it with our very closest family members. But after talking to a girlfriend who was on her third miscarriage and who felt like she needed to get some help, I decided to tell her I had done IVF. There was this instant feeling of connection in telling the truth about it and this relief in being able to help her find the right doctor. We need to move the ball down the field of talking about infertility openly and not being ashamed of it, if we’re experiencing it.” Hats off, Elisabeth!

23.) Brooke Shields

After a miscarriage and undergoing several rounds of IVF to no avail, Shields tried one final round of IVF at the age of 36, according to Fertility Today. And it worked -- Shields got pregnant in 2002 and gave birth to her daughter, Rowan, in 2003. She wrote about the experience in her memoir, according to reports.

24.) Amy Smart

Last year, Smart took to her Instagram page to share a sweet photo of her and her daughter -- and mentioned using a surrogate to carry the baby after years of her own infertility struggles. The post is flooded with comments from well-wishers, including users saying things like, “Thank you for being open about your fertility struggles, @smarthouse26. Your honesty helps destigmatize it and helps anyone going through it feel more normal and OK. Bless you and your perfect daughter.”

25.) Trista Sutter

The “Bachelorette” alum called her two-year infertility struggle “definitely a dark time in my life,” in an article in US Weekly. She and her husband, Ryan Sutter, went on to have two children, but she detailed her struggles and the insecurities she felt while promoting her book in 2015.

26.) Chrissy Teigen

These days, Teigen and husband John Legend have their hands full, chasing after two kids. But it wasn't always like this.

""I will say, honestly, John and I are having trouble,"" Teigen confessed in 2015, adding that they'd seen fertility doctors. ""We would have kids five, six years ago if it'd happened. But my gosh, it's been a process! ... So, any time somebody asks me if I'm going to have kids, I'm like, 'One day, you're going to ask that to the wrong girl who's really struggling, and it's going to be really hurtful to them. And I hate that. So, I hate it. Stop asking me!'"" Tyra Banks, mentioned up top, got emotional about her own journey during the ""FABLife"" discussion, as well.

27.) Gabrielle Union

""If you happen to have issues with fertility as you've gotten older and you happen to have a career, all is not lost,"" said Union, the wife of Dwayne Wade, during a visit to ""TODAY.""

""There is so much hope, there are so many options.""

In an interview with Redbook, she said, ""So far, it has not happened for us. A lot of my friends deal with [struggles to have a baby]. There's a certain amount of shame that is placed on women who have perhaps chosen a career over starting a family younger."" She went on to say that it's important not to feel that shame.

""I don’t have children. I’m not going to have kids,"" the actress told Maria Menounos on her SiriusXM radio show. ""I went through early menopause.""

29.) Kim Kardashian West

When you’re Kardashian West, not a lot in your life is able to slide under the radar. She’s made headlines many times in recent years for her fertility. Kardashian West carried her first two children, then used a surrogate for her third baby, Chicago, and the one she and husband Kanye West are currently expecting.

Kardashian West developed placenta accreta, a condition in which the placenta doesn't detach from the wall of the womb properly, which is why she says she’s now using a carrier.

She revealed in “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” that the damage left her with a hole in her uterus that required surgery if she was to conceive again. Kardashian West underwent the surgery, but it was unsuccessful. Marie Claire reports that she said, “I can’t carry any more kids. It’s the worst. It’s not going to be happy for me. I had a full break down. I give up.”

The bubbly “Hairspray” star beat cervical cancer at the age of 27, but lost her cervix and uterus. With that, she lost the possibility of getting pregnant herself, but fortunately enough, found a surrogate she bonded with and trusted.

""The second I met her, I knew, ‘This was it. This was the woman.' Exactly six months later, we were pregnant."" Watch Winokur as she tells her story in this YouTube video from Redbook magazine.

31.) Mark Zuckerberg

Getty Images

The Facebook founder and his wife, Priscilla Chan, cut right to the chase when announcing their pregnancy on -- well, what other platform would you expect? -- Facebook (of course!)

""Priscilla and I have some exciting news: we're expecting a baby girl! ... We want to share one experience to start. We've been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way.

""You feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a child. You start imagining who they'll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they're gone. It's a lonely experience. Most people don't discuss miscarriages because you worry your problems will distance you or reflect upon you -- as if you're defective or did something to cause this. So you struggle on your own. In today's open and connected world, discussing these issues doesn't distance us; it brings us together. It creates understanding and tolerance, and it gives us hope.""

733,Cotterell: Armed teachers will have a truly awesome responsibility,"Bill Cotterell is a former reporter with the Tallahassee Democrat and writes a regular column for USA Today Florida Network (Photo: Tallahassee Democrat)

No matter how you feel about arming teachers, you can’t read the legislation implementing recommendations of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission without an overwhelming sense of sadness.

So this is what we’ve come to. Guns in the public schools. The ultimate extreme step to be ready for the unspeakable horror, the ghastly possibility no one wants to think about – but which became so real on Feb. 14, 2018.

Florida legislators often have to try logical, sensible, smart solutions for behavior that is illogical, senseless and stupid. For 30 years, they’ve been trying, with limited success, to deter drunk driving and domestic violence with prevention, education and punishment.

Every little bit helps, and they can’t stop trying, but you can’t prevent crazy behavior with sane, orderly solutions. Not all of it, anyway.

The trouble with guns, though, is that you’ve got to get it right every time. One mistake – and no matter how much training and preparation is required, humans will make mistakes – and somebody winds up dead or maimed for life.

Sometimes I think the movies and TV have given us a warped idea of our own competency.

You know what I’d do if one of those shootings started at the mall, or a movie theater or a school when I was there? I’d get my gun and drop that guy like a bad habit, that’s what I’d do. Yeah, right. It’s easy to imagine ourselves like Clint Eastwood in “Dirty Harry” or Charles Bronson in “Death Wish,” springing into bold, heroic action in an emergency.

Or maybe we’d be like the smiling, confident Sheriff Andy Taylor in Mayberry, calmly defusing a bad situation with a smile and a firm command. It’s more likely Deputy Barney Fife, though, fumbling in his shirt pocket for that lone bullet and dropping his revolver a couple times.

Yet, at the same time, could the murderous rampage in Broward County last year – or at Columbine, Sandy Hook or that movie theater in Aurora, Colo. – have been any worse if (as the NRA puts it) “a good guy with a gun” had been present? Maybe. As with Florida’s 2005 “Stand Your Ground” law, there’s the danger of innocent bystanders getting hit by that good guy.

And it’s probably not going to stop the kind of evil, insane person who would want to kill people. If knowledge that a teacher is armed deters one attack, that’s great, but it’s also likely that a potential gunman would find out which teachers are the designated “guardians” and shoot them first, or avoid that part of the building.

But knowing nobody in there can shoot back certainly doesn’t deter a heavily armed lunatic.

The teacher unions and a large number of students, including some from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, urged legislators not to authorize the arming of teachers. The Senate passed the bill (which does a whole lot more than that) by a vote of 22-17, with only one Republican joining the Democrats in voting against it.

Passage in the House during the final days of the 2019 legislative session is a virtual certainty. Gov. Ron DeSantis is on board. This is going to happen.

But that doesn’t mean every teacher will be carrying a side arm. Only volunteers in counties that opt into the year-old guardian program, who go through thorough training with their county sheriffs’ offices, will be armed.

Then we can only hope they get it right, every time.

So what do you think will happen first: A teacher hears a rumor of a gunman on campus and shoots some kid carrying a trombone case to band class, because it sure looked like a gun for a second or two? Or a real killer shows up with an AR-15, and that same teacher prevents another horror story?

734,Flesh-eating bacteria nearly kills Pinellas County man,"- Fisherman Mike Walton is home from the hospital, nursing a nasty wound after almost losing his life to a flesh-eating bacteria.

It started with a minor accident a couple of weeks ago, when he was fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, near Ozona, Florida.

“I had hooked my hand in the afternoon not thinking anything of it,” Walton said. “It was amazing how fast it was spreading.”

Small blisters on his hands later turned black. After a couple of days, he knew the antibiotics a doctor gave him weren’t working, so he drove himself to the emergency room in the middle of the night.

“They admitted me right off the spot and got me into surgery an hour or half or so,” he said.

Continue reading below

Walton says doctors told him he had a very rare flesh-eating bacteria. Right now, they are working to determine what strain.

“When I woke up and [saw] my hand still attached, I was happy,” he said.

However, this was much more serious than just his hand, or arm.

“They said in a few hours this would have gone up my arm into my chest and I wouldn’t have been here. There was no saving me,” Walton said.

He’s now back home after three surgeries and a week in the hospital.

Walton is a construction worker, now out of work. That’s where his fishing buddies at the Ozona Fish Camp come in.

Eric Mclendon says they are raising money online and holding tournaments to benefit their friend.

“Everybody has been contributing, everybody has been pitching in, everybody has been wanting to help him. I mean, he helps everyone! That’s just the kind of person he is,” Mclendon told FOX 13 Monday.

Mike says he’s lucky to have such great friends and even luckier to be alive.

“I’m just glad to be here,” Walton said. “I can’t wait to go back fishing not going to lie about that!”",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/flesh-eating-bacteria-nearly-kills-pinellas-man,2019-04-25T22:33:08Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609

736,House take aims at ballot petition process,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - With Republicans warning of a proliferation of constitutional amendments, the Florida House on Thursday passed a measure that would make it harder for citizens’ initiatives to get on the ballot.

The bill (HB 7111) drew heavy debate, with Democrats contending that groups turn to amending the Constitution because the Legislature often ignores the wishes of voters on issues. For example, Rep. Margaret Good, D-Sarasota, pointed to ballot drives in recent years that broadly legalized medical marijuana and restored felons’ voting rights.

“A lot of people are not getting the representation that they deserve,” Good said. “That means that they have to do things like put constitutional amendments on the ballot to make sure that we are protecting our citizens.”

But bill supporters said the Constitution has become bloated with issues that don’t belong in the foundation of state government. The bill largely focuses on new requirements for the petition-gathering process, which plays a crucial role in placing citizens’ initiatives on the ballot.

“Somebody with a couple of million dollars can come in from out of state, gather up these signatures, put it on the ballot and then send out some mailers,” Rep. Mike Beltran, R-Lithia, said. “There is no bicameralism, where it goes through the House, it goes through the Senate and it’s presented to the governor.”

The bill, which was approved in a 71-41 party-line vote, comes after voters in November approved 11 constitutional amendments on issues ranging from restoring felons’ voting rights to banning greyhound racing. Two of the measures were placed on the ballot through petition drives, while the rest were put before voters by the Legislature or the state Constitution Revision Commission.

A series of high-profile ballot initiatives also have been proposed for the 2020 ballot, including proposals to raise the minimum wage, expand Medicaid eligibility, ban assault-style weapons and deregulate the electric utility system -- issues widely opposed by Republican leaders.

To get on the ballot, initiative backers will have to submit 766,200 valid petition signatures to the state and get approval from the Florida Supreme Court for the proposed ballot wording. If measures go before voters in November 2020, they will need to receive approval from at least 60 percent of voters to pass.

The House bill, sponsored by Rep. James Grant, R-Tampa, would make a series of changes in laws dealing with initiatives, such as making it illegal to pay petition gatherers based on the number of petitions they collect. Also, for example, it would require submission of information about petition gatherers, including their permanent and temporary addresses, and would require the gatherers to sign sworn statements that they will follow state laws and rules.

While petition signatures already collected for the 2020 initiatives would not be affected, the bill would take effect immediately if it is also passed by the Senate and signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis. A Senate version of the bill (SB 7096) cleared one subcommittee and is in the Appropriations Committee.

During the debate Thursday, Rep. Sam Killebrew, R-Winter Haven, recounted how he talked with a petition-gatherer who was from New Mexico and traveled across the country to work on such ballot drives.

“Don’t think that everybody who is out there getting these petitions is passionate about the issue,” Killebrew said.

But Democrats argued that the public needs to be able to use the initiative process to amend the Constitution.

“Very often, our citizens feel that the legislative process has not gotten them to the place they want to be,” said Rep. Richard Stark, D-Weston. “So, they file petitions to go on the ballot to change the law that we haven’t been able to do.”

738,Former city manager Higginbothom dies,"Former Gainesville City Manager William Dillard “W.D.” Higginbotham Jr. died last week at age 77.

Not everyone who knew W.D. Higginbotham knew what his initials stood for, though he was quite popular among the people in cities he served.

In fact, most news articles and TV reports that mentioned him over his 35-year career — including a five-year stint as Gainesville's city manager — rarely bothered to elaborate on his name. His wife, Dona Higginbotham, asserts no one knew it.

But to those who did know the man with a signature mustache that would make Tom Selleck jealous say he was an utmost professional who cared deeply for his friends and family.

William Dillard “W.D.” Higginbotham Jr. died last week at age 77 from a lung infection, a complication after being diagnosed with lung cancer. He had five children and eight grandkids.

“He was everybody’s grandpa and everybody’s friend,” his wife said.

Born in New Orleans in 1941 to Hazel and William Higginbotham, W.D. was one of five kids. His mother gave him the nickname to not confuse him with his father. He quickly became the man of the house at age 15 after the death of his father, a U.S. merchant marine. Hustling at restaurants and delivering newspapers, he helped his mother pay the bills.

“He was never too proud to do anything,” his wife said.

He graduated from Tulane University in 1968 with a degree in accounting and later earned an economic development degree from the University of South Florida.

A quick glance at his resumé proves finding work came easy.

Higginbotham served in various roles for at least seven cities around the state. He was assistant finance director for Rosewood City in California and assistant city manager in Bakersfield, California, before landing in Gainesville.

He held the title of Gainesville city manager from September 1984 through April 1989.

Former Gainesville Fire Rescue Chief Don Harkins, who worked for the city throughout the former manager’s tenure, said that W.D. Higginbotham was pro-public safety, largely due to his background in California and seeing wildfires and earthquakes. Once he came to Gainesville, he added, it was obvious that first responders and their departments were a priority.

“He had a soft spot for public safety,” said Harkins, who now works as an assistant fire chief for Seminole County. “I think the years that W.D. was there, the fire and police departments flourished.”

When not visiting with family or traveling, he enjoyed going to football games. As a UF football season ticket holder, even after leaving Gainesville, his wife said he enjoyed being anywhere near the university. Most of the time, he could be found in a Florida Gators T-shirt, as Gator gear made up a bulk of his wardrobe, his wife said.

He liked soul food, barbecue and Cajun foods. One of his newer favorite Gainesville restaurants was Sweetberries Eatery and Frozen Custard, located at 505 NW 13th St., she said.

“He just so loved Gainesville,” his wife said. “We both do.”

Former City Commissioner Todd Chase first met Higginbotham while the late manager worked as an employment recruiter. Chase said he always knew him as someone highly regarded around the state who made lasting impacts in cities he served.

“He once told me his time in Gainesville was one of the most meaningful times of his career,” Chase said.

After leaving Gainesville, Higginbotham was named director of economic development for the North Central Florida Regional Planning Council. During his tenure there, he met and married his wife Dona.

He served as manager for Surfside, Melbourne Beach and Madeira Beach and was president of the Treasure Island Chamber of Commerce. He was a financial adviser for the International City/County Management Association and Department of Defense during 2005 in Baghdad, Iraq. Most recently he served as senior vice president for the Mercer Group, an executive search firm for government jobs located in Daytona Beach where he lived out his remaining years.

“It was like everywhere we went, someone always knew him,” his wife said.

Dona Higginbotham said her husband would always be retiring, but that it never lasted more than a few months.

Last summer, those job opportunities took a backseat when the former city manager was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began receiving daily treatments at UF Health Shands Hospital soon after.

Higginbotham was a smoker up into his 40s, his wife said, but had quit more than 30 years ago. There was no sign of cancer throughout the years, she added.

“It was quite a blow,” she said.

For nearly a year, the couple felt optimistic that he'd beaten the disease.

The couple had returned from one of their dream vacations in Europe last month, where they visited Paris, London and Rome, where he climbed the Spanish Steps three times in a single afternoon, she said. But it wasn’t until after the trip that they found he had a deadly infection in his lungs.

“He was never sick a day in his life,” she said. “He had the energy of a 35-year-old.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190425/former-city-manager-higginbothom-dies?rssfeed=true,2019-04-25T17:53:30Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
739,Study: Marijuana smokers are less likely to be obese than non-smokers,"- It's been said that smoking marijuana gives people 'the munchies' so naturally you would think that most pot smokers could be susceptible to putting on a little weight. Well, not according to a new study that says those who smoke marijuana are less likely to be obese than non-smokers.

According to a paper published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, 33,000 people participated and all of them gained weight during the three-year study. Those who smoked weed, however, added the fewest pounds.

""We found that users, even those who just started, were more likely to be at a normal, healthier weight and stay at that weight,"" study co-author Dr. Omayma Alshaarawy, assistant professor of family medicine at Michigan State University, said in a statement. ""Only 15 percent of persistent users were considered obese compared to 20 percent of non-users.""

Researchers compared body mass index for all of the participants who took part in the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions study to come to their conclusion.

The team behind the study couldn't come up with a reason why smoking pot led to a lower BMI. A couple of theories are:

Cannabis creates changes physically in your cells that impact weight gain

People who smoke may watch their weight more knowing they are prone to overeating while high

Now if you're thinking that smoking weed could be a great way to maintain your weight, think again.

""There's too many health concerns around cannabis that far outweigh the potential positive, yet modest, effects it has on weight gain,"" Alshaarawy said. ""People shouldn't consider it as a way to maintain or even lose weight.""",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/mobile-app-news-feed/study-marijuana-smokers-are-less-likely-to-be-obese-than-non-smokers,2019-04-25T17:44:48Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

744,Brush fire burns at nature preserve in Pompano Beach,"POMPANO BEACH, Fla. - Firefighters were battling a 3-acre brush fire Wednesday at the Highland Scrub Nature Preserve in Pompano Beach.

The fire started around noon in the 4000 block of North Dixie Highway. The view from Sky 10 showed large plumes of smoke traveling over the neighboring train tracks.

Crews from Broward Fire Rescue, the Florida Forest Service and Pompano Beach Fire Rescue were on the scene.

""We haven’t gotten rain for a couple days so its dry. I guess it started over there and worked it way down here,"" said Daniel Pouliot who lives in the area.

Battalion Chief Michael Kane, a spokesman for Broward Fire Rescue, said firefighters are allowing the fire to burn in a controlled state. Kane said he expects the blaze to be extinguished by Wednesday evening.

Firefighters were dousing the flames with a water hose from a truck.

It wasn't immediately known what started the fire.

745,Blue Wahoos’ Smeltzer throws gem just a week after recovering from getting hit on head,"CLOSE A Silver Airways Saab 340b Turboprop now pays homage to the Pensacola Blue Wahoos. Bill Vilona, Special to the News Journal

The scariest moment in pitcher Devin Smeltzer’s baseball career never fazed him.

He took a line drive off the back of his neck last Wednesday in Biloxi, causing a stadium to fall into a hush, both teams standing stunned and Pensacola Blue Wahoos manager Ramon Borrego fearing the worst.

“It was so scary,” he said. “I walked so slowly to the mound… I was praying nothing happened.”

What happened was Smeltzer returning to the mound Tuesday night, delivering another outstanding performance with nine strikeouts, no walks through seven innings of a hard-luck, 1-0 loss against the Mobile BayBears. A crowd of 4,288 watched a pitching and fielding showcase among both teams.

Most of all, they saw Smeltzer’s fortitude shining through. The lefty has allowed just two earned runs in four starts and 25 innings pitched. His 0.72 earned run average is the lowest in the Southern League among any pitcher with at least four starts.

“He is a warrior,” said Borrego, whose team completed a five-game homestand Wednesday night against the BayBears. “To get through that moment (last week) and come back and give you that kind of game…. that was impressive.”

Smeltzer wasn’t having any flashbacks. Instead, he’s re-watched the video of having a 96-mph baseball ricochet off the back of his head more than 1,000 times.

Smeltzer instantly fell to the ground as teammates gathered. He was removed from the game, taken to a nearby hospital, where tests, fortunately, revealed no concussion or serious trauma to his head.

“I have had a couple (line drives) go off the body, but nothing off the head,” Smeltzer said.

The guy who beat cancer at 9-years-old isn’t going to let getting struck by a baseball affect him.

“Everything that’s happened, it’s going to take a lot more than that,” he said. “I posted (video) of it on my Instagram. I wanted to see where it got me. That’s just how I am. I want to keep things like.

“You can’t get too mental with it. You have to take it for what it is. You can’t pitch scared, because that’s when the ball finds you… and the ball knows.”

The game’s only run Tuesday night occurred in the third inning. With two out, Connor Justus singled, stole second and scored on Brandon Marsh’s single. Marsh was then thrown out on a perfect throw-and-tag from centerfielder Tanner English to second baseman Brian Schales.

The Blue Wahoos (13-6) left the bases loaded in the bottom of the third, which proved decisive. Mobile starter Jeremy Beasley threw five scoreless innings, allowing only two hits with five strikeouts. The BayBears (7-11) had their bullpen thwart a couple of other chances in the later innings.

“It was good to be back out there competing without any problems,” Smeltzer said. “Their starter did a great job and gave me a run for my money. The defense had some huge plays behind me and helped me out big time.

“I know I’m going to go out and give everything I can to pick those guys up and I know when I go out and let up (10) they’re going to pick me up.”

Five of the Blue Wahoos' six losses this season have been by one run in low-scoring games. In the ninth, the Blue Wahoos Caleb Hamilton drew a one-out walk against reliever Dario Beltre, who then struck out English and Taylor Grzelakowski with breaking pitches to end the game.

“I want to give credit to their pitching staff,” Borrego said. “We had a couple chances to do some damage and didn’t do it. Unfortunately, the offense was really flat. But that’s baseball. Somebody has to win and they pitched well.”

In a poignant moment afterward, Grzelakowski sat in the dugout for a long time before exiting the clubhouse. It was another example of how much winning games matters to this team.

“This team wants to win more than a lot of teams I have played with,” Smeltzer. “This group of guys gives everything they’ve got every night. It doesn’t matter who is up there. You can put a big league club out there and we’re going to compete like it’s game seven (playoffs).”

The Blue Wahoos left after Wednesday’s game to travel to Jackson, Tenn., where they play a five-game road series against the Jackson Generals, the Seattle Mariners’ Double-A affiliate, who entered Wednesday tied for the North Division lead with the Tennessee Smokies.

The Blue Wahoos next home series begins May 1 against the Biloxi Shuckers.

746,"Family, coaches remember beginnings for Taylor, Gardner-Johnson, Dean","Former Cocoa High football coach John Wilkinson remembered first meeting each of his former Tigers likely to be selected this weekend in the NFL Draft in Nashville, but the first time he saw Jawaan Taylor stood out.

Now the head coach at New Smyrna Beach, Wilkinson recalled seeing Taylor for the first time in the cafeteria at Kennedy Middle School.

""I guess he was in eighth grade,"" Wilkinson said. ""I remember being in the lunch room and seeing him come in, and he was so big. He had to be 300 pounds and 6-2 or 6-3.""

Thursday night, Wilkinson will be at Taylor's table in downtown Nashville when the NFL Draft begins at 8 p.m. Taylor, the former Florida Gators and Cocoa Tigers offensive tackle, measured at 6-foot-5 and 312 pounds at the recent NFL Combine.

He is now the consensus No. 1 offensive tackle available according to draft analysts, and he was one of a couple dozen college players from around the country invited to be on site as selections are announced.

See the complete list: Where were 25 Brevard HS grads taken in the NFL Draft?

Draft rankings: Mock drafts and 2019 Brevard County products

Experts have predicted Taylor will go in the top 10, with the consensus expecting the Jacksonville Jaguars to take him at the seventh pick of the first round. Former Astronaut High and UF player Wilber Marshall, drafted 11th overall by the Chicago Bears in 1984, is the highest draft pick among Brevard high school products to this point.

The next two locals expected to come off the draft board play the same position as the area's last NFL pick, former Holy Trinity and Gators defensive back Marcus Maye, taken in the second round by the Jets in 2017, 39th overall.

Gators safety Chauncey Gardner-Johnson, who also played for Wilkinson at Cocoa and announced after last season he would enter the draft following his junior year of college, appears likely to be taken anywhere from the late first round to the third. Many experts list him as a high second-rounder.

""A couple of months ago, a year ago, I knew in the back of my mind this could happen,"" Gardner-Johnson's mom, Delatron Johnson said Tuesday. ""Now, the knowing is starting to turn into emotions. I feel like a pregnant woman. My emotions are all over the place.""

The draft starts at 7 p.m. Friday and noon Saturday. Following the first two Cocoa grads, fellow alum Jamel Dean, who played college ball at Auburn, should be drafted as well. If they aren't drafted, former Tigers Freddie Booth-Lloyd, Jamel Jackson and James Folston Jr. could find themselves in NFL camps as free agents.

The draft will be broadcast live on the NFL Network, ABC and ESPN.

Longtime Brevard County football coach Mike Vogt, Taylor's offensive line coach as a ninth-grader and senior, said when Florida Gators coaches first watched film of the offensive line prospect, they thought the video was set on a fast speed.

""He was driven his senior year,"" Vogt recalled. ""Halfway through that year, he just started dominating.""

Cocoa to Auburn to NFL: Jamel Dean declares for NFL draft

Both Gardner-Johnson and Dean graduated in December, Dean in 2014 with a 3.8 GPA, a year ahead of his former teammate. Former principal Stephanie Soliven, now an assistant superintendent for Brevard Schools, recalled the days when a younger Dean thought his future was in another field.

""He was always track. That was going to be his sport. He was tall and lanky with these big glasses. That is the picture that I have in my mind. To see him now, he's obviously not lanky and wearing big glasses.""

Dean, measured at 6-foot-1 and 206 pounds at the NFL Combine, was a draft question mark in the minds of many NFL analysts because of a history of knee problems. But he ran the second-fastest 40-yard dash of any defensive back, a 4.30, at the NFL Combine.

Gardner-Johnson, who ran a 4.48, typically has been rated higher, and he will host a Thursday night draft party for family and friends at the Rockledge Youth Football Field on Cogswell Street.

Soliven's top memory of him as a ninth-grader was a mix of determination of humility.

""He ran everywhere and talked to everybody, exactly how you see him today, doing everything 100 percent. He came in knowing what he wanted, but I remember how humble he was about the older players and how much he respected them.""

Chad and Amy Cryderman are bringing their popular oak-fired barbecued beef brisket, turkey, pulled pork and ribs to downtown Melbourne.

The couple opened their namesake eatery in July 2017 inside a former 1930s-era Cocoa Village gas station. Hours of operation: From 11 a.m. to whenever-they-run-out-of-food, Wednesdays through Saturdays.

Crydermans Barbecue's new second location debuts at 11 a.m. Wednesday at 401 E. New Haven Ave., inside the recently shuttered Sugar Shack Donuts building.

“Crydermans Barbecue is Central Texas-inspired. We dry-rub all of our meats. Nothing is sauced. Everything that we make is made in-house, homemade from scratch,"" Amy said, seated inside her downtown Melbourne restaurant.

""And they’re all recipes that we’ve developed over time. Some are still evolving. And we just have a passion for food,"" Amy said.

The Melbourne location measures nearly 3,000 square feet, markedly larger than the 700-square-foot Cocoa Village site. Nearly all seating is on an outdoor patio.

Amy said the second location ""literally fell into our lap."" The Merritt Island couple had a working relationship with Sugar Shack Donuts — the gourmet shop supplied donuts that were used to make bread pudding.

Sugar Shack Donuts shut down in downtown Melbourne last April, then closed in Cocoa Village in June. The Crydermans entered discussions to occupy the former Melbourne store, and the couple took over the building in September. Renovations and remodeling have occurred since.

Chad said the original Crydermans Barbecue — which is equipped with twin 1,000-gallon smokers — will serve as ""the house of meat"" for both restaurants. Side dishes, heavy prep work and sauces will be handled in the Melbourne production kitchen.

""Both of my smokers there are 22 foot from end-to-end. So I have 44 foot of cooking area,"" Chad said of his Cocoa Village eatery. ""Thirty-two foot of that is actual grill space.""

Amy said she plans to start opening on Tuesdays at both locations in a month or two.

""There's no other barbecue spots really around here. It's something we feel we could be successful in on this end of the county,"" Amy said of the Melbourne expansion.

""We had people asking us constantly when we were going to make it down this way. So it all just kind of fell in place, and we took the leap of faith,"" she said.

TAMPA (WFLA) - A Florida couple said I do country style at Redneck Mud Park in what might be the most redneck wedding ever.

Jeremy Biddle and Ahrielle Biddle decided they did not want an ordinary wedding so they decided to have the ceremony during the Trucks Gone Wild event at the park.

Jeremy tells WFLA that they wanted the ceremony to be as fun as possible so they got married in the back of their friend's pickup truck and the bride even wore an all white bikini as opposed to your average wedding dress.

The backroad romance even included a dip in the mud after the couple said I do.

Jeremy tells us that their love is ""country boy love"" and he couldn't be happier.

Congratulations and yee-haw to the happy couple.

753,Palm Coast woman tells how neighbors helped her outlast the Holocaust,"For her birthday, her father brought her a sewing basket.

Inside, he scratched a note in their native French: “To my daughter, Claire, for her sixth birthday, May 22, 1941. Your father, Nathan.”

Her mother, Sara Mytnowiecka, filled the basket with family photos — happy memories they made together before Germany’s occupation of Belgium forced Jews into hiding.

Claire spent her childhood frolicking with her aunt in the seaside sand at Blankenberge on Belgium’s northern coast, playing in the wooded Bois de la Cambre park on the outskirts of Brussels, rambling with cousins around a goldfish-filled lake at the lush Jardin Botanique near the Royal Palace and toying with buttons on her father’s tailor shop floor.

Less than a year after Nazis invaded in 1940, that came to an end.

Claire was sent to live with an elderly Catholic couple who could pass her off as their granddaughter, and her close-knit relatives split up among several non-Jewish households.

“By dividing themselves, they felt they gave the children a better chance to survive,” said Claire, 83, of Palm Coast, whose surname is now Soria.

They visited her in secret at first. But one by one, the loved ones in her photos disappeared, snatched up by the Gestapo and shipped to Auschwitz. All she had left was her sewing basket.

‘I could not stop crying’

Claire watched the Nazi troops and tanks parading through the streets of Brussels a few days after her fifth birthday.

Soldiers removed Belgian flags and hoisted the red, white and black Nazi banner in their place. Signs decrying Jews appeared soon after.

“We could never imagine (back) then what was on the horizon,” said Claire. “From one day to the next, everything changed.”

Her parents had to stop going to work, were forbidden from some public places and could only shop during certain hours. Though her youth shielded her from much of the discrimination adults experienced, she sensed a shift.

Her kindergarten friends were afraid to be seen playing with a girl wearing a yellow star, but Claire didn’t understand the correlation.

“I even sewed one on my clothing and didn’t see anything wrong with that,” she said — until her parents realized the stars made it easier for people to report any Jews they knew to the authorities.

“I don’t think in the beginning people had any idea of what was going on,” Claire said. But her parents, fearing arrest, asked their Catholic neighbors to shelter her.

Lambert and Lea Sabaux (pronounced Sa-bow) agreed to take her in and acted as if she were a visiting granddaughter. They loved her like one, too.

Claire’s parents, aunt and cousin Nina visited when they could. They sent her letters and postcards. She stowed them all in her sewing basket.

“That basket has always been paramount to my story,” Claire said. “It’s the one thing I’ve saved my whole life.”

When school was back in session in fall 1941, Jewish children were forbidden to attend.

Grandma and Grandpa, as Claire called her caretakers, thought she’d be safer with a French name. She chose Yvette in honor of one of her lost friends.

The Sabauxes took “Yvette” to a different school to enroll in first grade.

“If this child happens to be Jewish, the Gestapo will come and pick her up,” Claire recalled the principal’s warning. “So we left, and by noon (the Sabauxes) called the school and gave a phony excuse (for me dropping out).”

They found a tutor who would come to their home, but that, too, soon fell through. A teacher visiting each day could attract unwanted Gestapo attention.

A music education was the only option. Lea Sabaux, a former concert pianist, trained Claire to play, and Lambert Sabaux took her along when he played drums at a corner cafe on their street.

Claire was a homebody by nature, so she didn’t mind staying inside. She learned solitaire and spent hours playing card games to pass the time.

Her family’s visits became fewer and eventually stopped all together.

In March 1943, the Gestapo barged into the home where her mother, aunt and uncle were hiding. The three of them were among 1,638 Jews deported on the 20th transport train from Malines, Belgium, to Auschwitz.

Her father was arrested on a streetcar, and shipped out on the 21st train from Malines. Her beloved cousin Nina, then 17, was turned in by a neighbor. She, too, was sent to Auschwitz.

“I could not stop crying,” Claire said. “(I wondered), ‘Who’s next? How much more can I take?’”

Gestapo at the door

Word of an imminent Gestapo raid typically traveled through the Belgian underground resistance network in time for the Sabauxes to whisk Claire to safety in the countryside.

One time the Nazis caught them by surprise.

Claire was asleep upstairs, and her cousins, two sisters ages 7 and 9, had just turned up on the Sabauxes' doorstep seeking shelter.

Knowing they couldn’t care for three children, the Sabauxes took them in anyway. That’s when the Gestapo came knocking.

Lea Sabaux made a show of fumbling with her keys. She knew the cost of collaborating with Jews — they risked being shot or shipped to Auschwitz to join the rest of Claire’s family.

“I can’t open the door,” she called.

The officers moved on to the next house with a warning: “We’ll be back.”

They never returned, and the Sabauxes found Claire’s cousins a new safe house. Both girls survived the war.

Some of the Sabauxes’ neighbors were not so lucky.

“There were times I actually did see the Gestapo going from house to house and pulling people out of their homes and forcing them into trucks,” Claire said. “And if they did not do as they were told, they were shot. I remember that vividly.”

‘They risked their lives’

Claire’s story shares notable similarities with that of Anne Frank, with one distinct difference — Claire survived. But as the war went on, the odds of doing so seemed to diminish.

The Sabauxes lived near a railroad bridge frequently targeted in German airstrikes early in the war and by the Allies near the end of it.

And then there were the “Vengeance” missiles — the low-flying V-1 and the longer-range, deadlier V-2 — that Germany launched toward sites in England and Belgium.

Neither weapon was very accurate, and air raid sirens alerted civilians of incoming missiles that fell short of their targets. Claire learned to distinguish the difference by their sounds.

“Are they going to hit our area or not? You never knew for sure,” Claire said. They huddled in the basement until a second siren signaled it was safe.

“We would come back up and that’s when we could see down the street, up the street, homes demolished,” she said.

Food was rationed, and there wasn’t much.

One night at dinner, Claire’s place at the table was the only one set with food. She realized her caretakers had given her the last of their store and refused to eat alone.

“They said, ‘OK, go to bed, you’ll have it in the morning.’ And I did,” she said. “They were so caring. They just wanted what was best for me.”

The Allies eradicated Nazi forces from Belgium in early 1945, but Belgian towns continued to be a target for Vengeance missiles.

Claire doesn’t have a specific memory associated with the war’s end, but she recalled the trickle of Jews returning to town. “It always gave me hope that next would be my mom and dad,” she said.

But when her cousin Nina was released from Auschwitz, she brought bad news. Claire’s father had been tortured to death and her mother, aunt and uncle all were killed in the camp.

“I remember the day that Nina sat down with me and not only told me that my mom and dad were not coming back, but explained to me the fact that I am Jewish,” Claire said. “That was the beginning of the change in my life.”

Claire spent more than four years with the Sabauxes — and by then was much closer to them than to her surviving family — but the law gave custody of war orphans to adult relatives. Claire had to move in with an aunt.

“I was so upset,” she said. “(Grandma and Grandpa) were so nice to me. They risked their lives to save mine.”

She was permitted to visit them at first, but she would always come home crying. Her aunt stopped letting her see them.

“She did not realize that (my tears were) love,” Claire said.

Her aunt sent her away to summer camp to spend time with children her age, and then, at age 13, to the U.S. She didn’t speak English and was several years behind in school. Those were some of her darkest days, she said.

Claire eventually married and had three children. She has six grandkids and two great-grandchildren.

Grandma’s piano lessons paid off. Claire followed in her footsteps and became a piano teacher. She still has 14 students.

A year after Claire arrived in the U.S., she received correspondence from Lambert Sabaux.

“My dearest Yvette, these few lines are to let you know that it’s been terrible for us since you left. It’s sad to say but Grandma has suddenly gotten very ill,” the letter begins.

Lea Sabaux, hospitalized a few months after Claire’s departure, did not live much longer. Lambert Sabaux passed away soon after that.

“I could almost swear that it’s from a broken heart,” Claire said. She still cries every time she reads the letter.

It continues: “You wrote in your letter that you missed us very much. I know it. But that's life. The only thing I wish for you now is for you to be happy,” Lambert Sabaux wrote. “I must end my letter because I can't stop crying.”

Claire saved the letter in her sewing basket.

'Never forget'

The Holocaust survivors’ rallying cry has long been “never forget.”

As the youngest survivors age into their 70s, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., makes a special effort to preserve firsthand accounts in order to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike.

To honor this week's Days of Remembrance, established by Congress as the nation’s annual Holocaust commemoration, The News-Journal is sharing the individual accounts of four local Holocaust survivors.

Aimee Rubensteen, the museum's acquisitions coordinator, travels South Florida “rescuing the evidence of the Holocaust by speaking to firsthand witnesses,” she said, and collecting their World War II-era photos, letters, newspaper clippings, clothing and other artifacts of historical value.

“These original artifacts will be the things that teach the Holocaust to future generations,” Rubensteen said.

The museum’s mission is to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike and to encourage critical thinking about how and why those atrocities occurred.

Firsthand stories make those larger themes more personal.

“A lot of people don’t know about these specific, individual stories. The more we spread the word and expand the conversation, the better it is for everyone,” Rubensteen said.

Individuals or families who are interested in sharing their Holocaust artifacts or family keepsakes with the museum may contact Rubensteen at 786-496-2788 or arubensteen@ushmm.org to schedule an appointment.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190430/palm-coast-woman-tells-how-neighbors-helped-her-outlast-holocaust?rssfeed=true,2019-04-30T04:24:01Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

The driver of the semi that plowed into stopped traffic along Interstate 70 near Denver is in custody and will be charged with multiple counts of vehicular homicide, police said Friday.The runaway semi hit several cars and trucks Thursday in Lakewood, igniting a fiery and deadly crash. Lakewood is about 10 miles outside of Denver.Authorities have not determined precisely how many people were killed and continue to say multiple people died.Twenty-eight vehicles were involved in the crash: four of them semis and 24 cars, Lakewood Police Department Agent Ty Countryman told reporters Friday.The driver, who was behind the wheel of a flatbed truck loaded with lumber, was injured in the crash but not seriously, Countryman said. The driver will be in the Jefferson County Jail as soon as he's been medically cleared and booked.Countryman said there's no evidence of drugs or alcohol in the crash.When asked whether there were any mechanical issues with the truck, Countryman said it is something his department is looking into, but he believes even if there was a mechanical issue, vehicular manslaughter charges would still stick.The semi hit cars stuck in a jam due to evening rush hour and a prior crash farther ahead, Countryman said. Along with those killed, at least six people were hospitalized with injuries after the crash, according to the Lakewood Police Department.""We do know that I-70 eastbound traffic was at a standstill or close to a standstill because of a crash way out ahead of it,"" Countryman said at a news conference. ""The semi was eastbound and ended up colliding with the...cars that were stopped because of the accident ahead. That's all we know or we are releasing at this point.""Video from the scene showed towering orange flames and piles of lumber scattered across the highway. By Thursday night, the area was littered with smoldering ruins.Darin Barton was panhandling near the scene when the crash happened. He told KDVR that when the cab of the truck rolled over and flames ignited, he quickly dropped the sign he was holding and ran toward the cars.""It just caught on fire. And I just dropped my sign, took off running,"" Barton said. ""As soon as I flames, I headed under the bridge, grabbed three or four people out of a couple cars.""The fire was extinguished, but glowing embers and hot spots prevented investigators from immediately getting to the crashed vehicles. Investigators are working to match who was in each car, police said early Friday.It's unclear what made the vehicles ignite, Countryman said, adding that he does not know what was in the semis other than the one that appeared to be carrying lumber.""This is looking to be one of the worst accidents we've had here in Lakewood,"" he said.The Denver West Parkway bridge over I-70 sustained significant structural damage from the fire, authorities said. The portion of I-70 affected by the crash is closed overnight in both directions.",https://www.wesh.com/article/truck-driver-facing-multiple-counts-of-vehicular-homicide-after-horrific-crash-near-denver/27285881,2019-04-26T15:33:00Z,WESH-TV,Couple,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789

765,'Avengers: Endgame': The best times to take potty breaks -- if you must,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Fans are so excited to see ""Avengers: Endgame"" that I doubt they'll think any time is the right one to pause for a potty break, but some times will certainly be better than others.

[WARNING: Spoilers coming your way.]

With the final movie being just more than three hours long, you should probably skip the large slushie. Otherwise, you'll be making more trips to the restroom than your superfan heart can afford.

[RELATED: 5 scenes from 'Avengers' movies that played crucial roles, all leading up to 'Endgame' | 'Avengers: Endgame': This is how excited fans are for movie's release]

In the event that you do need to go, CBS News has some suggestions on what times are best for you to take care of business and avoid missing anything major.

The following scenes are going to be some of your best options:

When the San Francisco title card comes on screen: This is just about 30 minutes into the movie and you can afford to miss it if you're already familiar with the plots, since it's mostly Scott just piecing them together, according to CBS. But honestly, if you already have to go then, this was poor planning on your part.

When Hulk is having lunch: This is a more reasonable time to have to use the restroom, since it's just over an hour into the movie. CBS News said some of the characters sit down for lunch and have a funny -- yet somewhat cring-inducing -- conversation. If you're only going to go once throughout the film, the following 15 minutes is your best bet.

When Tony and Pepper are talking: Also about an hour into the movie, Tony Stark and Pepper Potts sit down for a chat. Fans of the couple will enjoy this scene, according to CBS, but it isn't all that important to the movie as a whole. Totally up to you, but there's only one more opportunity after this one.

When the New Jersey title card comes on screen: This is your last chance to go if you care about this movie at all. CBS said this is a moment of mostly nostalgia, so you can easily piece it together if you miss a few minutes. If you have to go after this, your options are: A) hold it, or B) miss something crucial. You do you, pal.

If none of the times above work for you and your bladder, CBS just has one solid piece of advice to keep in mind: just don't miss the last hour. It's intense and critically important.

[MORE: 'Avengers: Endgame': How much will Marvel's epic finale make this weekend? | Is 'Avengers' the 'Endgame?' Other blockbusters coming in 2019]

The good news -- well, kinda -- is that ""Endgame,"" unlike the other movies, doesn't have a post-credits scene. Once it's over, you can head straight to the long bathroom line and discuss the ending with fellow fans.

Still looking for tickets? These links should help.

766,Giddens withdraws FSC application following anti-gay slur complaint,"Former Lakeland Police Chief Larry Giddens was accused of telling a LPD lieutenant he looked like a ""f------ f-----."" Giddens was to become Florida Southern's head of security at the end of May.

LAKELAND — Former Lakeland Police Chief Larry Giddens has withdrawn his application as head of security at Florida Southern College following accusations he called a Lakeland Police Department lieutenant an anti-gay slur when they encountered each other while riding bikes.

Giddens told Lt. Eric Harper he looked like a ""f------ f-----,"" Harper told The Ledger earlier this week.

Giddens, who served as police chief for five years, withdrew from the top security job at FSC on Wednesday, according to sources. A college official, who declined to be named, confirmed the news but declined to elaborate further.

Harper, who has worked at the department for more than 16 years, said he reported the slur to Florida Southern College's director of human resources on April 15.

""It was a derogatory homophobic slur,"" Harper said. ""You just can't talk like that.""

Harper said he fired back at the chief after the insult.

""Larry, the P.D. is a better place with you gone,"" Harper said he told Giddens.

Giddens could not be reached for comment.

He had been hired by Florida Southern to begin work as director of campus safety at the end of May. He retired from the police department in February.

He told the Ledger in January that he was excited Florida Southern had chosen him as the new head of security.

""I think it’s a great school, a very professional college and I look forward to it,"" Giddens told the Ledger after he had announced his pending retirement.

But a month after he retired, a complaint was filed by former LPD Sgt. Pat Guity accusing Giddens and then current LPD attorney Donna Perry of violating numerous policies, including fraternization and untruthfulness when the two were accused of becoming involved in a romantic relationship.

Perry, 38, is no longer with the department. She signed a $17,296 severance package April 2 after working at the police department for six months.

The Ledger learned of Harper's complaint earlier this week when it received a tip by a third party.

Harper and LPD Detective Eddie Mingus said they were off-duty riding bikes on April 13 with dozens of others on the Fort Fraser Trail.

Mingus told Harper he saw Giddens riding during a previous weekend and the former chief had been somewhat standoffish and looked angry. He warned Harper that Giddens may be on the ride and mentioned his previous testiness.

""The plan was not to say anything,"" Harper said.

As Mingus and Harper prepared to ride, the two said Giddens glared at them.

Harper said his relationship with Giddens had been professional but tense at times during work.

""He could be overbearing,"" Harper said, mentioning that he would question Giddens when he disagreed with something.

Giddens pulled in front of the two as everyone started to ride in a tight group, Harper said.

But he soon slowed down and pulled next to Harper, placing the lieutenant in the middle between Giddens and Mingus.

Harper said he felt Giddens' glare, but chose not to speak to him. Then, Harper said Giddens told him he looked like a ""f------ f-----.""

Mingus confirmed he heard the slur.

""He never said he was kidding,"" Harper said.

Harper said he thought about it a couple of days before going to the college.

""People needed to know what he said,"" Harper said.

767,Paula Deen comes to Destin,"DESTIN — In Paula Deen’s world, butter is an essential part of the food pyramid and “y'all” is said often.

The atmosphere in her restaurant is no different.

In early March, Paula Deen’s Family Kitchen opened in the Destin Commons. On Friday, Deen attended the official ribbon cutting and held a book signing. But before that, Deen made time to speak to the media day on Thursday.

As soon as she walked into her restaurant, the Queen of Southern Cuisine lit up. With a cheerful “good morning” to everyone and a smile on her face, she instantly started introducing herself around the room.

“Hey y’all, I’m Paula,” she said nonchalantly.

Deen is no stranger to the Panhandle. The Georgia native spoke of many summers spent visiting her grandparents in the Sunshine State.

“Florida has been a big, big part of my life,” she said. “Both sets of my grandparents lived in Florida. The only place we went on vacation was to Florida, to grandparents' homes.”

And when spring break came along, Deen always found herself back at the beach.

“When I hit 13 and 14, I knew where it was happening,” she said. “When it was my children’s turn, I would come down to chaperone and watch them like a hawk because I knew I knew what they could be doing because I had lived it.”

So it only made sense to open restaurants in Destin and Panama City.

With dishes like fried chicken, beef pot roast, chicken-fried pork chops and old-fashioned southern meatloaf, it’s hard to pick just one. But Deen said her favorite dish on the menu would have to be the fried chicken.

“The pork chop is right up there with the fried chicken 'cause it’s got gravy on it with our mashed potatoes,” Deen said as she smacked her lips. “And the sides, oh my gosh, you have to get the macaroni and cheese, and the creamed corn is out of this world.”

Deen contributes her down-to-earth demeanor to the fact that she already knew who she was by the time she became a household name.

“I was 42 when I started my business and by then I was who I was and I knew what was really important,” she said. “I know that it can be here one minute and gone the next.”

Meeting her fans and customers is one of her favorite things.

“Some people I meet make me laugh real hard and some make me cry,” she said. “It’s amazing how much people can tell me in a matter of a couple of minutes.”

Without fail, Deen said there are two things she always hears at every book signing or event.

“’You saved my life’ or ‘you’re such an inspiration to me,’” she said. “That kind of stops me, you know? When you’re looking down the tube of that camera, you never know who’s watching and you never know what’s going on in their life at that particular time.”

Her southern hospitality is evident as she personally meets and talks to every employee at the restaurant. She thanks them for sacrificing their time and makes sure they know that she is there for them, not the other way around.",https://www.thedestinlog.com/news/20190425/paula-deen-comes-to-destin?rssfeed=true,2019-04-25T15:52:58Z,The Destin Log,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

769,Adorable grandpa wears matching suit for prom photos with dateless granddaughter,"- A 67-year-old grandfather from California is the hero of the internet after getting dressed up and taking pictures with his granddaughter who didn't have a date for the senior prom.

To make sure the photos were even better, he even matched his suit to her prom dress!

My papa knew I didn’t have a date to my prom so he matched me !!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/nmYkt8qn4y — 💛Kaylah Milan💛 (@deary_kay) April 22, 2019







Kaylah Bell, 17, tells Fox 35 she had a couple of people in mind to take her to the prom, but they flaked out. Rather than take photos in her gorgeous dress by herself, she asked her ""papa"", Alvin Hackett, to take them with her.

""I asked by grandpa to take my pictures because he is the flyest guy I know! He has a great sense of style!""

Kaylah had a gorgeous, queen-like gown ready for prom and Hackett already had a closet full of suits--including one that would match her dress perfectly.

771,Study links smoking with decreased fertility,"A recent study shows smoking while undergoing in vitro fertilization, can impact a woman’s chance of a successful pregnancy.

The study looked at more than 12,000 cycles using assisted reproductive technology.

Researchers learned women who smoked while undergoing IVF were less likely to have the procedure result in a successful pregnancy than women who were nonsmokers.

Dr. Rebecca Flyckt, of Cleveland Clinic, did not take part in the study, but said smoking definitely has an impact on fertility.

“We know that smoking can actually affect the hormone environment and the eggs in our ovaries,” she said. “Women who smoke have an earlier time to menopause and run out of eggs faster than women who don’t smoke.”

Flyckt said when women smoke, it typically takes them longer to get pregnant.

“Smokers have a higher risk of infertility, and they have a higher risk of needing fertility treatments because of all the effects of cigarettes on the ovary and ovarian function,” she said.

In addition to having an unsuccessful IVF procedure, Flyckt said previous research shows smoking while undergoing IVF can increase the risk of a tubal or ectopic pregnancy, or even increase the chance that the pregnancy could end in miscarriage.

When couples are at the point where they are ready to try assisted reproductive technology, Flyckt believes it’s in their best interest to make sure they are taking the proper steps to increase their chances of a successful pregnancy.

“Once couples get to IVF, they’re investing thousands of dollars to get the best possible chance of having a baby,” she said. “I think any couple thinking about this study should know that smoking can really reduce that chance.”

Complete results of the study can be found in the Journal of Women’s Health.

772,Barron Collier to banking: Michael Nathan winds down college career with job lined up,"CLOSE In this 2017 video, Mike Nathan, a former Barron Collier lacrosse star, walks on at North Carolina. Naples Daily News

He has a banking job lined up after graduation but Michael Nathan isn't ready to trade in his lacrosse uniform for a suit and tie just yet.

The Barron Collier graduate hopes to extend his playing career a little longer when his team, the North Carolina Tar Heels, battles No. 8 Syracuse on Thursday night during the ACC tournament.

If North Carolina loses, Nathan's season could be over, because the Tar Heels aren't currently ranked in the top 20 teams and only 17 teams received NCAA tournament bids.

Buy Photo Michael Nathan, a senior at University of North Carolina, was a standout boys lacrosse player at Barron Collier High School. Despite his talent few schools offered him scholarships to play lacrosse. However, after playing a year at Colby College in Maine, Nathan decided to try out as a walk on for the 2016 national champion North Carolina Tar Heels.

Win or lose, the defenseman said he has no regrets with his decision to walk on at UNC in the summer of 2016 after transferring from Colby College in Maine. In doing so, Nathan became the first Southwest Florida boys lacrosse star to play for a traditional and elite college power.

The 6-foot-3 student-athlete said he's made friends with teammates and has savored his time in Chapel Hill.

“When I graduate soon, we still have each other for the rest of our lives,"" Nathan said of his teammates. ""And that’s a brotherhood I’m proud of.”

Off the field, Nathan has studied business administration at North Carolina's prestigious Kenan-Flagler Business School.

""Everyone I’m surrounded by is a very elite student,"" he said. ""In order to become on myself, I had to put my work ethic in lacrosse into the classroom.”

Nathan enjoyed working as an intern at JP Morgan Chase & Co. in Charlotte, where he plans to begin working after graduating from UNC on May 12.

His journey began in Naples, where he excelled on the field as he garnered numerous awards such as being named the Daily News' top lacrosse player for two years straight, and all-state and All-American his senior year at Barron Collier High School in 2015. He also earned top marks in the classroom, as a National Honor Society member who graduated summa cum laude.

After graduating from Barron Collier, Nathan's goal was to attend an elite school and play lacrosse. He said Yale University recruited him, and he had the grades but missed out because his SAT scores weren't high enough. So he enrolled at Colby College, an upper-echelon liberal arts college, where he played Division III lacrosse for one season.

The two coaches who recruited him were gone before the 2016 season began; the head coach died at age 35 from a heart attack on a treadmill, and an assistant accepted a coaching job at a Wisconsin school.

So Nathan decided to continue pursuing his dream and tried out at Carolina in the summer of '16, just weeks after the Tar Heels won the NCAA championship.

Head coach Joe Breschi said Nathan has exemplified what he expects of players.

""He’s come so far,"" Breschi said. ""He came in here with a terrific mindset and a terrific approach, work ethic. A great personality, all the things you want in a teammate.""

While Nathan was ""just a little green from lacrosse experience, certainly at this level,"" Breschi said, he was a quick study.

“Everything we’ve asked him to do, he’s been about to come out and get it done,"" he said. “He’s a very dialed in young man and knows what he wants. And he had the self-motivation in academics as well as on the lacrosse field. He’s earned everything he’s gotten.”

Ed Calkins of Naples, the chairman of US Lacrosse — the national governing body for men's and women's lacrosse in the U.S. — agreed with Breschi. Nathan worked as an intern a couple summers ago for Calkins at his North Naples investment management firm where he's a partner.

“You look at Michael’s path and it’s an incredibly inspiring story,"" said Calkins, who played on Princeton's 1992 NCAA championship team.

""You talk to him off the field and you look at what he’s been able to accomplish in terms of his academics. What his story tells you from his lacrosse perspective is certainly the perseverance and hard work and passion to achieve goals will translate directly into his professional life and beyond.

""He’s somebody you want to be successful.”

Nathan also realizes he's a role model for youngsters. Southwest Florida youth players visited Chapel Hill and nearby Duke University in late March to play lacrosse against other club teams and see first-hand facilities at both venerable schools and lacrosse powerhouses.

Calkins joined other parents who attended with their children. He said Nathan took the time to meet with the young men and answer their questions.

""He probably wasn’t given all the opportunity coming out of high school that he should have been,"" Calkins said.

""But he blazed his own trail and worked incredibly hard and achieved his dream to play for a prestigious Division I program, and not just be on the roster. He starts and has started for a couple years now.”

Long Island and upstate New York, Baltimore and other Northeastern regions have produced the best lacrosse talent for years but Nathan believes Florida is making inroads.

Nathan said he has watched the level of lacrosse improve in Naples and Fort Myers in the last couple years. He attributed this in part to the coaching, pointing to his former Barron coach Trent Carter, now at Canterbury School in Fort Myers; former college player and pro Brett Queener who built the Gulf Coast High program into a regional power; and Kevin Dugan, a former Yale assistant coach who played at Notre Dame and now heads the Sweetlax Florida youth lacrosse club based out of Community School in Naples.

“Players have all the resources they need if they want to become successful,"" Nathan said of Southwest Florida youth lacrosse programs and school teams. ""Those kids are much better than I was at that age.""

Breschi agreed, saying lacrosse is growing across the U.S., especially in the Sunshine State.

""For him to come from Naples, it shows young kids there that they can fulfill their dreams both academically and athletically. And that's what he's done.""",http://rssfeeds.naplesnews.com/~/601147998/0/naples/home~Barron-Collier-to-banking-Michael-Nathan-winds-down-college-career-with-job-lined-up/,2019-04-24T12:53:52Z,Naples Daily News,Couple,"1100 Immokalee Rd, Naples, FL 34110, USA",FL,34110
773,Ronsisvalle: Turning that inner voice from foe to ally,"Marriage counseling can be tough for counselors as well as those seeking counsel. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

I was 25 years old and just beginning to see patients as a psychologist in training.

I’ll never forget the moment I watched the first couple I would ever see as a marital therapist drive up to the clinic and walk in for their first appointment.

The thing that struck me was how successful they appeared. The husband stepped out of a Mercedes and he appeared to be at least twice my age.

His wife was wearing high-end designer clothes that I could only dream of purchasing for my new bride.

Buy Photo Dr. Mike Ronsisvalle (Photo: FLORIDA TODAY FILE)

As I walked into the waiting room to meet them I had a rush of insecurity wash over me. I tried to fake confidence as I extended my hand toward my new clients.

“I’m Mike, we spoke on the phone yesterday,” I said.

The husband looked at me in disbelief, then looked at his wife and said, “here’s the big counselor you brought me to see, huh?”

It was a humiliating moment in large part because I felt almost as if I agreed with him.

That little voice inside my head was screaming negative messages about me, my value as a budding professional and the reality that I was about to waste everyone’s time pretending to be a competent psychologist.

As the session went on, my inner voice got louder and louder.

“They see right through me.”

“Don’t blow this.”

“I’m an imposter right now who has no idea what to say next.”

It was indeed a torturous 50 minutes of psychotherapy. I could not have been any more relieved when they walked out the door.

What astounded me even more was the fact that they made another appointment. I had to go through all this again.

After that first session I used the husband’s condescending statement and my negative inner self-talk as motivation to learn everything I could about marital therapy.

I was determined to utilize the same “succeed or suffer” mentality that had driven much of my success and self-discipline in the past.

I’m sure that many of you have utilized the same critical voice as motivation for success in different areas of your life.

How many of us have tapped that monster within to motivate us to train harder for athletics or get through rigorous seasons in our professional life, or even commit to a difficult marriage?

Many of us use our critical voice to help us hone in on our faults and weaknesses before other people have a chance to identify them and use them against us.

And this is essentially the paradox of that monster within us all: it undermines and attacks us to protect us from feeling the shame of failure and criticism by other people.

So over time, the voice of the monster within can essentially cripple us and our attempts to succeed and keep us stuck in an unhealthy pattern of negative self-talk and criticism.

There is a better way.

I spoke with my supervisor about the couple and eluded to the fact that I was using my feelings of inadequacy as fuel to drive my success with them.

“When he’s condescending again I will use that as motivation to study harder,” I said with as much bravado as I could muster.

More: Ronsisvalle: Getting through to the 'disconnected husband'

More: Ronsisvalle: Is civility gone and kindness a thing of the past?

More: Ronsisvalle: The shortest path may not be the best option

My supervisor immediately cautioned me with a warning about using the monster within for that purpose.

“Mike, using those self-critical messages will ensure that you approach your profession driven more by fear of failure than by passion or inspiration,” he said.

His words struck me right between the eyes. I resonated deeply with the idea that real joy had almost become an elusive emotion since I started my training.

I had traded my joy for anxiety and stress about my performance. Over the next several weeks I used my supervision time to develop some strategies to ensure that I no longer gave the monster within any leverage in my life.

And sure enough, as I practiced these strategies the self-critical messages became less and less intense.

Here’s the simple steps I used to crush the power of the voice of the critical monster in my head.

Self-distancing. The solution to self-critical thoughts isn’t to attempt to shut down the monster’s voice completely. That will never work.

The voice will only come back stronger and with more intensity. Trying to run from the emotions created by the self-critical thoughts will only create a negative cycle of rumination in which you feel the negative emotions, then spend inordinate amounts of time trying to examine why you are always so self-critical.

When you practice the art of self-distancing you replace the first person pronoun “I” with pronouns that are more distant like “you” when you are talking to yourself.

For instance, when the silver fox insulted me in the waiting room I rehearsed a thought that sounded something like this: “Why give another person the power to make you feel like a fake?” or “ why do you feel like such a sham now when you feel so confident in the classroom?”

I know it seems too easy, but the first person thought mode actually feels very personal. Self-distancing allows you to pause, step away from the situation and intentionally consider a rational response as if it had happened to someone else.

Normalize the monster’s voice. When we find that we have entered the negative cycle of self-criticism, one of the best strategies we can employ is to normalize the idea of that monster’s voice in your head.

“Oh boy, here we go again. That monstrous critical voice is at it again.”

Positioning the self-critical voice as something that is likely to happen allows us to detach from the criticism instead of identifying with it and allowing it to dominate us in the moment.

Value the process over the outcome. Once we begin to feel some distance from the monster’s critical voice, we can begin to change the story we are rehearsing about failure or inadequacy.

If we can truly begin to believe that struggle and failure is a part of life then we are in a position to learn from whatever situation we find ourselves in.

We can now rehearse new thoughts in the moment that become much more productive.

For instance, with my couple in marital therapy I began to rehearse these messages: “I can’t control whether or not this couple gets better. I can do everything possible to prepare for these sessions and just let my best effort be good enough.”

These are the moments that I am learning to deal with difficult clients who throw me curve balls in session. This is an awesome learning experience.

The key to choosing process over outcomes is based squarely on our willingness to embrace our own brokenness and to allow ourselves to exercise self-compassion.

Practice transcendence. The opposite of self-criticism is not affirmation, it is actually transcendence.

That means that the real solution to an obsession with the voice of that critical monster in your head is to believe beyond any shadow of a doubt that we are a part of something bigger.

In my work with the couple years ago, I intentionally rehearsed these kinds of transcendent thoughts in my preparation for the sessions with them: “this couple is very different from me, but they have value and inherent worth and their marriage deserves a chance to thrive.”

The outward focus of the inherent worth of my clients and the value of marriage as an institution in our culture set me free to get outside of myself and my own fear and to focus on the needs of the clients.

That transcendent outward focus opened the door to my own self-compassion and it crushed the remaining power of the critical monster within me.

782,Review: Country star Kelsea Ballerini brings 'Miss Me More' tour to sold-out Hertz Arena in Estero,"CLOSE The 25-year-old Knoxville native sang her hits during her ""Miss Me More"" tour stop in Estero. Ashley Collins, ashley.collins@naplesnews.com; 239-213-6029

Country music star Kelsea Ballerini is unapologetically herself, even while performing her first arena-headlining tour at the sold-out Hertz Arena on Thursday night.

Wearing a fiery red outfit with knee-high boots and an equally high ponytail, the 25-year-old Knoxville native commanded attention when she first hit the stage with her girl power anthem ""Miss Me More.""

""I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings

Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you

Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more (I miss me more)""

The hit song also happens to be the name of Ballerini's 14-city tour, which kicked off April 11 in Maryland and features two Florida stops, including St. Augustine.

Coming up at Hertz: ZZ Top to play at Hertz Arena for 50th anniversary tour with Cheap Trick. Tickets on sale this week.

Ballerini was joined by country newcomer Brandon Ratcliff, who performed a 15-minute set, and Brett Young, who had nearly every female concertgoer swooning as he sung his No. 1 single on Billboard's Country Airplay chart, ""Here Tonight.""

Young, who's from California, had the crowd going for nearly an hour with his Cali-country hits, and it seemed as though concertgoers couldn't possibly get more excited until Ballerini took to the stage.

She sang several tracks from her latest album “Unapologetically,” including her cheeky “Get Over Yourself” and her more reflective tracks “Machine Heart” and “Legends.” She also performed songs off her first album ""The First Time,"" including “Dibs,” “Love Me Like You Mean It” and “Peter Pan.” She closed the show with a high-energy performance of “This Feeling,” a mainstream pop song she and The Chainsmokers collaborated on.

Hot off her sophomore album ""Unapologetically,"" to say Ballerini's musical career is on fire is an understatement. She was recently inducted as the newest and youngest current member of the Grand Ole Opry by one of country's leading ladies, Carrie Underwood.

In between songs, Ballerini spoke from the heart, sharing intimate stories behind ""Unapologetically,"" which she said she recorded while she was going through her first real breakup and growing into her own as a woman. She also shared how excited she was to receive the honor from the Grand Ole Opry earlier this month.

""It's the peak of life,"" she told the crowd, then joking that it could only go downhill from here. ""It was the biggest honor of all time.""

Ballerini, now a two-time Grammy nominated artist, moved to Nashville with her mom when she was only 15 to pursue a music career. She dedicated ""In Between,"" a song off her latest album, to her mom, who was in the crowd Thursday night for the three-hour show, along with Ballerini's Australian singer-songwriter hubby Morgan Evans.

But it was the fans Ballerini kept coming back to.

""Thank you for making a 15-year-old girl's wish come true,"" she told concertgoers before stepping off the stage and walking around the arena to take selfies and shake hands with fans while singing her hit song ""Love Me Like You Mean It.""

Ballerini is a force to be reckoned with not just in country radio but the music industry in general. In the past she's opened for some of country's biggest acts like Alan Jackson, Lady Antebellum, Tim McGraw, Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban. Now that she finally has her own tour she can show off how versatile she is as an artist. She can go from country to pop and isn't afraid to cross genres.

And she also isn't afraid to strap on a guitar or play the drums when the occasion arises. She was completely in her element when it was just her and the mic. A couple of times she took a break from skipping around the stage to autograph posters all while still singing.

She's definitely on her way and while there's no telling what Ballerini will do next, one thing is for certain: She won't apologize for being herself.

783,Tyler Florence and 'The Great Food Truck Race' rolled through Fort Myers — here's the aftermath,"CLOSE Tyler Florence and the 'Great Food Truck Race' in Fort Myers Andrew West, News-Press

Food Network's ""The Great Food Truck Race"" and chef-host Tyler Florence spent a whirlwind 48 hours in Fort Myers. It was crazy. Let's recap.

The calls and messages started coming Monday night.

Several out-of-town food trucks, all with little history and not much of a social-media following, reached out to local breweries, venues and other area food trucks hoping to secure last-minute spots at their sites.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

""We got a voicemail and an Instagram message from a couple of the trucks Monday,"" said Jen Gratz-Whyte, owner of Fort Myers Brewing Co. in Gateway.

""I was like: We book food trucks weeks in advance, who do these people think they are?""

Competitors on ""The Great Food Truck Race,"" that's who.

The Food Network reality competition rolled through the Fort Myers area Wednesday and Thursday, drawing legions of fans and interested food lovers to downtown Fort Myers, Fort Myers Brewing, Millennial Brewing and Old Soul Brewing during a whirlwind 48 hours of production and reality-show theatrics.

The show also brought its host, celebrity chef Tyler Florence, to town. The Food Network star checked in with his contestants — and with local restaurants.

""I'm all about craft,"" Florence said.

""This show takes me all over the country and I love finding those little, out-of-the-way places that truly celebrate the craft of food.""

Florence made stops at Bennett's Fresh Roast in Fort Myers, Dixie Fish Co. on Fort Myers Beach and Rosy Tomorrows Heritage Farm in North Fort Myers. The first two will be featured in a digital special Florence is shooting in conjunction with ""The Great Food Truck Race.""

His visit to Rosy's came at the behest of a certain food writer (ahem), who thought the chef might enjoy the farm-restaurant's unique approach.

""This is incredible,"" Florence said after tasting Rosy Tomorrows' turmeric-pickled eggs, its mangrove salt, its ice cream churned from milk squeezed from Brie, the Jersey dairy cow out back who Florence had fed just moments earlier.

""This is Michelin-level stuff happening out here. This is crazy.""

Almost as crazy as leading a band of food trucks up and down the East Coast of the U.S. for a few months.

The past two days' events will be featured in season 10 of ""The Great Food Truck Race,"" which Florence and executive producer Jeffrey L. Weaver said should air in August.

The show pits food trucks against each other, with $50,000 in prize money at stake for the winner. In each new city, the trucks vie for sales. Each truck starts with the same budget for ingredients. The truck that nets the lowest profit is sent packing at the end of each episode.

The reality of this reality show became apparent Wednesday.

After the mob scene that was Fort Myers Brewing Co., where a trio of the show's trucks had set up for the afternoon, Florence headed to Madea Made, a barbecue and Southern comfort-food truck that had parked alongside Jonesez BBQ at the corner of Crystal Drive and Metro Parkway in south Fort Myers.

Madea's quiet, dusty lot stood in stark contrast to the throngs of people at the brewery in Gateway.

""This is the competition,"" Florence said.

""These guys choose the venues themselves. They make these decisions on their own. Madea chose to tag along with Jonesez, which has an amazing reputation in the area, but this is not the scene we saw at the brewery, that's for sure.""

Back at Fort Myers Brewing, Fort Myers resident Les Butler was first in (a very long) line for NOLA Creations 504, a Cajun-Creole truck offering po' boys, beignets and gator jambalaya.

Butler placed his order and then waited a solid 15 minutes for his $12 shrimp po' boy with Cajun rice to be delivered.

""Delicious,"" he said, smiling.

Butler and his wife, Mary, got to Fort Myers Brewing at 1 p.m. Wednesday. The trucks were supposed to start serving at 2 p.m., but due to ""competitiony things,"" as Gratz-Whyte put it, they didn't open their windows till almost 4 p.m.

""We've just been hanging out, sipping beers,"" Butler said. ""No complaints here.""

That same vibe permeated Old Soul Brewing in Fort Myers, where patrons waited Wednesday for the Frank n Slides truck. Erin Croop of Cape Coral sipped a pineapple kombucha on a late lunch break as the first scents of bacon and sizzling meat filled Old Soul's parking lot.

""I'm just a food lover,"" Croop said. ""I had to come and see what this was all about.""

Late Thursday morning the show shifted gears to downtown Fort Myers, where the trucks competed in a head-to-head challenge on First Street. At noon, some of the trucks dispersed, including Rolling Indulgence, a 1950s-style diner truck that headed to nearby Millennial Brewing.

""We had no idea what to expect,"" Millennial's owner Kyle Cebull said. ""We always host food trucks, but this was another level of drama and intrigue.""

Florence said the show will continue rolling through South Florida in the coming weeks, though he couldn't pinpoint where exactly.

As for the love Fort Myers showed him and his contestants, Florence seemed genuinely blown away.

""This is our 10th season, 10 seasons of me chasing taco trucks all around the country,"" he said, ""and I've never seen anything quite like this.

""Fort Myers rolled out the red carpet for us. It's been a great time.""

785,Appreciate your roots: Give trees room to grow,"Roots need room to grow and protective covering, such as mulch. (Photo: Larry Lesko)

We admire our beautiful trees, but often neglect the sizable part of the tree that is hidden underground. Roots anchor a tree and provide the mechanism to take in water, oxygen, and nutrients.

They may not get our attention like flowers and leaves, but they are the key to the health of the plant. A thinning or declining crown and poor growth above surface may indicate problems with the root system.

In Master Gardener training I learned the value of roots and how expansive a root system must be to maintain tree health. Associate Professor Sam Hand Jr., FAMU Extension Faculty, says, “Tree roots can extend up to three times the height of a tree or more than three or four times the area of the crown spread.”

Larry Lesko (Photo: Special to the Democrat)

This means that small or micro roots extend well beyond the drip line unless they are constrained by an impervious surface such as a driveway, house foundation, or sidewalk. If you have several small trees, or even one or two large trees in your yard, you probably have tree roots throughout your yard.

All roots grow relatively close to the surface to better capture water and mineral nutrients (which are essentially vitamins for the tree). Sugar feeds the tree and makes its own in the leaves through photosynthesis. Respiration is important as well. Roots must breathe oxygen that is captured between the soil particles to live and grow. A dense compacted soil squeezes out the air, making respiration difficult.

The majority of the major structural roots and small micro roots (which do most of the respiration and water capture) lie in the first foot of soil, which has the most oxygen, organic material, and nutrients. Almost all roots grow within two feet of the soil surface in our area.

Here are some things you can do to help your tree roots stay healthy and thrive:

Give them room to breathe. Soil compaction is often the cause for poor, slow growth of a tree. In urban areas the greatest limitation to root growth is lack of oxygen. Construction, heavy equipment, parking, and driving on soil can severely compact the soil.

Spread mulch under landscape trees. Mulch helps retain moisture, stabilize soil temperatures, and protects roots from damage. Nature provides a protective mulch with fallen leaves. We can also use these leaves as mulch or spread additional mulch. Keep mulch away from the trunk but apply two to four inches out far as you can go.

Plant trees as far away from impervious surfaces as possible. Tree roots cannot grow under house foundations and they are constrained by features such as driveways.If too close, roots can also damage driveways or sidewalks as they grow larger. Be aware when planning a planting location. The right plant for the right place is a basic principle for Florida-Friendly Landscaping (FFL). For more information, visit the FFL website, https://ffl.ifas.ufl.edu/.

Give trees a chance. When planting new trees, it is much more important to dig a hole wider than deep. Keep the root ball a couple inches above the surface but make the hole wider than twice the width of the root ball, at least. The wider the better, especially in compact soils. Cut any roots that have grown in circles within the growing container to break them from the habit of growing in circles. Don’t forget that watering the root ball is necessary until the tree can expand its root system to survive more independently.

Watch out for new construction. Root injury during construction can cause the death or decline in trees. Protecting the area under the tree branches will give the tree a reasonable chance of survival. Protecting a larger area is better.

Tree roots are like every other living organism. They need proper habitat to grow up healthy. If you nourish the roots, chances are your trees will grow strong and sturdy. Trees are a key component of the local ecosystem. Caring for the roots will nurture the trees which in turn provide habitat for plants, insects, birds, and other living things.

788,Witnesses help Tampa Police arrest hit and run suspect,"Tampa Police arrested Danielle Swanson, 34 Tuesday night after a serious hit and run accident on Davis Islands.

Police say Swanson hit a man as he crossed East Davis Boulevard and then she just drove away.

A Hillsborough County woman was in a car with her husband and were just leaving Davis Islands when a fast moving car sped by them.

""There was a car that came, actually cut us off the street before and was just swerving left and right,"" said Trish who did not want her last name to be used.

She and her husband then witnessed the accident.

""She didn't even stop and she hit him. A few other cars had stopped and pedestrians came running and she took off, so we followed her,"" said Trish.

They called 9-1-1 and then provided a dispatcher turn by turn descriptions of where they were going.

""She was pretty much just going from curbs to medians erratically, pretty much just all of downtown Tampa and we were on the phone to 9-1-1,"" said Trish.

Tampa Police officers were able to catch up to Swanson at Nebraska Avenue and 17th Street and arrest her.

Police say the couple who followed Swanson may have prevented other serious accidents.

""We have somebody that's impaired, who already struck somebody and left the scene, so they are a very dangerous driver,"" said Steve Hegarty with the Tampa Police department.

Swanson is now charged with leaving the scene of an accident with serious injuries and D.U.I.",https://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/witnesses-help-tampa-police-arrest-hit-and-run-suspect/1950950607,2019-04-24T21:54:18Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
789,Beyoncé shares Orlando dancers' moves with her 127 million Instagram followers,"ORLANDO, Fla. - There is a new dance challenge started by Beyoncé sweeping the internet and two Orlando dancers are going viral after the music sensation shared their moves on her social media platforms.



The #BeforeILetGoChallenge showcases people dancing to a new song from Beyoncé's latest album, ""Homecoming."" Queen B is posting videos of people doing the dance on Instagram, including moves choreographed by Fred Barthell and Fabron Alexis.



""This is crazy. Honestly, I don't know where to start,"" Barthell said.



It started a week ago, after Beyoncé's new Netflix documentary and live album dropped.



Barthell and Alexis were in the dance studio the next day. The pair spent about 20 minutes choreographing a dance to her remake of the song, ""Before I Let Go.""



""It reminded me of the cha cha slide and the electric slide type of thing. I was like, 'OK, she obviously wants us to jam along to this and create a dance,'"" Alexis said. ""So I just went ahead and did it.""



Barthell and Alexis posted their dance video on Instagram and Twitter, using the hashtag #BeforeILetGoChallenge. The pair said they created the movement.



Their moves gained thousands of views over the next couple of days and inspired others to participate in the challenge. Eventually their video captured the attention of Queen B herself.



""Beyoncé has 127 million followers. Never in this world would I have thought she would even like dare see a video that I posted,"" Alexis said.



On Monday, Beyoncé shared videos of the dance challenge on her Instagram story. The singer spotlighted the Orlando dancers first.



""She doesn't post on her story at all, so for us to be on it period is mind blowing,"" Barthell said.



The dancers said their phones started blowing up with notifications after the singer shared their video.



""As soon as I checked, my phone was going 'buzz, buzz, buzz' nonstop and I almost fainted,"" Alexis said. ""It was crazy. She literally posted us and acknowledged it. It was crazy.""



Now thousands of people are sharing their videos of the challenge on social media. Barthell and Alexis said many people are following their choreography.



The dancers said Beyoncé is their inspiration, adding they're still in shock and grateful for the singer's support.



""She has no idea how much this has impacted me. I just want to follow my dreams even more,"" Alexis said.



""It inspired me to work even harder. Now I just really want to inspire, like I'm being inspired right now,"" Barthell said.

CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill. (AP) - The body of the missing Crystal Lake 5-year-old, Andrew “AJ” Freund, has been found, according to a source close to the case the Chicago Tribune reports.

The FBI and police in the Chicago suburb of Crystal Lake are planning a news conference as they search for a 5-year-old boy who has been missing for nearly a week.

The Crystal Lake Police Department says the news conference will take place at 1 p.m. on Wednesday at City Hall. The agencies have been searching for Andrew “AJ” Freund since his parents reported him missing last Thursday. The couple said they saw him at bedtime the night before and couldn’t find him in the morning.

Police searched for AJ in a park on Tuesday and said they planned to use sonar to search ponds in the community, which is about 50 miles northwest of Chicago.",https://www.wfla.com/national/mother-of-missing-illinois-5-year-old-not-talking-to-police/1950001084,2019-04-24T17:20:50Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

792,Couple travel across country learning to live off the land,"LAKELAND — Benny Glass and Jessie Lane have found harmony in a patch of unspoiled land set amidst north Lakeland’s suburban sprawl.

Glassroots farm consists of neat, parallel rows of everything that grows under the sun: garlands of cherry tomatoes, tender lettuces, bulbous eggplant, bok choy, carrots and a whole lot more, including esoterics like kohlrabi, luffa gourd and daikon radish.

Central Florida is rife with Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) operations delivering weekly baskets of fresh produce to paying members who prefer personal contact with farmers, many of whom use organic methods or shun genetically modified organisms.

Glass and Lane are no different, except that they also belong to a global cultural and educational group called Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms, or WWOOF.

WWOOFers pay an annual $45 membership fee ($65 for couples) giving them free range to test their mettle in an agrarian setting just about anywhere on the planet — 132 countries at last count.

The program pairs adventurous, outdoors types with farmers who use organic methods. WWOOFers provide labor in exchange for room and board. They can stay a day or two, or a week or more at any one location, depending on the host. The program is open to anyone 18 and older.

Glass and Lane, who are engaged to be married, learned the ins and outs of organic farming while traipsing across the country for nearly a year, visiting a variety of WWOOF operations. Some jobs offered additional learning opportunities, such as running a bed and breakfast and building a treehouse in Santa Cruz, California.

They tended to fields of flowers on Vashon Island near Seattle; worked a llama rescue sanctuary near Austin, Texas; learned the art of making maple syrup in Kentucky.

“It was the oddest mix of learning and vacationing,” said Glass, 35.

“We learned a lot of skills,” said Lane, 39. “If there’s ever a zombie apocalypse I can spin yarn and make flour from sweet potatoes.”

From the start it was Lane’s idea to hit the road to soak up knowledge of growing healthful food using natural and organic methods. A former restaurant server and bartender, the Lakeland native suffered a stroke while visiting a friend in Wauchula on Christmas Eve 2014. Her initial recovery required two months at Tampa General Hospital.

It was many more months before Lane overcame her paralysis, and even now isn’t 100%. But the episode triggered the desire for a new lifestyle, and career. Farming seemed appealing, and therapeutic.

Glass too was seeking change. He’d given up his job as caretaker of Circle B Bar Reserve, a county-managed nature park on Lake Hancock, to assist in Lane’s rehabilitation. To make ends meet he worked odd jobs and eventually moved into land surveying and computer-aided drafting.

A Tampa native who grew up in Brandon, Glass scrimped on expenses and saved. The couple sold their two cars and purchased a van, which they converted for their itinerant lifestyle. In March 2017 they headed out on a 10-month adventure.

WWOOFing doesn’t pay a salary or stipend, so Glass took side jobs, everything from cutting timber to mucking horse stables.

Traveling between farms they did some sightseeing, slept in their van, avoided excess pleasures to stretch dollars. “We ate a lot of beans,” Lane said. “There was a lot of sacrifice.”

Back at home, the couple worked on a plan for putting their newly acquired skills to work. Glass returned to surveying for a year while Lane sought out land to lease. They settled on a 4-acre parcel owned by Patricia Poore with more than enough room to make their dream come true.

Walking along the immaculate rows of her garden, Lane describes the subterranean landscape that’s crucial to natural, or organic, farming.

Above the topsoil is a layer of hay, which is covered in cardboard, then topped with 4 inches of mulch, all to inhibit weeds and contain moisture.

“We call it lasagna layering,” Lane said. “We’ll never have to till this again,” as additional tilling increases erosion, allowing essential nutrients to blow in the wind.

To grow healthy stalks of Brussels sprouts, kale, collards, heirloom tomatoes and more, Glassroots Farm shuns chemical pesticides in favor of biological pest control. That includes introducing insects like ladybugs, praying mantis and predatory nematodes to feed on harmful insects.

It’s a method of farming called permaculture that’s “about healing the land,” Lane said. “We study the land first and the environmental patterns before we come up with a plan.”

That plan includes mushroom farming, and eventually adding a fruit orchard and fields of flowers for fresh bouquets. Glass and Lane are negotiating terms to purchase the 4-acre parcel that includes two houses and a barn. They intend to operate a bed and breakfast, hold workshops and host fellow WWOOFers.

“We want to be an outreach to the community,” Glass said, “to get kids out here and get their hands dirty. I see it as more than a farm.”

793,"Couple slings dirt, swaps vows in Astatula mud pit","ASTATULA — Marcus ""Porkchop"" Swafford has been playing in the mud as long as he can remember. He's a mudder. His bride, Lottie, had an early acquaintance with mudding but did not get heavily into the sport until she started dating Swafford.

""We met online. Then we started dating and fell in love,"" Swafford said. ""Our first date, I took her to a mud race in Auburndale.""

That was four years ago, almost to the day, before their Saturday wedding at the Astatula mud pit, more properly known as Central Florida Motor Sports Park.

The two live in Orlando, but their unofficial home away from home is with Lottie's sister and brother-in-law, Del and Sheila Gray, south of Clermont. And that makes Astatula their local mud pit.

Lottie, formerly Lottie Kilmer, had the idea to hold the ceremony there.

""I saw a photo on Pinterest,"" she said. ""I get a lot of my ideas from Pinterest.""

""I'm going to trash my dress,"" she added.

And she did.

The ""church"" on Saturday was a flatbed towed into the wet, sloshy pit. The wedding arch, created by family members, was made of split logs, bark still attached, and was dressed on-site by the bride's sister.

The carriage that the bride arrived on was an extra tall lime-green swamp buggy named Lime Time. The ""horses"" that carried the groom and groomsmen were ATVs.

The first dance was on the flatbed, conveniently towed back to the covered pavilion, instead of a dance floor to celebrate on, with the bulk of the party headed to the mud pit.

Meghann Russell of Tampa, the notary who performed the ceremony, is a longtime friend of both the bride and groom. She wasn't surprised when she learned the wedding would be in a mud pit.

""It fits them,"" Russell said. ""I was surprised when she told me she was wearing a dress, but she pulled it off.""

In an informal survey of wedding guests, the only one to have any knowledge of any prior mud pit weddings was Jerry Copeland.

""They had one at the Redneck Yacht Club (Punta Gorda) years ago,"" he said.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190424/couple-slings-dirt-swaps-vows-in-astatula-mud-pit?rssfeed=true,2019-04-24T10:25:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
794,Vista Royale couple trying to raise $3 million to buy golf courses for the community,"INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — Some residents in Vista Royale are banking on raising $3 million by the end of July to purchase the golf courses in the southern Indian River County community.

""We've got to do something,"" said Dennis Sampson, a retiree from Pennsylvania.

""I've talked with a Realtor. I'm told if the golf courses go away, it would have an effect on our property values.""

From 2010:Should Vista Royale condo owners buy gold course?

From 2012: Dispute over Vista Royale golf course headed to court

The $3 million is the negotiated price Sampson and his wife, Luann Sampson, has on the table with the current owners of the three nine-hole courses in the community. Vista Golf LLC is the corporation that owns the courses, Vista Royale Golf and Country Club.

Buy Photo Dennis Sampson stops to talk to his wife Luann Sampson as his friends tee off from the second hole of the red course on Monday, April 22, 2019, at Vista Royale in Indian River County. The couple are trying to purchase the three 9-hole golf courses in the Vista Royale community where they live. ""We're selling golf packages, there's three different golf packages,"" Luann Sampson said. ""We want people to come alongside and buy in so they can rehab the golf course."" (Photo: ERIC HASERT/TCPALM)

""We're all in agreement that it would be in the best interest of the residents to own the courses,"" said Vero Beach attorney Charles Sullivan Jr., managing partner of Vista Golf LLC. ""It makes sense.""

Sullivan described his family's ownership of the courses as a reluctant arrangement from more than a decade ago. The family had a mortgage on the property, and was forced to purchase the first mortgage on the land when the primary owner dropped out following the 2004 hurricane season.

Dennis, and his wife Luann Sampson are trying to purchase the three nine-hole golf courses in the Vista Royale community where they reside. ""Last April, when this course was shut down, we decided we had to do something,"" Sampson said. ""So then we set up a corporation, we're rallying the community members together to buy the golf course and manage it, and save our community property value."" The red course has since reopened. (Photo: ERIC HASERT/TCPALM)

Sullivan said the courses aren't a moneymaker, but it's a viable amenity for the residents to have.

The Sampsons are seeking a pledge deadline for the purchase by the end of April. They need the money by July 31. If sold, the courses would become the property of the couple's corporation, Vero Beach Golf Club and Resort.

About the plan

Proposal: Vero Beach Golf Club and Resort

On the web: verobeachgolfclub.com

Phone: 570-974-1517

Details: They have a 100-day renovation plan, which includes new irrigation, drainage, maintenance equipment and remodeling for the building and for the courses, that would launch in the fall.

If purchased: Once the purchase is made, the courses would be offered to the homeowners associations that comprise Vista Royale to operate jointly, the Sampsons said.

If plan fails: If the plan falls short of the $3 million needed, all money given will be refunded by Aug. 31.

The Florida Man is a bit of an enigma. He is the frayed fabric of a worn tobacco ring in his left back pocket. He lives in the breeze that goes through your hair while doing donuts on an ATV. He is the slight echo in the air when someone says, ""Hey, watch'is!"" He is Florida, and Florida is him. Do not confuse him with your average male resident of Florida: Florida Man is a brand.Every day there is a story that involves one of them shooting something or screaming incomprehensible babble in a Natural Light addled rage before getting arrested.

Organ Builders, gives tour last week for Patricia Flowers, dean of the FSU College of Music, donor Charles Rockwood, and Iain Quinn, assistant professor of organ, at his Tacoma, Washington location where the Rockwood Organ will be built. (Photo: Jayme Agee/Special to the Democrat)

Professors Charles and Persis Rockwood began their careers at Florida State University in 1960. Persis taught marketing and management, before retiring in 1989. Charles taught economics until he followed suit in 1991.

Throughout their careers, they have been passionate about promoting the university’s mission beyond their respective academic areas.

Now, they are advancing that interest in a big way, with a new $2.2-million gift to build a state-of-the-art pipe organ specifically designed for FSU’s iconic Opperman Music Hall.

The handmade Rockwood Organ at the College of Music will be among the finest in the nation — adding prestige to its organ and sacred music programs, as well as the college, the university said this week in announcing the gift.

The Rockwood’s gift will be acknowledged during a special recital at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at Opperman. Featured will be Iain Quinn, organist, musicologist, composer and assistant professor of organ at FSU, who is working with the Rockwood’s on their vision.

The recital is free and open to the public.

The Rockwood’s latest philanthropic gift brings a total of $5-million in donations to the university.

“We are delighted to be able to make this gift,” Charles Rockwood said. “We continue to be impressed by the College of Music and hope this organ will inspire students and patrons well beyond our years. We believe this investment serves as a fitting legacy for our commitment to Florida State and supports the College of Music’s strong tradition of exceptional musicianship.”

Persis Rockwood is considered a trailblazer at FSU. She was the first woman promoted to full professor of marketing in 1973. She also chaired a university committee that worked to create a policy on gender equity in faculty salaries.

She was inducted into the College of Business Faculty Hall of Fame in 2018.

The couple have established a $1-million endowment for music scholarships at the College of Music, and have a named parterre in Ruby Diamond Concert Hall, said Jayme Agee, director of development for the College of Music.

They also have established a $1-million endowment for doctoral students in the Economics Department and have given significant financial support to Legacy Hall at the College of Business.

Installation planned for 2025

The Rockwood Organ will be built by Paul Fritts & Company Organ Builders, a Tacoma, Washington firm recognized as one of the country’s premier organ specialists.

Last week, Charles Rockwood, along with Patricia Flowers, dean of the College of Music and Quinn visited the Fritts operation.

The company has a four-year waiting list, meaning the two-year construction period will begin in 2023, with installation at Opperman planned sometime in 2025.

The company recently built a four-story pipe organ weighing 20 tons and featuring 5,000 pipes in the nearly 150-year-old Roman Catholic church on the campus of the University of Notre Dame.

“We are deeply grateful to Charles and Persis Rockwood for their generous legacy of giving to Florida State,” Flowers said. “Their gift of $2.2 million to purchase a custom-built pipe organ for Opperman Music Hall is a bold contribution that will have a lasting impact for generations of students.

Quinn said the custom-built organ will be a “jewel in the university’s crown.”

“The organs built by Paul Fritts are known for their exquisite tonal qualities and highly sensitive touch, which enables organists to achieve superior results,” Quinn said. “The new Rockwood Organ will elevate both the learning experience for students and the visibility of FSU’s organ program across the country.""

797,Ten takeaways from Florida State's Garnet and Gold Spring Game,"CLOSE The Seminoles held their final practice before Saturday’s Spring Game Thursday morning. Curt Weiler, Tallahassee Democrat

Florida State coach Willie Taggart wants his offense to go fast.

The 27,901 fans at Doak Campbell Stadium Saturday were also hoping to see the offense go at the Garnet and Gold Spring Game.

The Gold team won the game 27-21, but the most impressive part of the game was how fluid the offenses looked.

The two teams combined to run 96 plays in the first half before it went to a running clock with no tackling in the second half. The Gold team ran 46 plays despite having three plays go for more than 50 yards. The Garnet team ran 50 plays.

The combination of being in the second year of an up-tempo offense and having an offensive coordinator like Kendal Briles clearly made an impact this spring.

It was a significant uptick from the pace that FSU ran last fall and night-and-day from the 2017 offense. The offense was constantly snapping the ball with more than 20 seconds left on the play clock.

Quarterbacks play well

Redshirt sophomore James Blackman and redshirt freshman Jordan Travis both had exceptional days.

Blackman completed 20 of his 32 passes for 355 yards in the first half. He had touchdowns of 50 and 80 yards and made quick decisions at the line. He finished 23-37 for 415 yards and three touchdowns.

Travis didn't throw a touchdown in the first half, but did complete 22 of his 28 passes for 241 yards. He also made quick decisions and used his legs to get out of a couple of tight situations.

It was an impressive showing from both.

Freshmen defenders

True freshman linebacker Jaleel McRae and safety Akeem Dent both built on strong springs with impressive performances in the spring game.

McRae led the Garnet defense with seven tackles in the first half. He also batted multiple passes. He finished with a team-high 11 tackles.

Dent had five tackles, a pass break-up, and a fumble recovery. He finished with eight tackles and three pass break-ups.

Both players were all over the field making plays for the defense and showed why they're both going to be competing for starting jobs when the fall comes.

Redshirt freshman linebacker Amari Gainer was also all over the field at the star position. He had a game-high 13 tackles for the Gold team to go along with a tackle for loss and a sack.

Scary Terry

Wide receiver Tamorrion Terry picked up right where he left off last season with a 50-yard touchdown five minutes into the game.

Terry looked fast and physical once again, and could have had multiple touchdowns if not for an overthrow and a drop.

He finished with five catches for 77 yards and a touchdown on 12 targets. He's clearly emerged as the No. 1 target for Blackman.

Laborn back

FSU running back Khalan Laborn hadn't seen game action since he dislocated his knee cap returning a kickoff the second game of the 2018 season against Samford.

He looked like he hadn't missed a beat. Laborn looked slippery and explosive when he got the chance to play.

He finished the first half with six carries for 30 yards. He finished the game with 55 yards.

Helton shines

The most productive wide receiver of the day was sophomore Keyshawn Helton.

Helton had seven catches for 145 yards in the first half and finished with 157 yards in the game. He didn't have a touchdown, but did have a 72-yard reception where he made it to the end zone. It was called back a short way after a block in the back call.

Helton was able to consistently get open all over the field, particularly over the middle. He's set to be a big factor in the FSU offense moving forward.

Offensive line improved

FSU's offensive line was abysmal in 2018 and is a major concern heading into 2019.

The offensive lines combined to give up five sacks in the first half, but both teams did have their moments. The Garnet offensive line was able to open a couple holes that led to two touchdowns by running back Cam Akers in the first half.

It wasn't perfect with defenders still finding their way into the backfield a little too regularly, but it was a step up from the 2018 season.

Redshirt freshman wide receivers

Wide receivers Jordan Young and Warren Thompson both had good days.

Thompson had a couple of tough passes go right off his finger tips as he was diving for them, but made an 80-yard touchdown grab where he beat the corner and caused him to fall down before outrunning the rest of the defense to the end zone.

Young had four receptions in the game and finished with 67 yards and a 32-yard touchdown. He looked very explosive and shifty with the ball in his hands.

Marvin Wilson is still unblockable

FSU defensive tackle Marvin Wilson has been a star this spring and that continued in the spring game.

Wilson got into the backfield quite often and seemed to do it with ease. He was violent with his hands and quick off the ball.

He finished the game with five tackles, two sacks, and 2.5 tackles for loss.

Overall offensive improvement

Overall it was a very positive showing from a FSU offense that didn't have a lot of positives in 2018, including the spring game.

It was also a significantly more disciplined showing with only X total penalties in the game.

The offense was able to run the tempo well, Blackman looked in control of the offense, and the players were able to get lined up.

There's still plenty of work to be done, but the scrimmage was proof that the offense is definitely heading in the right direction.

799,Get away this summer in a floating house built by this Florida couple,"Florida real estate couple challenges traditional housing options by giving Florida homeowners oceanside views with their floating houses.

Tiny houses hit a wave of popularity with TV shows like Tiny House, Big Living, but for one Florida couple, they’re putting a Sunshine State twist on the trend by building petite houses that can float.



Warren and Cynthia Billings were recently featured on HGTV’s Tiny House Hunters and have built and sold four of their homes and have two more under construction.



The couple went viral with more than 47,000 hits on Facebook after sharing photos of the construction of their first bungalow -- and that’s how Floating Bungalows became a thing, Coastal Living reports.



Each of their homes is about 550 square feet with hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, flush toilets and an outdoor deck.





Interested in living the coastal life? You can purchase a tiny, floating home for around $225,000.



“We refused to compromise on style, luxury, and beauty,” the Billings recall on their website. “After some time, and lots of thought, it became clear what we were looking for -- the ability to live on the water; a small home with virtually no upkeep, and an affordable joyful lifestyle that could be sustained by working part-time.”

802,12-year-old Umatilla inventor hopes to save lives,"UMATILLA — A Umatilla Middle School student won first place at the state science fair Mar. 28, and since then she’s been promoting her potentially life-saving project in hopes of getting a patent.

Seventh-grader Alexandra “Lexie” Clow won $750 in prize money after her project, called the pediatric heat stroke prevention device, earned her a spot in the international BroadCom competition in D.C. She’s also won awards at the Lockheed Martin Science Challenge in Orlando, netting her an additional $400.

“I haven’t spent a cent of the money I’ve won,” Lexie said. “I want to put it all toward the patent.”

The patent would protect the core mechanics of her device, a car seat designed to alert people when a baby has been left in a hot car, as she continues to promote and develop it.

Lexie and her family decided a couple months ago to pursue the patent as she prepared to go to the state science fair for her second year of competition.

“We thought, hey, let’s help her get a patent on this,” her father, Rick Clow said. “It’s not really a big deal.”

As they came to find out, it was a bigger deal than expected.

Many people would think the patent process is inexpensive and simple, Lexie’s father, Rick Clow, said. But since its inception, the U.S. patent office has become the domain of lawyers more than the average person.

Companies have lawyers to handle the process, but individuals have to seek out specialized attorneys.

In the meantime, the family has registered Lexie's project as patent pending, which Clow said was a simple and accessible first step.

To get the rest of the way through, the family has started a GoFundMe campaign describing the project and asking for $15,000 to navigate the patent process.

Currently, the GoFundMe is sitting at $1,025. One $100 donation came from the Lake County Sheriff’s Office, which also gave Lexie a signal boost for her project after she won the science fair.

Lexie hopes to secure the patent prior to the international science fair in October, where it will go before an international audience.

She also wants the patent so she can take the device, aimed at reducing infant mortality, to the next level of development. Currently, the device works with a mostly wired system and a few radio frequency transmitters.

It's an independently powered car seat that gets hooked into a car's electronics in order to turn on the lights and honk the horn of the car when it detects the weight of a baby and heat around 104 degrees Fahrenheit. It activates cooling fans to increase a baby's chances of surviving and the seat also has bright blue LEDs on the side to draw the eye straight toward the seat.

In the future, Lexie said she hopes it can be developed as an accessory to smarter cars, with an app to alert parents who are walking away from their car without their child because, yes, it happens.

Ideally, it would even be a part of the car, rather than a standalone seat, she said.

Lexie said her goal was to keep the technology affordable. She used cheap, easily accessible components so it could be replicated for just a few hundred dollars in the interest of saving lives.

""I want to fix something that's a problem, locally, for us,"" Lexie said. When she found out Florida had the second most pediatric heat stroke deaths in the US, she decided it was a preventable problem and she wanted to solve it.

58 children died of heat stroke in 2018, she said, one of which occurred in Sanford. Lexie thinks she can help lower that number.

808,PSJ commissioners hear options on sewer system,"During a Monday workshop Port St. Joe commissioners received the information they have long sought from the owner of the sewer system serving Gulf Aire in St. Joe Beach.

They have up to three months to make a decision on whether to purchase the system or walk away from a deal discussed on and off for at least six years.

The owner of the system, Frank Seifert, provided two possible options after an approach to the city to buy the system five years ago failed to advance beyond offer.

The second of those proposals Monday was an updated version of that initial offer; the city would pay $850,000 outright to purchase the entire system.

The other proposal, one that has only surfaced in recent months, seemed the most attractive to commissioners, however.

That would have the city assuming treatment of all effluent out of the system at a set price, with Seifert’s company maintaining the billing.

Either option would have to be approved by the Public Service Commission due to changes either would bring in rate structure, said Seifert’s attorney Gene Adams.

Seifert noted that if the city were to favor assuming treatment responsibilities only, any approval from the PSC could take up to two years.

But, commissioners seemed completely disinterested in purchasing the system in its entirety.

The idea has been floated for years, with Seifert at one time offering the system to the city for $900,000.

He contended Monday commissioners had cost taxpayers dollars in the seven figures by not accepting the deal basing his estimation on the value of the system’s infrastructure and lost revenue.

The current price Seifert is asking is over $1.2 million, with the Board of County Commissioners providing the city $400,000 in the form of RESTORE Act funds.

Seifert provided a report from an independent engineer hired by Florida Rural Water who inspected the system and issued a report last updated two years ago.

Corrections and deficiencies cited in the report were addressed, he added, including overhauls of two of the system’s three lift stations, though there is no report on the state of the plant since 2017, and certainly not after Hurricane Michael.

The valuation provided in the report put the system’s value at $1.5 million with the cost of replacing the system from scratch at $2.5 million.

Seifert said he currently had 255 customers with two more due to be online soon after Hurricane Michael destroyed their homes.

The system has a capacity for more than 400 customers.

The county would like to eliminate the plant, located near the coast, for aesthetic and economic reasons.

With the wastewater lagoons gone and plant offline, there would be over three acres for development of up to 31 single-family dwellings, building the tax base.

“There is a value in getting rid of that lagoon,” said City Commissioner David Ashbrook, noting the odious smells coming from the plant many times of the year.

“I would love to see it go away and it gets us some customers.”

A key question for commissioners is whether those customers bolster or erode utility revenue.

The proposal from Seifert is to pay the city $5.28 per 1,000 gallons; that is a wholesale price for the city, which the city does not actually have within its rate structure.

The city charges $7.28 per 1,000 gallons, on top of a $33.39 base rate, for residential customers.

With Barrier Dunes on St. Joseph Peninsula, the city has an arrangement to that proposed by Seifert.

The major difference is city charges consumers in Barrier Dunes the base rate and per 1,000-gallon fee all residential customers pay.

The proposal from Seifert includes no base rate for those customers coming over from Gulf Aire, which, City Manager Jim Anderson noted, could open the city for legal action from property owners in Barrier Dunes.

Last year, the Gulf Aire system handled more than 13 million gallons of wastewater, Seifert said.

“Accepting that much effluent is going to increase the chemical costs for the city,” Ashbrook said. “How much (revenue) is it going to generate for the city and how much will it cost?”

Another question looming over a decision is whether or not the city would have to install a new lift station, which is not yet clear in either a practical or financial sense.

The county’s RESTORE funds were originally to help finance purchase of the system; county commissioners would have to determine if they would allow the money to be used on a lift station.

City Commissioner Scott Hoffman asked if Seifert could offer commissioners time to make a counteroffer.

As the report provided commissioners was already two years old, Hoffman also asked about receiving the most recent inspection reports from Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

Seifert said another party was interested in purchasing the system, though he was vague about the urgency.

He agreed to Hoffman’s request to wait at allow the city at least three months to make a decision.

Hoffman noted some of his constituents were suggesting there was a press on to finalize a deal before next month’s municipal election.

More importantly, however, Hoffman said commissioners needed time to digest a considerable amount of information in making an important decision with public money.

“We need to do our research, we need to do a lot of research,” Hoffman said. “And it won’t be something that will be done in a couple of weeks.”",https://www.starfl.com/news/20190425/psj-commissioners-hear-options-on-sewer-system?rssfeed=true,2019-04-25T23:37:40Z,"The Star, Port St. Joe",Couple,"101 W Hwy 98, Port St Joe, FL 32456, USA",FL,32456
810,Armed teachers will have a truly awesome responsibility,"No matter how you feel about arming teachers, you can’t read the legislation implementing recommendations of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission without an overwhelming sense of sadness.

So this is what we’ve come to. Guns in the public schools. The ultimate extreme step to be ready for the unspeakable horror, the ghastly possibility no one wants to think about — but which became so real on Feb. 14, 2018.

Florida legislators often have to try logical, sensible, smart solutions for behavior that is illogical, senseless and stupid. For 30 years, they’ve been trying, with limited success, to deter drunk driving and domestic violence with prevention, education and punishment.

Every little bit helps, and they can’t stop trying, but you can’t prevent crazy behavior with sane, orderly solutions. Not all of it, anyway.

Bill Cotterell (Photo: Democrat files)

The trouble with guns, though, is that you’ve got to get it right every time. One mistake — and no matter how much training and preparation is required, humans will make mistakes — and somebody winds up dead or maimed for life.

Sometimes I think the movies and TV have given us a warped idea of our own competency.

You know what I’d do if one of those shootings started at the mall, or a movie theater or a school when I was there? I’d get my gun and drop that guy like a bad habit, that’s what I’d do. Yeah, right. It’s easy to imagine ourselves like Clint Eastwood in “Dirty Harry” or Charles Bronson in “Death Wish,” springing into bold, heroic action in an emergency.

Or maybe we’d be like the smiling, confident Sheriff Andy Taylor in Mayberry, calmly defusing a bad situation with a smile and a firm command. It’s more likely Deputy Barney Fife, though, fumbling in his shirt pocket for that lone bullet and dropping his revolver a couple times.

Yet, at the same time, could the murderous rampage in Broward County last year — or at Columbine, Sandy Hook or that movie theater in Aurora, Colo. — have been any worse if (as the NRA puts it) “a good guy with a gun” had been present? Maybe. As with Florida’s 2005 “Stand Your Ground” law, there’s the danger of innocent bystanders getting hit by that good guy.

And it’s probably not going to stop the kind of evil, insane person who would want to kill people. If knowledge that a teacher is armed deters one attack, that’s great, but it’s also likely that a potential gunman would find out which teachers are the designated “guardians” and shoot them first, or avoid that part of the building.

But knowing nobody in there can shoot back certainly doesn’t deter a heavily armed lunatic.

The teacher unions and a large number of students, including some from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, urged legislators not to authorize the arming of teachers. The Senate passed the bill (which does a whole lot more than that) by a vote of 22-17, with only one Republican joining the Democrats in voting against it.

Passage in the House during the final days of the 2019 legislative session is a virtual certainty. Gov. Ron DeSantis is on board. This is going to happen.

But that doesn’t mean every teacher will be carrying a side arm. Only volunteers in counties that opt into the year-old guardian program, who go through thorough training with their county sheriffs’ offices, will be armed.

Then we can only hope they get it right, every time.

So what do you think will happen first: A teacher hears a rumor of a gunman on campus and shoots some kid carrying a trombone case to band class, because it sure looked like a gun for a second or two? Or a real killer shows up with an AR-15, and that same teacher prevents another horror story?

They're vying for sales to keep them alive for another episode of the reality-show competition, which is hosted by Florence, a celebrity chef and longtime Food Network star.

""I can't thank the people of Fort Myers enough for rolling out the red carpet for us,"" Florence said during his visit to Fort Myers Brewing Co. Wednesday afternoon, where three of the competing trucks had set up.

""The turnout we've seen here is incredible. This is our 10th season and this is maybe the best crowd we've ever seen.""

So, where are the trucks today?

It's not crystal clear.

Lisa Sbuttoni, president and CEO of the River District Alliance, said several of the show's trucks will be serving on First Street in downtown Fort Myers from ""mid-morning through the afternoon."" They include: Rolling Indulgence, Frank n Slides, Madea Made,

Brunch Babes and NOLA Creations 504.

Elsewhere downtown, Millennial Brewing Co. has a confirmed event with Rolling Indulgence today, while Sidney & Berne Davis Arts Center is hosting an event with Brunch Babes per its Facebook page.

The local Jonesez BBQ food truck has an event posted with Madea Made at the corner of Crystal Drive and Metro Parkway in south Fort Myers. NOLA Creations 504 is scheduled to return to Fort Myers Brewing Co. where it also served Wednesday. Frank n Slides posted on Facebook that it would return to Old Soul Brewing sometime today.

But the funny thing about show biz? All of this is subject to change.

Wednesday's events were delayed, some by a couple hours, some by four or more, due to ""competitiony things"" as Fort Myers Brewing's owner Jen Gratz-Whyte put it.

Today will likely be no different. So bring patience — and cash, which is the only currency the competing trucks deal in.

812,'Navigators' steers through the perils of online romance | Theater review,"Alejandra Gutierrez and Mattie Ward play a couple who meets online in Tallahassee Hispanic Theater's production of ""Navigators."" (Photo: Curt Blair)

Planning to indulge in a colorful cocktail or two this weekend? Stick to beer or wine if you're going to catch the American premiere of the play ""Navigators"" in Railroad Square.

The anxiety you will feel about cocktails after seeing this show may be similar to how you felt about showers after watching Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho.""

Written by screenwriter and playwright Toni Cabre in Spanish, ""Navigators"" is being performed by the Tallahassee Hispanic Theater Company using an English translation.

The two characters, Patricia (Alejandra Gutierrez) and Robert (Mattie Ward), are called navigators because they surf the web looking for action. They find each other and begin talking. I mean, typing.

The facts they initially reveal to each other through Facebook Messenger are lies. When they meet in person and discover the extent of their fabrications, Patricia shrugs off the deception and persuades Robert that invented lives are more exciting than real ones. She proposes they assume everything between them is made up, and they proceed to make their lies a game — fueled by lots of sex and specially concocted cocktails.

Ward and Gutierrez provide a sharp contrast to each other in Robert and Patricia's game of ""let's pretend."" Ward captures a sense of desperation in Robert. He responds to Patricia like an eager puppy would, growing more manic as he wishes he could trade their invented moments for a real and honest relationship.

Wary of expressing her true feelings, Gutierrez as Patricia projects a nuanced strength, making us believe she is in control of both Robert and herself, while she attempts to retain the protective shell she has created. Finally, even she is rattled by events ratcheting out of control.

Director Kevin Carr uses all the theatrical elements at his disposal to create the sense of distance and alienation of lives lived on the internet, set against the possibilities of real social connection. The pop music used as scene interludes matches the moods created by the actors.

""Navigators"" succeeds in making us laugh about the extreme complications that can result when we meet online, and at the same time, causes us to think about the blurring of reality the internet facilitates.

The show is both a funny and timely; audiences in 2019 are even more comfortable with the idea of people meeting online than they were when the played debuted in 2000. And if you haven't tried surfing the web for this particular purpose, ""Navigators"" can guide you through these uncharted waters — especially the things not to do.

And try to avoid the cocktails.

IF YOU GO

What: ""Navigators"" presented by Tallahassee Hispanic Theater

When: 8 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, 2 and 8 p.m. Sunday

According to dozens of phone calls from Austin Harrouff to his family from jail, the 22-year-old charged with the face-biting murders of a married couple met and started a relationship behind bars with a mystery woman 10 years older than he.In many of the 80 calls made one week in January and obtained by WPBF 25 News, Harrouff talked about his upcoming trial for the deaths of John Stevens III and Michelle Mishcon.But Harrouff talked more at length to his parents and friends about a woman he became involved with while behind bars charged with the murders.“I guess I was just bored, I don't have a lot of friends in here,” Harrouff said in one call. “She shared the Bible and stuff with me and acted like she was saved.”Harrouff told one woman that although his mother disapproved of the relationship, it continued for eight months, but then he learned things about his girlfriend that he didn’t like.Eventually, he said, he broke it off.“I feel a lot better now that she's gone. I mean, in the beginning I was really happy and like, excited and stuff but as the months got on, it was just like…” Harrouff told his mother.Harrouff also said the woman had recently written him again, and it made him feel guilty.“She’s like ‘Is there another girl’? I'm like, where does she come up with this stuff? I'm alone in solitary confinement,” Harrouff said.His mother advised him not to feel badly and not to re-read the letter.Harrouff’s father, Wade Harrouff, told him he was better off, and recommended taking the former girlfriend’s name off his visitor’s list and adding his sister’s name instead.“I didn't want to believe it. I just hurt so bad and I felt betrayed,” Harrouff continued in another call.He also speculated that the woman could have been a spy for prosecutors and worried she’d show his letters to “the cops.”“I didn't tell her anything about the case, but I guess it’s kind of embarrassing. But I'm used to being embarrassed at this point,” he said.Harrouff’s attorneys plan an insanity defense. According to court records, a defense psychologist concluded Harrouff suffered from severe mental illness and believed he was half-man, half-dog when he attacked and killed Mishcon and Stevens in 2016.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/mystery-older-woman-romances-accused-killer-austin-harrouff-behind-bars/27260904,2019-04-24T23:25:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
814,Armed teachers will have a truly awesome responsibility | Bill Cotterell,"No matter how you feel about arming teachers, you can’t read the legislation implementing recommendations of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission without an overwhelming sense of sadness.

So this is what we’ve come to. Guns in the public schools. The ultimate extreme step to be ready for the unspeakable horror, the ghastly possibility no one wants to think about – but which became so real on Feb. 14, 2018.

Florida legislators often have to try logical, sensible, smart solutions for behavior that is illogical, senseless and stupid. For 30 years, they’ve been trying, with limited success, to deter drunk driving and domestic violence with prevention, education and punishment.

Every little bit helps, and they can’t stop trying, but you can’t prevent crazy behavior with sane, orderly solutions. Not all of it, anyway.

The trouble with guns, though, is that you’ve got to get it right every time. One mistake – and no matter how much training and preparation is required, humans will make mistakes – and somebody winds up dead or maimed for life.

Sometimes I think the movies and TV have given us a warped idea of our own competency.

You know what I’d do if one of those shootings started at the mall, or a movie theater or a school when I was there? I’d get my gun and drop that guy like a bad habit, that’s what I’d do. Yeah, right. It’s easy to imagine ourselves like Clint Eastwood in “Dirty Harry” or Charles Bronson in “Death Wish,” springing into bold, heroic action in an emergency.

Or maybe we’d be like the smiling, confident Sheriff Andy Taylor in Mayberry, calmly defusing a bad situation with a smile and a firm command. It’s more likely Deputy Barney Fife, though, fumbling in his shirt pocket for that lone bullet and dropping his revolver a couple times.

Yet, at the same time, could the murderous rampage in Broward County last year – or at Columbine, Sandy Hook or that movie theater in Aurora, Colo. – have been any worse if (as the NRA puts it) “a good guy with a gun” had been present? Maybe. As with Florida’s 2005 “Stand Your Ground” law, there’s the danger of innocent bystanders getting hit by that good guy.

And it’s probably not going to stop the kind of evil, insane person who would want to kill people. If knowledge that a teacher is armed deters one attack, that’s great, but it’s also likely that a potential gunman would find out which teachers are the designated “guardians” and shoot them first, or avoid that part of the building.

But knowing nobody in there can shoot back certainly doesn’t deter a heavily armed lunatic.

The teacher unions and a large number of students, including some from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, urged legislators not to authorize the arming of teachers. The Senate passed the bill (which does a whole lot more than that) by a vote of 22-17, with only one Republican joining the Democrats in voting against it.

Passage in the House during the final days of the 2019 legislative session is a virtual certainty. Gov. Ron DeSantis is on board. This is going to happen.

But that doesn’t mean every teacher will be carrying a side arm. Only volunteers in counties that opt into the year-old guardian program, who go through thorough training with their county sheriffs’ offices, will be armed.

Then we can only hope they get it right, every time.

So what do you think will happen first: A teacher hears a rumor of a gunman on campus and shoots some kid carrying a trombone case to band class, because it sure looked like a gun for a second or two? Or a real killer shows up with an AR-15, and that same teacher prevents another horror story?

817,We need more Lee County commissioners like Frank Mann: your say,"0424 Cartoon (Photo: Bruce Plante, Tulsa World)

Painful day

When Lee County Commissioner Frank Mann says, as he did April 17, ""It's a painful day,"" you can be sure it is just that for those of us in Lee County.

During the years that Mann has held elected offices here (I believe over 20), he has shown what his own special interests are – those of us who live or visit here and the land we walk on.

We badly need more community-dedicated representatives on our Board of County Commissioners as shown by their vote being for the mining issue April 17. Yes, it was a ""painful day"", with more to follow, thanks to their votes.

Betty Tobin. Fort Myers

Against mines

In regards the Lee mining article on April 18, it seems apparent from this and previous articles that many or most of the Lee County taxpayers that live in the vicinity of the mine sites being discussed are firmly against expansion of said sites. Can anyone blame them?

Still, the Lee County commissioners, with one exception, voted to ignore the citizens' wishes. Don't these silly taxpayers know that the commissioners know what's best for them and their communities? It would be interesting to know how close any commissioner lives to these mines.

Also, during the meeting, County Attorney Richard Wesch made a statement comparing the need to regulate mining with ""raising melons or potatoes."" Really? That's like comparing sitting in the last row during a symphony orchestra recital and being in the mosh pit at a heavy metal concert.

Wide concern

I'm sure many of your readers like me were horrified, repulsed and saddened by your April 18 article entitled ""Jurassic Swordfish"" reporting on the catch and eventual harpooning of 757.8 pound swordfish by a Cape Coral couple fishing in the Keys.

For years, the swordfish has been known to be overfished and thousand of square miles of the North Atlantic were declared off limits by the federal government. Other oceans apparently have not been so restricted, but for years there has been wide concern for the effect of overfishing of the swordfish.

I am a fisherman and enjoy a good catch on my fly rod, but it is all catch and release – my choice to return the fish to come back another day. I have great respect for many fisher friends who keep their catch that are in the legal limits, but this swordfish catch is different.

Legal or not, wouldn't it have been better for this trophy fish, a female with the potential for propagating millions of offspring, to have been released and returned to the wild?

Ed Stringer, Sanibel

Thank you

I am sending a heartfelt thank you to Lee County Commissioner Frank Mann for listening to the citizens in attendance on April 17.

Your vote was powerful and important because you represented the residents.

Sincerely and with deep appreciation.

Another example

I attended the Lee County commissioners meeting April 17 on lime rock mining in the DR/GR. I took a work day off as did many of the other constituents in attendance as this matter is of dire importance. After four hours of public comment a super majority was established by constituents for a no vote by the commissioners.

They voted 3-1 in favor of moving forward. Another example of Florida democracy in action.

818,Readers argue Nice Guys restaurant not Cape Coral's best — Ask JLB,"CLOSE Danger, Danger opened in late March in south Cape Coral. The restaurant is a collaboration from the owners of nearby Nice Guys and Nevermind. Kinfay Moroti, The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA

Is Nice Guys the best restaurant in Cape Coral? Two readers say no, but JLB stands behind the recent pick.

Back in March I ranked the best restaurants in Cape Coral. At the top of my list: a dark little hipster-ish bar called Nice Guys.

I had a feeling the pick might ruffle some feathers, but the first couple weeks all was quiet on the western Cape Coral front. Then these two emails hit my inbox. Read on for my response.

• Hard to imagine the criteria you are using if you put Nice Guys in Cape Coral at the top of your restaurant list. You have lost credibility with us. We were there once and couldn't wait to leave. ... This restaurant is not what we're looking for in the Cape. Please stop hyping it! — Pat M.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

• You Identified Nice Guys as the best restaurant in Cape Coral. Based on your glowing review, my friends and I decided to give it a try. We walked in, sat down, looked around and walked out, very disappointed! ... I hope visitors to Cape Coral do not think this is the best that Cape Coral has to offer as we do count on visitors for our economy! — Jean K.

As I told Pat and Jean (lovely name, by the way), I value their opinions even if I respectfully disagree with them.

My reasons for rating Nice Guys No. 1 have to do with its creativity and uniqueness. There are pinball machines and it is dark, yes, but the flavor combinations and the stunning range of cocktails are unlike anything any other restaurant is doing in Cape Coral.

Beyond food, I love that Nice Guys is a youth magnet. Cape Coral attracts plenty of older folks, plenty of retirees, but not nearly enough young people. I can't think of a single restaurant in all of Southwest Florida that is as naturally ""cool"" as Nice Guys is. It doesn't try to lure in young people. There are no gimmicks, no flashy happy-hour specials, just an ongoing lineup of interesting musicians, events and, yes, great food and drinks, too.

Nice Guys draws that young population over the bridge — in droves. I can't say that about any place else.

I love that it’s affordable and accessible to all (youth aside, I've seen plenty of Tommy Bahama-clad 60-somethings sipping IPAs at the bar).

That's what boosted Nice Guys to the top for me this year.

In all honesty, Point 57 (No. 2 on my list) is probably the better all-around restaurant, but I gave the nod to Nice Guys because it's unlike any other. I love honest-to-goodness creativity wherever I can find it, but in Cape Coral — which is often maligned as a haven for the elderly — it’s refreshing to find something that’s just plain different.

For husband-and-wife team Vassilios and Deborah Tsaganis, owners of Pastabilities & More in south Fort Myers since 2002, their restaurant doesn’t feel like work.

“It’s a passion for us,” said Deborah, who manages the front of the house while Vassilios runs the kitchen.

“We don’t look at it as work. Every day I wake up and I say: Today’s going to be a great day.""

That passion for the restaurant business has been going for more than two decades. Before the pair moved to Fort Myers, they owned The Quay on Duval Street in Key West for 13 years.

“That was a big restaurant,” Deborah said. “It was a very, very busy restaurant. Then we decided we wanted to downsize and relax a little bit, go more family-oriented.”

Pastabilities is located at 16541 San Carlos Boulevard in Fort Myers. (Photo: Kinfay Moroti, The News-Press USA Today Network-Florida)

Which is how the pair ended up in Fort Myers, a place, Deborah said, that’s a good blend of island life and city living.

“You don’t have to drive all the way to Miami to go shopping,” she said, “like we used to have to. Key West is beautiful, but sometimes you’d catch a little bit of island fever.”

The pair first took over Pastabilities in its previous location off San Carlos Boulevard in what is now the Walmart plaza. In 2010, they moved to their current location on San Carlos between Summerlin and Kelly roads.

Deborah, who is originally from Dublin, Ireland, is a staple in the restaurant, and she’s come to know her customers and their families over the years.

“I was just talking to one of my customers yesterday, and I asked how her granddaughter is doing. I remember her being in a highchair, and now she’s 17,"" Deorah said.

""The kids are growing up right in front of me. It’s a nice feeling. I remember one customer’s son having prom dinner here. There were about 20 of them. Now he’s a lawyer, and he’s married. Where did the years go? It just seems like yesterday when they were small.”

The restaurant’s customers come back for this warm, family-oriented hospitality — and for the food.

The menu is Italian-focused, though it also offers Mediterranean and continental dishes with an emphasis on seafood. Everything is made to order (which, Deborah points out, helps in accommodating people’s food allergies and intolerances).

Some of the most popular dishes include the snapper Cozumel with yellow tail snapper, Gulf shrimp, sea scallops, fresh basil, mushrooms and garlic in a Trebbiano white wine sauce. The seafood cioppino features more snapper and shrimp, sea scallops, clams and mussels in a spicy marina sauce. The snapper Grand Marnier is finished with orange slices and roasted almonds.

“It’s a beautiful dish,” Deborah said. “The sweetness reduces, and it’s not overpowering. It has a beautiful flavor, especially topped with the mandarin orange slices.”

The restaurant also make its own soups — lobster bisque, crab bisque, chicken Florentine, pasta fagioli — and desserts, plus Italian favorites such as lasagna, manicotti and stuffed shells.

Though Pastabilities is only open for dinner, the couple starts each day at 3 a.m.

“We go in early in the morning because we make everything there in the restaurant,” Deborah said.

“It’s time consuming, which is OK. We don’t like to rush things. We do everything with a lot of heart.""

820,"Miss Costa, a 12-foot great white shark, 'pings' again in Gulf of Mexico","The spring weather has been so nice in the Panhandle for the past few weeks that nobody wants to leave.

That goes for people, and it apparently goes for 1,668-pound great white sharks, too.

Miss Costa, the globally beloved female great white shark that ""pinged"" near the Big Bend area of the Gulf of Mexico on April 15, hasn't strayed far from the Gulf since then.

On Friday, Miss Costa pinged in our backyard again, this time at 9:51 a.m. Friday, well south of Port St. Joe in the Gulf. That is according to OCEARCH, the international great white shark research organization that is tracking her movements.

A ping is determined when the tagged shark's dorsal fin breaks the surface of the water and transmits a signal to a satellite overhead, according to OCEARCH's tracking system. The transmission then sends back an estimated geolocation.

John Kanaly, OCEARCH communications manager, said that in his experience, it's fairly common for white sharks to ping in the Gulf of Mexico between December and July.

""What she is doing is she's reinforcing some of the data we've collected in the past,"" Kanaly said. ""We do see that white sharks are in the Gulf for at least six months of the year. And the bulk of them come at this time, and most are on that west Florida slope.""

Miss Costa was on a more northwestern trajectory last week at the time of her Big Bend ping, spending a couple of days south of Panama City Beach, per her OCEARCH tracker.

On Twitter, where she has close to 16,000 followers, the people running Miss Costa's account sent out a message of love and appreciation for everyone following along on her journey.

""You all are making me blush,"" said her tweet posted Friday. ""I've had so many humans give me warm welcomes during my visit to the Gulf. Thank you.""

821,"New Phoenix Theatre announces fun new season in Fort Myers: 'Rocky Horror,' 'Full Monty,' etc.","CLOSE Here's a look at Southwest Florida's newest community theater. Located in south Fort Myers, New Phoenix Theatre opens Jan. 10 with 'Marvin's Room.' Charles Runnells, crunnells@news-press.com

Brenda Kensler’s been chatting with audiences at New Phoenix Theatre. And here’s what they’ve been telling the theater's co-founder: Lay off the cancer stuff, please.

So that’s just what the community theater is doing with its recently announced second season. Unlike the theater’s first season — with its cancer-themed plays “Marvin’s Room” and the upcoming “The Shadow Box” — this one’s packed with relative crowdpleasers and (almost) no life-threatening illnesses in sight.

Kensler chalks it up to getting to know the audiences at the new south Fort Myers theater. Many are residents of the nearby The Landings neighborhood, she says, and many are retirees who probably don’t want to hear about cancer and illness that much.

“We’re just trying to figure out what people want from our theater,” says Kensler, the theater's board president. “And mostly they want to have fun.”

New Phoenix opened Jan. 10 in the same McGregor Boulevard plaza as The Melting Pot and First Watch. The community theater debuted with the comedy “Marvin’s Room,” followed by “La Cage Aux Folles” in March and now the upcoming drama “The Shadow Box” (May 2-19) and the Neil Simon comedy “Rumors” (June 13-30).

Reaction to the drag-queen comedy “La Cage Aux Folles,” however, helped point the way to the theater’s funnier future, Kensler says. “‘La Cage’ blew everybody away. We were sold out almost every night. We had to bring in chairs some nights.”

Now New Phoenix is readying a second season that includes the campy sci-fi rock musical “The Rocky Horror Show,” the striptease comedy “The Full Monty,” the farce “Inspecting Carol” and actor Steve Martin’s recent Broadway comedy, “Meteor Shower.”

The new season mostly side-steps heavier fare like next month’s “The Shadow Box,” a 1977 drama about cancer patients who are visited by family and friends on the hospital grounds where they live.

Tickets are selling poorly for that one, Kensler admits. “But we’re learning. That’s only our third show.”

However, Kensler says that doesn’t mean they won’t challenge audiences, too, or try to win them over with something besides comedy. “We have to be true to ourselves, too.""

That’s where plays like next season’s “Lips Together, Teeth Apart” come in. The comedy-drama involves AIDS and two straight couples who spend a weekend in a gay community on New York’s Fire Island.

Kensler says she can’t wait to raise the curtain on that play and the rest of the theater's second season.

“I’m just excited about it,” she says. “I’m excited about the theater. I’m excited about the season. And I’m excited about the people who are coming to see our shows.”

823,Local players helping fuel Florida SouthWestern's baseball success this season,"CLOSE FSW has surged to the top 10 of NJCAA rankings behind contributions of Lee, Collier players Andrew Sodergren, andy.sodergren@naplesnews.com, 239-263-4731

When Drake Dobyanski was being recruited by new Florida SouthWestern baseball coach Ben Bizier last summer, he was told something that made a lasting impression.

“He told me he was going to come here, and he was going to build a monster,” the 2018 Gulf Coast High graduate said. “That caught my attention right away and here we are, more than halfway through the season, he stuck to his word, and we have built a monster here.”

The Buccaneers have their highest win total since the program resumed in 2016 with a 29-11 record through play Wednesday. The Bucs climbed to No. 10 in the latest NJCAA Division I poll.

Dobyanski is one of seven players from Collier and Lee counties to suit up for FSW this season, with several of those making key contributions.

Dobyanski is the team’s center fielder and leadoff hitter. Estero graduate Tommy Joseph started the season as a dual contributor, making five pitching appearances before settling into his role as the team’s No. 3 hitter and left fielder. Jesse Ferreira (Barron Collier), Joey Mugavero (Estero), Derek Rascher (Palmetto Ridge), and Robert Wegielnik (Cypress Lake) have all chipped in as members of the team’s quality pitching staff.

Ida Baker graduate CJ Schrowe, a pitcher, is being redshirted this year.

“There’s a conscious effort to recruit around here, but there also happens to be a lot of really good ballplayers around here,” Bizier said. “One of the things we want to do is educate people about what we’re doing around here, what we’re doing administration-wise, what we’re doing facility-wise, what we’re doing for the student-athletes. The experience they’re going to get here is much better than what they’re going to get somewhere else.”

The Buccaneers players were quick to give Bizier and his staff credit for helping the team realize its potential.

“One of the keys for us is every day, coming out here and working on something that helps us get better than the day before,” Joseph said. “We have a plan every day and every game for what we want to do, and we always try to strike first.”

Dobyanski agreed with Joseph, his former high school rival turned teammate.

“I feel like all the players are really good here, and he coaches us the right way,” he said. “Every day we come out here and we grind. We just get after it.”

Dobyanski, a freshman, said being familiar with so many players before setting foot on campus was a big help.

“Well at first, I knew a couple of the guys that were coming here but I didn’t realize how many local guys there were. There were a lot more than I thought there would be and it definitely helped me settle in a lot easier than if I didn’t know a bunch of the guys.”

Barron Collier graduate Jesse Ferreira leads the Buccaneers with 10 starts, going 2-1 with a 3.53 earned run average. (Photo: Submitted photo/FSW sports information)

Wegielnik had initially committed to Florida Southern, but is glad he switched to FSW. He said Bizier is a proven winner, and he’s brought that attitude to the Buccaneers.

“It all starts with the coaching change,” he said. “Everybody wants to get better, everybody wants to succeed and everyone’s doing their part. We all want to win when it comes down to it.”

Joseph is a prime example of doing whatever it takes to help the team. He started the year in the pitching rotation but as soon as some of the younger pitchers got up to speed, he was able to focus strictly on the outfield and his offense.

Estero graduate Joey Mugavero has been one of FSW's top relievers this season, pitching to a 1.88 ERA in 10 appearances with two saves. In 24 innings, he's allowed 24 hits with 8 walks and 23 strikeouts. (Photo: Submitted photo/FSW sports information)

“When I first came here, I was determined to do whatever it took to help the team win,” he said. “I was doing a little bit of both the beginning of the season. Now I’m able to focus on just hitting because our pitching staff has a variety of guys that can help the team win. Right now, I’m hitting but if they needed me to pitch again, I can come in and do that.”

Bizier said the goal coming into the season is the same as it’s been for any team he’s ever coached – win the conference championship. The ranking has given his program some nice publicity, but he admits it’s not something he or his team really focus on.

“We weren’t necessarily set on expectations other than we have high expectations,” Bizier said. “There wasn’t anything we thought of other than winning a conference championship. That’s the goal with every team that I coach – we want to win a conference championship and it starts and ends there. We’re on our way to try to do that and until we do, we haven’t really done anything in our players’ eyes.”

CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill. (AP) — Authorities on Wednesday dug up the body of a 5-year-old Illinois boy who was reported missing last week and charged his parents with murder and other counts.

The body, believed to be that of Andrew “AJ” Freund, was wrapped in plastic and buried in a shallow grave in a rural area of Woodstock, Crystal Lake police Chief James Black said at a news conference. Woodstock is about 50 miles northwest of Chicago and a few miles from the family’s home in Crystal Lake.

Black said investigators were led to the body after they interviewed the boy’s parents overnight and presented them with cellphone evidence.

The parents, Andrew Freund Sr. and JoAnn Cunningham, each face five counts of first-degree murder and other charges, including aggravated battery.

In a message intended for the slain boy, the chief said, “We know you are at peace playing in heaven’s playground and are happy you no longer have to suffer.”

Black said his efforts are underway to confirm that the body is AJ’s and that his department won’t be releasing further details in an effort to protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation.

Officers removed several items from the family home on Wednesday, including a shovel, mattress, paper bags and a plastic storage tub.

Authorities said the couple reported AJ missing on Thursday and told officers they had last seen him at bedtime the previous night.

Early on in their investigation, though, police said they didn’t believe the boy was abducted or that he had left the home on foot. They also said they were “focusing on the residence and the individuals that may have seen or had contact with AJ last,” and that Cunningham wasn’t cooperating with detectives.

On Tuesday, the department released more than 60 pages of police reports written by officers who responded to various calls about the house, which is about 45 miles (72 kilometers) northwest of Chicago.

One report described seeing the home littered with dog feces and urine, and a children’s bedroom where “the smell of feces was overwhelming.” Another report said the officer found the house to be “cluttered, dirty and in disrepair,” and without electrical power.

The heavily-redacted reports also indicate state child welfare workers were called after officers spotted a large bruise on one of the young boys living there, but that the children appeared to be “healthy and happy” and were not removed from the house.

Cunningham and Freund were in court Tuesday seeking custody of their 4-year-old son, Parker. Parker was taken into custody by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services on Thursday after Andrew was reported missing by his parents.",https://www.wfla.com/national/5-year-old-illinois-boy-s-body-found-in-shallow-grave-parents-charged-with-murder/1950001084,2019-04-24T20:16:58Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
834,"Pensacola removes Blue Duck Scooters from downtown, plans to review their legality","Story Highlights Blue Duck scooters launched their app-based transit system in Pensacola on April 11

On Monday, a citizen alerted the city attorney that Blue Duck did not have a business license

The PPD ordered the removal of the electric scooters from Pensacola on Tuesday

The city is now deciding whether to craft an ordinance that would allow Blue Duck back in Pensacola

Less than two weeks after launching in Pensacola, Blue Duck Scooters have been removed from downtown after city officials learned the scooter sharing service did not have a business license to operate in the city.

City spokeswoman Allie Norton said the San Antonio-based transit company had its e-scooters removed from downtown on Tuesday. While they are not permanently banned, there is no timetable for their return.

""Our city's attorney's office was approached by a citizen Monday who told us that the scooter company was operating without a city of Pensacola business license,"" Norton said. ""Our city attorney confirmed this, then asked (Pensacola Police Department) Police Chief Tommi Lyter to let company representatives know they had to stop operations and collect their scooters.""

Blue Duck Scooters arrives in Pensacola: Scooters arrive in Pensacola for trial run

Before Blue Duck can acquire a business license — which company representatives said they are prepared to do — Norton said the city has decided to research the legality of motorized scooter use on city sidewalks and could possibly craft an ordinance that would allow the company to return downtown.

The City Council would have to approve any proposed ordinance. The state allows each city to determine whether it will regulate motorized scooter use.

""Florida allows it if local municipalities have an ordinance in place that say it's OK,"" Norton said. ""We're not saying that this business isn't welcome in Pensacola, we just have to make sure it's legally allowed. And the way we make sure it's legally allowed is by letting our legal department research it and then having city counsel sign off on it.""

Blue Duck National Director of Government Affairs Casey Whittington said the company has gotten great feedback from users since launching in Pensacola on April 11 and would like to remain in the city for the long haul.

""We have no intention of leaving,"" Whittington said. ""We're being very transparent with the city and working with them on this process as they go through some things. But we aren't worried about the process.""

How Blue Duck Scooters works

For the past couple of weeks, the roughly 30 e-scooters have been docked at various locations downtown, waiting for users to unlock them through the Blue Duck Scooter app. After use, the company encourages riders to drop them off at their destination points.

Blue Duck employees stationed in Pensacola collected the scooters each night before servicing them and returning them the following morning for deployment.

No injuries or incidents have been reported to the PPD since Blue Duck arrived in Pensacola, according to police records.

Still, some people like Tim Richardson, a frequent Pensacola visitor who said he plans to soon move to the city, are concerned about the scooters. Richard has seen a number of scooter sharing service companies come through his native Nashville.

""It's not a welcome addition to Nashville in the sense that no one knows the rules around scooter ridership, so the people on the scooters are riding on the sidewalks, they're riding in the bike lanes, they're riding in the streets, and they're weaving in and out of all these different channels of transportation,"" Richardson said. ""So you never really know what scooter riders are going to do so it's hard for drivers to drive safely and defensively. It's hard for pedestrians, too. It creates a lot of anxiety and anger, to be honest with you.""

He said he backs the city's decision to pause Blue Duck operations in Pensacola.

""We love Pensacola and we want to move there, so we want it to stay walkable,"" Richardson said, on behalf of his family. ""We want it to stay pleasant and walkable, and we feel like scooters work against that.""

Making downtown Pensacola walkable

A host of downtown businesses like Global Grill, Nomadic Eats and Taco Agave have made positive posts on social media recently to either endorse the Blue Duck scooters or make residents aware of them.

Downtown Improvement Board Executive Director Lissa Dees said she thinks the last-mile transportation system would be a fabulous fit in Pensacola, as long as it is deemed legal and safe by the city.

""Mayor Grover Robinson has said he wants our streets to be 'Complete Streets' and multi-modal streets that include bikes, roller blades and scooters like these,"" Dees said. ""So I think (Blue Duck) can absolutely be a positive and a plus, but if any company is going to come here, they need to establish their business. If they are going to take up public assets like the sidewalk, they need to get it cleared with the city.""

Complete Streets: Pensacola's search for Complete Streets planner: How the hiring process may unfold

Bills currently in the state House and Senate would set up a regulatory framework for the shared scooter service industry, but nothing has been finalized.

Whittington, Blue Duck's government affairs director, said he is accustomed to that gray area, and said the company is willing to cooperate fully so it can get its scooters back downtown permanently.

""If you look at most city codes and charters there doesn't really exist a bucket that you can place this business model in,"" Whittington said. ""So what we're doing with a lot of our city partners is we're just saying, 'Hey, here's how we think we fit here, and here's how we would like it and here's how we think we'd protect you guys and the citizens.'

""So just working together on those things is really crucial.""

MARTIN COUNTY— Over 900 hepatitis A vaccinations were given to uninsured and under-insured people within Martin County by the county's Department of Health last week.

On Wednesday morning, local Health Department officials discussed preventative measures and general information on the hepatitis A outbreak to members of the school board and county officials.

U.S. Rep. Brian Mast scheduled a press conference for Thursday afternoon regarding legislation to increase access to the hepatitis A vaccination in at-risk communities.

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious disease that attacks the liver. The majority of the people who get the virus have flu-like symptoms — such as nausea, vomiting and fevers — but recover within a week or two. It's unusual for the virus to cause death.

As of Wednesday morning, the number of cases of hepatitis A in the county remained at 19, with three confirmed deaths resulting from complications of hepatitis A, according to Florida Department of Health's Martin County spokeswoman Renay Rouse.

The number of cases and related deaths has remained at those numbers since April 8, she said.

Jeffrey Kirsch and his wife, Nancy Kirsch, both 62, were found dead in their Palm City home March 28. Lee Collins, 61, died March 31. The cause of death for all was ""complications of hepatitis A.""

Of the 19 people infected, more than half are men and 42 percent of them are over the age of 60, according to a report from the Martin County Department of Health.

The report noted eight people infected with the virus are older than 60. Eight others are between the ages of 30 and 49. The other three are between 20 and 29.

According to Rouse, the best way to prevent the virus is to get vaccinated and to practice good hygiene.

If people don't remember if they have previously gotten the vaccine or if women are pregnant, Rouse said they are still able to get the vaccine without problems.

The Health Department is planning to have another walk-in vaccination opportunity for residents in the coming weeks in Indiantown, Rouse said. A specific date has not been set as of Wednesday morning.

836,Turning the Toxic Tide: Permanently ban offshore drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico,"CLOSE Fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig Deepwater Horizon Wednesday April 21, 2010, more than 50 miles Southeast of Venice, LA. Wochit

Despite election-year assurances from Rick Scott and President Trump, a special Florida exemption was never made official in law or policy.

Turning the Toxic Tide is a series of editorials published collectively by the six editorial boards of USA TODAY Network-Florida, with the goal of providing an environmental road map for Florida's governor, legislators and congressional delegation. This is the sixth in the series.

In late June of 2010 — 65 days after oil from BP’s Deepwater Horizon began gushing into the Gulf of Mexico — Pensacola’s world-famous white sand beaches were slathered black with oil. A grotesque mixture of dense, sticky tarballs and floating sheets of muck that government officials referred to as “mousse” washed ashore at the height of the Panhandle’s tourist season.

The mess was immense and hopeless. BP joined with federal, state and local officials to deploy emergency cleanup teams — haphazardly-trained workers with the Sisyphean mission of raking, shoveling and scouring miles of slimed coastline. It was hundreds of workers versus trillions of grains of oil-stained sand. The sheer scale of the cleanup was impossible.

In this April 21, 2010, file photo, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig burns in the Gulf of Mexico following an explosion that killed 11 workers and caused the worst offshore oil spill in the nation's history. President Donald Trump is throwing out a policy devised by his predecessor for protecting U.S. oceans and the Great Lakes, replacing it with a new approach that emphasizes use of the waters to promote economic growth.

But then, the hopeless day slipped into night and by morning, Pensacola’s beaches were white again. It seemed miraculous.

Reporters and photographers stood in the sunrise at a loss. The scene defied logic. There was no explanation.

But that did not stop government officials and BP spokesmen from offering one: We did it! Cleanup accomplished. The raking and shoveling and scouring worked. Your beach is saved.

That was when a young Pensacola News Journal reporter dug a few inches below the sugar-white surface. And there it was — the oil. Thick, sticky masses of it. The disaster was still there, because, of course it was. The overnight tides had simply powdered the sludge with a veneer of fresh, white sand.

And just like that, in the face of evidence, the official, government-coordinated public information campaign shifted from braggadocious celebration back to emergency apologetic cleanup mode. And the message for citizens in that moment was too clear — state, local and federal officials were willing to lie to our faces, even as the hard truth sat just inches below the sand.

This flashback should stand as a cautionary tale for Floridians statewide as they hear Gov. Ron DeSantis downplay “growing concerns that President Donald Trump is putting Florida’s coastal waters back in play for oil exploration,” as the News Service of Florida reported this month.

With a stream of troubling signs currently floating on the horizon, Floridians need to keep watch.

Reports have circulated since last year of Trump administration plans to auction leases off Florida’s coast for exploratory drilling — especially in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Knowing their constituents overwhelmingly reject drilling off Florida beaches, state politicians have said it would never happen. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott infamously held an election-year press conference with Trump’s scandal-prone former Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke,to announce Florida would be exempt from any plans to expand drilling.

Politico later reported Trump did not approve the announcement, as it contradicted his message of “energy dominance.” So a special Florida exemption was never made official in law or policy. As it stands, there is not even a tweet that guarantees Trump won’t embrace efforts to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.

Couple Trump’s unpredictability with the recent confirmation of his new Interior Secretary, David Bernhardt — a former oil lobbyist notorious for his conflicts of interest. So notorious, in fact, that USA TODAY’S Ledyard King reported that the Interior Department’s inspector general opened an ethics investigation into Bernhardt after receiving a “wide assortment” of complaints and allegations of violations.

Turning the Toxic Tide part II: Florida needs new approach to environmental regulation

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has sought to roll back safety regulations put in place after the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill by ending requirements for third-party inspections of safety equipment. Instead, oil companies would be trusted to police themselves.

To Trump, this is about energy independence. The president issued an executive order this month that calls for ""increased regulatory certainty for new energy infrastructure."" Speeding up approvals will certainly benefit the oil industry and the jobs it supports. But what about the rest of us?

During the first week of April, a bizarre event rolled into Pensacola sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute, which hosted a luncheon featuring former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who offered a sales pitch to “explore” offshore drilling. The event was as poorly attended as it was out-of-place. But it’s another sure sign of a shark-like industry seeking to work it’s way closer into local waters.

Turning the Toxic Tide part IV: Storage, treatment projects must be at heart of water efforts

Turning the Toxic Tide part V: Time to fix the problem of poop in Florida

In the face of all this, you don’t have to be an industry analyst to see what’s coming. Shallow assurances from DeSantis about Trump’s Florida loyalties sound naive at best.

However, if the politicians are not to be trusted, perhaps politics could be what stave off a predatory drilling industry from expanding into Florida waters. Contempt for drilling in Florida is bipartisan. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed 64% oppose it. Floridians overwhelmingly passed a ban on drilling in closer-to-shore state waters last November. If it can’t be for all the right reasons, maybe pure populist sentiment is the most powerful thing preventing Trump from allowing the oil industry to deface the pristine Gulf view of future Florida beachgoers.

And this is why Floridians must speak up, stay vigilant and maintain an intelligent distrust for pledges and promises from elected officials.

A federal moratorium on energy exploration in the eastern Gulf of Mexico is set to expire in 2022. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio filed a bill in January that would extend the eastern Gulf moratorium by five years.

It's time for lawmakers, the governor and the president to make the ban permanent. Take Florida, and the waters that surround it, off the table.

U.S. Reps. Francis Rooney and Matt Gaetz this month asked Trump for an Oval Office meeting to discuss banning oil and gas drilling east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf. Still, that would leave vulnerable a stretch of the westernmost waters off Florida's Panhandle, including Pensacola.

Nine years ago, citizens in Northwest Florida watched helplessly as the Gulf of Mexico was poisoned. They watched as the disaster killed fish, sickened dolphins, crushed fisheries, destroyed jobs and decimated the tourism economy in one of the poorest counties in the state.

Clean water is lifeblood in Florida. We cannot risk a repeat of that fate.

Prosecutors released audio of 80 phone calls made from jail by accused double-murderer Austin Harrouff to family and friends during a seven-day span in January. While many concerned Harrouff's daily life in jail and questions about what was happening with his mother and grandmother, in one call, Harrouff's father Wade said he was frustrated trying to get answers about the case. And he offered a defense that seemed to blame the victims: ""How it started, I think, is the main thrust of it all. I mean, how it started is not necessarily your fault,"" Wade Harrouff told his son.Earlier Wade Harrouff told Austin a friend said he believed Austin would be offered a plea deal in the 2016 murders of John Stevens III and Michelle Mishcon.Austin protested, saying ""I want the truth to come out.""""I don't see why you want the truth out, I mean, the truth is pretty gruesome, isn't it?"" Wade Harrouff asked.""It's better than you think,"" Austin replied.Later, Wade Harrouff returned to the topic, saying, ""You know, what I believe - you don't have to say yes or no - but I believe you got in the car, and they stopped you.""Austin answered: ""I can't talk about it.""Wade continued, ""I think the reason why is they had something to do with what happened, right? Not just you, they had something to do with what happened.""""I was trying to flee out of danger, that's all I can say,"" Austin said. According to court records, Austin Harrouff told a defense psychologist he sensed evil the night he randomly attacked Stevens and Mishcon in their garage and yard, and started stabbing the couple to death.Police said they found him on top of Stevens growling and biting his flesh, and refused to stop even after being hit with a taser and bitten by a K-9.The psychologist reported that Harrouff suffered from mental illness and thought he was ""half-dog, half-man.""Wade Harrouff brings up a dog being at the crime scene during the same call. It is unclear if he was fishing for information about the half-dog, half-man theory, or if he was wondering why - and if - Austin was trying to get into the Stevens' car.""They said on the TV there was a dog in the car and I can't figure out how the dog would stay in the car in all that mess,"" Wade Harrouff said.""I don't know, but it's confusing isn't it?""

VERO BEACH — At ages 95 and 89 respectively, Albert and Donna LaBonte have done a lot of living.

The couple, who have been married for more than 50 years and been business owners in Vero Beach for decades, have finally decided it’s time to retire.

On April 30, the couple will close their electrical repair and fixture business, Candlelite, on Old Dixie Highway, and plan to spend their free time on projects around their own home.

The shop has been a fixture in Vero Beach, repairing and selling lamps and other electrical items, as well as lampshades.

It’s not the first time the LaBontes have tried retirement. About 14 years ago, they closed their shop on Royal Palm Pointe and planned to enjoy a slower pace of life.

But that retirement lasted for about a month, Albert LaBonte said.

(Photo: PATRICK DOVE/TCPALM)

“We started getting cabin fever,” he joked. “So we looked around and found this place on Old Dixie Highway and figured we’d work another five or six years.”

That five or six years turned into 14, which Donna LaBonte describes as a pleasure, mostly due to customers who have returned time and time again.

“We really enjoyed this business,” Donna LaBonte said. “We’ve met such nice people; it has been a pleasure to serve them at the shop.”

More:Photos from Vero Beach Easter Parade 2019

One of those customers, Judy Orcutt of Vero Beach, said she has shopped at Candlelite for years, including at their previous location on Royal Palm Pointe.

""I just happened to stop by for a lampshade and learned that they are going out of business,"" said Orcutt, in an email to the TCPalm newsroom. ""The couple who has run it forever are always so upbeat and cheerful. The woman told me her husband is close to 100 and she is right behind.""

The LaBontes moved to Vero Beach in 1979 from South Florida, where they owned a shopping center in Palm Beach Gardens. When they sold the property for the eventual construction of “Golden Bear Plaza,” they headed north to Vero Beach, purchased a home and continued their electrical contracting business they had operated in Palm Beach Gardens.

Selling lighting fixtures was almost an accidental business for the LaBontes, who turned a spare bedroom in their home into a showroom.

“When I was doing electrical work at new homes, people would pick out fixtures but the order would never come in,” said Albert LaBonte. “So I decided to buy the fixtures, put them up in my house and people could come and pick out what they wanted. Then I knew I would have them.”

Albert LaBonte was a fighter pilot in World War II and Donna also earned her pilot’s license. Neither flies any more but both still have driver’s licenses. It’s Donna who’s doing most of the driving these days. Their health is relatively good — neither has seen a doctor since the 1980s — but despite some aches and pains, they’ve continued to work six days a week.

If there’s a secret to a successful, long business career and marriage, Albert LaBonte said it’s two things — moderation and a sense of humor.

“Most of the people know about my sense of humor,” said Albert LaBonte. “They come in and ask me if I have a new joke for them. I figure I’d rather have them laughing with me than at me.”

Candlelite is having a “going out of business sale"" with inventory being sold at greatly reduced prices.

But when April 30 rolls around, the store will close and whatever hasn’t sold will head off to thrift stores. Coincidentally, April 30 is also the day Albert LaBonte turns 96.

“We’ve been working at this for 60 years,” he said. “People are always asking me what we’re going to be doing next. And the answer is always the same — very little.”

842,Fuds returns to The Boardwalk,"OKALOOSA ISLAND — The Emerald Coast’s biggest “family reunion” descends upon The Boardwalk this week.

We’re talking about Emerald Coast Volleyball Week, of course, affectionately known by the volleyball community and locals as “Fuds.”

But this is no normal Fuds. This is the 30th anniversary edition.

Fittingly, the five-day bi-annual tournament is attracting a record turnout – 314 teams currently, more than 1,300 volleyball players and another 1,600 spectators are expected. The field is so packed that 15 teams were on the waiting list as of Tuesday.

The field includes talent from Canada, California, the Midwest and the entire Southeast, providing for an eclectic group craving community and competition.

“They’re coming from everywhere,” said tournament organizer Mike Minich, who’s been in charge since 1993. “I just met a group who came in on a red-eye from Los Angeles.

“The weather’s looking good, the beach is looking good and everybody’s ready. This is just a big group of people who are friends who get to see each other a couple of times a year.”

The fun begins Wednesday at The Boardwalk with co-ed doubles running from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. An afterparty kicks off later at 7 at The Boardwalk.

Thursday features single-gender doubles from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and a Luau at Al’s Beach Club at 7 p.m. Then Friday is the King/Queen/Kid of the Beach from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., a tremendous way of meeting people considering you’re partnered with a different person each game.

Saturday and Sunday marks the main event, a four-player tournament (men, women and co-ed divisions) that will draw somewhere in the realm of 1,600 spectators for the finals on Sunday. Play begins at 9 a.m. both days and the Women’s Open Finals is at 2 p.m. Sunday and the Men’s Open Finals follows at 3.

“As far as amateur, it’s some of the best volleyball you’ll see in the region,” said Minich, who noted the field will also feature lauded profession Ed Ratlidge.

The name for the tournament is derived from Fudpucker’s, an iconic local restaurant with a location in Destin that serves as the chief sponsor of the event alongside Ramada Plaza Beach Resort.

The first tournament was in 1989 and was sponsored chiefly by Abbott Resorts. Fudpucker’s was one of the sponsors, donating beer and gumbo and even putting a team together to play. After the tournament was over, Abbott Realty asked the Fudpucker’s team if they would take it over.

The rest is history, the local eatery becoming the face of the tourney. Three decades since the tournament started, the bi-annual showcase has grown in both numbers and reputation.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/sports/20190423/fuds-returns-to-boardwalk?rssfeed=true,2019-04-23T13:03:45Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

Cases of hepatitis A are popping up across South Florida

A South Florida doctor says the best way to prevent spreading the rare Hepatitis A virus to others is through constant hand-washing and vaccinations after a Palm City couple recently died from the infection.Dr. Jamie Snarski, a PBG Medical Center emergency room physician, said Hepatitis A is a virus that attacks the liver. If the infection is left untreated, it can lead to liver failure or death in extreme cases.“People who are in schools, camps or live together can certainly pass it along very easily,” Snarski said. However, Snarski says it is extremely rare for anyone born after 1995 to contract it after doctors began vaccinating children for the virus. Anyone born before the vaccine was available has the highest risk of getting the infection.“There is a variety of ways people can get it. They can get it from contaminated food or water sources, Snarski said. “They can also get it from someone who already has it.”She says if a person is exposed, it can take up to a month before the host will experience symptoms, if any at all. “It usually goes away on its own after one to two months,” the doctor added.But in extreme cases, an infected person can experience vomiting, diarrhea, joint pain, fatigue and jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes.Snarski says the best way to prevent the infection is to get vaccinated. “After vaccination, the best thing we can do is hand-washing because hand-washing will literally prevent the spread of this disease,” Snarski told WPBF.

Hepatitis A is a virus that attacks the liver. If the infection is left untreated, it can lead to liver failure or death in extreme cases.

“People who are in schools, camps or live together can certainly pass it along very easily,” Snarski said.

However, Snarski says it is extremely rare for anyone born after 1995 to contract it after doctors began vaccinating children for the virus.

Anyone born before the vaccine was available has the highest risk of getting the infection.

“There is a variety of ways people can get it. They can get it from contaminated food or water sources, Snarski said. “They can also get it from someone who already has it.”

She says if a person is exposed, it can take up to a month before the host will experience symptoms, if any at all.

“It usually goes away on its own after one to two months,” the doctor added.

But in extreme cases, an infected person can experience vomiting, diarrhea, joint pain, fatigue and jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes.

851,"A wealthy developer, a local actress, a failed hotel project and an indecent proposal","Palm Beach actress Mia Matthews is busy these days rehearsing in New York City for the upcoming off-Broadway premiere of “After,"" a play about the consequences of a bullying text message.

Off stage, she’s immersed in another emotional production involving texts, this one a bizarre personal drama with one of her biggest admirers — Palm Beach Polo President Glenn Straub.

It’s a drama with salacious allegations detailed in court records, including one ripped from a Hollywood script: In what amounted to an indecent proposal, Straub, who has known Matthews and her husband, Robert “Bob” Matthews, for 20 years, is alleged to have said he let a $27 million mortgage go unpaid “every time Bob let him sleep with Mia.""

Straub denied making any such proposal, although he has engaged in business deals with the Matthewses over the years, including a last-minute loan that saved their Nantucket summer home from foreclosure in 2010.

But he admits sending Mia flirtatious text messages last year, sometimes as a joke, including one with a reference to oral sex. He also bought her earrings, took her to a Broadway show, offered to pay her daughter's tuition, gave loaner cars to the family and provided $300,000 to help Mia and Bob hire criminal lawyers, according to court records.

Those apparent extensions of generosity came at a time when Mia and her husband were desperate and vulnerable: They had been targeted and later charged in a federal fraud investigation into a failed Palm Beach hotel project.

Prosecutors were building a case that Bob, Mia and others had misused millions of dollars that was supposed to be spent to renovate the Palm House Hotel, court records show. The money had been pledged through a federal program by foreign investors seeking green cards.

Bob and Mia are accused of spending some of that money on mortgage and tax payments for their homes and lavish indulgences, such as a yacht, luxury cars and a Paris vacation on a private plane, according to prosecutors.

Bob was among four men, including his brother, arrested in March on multiple fraud charges. As the Palm House scandal swirled in the months before Mia’s arrest in August on a single count of tax evasion, Straub pursued her for an intimate relationship and told her to leave her husband, according to text messages described in court records and a provocative legal argument targeting Straub.

But when Mia refused his advances, he sued her and Bob demanding they return the money he said he loaned them for their lawyers. He also filed a separate lawsuit against the Connecticut law firm representing Bob Matthews, demanding the return of the $150,000 retainer Palm Beach Polo had wired in May.

Mia is not the first female friend Straub has taken to court. Since 2013, five former girlfriends, all significantly younger than Straub, have been sued by his companies over alleged broken debts, The Palm Beach Post reported in November. Two of those women said the lawsuits are frivolous and accused Straub of suing only because they broke up with him.

Although Mia never accused Straub in court records of suing for romantic revenge, lawyers in a Palm House bankruptcy case say he filed the lawsuit just days after she rebuffed his advances.

In court records, Mia said $150,000 of the money “was not a loan but was instead a gift” provided by Straub “without expectation of repayment."" Similar claims were made by other women who have been sued by him.

Straub dismissed the lawsuit against Bob and Mia on Jan. 28 after he said they “paid a good chunk of it back,"" he told The Post. His lawsuit against Bob Matthews’ criminal law firm was settled in December, a few weeks after a Connecticut judicial panel dismissed a professional grievance that Straub had filed against the firm.

Straub, 72, denies having ever been anything more than just a “close friend” to Mia, 52.

In August, he offered a different take on Mia to an FBI agent. Straub considered Mia “an instigator” who drove her husband ""to the ‘high life'” and Bob “'a ‘salesman’ who used ‘every tactic’ to keep Mia happy in the lifestyle,"" according to an FBI memo shown during a Palm House bankruptcy trial.

Bob, 61, and Mia, who each pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges, both declined to comment for this story. Mia referred questions to her attorney, Brian Spears of Connecticut, who declined to comment.

Bob and Mia certainly were aware of Straub’s litigious history — they’d been sued by him at least once before, in 2010 over the Nantucket loan. But with the Palm House scandal engulfing them, they had no other choice but to lean on the wealthy businessman for help.

“(I)f you look at Wikipedia under Glenn Straub it says most litigious person in South Florida,"" Bob Matthews said at a Securities and Exchange Commission hearing in January 2017.

“I mean, Glenn loves to have coffee with you in the morning, sue you in the afternoon and play tennis with you in the evening. He has this thing where it’s fun. He loves going to court.""

‘Famous signer’ in the USA

Mia’s smiling face once briefly adorned an electronic billboard in Times Square, an image used in a Palm House promotional brochure sent a few years ago to potential investors in China, Iran and Turkey.

The brochures claimed, erroneously, according to federal prosecutors, that former President Bill Clinton, singer Tony Bennett and other celebrities had pledged to be members of the Palm House Club “due in part to the fame of Mia Matthews, the developer Robert Matthews’ wife. Mia Matthews is a famous signer"" — the word “singer” is misspelled — “and entertainer in the USA.""

How famous? That’s up for interpretation. But by most accounts, Mia has enjoyed a modestly successful career.

She had an uncredited appearance as a bartender in a 1997 episode of Michael J. Fox’s “Spin City” and she enjoyed a 52-episode run playing a witch called Desdemona in Nickelodeon’s “Every Witch Way” in 2014-15.

Her website mentions films, brief television roles on a Fox’s “13 Bourbon Street” and the short-lived Hulu series “South Beach,” along with appearances on David Letterman and in TV commercials for Old Navy and the Florida Lottery.

She won a regional acting award for her performance in 2016 in a Miami play, and she can be seen in YouTube clips singing and cartwheeling in “The Bombshell Show,” in which she portrays iconic singers.

Straub said he has attended some of Mia’s performances. Watching her cartwheel across the stage during “The Bombshell Show” a few years ago made an impression on the wealthy developer.

“I knew of her because she was an actress and I’d seen her at different events and she’d do that cartwheel,"" Straub, who has been divorced since 2009, said in a deposition. Her “claim to fame is that she does a cartwheel, a perfect cartwheel, on stage.""

Since Mia married Bob in 1997, she enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle with homes in Palm Beach, Nantucket and Connecticut. In recent years, they were members of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a Lago Club, the Breakers and the Kravis Center, and Mia drove luxury cars such as an Aston Martin, Maserati and Mercedes Hummer, according to statements her husband’s bookkeeper gave to SEC investigators in 2016.

Photos of Mia and Bob on Nantucket with the Clintons, actor Alec Baldwin and the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy — photo ops made decades ago through her husband’s business and political connections — were included in Palm House promotional material.

More recently, she has mingled at Palm Beach society events with Trump, Palm Beach billionaire Bill Koch, golfer Greg Norman and, of course, Straub.

‘A father figure’

No stranger to controversy, Straub is a proud, hard-nosed businessman with a talent for mining gold from distressed properties and a penchant for butting heads with opponents big and small. He can be pugnacious and polarizing — in January, he was accused of making racially insensitive comments at a Wellington Village Council meeting.

He has forged connections to powerful people, including State Attorney Dave Aronberg, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath and President Trump, who also knows Mia. (In a deposition, Straub says Trump asked about Mia during a phone conversation Straub says he had with the president last summer.)

Straub doesn’t deny that he finds Mia attractive. “She raised two kids, she works and she is beautiful,"" he said.

But he said he always considered himself more as “a father figure” to her, a contention challenged by attorneys opposing Straub in the bankruptcy case. It is the bankruptcy case files, of all places, that contain the most salacious allegations about Straub’s “bizarre and influential” relationship with Mia and her husband.

Straub and Mia have had “a very complicated relationship"" that at some point was “intimate,"" according to allegations by attorney Phil Landau, who represents the entity that owns the Palm House property in the bankruptcy case filed in August.

Why else, he asked, would Straub continue doing business with Mia and her husband after he’d sued them for defaulting on a short-term $775,000 loan Straub gave in 2010 to save their Nantucket home from foreclosure?

That loan included an unusual stipulation, added by Straub, for Matthews to sell the home and put the proceeds into a trust for the benefit of Mia and the couple’s two daughters.

Then there’s the letter Straub wrote to federal prosecutors in June, three months after Bob Matthews was arrested and ordered to stop communicating with potential witnesses, Landau said.

In the letter, Straub asked prosecutors to make an exception for him, describing himself as “an acquaintance” of Bob Matthews and “a close friend” of Mia’s who needed to “provide moral support” since “all of the Matthewses’ other friends are avoiding them because of the indictment.""

Even though permission was granted, Straub said he hasn’t had too much communication lately with Bob Matthews. But he apparently has communicated plenty with Matthews’ wife.

Salacious text messages

Mia hasn’t said much publicly about her relationship with Straub. In fact, she invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 600 times in a deposition Nov. 26 when two lawyers grilled her for seven hours about flirtatious text messages Straub exchanged with her last year.

The actual texts are not included in court records. The only public description of their contents comes from a transcript of the attorneys reading them during the deposition, and those were only a sample of the texts Straub and Mia exchanged.

The text messages, the attorneys say, show that Straub either had or at least pursued a relationship with Mia that went beyond friendship, making him an “insider” who shouldn’t be allowed to seek claims in the Palm House bankruptcy.

“(A)s bad my situation is, I can’t accept your offer to be a significant other in order for you to drop the lawsuit,"" Mia texted Straub on July 16, more than a week after his company sued her and Bob.

“This whole thing is heartbreaking,"" her text continues. “I can’t say that we would end up together, but I will say any hopes of that are dashed with your recent actions and behavior. Being with someone who threatens to put me in jail, promises things, then takes them away, and tells me that he will do whatever he can to destroy me, won’t work. I wish things were different.""

But when the lawyers asked her to elaborate on those and other texts, her response was the same: “On advice of counsel, I’m exercising my rights under the Fifth Amendment and declining to answer the question.""

During the depositions, neither Mia, Straub nor their lawyers disputed the authenticity of the texts.

Texts earlier in the year suggest Mia made several requests to Straub — for a job, for money for her daughter’s acting class and for permission to use his credit card to go shopping.

Other texts suggest they attended a Broadway show. And in others, Straub appears to offer her an apartment in Aspen, Colo., and legal advice about her husband’s criminal case.

On July 3, Straub texted Mia a warning that he planned to sue her in St. Lucie County, an hour from Palm Beach County, to “keep these facts out of the public eyes and your daughter’s friends’ gossip. …"" In a deposition in November, Straub confirmed the text, saying, “That’s a little trick I got. To keep things out of the newspaper, I’ll sue in other counties.""

A month later, on Aug. 8, Mia sent Straub a text that Landau assumed was about her husband: “I talked to him. Told him the truth. He was relieved we didn’t have sexual contact. And understood my desperation in trying to get you to back off the lawsuit. …""

‘You anxious boy’

Other texts sound racy.

“Any interest in a dinner and sleepover party?” Straub asks May 20. Mia replies, “I have church at five. Could do dinner after but no sleepovers yet. You anxious boy.""

On June 18, Mia texted Straub about a pair of earrings she wanted to give to her daughter: “I think I may give her the little hoops you bought me. Is that okay with you?"" Straub replies, “Okay, as you know the prices of gold doubled, so I get one BJ for each side over three days.""

When Landau read those texts, an attorney for Straub’s lending company interjected. “Are you done? Is there a question there? I want to express my embarrassment on your behalf, Phil,"" said attorney Luis Salazar.

Landau replied, “And I’m embarrassed that we have to be here reading through this.""

In his own deposition three days later, Straub was asked if the “BJ” reference was meant as a colloquial term for oral sex.

“When you’re acting as a father figure to women, do you suggest that they should come and give you three BJs for something that you’re doing for them?” asked attorney David George, who represents 61 Palm House investors from China, Iran and Turkey who sued the Matthewses, Straub’s lending company and others in federal court in 2016.

Straub replied, “I do a lot of that kind of comments. To me, it’s like your first-born child. If you don’t pay me, you owe me a BJ. In other words, that’s very, very personal to people. They will usually pay you the money they owe you. …""

Straub admits he encouraged Mia to leave her husband, who is facing 325 years in prison if convicted on all counts, and to move to Aspen. But only so she can get a new start on her life, not to run off with him.

“You can interpret those texts to whatever you want. I never had sex with the girl,"" Straub said Nov. 29 in a deposition. “I’m saying to you, she always fascinated me that she was a worker like my daughters.""

Disputing the attorneys’ characterization, Straub said, “I wouldn’t call it an intimate relationship. It is a relationship with a woman that has got herself in trouble through her husband.""

Mia didn’t invoke the Fifth for every question during her seven-hour deposition. When Landau asked why she was crying, she replied, “My eyes are watering from yawning and from not getting a lot of, from work.""

Straub, who attended her deposition, interjected with a skeptical remark: “She’s an actress.""

‘Character assassination’

Perhaps the most explosive allegation about Straub and Mia was made by developer Ryan Black, a minority owner of Palm House, in an email to Landau on Aug. 29.

Describing a meeting he attended at Straub’s Wellington office in November 2014, Black said Straub was asked why he’d waited to foreclose on the Palm House mortgage five months after Matthews had started defaulting on payments.

Straub replied that “he would give Bob an extension every time Bob let him sleep with Mia,"" according to Black’s email, which is included in court records.

In an interview with The Post, Straub said, “I don’t remember ever, ever making that kind of remark. If I did, I’m sure it was a dumb joke. I’m a 72-year-old guy. I’m allowed to make some dumb-ass jokes.""

Black didn’t return a phone call and email from The Post.

Although Straub wasn’t asked about the Black email during his deposition, he was questioned about the “sleepover” text he’d sent Mia.

“I’d love to have her stay, spend some time with me, but she was always coy,"" he replied. “That’s why we never had sex. She’s been a player from day one.""

In court records, Salazar, the lawyer for Straub’s lending company, accused Landau of resorting to “a character assassination strategy” against Straub because he has a weak case.

“Debtor then makes up this deficit in substantive, relevant facts by dumping a truckload of tabloid fodder that might support newspaper sales in the checkout aisle but here amount to irrelevant tripe,"" Salazar said in an October filing.

None of the salacious allegations about Straub and Mia were mentioned in the time-limited, non-jury Palm House federal bankruptcy trial that ended Feb. 22 when a judge invalidated Straub’s mortgage claim on the hotel.

Meanwhile, Straub continues to deny accusations by Palm House investors in federal and state civil lawsuits that his lending company conspired with Matthews to steal their money.

Best supporting actress?

Barring another rescue from Straub, Bob and Mia won’t be living much longer at Casa Bendita, the spacious $30 million oceanfront mansion they built in 2006 next to a house owned until September by fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.

Once the scene of society galas and charity parties hosted by the couple, Casa Bendita — Spanish for “Blessed House” — is scheduled to be sold at an auction March 28 as part of Bob Matthews’ personal bankruptcy case.

A few months after that, Bob and Mia are scheduled to stand trial in Connecticut along with Palm Beach attorney Les Evans in the Palm House criminal case.

But before that trial, Mia will be judged on-stage April 8 at the 43rd Annual Carbonell Awards, which honor the best of South Florida theater.

She’s been nominated as best supporting actress for her role as Marie Antoinette in “The Revolutionists” at the Theatre Lab in Boca Raton. It’s not her first Carbonell nod.

In 2016, she won for her role in the Miami production of “After,” the same play she’s currently rehearsing for an off-Broadway run that starts March 17 and ends April 14.

862,Family pushes for ban on texting while driving following death of their son,"- They are texting, Instagram-ing, and even Face-timing. Brooke Scherer says some drivers are doing anything but paying attention to the roads.

“They’re watching YouTube, they’re Face-timing, we see face-timing a lot,” Scherer said.

She and her husband Jordan have become hyper-aware of distracted drivers since losing their 10-year-old son Logan in 2016.

A distracted driver plowed into their family SUV while they were stopped in traffic, killing Logan instantly.

Last December, the couple stood beside Florida State Rep. Jackie Toledo, who was introducing a bill to ban texting while driving.

That bill passed Tuesday by a wide margin.

“We passed it on the House floor, 104-9,” Rep. Toledo said in an interview via Skype.

The Senate's version of the bill goes further than texting. It only allows drivers to use hands-free devices -- or nothing at all.

The two bills will have to be merged into one before it can become law.

""It's going to eliminate a lot of the ambiguity concerns,” said Brooke’s husband Jordan. “A lot of that gets thrown out the window when you're talking about a hands-free bill because it takes a question that a law enforcement officer might have, like 'I need to prove they were texting.'""

Texting and driving is already against the law, but it's a secondary offense. That means a driver can be cited for it only if they get pulled over for something else.

Both the Senate and House versions would make it a primary offense.

""I don't have to touch my phone at all to have it do anything I want it to do,” said Rep. Toledo. “Whether it's changing a radio station, or give me directions. I can even tell my phone to plug in an address to give me directions.""

The Scherers turn their phones on ""Do not disturb"" mode while they're driving.

""Do not disturb is just one option, and it's easy to employ,” Jordan Scherer said.

865,Indian River County Hospital District changes poverty qualifications; more people will get free care,"CLOSE Cleveland Clinic celebrates addition of Indian River Medical Center and Martin Health System hospitals at ceremony Jan. 9, 2019, in Port St. Lucie. Eric Hasert, eric.hasert@tcpalm.com

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — Qualifying for taxpayer-supported indigent care will be easier beginning Oct. 1 now that the county’s Hospital District changed its definition of who qualifies for financial assistance.

Currently, residents looking for help from the Hospital District must certify they are at or below 150 percent of federal poverty guidelines. But in October, that number increases to 200 percent.

A couple earning up to $33,820 would qualify for free care. A family of four can earn up to $51,500 to qualify for financial assistance.

More:Hospital sees changes since Cleveland Clinic took over

The increase brings the Hospital District closer to Cleveland Clinic Indian River Hospital’s policy for financial assistance, which states that anyone with an annual family income of up to 250 percent of federal poverty guidelines qualifies for free care if they are uninsured.

Under Cleveland Clinic's policy, an uninsured family of four can earn up to $62,500 annually to qualify for emergency and medically-necessary care.

Rather than match the 250 percent that Cleveland Clinic currently uses as its criteria, the Hospital District decided to raise its level to 200 percent until it gets a better idea of how many more patients it will cover, Hospital District program liaison Jennifer Frederick said. The district currently serves about 4,500 patients through its indigent-care program.

Those uninsured families between 251 percent and 400 percent of poverty guidelines can receive care at Cleveland Clinic Indian River Hospital on a sliding scale, a discounted amount typically billed to insured patients for such care.

Patients receiving care provided through other low-cost clinics and health care agencies, such as Treasure Coast Community Health and the Visiting Nurse Association, will be eligible for the Hospital District’s expanded assistance.

Frederick said trustees wanted to make qualifying easier for the large number of working poor that typically hold down several jobs but do not have insurance benefits.

An Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE) report, released by the United Way of Indian River County earlier this year, found 51 percent of Indian River County families struggle to pay for basic needs including health care.

“There are a large number of people who fall into the ALICE population,” said Frederick. “They hold down two or three jobs to make ends meet, but they don’t fit into the 150 percent of federal poverty level guidelines.”

Agencies that receive support from the Hospital District have been asked to use the new income ceiling when they submit funding proposals for services that will begin Oct. 1.

Two new shops to satisfy a sweet tooth recently launched in the Naples area. Mitch’s Cookies Dessert Bar & Soda Fountain opened a few weeks ago in East Naples and Nothing Bundt Cakes started up Saturday in Naples.

Nothing Bundt Cakes

Nothing Bundt Cakes is really something.

The niche bakery chain which features a simple menu sprung from a bundt pan is on a mission to spread joy one moist, flavorful cake at a time. A local franchise of Nothing Bundt Cakes, which offers bundt cakes in a variety of sizes and flavors for special occasions and everyday treats, launched Saturday in Naples.

“I know it’s going to sound like a cliche, but it’s all about joy and love,” said Karen Vazquez, owner and operator of the Naples franchise. “We choose quality ingredients. Everything is fresh. Our carrots are fresh. Our pineapples are fresh. Everything we add to our cakes is fresh.”

Products offered include 8-inch and 10-inch bundt cakes, tiered bundt cakes, miniature bundtlets and bite-sized bundtinis each with a signature cream cheese frosting. The business bakes cake rings from scratch with nine different regular flavors — vanilla, chocolate chocolate chip, white chocolate raspberry, red velvet, confetti, carrot, lemon, marble and pecan praline — as well as a seasonal flavor. This season’s flavor is strawberries and cream.

“It changes for the season, so we’ll probably have it for another couple of days. In May we’ll be introducing a lemon raspberry for the summer,” Vazquez said.

The bakery also has a gluten-free chocolate chip offering that is baked separately. “It’s delicious. It’s one of my favorites,” Vazquez said. “I have two favorite ones. I like them all, but I like the chocolate chocolate chip gluten-free and the white chocolate raspberry.”

The bundt cake opportunity was love at first taste for Vazquez, who knows a thing or two about baking.

“I was already a baker. I’ve been a baker for 28 years and here in Naples I was a fulltime baker for 15 years,” she said. “I was Kakes by Karen and I made wedding cakes, but I fell in love with Nothing Bundt Cakes after ordering one of their cakes in Texas.”

The company is based in Texas, but founders Dena Tripp and Debra Shwetz cooked up Nothing Bundt Cakes in Las Vegas in 1997 to satisfy their family and friends.

“The company was started by two ladies who were friends,” Vazquez said. “One had the cake recipe; the other one had the frosting. They married the frosting with the bundt cake.”

A private equity firm acquired the gourmet bakery chain in 2016 and it now has more than 300 locations nationwide, including at least 20 in Florida. The Naples location launched in a remodeled store space that formerly was Black Tie Tuxedos and EmbroidMe in the Goodlette Corners retail strip on the southwest corner of Goodlette-Frank and Pine Ridge roads.

Integral to the new bakery is store manager Jackeline Lopez, who met Vazquez through her local cake business.

“I’ve known Karen for 10 years because I was a customer of hers from Kakes by Karen. She custom-made my wedding cake and I was in love with her recipe,” Lopez said.

Lopez also fell in love with Nothing Bundt Cakes when she first tried a white chocolate raspberry cake that she ordered from the Sarasota location for her daughter’s birthday. She savors other flavors too.

“I love the red velvet because it has chocolate chips in it, but I’m in love with our feature flavor, the strawberries and cream,” Lopez said.

The most popular bundt cake flavors are chocolate chocolate chip, red velvet, lemon and white chocolate raspberry. An order of a dozen bundtinis features three of each of these four flavors unless custom ordered.

Beside everyday snacks or dessert, the bundt cakes are marketed for special occasions such as holidays, birthdays and even weddings. The store functions as a party planner and sells supplemental items such as platters, cutting and serving utensils and greeting cards for even last-minute special events.

“We’re a one-stop shop,” Vazquez said. “We’re like a marriage between a cutesy retail store and a mom-and-pop shop.”

“We call it a bundtique,” Lopez said.

The local franchise also will support area nonprofit agencies and schools by donating products or assisting in fundraising activities. The store’s grand opening festivities next month will benefit Make-A-Wish Southern Florida.

Nothing Bundt Cakes, 1410 Pine Ridge Road, Unit 9, is open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and closed Sundays. For more information call 239-294-2484 or go to NothingBundtCakes.com.

870,Millennial Money: Are you robbing the Bank of Mom and Dad?,"MIAMI - When Melanie Lockert graduated with a master’s in performance studies in 2011, she was overwhelmed with student loans. Her many attempts to tap the Bank of Mom and Dad had failed.

She had already worked three jobs to pay off $13,000. After juggling multiple jobs, relocating from New York to Portland, Oregon, and trimming expenses, she paid off the remaining $68,000 in 2015. Now 34, she acknowledges that tackling it herself may have been for the best.

“If my parents had agreed to fund my education, I think it would have kind of been at the expense of their own retirement,” says Lockert, a writer and founder of the Dear Debt blog.

Indeed, plenty of parents may already be behind on that count. Forty-five percent of baby boomers have nothing saved for retirement, according to a 2019 study by the Insured Retirement Institute, a financial services trade group. And with average U.S. life expectancy now at about 78 years old, a nest egg is key.

“Expectations I don’t think are set properly for how long people are going to live, so I think most families are going to need every penny (for retirement),” says Justin Castelli, CEO and financial advisor at RLS Wealth Management in Fishers, Indiana.

If your parents aren’t on track for retirement, accepting a monetary gift from them can create more financial problems than it solves.

WHAT TO CONSIDER BEFORE TAKING A GIFT

A gift from your parents could jeopardize their potential retirement earnings, but it could eventually cost you, too, if you’re their financial Plan B for their golden years. Before accepting, take these steps:

— Have a money talk. To preserve quality of life in retirement, financial planners generally recommend saving enough to replace about 70% of pre-retirement income. Castelli suggests that it depends on your parents’ goals. Find out where Mom and Dad stand. If they aren’t sure, a fee-only financial advisor can offer a clearer picture.

— Understand the costs. Parents will be required to file a gift tax return for any amount above $15,000 per parent. And depending on what account the money is coming from and when, additional taxes and penalties may apply.

— Outline expectations. Will you be financially responsible for your parents in their later years? If so, consider those future costs. For example, a 65-year-old couple who retired in 2018 would need to have saved $280,000 to cover health and medical expenses throughout retirement, according to a Fidelity estimate . Mom and Dad may be able to help you out today, but at what cost for tomorrow?

— Weigh the family dynamic. If they give you money, your parents could also feel pressured to help your siblings and further hurt their retirement savings. And if they only help you, it could lead to jealousy or hurt feelings.

— Make sure you truly need the help. As she was paying down debt, Lockert says her work ethic and creativity were pushed to the limit, forcing her to think differently about money. “I felt more confident paying large bills,” she said. If you can budget, save and take advantage of alternative resources, you might tackle financial goals yourself.

EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS

Declining a gift from your parents doesn’t mean you’re out of options:

— Make it a loan, not a gift. A family loan could be a win-win: a low interest rate, no credit check and flexible terms for you, and potentially even a profit for your parents. You can consult an attorney or opt for a do-it-yourself promissory note. But it’s not without risks. “Because it’s an official loan, there are the normal avenues of repercussions if the loan is defaulted on,” says Kyle Moore, a certified financial planner and founder of Quarry Hill Advisors in St. Paul, Minnesota. Depending on the terms, parents can call collections, take you to court or seize collateral if you fail to pay it back.

— Research other resources. If homeownership is a goal, for example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and your state’s housing finance agency feature programs designed for lower-income or first-time home buyers .

— Consolidate or refinance debt. With a good credit score (690 or higher), you can generally qualify for better interest rates to refinance student loans, transfer debt to a balance transfer credit card or consolidate other loans. Regardless of your credit score, a debt management plan from a nonprofit credit counseling agency may also lower interest rates for some debts.

This column addresses general and common concerns of people with dementia and their caregivers. All cases are inspired by true stories, but characters are fictionalized as required by federal HIPAA laws.

Thirty-some years ago, there was little to offer a patient with Alzheimer's disease other than sympathy.

As a social worker, Janet could give behavior tips, caregiver support and the names of nursing homes that had dementia units. But as a physician, I had virtually nothing to treat this devastating disease.

We used medications like papaverine, which supposedly improved circulation to the brain, vitamin E and Gingko biloba. We even tried antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and a variety of herbs and supplements.

Then in the early 1990s, researchers honed-in on a brain chemical called acetylcholine that was crucial for memory and was found to be decreased in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Attempts to create an acetylcholine “pill” weren’t successful. So the goal was then to stop the enzymes that break down acetylcholine, and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were born.

The first was tacrine (Cognex). It was taken four times a day and frequently caused liver damage. But patients, families and doctors were desperate for help and it was prescribed regularly. Soon, safer and more effective AChEIs were developed.

I call the current AChEIs the three sisters because they have similar effects and side effects. These are Donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne) and rivastigmine (Exelon) and are considered the best first-line therapy option for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

Although most people do just fine on these medications, there are some serious potential side effects including heart rhythm abnormalities, vomiting, diarrhea and headache. Donepezil is also known to worsen leg cramps and nightmares.

Sometimes we have to try a couple of different AChEI’s to find the best match.

Another brain chemical called glutamate is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's disease by causing over-stimulation of certain neurons (brain cells). The medication memantine (Namenda) was developed to decrease the over-activity by blocking some of the connecting channels, allowing a more controlled flow of information between neurons.

I've been very impressed with this medication, not only because of its effect on memory, focus and concentration, but also because of its usefulness for calming some of the difficult behaviors experienced by patients with Alzheimer's disease such as sundowning, agitation and even combativeness.

Side effects include headache, fatigue, diarrhea and elevated blood pressure, but overall it seems to be well tolerated. The ideal is to use both an AChEI and memantine.

I do stress that patients with Alzheimer's disease deserve to be started on medications. Early treatment keeps people more functional and independent for a longer period of time.

It is very rare that I will recommend against starting one of these medicines for a patient. Generally, it is only when I feel that the risk of side effects would greatly outweigh the benefit.

Unfortunately, some families were wrongly informed that these medications would not be helpful or that the effects were temporary. In other cases, families stopped the medicine after a few months because they didn't see an improvement. But just like any other medication for chronic illness, the goal is to prevent the devastating effects of unchecked disease.

Although psychosis, hallucinations and agitation can be part of Alzheimer's disease, our most difficult cases have been in patients who were not treated until the brain damage was so severe that they were totally out of control.

Every day, I send up a prayer of thanksgiving that we have medications to treat Alzheimer's disease.

874,How should Florida respond to the hepatitis A risk? Here's what happened in Kentucky,"CLOSE We answer all of your questions about hepatitis A, the highly contagious liver infection. Nikki Boliaux, Louisville Courier Journal

Officials in Martin County are at the beginning steps of assessing the risk of hepatitis A, following the deaths of a Palm City couple.

In Kentucky, it's been 17 months, 52 deaths, thousands of sick individuals and a soul search to determine if more should have been done.

The commonwealth's hepatitis A problem has ballooned into the nation's largest outbreak of the virus in the 21st century. It has spread to 103 of Kentucky’s 120 counties.

Officials there were able to identify illicit drug users and the homeless as the primary people affected by the virus. Nearly 80 percent of those diagnosed with hepatitis A in Kentucky have been drug abusers.

But the Department of Public Health struggled to reach that population, particularly in rural parts of Kentucky. State officials also cited a public health crisis that has shrunk local budgets.

""Limited resources, coupled with difficulties in reaching the at-risk population with substance abuse disorder, have presented significant logistical problems in rural Kentucky,"" said Jeffrey Howard Jr., commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Health, in a statement on Feb. 28.

Documents obtained by the Louisville Courier-Journal showed the former infectious diseases chief one year ago requested a robust response by Howard, including $6 million for more vaccines and $4 million for temporary health care workers. But the state ultimately sent $2.2 million to local departments and declined to declare an emergency, according to the USA TODAY Network affiliate.

Kentucky health officials targeted those considered at-risk for the virus by setting up vaccinations at jails, homeless shelters, substance abuse centers and syringe access programs.

Officials in Kentucky also said there was an increased risk of exposure to the public by food-service workers in high-risk infection areas. According to a national survey, 19% of food service workers report they either use or abuse substances.

886,"5th Avenue festival to feature R&B singer Glenn Jones, authors","National recording artist Glenn Jones will headline the 40th annual 5th Avenue Arts Festival this weekend.

Nkwanda Jah, executive director of the Cultural Arts Coalition and a longtime festival organizer, said the festival is pleased to bring Jones to the festival.

“He is very popular,"" Jah said. ""Last week (two weeks ago) we put feelers out and we’re very pleased to get him.”

Last-minute funding made it possible to bring Jones to the festival, Jah said. He is set to perform on the main stage at 6:30 p.m. Saturday.

She said the biggest national headliners they’ve hosted at the festival have been R&B and soul artists, including the S.O.S. Band, The Delphonics and Regina Belle, a four-time Grammy winning R&B and pop singer.

The festival will be held from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Saturday and noon-5 p.m. Sunday at Northwest Sixth Street between Third and Seventh avenues. The emcee for the festival this year will be Alicia Hayes.

The festival's theme will be “Ujamaa,” which means “collective economics” in Swahili, a language spoken in the African Great Lakes region and other parts of eastern and southeastern Africa.

She said the festival will continue to address ongoing issues, including the lack of black-owned businesses and housing for the working poor.

New this year will be the ""Authors' Corner"" featuring a number of writers, including several with local ties.

Jah shared the history of the 5th Avenue festival, which is 40 and counting.

Jah said she was a participating in a poetry conference at UF when she was encouraged to host a poetry reading event. That first event grew into a festival to include artwork, music, dancing, barbecue for sale and speakers who talked about the perils of gentrification of the Fifth Avenue neighborhood. Electricity was provided by the late Aaron Young, from his barbershop. The event was held at what is now the Gainesville Community Redevelopment Agency parking lot on Northwest Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street.

Jah said there was a group of people who noticed the Fifth Avenue/Pleasant Street community was being gentrified, and the event served to bring awareness to what was happening in the neighborhood.

After five years, the festival moved from what is now the CRA parking lot to the T.B. McPherson Recreation Center in southeast Gainesville, where it remained two or three years. Although it was a good venue that allowed for more activities, Jah said they felt the 5th Avenue festival needed to return to the neighborhood. After a couple moves in that general area, the festival is now held on Sixth Street between Third and Seventh avenues.

Artists displaying and selling their artwork will include Alyne Harris, Destiny Henderson, Allah Gore of Miami, among others.

Besides Jones, the entertainment will feature local artists, including Passion Band, Uncle B’s Groove, Expressive Song and Dance led by Elois Waters, the Star Children’s Theatre, as well as local rappers and other artists. There will be gospel song and dance performances.

Children will have learn while engaging in science activities provided by the Cade Museum of Innovation and Invention and the Florida Museum of Natural History. Art activities will be provided by the Harn Museum of Art. Children also will enjoy a bounce house, clowns, stilt walkers and more.

Vendors will sell yard art, arts and crafts, jewelry, African musical instruments, African clothing, candles and more. Food vendors will also be on hand.

Jah, who for 39 years has served as festival chairperson, said she has passed the mantle to Courtney Scott, who this year served as festival chairman. Scott, a local artist, owns Rastafarice, a shaved ice business.

“We’re ready to have big headliners for the festival, but we need to have bigger fundraisers,” Jah said. “Courtney is bringing new ideas and young people and continuing the tradition.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190424/5th-avenue-festival-to-feature-rampb-singer-glenn-jones-authors?rssfeed=true,2019-04-24T19:49:20Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608

NGakoue has been durable playing 48 games and has been a game wrecker at times with 29.5 career sacks. NGakoue made the Pro Bowl in 2017 - in other words, he's performed like a top 15 pick and not a third round pick.

TONY BRACKENS - The Jaguars all-time sacks leader (55) stopped playing in 2004 and 15 years later still holds the record. Brackens was drafted at the top of the 2nd round in 1996, but was a huge part of the glory years in the early years of the franchise.

MAURICE JONES-DREW - MJD got passed over by all 32 NFL teams - almost twice - before the Jaguars selected the running back with the 60th pick of the 2006 NFL Draft. The Jaguars got incredible value from Jones-Drew as he was a touchdown machine during his career with 79 of them and led the NFL in rushing in 2011.

RASHEAN MATHIS - The Jacksonville native was another second round hit for the Jacksonville Jaguars because he delivered with big plays. Mathis is the franchise's all time leader in interceptions and has 32 picks in his career. Mathis made the Pro Bowl and was named All Pro in 2006.

DAVID GARRARD - Garrard is the only quarterback the Jaguars have ever drafted that outperformed his expectation. He was picked in the 2003 NFL Draft in the fourth round and would go onto win the starting job in Jacksonville a couple of years later, started 76 games, threw for more than 16,000 yards and earned a second contract with the team.

JAGUARS DRAFT BUSTS:

LUKE JOECKEL - The second overall pick of the 2013 draft and the first pick of the Dave Caldwell era never worked out. This was not a star studded draft as we look back on it, but Joeckel was expected to be a cornerstone of the rebuild in Jacksonville and was gone by 2016 and now out of the NFL in 2019.

JUSTIN BLACKMON - From a talent standpoint, Justin Blackmon was not a bust because he could play football. Blackmon's troubles happened off the field. The sad story included a four game suspension in his second year for violating the league's substance abuse policy. After returning to action in 2013, he got suspended again and never played another NFL game. The Jaguars had traded up to get Blackmon in the 2012 Draft.

RELATED: 5 players the Jacksonville Jaguars might draft

BLAINE GABBERT - The Jaguars thought they had their franchise quarterback in 2011 when Gene Smith traded up for the young qb out of Missouri. Gabbert was thrown into action before he was ready to play and it never went well in Jacksonville. After 28 games in a Jaguars uniform, the team traded him to San Francisco. Gabbert is still a backup in the NFL never lived up to the franchise qb hopes. It also doesn't help that JJ Watt was the next pick behind Gabbert.

DERRICK HARVEY - The Jaguars thought they had the player to put them over the top and make a Super Bowl run in 2008 when they drafted Derrick Harvey. They likely drafted the biggest bust in team history. The Jags traded several picks to move up and get the pass rusher out of Florida. Harvey delivered 8 sacks in 47 games and was out of the NFL by the age of 26.

RJ SOWARD - This pick from the Coughlin coaching era was a lot like the Justin Blackmon selected from an off the field problems perspective. The 29th overall selection in the 2000 NFL Draft, Soward has alcohol related problems and would only play in 13 career games in the NFL.

888,"5th Avenue gestival to feature R&B singer Glenn Jones, authors","National recording artist Glenn Jones will headline the 40th annual 5th Avenue Arts Festival this weekend.

Nkwanda Jah, executive director of the Cultural Arts Coalition and a longtime festival organizer, said the festival is pleased to bring Jones to the festival.

“He is very popular,"" Jah said. ""Last week (two weeks ago) we put feelers out and we’re very pleased to get him.”

Last-minute funding made it possible to bring Jones to the festival, Jah said. He is set to perform on the main stage at 6:30 p.m. Saturday.

She said the biggest national headliners they’ve hosted at the festival have been R&B and soul artists, including the S.O.S. Band, The Delphonics and Regina Belle, a four-time Grammy winning R&B and pop singer.

The festival will be held from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Saturday and noon-5 p.m. Sunday at Northwest Sixth Street between Third and Seventh avenues. The emcee for the festival this year will be Alicia Hayes.

The festival's theme will be “Ujamaa,” which means “collective economics” in Swahili, a language spoken in the African Great Lakes region and other parts of eastern and southeastern Africa.

She said the festival will continue to address ongoing issues, including the lack of black-owned businesses and housing for the working poor.

New this year will be the ""Authors' Corner"" featuring a number of writers, including several with local ties.

Jah shared the history of the 5th Avenue festival, which is 40 and counting.

Jah said she was a participating in a poetry conference at UF when she was encouraged to host a poetry reading event. That first event grew into a festival to include artwork, music, dancing, barbecue for sale and speakers who talked about the perils of gentrification of the Fifth Avenue neighborhood. Electricity was provided by the late Aaron Young, from his barbershop. The event was held at what is now the Gainesville Community Redevelopment Agency parking lot on Northwest Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street.

Jah said there was a group of people who noticed the Fifth Avenue/Pleasant Street community was being gentrified, and the event served to bring awareness to what was happening in the neighborhood.

After five years, the festival moved from what is now the CRA parking lot to the T.B. McPherson Recreation Center in southeast Gainesville, where it remained two or three years. Although it was a good venue that allowed for more activities, Jah said they felt the 5th Avenue festival needed to return to the neighborhood. After a couple moves in that general area, the festival is now held on Sixth Street between Third and Seventh avenues.

Artists displaying and selling their artwork will include Alyne Harris, Destiny Henderson, Allah Gore of Miami, among others.

Besides Jones, the entertainment will feature local artists, including Passion Band, Uncle B’s Groove, Expressive Song and Dance led by Elois Waters, the Star Children’s Theatre, as well as local rappers and other artists. There will be gospel song and dance performances.

Children will have learn while engaging in science activities provided by the Cade Museum of Innovation and Invention and the Florida Museum of Natural History. Art activities will be provided by the Harn Museum of Art. Children also will enjoy a bounce house, clowns, stilt walkers and more.

Vendors will sell yard art, arts and crafts, jewelry, African musical instruments, African clothing, candles and more. Food vendors will also be on hand.

Jah, who for 39 years has served as festival chairperson, said she has passed the mantle to Courtney Scott, who this year served as festival chairman. Scott, a local artist, owns Rastafarice, a shaved ice business.

“We’re ready to have big headliners for the festival, but we need to have bigger fundraisers,” Jah said. “Courtney is bringing new ideas and young people and continuing the tradition.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190424/5th-avenue-gestival-to-feature-rampb-singer-glenn-jones-authors?rssfeed=true,2019-04-24T16:05:00Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
891,"If celebrity chef Tyler Florence is jittery in Fort Myers, it's Bennett's fault","CLOSE Five food trucks that appear to be competing in the Food Network show ""The Great Food Truck Race"" fed hungry fans during a May 21-22 visit to Oxnard. Here's a look at their menus, at which ""Jersey Shore"" star is competing with his Mom's recipes -- and at where they're headed next.

Food Network Chef Tyler Florence spent a morning at Bennett's Fresh Roast in Fort Myers. He left with, well, a lot of caffeine.

We'll have to watch the upcoming seasons of Food Network's ""The Great Food Truck Race"" extra close, to see if host Tyler Florence looks wired — like he's maybe just a tad over-caffeinated.

While no one has officially confirmed that the reality competition is taping in the Fort Myers area this week, several signs point to just that. A trio of out-of-town food trucks have been calling local breweries in recent days, hoping to secure spots at their venues.

And then there's Florence.

The celebrity chef and TV show host popped into Bennett's Fresh Roast in Fort Myers late Tuesday morning for a couple dozen doughnuts and a quadruple shot of espresso (that's right: quadruple).

""He's a big espresso fan,"" Bennett's owner Bob Grissinger said of the star.

""We made him an espresso with beans that we roasted right here just the night before. He ordered a quadruple, so he's doing some laps.""

Grissinger's shop, which was featured on Cooking Channel's ""Donut Showdown"" in 2013, has fed celebrities in the past. Actors Pauly Shore and Tom Green have stopped in, as has Florence's venerable Food Network colleague Alton Brown, who tweeted selfies with a cup of Bennett's coffee and one of its cinnamon-sugar doughnuts leading up to his February 2015 show at Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall.

Grissinger wasn't at Bennett's when Brown visited.

On Tuesday, he got lucky.

""Just out of the blue, he kind of came in and said, 'We checked around about doughnuts in Fort Myers and you guys are by far the most famous,'"" Grissinger said, laughing.

""The customers played it cool, but my staff went all goo-goo eyed. They just about lost it.""

Unlike Brown, who came and left with little fanfare, Grissinger said Florence brought in his crew to shoot some footage for an online-only special promoting ""The Great Food Truck Race.""

Of the many doughnuts Florence took with him, Grissinger said the maple-bacon topped with thick rashers of Nueske's bacon seemed to excite him most.

""He knows Nueske’s, so he was excited, he was like, 'Oh my God, that’s the best bacon in the world.'""

Grissinger said the celebrity chef was kind and charming, and that the meeting helped make up for missing out on Alton Brown.

""I kind of kicked myself for that, so this was like my do-over.""

And if Florence is a bit high-strung and jittery on the next season of ""The Great Food Truck Race?""

""I'll take the credit,"" Grissinger said with another laugh, ""or the blame.""

892,There's tons of family fun with art and music in the parks this weekend,"The Acevedo girls and cousin Evelyn Gilpin, standing, get to play with the baby chicks, courtesy of Daleen Gilpin. (Photo: Alicea Acevedo)

Each spring my sister’s mother-in-law, Daleen Gilpin, has chicks in her kindergarten classroom and we like to go see them before they start flying around. After they hatch in the incubator in her room, her students get to watch them grow for about 10 days, then it's off to live on the farm where they came from.

The girls love to hold them and this year my niece, who is 19 months old, got to check them out, too. (They all did a great job not squeezing them too tight.) Daleen is retiring this May after 22 years at Celebration Baptist, so our chick visiting days are sadly over.

We are looking forward to a couple other spring traditions going on this weekend, including two of our favorite festivals. Downtown will be hopping!

Art for all and all for art

The LeMoyne Chain of Parks Art Festival is this weekend, and we can’t wait. We have always had a great time checking out the 170 artists and their booths (except when my husband bought a $700 painting without discussing it with me first, but that’s a story for another time), the live music, food trucks, adult beverages for sale, and the best part for kids: the Children’s Pop-Up Studios.

Last year we set up a blanket near the kids area and took turns at the tables with the girls while the rest of us sat and enjoyed the festival. The kids tables included different crafts, musical instruments to play, bubbles and lots of other fun stuff to keep the kids entertained. This year there is also a free concert for all from 5 to 7 p.m. Saturday.

Details: Chain of Parks, Park Avenue between Monroe and Meridian. The festival is 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The Children’s Studios will be run all day Saturday and noon to 3 p.m. Sunday. Admission is free.

It’s PRIDE time

PrideFest is going on all week in town, and Pride on the Plaza is its premier event. This family-friendly free fest is one we look forward to all year. There will be entertainment all afternoon on the main stage, food and other vendors throughout and a Kids Zone, sure to keep the young Pride-goers busy and having fun with a bounce house, art activity, shaved ice and pet adoptions.

Details: Noon to 5:30 p.m. Saturday at Kleman Plaza. It's free.

Just get fit

Benefiting the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Big Bend, there will be two races including obstacle courses at the Just Get Fit Hidden Hill Challenge on Saturday morning. The first race begins at 8 a.m. and will include a one-mile fun run with obstacles on the way. The second race starts promptly at 8:30 a.m., and participants will complete as many laps of the course as they can in 60 minutes. While both races are open to anyone (including adults), the first course is designed for kids aged 6-12 and the second for 12 and older. Obstacles include tire flipping, sandbag and bucket carry, and the cool sounding “frozen finish.” Following the races there will be a health and fitness fair until noon.

Details: Saturday from 8 a.m. to noon, Just Get Fit, 2760 Capital Circle NE. The cost is $15 in advance, $18 day of. Register at justgetfit.fitness.

Pops in the Park

The Tallahassee Symphony Orchestra will present a Pops in the Park concert overlooking Southwood’s Central Park Lake on Saturday evening. This is a great opportunity to introduce the kids to an orchestra, and the park setting is much more forgiving of little ones who can't sit still. (In fact, it's pretty common to see kids dancing to the music.) Dine on a picnic supper, either brought from home or purchased on site. Blankets, chairs and coolers are welcome.

Details: The gates open at 6 p.m. Saturday, with showtime at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $9.99 in advance and $15 at the door. Kids 10 and under are free. Purchase at tallahasseesymphony.org. Parking is limited, so a shuttle is available at the Southwood Town Center, 3197 Merchants Row Blvd.

893,Local contractors given opportunity to rebuild housing at Tyndall Air Force Base,"Local contractors given opportunity to rebuild housing at Tyndall Air Force Base Video

TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE -- More than 800 homes were damaged in Hurricane Michael at Tyndall Air Force Base. Balfour Beatty Communities owns and responsible for repairing over 500 of them.

The company is hoping to hire local contracting companies to repair the interior of the homes.

Richard Cole, Project Manager, said, ""we're doing is asking them to put together their bids to return these homes to a liveable state.""

On Tuesday, the company invited interested local contractors to the base to give them an outline of what the work will consist of.

""There are about 37 homes in the Island View neighborhood. Senior officers live in this neighborhood and we've pretty much got this neighborhood set first cause we're able to do the interior demolition on it,"" said Cole.

Cole says there are a couple of reasons they want to hire local businesses for the interior work. The main reason is supporting the local economy but it's also cost effective. ""And secondly, it's a cost issue. If we're able to have the local workforce, qualified Florida contractors to come in here and do the work, then we don't have to pay that extra burden for them to come in and get housing and the extra per diem costs that come along with it.""

He says this week's meeting is just the first of many and they will go through the same process when they're ready to tackle the other neighborhoods.

Cole says they hope to have the contracts completed in the next 30 days with the companies they select.

The company is hosting another meeting on Wednesday, April 24.

Contractors interested in pursuing opportunities at Tyndall AFB Homes should contact Balfour Beatty Communities Procurement Project Manager Geoff Hutcherson at TyndallRFP@bbcgrp.com to obtain the Request for Proposal package and indicate their desire to attend a site visit.

Pre-registration is required and in keeping with security procedures, contractors who show up without registering will not be allowed on the base for the visits.

Balfour Beatty Communities is looking for a wide variety of professional contractors, with services including:

Drywall

Insulation

Flooring

Siding

Finish carpentry

Finish electrical

HVAC

Plumbing

Countertops

Cabinets

The deadline to submit bids is May 10, 2019.

894,Neighbors near Cape Coral shooting wary after Monday incident,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Lee County on news-press.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

Residents near a Monday shooting said they are ""uneasy"" in the day following the incident, describing the neighborhood as quiet.

Meanwhile Cape Coral police continued investigating what they are calling a targeted shooting that left one person with multiple gunshot wounds.

The shooting was reported to police shortly before 3:30 p.m. Monday at 1013 SE 24th Ave. They found a man at the back of the home, lying on a table outside.

Cape Coral police are investigating what they say was a targeted shooting at a home on SE 24th Avenue on Monday. (Photo: Michael Braun/news-press.com)

Police said they believe the shooting was targeted but could not say if the victim knew the perpetrator.

A heavily redacted police report indicated witnesses described a Honda sedan containing ""three or four"" people who were responsible for the shooting.

The report also had witnesses suggesting a drug transaction could have been an issue.

Neighbors along SE 24th said they pretty much keep to themselves with little interaction between neighbors.

Most of those who answered their doors in the vicinity of the shooting declined to be identified and said they don't know their neighbors.

""I didn't see anything,"" said Janet Rochford, who lives across the street from the shooting site. ""We don't know anyone over there.""

Rochford said that the area is usually quiet, but there have been a few thefts which prompted some residents to put in surveillance cameras.

June Presly, who lives next door to where the shooting occurred, said she and her kids were home but all she heard was a loud banging.

""I thought someone had hit the wall, the 6-year resident of Southeast 24th said. ""Then I came outside. I thought our kayak fell over. We usually stay in our cocoon. The kids usually call me if there's trouble.""

Presly said she does not know the residents at 1013 except that they've lived there about a year.

""It's a younger couple,"" she said.

Two men and a woman with bright red hair entered the home Tuesday shortly after noon but would not come to the door.

One woman a few doors down, who has lived at the same SE 24th Street duplex for 35 years, said the street is usually a quiet place.

""I didn't hear a thing,"" Helen Dienst said. ""It's a little unnerving.""

896,Aucilla Christian softball playing for complete game amid rebuilding season,"After going to the Class 2A state championship game the past five years, the Warriors have just one win this spring with four regular-season games left

Buy Photo Aucilla Christian seventh-grader Emma Vickers pitches as NFC beat Aucilla Christian 15-5 on Tuesday, April 16, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

State champs in 2015 and 2016 by a combined score of 24-0. State runner-up in 2014, 2017 and 2018 – all one-run losses.

Aucilla Christian’s softball team has had a five-year run of dominance that few will match. It’s fair to call that span a dynasty.

Dynasties end, however. The question is when.

With a 1-11 record this year as powerful Madison County (17-4) heads to Aucilla for a Tuesday afternoon game, the Warriors are in an unfamiliar rebuilding phase.

SOFTBALL PREVIEW: 'Go big or go home' for loaded, experienced Madison County

“It really is fun working with the younger ones,” eighth-year Aucilla coach Becky Brandies said. “Yes, we’re going to have to rebuild, but everyone does. It’s fundamentals. The younger ones will eventually be the next seniors.”

Buy Photo Aucilla Christian shortstop Ali Townsend looks on during the middle of a timeout as NFC beat Aucilla Christian 15-5 on Tuesday, April 16, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

For the past five years, the Warriors have had pitching in spades, which is probably the biggest key to sustaining success in softball.

Five years ago, senior Whitney Stevens guided a young group that had eighth-graders Elizabeth Hightower and Abigail Morgan. We now know how that turned out.

Hightower became All-Big Bend Pitcher of the Year as a freshman and is now at the University of Florida. She’s already been named SEC Freshman of the Week after a complete-game shutout of No. 14 Arkansas.

Morgan became a two-time All-Big Bend Player of the Year. She’s now playing at Florida Atlantic.

Key position players around them have graduated and are playing college ball now, too.

What remains is one senior – catcher Ashlyn Rogers – surrounded by three middle-schoolers, three freshmen, three sophomores and two juniors. Aside from Rogers, only three from that group played significantly last year and only one – sophomore Lindsey Davis – had initial success at the varsity level.

“It’s nice to be a senior, but at the same time it’s hard – you have to be a leader even when you lose a lot,” said Rogers, who is hitting .625 with three home runs and 15 RBI. “You can’t have a frown on your face because you have to set an example for the younger girls.”

There’s nothing nonchalant about practices this year. Brandies – whose first year at Aucilla was spent taking lumps with a sixth-grader as the Warriors’ only pitcher – is teaching the basics until whenever practice is over.

“Whenever we practice, we try not to play around,” Rogers said. “We’re doing fundamental drills to make us better. We have to bust our butts at practice and at games hope for the best.”

Said Brandies: “It’s not that we lack talent, these girls just have always had someone else to lead them – Carly (Joiner), Kelly (Horne), Abigail, Elizabeth – and now they don’t know their role and how to step in and train the younger ones.”

Buy Photo Aucilla Christian softball coach Becky Brandies as NFC beat Aucilla Christian 15-5 on Tuesday, April 16, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Rogers has pitched a few innings this year, but Brandies is really trying to bring along Davis, eighth-grader Lena Kimmell, and seventh-grader Emma Vickers.

Opponents are batting .297 against Aucilla and are being gifted 10 free bases per game via walks and hit batters. On top of that, the Warriors’ fielding percentage is just .808. That means when runners are on, mistakes are compounding the run differential.

“We’re good usually until about the fourth inning and then we’ll have two outs and can’t get out,” Brandies said. “With two outs, we seem to make so many errors. They just start finding holes and it falls apart. It’s desperately wanting out of something and then you don’t make routine plays. You try to overcompensate when you want an out that badly.”

Buy Photo Aucilla Christian second baseman Esther Fulford reacts after dropping a pop up as NFC beat Aucilla Christian 15-5 on Tuesday, April 16, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Aucilla has hit at a pretty good clip, a .325 team average. In addition to Rogers, Davis has picked up where she left off last year, bumping her average up from .380 to .500 with a couple home runs. Kimmell is hitting .379, while eighth-grader Ali Townsend (.478) and freshman Isabella Gray (.428) are both squaring up balls with regularity.

But the Warriors need to do more than hit with the top half of their lineup to win.

“I just want to see us play the way I know we can play,” Rogers said. “We have a really young team and sometimes we act scared. It’s just not being used to the game. I just want to see us play the way I know we can because we’ve definitely gotten better since the beginning of the season.”

The Warriors have four regular-season games remaining. They may very well only win the last one against FAMU DRS, the only opponent they’ve beaten this season and a district opponent they have never lost to.

“I’m staying positive with everything,” Brandies said. “Sure, we make errors, but they know. I’ve pointed it out so many times. And they know themselves. We’ve started to hold them accountable individually. ‘What could you have done differently in that game?’ Then try to carry that over to the next game and do it differently.”

Though regular-season wins may be hard to come by, Aucilla Christian will have a postseason chance as a result of being in a two-team district.

When reclassification happens next year, its district won’t be so easy to get out of. But by then, Brandies hopes this year’s rebuild has taken shape.

Despite this year’s struggles, the Warriors’ region is not that challenging. It’s quite possible they could still make a state tournament.

And with a couple well-pitched and well-defended games, Aucilla could add its name to the record books yet again.

“They do a whole lot of things right,” Brandies said. “It’s the things defensively that we don’t do right that cost us. I’m proud of them for the things they do right, and we’ll continue to work on the things we don’t do right.

“And hopefully we’ll play a complete ballgame soon.”",http://rssfeeds.tallahassee.com/~/601071858/0/tallahassee/home~Aucilla-Christian-softball-playing-for-complete-game-amid-rebuilding-season/,2019-04-22T11:25:08Z,Tallahassee Democrat,Couple,"277 N Magnolia Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA",FL,32301

Pushing strollers and waving “Shut it down ” signs, demonstrators flocked to Cape Coral Wednesday to protest the detention of more than 2,000 migrant children at a for-profit facility in Homestead, the country’s largest and still growing.

It's not the first time the diverse group of Southwest Floridians have mobilized in the name of reuniting migrant families -- last year they joined a national outcry against family separations. Nor, they say, will it be the last.

""Our mission is not political, it is humanitarian,"" said Susan Schroeder of Pine Island ROAR (Rise up, Organize, Activate, Resist). ""Asylum is legal. We want the children to be released.""

Located two hours from Cape Coral near Miami, Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children was supposed to be as its name implies -- temporary -- when it opened on a defunct Job Corps site in 2016 to house an unexpected influx of Central American migrant children.

Instead, the Trump administration is expanding its capacity for the second time this year to hold over 3,000 kids ages 13 to 17, making it a target of human rights groups around the country.

“It’s the only private, for-profit center of its kind, and they are making money off of holding these kids there.” Nancy Terrari, Lee County NOW organizer

The children cross the border bearing contact information for a family member willing to sponsor them as they seek asylum in this country, but the re-unification process is tenuous and takes too long, critics say.

“What worries us most is it’s a private center so there is no transparency,” said Nancy Terreri, a member of Lee County’s NOW chapter. “It’s the only private, for-profit center of its kind, and they are making money off of holding these kids there.”

Because it sits on federal land, the center doesn’t have to meet Florida licensing or education standards or be inspected by state or local officials.

“Last year there were over 1,400 sexual assaults (at migrant child detention centers around the country),” said Democratic Progressive Club of Lee County organizer Steve Sherman, “yet there are no legal inspections. Their parents sent them to live with relatives so they can grow up in a better world, and we don’t know what’s happening to them.”

The Department of Health and Human Services denied access last week to three South Florida congresswomen wanting to tour the facility, despite a recent law passed for that purpose, they said.

A concerned Fort Myers couple, Patricia and Blaise Onelio, traveled to Homestead last week to join Witness: Tornio. Target: Homestead, a group that stands watch over the facility to let the contractor know the world is watching.

After successfully protesting the detention of unaccompanied migrant children in Texas, a small witness group has turned its attention to Homestead, FL, where the largest for-profit detention center for migrant children is expanding under federal contract. Protestors from around the country, including, on Tuesday, Cape Coral, are rallying around the action group Witness: Tornillo.

“It was good and it was sad because there’s not a lot you can do,” Patricia Onelio said of her visit. “But you have to bear witness. If no one is there, atrocious things can happen.

“If no one is there, atrocious things can happen.” Patricia Onelio, Fort Myers

Although tiny, a similar rally was instrumental in the closure of another temporary facility in Tornillo, Texas that sprung up with Trump’s ‘zero tolerance’ policy.

“Tornillo grew to about 3,000 kids before it closed,” said Josh Rubin, a software developer who planted himself outside that facility for three months last year, drawing national attention to it.

“Scale is one of the things that makes it terrible.” Joshua Rubin, Witness: Tornillo organizer

""We were blown away that he and a few others have dedicated so much of their lives to helping these kids,"" said Onelio, who met Rubin in Homestead.

In his six weeks there, the Brooklyn, New York native has reported kids packed like sardines in bunks, mold in buildings damaged by Hurricane Irma and a spurt of job fairs, tents and mobile shelters to handle 1,000 more children.

“Scale is one of the things that makes it terrible,” Rubin said. “They decided to shut Tornillo down because it couldn’t be sustained. I don’t rule out the same thing could happen in Homestead.”

Homes instead of detention

A federal court agreement, called the Flores settlement, sets standards for how migrant youth are treated, including a maximum holding period of 20 days if needed, but Homestead is exempt, HHS claims, because it’s temporary.

“These kids are held an average of 56 days, and we know some have been there over four to six months,” Terreri said.

A Miami artist-activist who advocates for the children, Alessandra Mondolfi says detention is no different from the Trump administration’s short-lived family separation policy of last year.

“It’s separation by another name,” said Mondolfi, who’s flashing signs light up the sides of the facility with slogans like ‘shut it down’ and ‘homes instead.

“It’s separation by another name.” Alessandra Mondolfi, artist-activist

“They come here with uncles, grandparents, a brother or sister, and they are separated,” she said.

One challenge of keeping family units together is the difficulty of proving they’re related, Terreri said. Another is that some sponsoring relatives fear deportation if they come forward to claim a child.

But it doesn’t matter how the center treats them, the human rights watchers say.

“They have not committed a crime. They should not be there, period,” Mondolfi said.

Terreri and another Fort Myers resident, Suzanne Summit, were headed to Homestead Thursday to stand watch.

ROAR members -- a group of some 300 Southwest Floridians who first organized to promote the 2017 Women's March on Washington -- say they’re trying to fill a minivan to make their own visit.

““It seems more of us should be sharing the burden,” Onelio agreed, describing how her husband and other witnesses stood on step ladders to see over the facility’s eight-foot fence.

“The boys who were outside waved to him,” she said. “They seemed grateful that we were there.”

More rallies are planned in Lee County and Homestead on Mother’s Day.

901,"Edgewater woman, 97, recalls torture, abuse in Nazi concentration camps","Through a small square in the side of a boxcar cramped with human cargo, 22-year-old Elsie Ragusin watched the cities of Central Europe pass in and out of view.

The smell of human waste hung heavy in the thick heat. Hunger blurred her vision.

For five days in August 1944, the train traveled from northern Italy to Vienna, east to Budapest and up across Czechoslovakia and into Poland — no food, no water and no reprieve for its passengers.

Ragusin dared not budge from her place beside the sole source of fresh air and sunlight.

“If you moved, you’re afraid to be trampled,” Ragusin said. “I couldn’t squat down or anything.”

Ragusin was in shock.

What’s going on? Why am I being held?

“It was horrible. I couldn’t understand what was happening,” said Ragusin, now 97 and living in Edgewater. “I was stunned most of the time.”

Earlier that spring, German troops occupied Lussino, twin Italian isles off the Croatian coast where Ragusin was visiting her grandparents.

Nazi soldiers entered their home and demanded Ragusin and her father accompany them for questioning on suspicions of spying for the Allies.

She languished in jail cells for weeks, and then was put on a train bound, she thought, for factory work in Germany. That still seemed a possibility five days later when she stepped off the train in front of a hall with huge doors.

But several hours later when she entered a brick barracks lined with overcrowded bunks, she finally realized.

This was no factory.

Ragusin had arrived at Auschwitz, a sprawling death camp complex in Poland to which the Nazis deported more than 1.3 million people during Adolf Hitler’s regime.

Prisoners were shipped to Auschwitz from all over Europe. Most were Jews. Some were political dissidents. Others belonged to ethnic or social groups Hitler sought to eradicate.

But as far as Ragusin knew, she was the only American.

A sudden shift

From the deck of an Italian steamship, Ragusin (pronounced Ra-gu-ZEEN) gazed with eager eyes on majestic Mediterranean palaces and centuries-old monuments she’d only imagined in her native New York.

It was her third transatlantic voyage, but the first she was old enough to appreciate.

Soon after she was born on Nov. 4, 1921, her parents, Giovanni and Domenica Ragusin, took Elsie and her three older brothers to Lussino, their ancestral homeland, to meet the rest of the family.

But on this 1939 trip, 17 years old and fresh out of high school, Ragusin was mesmerized by every port they passed. Lisbon, Barcelona, Genoa, Corfu, Venice — each city enchanted her further.

Her fantasy continued when she arrived with her mother and father at her family’s seaside villa on Lussinpiccolo, the smaller of the Lussino islands. Their stay extended several years to care for her aging grandparents.

Ragusin explored castles, joined a theater group, assisted university students with English language compositions and fell for a striking 22-year-old navy captain named Toni Rocchi.

Neighbors called her the “most beautiful girl on the island” and numerous men sought her hand in marriage. But she had eyes only for Toni.

They danced on the moonlit shore, reveled at romantic military balls and took walks along the waterfront under their families’ watchful eyes.

“I had the love of my life in Europe,” Ragusin said. “He was a beautiful, kind man.”

He didn’t officially propose — the looming war cast a long shadow of uncertainty — but he asked her to wait for him. It was all the assurance she needed. “I knew I was his, you know, and that was it,” she said.

Toni was called to active duty on a warship in 1941, and the idyllic future she foresaw was snatched away.

Unjust imprisonment

At first, it seemed like a simple misunderstanding.

Soon after German forces occupied Lussino in spring 1944, two Nazi soldiers entered her grandparents’ home and accused Ragusin and her father of signaling Allied aircraft with cigarettes. Her mother and extended family were not implicated.

“I never smoked in my life,” Ragusin said. “(They said) we were spies, and that never happened. And then they were saying, too, that we were Jews, and that didn’t work out because we were Roman Catholic.”

Perhaps someone pointed the Nazis toward her and her father to spare their own life or curry favor with the occupying army. She still doesn’t know.

The soldiers ordered them to pack suitcases — they would be detained for a night or two until they could be interrogated.

But days stretched into weeks. They were shifted to other cities, other prisons. Ragusin’s father explained to authorities that it was all a big mistake. Instead of being freed, they were fingerprinted and separated.

Ragusin was moved to Trieste, in a northeastern nook of mainland Italy, and jailed with female political prisoners in a filthy, rat-infested cell. There, the seriousness of her situation set in.

Prisoners were selected for execution at random. Ragusin heard the screams of those who were tortured. The survivors returned with harrowing accounts of barbaric brutality.

She found hope in rumors that they might be sent by train to Germany. After so long in a prison cell, even the thought of forced labor seemed an escape.

At the station, she saw a familiar face among men being herded from one train to another.

“I saw my father and oh — that beautiful face,” Ragusin said. “I ran to him and he spotted me and ran to me and we embraced.”

A German soldier tore them apart, spat insults and shoved them into separate lines.

“He was put on one train, which went somewhere, I didn’t know where, and I was put in another,” she said. “And that was the last time I saw my father.”

‘Nothing but bones’

Five numbers tattooed on Ragusin’s forearm have faded with time, but her memory of the moment they were inked remains fresh.

Ragusin already was within the walls of Auschwitz when the train came to a stop at the end of her transcontinental trek from Trieste.

She hadn’t eaten, drunk, slept or sat down for five days.

The boxcar door slid open, and the bodies of those who perished on the journey tumbled out. The survivors waited on a platform for hours to enter a large hall that led into what she discovered later was a gas chamber.

Their suitcases were taken first, next their garments and then their dignity.

“I never took my clothes off in front of (anyone) — never,” Ragusin said. “And here I was naked in front of all these people. I think I died several times. I was so humiliated.”

She begged to keep her gold necklace with its cross pendant, her gold watch and a ring, a graduation gift from her parents. “You don’t need them here,” she recalled a guard’s cold reply.

They shaved her body and cropped her long, brown hair. She was sprayed with water — first scalding, then freezing — and doused with insecticide. The women lined up again, still naked, for officers to assess.

Women huddled together for warmth and were beaten for it. One fell to the floor in front of Ragusin, bleeding from a gash on her head.

“But you can’t pick them up,” she said. “You can’t do anything, you just have to stay there and look.”

A high-ranking Nazi officer she later learned was Adolf Eichmann, whom Hitler tasked with coordinating the Jews’ extermination, decided their fate with a flick of his finger.

“He'd mark you: Go this way or that way,” Ragusin said. “It meant those (sent to one side) are to go to work, and those (pointed to the other) will be killed.”

Those selected for labor had a number tattooed atop their left forearms. Ragusin no longer had a name. She was 82384.

She received one damp, smelly blue-and-gray dress, but no undergarments or shoes.

Prisoners slept in muddy barracks lined with rows of bunk beds. Seven to 10 people squeezed on their sides into each bunk with one blanket between them.

“When you open a can of sardines, they’re this way and that way — that’s how it was with people,” Ragusin said. “How could you ever sleep?”

She covered her face with her hands at night to protect it from being kicked.

They were roused daily at 2 or 3 a.m. for roll call. Many collapsed and died, too weak to stand at attention for hours in the rain or snow until the count was correct. The rest went to work.

A sign on the camp gate in German stated “Arbeit macht frei” — work sets you free — but Ragusin couldn’t read it.

She mixed cement, chopped wood and laid bricks to build more barracks. Her arms bled from carrying rocks and pushing heavy carts laden with sand and boulders. She sometimes worked all day and night with no rest.

“It was so atrocious, so hard to believe the things that were happening,” Ragusin said. “You never could imagine all the beatings and everything else.”

Guards struck her more than once as punishment for not working fast enough. One whipped her so hard across her left ear that she lost hearing.

She refused to show weakness.

“I was afraid that if they see that I’m hurting, they might shoot me,” she said, so she tucked her bloody face into her shoulder and kept going. “I never heard (out of that ear) again.”

Food was scant, and sanitation was nonexistent.

The latrine — if there was time to use it — was a row of holes in the ground, out in the open. Breakfast was a mug of ground beans.

“And then later, coming home (after work) for supper, we had a piece of black bread — very hard, which I broke my tooth on — a piece of margarine, a piece of some kind of bologna. But that was it,” Ragusin said.

Disease was rampant. Body lice spread typhus fever. Dysentery was common, and feces-contaminated drinking water induced typhoid.

“We were starving and thirsty because you knew if you drink the water, you’re gone,” Ragusin said.

She went barefoot for weeks until she bartered some bread for mismatched, holey shoes from a prisoner who worked unloading luggage from incoming transports. She stuffed scraps of paper and trash into the slits to keep the mud out.

Days and dates were meaningless. Her 23rd birthday passed, but she had no notion of it. Her withering body was the only means of measurement.

“I was a skeleton,” Ragusin said. “My face was sunk and my legs, my arms — just bones. Nothing but bones.”

She felt utterly alone. “I had no friends because you can’t trust anybody,” she said. “Who put you there? You don’t know. You can’t believe anybody.”

During the several months Ragusin estimates she spent at Auschwitz, she watched desperate prisoners grab the camp’s electric fence to kill themselves. Others tried to escape and were hanged. But she still held on to hope.

‘A lot to live for’

She’d always been strong-willed.

At age 2 or 3, Ragusin wandered away from her family’s Lussino home. Her panicked mother searched among the nearby shops until she found some men singing and drinking wine. One had Ragusin on his knee, singing along.

To forestall any further adventures, her mother took her sandals away, sure that Ragusin wouldn’t walk barefoot down the rocky path leading toward town. Her mother was wrong.

“Sure enough, I went there again without shoes,” Ragusin said. “I was a little rebel.”

Her innate perseverance kept her alive, but the waning days of the war tested her resilience more than ever.

As Allied forces approached Auschwitz in January 1945, she was shipped west by train to Ravensbrück, an all-female camp in northeast Germany.

It was as if the whole horrible nightmare was rewound and played again: a 400-mile journey in an overburdened boxcar during the heart of winter, the same humiliating intake process and selection. Only Ravensbrück was even worse than Auschwitz.

A colored cloth triangle on each woman’s uniform depicted why she was imprisoned. Jews wore a yellow triangle. Ragusin’s was red — designating her a political prisoner.

“I was so angry,” she said, still incensed at the injustice of it all. “I did nothing wrong.”

She traded a day’s supper for a needle and thread and sewed “USA” onto her red patch in defiance. Guards never confronted her about it.

She was quarantined for almost a month with hardly any food and infected sores spread over her body.

Once she was released into the general population, she worked in factories making parts for bombs, sawed down trees and dug holes in the forest. The prisoners on duty when the holes were deep enough were shot and shoved in.

People around her constantly died or disappeared, hauled away in trucks and never seen again.

A tooth once caused her such pain that she couldn’t work. Guards pulled it with pliers and no anesthesia. “I thought my whole insides were being taken out,” she said.

Even that was better than being taken to the medical ward, where “unthinkable” things happened.

Josef Mengele, a German physician who became known as the “angel of death,” subjected some prisoners to grotesque and inhumane procedures.

Ragusin underwent frequent “examinations,” she said. Women would be made to stand naked in front of large windows to be X-rayed and injected with unknown substances.

“You see the doctors standing there watching,” she said. “You have to parade in front of them. If you could, you could have just stabbed and killed them. Many times that’s how I felt. But you had to keep your sanity and keep on going, just be strong.”

Some experiments — cruel attempts at sterilization — were too graphic to describe in detail.

She remembers six doctors in white uniforms holding down her head, arms and feet, and then excruciating pain.

Her mind flashed to her fiance, Toni, and she mourned her lost innocence. She thought of her mother and father, her brothers back in New York and her Catholic faith.

“When they let me out that time, I said, ‘God, I want you to make a hole and put me right down there,’” Ragusin said. “I wanted him to bury me. I was so embarrassed, so ashamed. I didn’t want to live anymore for what they did.”

But she longed to see her family and Toni again. And so, as she had done so many days before, she summoned the courage to carry on.

“I kept on fighting all the time. Because I did want to live. I didn’t want to die then,” she said. “I thought, ‘I have a lot to live for.’”

The Swedish Red Cross arrived at Ravensbrück on April 24, 1945. And not a moment too soon. The Nazis had begun locking prisoners in and setting their barracks on fire. Ragusin heard hers was next.

She was taken to Sweden and later Denmark to recover and returned to the U.S. in late December 1945.

Her mother hid out in Italy until the war ended and came home to New York in 1947. Her father perished in Buchenwald concentration camp. Toni was killed in battle, and her youthful dreams died with him.

But 10 years later, she had a son. His father looked just like Toni.

‘God always saved me’

Ragusin has lived 1,170 months. She spent just 10 of them in Nazi jails and camps.

She has three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. She wrote a book. She loved and lost other men.

But she never recovered what those 10 months took from her.

She wasn’t a soldier, but she did go to war. She has no pension to show for it.

Ragusin resides alone in a retirement community, struggling to survive on her Social Security stipend. She relies on the Council on Aging of Volusia County to supply her with meals several times a week.

The same questions she grappled with at 22 have haunted her for 70 years.

“God always saved me in the camp,” Ragusin said. But why? Why was she there? Why is she here now?

She settles on two reasons. The first is her son, who lives with his wife a few doors down.

The other is her testimony.

Two years ago, a married couple asked Ragusin to meet their teenage daughter, who had fallen in with Nazi extremists and begun preaching their ideology in internet videos: The Holocaust was a hoax. Those sent to camps had plenty of food and spent their time relaxing in swimming pools.

Ragusin met with the girl and shared all she’d endured.

“Later, she called (me) and she said, ‘You saved my life,’” Ragusin said. “I think that’s why maybe I’m here.”

'Never forget'

The Holocaust survivors’ rallying cry has long been “never forget.”

As the youngest survivors age into their 70s, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., makes a special effort to preserve firsthand accounts in order to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike.

To honor this week's Days of Remembrance, established by Congress as the nation’s annual Holocaust commemoration, The News-Journal is sharing the individual accounts of four local Holocaust survivors.

Aimee Rubensteen, the museum's acquisitions coordinator, travels South Florida “rescuing the evidence of the Holocaust by speaking to firsthand witnesses,” she said, and collecting their World War II-era photos, letters, newspaper clippings, clothing and other artifacts of historical value — including the red triangle patch on which Elsie Ragusin sewed ""USA"" during her time in a German concentration camp.

“These original artifacts will be the things that teach the Holocaust to future generations,” Rubensteen said.

The museum’s mission is to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike and to encourage critical thinking about how and why those atrocities occurred.

Firsthand stories make those larger themes more personal.

“A lot of people don’t know about these specific, individual stories. The more we spread the word and expand the conversation, the better it is for everyone,” Rubensteen said.

Individuals or families who are interested in sharing their Holocaust artifacts or family keepsakes with the museum may contact Rubensteen at 786-496-2788 or arubensteen@ushmm.org to schedule an appointment.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190427/edgewater-woman-97-recalls-torture-abuse-in-nazi-concentration-camps?rssfeed=true,2019-04-27T19:37:47Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
902,"After nearly 32 years at South Daytona, Joe Yarbrough to see out sales tax vote","Come May 22, Joe Yarbrough will have more free time to go out on a fishing boat with a couple of beers and drift as far away from government offices as he likes.

No worries. No phone calls to answer. No more complaints from residents or elected officials.

Until then, though, the former city manager of South Daytona, who actually retired more than a month ago after three decades on the job, has to see something through that he started nearly five years ago.

When the ballots are mailed out next week for a special election on a half-cent sales tax that would raise money for road and water infrastructure projects throughout Volusia County, the final countdown on Yarbrough's government service will begin — and the results of the May 21 tally will determine if his final send-off includes a victory lap.

Yarbrough, 67, is already viewed as a role model to other city managers who came on after he arrived. And he's beloved by the residents who appreciate his folksy charm and attention to public service, including one who tells of the time the manager rushed to his house to look after a child who had accidentally eaten glass.

After a more than 40-year career in the public sector, Yarbrough's profile has never been higher. It was he who over the past five years relentlessly lobbied and cajoled leaders at Volusia's 16 cities to unite behind the sales tax push, which he has joked more than once may be the first time they've agreed on anything.

But no matter the outcome of the tax, Yarbrough has no intention of leaving his home in South Daytona, where he lives with his wife, Bobbie, and where he raised two sons. Gabriel, 37, works as a chemist with the city of Daytona Beach, while Joey is currently a doctor working a residency in Shreveport, Louisiana. At 27, he's about the age his father was when he took his first city manager gig.

Yarbrough, a University of Tennessee alum, started in the mountain tourist town of Gatlinburg — when Jimmy Carter was in the White House. Then one of the youngest city managers in the country, Yarbrough would often struggle to fall asleep, worried that he’d messed up somehow or let down his residents, employees.

While his sleep got better through the years, he still encountered restless nights from time to time even after he came to South Daytona in 1986 and became one of the longest-serving managers in Florida.

""It's probably good that I've been that way,"" Yarbrough said from his home on a recent Friday afternoon. ""It got a little bit better, but I never really got rid of that, I don't think. It kept me from getting lackadaisical. I don't want to disappoint those who hired me, and I certainly didn't want to disappoint the community.""

Even post-retirement, he expects that insomnia to return maybe to an even greater degree in the coming weeks as he anxiously awaits the sales tax verdict. Unlike his managerial decisions and policies, this is completely out of his hands. He's done all he can do.

Either way, he said, ""I probably won't sleep much the night before the election.""

'Too much credit'

Yarbrough is quick to downplay his role and deflect praise toward the city employees who work alongside him.

He will admit, though, that uniting Volusia's cities on the sales tax push was one of the toughest things he's done. And if he weren't so humble, the Tennessee man and son of a newspaper reporter would probably call it one of his most significant achievements.

Others see it that way. The effort took him five years, several failed attempts, a lot of negotiating, and more than a little Southern charm.

With his drawl, ""he knows how to relate to people in a way that doesn’t come across as threatening,"" said Michael Pleus, who has worked for the city of DeLand since 2000 and was named its manager in 2008. ""He helps people understand the importance of working together.""

Pleus now has ""big shoes to fill"" as he's been tabbed to take over as chair of the Volusia Manager's Association, a role Yarbrough has held for decades.

It was in that capacity that Yarbrough worked behind the scenes to win manager approval for the sales tax, which was required before elected officials could come on board by adopting a resolution and before it could be placed on a ballot. But Yarbrough doesn't want credit for any of it.

""As chair of the managers, I felt it was going to fall on me if I didn't do it,"" he said, adding that his primary job was to facilitate cooperation among cities. ""I did not do anything; they (other managers) did it. All I did was peddle it, and I get too much credit for that.""

Ormond Beach Manager Joyce Shanahan said Yarbrough deserves credit.

""One of Joe’s greatest strengths is getting communities to collaborate with one another. He’s continually championed the motto that we are always more successful working together than trying to go it alone,"" Shanahan said. ""Joe’s continuously been the boundless advocate for the profession and a skillful professional. I, for one, have learned lots from him.”

Howard Tipton, a former Daytona Beach city manager who now lives in Port Orange, knows how challenging it is to get 17 government entities to join forces for a cause. He advocated for consolidating fire services in 2011, but failed to convince his peers even while armed with a study that showed the idea would save money and be more efficient.

""It’s very difficult to get the county manager and all the cities to come together to agree on anything, "" Tipton said. ""He (Yarbrough) has done a yeoman's job leading this effort with the sales tax.""

The sales tax, if approved, would generate an anticipated $42 million a year to be split among cities and the county. City and county leaders have been working to convince voters that it’s the only way to fund road and water fixes, and that a half-cent sales tax would put Volusia on equal footing with its neighbors and most other counties in Florida. Some residents, though, have objected to the cost, the way the county has managed growth or how the vote has been handled.

Tipton can't think of a better retirement gift for the out-going South Daytona manager than an election win.

""I hope that for the sake of the county the voters approve it,"" Tipton said. ""He (Yarbrough) certainly stayed in there and gave it his best effort and he’s to be applauded for that.”

'He was there'

After four decades in the public sector, Yarbrough understands that every action comes with critics — and the sales tax vote is no exception. But he acknowledges how fortunate he's been that controversy never put him at odds with the council. He felt especially lucky to work alongside the same mayor for 20 years, the late Joe Piggotte.

The city's new mayor, Bill Hall, a former police chief, doesn't view Yarbrough as favorably.

""I think it was time for him to go,"" he said. ""I think it was time for the city to have a breath of fresh air. I don’t throw rocks at people, but it was time. I think any time you have a person who stays for three decades you look for new ideas. He’s a very intelligent man and he’s done very well and I wish him all the best.""

In a city the size of South Daytona, which has a population of more than 12,000, the city manager is often the first person that residents call for animal issues, billing questions or police matters. Yarbrough took some heat for that in 2003 when the union accused him of meddling into official police business.

The police chief at the time, Gary White, defended Yarbrough, chalking it up to ""small town politics.""

Yabrough was always just a phone call away for Andy Lyons, who met Yarbrough as a former News-Journal reporter but came to know him well as a South Daytona resident. He's still grateful for the time in 2004 when the city manager came to his house with paramedics after his son, a toddler at the time, dropped a jar of jelly on the floor and put broken glass into his mouth.

Lyons' wife was alone with the boy at the time and neither she nor the paramedics could get the frightened boy to open his mouth through the pain and blood.

Yarbrough, with a commanding voice, piped up: ""Open your mouth, Noah.""

The child obeyed.

""That’s the kind of city manager and friend Joe Yarbrough was,"" recalled Lyons, now the communications director for a hospital in Charleston, South Carolina. ""For the Lyons family what’s so significant about that moment, it’s not just that he had the commanding voice, it’s the fact that Joe Yarbrough was there. He was there for you.""

And he's been there for three decades, even as other cities tried to snatch him away with offers for more money. What has kept him here so long?

It's an easy answer.

""The city has been very good to me,"" he said. ""Rarely do you get to have a child and raise it and stay in the same school system. I have a youngin' that was born right here in the hospital and grew up here. Having that family here helps.

""Yes, I could have left and made more money, but why?"" Yarbrough said. ""I had a home here. I've spent longer here than I have any one place in my life. It's my home.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190425/after-nearly-32-years-at-south-daytona-joe-yarbrough-to-see-out-sales-tax-vote?rssfeed=true,2019-04-25T13:07:51Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
904,"After 32 years at South Daytona, Joe Yarbrough to see out sales tax vote","Come May 22, Joe Yarbrough will have more free time to go out on a fishing boat with a couple of beers and drift as far away from government offices as he likes.

No worries. No phone calls to answer. No more complaints from residents or elected officials.

Until then, though, the former city manager of South Daytona, who actually retired more than a month ago after three decades on the job, has to see something through that he started nearly five years ago.

When the ballots are mailed out next week for a special election on a half-cent sales tax that would raise money for road and water infrastructure projects throughout Volusia County, the final countdown on Yarbrough's government service will begin — and the results of the May 21 tally will determine if his final send-off includes a victory lap.

Yarbrough, 67, is already viewed as a role model to other city managers who came on after he arrived. And he's beloved by the residents who appreciate his folksy charm and attention to public service, including one who tells of the time the manager rushed to his house to look after a child who had accidentally eaten glass.

After a more than 40-year career in the public sector, Yarbrough's profile has never been higher. It was he who over the past five years relentlessly lobbied and cajoled leaders at Volusia's 16 cities to unite behind the sales tax push, which he has joked more than once may be the first time they've agreed on anything.

But no matter the outcome of the tax, Yarbrough has no intention of leaving his home in South Daytona, where he lives with his wife, Bobbie, and where he raised two sons. Gabriel, 37, works as a chemist with the city of Daytona Beach, while Joey is currently a doctor working a residency in Shreveport, Louisiana. At 27, he's about the age his father was when he took his first city manager gig.

The caller told deputies that the pickup driver followed him down Royal Palms Parkway, passed him and slammed on his brakes, causing both vehicles to stop in the middle of the street. While the pickup was in front of the first driver's car, he was able to copy down the pickup's license number.

The first driver passed the pickup, whose driver was screaming at him, and drove to his house. The pickup followed him into his driveway and the driver cursed and threatened him.

Deputies used the tag number to determine the pickup driver's address, and he told them a vehicle had cut him off on Interstate 95 and again on State Road 100. He was angry and followed the driver to his house ""to teach him a lesson.""

When deputies asked the pickup driver about the car on I-95, he told them it was a white car but the man he harassed was driving a black Nissan. Deputies also reported that the pickup driver smelled of alcohol and appeared to be intoxicated. Assault charges were referred to the State Attorney's Office.

910,Regional tennis: Fort Myers boys avenge regional loss to Naples; Bishop Verot sweeps,"Tennis (Photo: iStock)

Class 3A boys

Fort Myers 4, Naples 1

Fort Myers avenged last year’s regional semifinal loss by beating Naples.

The Green Wave swept the No. 2 through No. 5 singles matches, with Chris Zuk, Nathan Smiley, Christian Spencer and Samuel Smiley all notching victories.

Naples’ Michael Moll won the No. 1 singles match by beating Tyler Carlin, 6-3, 6-0.

Coming into the season, the Golden Eagles knew they’d have a tall order in defending their regional title. Naples lost its No. 2 and No. 3 singles players from last year, with Justin Braverman transferring to Community School and Mason Anderson graduating. That moved players like Garnel-Marc Guerrier and Alex Richey-Klein up two spots, where they played well throughout the year. They ran into a deep Fort Myers team Tuesday, however.

“We did well defending our district title and making it this far,” Naples coach Tony Kamen said. “I’ve been at this 20 years and I always say the same thing. You get a team where you want it to be experience-wise, and then kids graduate. We knew from seeing Fort Myers in the regular season that this was going to be a tough match. They just had too much depth.”

It’s not all bad news for the Golden Eagles, though. Moll, who is having a dominant senior year, moves on to the individual singles bracket at the state tournament, while Moll and Guerrier qualified for doubles by virtue of Naples’ district championship victory.

Venice 4, Barron Collier 0

The Cougars's season end with a loss to Venice.

Barron Collier’s Kai Kemp fell to Venice’s Ryan Rajakar at No. 1 singles, 6-1, 6-0. Joe Compitello lost to Alex Dina at No. 2 singles, 6-0, 6-0. Rajakar teamed with Ben Zipay to defeat Kemp and Frank LaPorta at No. 1 doubles, while Jaden Wiesinger and Ryan Sherwood topped the team of Christian Franke and Alex Foster at No. 2 doubles.

Venice hosts Fort Myers for the regional title on Thursday.

Class 3A girls

Gulf Coast 4, Venice 2

The Sharks received a test from the visiting Indians, but still advanced to the regional final.

Emma Heiderscheit (No. 1), Emma Schilling (No. 3) and Nikki Okenka (No. 5) all won singles matches in straight sets. Heiderscheit and Zoe Rosu combined for a straight-set victory at No. 1 doubles to clinch the match.

“Give credit to Venice,” Sharks coach Mark Voorhees said. “They fought hard on all courts. We just made a couple more shots than they did.”

The Sharks host rival Barron Collier in the regional championship Thursday at 3 p.m. The winner moves on to the state tournament. These two teams have dominated the region in recent years, with the Sharks winning the last three regional titles and Barron Collier taking six in a row before that. Gulf Coast won the state championship in 2017, while the Cougars won it all in 2005, 2012 and 2013. The Cougars have also finished as the state runner-up four times (2003, 2004, 2006, 2010).

Barron Collier 4, Fort Myers 1

The Cougars earned a date with rival Gulf Coast by beating the Green Wave in a hard-fought regional semifinal match.

Barron Collier’s Lauren Schave lost to Fort Myers’ Shani Idlette, 6-2, 6-3, at No. 1 singles. The Cougars won the four other singles matches, including a come-from-behind win by Solana Gonzales over Alexandra Dorofeev in the No. 3 match. Also earning victories for the Cougars were Jaeda Cooper (No. 2), Lohren Waylonis (No. 4) and Isabella Sorhegui (No. 5).

“I keep reinforcing that this is a team sport and the 4 and 5 singles courts are critical,” Cougars coach Nancy Geiman said. “So proud of everyone, but especially Lohren and Isabella for defeating their opponents (Paris Thompson and Valeria Meruvia) after losing to them in the regular season. We had a game plan and they played super-brave. We’re happy to keep this ride going and see what Thursday holds in store.”

Barron Collier lost all but the No. 2 doubles match in the district championship against Gulf Coast, but the Cougars were competitive in several matches.

They just had too much depth.”

It’s not all bad news for the Golden Eagles, though. Moll, who is having a dominant senior year, moves on to the individual singles bracket at the state tournament, while Moll and Guerrier qualified for doubles by virtue of Naples’ district championship victory.

Venice 4, Barron Collier 0

The Cougars's season end with a loss to Venice.

Barron Collier’s Kai Kemp fell to Venice’s Ryan Rajakar at No. 1 singles, 6-1, 6-0. Joe Compitello lost to Alex Dina at No. 2 singles, 6-0, 6-0. Rajakar teamed with Ben Zipay to defeat Kemp and Frank LaPorta at No. 1 doubles, while Jaden Wiesinger and Ryan Sherwood topped the team of Christian Franke and Alex Foster at No. 2 doubles.

Venice hosts Fort Myers for the regional title on Thursday.

Class 3A girls

Gulf Coast 4, Venice 2

The Sharks received a test from the visiting Indians, but still advanced to the regional final.

Emma Heiderscheit (No. 1), Emma Schilling (No. 3) and Nikki Okenka (No. 5) all won singles matches in straight sets. Heiderscheit and Zoe Rosu combined for a straight-set victory at No. 1 doubles to clinch the match.

“Give credit to Venice,” Sharks coach Mark Voorhees said. “They fought hard on all courts. We just made a couple more shots than they did.”

The Sharks host rival Barron Collier in the regional championship Thursday at 3 p.m. The winner moves on to the state tournament. These two teams have dominated the region in recent years, with the Sharks winning the last three regional titles and Barron Collier taking six in a row before that. Gulf Coast won the state championship in 2017, while the Cougars won it all in 2005, 2012 and 2013. The Cougars have also finished as the state runner-up four times (2003, 2004, 2006, 2010).

Barron Collier 4, Fort Myers 1

The Cougars earned a date with rival Gulf Coast by beating the Green Wave in a hard-fought regional semifinal match.

Barron Collier’s Lauren Schave lost to Fort Myers’ Shani Idlette, 6-2, 6-3, at No. 1 singles. The Cougars won the four other singles matches, including a come-from-behind win by Solana Gonzales over Alexandra Dorofeev in the No. 3 match. Also earning victories for the Cougars were Jaeda Cooper (No. 2), Lohren Waylonis (No. 4) and Isabella Sorhegui (No. 5).

“I keep reinforcing that this is a team sport and the 4 and 5 singles courts are critical,” Cougars coach Nancy Geiman said. “So proud of everyone, but especially Lohren and Isabella for defeating their opponents (Paris Thompson and Valeria Meruvia) after losing to them in the regular season. We had a game plan and they played super-brave. We’re happy to keep this ride going and see what Thursday holds in store.”

Barron Collier lost all but the No. 2 doubles match in the district championship against Gulf Coast, but the Cougars were competitive in several matches.

912,Food Network's 'The Great Food Truck Race' is in Fort Myers (we think),"CLOSE Five food trucks that appear to be competing in the Food Network show ""The Great Food Truck Race"" fed hungry fans during a May 21-22 visit to Oxnard. Here's a look at their menus, at which ""Jersey Shore"" star is competing with his Mom's recipes -- and at where they're headed next.

Is Food Network's 'The Great Food Truck Race' shooting in Fort Myers this week? Few can say for sure, but signs point to yes.

All signs point to ""The Great Food Truck Race"" rolling through the Fort Myers area this week.

Even if nobody can technically confirm it.

Sign 1: Tyler Florence, the celebrity chef who hosts the Food Network reality competition, popped into Bennett's Fresh Roast in downtown Fort Myers late this morning for a couple dozen doughnuts and a quadruple shot of espresso (clearly he had a LOT of work ahead of him).

Sign 2: A handful of national food trucks have been calling local breweries trying to secure last-minute spots at their venues.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

According to posts on Facebook, Fort Myers Brewing Co. in Gateway is hosting a ""National Food Truck Competition"" from 2-7 p.m. Wednesday and 10:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Thursday. Millennial Brewing Co. in downtown Fort Myers also has an event from 10:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Thursday featuring the Rolling Indulgence food truck, a ""National Food Truck Competition Contestant"" from Dayton, Ohio.

""I can't say much,"" Fort Myers Brewing's owner Jen Gratz-Whyte said. ""It's all still coming together. What we put on Facebook is pretty much the extent of what we're allowed to say.""

Kyle Cebull, owner of Millennial, was equally evasive. After a bit of prodding, he offered this:

""I mean, I can say that, you know, we’re very excited that we’re going to get to be a part of this traveling event. We host food trucks all the time, but this is definitely going to be a unique experience with a truck from out of the area.""

If blog posts and recent media coverage are any indication, then the Food Network reality show seems to have made its way down the East Coast of the U.S. in recent weeks.

A February article from seacoastonline.com put Florence and ""The Great Food Truck Race"" in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In March, providencejournal.com had the show in Middletown, Rhode Island. Earlier this month, wmbfnews.com said the series was taping in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

The show's ninth season aired in August and was shot out west, where Florence welcomed ""seven teams of brand new food truck operators as they embark(ed) on the adventure of a lifetime,"" a Food Network page noted.

The trucks compete for sales in various towns, with the worst-performing truck booted from the competition at the end of each show. The final two trucks then compete head to head in the finale for $50,000 in prize money.

So, is the show really here?

Sign 3 is a doozy: Bob Grissinger, owner of Bennett's (possibly Florence's new favorite doughnut and espresso spot), says yes. The doughnut maker seems not to be under the same gag orders imposed on the breweries. In a post to Bennett's Facebook page, Grissinger said Florence was in town this morning, ""shooting (an) episode of his series The Great Food Truck Race,"" adding, ""Happy shooting guys. Enjoy our wonderful town!""

Although Food Network officials haven't responded to a request for comment, the signs are all here.

914,Grogan Strong Gala will benefit Pensacola police officer fighting brain cancer,"CLOSE Fundraisers all over the city of Pensacola have taken place or will take place in the coming weeks and months to benefit Stephen Grogan and his family as the police officer battles terminal brain cancer. Wochit, Wochit

The highly anticipated Grogan Strong Gala is finally around the corner, and organizers hope the black-tie affair in Pensacola will raise ample funds for the family of a Pensacola police officer grappling with terminal brain cancer.

Hannah Fortune with the Ladies of Law Enforcement, the Crestview-based church ministry group that's hosting the gala, said about 120 tickets have been sold for the fundraiser. It will take place from 5 to 9:30 p.m. Saturday at the Studer Community Institute on 220 W. Garden St., Suite 100.

Half of the proceeds from ticket sales will go directly to Officer Stephen Grogan and his family, as will all of the money raised during the silent auction. Tickets cost $30 per person and $55 per couple.

Fortune and event coordinators would like to push for 200 tickets sold by the time the doors open Saturday night. Fortune's group, the Ladies of Law Enforcement, provides networking and support for female officers in and behind the blue lines.

Fortune said she recently learned Grogan and his wife, Christina, will attend Saturday's event.

""I've limited the amount of times I've reached out to them 'cause I know they have a lot going on, but I spoke with Christina Saturday and she said she had gotten her dress and her shoes and she was really excited for next Saturday to get here,"" Fortune said. ""We are hoping to organize a limo service to give them a ride. As of right now, we haven't found one who could provide that service but I'm really hoping we can. They deserve it.""

Fortune said she learned Grogan will have a break in the treatment of his glioblastoma this weekend. She expects the Pensacola community will treat him and his wife to a memorable evening.

""I'm excited to see that the community's coming together,"" Fortune said. ""I can't wait to see Grogan and his wife ... see the community coming together again to support him.""

Grogan Strong Gala details

Hors d'oeuvre served: There won't be a formal dinner served at any time. Instead, guests are welcome to roam to various food vendors. Eggfest will serve street food like fish tacos and barbecue sliders, Florida Coconuts will offer coconut milk and Bread of Life Bake Shop will serve dessert. Fortune said it will be a dry event, so alcohol will not be served.

How the auction works: Items available for bidding include Waterboyz Surf & Skate Shop surf class and skateboard certificates, donated pieces by local artists and an assortment of restaurant certificates. Bidders must be present at the time of the auction to claim their item.

Also, Dolce & Gelato will give away personalized quarts of their gelato.

""Out of the flavors that they have available, you can choose which kinds go into your gelato,"" Fortune said.

Other donation avenues for the Grogan family: Salz Studio will operate a photo booth during the gala. Guests can have photos taken of themselves for a donation of any amount, and Salz will donate 100% of the proceeds to the Grogans, Fortune said.

Carter J. Studio will also be at the event to illustrate hand-drawn caricature portraits, either true to life or exaggerations, also for donations of any amount. Carter J. Studio's will keep 50% of what they make and donate the other half to the Grogan family.

Music for the night: The 14-piece big band Hashtag Swing will provide background tunes for the night, but the previously advertised band Redstone will not be present.

Fortune said the organizers are looking for a band to take Redstone's place in the coming days.

""Our only requirement is that I want it to be appropriate for this kind of an event so in other words, it's not a rock concert,"" Fortune said. ""We don't want anyone who just plays rock and we're not interested in (anyone performing with lyrics), we just want background music.""

Dress code: Men are not required to wear a tuxedo, but should come in a nice suit and tie. For women, Fortune said tea or cocktail length is perfectly fine for their dresses .

Where to get tickets: You can buy tickets on the Ladies of Law Enforcement's website, ladiesoflawenforcement.org. Fortune added that tentatively, the plan is to sell tickets at the door of the event. But those thinking of waiting until the last minute should call Fortune at 850-758-0152 or event planner and coordinator Felicia Rabb at 850-324-4113.

Other info to know:

Children under the age of 12 are not permitted to attend.

Organizers are looking for volunteers to help set up the event and stock beverages, food, etc., during the event. Those interested can call Rabb at the above phone number.

There is a reduced group rate of $20 per ticket for anyone buying five tickets or more.

915,Oakridge Middle School student prepares for second Scripps National Spelling Bee,"CLOSE The Scripps National Spelling Bee is in its 90th year! Many things have changed, but the reactions? They've stayed the same. USA TODAY

Oakridge Middle School student Bharath Ram gets nervous before he starts to spell a word. If he knows it, he gets calmer, but he can't keep his nerves at bay. If he doesn't know it, he's done.

At the microphone, he receives his word. He asks some questions then confidently begins to spell. Like a metronome, he takes his time spelling — letter by letter — with a measured beat.

His love of words got him to this point. For the second time, Ram, 14, will compete at the 92nd Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C. It kicks off May 26.

He fell short last year by finishing near the 40th mark in Round 3, just missing the semifinals.

Ram describes the Scripps bee as highly competitive yet encouraging to connect with other students who share his love of words.

""It's not just spelling,"" he said. ""It (spelling), itself, is a limited discipline. It's more spelling lumped in with vocabulary, lumped in with knowing words. It's more about language.""

In March, he won Collier County's Spelling Bee after spelling ""saboteur."" The Optimist Club of Naples sponsored the bee.

At Oakridge Middle, Ram reached celebrity status when his teachers asked him to autograph the school district's calendar when he became the cover star for March.

""My school has been really supportive,"" Ram said. ""I always get, 'Good Luck!' or, 'Congratulations!' if I'm about to do something.""

He's ready for Scripps, he said. He feels more prepared than ever.

""I'll know what more to expect,"" Ram said. ""I'll know the general format. I'll be a little less nervous.""

Last year, some Scripps spellers put together a group chat to support each other. Ram said he has received text messages a couple of times this competition season. The spellers cheered each other on as their school spelling bees popped up.

Ram is starting to get back into studying for the national bee after taking some time off. He uses several online tools and a traditional dictionary to run words through his memory.

He balances studying with his other school work. In his spare time, he plays piano and cello.

""The same way I would normally balance school, just add more to the list and see how you work it out,"" Ram said.

Ram started studying more on his own this year. His dad, Ram Kumar, and mom, Rekha, and little brother, Naresh, are still a support system, he said.

Kumar said his son is gaining crucial know-how through meeting like-minded kids and competing on stage.

""It is a lot about spelling, but it's also a lot about the experience itself,"" Kumar said.

Next fall, Ram will start at Gulf Coast High School. He said he can't wait to join academic clubs and compete in even more competitions at a higher level.

Kumar said Ram competes in several academic competitions throughout the year, all of which have value, but spelling competitions seem to garner the most attention.

There are common misconceptions about the craft of spelling words, Ram said. Long words are easier to remember through smaller root words.

""Some words just make sense,"" Ram said. ""There are some words that are also just like really funny.""

His strategy is to give it everything he's got. He never doubted himself during Collier County's bee and he won't doubt himself in Washington, he said.

""You just have to say all of the letters right and then at the last letter you feel pretty relieved,"" Ram said.

917,Crestview residents given no notice of waste change,"CRESTVIEW — Residents on Cassady Lane recently saw an unexpected change to their trash service.

Resident Caroline Miller said her waste was being collected by Okaloosa County’s waste company, Waste Management, until April 6 when the bins were picked up without notice.

“I called the number on my bill and spoke with a county representative with Waste Management and said ‘Hey our bins were picked up. What’s going on?’” said Miller. “He said the county and city got together. A couple weeks ago was the time frame he gave, and they decided that services for garbage were going to be through the city, not the county.”

Jason Autrey, director of Okaloosa County Public Works, said a mistake was made regarding provider services.

“There was an error on who was providing the service and it wasn’t discovered until recently,” Autrey said. “It was brought to the city of Crestview’s attention and there was a coordinated effort between our staff, their staff and our vendors to make the change.

“At the end of the day, there wasn’t good communication to the residents,” Autrey added.

The neighborhood will now be serviced by the city’s waste company, Waste Pro.

“It was my understanding when we moved into this house that we lived just outside of the city limits, hence why we were paying the county for services,” Miller said.

Miller called the city to find out why the decision was made and no warning was given. She said she spoke with someone in the billing department.

“She said that as it turns out, we are in the city limits and the county was outside of their rights servicing us for garbage and that they were in the wrong,” Miller said. “I told her I really don’t care; I really don’t. What bothers me is we weren’t given any heads up by anybody.”

Miller said new bins arrived about a week and a half later, and the cost of waste service went from $10 to $26 per month, along with a $60 deposit for the new service.

“It’s one of those things where we just don’t have a choice and that to me is just so wrong,” Miller said.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190421/crestview-residents-given-no-notice-of-waste-change?rssfeed=true,2019-04-21T11:29:50Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
918,Let Bio-One Pensacola do the dirty work for you this spring | New Business,"Spring is in full force, and it always offers the perfect opportunity to throw out the old to bring in the new. But what if you have a particularly daunting cleanup ahead of you? Or a job that involves disposing of bio-hazardous waste?

That’s where Bio-One Pensacola comes in.

Bio-One Pensacola at 707 E. Cervantes St. in Pensacola offers a wide variety of cleaning services that include restoring distressed properties due to hoarding.

Rebecca Montenegro and her husband Gabriel opened this franchise when they decided to move back to the Pensacola area.

“We wanted to do something that helps others,” Rebecca Montenegro said. “That’s when we noticed that there was not a lot of people specializing in this type of cleanup.”

But hoarding isn’t Bio-One Pensacola’s only focus. Bio-One Pensacola also specializes in crime scene cleanup, suicide cleanup, MRSA and C-Diff disinfection, feces removal and cat urine remediation.

""When a cleanup involves a crime scene or bio-hazardous waste, nobody really knows what to do,” Rebecca Montenegro said. “We assist law enforcement and public service agencies to restore property that has been contaminated as a result of crime, disaster or misuse.”

For Bio-One Pensacola, there’s no job that’s too big or small. Open 24/7, you can call at any time and schedule your free estimate.

“With us, it’s help first, business second,” Rebecca Montenegro said. “We understand each situation is sensitive, so we’re very compassionate and make sure every client feels as comfortable as possible.”

And keeping a low profile is equally important.

“We don’t show up in a vehicle with big words that say ‘biohazard’ on it,” Rebecca Montenegro said. “Our vehicles are unmarked and we’re very discreet when we do each job.”

No matter the task, at the end of the day, the couple feel a sense of satisfaction in a job well done.

“It’s very rewarding for us,” Rebecca Montenegro said. “We look forward to giving back to the community and serving Pensacola.”

Bio-One Pensacola is a veteran-owned business that’s open 24/7. For more information, visit bioonepensacolafl.com, PensacolaHoarding.com or call 850-855-6349.

A man was charged Thursday with killing his wife nearly 40 years ago and plotting to murder a suburban Philadelphia police sergeant who investigated the case in the 1980s.William W. Korzon, of East Prospect, Pennsylvania, was charged with criminal homicide in the death of Gloria Korzon, who has not been seen or heard from since 1981.William Korzon, 76, who is known as Bill, was jailed after being arraigned at district court in Jamison, and court workers said no attorney appeared for him at the hearing. He was also charged with solicitation to commit criminal homicide, forgery and perjury.He denied killing Gloria Korzon after the arraignment.As he was led from the courthouse Thursday, he told reporters “she went to Florida” and that he has no idea where her body is.Gloria Korzon, who would be 75 years old, was declared dead in 1997.Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub said at a news conference that a grand jury investigation “added to the body of knowledge that we already had that circumstantially proved Gloria Korzon’s murder.”“This is obviously going to be a circumstantial case, because we don’t have the proverbial smoking gun,” Weintraub said.Gloria Korzon’s brother, Ralph Kidder, of Springfield, Massachusetts, said the arrest gave him hope.“It’s been a long time waiting to have justice,” Kidder said Thursday. “Until we find out what happened and where she is, it’s still not going to be put to rest. This is a step in the right direction, but until we absolutely know, it’s still not over.”A police affidavit said Korzon repeatedly abused his wife over many years. Kidder said the couple met while working at an electronics plant in Chicopee, Massachusetts.About a year after their 1967 marriage in Massachusetts, he was committed to a psychiatric facility following an arrest on charges he threatened to kill her.The abuse continued after the couple moved to Pennsylvania in 1968, police said in the affidavit. The couple had no children.“During these incidents of domestic violence, Gloria suffered multiple injuries, including a broken arm, a broken collarbone, damage to her nasal bone and a black eye. Many of these injuries required hospitalizations,” police said. Gloria Korzon documented the abuse in letters to her attorney.Gloria Korzon was last seen working at an electronics plant in the Philadelphia suburb of Horsham on March 6, 1981.“She did go to work that day, that we have proof of,” Weintraub said. “And afterward, there is absolutely no evidence of her continued existence.”A few days later, police said, Bill Korzon told her employer to terminate her because of mental and physical health problems, retrieved her belongings and directed that her last paycheck be mailed to their home.“In the months and years following Gloria’s disappearance, Bill Korzon engaged in a series of actions to lie, conceal and profit from it,” police said.He allegedly forged her signatures on two checks in 1981 and filed a joint tax return months after she disappeared, police said.A tenant who lived in the Korzon home in 1981 told police five years later that Korzon had asked him to help ambush and kill a Warrington Township Police sergeant who was investigating Gloria Korzon’s disappearance, the charging documents allege.The Bucks County Courier Times said police dug up the Korzon home’s yard in 1986, but found only the remains of a dog.Police decided to take a fresh look at the case in 2016, and it was another two years before they had sufficient reason to bring to county prosecutors, Warrington Township Chief Daniel J. Friel said.Police said Korzon told them earlier this year he had battered his wife for years, including breaking her collarbone.“Korzon further admitted that following the date that Gloria was last seen alive, he forged Gloria’s final paycheck, credit union check and tax return so that he could illegally access Gloria’s money,” the affidavit said. “He further admitted to having perjured himself during a 1988 Orphan’s Court hearing that he initiated, in order to determine what percentage of property he was entitled to from Gloria’s estate.”During the police interview this year, investigators say, Korzon admitting signing a 1981 Mother’s Day card in Gloria Korzon’s name and sending it to her mother to make her think her daughter was still alive.He’s also alleged to have asked investigators this year: “Did you find the body?”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/did-you-find-the-body-man-charged-with-killing-wife-who-was-last-seen-40-years-ago/27213358,2019-04-20T11:06:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

""I had tears in my eyes because it's my home, and I live in it. Now I can't stay here anymore,"" resident Darla Klutman said.

""I laughed and I cried, and now we're crying again,"" Klutman's husband Nick Cabrera said.

The two were out shopping when the storm rolled through.

When the first neighbor told them what happened, they did not believe it.

When a second neighbor called, they knew it was serious.

""Now we're cutting our trip to Walmart short, and we're coming home,"" Cabrera said.

They can now see what a close call they had.

Part of the tree hit the living room, another part hit the bathroom and a large branch fell on the bed.

""At least it happened during the daytime, not when we were sleeping,"" Klutman said.

""Oh, if we were sleeping, it would have (fallen) right on my wife, the tree would have hit right on her,"" Cabrera said.

Another tree fell on the neighbor's trailer, but he said he's not upset.

""My neighbor came over and was going to fix my house before he fixed his. That's the kind of neighbor he is. That's my best friend,"" neighbor Michael Gould said.

Cabrera and Klutman have checked into a nearby hotel for now.

David, 57, and Louise Turpin, 50, were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison after they pleaded guilty to holding captive and torturing 12 of their 13 children for years in their California home.The parents each spoke before the sentencing.""I'm sorry for everything I've done to hurt my children,"" Louise Turpin said, adding she believes God has a special plan for each of them. ""I love them more than they could ever imagine.""David Turpin broke down in tears as he tried to address the court.

922,Suzy Fleming Leonard: Soup's on to raise money for chaplain services at Brevard jail,"A Soup Challenge on April 25 in Suntree will benefit chaplain ministries at the Brevard County Jail Complex. (Photo: Ozgur Coskun, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Soup can be nostalgia in a bowl. Just the aroma of flour and oil sizzling in a pot, the beginnings of a dark, mysterious roux for gumbo, can transport me to winter weekends with my mother at the stove.

It is warm and comforting, a cure for what ails you.

It also can help to heal our community, even as the weather heats up in Florida and the soup pot tends to get pushed to the back burner.

That's Nancy Diesel Oliver's assertion, anyway. From 5:30 to 8 p.m. April 25, she's hosting a Soup Challenge at Suntree United Methodist Church, 7400 N. Wickham Road in Melbourne.

The event, which includes soup tastings and a silent auction, benefits the chaplain ministry at the Brevard County Jail Complex.

Nancy and colleague Jon Nienhuis work with the county's more than 1,700 inmates, offering counseling, Bible study and other spiritual support.

Their work is good for the soul, she said, but it's also good for the community.

""Almost none of these inmates are going to be in jail or prison for life,"" she said. If she and Jon can help the change an incarcerated person’s path, it's a win for everyone.

The chaplains aren't county employees, they're missionaries, so they must raise money to cover their salaries, benefits and expenses. They hold a golf tournament each fall. The Soup Challenge is new.

The jail population comes from police jurisdictions across the county, so Nancy paired area police departments with restaurants, which will provide 5 to 6 gallons of soup for the event.

A Golden Ladle award will be given to the People's Choice soup, and critic's choice honors will be awarded, too.

Participating are:

Chef Larry's Cafe for the Titusville Police Department

La Estancia De Luisa for the Palm Bay Police Department

Sun on the Beach (in Satellite Beach) for the Indian Harbour Beach Police Department

Ashley's Restaurant for the Rockledge Police Department

Staff dining at the jail for the Brevard County Sheriff's Office

Churches that support the ministry and other organizations have purchased tables of eight for the event. Walk-in tickets will be available for $40 per person or $75 per couple. Nancy is hoping for 240 attendees.

She's excited about the event, which will be fun, but more importantly, she hopes will bring attention to what the chaplains do in the county jail.

""There's a whole lot that goes into this ministry,"" she said.

The chaplains teach classes in healing and offer tools for coping with stress and anger. They teach multiple Bible study classes each week, and counsel inmates one-on-one. They notify inmates when a family member dies. They work with people of all faiths. They give Bibles to inmates who ask for them.

They also counsel deputies who might be going through rough times.

Nancy said she's just following instructions.

She referred to the Bible, Matthew 25:36 and 40: ""I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.

... ""Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.""

By supporting the chaplain ministry, people are helping these brothers and sisters, she said.

""We want people to know we're here.""

I never realized a bowl of soup could have such an impact.

Coming next week: I'll tell you about another soup-related event that's helping the hungry. And I'll share a couple of easy soup recipes.

930,Restaurant review: Taplow Pub at PGA Golf Club offers casual but sensational food in a beautiful club atmosphere,"Two golfers walk into a pub after finishing a round at the PGA Golf Course and join some neighbors for lunch. No. It’s not a joke, this is what happens every day at the Taplow Pub.

Located within the PGA Village and inside the Golf Club, the pub is open to members and non-members alike. Taplow is laid out as precisely as the golf greens. Two high-tops down the middle encourage camaraderie and tall tales. On either side are tables and chairs upholstered in plaid. Blue leather booths line the walls. At the far end is a large bar with taupe leather stools. Overhead, and on each side of the booths, televisions are tuned to. . . golf (naturally). Round capiz shell chandeliers and palm frond-bladed fans hang from high ceilings.

The lunch and dinner menu is what you would expect – classy pub fare. Appetizers include soups, wings, nachos, and potato skins. Salads, pizza, burgers, and sandwiches, and club favorite entrees complete the choices.

The menu clearly states a 20% service charge for food and beverage services will be automatically added to your bill and that no additional gratuity is necessary. I have mixed feelings about automatic gratuities but this was not an issue for us since the service we received was excellent.

My husband and I ordered drinks and baked pretzel braids ($9) to share. Two large pretzel braids were served with a side of queso sauce and brown mustard. The hot, soft, salty pretzels were served on a wooden cutting board. Ripped into hunks appropriate for dipping, they were delicious.

Our waiter, Sean, told us the pizza and the hamburgers were amazing, but the meatloaf and salmon were definitely pub favorites. My husband chose the homestyle meatloaf ($16). He started with a cup of chili topped with cheese, sour cream and scallions. The chili was only mildly spicy but was thick, hearty and very enjoyable.

His dinner was two slices of house-made beef meatloaf full of mushrooms and onions, along with a Cabernet, caramelized onion, and mushroom demi-glace. The meatloaf was full of great flavors, but the texture was a little dry. The zesty and sweet glaze was wonderful and enhanced the meatloaf tremendously. The cole slaw was disappointing and tasteless.

I ordered the Taplow Atlantic salmon ($21). The fish was excellent – perfectly pan seared – with a light crust on the outside but moist on the inside. It was topped with a silky, lemony, buttery sauce. A scoop of creamy red-skinned mashed potatoes and a palate-pleasing medley of sautéed squash and red peppers made it a hole-in-one. The chef should have put a couple of wedges of lemon on the plate for the salmon but at my request, Sean quickly brought me some.

For dessert, we ordered a triple chocolate cake ($6) with a side of vanilla ice cream ($1). What appeared was a humongous, decadent slice of rich, triple-layered cake with equally thick chocolate icing. The dessert was nothing short of bingo, bango, bongo.

Taplow Pub at PGA Golf Club is a charming spot for golfers to relax after a game or for anyone who simply wants to dine in a beautiful club atmosphere on casual but sensational food.

931,Daytona's Museum of Arts & Sciences aiming for $10 million endowment,"After sinking nearly $9 million into improvements at the Museum of Arts & Sciences over the past seven years, the Daytona Beach museum is kicking off a one-year campaign to raise $10 million for an operations and maintenance endowment.

DAYTONA BEACH — Over the past decade, the Museum of Arts & Sciences has undergone a dizzying blast of expansion and improvement.

There's a new state-of-the-art planetarium with a 40-foot-diameter dome and digital projector. An overhaul was completed on the building that houses a mock train station with two historic railroad cars and a large collection of yesteryear railroad memorabilia. There have also been improvements to the Root Family Museum that houses antique automobiles and the largest collection of Coca-Cola memorabilia in Florida.

The flood-damaged west wing was rebuilt into a sleek modernized replacement. The museum's front entrance lobby was expanded and remodeled. And most recently the hurricane-damaged boardwalk trail that winds through an outdoor natural preserve was repaired.

With all the rebuilding complete and bills paid, the museum's 19 trustees realized they had one more project to tackle: Raising enough money to operate and maintain everything well into the future.

""I think they get there is a continuity of a project they started a long time ago,"" said museum Executive Director Andrew Sandall. ""Rebuilding to be a 21st century museum also includes our financial system.""

Sandall and the museum's Board of Trustees agreed creating an endowment was going to be the best way to preserve the remodeled 100,000-square-foot facility and do justice to the nearly $9 million poured into reconstruction and updates since 2012.

Their goal for the endowment is a big one: raise $10 million over the next 12 months. But they're getting a huge boost from two of the museum's strongest supporters, Cici and Hyatt Brown.

The Browns have agreed to match donations two for one, so if $3.33 million can be raised the Browns will throw in the remaining $6.66 million.

""Your endowment should be the size of your capital investment in the buildings you construct,"" said Cici Brown, a museum board member and longtime supporter.

""We're very enthusiastic about it,"" said Hyatt Brown, chairman of the board for insurance firm Brown & Brown, Inc. ""Two for one is hard to turn down.""

It's just the Browns' latest act of major generosity. In the last few years, the philanthropic couple's donations to the museum, Stetson University and Daytona Beach's Riverfront Park have tallied $60 million. That total will grow to $66.6 million if the $3.33 million is raised for the museum and the Browns give $6.66 million to bridge the gap to $10 million.

Museum leaders decided to secure their future with their operating costs at a new high and state funding plummeting. State money for cultural programs has plunged from $43 million in the 2014-15 fiscal year to $2.65 million in the current budget year, a 90 percent drop.

""Any museum not properly endowed will probably go under,"" Hyatt Brown said. ""Government will not have the money to give. Some will sell art, which donors don't like. A lot of museums will wither and die.""

Trustees have personally contributed $250,000 to the new endowment so far, and a local philanthropist has given $150,000. Sandall said fundraising is beginning with targeted individual giving from long-term donors, and will later branch out.

""We do not have any fundraising events planned yet, although that will develop as we move through the campaign,"" he said. ""We are definitely looking at some naming opportunities and there will absolutely be recognition of the endowment donors in the lobby of the museum.""

He said small contributions are also welcome, and large donations can be paid out over the next three years. Contributors can also make their payments monthly, or every six months, he said.

""The board is very committed to this,"" said Sandall, who noted trustees brought in a fundraising consultant. ""This is their priority for the next two years.""

He said the money will be invested with a goal of earning 5 percent annually. A museum investment committee will work to get the best returns possible. Sandall said the money will earn interest in banks and go into moderate risk stocks and bonds.

The museum might only need part of what's earned on the principle for operations and maintenance, and any extra earnings can be invested, he said.

[ALSO READ: Cici and Hyatt Brown announce $10 million pledge for Daytona art museum]

Creating an endowment with a two-for-one match was a formula that worked for the Browns and the museum just a few years ago. In 2015, the Browns pledged to give $10 million for another museum endowment if other donors would chip in $5 million.

The other endowment was set up for the Cici and Hyatt Brown Museum of Art, which opened four years ago. The 26,000-square-foot art museum was named for the Browns after they donated $14 million to build the facility and filled it with 2,600 of their Florida-themed paintings dating back to the early 1800s that are worth tens of millions of dollars.

The art museum is located on the same heavily wooded 90-acre property that's home to the Museum of Arts & Sciences, and it's owned and operated by the Museum of Arts & Sciences.

Sandall, who has been the museum's executive director since 2012, said he's had a few years to watch the art museum endowment work as hoped. Since the $15 million was raised for that endowment, there has been enough money to cover the art museum's operating costs and build a separate fund for future major repairs and improvements to the site, he said.

""The Brown museum endowment has grown substantially from its original $15 million target thanks to prudent investing,"" Sandall said. ""This success was one of the major factors in driving the desire to build a similar endowment for (the main museum).""

Sandall stressed that the Brown art museum endowment funds are used only for the art museum, which has about $800,000 in annual operating and maintenance expenses. The endowment covers about 60 percent of that and the remainder is paid for with art museum ticket sales, events and loaning out some of the 2,600 paintings.

The Museum of Arts & Sciences has an annual operating budget of about $2 million.

Sandall said the main museum isn't struggling to pay its bills, there's no debt to clear off, and no new projects are on the horizon. The facility raises money with admissions, memberships, social programming, annual fundraising and county government contributions of about $60,000-$70,000 per year.

There are also 10 existing endowments that have a combined worth of $10 million and cover about 20 percent of annual costs. The museum is just reacting to the reality of increased operating costs and decreased state government contributions, Sandall said. [ALSO READ: State funding for Volusia, Flagler cultural programs plummets]

""We've seen it drop so much in the past 10 years, there's no point in relying on it anymore,"" said Sandall, who's a trustee of the Florida Association of Museums. ""I think the political winds have changed.""

Some years, the Museum of Arts & Sciences received millions of dollars from the state. Just 15 years ago, about $300,000 was flowing from Tallahassee every year.

In the 2014-2015 fiscal year, the Museum of Arts & Sciences received $390,000 from the state. State funding started dropping in the three years after that to $72,679, $91,420 and $48,177. In the current fiscal year, the museum is receiving $10,000 in state funds.

""We recognize that state funding will never go back to the levels the museum enjoyed just 10 years ago,"" said Jenelle Codianne, the museum's director of marketing and public relations.

Sandall said he's been able to work around the loss of state dollars, and any money that does come from the capital will be a bonus to help with more programming.

""We want to be masters of our own funding,"" he said.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190423/daytonas-museum-of-arts-amp-sciences-aiming-for-10-million-endowment?rssfeed=true,2019-04-23T14:11:00Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

STUART — A Stuart developer seeking to purchase the city-owned Northpoint property for $950,000 is on his way toward closing on the vacant waterfront site near the Roosevelt Bridge.

City commissioners Monday voted unanimously to allow Richard Geisinger to buy the Northpoint property.

Closing on the sales contract is scheduled to happen by June 10.

The project was slated for a February vote but a delay was granted to give city staff time to negotiate specific points with the Geisinger.

The purchasing contract was changed to include holding Geisinger to a timetable for development that would ensure the project would be finished by December 2023.

He has until December 2022 to pull all required permits, city records said.

Since 2017, Geisinger has been granted two extensions to close on the property.

When completed, the 2.7-acre Northpoint site north of the Roosevelt Bridge will include a 27,300 square foot office building, 1,338 square feet of retail space, a 200-seat restaurant, an 18-space parking garage and a dock with up to 12 boat slips.

Geisinger on Tuesday said watching city commissioners vote 5-0 in support of the sale “felt great.”

“This is a huge project that has a lot of challenges and it was .. a good feeling seeing all of them vote for it,” he said.

“We spent a lot of time with staff in between the last meeting and this meeting trying to make sure we accomplished the things they wanted us to do.""

That included widening a sidewalk slated for a portion of Old Dixie Highway.

""What that did was influence the office building,"" he said, ""and I lost parking under the office building and that caused us to redesign the office building.”

The new design, though, was even better and “that’s a good thing,” he said.

The next step is getting all the required permits to begin infrastructure work, then move to constructing the restaurant. The office building will go up last.

“Every agency in the world is involved in this project because it’s on the water,” Geisinger said.

While preliminary site work is ongoing, he said the architecture plans for the restaurant and office building will be completed.

At Monday's city commission meeting, Mayor Becky Bruner told Geisinger she hoped the project was ""very successful.""

""I've been a little, just nervous but I think maybe we all are,"" Bruner said. ""But I wish you great success and I guess my main thing is that we want to get paid, we don't want it to go on any longer.""

It's taken a couple of years for Geisinger to gain the city's approval, including a public referendum that passed in 2017.

“I almost forget we had to do that because it was a year and a half ago,” Geisinger said. “So coming from there to finally getting to here is a big relief.”

935,Blue Wahoos host big Easter weekend with four events,"CLOSE Blue Wahoos pitcher Dusten Knight performs a celebratory backflip after closing out game. Courtesy of the Pensacola Blue Wahoos, Pensacola News Journal

The perfect weather was only part of the Pensacola Blue Wahoos memorable Easter weekend.

In two days, the Blue Wahoos (12-5) won two games, extending the best record in the Southern League, staged their massive Egga-Wahooza Easter Egg Hunt and hosted an inclusive sunrise Easter Sunday service produced by Marcus Pointe Baptist Church.

It was a lot in a short time. But with big impact.

Essentially within 36 hours, the Blue Wahoos welcomed more than 20,000 people to their bayfront stadium and Community Maritime Park.

“I think it’s really special,” said Blue Wahoos President Jonathan Griffith. “It meets the whole mission of the Blue Wahoos to improve the quality of life, and to have 20,000 to come down and enjoy what we have to offer at the stadium is really great.”

Sunday featured back-to-back events. The stadium provided a spectacular setting for the annual Community SonRise Service, which began at 6 a.m. with a sunrise amid crystal clear sky above Pensacola Bay and lighting its way over the left field portion of the stadium.

Once the service was complete, a professional team of event installers took down the stage, cleared the field, removed all items and enabled the Blue Wahoos to play the Mobile BayBears at 5 p.m.

The Blue Wahoos then raced to an 8-0 lead, powered by a pair of home runs, before winning 8-5 before a crowd of 3,647.

Saturday night, the Blue Wahoos delighted a sellout crowd of 5,038 in a 5-0 win to extend their fast start and first place standing as the new affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. In that game, Sean Poppen, a Harvard University graduate who was making his first Blue Wahoos start, threw five scoreless innings before the bullpen took over.

“It’s been impressive to see,” said Poppen, referring to the Blue Wahoos fast start. “Coming after in after our (previous) starters and what they have done…. I am glad I was able to put up zeroes on the board and keep that going.

“They have set the standard of excellence that everyone wants to reach now.”

The game Saturday also included the team’s periodic “Homerun for Life” moment to showcase a youth or adult who has battled serious illness or hardship. In the case of Saturday’s event, John Matthew Peacock, who turns 4-years-old in May, leaped into the waiting arms of Blue Wahoos mascot Kazoo, who met the boy at home plate after he ran the bases.

Both teams came out of their dugouts to line the baselines in the fifth-inning event.

Peacock’s mother, Jessica Stevens, explained in a biography provided by the Studer Family Children’s Hospital at Sacred Heart, she was 30 weeks into pregnancy when diagnosed with a medical condition. Her son was born four weeks early and spent two weeks in intensive care.

After being born weighing only 4 pounds, he slowly got better and out of danger. At 3, he started learning Spanish. He became a Blue Wahoos fans and is now playing wee-ball.

“The thing we do there… that is great,” said Blue Wahoos manager Ramon Borrego, seeing his first Homerun for Life. “You could hear a lot of the players… it was the first time they saw it and they were talking about how great. It was an unbelievable thing to see.”

Earlier Saturday, the Blue Wahoos hosted what organizers said was the largest of the Egga-Wahooza plastic egg hunts. More than 5,000 kids were part of the scene.

An all-night effort ensued after Saturday’s baseball game to get the venue ready for church service. This was the first time since the Blue Wahoos inaugural season in 2012 they have played a home game on Easter.

“We had people had people in here all day, all night long,” Griffith said. “We were able to get everything off the field by 11 a.m (Sunday) so we know next time we can have an earlier game and keep our 2 p.m. start on early-season Sunday games.

Sunday, reliever Dusten Knight punctuated the Blue Wahoos’ victory against the BayBears with his signature backflip, after recording his fourth save in four attempts. The three-hour game featured 22 hits, including 13 for extra bases, before Knight sealed the deal.

“I love that feeling. I love the adrenaline that comes with it,” said Knight, 28, an Oklahoma native, who pitched in the San Francisco Giants organization before the Minnesota Twins acquired him in December. “I love the excitement.

“And I love being that guy out there who helps my team win. It is what every relief pitcher lives for. That is our dream job to have.”

The Blue Wahoos will continue their season against Mobile on Monday with flame-thrower Brusdar Graterol on the mound. Tuesday, Devin Smeltzer will pitch only five days after sustaining a line drive off the back of his neck in a road game against Biloxi.

The weekend became the Blue Wahoos biggest on an Easter weekend. In 2012, the egg hunt was only a couple hundred kids on the field. This year, it was a three-hour event with two separate children’s divisions of age groups scouring for the eggs.

“It is exciting,” Griffith said. “When (fans) are here they are seeing good baseball. When you lose by a lot people notice. We’ve been in every game (all five losses by one run).

The four events in 36 hours reinforce what Blue Wahoos Stadium and the team have meant. The Blue Wahoos are approaching their 500th home game in franchise history.

“With everything that is happening downtown, this is another layer of that,” Griffith said. “Making Pensacola that strong town that we want. That award we won (Strong Towns No. 1) comes from the hard work we have done in our community.”

937,One child's journey through the system is over,"FORT WALTON BEACH — After more than 60 foster homes and one failed adoption, Mark's journey through the system came to an end Wednesday.

Mark's adoption by his dads, Larry and Johnathan, was finalized at the Okaloosa County Courthouse Annex Extension in Fort Walton Beach.

""I don't even know how to describe it,"" Larry said when asked how he felt about the adoption being final. ""It's such a happy feeling.""

""I'm very excited,"" Johnathan said. ""Because with his past, being able to provide for him and give him every opportunity going forward, I'm very excited.""

Mark, 11, selected his own name. He chose to take the couple's last name and Larry's middle name on his own, Larry said.

""It makes us feel very special that he has bonded with our family that much,"" Larry added.

Larry and Johnathan, who have been married for almost two years, began their journey to parenthood when they filled out a compatibility test through Family Match that showcased what they were looking for in a child. Larry said they were a 95 percent match for Mark, who filled out a similar test that showcased what he was looking for in a family.

""It's so interesting because even though he's an adopted child, he has so many characteristics that are similar to the two of ours,"" Larry said. ""We have personality traits and habits that would make us seem biological.""

Within a week of contacting a Families First Network case worker about Mark, Larry said they were able to meet him.

The family spent Christmas break together, but Mark had to return to his foster family for a short time.

""We had to take him back, which was heartbreaking,"" Larry said. ""But at least we knew he was somewhere good.""

However, the family wasn't separated long. Mark returned to Larry and Johnathan a short three days later.

""The judge ended up granting him permanent stay,"" Larry said. ""He's been our son since then. We've been a family, and today it became official.""

They have been living together since Jan. 1. Larry said Mark has done wonderfully, but it hasn't always been easy for them.

""We've had our ups and downs and challenges, but so does any family,"" Larry said. ""We were able to make it through because all we want to do is give him a good home and the best life that he could have. That's what he deserves.""

After leaving the courtroom, Mark asked his dads if he could go spend his Target gift card given to him by Circuit Judge Mary Polson on a new Lego set.

""Legos are his thing,"" Larry said.

When asked how excited he was for the adoption being final, Mark simply replied, ""One hundred.""",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190420/one-childs-journey-through-system-is-over?rssfeed=true,2019-04-20T15:03:24Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

941,California couple who shackled children could get life in prison,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. AP photo

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The desperate cry for help came from a girl who had lived in such isolation for 17 years that she didn’t know her address, the month of the year or what the word medication meant.

But after jumping out a window from the filthy home where she lived with her parents and 12 siblings, she knew enough to punch the digits 9-1-1 into a barely workable cellphone and then began describing years of horrific abuse to a police dispatcher.

The brave girl’s call that freed her siblings — some who had been chained to their beds — led to the opposite fate for their parents, David and Louise Turpin, who face 25 years to life in prison when sentenced Friday.

Investigators found that the toddler had not been abused, but all of the children were hospitalized after they were discovered.

The seven adult children were living together and attending school in February when their parents pleaded guilty. Attorney Jack Osborn, who represents them, declined to comment on them Thursday.

It’s not clear if any children will attend the sentencing, but they will be offered a chance to speak or can offer written statements to be read in court.

Defense attorneys would not say if their clients will address the court.

The couple pleaded guilty to 14 criminal charges. Prosecutors said the deal would likely keep them in prison for the rest of their lives and spare the children from testifying.

“The defendants ruined lives, so I think it’s just and fair that the sentence be equivalent to first-degree murder,” District Attorney Mike Hestrin said at the time of the plea.",http://www.wfla.com/national/california-couple-who-shackled-children-could-get-life-in-prison/1938353459,2019-04-19T10:54:14Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

According to the BBC, Shantelle Johnson, her partner Colen Nulgit and their puppy, Ace, were spending time in Keep River National Park when their vehicle got stuck. The family ended up having to spend the night in their car but ""said they feared the rising tide would bring in crocodiles.""

Earlier that day, the couple reported seeing two or three crocodile tracks and since they were stuck right near saltwater, they knew they had to get out of there.

Fortunately, they had told their families where they were before they left and when the families weren't able to reach them, a search team was sent.

Fearing that no one would see them in the marshland, Johnson and Nulgit lit a fire and wrote the word 'HELP' in the mud, hoping search and rescue would spot it.

If there's one person who's been to a lot of nuptials, it's a wedding photographer. Which is why photographers are probably the best at recognizing the telltale signs of whether a wedding day is going smoothly and if the couple is going to work out. Someone asked wedding photographers to share the red flags that a couple's marriage is potentially doomed on Reddit, posting the question, ""Marriage/engagement photographers/videographers of Reddit, have you developed a sixth sense for which marriages will flourish and which will not? What are the green and red flags?""The thread has had over 6,000 replies, with photographers across the world sharing the very telling signs a couple is destined for failure, including faking their emotions to being unable to overcome small issues. The cake cutting""To me the biggest sign is the cake cutting,"" one photographer revealed. ""Some people like to smear the cake everywhere as a joke, some people don't. Usually the couple is in sync about this. Sometimes one of them will force cake all over the others face and embarrass and upset them. I've seen this happen a handful of times and all of those relationships that I have kept up with have ended in a divorce.""(via)The way they treat each other""You can tell somewhat based on how the couple treats each other on the wedding day,"" another said. ""If they are respectful toward one another (and toward me) during a day full of stress, then I think that’s a good indicator of being able to deal with other problems that may arise during a marriage.""(via) If one of them is very quiet compared to the other ""Typically I see red flags when the bride or groom is super quiet. I mean silent and just watching. One instance was a groom who barely said ten words to anyone during the ceremony or reception afterwards — I dropped off the photo bundle with them two weeks later and he was still quiet. The bride complained about all of the pictures because the groom wasn’t 'smiling enough', and wanted a discount because I couldn’t make him look happy.""(via) If they aren't on the same team when things go wrong""It was pretty easy to tell which couples were going to last and which ones would soon be divorced,"" another commented. ""The main behavior differentiating the two was whether they were on the same team, helping each other and lifting each other up in the face of the inevitable problems and stress that come with weddings.

Panama City police tell news outlets that the employees were unable to wake 24-year-old Jordyn Freeman and 27-year-old Randy McMillin, both of whom were under the influence of drugs.

Police say two 9-month-old children were also found in the van, along with drugs and drug paraphernalia. They say one of the twins was covered in blankets and pillows.

Police say the soiled children were given clean clothes and diapers and placed with the state Department of Children and Families.

947,"Southwood strides: Florida High, St. John Paul II sight shining moment","The Seminoles won an 11-3 baseball game against the Panthers on Tuesday night

The “Battle of Southwood,” if you will, had a jovial, laidback feel.

Tuesday night’s baseball game between host St. John Paul II and neighboring Florida High was more relaxed than rivalrous. Much of that was related to the younger rosters that both teams threw on the diamond.

After building a 7-0 lead against St. JPII and winning 11-3, Florida High is 10-5 on the year. The Panthers dropped to 5-6.

“We just want to come out here every day and have fun and compete the best we can,” St. John Paul II senior Joey Silvestri, who got the pitching start Thursday when the Panthers hosted NFC in a district game. “We’ll play our hardest. It’s a fun match-up playing them. Hopefully we can get them next time when we play them in a couple weeks.”

While youth may be a dominant feature of both St. John Paul II’s and Florida High’s rosters, each school is trying to create a signature moment this season.

“I really want us to come in second in the district,” Panthers senior Logan Roberts said. “NFC is a really good team, and to be honest I don’t see us beating them, but we can put up a fight. And we can try to beat Maclay. If we did that, it would be really nice.”

BASEBALL PREVIEW: State title or bust for loaded North Florida Christian

For Florida High, a recent 10-8 loss to Pensacola Catholic showed the potential the Seminoles have even while starting five freshmen.

“We should have beat them,” Seminoles junior infielder and pitcher A.J. Thorp said. “We beat ourselves that game. We gave up too many runs, had too many errors, got picked off. We ran ourselves off.

“They’re a very beatable team and we have the team to beat them.”

If Florida High would have spoken that way last year, it would have come from cockiness, not legit confidence. But the vibe in the dugout this season is loose, and shots are directed at opponents’ pitches, not teammates.

“We have a lot better leadership this year than last year,” Thorp said. “Last year, everybody cared about themselves. We’re not as talented as last year, but we’re more of a team.

“We’ve done a lot of team bonding off the field. We’ve gotten closer as a team. It shows up on the field when we work hard and just have fun.”

Senior Brady Blackburn, who catches, pitches and plays in the infield, concurred. He’s been starting since he was a freshman, but he’s hopeful that an offseason spent in team-building pays dividends.

His freshman year, the Seminoles didn’t get out of their district tournament.

His sophomore season resulted in a 17-11 record but losses in the district championship to Pensacola Catholic and a first-round playoff exit to Jacksonville Providence.Last year was a .500 season and season-ending losses to Catholic and Providence.

LAST YEAR: Silver anniversary: Florida High's Hollenbeck coaches for more than himself

“I think we’ve got our best chance to make it the farthest since I’ve been in the program,” Blackburn said. “It’s just a lot of hard work. We’ve put in a lot of work to build the team up, get a family feel. I think we have the skills to make it to state, if not win it.”

Buy Photo Florida High senior Brady Blackburn pitches as Florida High won 11-3 on the road at St. John Paul II on Tuesday, April 3, 2010. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Blackburn is hitting .300 in the early going. Thorp, is leading the team at .388. Senior Malachi Burke is hitting .370 and hit Florida High’s first home run this season when he deposited a moon shot over the right-field wall at St. John Paul II.

Others above .300 include freshman Boone Hosey at .357, junior Argene Lynn at .327, and junior Jack Murphy at .326.

It’s a capable group at the plate, but the confidence wasn’t there last year.

“The biggest thing is having your team’s back,” Blackburn said. “You can’t get down on each other. You can’t talk bad to each other. You have to be a family. You have to be close with one another. The skills – you can only do so much with skills.”

While Florida High isn’t letting much bother them, that does mean there aren’t time without focus. With a big lead entering the bottom of the seventh at St. JPII, Thorp could be heard telling teammates the game wasn’t over. The Panthers scratched across another run in the inning and threatened to score more.

Thorp, who was part of last summer’s Tallahassee-Babe Ruth’s 15U World Series championship team along with junior teammate Argene Lynn, and Blackburn, who was on TLBR 15U’s World Series runner-up team in 2016, have a sense of urgency the others don’t have.

“You have to stay on them, a lot,” Thorp said. “We’ve got some young guys that don’t have the experience of playing up. They haven’t gone through the last stretch of the season where you have to put it in another gear.”

The Seminoles’ pitching staff has also been solid with Thorp (2-2, 3.61 ERA), Murphy (3-0, 2.47), sophomore Noah Gelabert (3-1, 3.89), and freshman Jayce Kirkham (1-0, 1.70) eating up the majority of innings.

Now, it’s just a matter of putting it all together in a district with a longtime power like Catholic and a winnable remaining nine games of the regular season.

A 20-win season is not outside the realm of possibility if Florida High can play its best ball in two games against Rickards and another with the Crusaders preceding the district tournament.

“We’ve got a good team here,” Blackburn said. “I think we have a chance to make it pretty far.”

St. John Paul II has six regular-season games left after this week. Last year, the Panthers had the second-best season in school history when they went 17-8.

After graduating seven off a roster of 13, St. JPII has scrambled to fill its roster even as it has high-caliber carryovers in Silvestri and Roberts to lead a younger group.

The Panthers’ signature moment might just be achieving runner-up in a district where NFC (13-4) should hold the top seed. To do that, St. JPII would likely need to hang onto its current No. 3 seeding in a five-team district to force a win-or-go-home semifinal against Maclay (8-7) for a spot in the regional playoffs.

Roberts, who came right off winning a state championship in basketball into the baseball season, tripled and scored two runs against Florida High. His average is up to .281 after a predictably slow start.

“My first day back, wow, the practices were way more laid back,” Roberts said. “Then I had to come back and hit right away and it was rough. I wasn’t timed up. It took some time getting used to it, but I’m there now.

“Pitching around me happens a lot, but as the leader of the team, I just try to make sure the guys are up, happy, and make sure the team morale is high.”

Junior Alex Ware is hitting .433, and Silvestri (2-1, 3.33 ERA) is at .367 as the Panthers try to establish more fight in their game.

They’re going to need it.

“We started slow (against Florida High), but the last four or five innings we played them even,” Silvestri said. “We just started slow, which we have been doing. We have a bunch of young guys.

“We need to get after it early. It’s just a lesson we’re learning and hopefully by the end of the year we’ll have it mastered.”

949,Three main suspects in 2017 massage parlor sting in Southwest Florida enter guilty pleas,"CLOSE Robert Neil Jones, 69, his wife, Xuan Lang, 49, and her brother, Jun Lang, 41, agreed to plea deals Wednesday, April 3, 2019 in Lee County Circuit Court. Ricardo Rolon, Fort Myers News-Press

Judge J. Frank Porter turned to Robert Neil Jones in court Wednesday and asked the Naples resident, ""Are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty?"" Jones, 69, after a look at his attorney, said simply, ""Yes.""

Jones was among three main suspects arrested in a 2017 statewide massage parlor sting to plead guilty to multiple charges, including racketeering and money laundering.

Two of the suspects could face deportation when they appear for sentencing.

Jones, his wife, Xuan Lang, 49, and her brother, Jun Lang, 41, agreed to plea deals in Lee County Circuit Court stemming from the June 6, 2017, raids across Collier, Lee, Sarasota, Manatee and Leon counties.

(Photo: Ricardo Rolon/The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Jones and the Langs were among more than a dozen women and two men who were arrested in the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Operation Spa on a variety of racketeering, prostitution and other charges at more than a dozen spas and massage parlors in Naples, Cape Coral, Sarasota, Bradenton and Tallahassee.

Wednesday's court action was originally listed as a motions hearing.

However, attorneys for both sides told Porter there was a plea agreement in the works and the circuit court judge gave the parties extra time to complete the agreement's details before reconvening the case about an hour later.

A language issue with the Langs that necessitated the use of a translator who spoke Mandarin Chinese also extended the hearing.

Jones, who was described by the FDLE as the head of the operation, plead guilty to four charges: Conduct of or participating in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; use or investment of proceeds from a pattern of racketeering activity; conspiracy to commit racketeering, and money laundering.

After Jones answered Porter's guilt question, the judge warned him that if he violated any of the plea agreement provisions he would be eligible for at least a 10-year prison term.

Xuan Lang, also known as ""Jessica"" or ""Coco"" and represented by Attorney Gerald Berry, plead guilty to one count of money laundering.

Jun Lang, also known as ""Jake"" and who had been behind bars since the arrests, also plead guilty to the same four counts as Jones.

As part of the plea deal Jun Lang agreed to give up title of a residence at 2355 Butterfly Palm Drive in Naples.

All three waived their rights to appeal and pre-sentencing investigations as part of the plea agreement.

Sentencing for Jun Lang will be June 6. The agreement said that Jun Lang, who has been jailed since his arrest, will have satisfied a 24-month jail term as of his sentencing date.

However, he could face deportation at that hearing, State Prosecuting Attorney Audra Eth said. She added that the state could make no promises about what might happen in any deportation action.

If deported, she said, Jun Lang's plea would not be cancelled.

Sentencing was deferred for Jones and Xuan Lang until Oct. 24 to give the couple time to attend their daughter's college graduation in California. The couple also needed to divest themselves of corporate entities and properties connected to the spa operations, part of their plea deal.

A number of the corporations the couple are part of — Spa 88 LLC, Spa 99 LLC, Esalen LLC, Landlord LLC — also entered guilty pleas and will be liquidated as part of the plea deals.

The plea agreement also mandated that Jones and his wife must have permission from the court to leave the 20th or 12th Judicial Circuits or Florida. The GPS monitor that Xuan Lang had been wearing was ordered removed after the plea deal was made.

Jones and Xuan Lang are listed as registered agents at 14 of the 16 spas targeted by the FDLE in 2017. Xuan Lang is also listed in FDLE documents as owner of seven of the spas and Jun Lang, as an registered ambassador of five.

Xuan Lang would also be subject to deportation proceedings, Eth said.

All of the attorneys and defendants involved Wednesday declined to comment.

Operation Spa got underway in November 2015 with help from the Collier County Sheriff's Office, Sarasota Police Department, Manatee County Sheriff's Office, Leon County Sheriff's Flan Office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency and Homeland Security.

A number of other suspects are awaiting sentencing.

Some of those arrested have already been sentenced.

Xiajuan Yu, 44, of Naples, was sentenced Jan. 28 to time served after she agreed to plead guilty to one count of residing in a place for the purpose of assignation. She relinquished her passport and Florida massage license and ordered to have no contact with other principals in the case.

958,Authorities continue search for Springfield missing man,"Authorities continue search for Springfield missing man Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Video

SPRINGFIELD, Fla. -- A Springfield man has been missing for eight days now and police are bringing in extra help to locate the longtime resident.

The man, 62-year-old, Felton Warren was last seen on April 12th leaving his home located on 5th street between Helen Avenue and Sanders Lane around 9:30 in the morning.

Since then, Springfield Police have been searching on their own but brought in reinforcements on Saturday. Around 40 members of the Bay County Search and Rescue team as well as the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission were part of the large scale search.

""This was the first day we could do that we were able to get a coordinated effort together. We didn't want to put anything together haphazardly. We wanted to make sure it was coordinated and we can make sure we can check all the areas as best as possible,"" said Lieutenant Russell Voyles with the Springfield Police Department.

The group split up into seven teams and took on different areas.

Voyles said, ""We have a large residential area around his home. We're mainly going to have walkers there. We're going to have some people checking out abandoned houses again and then the handlers with human remain dogs will be searching this area around Martin Lake. There's a large wooded area here behind Everett Middle School and Springfield Elementary and then there are a couple of other wooded areas we're going to search as well.""

With family on hand for the day, they say Warren wasn't quite himself leading up to the disappearance.

""He was stressed out the last time I'd seen him. Just down. Depressed,"" said his sister Shirley Lusk.

Voyles says Warren also had a few health complications. ""He potentially had a stroke in the last couple months and he also had a head injury a month, month and a half ago.""

The family still has a lot of unanswered questions but thankful for the support they have received.

""It's amazing. How many people showed up. I just want to thank them so much. This means so much to us and I know the lord's got him,"" said Warren's sister Elizabeth Goodwin.

The teams started their search around 10:00 Saturday morning and closed down around 4:00 in the afternoon.

Voyles says they are now going to review more leads and hopefully schedule another large scale search soon.

Warren is still missing.

960,Blackfin tuna fishing regulations are coming,"JOHN MENTINK/CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Blake Behrsin caught this 30-pound blackfin tuna Monday in 120 feet of water off St. Lucie Inlet while drifting a live bait with Capt. John Mentink.

Got wasabi?

When an offshore angler sees that familiar silver and black color in the water column — the kind of color that indicates a blackfin tuna is on the other end of the line — it's pretty much smiles all around.

""Get the gaff!"" is often shouted by he who sees it first.

The chunky football-sized and shaped sushi is promptly placed on ice in the fish box. They certainly are good eating. Never pass up a blackfin tuna steak or a chance to sample a fresh slice of sushi.

Along much of Florida's coastline, blackfin tuna are considered an incidental catch by recreational anglers. They are often caught when anglers are using techniques designed target dolphin (mahi mahi) or sailfish. Sometimes blackfin tuna can be encountered in large schools feeding in a frenzy as they corral a pod of bait fish like sardines or tinker mackerel near the surface. A couple of well-cast popper plugs or small spoons will generally result in hookups of the fast-swimming bullet-shaped blackfins.

Until recently, blackfin tuna were thought to be one of those species of bluewater fish no one ever had to worry about. It seemed as if there would be an unending supply of sushi, sashimi and pan-seared ginger, soy and sesame crusted tuna steaks.

But declining catches in spots where the fish is typically caught in large numbers has some recreational anglers and charter boat captains concerned. While blackfin tuna can be encountered in all of Florida's offshore waters, there has been an observed drop-off of catches in the Florida Keys and offshore of Miami, according to staff with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the state's rule-making body for saltwater fishing regulations.

As a result, the FWC is presently hosting a series of workshops to receive comments from anglers about the status of blackfin tuna. After collecting comments, FWC staff will present its findings to the 7-member governor-appointed commission most likely in mid-July when the commission meets in Stuart.

Until any changes are made, blackfin tuna are currently regulated by Florida’s default recreational bag limit of 100 pounds or two fish per day, whichever is greater, in state waters. There is no existing size limit. I've even seen photos of some no larger than my hand someone kept once, which may have been legal, but perhaps not ethical. There are no regulations for blackfin tuna in federal waters.

Blackfin tuna are one of the smaller species of the tuna family, the smallest, in fact of the ""true tunas."" They are not like their gigantic 1,000-pound bluefin tuna cousins, or even the yellowfin tuna which can grow to 400 pounds. They are similar to skipjack tuna and false albacore, or what is most commonly called bonito in Florida waters, and a big one might weigh in at close to 20 pounds. Often, these species can be found together mixed in schools as they feed on smaller fish.

Got wasabi? According to Capt. Patrick Price of DayMaker charters in Stuart, the blackfin tuna are running along the Treasure Coast. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY MATT TILFORD)

Most caught are probably within the 12-15 pound range. The Florida state record blackfin tuna was a whopper — 45 pounds, 8 ounces, caught May 4, 1996 by Sam J. Burnett off Key West.

Their distribution ranges from Massachusetts to Brazil, but unlike the bluefin tuna, they do not engage in long migratory journeys and never cross the Atlantic Ocean. In fact, there has been some scientific research which suggests there is not much movement by blackfin tuna between the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic, unlike king mackerel and cobia.

What is interesting, according to FWC data, recreational anglers are responsible for 95-98 percent of the harvest of blackfin tuna stocks. Most directed trips yield 2-3 blackfin tuna catches.

According to some charter boat captains in the Florida Keys, scenes like this have been too common and are resulting in a decline in blackfin tuna (right side) catches. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY GARRETT DOWNEY)

The FWC does a great job of managing dozens of species of fish and wildlife in one of the nation's most populated states. It's process is to involve those who have a stake in what they enjoy fishing and hunting for.

What would blackfin tuna regulations look like? There could be a bag limit of one or two fish. There could be a size limit of a minimum of 20 or 24 inches. State regulations would also likely extend into federal waters. But these measures need angler input.

Attend one of the final three workshops, if possible, or at least review the material online at submit comments there. I'm said this before, be part of the process if it matters to you, or else I don't want to hear your complaints on social media or at the dock.

961,Why do Southerners go bananas for banana pudding? | Southern Perspective,"While there's nothing more ""Southern"" about banana pudding than ""Northern"" or ""Western,"" it's known nationwide as just so. As close as I can tell from my research — scant as it may be when put up against the meaning of the word ""research"" — we liked it, so we took it.

It's not as bad as it sounds. It's not like there were other regions waiting to catch us in a dark alley and take it back. I think no one else cared. We are down here rather known for liking what we like. Good for us, I say.

One of the reasons it could be called a red-headed stepchild of desserts is that most people make banana pudding with packaged goods like pudding mix, whipped topping and vanilla wafer cookies. If making it from scratch was the only option, it might be a different story, because culinary skill could come into play and separate the cooks from the wanna-bes. Whatever the reason, it's ours. Yay!

Five years: Reflecting on Southern Perspective — the food, the history, the quirky stuff

Buzz, buzz: Gulf Coast solitary bee needs our help to survive

Now, I must confess that bananas aren't my favorite part of the dessert. I usually push them to the side while I nom-nom on the pudding, whipped topping and cookies. So why do I bother with the bananas at all? Well, the dish usually isn't mine or I might not.

The problem with the bananas is that they get slimy. Sure, putting a spritz of lemon juice on them delays them getting brown, but it doesn't fix texture. After even a couple of hours encased in that wet, gloppy goodness, bananas no longer ""feel"" fresh to me. Get the slime under control, and I'm all in. I realize most people don't share my weird, little issue.



I like raw bananas, which didn't become commonly available to Americans until after the Civil War, when getting them here by boat got easier. Then, by the late 1800s, the dessert was already popular using sponge cake and custard. By the mid-1900s, home cooks were altering their dishes for convenience using packaged foods. Now, most of the recipes and articles about banana pudding are seen in Southern-based publications.

I'll make a final point to right a wrong in banana pudding history. Many people credit Nabisco for adding its Vanilla Wafers (not Nilla Wafers yet) to the recipe and putting it on the box as a marketing tool. Robert Moss, a food writer for Serious Eats website, reports while Nabisco executives capitalized on a trend, they didn't create it. Individual cooks had been publishing recipes and articles featuring vanilla wafers for 20 years.

We're now well into the 21st century and still eating banana pudding, or rather non-banana banana pudding if you're me, which I am. Do you want my bananas?

GINNY BEAGAN Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

It's an effective vaccine that can ward off a potentially fatal disease for up to 30 years.

But it's not a vaccine that's required for school admission, and it's merely on the ""recommended"" list for infants. Some health experts would like to see that change.

""One set of shots could protect you the rest of your life"" for adults who take the Hepatitis A vaccination, said Dr. Vishwas Vanar, a professor at the University of Central Florida and an expert in the disease that has reached epidemic levels in parts of the Treasure Coast and other areas of Florida.

""It's not required for infants, but it needs to be,"" Vanar said of the vaccine.

Ten of the 811 reported cases of hepatitis A in Florida since Jan. 1 were fatal.

""It's a common disease in other parts of the world, but it's not common here and it's unusual for deaths to occur,"" Vanar said.

That's why he advocates for everyone to take the vaccine. He especially recommends it for pregnant mothers or people with weaker immune systems.

The Hepatitis A vaccine can last 20 to 30 years, Vanar said. Blood testing can be done to confirm if someone still has immunity to the virus from their shot, he said.

""As our cultural diversity grows, there's an increased risk to import Hepatitis A"" from parts of the world where it is more common, Vanar said.

It's only been since the turn of the century the Hepatitis A vaccine joined the list of recommended vaccines for infants, said Dr. Marc McCain, a pediatrician who owns Treasure Coast Pediatrics in Vero Beach.

He's been practicing there for 15 years and has always required his patients to include Hepatitis A as part of their immunizations.

""I want to protect all the children in this community,"" said McCain, a Vero Beach native. ""Some kids are't able to get the vaccine because of various medical concerns. I have to worry about every child in my office, not just the ones who are fully vaccinated. I don't want a child to get exposed.""

Many other pediatricians are also requiring new patients to get the vaccine, McCain said. It's just a matter of time before the state adds it to the school immunization list.

""It will take someone in the Legislature to make that happen,"" McCain said. ""Will this outbreak in Martin County be the catalyst?""

In Martin, the Department of Health is giving out Hepatitis A shots to residents who are uninsured, underinsured or are considered at-risk for the disease, spokeswoman Renay Rouse said. The vaccine is given in two shots six months apart, she said.

In Florida, vaccines required for public schools, private schools and daycare centers include Hepatitis B, measles, chicken pox, polio and tetanus. Those are also on the recommended list for infants.

In Orlando, Walt Disney World had a couple of incidents of Hepatitis A diagnoses the last several months. An employee at Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort was diagnosed with the virus in January. And in November, a food service worker at Morimoto Asia restaurant at Disney Springs was diagnosed.

State Rep. Toby Overdorf (R, Palm City) said Florida Department of Health officials confirmed no food workers or food handlers in Martin County have been found to have the virus.

964,Ancestry.com removes ad romanticizing slavery,"Copyright by WFLA - All rights reserved

(WFLA/CNN Newsource) – Ancestry.com is apologizing for an advertisement that critics said romanticized slavery.

The video ad aired on television and was posted to YouTube.

It depicted a white man in the 1800s asking a black woman to escape to the north with him.

The man holds a ring in his left fingers.

As the video ends, a “marriage certificate” appears on the screen, saying the couple portrayed wed in Canada in 1857.

The ad was criticized for evoking images of slavery in the United States and a time when black women were subjugated and raped by white slave owners.

The DNA testing company said in a statement, “Ancestry is committed to telling important stories from history. This ad was intended to represent one of those stories. We very much intended to represent one of those stores. We very much appreciate the feedback we have received and apologize for any offense that the ad may have caused.”",http://www.wfla.com/news/viral-news/ancestrycom-removes-ad-romanticizing-slavery/1939548413,2019-04-19T21:14:28Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

966,Golden Gate Nursery grows with every decade; started in '80s by Cuban immigrants,"CLOSE Golden Gate Nursery off Collier Boulevard has provided landscapers and gardeners with native Florida plants and flowers for more than 30 years. Ashley Collins, ashley.collins@naplesnews.com; 239-213-6029

Before Golden Gate Nursery became the full-service garden center it is today, it was a lone bright-red shack selling homegrown tropical flowers and plants in rural Collier County.

This was back in the '80s before Collier Boulevard adopted its name, says Rufino Hernandez, who co-owns the nursery with his brother Jorge Hernandez Sr., 57.

Then, the boulevard was a two-lane road surrounded by undeveloped land, except for the small shack, which was first opened as a nursery in 1984 by their parents Rosa and Ruben Hernandez Sr. They fled to Naples from Cuba in the early '60s to escape communism.

More about Naples' palms: Naples has almost 15,000 city palm trees — here's what that looks like.

“At that time there were hardly any Hispanics living in town,"" Rufino Hernandez, 51, said. As a result, he added, his father earned the nickname ""Ruben the Cuban.""

He recalls his parents worked various jobs before opening the nursery in Golden Gate. Ruben Hernandez always had a love for gardening and turned his passion into a business in which he would pass down his knowledge to the next two generations of his family.

Over the span of more than 30 years, the family-owned-and-operated nursery gradually expanded from five to 20 acres in order to meet the demands of a growing community, which isn't so quiet and rural anymore.

Retail plazas and housing developments surround the nursery situated on Collier Boulevard between Vanderbilt Beach and Immokalee roads.

The center features an indoor retail space selling everything from garden supplies to animal feed and an outdoor nursery with a wide assortment of flowering plants, palm and citrus trees and pottery.

Rufino Hernandez said he learned everything about the business from his father. He and his brother Jorge took over the family business in 2004.

The original red shack was torn down years ago when the boulevard was expanded, and in its place a large, green building was built with a wooden porch, which opens out to a beautifully landscaped garden of multi-colored pots, statues and flowers right on the boulevard.

But Ruben Hernandez's memory, and that of the bright-red shack from years ago, live on through a large wall mural, which greets customers as they walk inside the nursery's retail space.

The colorful mural is of a photo taken of Ruben Hernandez and his oldest son Ruben Hernandez Jr., who passed away years ago. They both smile as they pose for a photo behind the register inside the original nursery.

Rufino Hernandez hopes to honor their mother Rosa, who died last year, by adding her in the mural. ""She was our matriarch,” he said.

His nephew, JJ ""Jorge"" Hernandez Jr., 39, learned the business from his grandparents and manages the nursery alongside his father.

""It's a big operation,"" he said as he drove a golf cart around the premises on a sunny weekday afternoon, helping customers pick out plants.

When he was younger, he distanced himself from the family business and worked in the recording industry as a studio engineer. But like his father and uncle before him, he was determined to continue his family's legacy.

The fact that the nursery is a family affair is one of the reasons it has stayed successful for so long, Rufino Hernandez said. That and the relationships they've cultivated over time with the community.

""We listen to what people want and always keep good stock and inventory and try to differentiate ourselves from a big-box store.

“We also pride ourselves on a cool selection of plants. Obviously, we have things that everyone wants but we also have unique and different things that you won’t find anywhere else.""

That includes a variety of garden tools, citrus trees (grapefruit, lemon and lime) and both local and imported outdoor decor from places like Haiti.

The nursery sometimes feels like a zoo with small birds and talkative parrots, housed in large cages, and two rescue cats, Willow and Tito, who roam freely around the retail shop during business hours.

While the family used to grow their own plants and flowers, now they get much of their live products from agricultural areas across Florida like Homestead, a Miami suburb.

The Hernandez family also owns another business in town called the Garden District, a flower shop near downtown Naples that caters to weddings and other special occasions.

As the nursery nears its 40th anniversary, only a couple of years away, the Hernandez family plans to renovate its retail space over the summer to keep it fresh for the next decade to come.

967,'Home Rule' often violates the rule of law | Opinion,"Burnie Thompson (Photo: Your Turn)

How many city commissioners does it take to ban a light bulb in Florida?

Only three in most cases, a simple majority (depending on how many members sit on the board).

These local politicians can ban your entire business as well. Or have you arrested for drinking beer on the beach. Or make it too painful and expensive to acquire an occupational license to earn a living and practice your craft. The list goes on and on.

What’s worse is that local governments can do it all year long. Supporters of this arbitrary tyranny call it ""Home Rule."" And it has become such a problem that state lawmakers are targeting this abuse and threatening to yank the rug out from under local governments.

Residents and business owners are being abused by local politicians across the state.

A judge slapped a restraining order on the Miami Beach City Commission for attacking owners of short-term rental properties. Panama City Beach is being sued by scooter companies for outlawing rentals, even though the state recognizes scooters as street-legal vehicles.

Home Rule has allowed local governments to regulate activities not already governed by the state for about 40 years. But lately local politicians have been passing ordinances attacking our leftover freedoms like sharks at a feeding frenzy.

Proponents of Home Rule are slick. They present it as local government protecting us against out-of-touch state lawmakers.

Not true.

Local ordinances don’t supersede state statutes. That’s just basic civics. Local governments can’t resist state laws and make us more free. Instead, they do just the opposite. Home Rule gives local governments authority to pass more laws and make us less free.

Yet another layer of laws and taxation against the people is no virtue, even if it comes from local government.

Home Rule violates the rule of law, because Floridians can’t possibly know how to comport ourselves from city to city if the laws are different everywhere we go.

And the threat of Home Rule is ever-present. It only takes a handful of local politicians to pass new ordinances every couple weeks year-round to change the rules and ruin your business.

The Florida Legislature is working to stop this kind of abuse, and remove legal barriers imposed by local governments.

It’s important to note that state lawmakers have less opportunity to pass new laws than local politicians because they only convene once a year for a couple months. Bills have to go through several committees and need matching bills in both chambers. If legislators pass a bill, it then goes to the governor to sign or veto it.

This burdensome process makes it much harder for the state to pass new laws than it is for local governments. And considering most laws don’t expand freedom or protect the family budget, that’s a good thing.

971,"Couple passed out in vehicle while toddler wanders around parking lot naked, police say","- Police officers and IHOP employees in one Florida city worked together to care for three children whose parents were passed out in their vehicle.

The City of Panama City posted on their Facebook page that around 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning, IHOP employees noticed a toddler with no clothes wandering around their parking lot. They also noticed a van in the parking lot with two adults passed out inside. The employees were reportedly unable to wake the adults up. They went on to wrap the toddler up in an apron.

The adults, identified as 24-year-old Jordyn Freeman and 27-year-old Randy McMillin of Ohio, were both said to be under the influence of drugs. Officers could even see the drugs inside the van. They also found nine-month-old twins in the van. One of them was covered with blankets and pillows.

The Facebook post by the City of Panama City went on to state that the three children appeared to be in good health but needed clean clothes and diapers. Responding officers helped care for the children by changing their clothing while IHOP employees gave them pancakes.

The Department of Children and Families (DCF) responded to the scene and reportedly took custody of the children. Both Freeman, the mother of the children, and McMillin, the mother's fiancé, were taken to the Bay County Jail. They are being charged with Child Neglect, Possession of Methamphetamine, and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.

The City of Panama City wants to remind citizens that suspected child abuse or neglect should be reported to the Panama City Police Department at 850-872-3100 or the DCF Hotline at 1-800-96-ABUSE.

972,Interactive map shows where Florida's nuisance alligators are,"Watch out for increased alligator activity as the weather warms.

April is alligator courting season, which means the frisky crocodilians may be venturing out more in the hopes of finding a companion before mating season begins in earnest in May and June.

With an estimated 1.3 million alligators in Florida, the state's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is warning the public to be aware of the increase in alligator activity this time of year and the possibilities of encountering them.

And don't think the prehistoric predators are confined to wildlife areas. A map of where nuisance alligators have been removed includes all areas of the state, from Pensacola to the Keys. And there's plenty of activity documented in Polk County.

""They can literally be in any puddle of water,"" said Boynton Beach resident Richard Cochran, who removed nuisance alligators for the state until last year when an unrelated back injury sidelined him. ""Not to scare people, but there are over a million of them and they are all around.""

Statewide, 6,700 nuisance alligators were killed or relocated in 2017. That increased to 7,114 last year, according to FWC data.

Areas with the highest removals are in and around Tampa, Sarasota, Orlando, Fort Myers and Jacksonville. Tampa topped the list in 2017 with 181 nuisance gators but was bested last year by Sarasota, which tallied 205.

West Palm Beach and its suburbs racked up a total of 205 removals over the past two years, with 139 taken from Wellington and 77 from Palm Beach Gardens.

Even tiny Palm Beach had at least one removed during the same time period when a wayward gator found itself on the beach side of the Intracoastal.

""They've been at people's front doors, in retention ponds, swimming pools,"" Cochran said. ""Pools aren't uncommon. They just push through the screen and off they go.""

American alligators are no longer an endangered species, but are protected under a classification that allows only people with special licenses and permits to take them.

That means Floridians can't just call up the local alligator trapper to remove one like they would if it were a raccoon or possum.

Instead, the FWC operates the Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program, where people can report a suspicious gator. The FWC decides whether it poses a risk and will then assign a trapper that it contracts with and licenses.

Cochran said if a nuisance gator is 4 feet or longer and the trapper doesn't have a special permit to take it alive, it's usually killed. Otherwise, nuisance gators can be sold to an alligator farm.

""I don't like to kill them, and I had a license not to for a couple of years. I found it more enjoyable to be good to them,"" he said.

Over the past decade, Florida has averaged seven unprovoked alligator bites to humans per year that are serious enough to require medical treatment. From 1948 through 2008, 410 unprovoked bites have occurred, with 25 ending in the person's death.

One of the people killed was 10-year-old Bradley Weidenhamer, who died after he was attacked by a 400-pound alligator on the Loxahatchee River in 1993.

In June 2016, 2-year-old Lane Graves died after he was snatched from the shore of a Disney World resort by an alligator. Six alligators were killed following the boy's death.

Two years later in June 2018, an alligator killed 47-year-old Plantation resident Shizuka Matsuki while she walked her dogs in Davie's Silver Lakes Rotary Nature Park.

""When temperatures rise, an alligator's metabolism increases and they begin seeking prey,"" an FWC press release says. Although alligator bite incidents resulting in serious injury are rare in Florida, the FWC recommends taking precautions when having fun in and around the water.

977,The Latest: Montez Sweat's wait finally ended by Washington,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) "" The Latest on the NFL draft (all times EDT):

11:30 p.m.

Montez Sweat's wait has ended thanks to the Washington Redskins trading up with Indianapolis to grab the Mississippi State pass rusher at No. 26.

Sweat had been rated as a potential top-10 pick before reports of a heart condition found during the NFL combine in February. He originally had committed to attend the NFL draft in Nashville before deciding last weekend to celebrate with his family in Stone Mountain, Georgia.

Indianapolis received Washington's second-round pick at No. 46 overall and a second-round pick in 2020 in the deal.

General manager Chris Ballard got a pair of starters in the second round last year with linebacker Darius Leonard and right tackle Braden Smith.

The Oakland Raiders used their third and final pick in the first round on defense, taking safety Johnathan Abram from Mississippi State. They used two of those selections on defense after grabbing defensive end Clelin Ferrell of Clemson fourth overall.

The Los Angeles Chargers took Notre Dame defensive tackle Jerry Tillery at No. 28, making him the ninth defensive lineman taken in the first round.

11:10 p.m.

The Houston Texans want to protect Deshaun Watson better, and they took the first player from a non-Football Bowl Subdivision school to help their offensive line.

The Texans drafted tackle Tytus Howard at No. 23 out of Alabama State. The 6-foot-5 can only help a line that gave up a league-worst 62 sacks last season despite winning the AFC South title.

Josh Jacobs became the first running back drafted with Oakland also making him the third Alabama player selected at No. 24.

Baltimore stuck with the run on offensive players and drafted wide receiver Marquise Brown out of Oklahoma, giving quarterback Lamar Jackson a very speedy and shifty target. Brown was an AP All-American last season at Oklahoma with Kyler Murray, though he faced questions about his size at 166 pounds and a foot injury that kept him from running at the combine.

___

10:50 p.m.

John Elway traded for Joe Flacco earlier this offseason, and now he's giving his new quarterback a healthy tight end in Noah Fant.

He's now the second tight end taken in this draft and will be a welcome option as Flacco settles in with the Broncos.

Denver has Jake Butts, but he has played just three games in his first two seasons because of ACL injuries.

The Green Bay Packers are working hard to improve their defense. After taking defensive end Rashan Gary at No. 12, the Packers traded up to No. 21 from 30th overall to select speedy safety Darnell Savage Jr. of Maryland. The Packers obviously like the safety who ran a 4.36-second 40-yard dash at the combine in February.

The Seahawks now will pick at No. 30 and also added a pair of fourth-round selections at Nos. 114 and 118 in the deal.

Baltimore traded down three spots with Philadelphia, and the Eagles used the 22nd pick on a big offensive tackle in Andre Dillard as a possible heir apparent for Jason Peters who's now 37. The Ravens picked up selections No. 125 in the fourth round and No. 197 in the sixth round.

___

10:30 p.m.

Dexter Lawrence has become the third Clemson defensive player taken in the first 17 selections of the NFL draft.

The New York Giants picked Lawrence at No. 17 to help their defense after drafting a quarterback in Daniel Jones at No. 6. Lawrence joins Clelin Ferrell taken by Oakland and Christian Wilkins drafted by Miami despite being one of three on the Tigers' roster to test positive for a banned substance called ostarine. Wilkins was suspended from Clemson's bowl game along with the other two players and also missed the national championship game.

Carolina also stayed with the defensive theme of the first round, taking Florida State edge rusher Brian Burns at No. 16. Tennessee gambled by taking defensive tackle Jeffrey Simmons from Mississippi State at No. 19 despite him tearing his left ACL in February.

Minnesota took the seventh offensive player of the round with the 18th pick, selecting center Garrett Bradbury from North Carolina State.

___

10:20 p.m.

Kyler Murray, like so many NFL draft picks, took to social media to celebrate.

He also made some coin while doing it.

The Heisman Trophy winner went to Twitter twice shortly after the Arizona Cardinals selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft. Both tweets were sponsored; one by Madden20 the other by Panini Instant.

""What an amazing night,"" said in his first tweet shortly after being drafted. ""Can't wait to join my @AZCardinals teammates and get started. Check out my #NFLDraft card now on #PaniniInstant.""

""You know it's official once you hit #Madden20!"" he tweeted about an hour later. ""I can't wait to get on the sticks #EAathlete.""

Call it a sign of the times.

___

10:10 p.m.

The dominance of defensive players in the first round of the draft subsided for a couple of picks when Atlanta bolstered a weak offensive line with Boston College guard Chris Lindstrom. Just behind that, Washington showed that patience is, indeed a virtue, and got Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins.

Lindstrom should move directly into the starting lineup for the Falcons, who desperately need an upgrade up front. Haskins, at one point regarded as the top quarterback in this crop, might not be an immediate starter for the Redskins, who acquired Case Keenum in the offseason with starter Alex Smith and backup Colt McCoy both coming off broken legs.

But Washington had targeted Haskins, stayed put instead of trading up, and got him.

___

10 p.m.

New York Giants fan Greg Hampton has won two season tickets for the team for the next century.

As part of the NFL's celebration of its 100th season, which begins in September, the league held a contest that drew about 5,000 entrants.

Hampton, 36, from the New York borough of Queens, was turned on to football by his father, and sent a letter to then-coach Tom Coughlin ""telling him about my dad and he was a big fan of his. He actually sent my dad a nice letter telling him to get well, and a signed photo. To me that meant the world. It shows that my favorite team cared about its fans as if they were family.""

Hampton's ill father passed away before seeing the letter.

He was one of three finalists and was announced as the winner onstage at the outset of the draft as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Pro Football Hall of Famers Joe Greene and Tim Brown, and Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota looked on.

""I plan to take both of my sons to games; will use my extra ticket for one son and buy another ticket for my other son,"" he said of Jaydon, 12, and Jordon, 10. ""My brother will get to be in the rotation sometimes, as well.'""

His sons did the contest submission.

Hampton travels to three or four home games a year, he said, as well as attending some games at MetLife Stadium.

9:50 p.m.

When Michigan linebacker-defensive end Rashan Gary was told he'd gone 12th overall to Green Bay, he broke down in tears at home. Gary, who has formed his own agency to represent athletes, is quick, strong and was a two-time All-Big Ten choice.

More defense ""and another lineman"" followed as Miami shored up its trenches with Clemson DE Christian Wilkins. He played four seasons for the Tigers and was a terror for several of them, making All-America. He had 53 tackles for no gain or a loss in his career.

___

9:39 p.m.

One spot after Pittsburgh jumped in front of them, the Cincinnati Bengals bolstered their offensive line by grabbing Alabama tackle Jonah Williams.

He can play either side of the line, is strong and mobile, and technically sound.

Just like Michigan linebacker Devin Bush, the player the Steelers traded up ahead of the Bengals, to get, Williams should be an immediate starter.

___

9:27 p.m.

The first trade of the 2019 NFL draft lifted Pittsburgh from 20th to 10th, swapping with Denver.

The Steelers, with all-time great Joe Greene making the announcement, then selected Michigan linebacker Devin Bush "" a player apparently coveted by AFC North rival Cincinnati at No. 11.

Denver now has the 20th spot, the 52nd overall pick, and a third-rounder in 2020.

Pittsburgh doesn't often make such bold moves in drafts, but after missing the playoffs last season, and with Ryan Shazier unlikely to play again because of a severe injury, getting Bush was a key to rebuilding the defense.

___

9:20 p.m.

Buffalo also shored up its defensive line with tackle Ed Oliver, a three-time All-AAC player who didn't have a great 2018 season after being dominant the previous years, including first-team All-America in 2016.

He had 50 tackles for loss or no gain in the past three years, leading FBS.

___

9:15 p.m.

Iowa tight end T.J. Hockenson, who seemed destined for Jacksonville before Josh Allen fell to the Jaguars, went at the eighth pick one spot later to Detroit.

Hockenson is an all-around tight end with blocking skills, speed and savvy. He finds open areas in defenses and doesn't drop the ball.

___

9:09 p.m.

Kentucky's Josh Allen, the national defensive player of the year (Bednarik Award) and a fast, physical linebacker, went to Jacksonville at the seventh spot.

The Jaguars have some significant needs on offense, but Allen generally was projected to go in the top five picks.

It's the second successive draft in which Josh Allen went seventh. Buffalo took the Wyoming quarterback by the same name in 2018.

___

9:04 p.m.

The Giants ended that mini-run of D-linemen when they took Duke quarterback Daniel Jones, who has learned under Blue Devils coach David Cutcliffe "" the same man who tutored Peyton and Eli Manning.

Jones was considered an outsider to go in the opening round until recently, and the Giants clearly feel he can do some more learning under Eli Manning before taking over as their signal caller.

Jones was the MVP of the Senior Bowl.

___

8:58 p.m.

Up next was Tampa Bay, which had a sieve of a defense last season. So the Buccaneers, with new coach Bruce Arians "" and offensive mastermind"" chose LSU linebacker Devin White, the Butkus Award winner who led the SEC in tackles.

He's exactly the kind of playmaker the unit has lacked for several years and had the highest percentage of pass pressures in FBS last year.

___

8:50 p.m.

Oakland, which owns three first-round spots, took the third straight defensive lineman in a draft loaded with them, selecting Clelin Ferrell of Clemson.

A two-time All-ACC player who has pass rushing skills on the edge, he is the first of several national champion Tigers likely to go very high from their outstanding D-line.

___

8:50 p.m.

The rain is really coming down in Nashville on the NFL draft now.

Nashville may be dodging the worst of thunderstorms and rain that had been predicted for much of Thursday. But not long after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced Kyler Murray as the No. 1 pick overall to Arizona, the rain started falling.

Fans packing Broadway next to the draft stage had no issues with the rain, wearing ponchos or having umbrellas and hats at the ready.

Rain is coming through the roof at the media center where approximately 2,000 reporters are covering the draft.

___

8:40 p.m.

The New York Jets held onto the third pick and took defensive tackle Quinnen Williams of Alabama, a dominant man in the trenches accustomed to playing in big games. The Jets were widely speculated to want to trade down, but instead got a building block for their defense and new coach Adam Gase.

Not even a starter before 2018, Williams won the Outland Trophy last season and is Alabama's highest-drafted defensive player since linebacker Cornelius Bennett went No. 2 overall in 1987.

___

8:30 p.m.

Ohio State edge rusher Nick Bosa went to San Francisco as expected. The 49ers have used a first-round selection on four defensive linemen in the past five drafts.

Bosa is considered the top pass rusher in this group. His older brother, Joey, plays for the Chargers and was the 2016 Defensive Rookie of the Year. Their father also played in the NFL.

Bosa is the highest Ohio State draft pick since offensive tackle Orlando Pace went No. 1 to St. Louis in 1997.

Bosa missed all but three games last season with a core muscle injury, but already had exhibited the kind of playmaking that lifts players to loft status. Such as the second pick in the draft.

___

8:25 p.m.

Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray is the first pick in the NFL draft, going to Arizona and immediately creating a quarterback quandary.

A year after the Cardinals traded up to the 10th spot to grab Josh Rosen, they went with Oklahoma's dynamic Heisman Trophy winner. The team apparently believes Murray is a better fit running the offense of new coach Kliff Kingsbury, who worked in the Big 12 that Murray dominated last season.

Murray is the second straight Sooners quarterback taken atop the draft, following another Heisman recipient, Baker Mayfield, who went to Cleveland last year. Mayfield had a superb rookie season, and the Cardinals can only hope Murray has a similar impact in the desert.

___

8:15 p.m.

The NFL draft has begun with Commissioner Roger Goodell accompanied by Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver Tim Brown, Hall of Fame defensive tackle Joe Greene and Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota.

They immediately presented the winner of a contest for two season tickets for the next 100 years as part of the NFL's celebration of its 100th season.

Giants fan Greg Hampton won the contest.

___

7 p.m.

While he's making no predictions about continued labor peace, Roger Goodell is encouraged that talks with the players' union have begun.

The 10-year collective bargaining agreement was reached in 2011 after a lockout of the players that lasted from March until midsummer. The NFL commissioner says mutual respect on both sides can lead to productive dialogue before the deal runs out in March 2021.

""The bottom line is we do have a CBA in place for close to eight years and it has worked very well for players, clubs, fans and the game,"" he told SiriusXM NFL Radio. ""These discussions are happening and hopefully we will get to a place where we can extend the deal in some format.

""When you have dialogue and understand each other and listen to each other, it's 'OK, how can we use this to have a better league?' Our league is better when we listen to opposing views.""

___

6:25 p.m.

The agent for Jaylon Ferguson says the potential first-round pick has spent much of Thursday helping people affected by a tornado that tore through Ruston, Louisiana, in the early morning hours.

Safarrah Lawson said Ferguson was going through neighborhoods making sure people who didn't have power had bottled water and other necessities. Lawson, who is also in Ruston, said Ferguson's family was safe but that the area he was staying in sustained some damage, including downed trees.

The tornado killed two people and Louisiana's governor has declared a state of emergency.

Ferguson played college football at Louisiana Tech, which is in Ruston. The 6-foot-5, 271-pound defensive end set the FBS record with 45 sacks.

___

5:15 p.m.

Hall of Fame-bound Kevin Mawae, a star center for the Tennessee Titans and, before them, the Jets and Seahawks, spoke as part of the Heart of a Hall of Famer program this week. Mawae appeared at Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, where he was a dean of students.

""It's not where you start the race; it's how you finish it,"" Mawae said as he told students how being involved in the draft can apply to life in general.

""You can start at the bottom, the middle, or even the top, but it is how you finish the race and run the race. A career is not a sprint; it's a marathon.""

The Heart of a Hall of Famer educational series provides students the opportunity to learn firsthand what it took beyond athletic ability for players to achieve success on and off the field. The program focuses on the Hall of Fame's core values of commitment, integrity, courage, respect and excellence.

Mawae will be inducted into the hall in August in Canton, Ohio.

982,Naples Philharmonic chorus leaders sing a new tune: their swan song,"Left, Brice Gerlach, Michelle Byrd and Jim Cochran (Photo: Harriet Howard Heithaus)

To outsiders, and doubtlessly to many insiders, the announcement that the Naples Philharmonic Chorus' three leaders are departing after next season threatens to chisel out its foundation.

James Cochran, founding director of the chorus, will have been at the helm for 29 years at the end of 2020. There's a cumulative 77 years of experience with the addition of its assistant director, Brice Gerlach, and Michelle Byrd, Cochran's administrative coordinator, singing skills coach and — as Cochran kids her — ""den mother"" to the youth chorus.

But there's no trepidation from the trio who led the chorus through its formative years, from 56 initial singers in the early 1990s to the 96 members today. They feel the stones for a solid structure are out there.

""We all just sort of agreed that it was a good thing to allow whoever takes over to have free rein to do whatever they want to do,""explained Byrd. ""I think it would be hard if Jim retired and we were still there. It would be hard for us to not play old tapes, and I think that's an unfair situation for a new person,""

So the the three will leave together at the end of the 2019-20 season. They'll go with the sound of a grand finale ringing in their ears: The season closes with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, one of the pinnacles of choral work.

All three have new goals

They're leaving with destinations in mind. For Cochran, it came with the acquisition of a new 3,485-pipe, 59-stop Lively-Fulcher pipe organ by Vanderbilt Presbyterian Church, where he is director of music, in 2017.

""I'd really like to spend some time on that,"" he said. ""I've really spent 30 years focused on choral stuff and all of my degrees are in organ performance.

""So I've got a stack of music that I want to perform before I croak, and I need to practice,"" Cochran declared.

""My health is fine, thank God. But I'm 63. My father died at 75. That's only 12 more years,"" he concluded. ""It's not the dress rehearsal any more. It's the real deal. ""

Gerlach and Byrd, who are married, have had a similar moment of reckoning. Their son, Colin, will be a high school senior in 2020.

""We'd like to have that last year where we have a little bit of time with him. Oftentimes he has events in the evening and we can't go to them because we're busy with chorus,"" Byrd said. They've seen him even less now that he's not part of the Philharmonic Youth Chorus, which the couple also works with.

Nor is taking over Cochran's position something Gerlach, its associate director, would consider with his own current workload.

""I'm full time as First Presbyterian Church music director. I'm adjunct professor of organ at Ave Maria University, running the Ave Maria Chamber Choir, teaching nine organ students and teaching conducting,"" Gerlach said.

""It is just so much more responsibility to lead than to be the assistant, and I'm already leading all these other things. So we thought it would be appropriate to step down together.""

It isn't, he added, an easy farewell: ""We've been a trio for so long. It's been 24 years now.""

Gerlach, in fact, knew Cochran as an upperclassman organ student when both were at the Eastman School of Music: ""It was just fortunate we ended up in the same town,"" Gerlach said.

Philharmonic's is the chorus that could

Their working partnership has lubricated a machine that runs constantly during the season. Many people know the chorus only from one set of concerts they may attend. But the Philharmonic Chorus sings at least six different programs per season:

The annual ""Messiah"" performance

At least one of the Pops Series concerts

A Masterworks performance

One ""run-out"" concert on either Marco Island or Bonita Springs

Two special concerts, the Holiday Pops and the Patriotic Pops

""Our schedule, quite honestly, is grueling, really. It's really a much bigger choral schedule than most in the country,"" Cochran said.

""When we do a pops concert, it's the entire week,"" Gerlach added. ""We start on Monday with rehearsal and go through every night to Saturday night or sometimes, a Sunday matinee.""

That doesn't always jibe with the fluctuating schedules of retired residents who""understandably want to spend time with their families or go on vacations, Cochran said.

It required a particular learning curve for him around the December holidays: In Rochester, New York, where he served as a church music director, the holiday performances were the highlight of the choristers' year, ""but here half my choir goes north to visit family from Thanksgiving until New Year. You have to go with that.""

Still, the chorus has proven capable of what Cochran calls ""mountaintop experiences."" Several other choruses joined it for the dramatic Carl Orff cantata ""Carmina Burana"" and for its first performance of Beethoven's Ninth in 2014 with guest conductor Christian Macelaru.

There have been more somber performances, too. The chorus learned the Mozart Requiem for a 10th-year observance of the 9-11 tragedy.

""I think that was a really emotional,"" Byrd recalled. ""Everybody was telling stories backstage of where they were during 9-11.""

Some of their hardest works to learn might surprise people.

""A couple of those pops shows had eight-part choruses,"" Gerlach said, recalling an MGM musicals concert in which songs that are simple to the ear, such as ""The Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe"" and ""The Trolley Song"" had sophisticated harmony threads.

""And at the end of every piece there would always be some ridiculously high note,"" said Byrd, who is also soprano section leader. ""It was always my solo — one that I didn't necessarily want.""

""And then we'd rehearse it eight times,"" Cochran added, teasing her.

They still have another year of that work, and they plan to savor it. And even after Cochran relinquishes his choral baton, he plans to continue with the Naples Philharmonic in his position as organist and harpsichordist.

""I was going to go for 30 years with the chorus,"" he said. ""I'd like to go for 50 years with the orchestra!""

988,Pensacola ferries kick off their 2019 season with first rides Friday,"David and Mary Manor waited with about a dozen other people Friday to catch an opening-day ride on a Gulf Islands National Seashore ferry.

Despite the windy and overcast weather, the Pensacola couple was excited to explore the new downtown terminal and the two, 150-passenger boats.

""We like ferries and boats in general and we thought it would be fun to come and do the round trip,"" David Manor said.

The ferry system, named Pensacola Bay Cruises and operated by Hornblower Maritime Services, started its spring operations Friday.

Joe Asebedo, general manager of Hornblower Maritime, said the first day of operations had some glitches — the boat was about 40 minutes behind schedule, the WiFi hot spot needed to operate the on board concessions wasn't functioning and the weather was less than ideal.

But Asebedo said he and others at Hornblower were working to ensure things would be running smoothly by the peak of the summer tourism season.

""We are working on a lot of things and there are more things that will be announced as that happens,"" Asebedo said as he welcomed passengers.

New prices, schedule: Pensacola Bay Ferry operator announces new details for 2019 season

What went wrong last year: Gulf Islands National Seashore superintendent Q&A

Asebedo's company accepted a 10-year contract with the National Park Service in March to operate the ferries.

The two boats were purchased with $4 million in restitution funds from the 2010 BP oil spill and a $1.2 million federal grant.

The ferry service, which runs from downtown to Pensacola Beach and Fort Pickens, started in the summer of 2018. But the original ferry operator, Gulf Coast Maritime Service Inc., declined to sign a contract for another year after, saying it lost more than $300,000 in the less than six moths due to low ridership and high operation costs.

The park service was delayed in finding a replacement operator because of the government shutdown.

Jack and Bobbie Campbell of Pensacola rode the ferries last year and were among the first people in line to ride them again this year. The Campbells said they want the ferry system to be a long-term part of the city and wanted to show their support for the new operator.

""I think they are going to be successful this year. Where else can you ride on a boat like that for that kind of money?"" Jack Campbell asked as he departed the ferry at the downtown terminal.

Robin and Ron Cook of Pace brought their grandchildren, ages 9 and 7, downtown to ride the boat.

Ron Cook said he heard people complain about the ticket prices for the ferries last year, but didn't think the cost was unreasonable for a family outing.

""When you think about it, most everything you do you are going to pay about that much,"" he said.

His wife agreed. And, she said, the ferries are something else fun to do when people come to visit.

""It something different that I think people like us might do a couple of times of year,"" she said.

Melissa Nelson Gabriel can be reached at mnelsongab@pnj.com or 850-426-1431.

989,Pensacola ferries kicked off their 2019 season with first rides on Friday,"David and Mary Manor waited with about a dozen other people Friday to catch an opening-day ride on a Gulf Islands National Seashore ferry.

Despite the windy and overcast weather, the Pensacola couple was excited to explore the new downtown terminal and the two, 150-passenger boats.

""We like ferries and boats in general and we thought it would be fun to come and do the round trip,"" David Manor said.

The ferry system, named Pensacola Bay Cruises and operated by Hornblower Maritime Services, started its spring operations Friday.

Joe Asebedo, general manager of Hornblower Maritime, said the first day of operations had some glitches — the boat was about 40 minutes behind schedule, the WiFi hot spot needed to operate the on board concessions wasn't functioning and the weather was less than ideal.

But Asebedo said he and others at Hornblower were working to ensure things would be running smoothly by the peak of the summer tourism season.

""We are working on a lot of things and there are more things that will be announced as that happens,"" Asebedo said as he welcomed passengers.

What went wrong last year: Q&A on Pensacola ferries

Asebedo's company accepted a 10-year contract with the National Park Service in March to operate the ferries.

The two boats were purchased with $4 million in restitution funds from the 2010 BP oil spill and a $1.2 million federal grant.

The ferry service, which runs from downtown to Pensacola Beach and Fort Pickens, started in the summer of 2018. But the original ferry operator, Gulf Coast Maritime Service Inc., declined to sign a contract for another year after saying it lost more than $300,000 in the less than six moths due to low ridership and high operation costs.

The park service was delayed in finding a replacement operator because of the government shutdown.

Jack and Bobbie Campbell of Pensacola rode the ferries last year and were among the first people in line to ride them again this year. The Campbells said they want the ferry system to be a long-term part of the city and wanted to show their support for the new operator.

""I think they area going to be successful this year,"" Jack Campbell said. ""Where else can you ride on a boat like that for that kind of money,"" he asked as he departed the ferry at the downtown terminal.

Robin and Ron Cook of Pace brought their grandchildren, ages 9 and 7, downtown to ride the boat.

Ron Cook said he heard people complain about the ticket prices for the ferries last year, but didn't think the cost was unreasonable for a family outing.

""When you think about it, most everything you do you are going to pay about that much,"" he said.

His wife agreed.

And, she said, the ferries are something else fun to do when people come to visit.

""It something different that I think people like us might do a couple of times of year,"" she said.

What you need to know about the ferries:

Ticket prices — $18 for adults, $15 for active and retired military, $15 for seniors, $10 for people with disabilities, $10 children ages 3 to 17.

Group discounts — Groups of 15 or more receive a 15 percent discount.

Where to purchase tickets — in person at the ferry terminal, 750 Commendencia St., at the Quietwater Beach ticket kiosk on Pensacola Beach or the Fort Pickens terminal at Gulf Islands National Seashore. Also online at www.cruisePB.com.

Food and drinks —wine, beer, food and other beverages are available for purchase on the boats. Outside alcohol is not allowed.

Charters — The boats are available for charter. For more information, email customerservice@cruisepb.com.

The trip — each leg takes approximately 45 minutes. Riders only need to purchase one ticket and can get on and off the three different locations or stay on the ferry and ride all day.

991,Strong storms rolling into the Tallahassee area,"Severe storms possible overnight across the region. (Photo: National Weather Service Tallahassee)

7:25 a.m. update

Severe storms capable of producing damaging winds and isolated tornadoes are moving into the Tallahassee area this morning.

A severe thunderstorm warning was issued for northeastern Jackson County, where wind gusts of 60 mph were reported around 7:15 a.m. Eastern time 12 miles southwest of Cottonwood. The storm was capable of damaging roofs, siding and trees.

Much of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend are under a tornado watch until 9 a.m. Eastern. The watch, which means conditions are favorable for tornadoes, includes Leon and surrounding counties.

Morning update

A storm system potentially more potent than the one that hit last weekend are forecast to sweep across the region overnight and into Friday morning, bringing chances of wind gusts as high as 80 mph and isolated tornadoes.

The National Weather Service said the storms were expected to move into an area including Marianna and Apalachicola between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. Eastern time and the Tallahassee area between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m.

“The highest threat would be damaging wind gusts,” said Lauren Nash, meteorologist with the Weather Service in Tallahassee. “There’s a chance we could get 70 to 80 mph wind gusts. A few tornadoes are also possible within this line.”

MORE: Rolling storm damage reports - A storm damage reports database shows tornadoes, large hails and high winds in the U.S. during the last 24 hours.

The same storm system produced strong thunderstorms and tornadoes on Thursday across Mississippi and Louisiana, prompting numerous schools to close. Leon County Schools will be closed because of the Good Friday holiday.

Last weekend, a powerful storm system that spun off more than a dozen tornadoes ripped across the country from Texas to New England, killing at least nine people. An EF-1 tornado touched down south of Moultrie, Georgia, on Sunday, damaging several homes.

The severe weather setup for Thursday night and Friday was similar to last weekend’s.

“But we are expecting more widespread impacts with this line,” Nash said. “It’s a stronger system.”

Nash urged people to keep their weather radios, mobile apps and alerts on in case severe weather hits in the middle of the night. She added the area is more vulnerable because of the lingering effects of Hurricane Michael.

“For us, one of the concerns is the overnight aspect and making sure people can get the warnings and get to a safe place,” she said. “But also with some of the damage from Michael, there’s some weakened trees and compromised housing. People just need to be aware of the hazards and risks tonight.”

The storms could bring a couple of inches of rain to the area, though flooding wasn't expected. Cooler weather is expected to settle in behind the cold front, with weekend lows in the upper 40s to around 50 and highs from the upper 60s to mid-70s.

CLEARWATER, Fla. (WFLA) - Residents living in the Southern Comfort mobile home park must vacate the property by October 31.

""The six months without no where to go, we can't save money cause we to pay the rent,"" said Nimie Cotto.

The park is closing, but residents just found out this week.

Cotto just paid thousands to fix her roof.

""There was no clue. There was nothing. These past couple of months everyone's been putting money into their houses. This has been the last three months where you're seeing all the progress,"" she said.

Tracy Johnson has lived there for five years.

She's on a fixed income and can't afford to go anywhere else.

""The cheapest four bedroom I can find is south St. Pete or Holiday, for $1500 a month,"" said Johnson.

The notice states the mobile home lot rentals are being changed to some other use.

According to the county, the park's wastewater package plant has been failing for some time and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection took them to court.

A judge made the ruling to close the park.

8 On Your Side tried getting answers from staff at the office, but were put in touch with corporate instead.

Cotto said it's not fair.

995,Pickle lovers rejoice: Pickle chips are on their way,"Not all people would consider themselves pickle connoisseurs, but those who can't get enough of the sour and tangy snack are in for a real treat.

Vlasic, the company that produces the classic pickle, is introducing a new pickle chip snack that sounds incredibly delicious. Before you start thinking that these are just chips that are pickle flavored, think again. These are actually chips made solely out of pickles.

Pickle snacks have been a growing trend in the past couple years. It seems that every restaurant that serves bar food has fried pickle chips or spears on the menu, so it's no surprise that actual pickle chips will soon be available.

The new pickle chips are also ""vacuum-fried,"" according to Food Business News, so that means they're not fried like a lot of chips are -- making them a perfect low-calorie snack.

A spokesperson for Conagra Brands said the item is ""still in development"" and they don't have an official release date, so in the meantime, we'll keep our fingers crossed that it's sooner than later.

A new fast-casual restaurant in Pensacola promises to plate some of the juiciest, most tender chicken you've ever had, thanks to their unique approach in the kitchen.

Eduardo and Maria Arraez, owners of the family-run Mr. Pollo Pensacola on 6404 N. Ninth Ave., prepare freshly marinated, slow roasted chicken cooked in a rotisserie-style charcoal oven right behind the front counter.

""This is something new for the town, you don't see anything else around here or in the Panhandle at all,"" said Eduardo Arraez. ""It's fast food but it's homemade food at the same time. When you come here you don't have to wait 20, 25 minutes for a meal.""

The Venezuelan-born couple opened their new restaurant on April 8. Mr. Pollo Pensacola replaces the SteakAway on North Ninth but brings a similar quick, carryout-based service ingrained in customers in that area near a busy intersection off of Creighton Road.

What's else is new in Pensacola

Food truck expansion: Nomadic Eats food truck expanding to include downtown Pensacola dining room, event hall

Scooters: Blue Duck Scooters transit system arrives in Pensacola for trial run

Convenience store: Old City Market opens downtown — serving everything from soda fountain drinks to produce

Eduardo and Maria Arraez moved to Pensacola in their late teens before attending the University of West Florida and bouncing around the country a bit. Now they're back in a city they say is their second home, and they brought with them a Latin-inspired menu and style of cooking they think will take off in Pensacola.

""In here, the marination is like a broth,"" Maria Arraez said. ""It's liquid, not a powder, so that's why our chicken is not dry. All the condiments we use are natural, all our dressings are homemade. Sauces, everything is homemade.""

The Arraez couple considers Mr. Pollo to be a healthy alternative to other carryout-based, quick-service restaurants. Sides include sweet, fried plantains, perfect for dipping in their homemade garlic-based sauce, and yucca, a root vegetable native to central South America.

""I tell people it's similar to a potato, but it has more flavor to it,"" Eduardo Arraez said of the yucca. ""A potato, if you don't fry it or put salt on it, you don't get any flavor. The yucca is different.""

Mr. Pollo serves all natural guava, tamarind and horchata juice drinks, with new flavors still to come, like passion fruit and soursop. For dessert, there's homemade tres leches, flan and brownies.

The restaurant is also licensed to sell beer. On top of standard domestic and imported options, soon, Mr. Pollo Pensacola will serve imported beers from the owners' native South America.

""We're looking to introduce a couple different ones from Peru,"" Eduardo Arraez said. ""We'll probably get those in a couple weeks.""

The dining area at Mr. Pollo Pensacola seats around 30. It is open seven days a week, from 11 a.m. until 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday.

1007,Column: 5 affordable and environmentally friendly gadgets to help reduce waste in the kitchen,"CLOSE Throwing away bad food is not just costing you money and wasting the food itself but is wasting the water and energy it took to produce the food and bring it to market. Here are a few ways you can help reduce food waste for Earth Day and year-round. Heather Rayhorn

Editor's note: This column was originally published in the April issue SWFL Parent & Child magazine.

Making the switch toward a more environmentally friendly lifestyle takes time and patience. It takes breaking bad habits and having a new mindset.

Loving the unloved: Naples woman fights beauty standards for fruits, vegetables

In all areas of our life, there are many methods to reduce waste. It could be as simple as finally recycling that pile of old magazines in the corner, or as complex as starting a compost pile in the backyard.

Here are five reusable household gizmos that not only help reduce waste, but also save money and time. Prices for these items range from less than $10 to close to $50. But when you think about the long-lasting effects of making the switch, the value far outweighs the cost.

These helpful alternatives will us get one step closer to a greener planet.

Sustainable food wraps

I’ve reached a point in my green journey where just about any single-use plastic drives me up the wall. That includes Ziploc bags. I used to be a heavy user. Packing carrots in my lunch? Ziploc. Need to store half an onion I didn’t use? Ziploc.

As an alternative, I may use leftover containers (glass is always preferable to plastic Tupperware, of course).

But when space is an issue (in the fridge or in the lunchbox), purchase a pack of sustainable food wraps. I like the ones from a company called Bees Wrap, which are made from beeswax, organic cotton, organic jojoba oil and tree resin. The wraps will seal and conform to the shape of whatever food you’re wrapping. Plus, they come in fun, colorful prints and a variety of sizes (buy the variety pack for $45 and get them all).

When you’re finished, simply wash the wrap with cool water and a mild dish soap and let it air dry for the next use.

Mesh produce bags

I assume by now you’ve already ditched plastic sacks and have committed to bringing reusable canvas bags to the grocery store, right? Good. Take it a step further and use reusable produce bags to cut out those single-use sacks that shoppers often use to package fruits, vegetables and herbs.

In many cases, you don’t even need them. Things like lemons and limes, onions and potatoes — food that we don’t bother to eat the skins of — can just jostle around inside your cart and on the checkout belt.

But for those produce that we do eat the skins of (apples, cucumbers and bell peppers, for example), I’ve started using mesh produce bags I bought on Amazon.com. The brand is called Earthwise, and they come in a couple different sizes. Nine of them cost $14. These are lightweight and see-through, so scanning them at check-out is no problem.

Silicone baking mats

I used to be a big fan of using aluminum foil or parchment paper on my baking sheets to make clean-up easy. But then I started to realize how much of it just got thrown away in the garbage, and how many rolls of the stuff I was constantly buying at the grocery store.

So then I turned to food-grade silicone baking mats.

Silpat is the leading brand, which you can find at most major distributors, including at Bed Bath & Beyond, Sur La Table and Macy’s (and good ‘ol Amazon.com). These mats can be used in the oven, microwave and freezer, and the non-stick coating allows your food (savory or baked goods) to bake evenly and slip right off without the use of oils, butters or sprays.

Then, use a soft sponge to wash your silicone mat to prevent damage.

Stainless-steel straws

There has been a big push recently to cut back on the use of single-use plastic straws. Many diners have decided to simply opt out, kindly asking restaurants and coffee shops to skip on the straw that comes with their drink.

But if you’re like me and having a hard time giving a straw up, invest in a set of reusable ones. I like the stainless-steel straws because they stay ice cold and are thin and long enough to fit in most any lid of a reusable cup (even Yetis!). I try to keep one or two in my purse and in my car for when I’m at a restaurant or pulling through a drive-thru.

This set of eight straws also comes with two flexible wire brushes get a thorough clean.

Reusable K-Cups

Even our morning coffee ritual can be greener. You love your Keurig coffee maker, but you probably don’t realize how much plastic you’re tossing in the landfill when you use single-use K-Cups. A reusable version made of BPA-free and eco-friendly stainless-steel allows you to brew your own ground coffee. Simply fill the basket with your own grounds, and after each use wash it in soapy water or load it in the dishwasher.

The K-Cup replacements from iPartsPlusMore are available on Amazon.com for $10 for a four pack. These are compatible with all Keurig versions, and you don’t even need to replace the filter holder.

1008,Hundreds of Forest High School students recall dark day with brightness,"On the anniversary of the shooting at Forest High School, more than 200 students met privately at the church to celebrate their strength in coming together in the face of the. Then they rolled up their sleeves and dispersed across the city to give back in appreciation for the comfort and support they received.

A year ago, hundreds of Forest High School students took refuge in First Baptist Church of Ocala, shaken after a gunman invaded their school and wounded one of their own.

On Saturday, many of those same students came together again at the same spot, but this time determined not to let that dark day define this or any future April 20.

More than 200 students met privately at the church to celebrate their strength in coming together in the face of those events. Then they rolled up their sleeves and dispersed across the city to give back in appreciation for the comfort and support they received.

""Today is a day to not only have remembrance but to look forward. Every day we keep on moving forward,"" said Chloe Blessing, a sophomore at Forest.

Just weeks after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that took the lives of 17 people in South Florida, a shotgun blast rang out at Forest. An ex-student walked into the school and fired a shot through a classroom door, hitting a student in the ankle. Gratefully, the gunman gave up.

But panic raced through the city. Students loaded buses and evacuated to First Baptist. Parents desperate to know of their child rushed to the church as well.

""The day that it happened so many people were here for us. They were here to stand with us. We were given so much. We needed to give the same love back,"" Chloe said.

Amy Blessing was one of those parents frantic to know of her child a year ago.

""Coming back to this church brings back some emotions. But I did have tears of joy just watching the kids today,"" she said. ""I am very proud and in awe of the administration and the kids for giving back to the community.""

Students spread out across more than a dozen sites Saturday including several charitable organizations and other areas that needed sprucing up.

At Hillcrest School, students tackled the barn behind the school. Hit hard with shovels, rakes, brooms and plenty of elbow grease, the outbuilding got a much-needed freshening. While some attacked the cobwebs, others cleared out dead leaves and debris from the stalls. A couple of students washed out buckets while others vacuumed the office and cleaned out the refrigerator.

Riley Eckenroth, a freshman, cut back the creeping grass from the sidewalk leading to the barn.

""We're giving back communitywide,"" he said. ""It helps to just be able to do something that's helpful.""",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190420/hundreds-of-forest-high-school-students-recall-dark-day-with-brightness?rssfeed=true,2019-04-20T18:52:45Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471

1013,UWF football finds 'No. 1 guy' at quarterback after spring practice,"CLOSE Spring practice wrapped up for UWF on Thursday with a scrimmage. Clarity has emerged at the quarterback position. Eric J. Wallace, ejwallace@gannett.com

“JC really established himself as the No. 1 guy coming out of spring,” head coach Pete Shinnick said. “For the rest, they’re going to have to work to get to that place once we get to fall camp.”

Story Highlights JC Robles emerged at quarterback for UWF this spring

Robles transferred t UWF this offseason from Colorado State

Competition will continue into the fall with the introduction of freshmen

The University of West Florida found clarity in its hunt for a new starting quarterback this spring.

Colorado State transfer JC Robles will enter the summer atop the Argos’ quarterback depth chart, according to head coach Pete Shinnick, thanks to his performance this spring.

Robles finished 14-of-29 for 134 yards with an interception in the Argos’ final spring scrimmage on Thursday evening, which was trimmed due to the impending threat of severe weather.

The 6-foot-5, 215-pound quarterback has been in this position before, earning the top spot in the spring for Colorado State in 2018, according to the Coloradoan, before not seeing any game action in the fall.

Robles said he’s not taking the position at his new school for granted, however.

“It is a relief because there were some times there at my old school where a couple of those springs I was running with the No. 1s and so it was a little tough in the fall (not to start),” Robles said. “But I just have to control what I can control and keep working it into the summer and fall and hopefully I can hold onto it.”

Robles and UWF connected late in the recruiting process this winter after quarterback became a position of need for the Argos with the surprise transfer of Mike Beaudry – who led UWF to an NCAA Division II National Championship Game in 2017 – to Division I Connecticut.

Peyton Calhoun was the only other active UWF quarterback in Thursday’s spring game as Missouri transfer Evan Johnson and UWF veteran Grey Jackson sat out with injuries.

There will be more competition to come at the quarterback position, including the addition of freshman Corey Wilsher, who led North Marion to a Class 5A state final appearance last season. For now, however, Robles has set himself apart according to Shinnick.

“JC really established himself as the No. 1 guy coming out of spring,” Shinnick said. “For the rest, they’re going to have to work to get to that place once we get to fall camp.”

With Argo veterans like Tate Lehtio, Kevin Grant, Quentin Randolph and Ka’Ron Ashley among Robles’ potential targets this fall, the transfer quarterback said it’ll be important to continue to build chemistry in Shinnick’s offensive system this offseason.

“From top to bottom, I feel like all the guys I’ve been running with have the ability to get separation and make big catches,” Robles said. “We just have to keep working and getting better and I think we’re going to get there. I think we’ll make some plays this fall so I’m definitely excited about that room.”

1016,Radio listener calls Sheriff Grady Judd's use of phrase 'insensitive',"A radio listener said comments made by Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd this week were insensitive toward African Americans.

POLK COUNTY, Fla. - A radio listener said comments made by Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd this week were insensitive toward African Americans.

The comments were made Wednesday morning in a radio broadcast on WPCV-FM, 97.5, in Lakeland.

During an interview, Judd told the story of a black teenager who was recently arrested by deputies.

""He goes up onto a porch and steals a bicycle,"" Judd was heard telling the hosts. ""Keep your cotton picking, sticky hands off people’s property.""

""Cotton-picking sticky hands. It's his words saying it,"" said Tony Corletto.

He said he was in his car taking his daughter to school when they heard Judd on the radio.

""I couldn't believe that a man that is supposed to have his posture, with his level of authority, is saying a racial slur like that on the radio for everyone to hear,"" he said.

News 6 took Corletto's concerns about Judd's use of the phrase to the Polk County Sheriff's Office.

A spokesperson said the sheriff didn't know the suspect was black when he made the remarks:

""The Sheriff is heard by hundreds of thousands of people through TV, the radio, and during public speaking events every week, and he's absolutely certain of one thing - that despite his best efforts to the contrary, someone somewhere may misunderstand what he says.""

That's not enough for Corletto, who said he's turned Judd's comments into a teaching moment for his 6-year-old.

""Admit to what you said, own up, be a man and you say you're sorry,"" he said.

University of Central Florida associate English professor Beth Rapp Young, Ph.D., told News 6 the phrase ""cotton-picking"" has been used many times over the years with no intended racial overtones.

""I checked a couple of research corpora and some standard dictionaries (Merriam-Webster, American Heritage, Oxford English Dictionary), and all of them say that this expression of disapproval originated in the 1950s, though linguists have found earlier instances of it,"" she said. ""None of the dictionaries label this phrase as being racially charged or offensive.""

She said the phrase was used in Bugs Bunny cartoons in the 1950s.

""However, it's easy to see why people find 'cotton-picking' to be offensive, since we all know that slaves picked cotton,"" she said. ""A similar term, 'cotton picker,' is definitely considered to be a slur.""

1017,Mount Dora police chief accused of making inappropriate remark,"MOUNT DORA, Fla. - Mount Dora Police Chief John O'Grady is under fire after remarks he made at an event Friday.

A statement released by city representative Lisa McDonald read: ""The City Manager was made aware of a certain unacceptable statement made during the Mount Dora Heroes Foundation Golf Tournament on Friday, April 12, 2019. The remarks are in no way reflective of the city’s values, principals and ideals and can only be characterized as insensitive and inappropriate. The city has prepared an apology that is being distributed to all members and sponsors that were in attendance at the Mount Dora Heroes Foundation Golf Tournament.""

During Friday's ceremony, O'Grady is said to have made a racially insensitive remark about Hispanics.

Laura Hargrove is an attorney for a couple who owns Las Palmas restaurant in downtown Mount Dora.

On her social media page, she explains an award was to be presented to them, but a medical emergency kept them from attending.

The chief, she said, decided to allow a Hispanic officer to accept on their behalf.

He reportedly said the officer should accept because they were, ""the same.""

An interview with the chief was declined.

Hargrove said she and her clients have yet to receive the apology letter but expect to in the coming days.

She said her clients will continue to support the community and the city of Mount Dora and encourage others to do so, as well.

""We look forward to receiving the letter and putting this incident behind us,"" Hargrove said.

O'Grady began working for the department in 2013.

He served as the public safety director and was pegged to take on the position as chief once the former chief retired.

His personnel file shows he's held in high regard, with others complimenting his accomplishments.

However, the law enforcement veteran is now on paid administrative leave following last week's comment.

""There was no clue. There was nothing. These past couple of months everyone's been putting money into their houses. This has been the last three months where you're seeing all the progress,"" she said.

Tracy Johnson has lived there for five years.

She's on a fixed income and can't afford to go anywhere else.

""The cheapest four bedroom I can find is south St. Pete or Holiday, for $1500 a month,"" said Johnson.

The notice states the mobile home lot rentals is being changed to some other use.

According to the county, the park's wastewater package plant has been failing for some time and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection took them to court.

A judge made the ruling to close the park.

8 On Your Side tried getting answers from staff at the office, but were put in touch with corporate instead.

Cotto said it's not fair.

""Kids are growing here. We know who's our neighbors and this has broken all our dreams. All we worked for,"" she said.

1019,Shark scare at Cocoa Beach,"- Lifeguards at Shepard Park in Cocoa Beach spotted the fin of a blacktip shark on Wednesday.

The shark was spotted from one of their watch towers and was about 100 yards from the shoreline. That prompted a closure of the beach for swimmers, for approximately 30 minutes.

""It's very scary. I think I'm not putting my feet in the water anymore,"" explained Luna Cohen, who was hosting friends on vacation from Brazil.

She said she had a close encounter with a shark in Titusville a couple of years ago, and she still a little spooked about it.

""I was in the shallow area too, it was by my knees, but the lucky thing was I was able to run out!""

Officials said a blacktip shark is about two to five feet in length and it the type of shark that commonly bites humans -- they swim in very shallow water, sometimes in just a few inches of water.

With a big holiday weekend, swimmers are being asked to stay alert.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/shark-scare-at-cocoa-beach,2019-04-18T21:17:18Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

1027,Chiles' Lawton Campbell turns running injuries into touchdown receptions,"The star middle school runner who won a cross country state championship as a freshman with the Timberwolves has found a new family in flag football

Among a historically prolific Tallahassee running scene, Chiles senior Lawton Campbell was as heralded an up-and-coming runner as has come through the area.

She had five wins her eighth-grade year at Deerlake Middle School, including winning the Leon County Middle School Championship at Apalachee Regional Park in 12:11 on a two-mile course.

Campbell's thrilling ARP win came while leading a field that included five current Chiles runners – among them Emily Culley, who took second place at state at ARP as a junior; Alyson Churchill, who won a state title in 2016 on the same course; and Caitlin Wilkey, who has two top-10 state finishes at ARP.

Campbell, likewise, was going to be a star runner for the Timberwolves – maybe even the star – or so it was rumored.

“I heard a little bit of whispering about where I was going,” Campbell said. “I was zoned for Chiles and I’d always wanted to run for Chiles, so I was excited to run for Chiles High School. It was my goal to run all the way through my senior year and hopefully run as a collegiate athlete.

“That didn’t really work out well.”

In late July 2015, the summer before her freshman cross country season at Chiles, Campbell was doing a simple stride workout at Forest Meadows when she stepped on a root and rolled her ankle. She continued to run, but that night felt something was wrong.

The prognosis was she had broken it. Instead of running in regular-season meets, Campbell spent her fall in a boot, then rehabbed her way back with pool workouts.

She returned just in time for Chiles’ district meet, which allowed her the minimum needed to run in the upcoming state championships. The Timberwolves won a state title, and Campbell finished as their seventh runner.

“I was thrilled to run,” Campbell said. “I definitely didn’t run what I anticipated I’d run my freshman year, but it was nice to be on a state-winning team.”

Based on her time, Campbell wound up as second-team All-Big Bend runner.

During her spring track season, she ran five two-mile races (personal record 11:08), four one-mile races (PR 5:13), a couple 800-meter runs (PR 2:22), and she was a part of Chiles’ fourth-place 4x800 relay team at state. She was named second-team All-Big Bend.

All seemed good. But it wasn’t.

Campbell was overcompensating for the initial ankle injury, which affected her hips and growth plates that weren’t yet fused as she grew. That resulted in her spine getting out of alignment. Further rest and rehabilitation rehab was needed.

“I hit the wall,” Campbell said. “My dad, who was a professional athlete in tennis, and I always talked about peaking and we were always real cautious. We never went crazy, never wanted to peak in middle school.

“Unfortunately, it kind of seems like my career as a runner peaked in middle school. But it was just a series of bad luck. It was one injury resulting in the next and the next. It snowballed.”

Fighting sophomore year during cross-country season just to see if she could have a track season, a trip to Tallahassee Orthopedic Clinic resulted in words she never thought she’d hear.

She shouldn’t run.

“They didn’t see a good future,” Campbell said. “They said it would keep escalating. It was frustrating. It was a loss for me. That was my identity, as a runner. It was almost like I was mourning a death.”

Campbell hung around her teammates through track season. But she was just the girl helping out with meet tasks. There was no running. The camaraderie she had long enjoyed on side-by-side runs was gone.

“It was a life-changing adjustment,” Campbell said. “Ever since then it has been about how do I overcome and respond to adversity.”

Then one day Campbell’s mom got an email from another track mom about a flag football interest meeting at Chiles.

“My mom said, ‘Lawton, you need to be active. You’re missing out, and I know you’re a competitor,’” Campbell recalled. “My dad really encouraged me, but I didn’t want to do it. They didn’t force me to do anything, but they really encouraged me to do it. I went in there with an open mind.”

She played some fall ball her junior year and enjoyed it. That turned into powder puff, then her first flag football season last spring. Though, just for good measure, she got injured during the season.

“I have no luck,” Campbell said. “It’s not my go-to sport, but I’m having a great time, honestly.

“It’s a completely different atmosphere and environment. There’s running, which is a great way to do what I love the most, but it’s really cool picking up something new.”

As a junior, Campbell had experienced skill position players around her to carry the load.

This year, she is the experience and has proven her worth as a captain and at receiver. Campbell has 30 catches for 260 yards and five touchdowns as the Timberwolves have gone 8-4 heading into Monday night’s district semifinal game against Lincoln.

“I don’t play any defense. I’m not a flag-puller. I don’t really like the contact. I just like to run, turn over my shoulder, and see if the ball is there.”

In a Senior Night win this past Thursday against Pace, Campbell was a deep threat, catching two long passes in the first half. The latter was a short out-route that she turned into a 40-yard sprint down the sideline to beat a defender to the pylon for a last-second touchdown.

The wheels are still there.

“Never in a million years would I have said this is where I would be when I entered freshman year,” Campbell said. “I would have told you I’d be breaking five minutes in the mile or setting records or going to state or going to run in college somewhere awesome. The thing I have learned the most is when handed adversity, it’s the champions that respond properly that come out on top.

“I’ve really tried to focus my efforts on getting better and not focusing on the setbacks. Flag football has been a great opportunity. I love it.”

Don’t sleep on the Timberwolves

While Class 1A No. 2 Godby (11-1) and No. 8 Florida High (10-1) will meet Monday night in a volatile district semifinal as the 7:30 game at Gene Cox Stadium, the earlier 6 p.m. game features two unranked teams.

Lincoln (5-7) has been as high as No. 7 this season while starting 4-1. But the Trojans lost six in a row during the regular season to fall from the rankings. Lincoln's season-ending upset over Florida High helped clinch a top sub-district seed.

Chiles, despite going 8-4, has not yet cracked the rankings despite securing back-to-back victories over ranked Lincoln, 20-7, and ranked Madison County, 25-13.

That could change if the Timberwolves can pull off another so-called upset of the reigning district champs.

“We’ve been off the radar and people haven’t paid attention to us until we beat Lincoln and Madison,” Chiles senior quarterback Rachel Myrick said. “Finally, we started hearing our name again. That just makes me want to win even more, win all of it. I know Lincoln will come in strong, but if we play the way we have been and play our game, I think we can pull it out.”

Myrick, who is left-handed, and sophomore Sam Wilson, who is right-handed, have been in full sharing mode at quarterback and receiver since Wilson came up from JV at the end of last season.

While Chiles made the district semifinals last year, the Timberwolves were also very predictable offensively. They lost 26-0 to Godby.

This year, the backfield combo has worked smoothly, though Myrick has been used primarily at receiver and in catching passes out of the backfield in two-quarterback sets. She has 30 catches for 400 yards and six touchdowns.

“Having two quarterbacks that throw with each hand has allowed us to throw a lot of double passes,” Myrick said. “Sam coming up last year was a change for me. I’d always played quarterback and had never played receiver. This year, I feel like I’ve played a good role at receiver. I understand now from playing both positions how one can help the other.”

Said Chiles coach Stan Goldstein: “I don’t think we’re very predictable. We have two people capable of running the offense, whether that’s run or pass.”

Wilson, who has passed for over 1,400 yards with 17 touchdowns has reliable targets in Myrick, senior Lawton Campbell, and juniors Molly Hennessy (33 catches, 480 yards, 7 TD) and Talia Miller (48 catches, 300 yards).

While the production has been good, the wins have been even better. And Chiles has done it despite returning just four varsity players.

“I’m very proud of them,” Myrick said. “We do have a lot of new girls that have never done this before. I feel like we’ve come so far as a team from the beginning of the season. They came in, learned what they needed to do, and they’re very good at their certain roles.”",http://rssfeeds.tallahassee.com/~/601037802/0/tallahassee/home~Chilesapos-Lawton-Campbell-turns-running-injuries-into-touchdown-receptions/,2019-04-20T22:39:28Z,Tallahassee Democrat,Couple,"277 N Magnolia Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA",FL,32301
1029,'My parents took my whole life from me': Turpin kids make emotional statements in torture case,"Advertisement 'My parents took my whole life from me': Turpin kids make emotional statements in torture case Share Shares Copy Link Copy

A Southern California couple who pleaded guilty to locking up and abusing 12 of their 13 children for years, as well as some of the victims, made their first public comments Friday during an emotion-charged hearing where the parents were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.Louise Turpin wept and said she hoped to hug her children again one day. Her husband, David Turpin, was overcome with emotion as he tried to read his statement just after the two eldest of the couple’s 13 children, also in tears, described the impact of the abuse.The children, ranging from 3 to 30, have not been publicly identified. Here are excerpts from their statements and from the judge:___Jane Doe 4, age 30:“My parents took my whole life from me but now I’m taking my life back. I’m in college now and living independently.“I believe everything happens for a reason. Life may have been bad but it made me strong. I fought to become the person I am. I saw my dad change my mom. They almost changed me but I realized what was happening. I immediately did what I could to not become like them.“I’m a fighter, I’m strong and I’m shooting through life like a rocket.”___John Doe 2, age 27:“Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that have happened, such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten. But that is the past and this is now. I love my parents and have forgiven them for a lot of the things that they did to us.“Since January I have learned so much and become very independent. In June of last year I learned how to ride a bike and ever since then I’ve been hooked and ride it everywhere, such as to school, the store, or sometimes I just go on long rides because I enjoy it so much.“I’m getting a bachelor’s degree in software engineering and after I get my bachelor’s degree. I’m going to get a job as a software engineer and go to school part-time to get my master’s degree. I also have learned how to advocate for myself, how to swim, how to eat healthy and prepare a balanced meal. I have also been learning how to manage money wisely.”___John Doe 2, reading a statement from another sister:“I love both of my parents so much. Although it may not have been the best way of raising us, I am glad that they did because it made me the person I am today. I just want to thank them for teaching me about God and faith. I hope that they never lose their faith. God looks at the heart and I know he sees theirs. I pray often for them.”___Attorney Janet Latourette, reading a statement on behalf of another daughter:“I want the court to know that our parents loved each other and loved each of their children. People ... said our parents were having too many children. Our parents didn’t agree. They felt that God blessed them with all their children so they kept away from the world and trusted God would guide them through life.“Through the years things became more and more overwhelming but they kept trusting in God. I remember our mother sitting in her recliner and crying saying she don’t know what to do. She didn’t want to use rope or chain, but she was afraid her children were taking in too much sugar and caffeine. The reason our parents didn’t stop buying the soda was because father needed it for work. He would fall asleep driving and got in an accident. They didn’t know what else to do.“I believe our parents feared if they asked for help, they would lose their children.“I feel like 25 years is too long. I believe with all my heart our parents tried their best to raise all 13 of us and they wanted to give us a good life. They believed everything they did was to protect us.“If at all possible, I would appreciate if the court would place our parents as close to the detention center they are in right now so if we ever want to visit them, we can.”___David Turpin’s attorney, Allison Lowe, read from his statement:“I thank God for all of my children. Each one of them is a blessing from God. My homeschooling and discipline had good intentions. I never intended for any harm to come to my children. I’m sorry if I’ve done anything to cause them harm.“I love my children and I believe my children love me. I hope and pray that my children can stay close to each other and look out for each other since their mother and father cannot be there for them and with them.”David Turpin then took over reading, saying he wants his children to be successful in school.“I am so proud of each and every one of my children. I miss all of my children and I will be praying for them. I long for the opportunity to have contact with them again.”___Louise Turpin:“I’m sorry for everything I’ve done to hurt my children. I love my children so much. I’m blessed to be the mother of each one of them. I really want the best for them. Their happiness is very important to me.“They are very smart, amazing individuals. I hope they get all the education they need to make their dreams come true. They deserve only the best in life. I don’t want any of them to be sad or depressed because of all of this.“I want them to know that Mom and Dad are going to be OK. ... I really look forward to the day I can see them, hug them and tell them I’m sorry.”___Judge Bernard Schwartz:The lives of the children “have been permanently altered in their ability to learn, grow and thrive. You have delayed their mental, physical and emotional health. To the extent that they do thrive ... it’ll be not because of you both but in spite of you both.“The only reason that your punishment is less than the maximum time in my opinion is because you accepted responsibility at an early stage in the proceedings to spare your children from having to relive the humiliation and the harm they endured in that house of horrors.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/my-parents-took-my-whole-life-from-me-turpin-kids-make-emotional-statements-in-torture-case/27213335,2019-04-20T11:08:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
1030,Clay: 'There’s not much they can do for us right now',"FORT WALTON BEACH — On a mid-February afternoon in a patch of woods next to a school, robins hop around empty vodka bottles and food containers, scattered clothes and pillows, and several car batteries on the mucky ground.

A lamp leans against a tree. Shirts and pants hang on clotheslines attached to palms near a toppled shopping cart. Laughter and shrieks of delight from children at play float through the woods from the nearby school. No one is inside a large tarp-covered tent in the woods or at other, adjacent makeshift camps.

Not far away, Clay and Wanda Wittman sit on a curb, their few bagged belongings by their side. While they don’t stay in the woods by the school, they look weather-beaten and seem deeply tired.

The Wittmans met each other while working in the area for a government contractor.

“When the contract was terminated, we (lost our jobs and) wound up on the street,” said Clay, who’s 61.

He and Wanda have been homeless for about a year.

“I’ve got a vehicle, but it got impounded,” said Wanda, who is 57.

On this particular afternoon, the temperature was in the low 60s.

“We sleep over there,” Clay said while pointing to a church's covered walkway.

He said the church allows homeless people to sleep on the walkway at 9 p.m. each night.

There are some other couples and some single people who stay there, too, Clay said. He said he and his wife sleep there even on very cold nights, when the temperature drops to the 40s and 30s.

The Wittmans have talked with Homelessness and Housing Alliance officials about permanent housing, but “there’s not much they can do for us right now,” Clay said.

He’s on kidney dialysis and has a pinched nerve in his back that makes it painfully difficult to walk. Besides his physical suffering, Clay said one of the toughest parts of being homeless is dealing with poor weather, especially rain. He praised the church for helping him and his wife.

“They pay attention to the weather,” Clay said.

After a little while, the couple is visited by 26-year-old Ken Wilkerson, who is a relatively new resident of Fort Walton Beach. He gives them some food he received from the pantry managed by the nonprofit Catholic Charities of Northwest Florida.

“You’ve been too long in this world to live on the street,” Ken tells the Wittmans. “Once you get to this point, it’s hard to get up” and change.",https://www.thedestinlog.com/news/20190420/clay-theres-not-much-they-can-do-for-us-right-now?rssfeed=true,2019-04-20T10:31:11Z,The Destin Log,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
1031,Tornado hits Camden County; high winds leave mark on SE Georgia,"<p>A line of severe thunderstorms and a tornado barreled across Southeast Georgia on Friday, leaving a trail of damage. The front facade of a furniture store in Kingsland was ripped off by high winds, a tractor-trailer was blown over on the causeway to St. Simons Island and strong winds rolled a Ware County mobile home off its foundation and ripped it apart.</p>

<p>A National Weather Service damage survey confirmed an EF0 tornado touched down about noon near Georgia Highway 40 West in Camden County, snapping several pine trees as it moved west-southwest toward Georgia Highway 110. According to the NWS, the tornado was 10 yards wide, had peak wind of 80 mph and traveled nearly half a mile.</p>

<p>About 16 miles east in Camden County, authorities said straight-line winds were responsible for blowing out the front wall off the Badcock Home Furniture store in Kingsland. The front of the building collapsed onto two trucks parked out front.</p>

<p>""One of the vehicles happened to be mine, but, yeah, two vehicles lost in the storm,"" store manager Sterling Cobb said. ""I feel like I'm thankful for being alive.""</p>

<p>Cobb said the storefront was ripped away in almost slow motion.</p>

<p>""All of a sudden, we heard, like, a wind, a heavy wind, and I looked forward and the building was falling down. It was actually peeling like an orange,"" Cobb said. ""It was frightening."" </p>

<p></p>

<p>There were five people inside the store when it happened. Cobb told News4Jax they were all toward the back of the store and it was a miracle that no one was injured. </p>

<p>A viewer who sent a photo of the damage reported seeing a funnel coming from the clouds.</p>

<p>""This was after what looked to be a tornado hovered over the store and receded back into the sky,"" Rhonda Askin wrote.</p>

 SLIDESHOW: <a href=""https://www.news4jax.com/weather/photos-strong-storms-sweep-through-southeast-georgia-northeast-florida""><strong>Photos of storms passing, damage left behind</strong></a></p>

<p>Though the front of the store was badly damaged, News4Jax was told that most of the furniture that was inside was untouched.</p>

<p>Crews spent a couple of hours cleaning up the debris and boarding up the front of the building. Security will be in place Friday night to make sure nothing is stolen from the store.</p>

<p>""It's a mess,"" Cobb said.</p>

<p>Though it will take weeks for the business to be fully restored, the store manager said there will be a small kiosk outside where customers can go to. Cobb expects the building to be back to normal in about six weeks.</p>

 Ware County mobile home destroyed 

<p>Buck Thigpen​​​​, his wife and 4-year-old son were inside their home near Waycross when strong winds rolled the house and split it apart.</p>

<p>""We just felt everything around us shaking and moving. The house rolled and there we went,"" Thigpen said. ""When we got out, there were no walls around. We landed only by the grace of God.""</p>

<p>Thigpen had a broken collarbone and a scratch on his face. Though it will take weeks for the family to clean up, they are grateful they will be starting over with each other.</p>

<p>""You look at all this stuff back here. This is nothing when your family is safe  ... and a broken collar bone, a few scrapes is all you get. This stuff is replaceable,"" Thigpen said. </p>

<p>In Glynn County, the driver of the semi that was blown over by a gust of wind on the F.J. Torras Causeway was taken to an urgent care facility, the county's public information officer said. The crash completely blocked both lanes into St. Simons Island for a few hours, leaving hundreds of drivers sitting in traffic.</p>

<p>""It's only one way on and off the island, so it's going to be a while,"" traveler Richard Ryman said. </p>

<p>Due to slowed traffic on the causeway, Glynn County Public Schools delayed dismissal for schools going to and from St. Simons Island because buses couldn't get through.</p>

<p>As of 4 p.m., according to the Glynn County Emergency Management Agency, crews were working on the causeway. All lanes of the causeway were back open about 45 minutes later. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Glynn County public information officer said a line of strong storms that passed through also downed trees and power lines. Drivers were asked to stay off the roads, if possible, as many traffic signals throughout the area were out. If a traffic signal is not working, drivers should treat an intersection as a four-way stop. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.news4jax.com/weather/weather-authority-alert-day-for-tomorrow_"">Charlton and Ware counties preemptively closed their schools</a> Friday. </p>

<p>Across the state, the storm system knocked down trees, caused minor flooding and cut off power to thousands of residents.</p>

<p>Georgia power companies reported that more than 37,000 customers were without power around the state Friday afternoon.</p>

1033,Priceless advice: Three methods on how to assess your home's value,"Realtor Joe Manausa (Photo: TRENT SMITH)

You are probably aware that that the Tallahassee housing market is doing well right now, but do you know how much your house is worth in today’s market? When asked, customers often answer this question with something like “Well, the Zestimate of my home is…”.

The number they list is sometimes close to the correct value of their home, but other times it’s way off. In fact, when the CEO of Zillow sold his home a while back, he sold it for 40% less than what Zillow said the home was worth. Maybe he’s just a generous man …

Zillow’s Zestimate, as well as other online home valuation tools, are merely tools that look at price per square foot valuations of homes nearby. They often fail to take into consideration floor plans, swimming pools, frontage (living on a lake, acreage, or a golf course versus a home on an interior lot). Don’t make the mistake of hitting the market without an expert valuation from a local Realtor who takes everything into account.

When you value homes, there are three methods that you should use to determine a property’s value. Whether or not you plan to sell your home any time soon, knowing the value of your home is often the starting point for making wise financial decisions.

1. The Cost Approach

The cost approach works by analyzing what it would cost to build the property in today’s market, adding the current value of the parcel of land on which it sits and then subtracting a factor for obsolescence or depreciation. This method is rarely impactful as resale homes are heavily influenced by supply and demand. If there are too many homes for sale, cost will have no bearing on valuations, as sellers will have to compete to get them sold. Fortunately, the opposite is true as well. If there are too few homes on the market, buyers very well might have to pay a premium to have a seller part with her property.

2. The Income Approach

The income approach is typically used with investment properties. The net income a property generates (net operating income) is used to derive a market value based on a multiple of the property’s annual income. Generally speaking, the more income a property generates, the more it is worth.

3. The Sales Comparison Approach

The sales comparison approach, also known as the market approach, works by looking at the supply and demand for similar homes. We look at similar homes that are for sale, the selling prices of similar properties that have recently changed hands, and how many similar homes that have failed to sell recently.

The prices of each of these homes are adjusted upwards or downwards based upon how they compare with the subject property (the home that we’re evaluating). Then, by averaging the prices of the comparable properties, an appropriate value is determined for the subject property.

The Best Method

To find the real value of your home, you should use all three approaches, but heavily weigh the findings from the sales comparison approach.

To evaluate current market factors, there are a couple of questions you should find the answers to. Is the population in your region growing, or is it shrinking (long-term)? Also, are the costs involved in making new homes going up, or are they going down?

Remember, all markets are subject to supply and demand, and if more supply is needed, then the cost of creating additional supply will affect the values of the supply that is already in the market, over the long run.

Following the methods above will help you determine an accurate value for your home. Then, with an understanding of current market factors, you can develop a well-informed strategy regarding when to sell and buy a home.

If you need help coming up with a plan or determining your home’s value, find an experienced real estate agent with an in-depth knowledge of market trends and home values to make the process easier.

1034,"Perkins, Cicchetti help Maclay tennis pull off rare district sweep","The Marauders won all 14 finals matches across both the boys and girls District 1-1A tournaments

When he graduates from in May, Maclay senior Will Daughton’s plans are to head off somewhere like Syracuse, Northwestern or SMU to pursue a career in sportscasting.

Always the lead in school plays growing up, Daughton’s voice has been used to call athletic events for the Marauders.

“I grew up a fan of sports,” Daughton said. “And I fell in love with the idea of going to games, giving your perspective, and sharing the excitement you feel in your living room to others.”

A standout tennis player in his own right, Daughton won at No. 2 singles and No. 1 doubles for Maclay during this week’s District 2-1A tournament at Maclay as the Marauders continued an impressive streak. Maclay’s boys haven’t lost a district tournament in nearly 20 years.

Additionally, the Marauders created a rare sweep this week, sending all seven positions through to finals on the boys’ and girls’ sides and winning all of their finals matches.

Maclay’s boys won its district title by beating Community Christian, and the girls topped St. John Paul II. Daughton lent his perspective on the achievement.

“It shows the good coaching Maclay has had over the span (of 20 years),” Daughton said. “We’ve always had a good core. We may graduate a couple seniors and have a couple down years, but we’re never down and out. Even when we have a young team with inexperience, the coaching helps and we’re still able to win districts and get to regionals.

“The success this year of having everyone in the finals is testament to the hard work we’ve put in. Tough matches, good wins, bad losses, it all comes together in the postseason. We’re peaking at a really good time.”

Daughton’s doubles partner, sophomore Nick Cicchetti, won at No. 1 singles in a challenging match against Florida High’s Gabe Roane. It was a tighter match than the 6-2, 6-0 score indicated.

CITY TOURNAMENT: Chiles' Wilson, DeCardenas win city titles, but boys team crown still up for grabs

“He really challenged me,” said Cicchetti, who was runner-up in this year’s city tournament. “In the first set, he made some shots that I wasn’t expecting to come back over the net and he played really good. He had his first serve going a little bit, and he was moving the ball around really well, got some good depth on the ball. He played really well.”

For Community Christian’s boys team, it finished as district runner-up for the first time since regional appearances in 2013 and 2014. Those years, the Crusaders had middle-schoolers Josh Macri and Matt Wilson leading them. Macri went on to become a two-time All-Big Bend Player of the Year at Chiles, and Wilson was a part of the same dominating Timberwolves team.

After graduating its top player from last year, Stephen Prutsman, CCS didn’t incur some of the troubles of past years in seeing middle-schoolers head off to public high schools.

TENNIS PREVIEW: Landscape among boys and girls as even as it has ever been

As a result, Crusaders head coach Jacob Breman filled a lineup with one senior at No. 3 singles and four freshmen. Four singles reached the district finals as well as No. 2 doubles.

“We’re young and talented and we have time to keep growing,” Breman said. “They’ve done really well. I’m really proud of them. They rose up and did what they needed to do (Tuesday). We fully expected to get to the finals.

“They competed really well. I’m excited for their potential the next few years.”

Another with budding potential is Maclay sophomore Madison Perkins, who won a district title at No. 1 singles after entering having suffered consecutive losses to Leon’s Jules Grady, city champ Gracie Wilson of Chiles, and Niceville’s No. 1 player.

But Perkins, who had a slow start to her season while transitioning back into court shape once the Marauders’ soccer season ended, came out firing against St. John Paul II senior Sara Grace Rooney. Perkins won 6-2, 6-2 against Rooney, who the day before ended NFC junior Laura Ceci’s two-year reign as district champ with a tie-breaking semifinal victory.

“I think I’ve grown a lot from last year,” Perkins said. “I’ve been hitting with better people more often and I’ve been training really hard at EJT. Sara Grace is an amazing player. She crushed me last year. I’m just really happy that I’ve been able to grow and compete and beat her this year, because it took a lot. I’ve played a lot of tennis recently and made it my main focus.”

St. John Paul II, which entered Wednesday tied with Maclay after advancing all seven of its positions to finals as well, will make its fourth-straight regional appearance. The Panthers have lost the past three years in the first round to Pensacola Catholic.

Perkins hopes her Maclay team can come through this year in regionals as well. Catholic has cut down the Marauders the past two years in the second round. Last year, Perkins advanced to state in No. 1 doubles.

“One of my main things I need to work on is confidence on the court because I get really nervous and tight against players that I think should beat me,” Perkins said. “I need to overcome that because I think my tennis skills have really improved since last year. I can compete with them, I just need to get past the mental block.

“I think I’ll have some confidence heading to regionals, and I hope we can get our team to state this year.”

10 a.m. update

Severe storms that moved through the area this morning are exiting Leon County.

A tornado warning for northern Leon County is no longer in effect. A radar-indicated tornado was seen earlier this morning in the Bradfordville area.

A tornado watch remains in effect for Dixie, Jefferson, Lafayette, Madison and Taylor Counties until 11 a.m.

9:15 a.m. update

Northern Leon County, including Bradfordville, is under a tornado warning until 9:45 a.m. The warning includes Thomasville, Georgia, and nearby parts of South Georgia.

The National Weather Service in Tallahassee reported a radar-indicated tornado was located at 9:10 a.m. about 10 miles north of Tallahassee. It was moving northeast at 70 mph. The storm is capable of producing penny-sized hail.

9:05 a.m. update

A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for central Leon County, eastern Gadsden County and north-central Wakulla County until 9:30 a.m.

The storms are capable of producing damaging winds over 60 mph, hail and heavy downpours, according to the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.

The line of storms was located along a line extending from near Bainbridge to northwest of Crawfordville and moving northeast at 70 mph.

The Weather Service reported a radar-confirmed tornado touched down earlier this morning southeast of Blountstown.

A tornado watch is in effect until 11 a.m. for Dixie, Franklin, Gadsden, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Taylor and Wakulla counties.

8:28 a.m. update

A tornado warning has been issued for parts of Gulf, Wakulla, Gadsden, Liberty, Leon and Franklin counties.

A severe thunderstorm with radar-indicated rotation was located 11 miles north of Eastpoint and moving northeast at 80 mph, according to the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.

The storm was expected to remain over mostly rural areas of southeastern Gulf, northwestern Wakulla, southwestern Gadsden, southeastern Liberty, southwestern Leon and northwestern Franklin County, the Weather Service said.

7:25 a.m. update

Severe storms capable of producing damaging winds and isolated tornadoes are moving into the Tallahassee area this morning.

A severe thunderstorm warning was issued for northeastern Jackson County, where wind gusts of 60 mph were reported around 7:15 a.m. Eastern time 12 miles southwest of Cottonwood. The storm was capable of damaging roofs, siding and trees.

Much of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend are under a tornado watch until 9 a.m. Eastern. The watch, which means conditions are favorable for tornadoes, includes Leon and surrounding counties.

Morning update

A storm system potentially more potent than the one that hit last weekend are forecast to sweep across the region overnight and into Friday morning, bringing chances of wind gusts as high as 80 mph and isolated tornadoes.

Severe storms possible overnight across the region. (Photo: National Weather Service Tallahassee)

The National Weather Service said the storms were expected to move into an area including Marianna and Apalachicola between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. Eastern time and the Tallahassee area between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m.

“The highest threat would be damaging wind gusts,” said Lauren Nash, meteorologist with the Weather Service in Tallahassee. “There’s a chance we could get 70 to 80 mph wind gusts. A few tornadoes are also possible within this line.”

The same storm system produced strong thunderstorms and tornadoes on Thursday across Mississippi and Louisiana, prompting numerous schools to close. Leon County Schools will be closed because of the Good Friday holiday.

Last weekend, a powerful storm system that spun off more than a dozen tornadoes ripped across the country from Texas to New England, killing at least nine people. An EF-1 tornado touched down south of Moultrie, Georgia, on Sunday, damaging several homes.

The severe weather setup for Thursday night and Friday was similar to last weekend’s.

“But we are expecting more widespread impacts with this line,” Nash said. “It’s a stronger system.”

Nash urged people to keep their weather radios, mobile apps and alerts on in case severe weather hits in the middle of the night. She added the area is more vulnerable because of the lingering effects of Hurricane Michael.

“For us, one of the concerns is the overnight aspect and making sure people can get the warnings and get to a safe place,” she said. “But also with some of the damage from Michael, there’s some weakened trees and compromised housing. People just need to be aware of the hazards and risks tonight.”

The storms could bring a couple of inches of rain to the area, though flooding wasn't expected. Cooler weather is expected to settle in behind the cold front, with weekend lows in the upper 40s to around 50 and highs from the upper 60s to mid-70s.

1036,"Pensacola FemFest is back: Self Love Sunday, Womanhood in Lavender headline schedule","FemFest returns to Pensacola next week to celebrate intersectional feminism with an extended weekend of events.

The third annual FemFest runs from Thursday, April 25, through Sunday, April 28.

FemFest founder and organizer Kirstin Norris said the work done by the collective of feminist organizations in Pensacola to advance equality and educate the community can be serious, taxing work for those involved. So FemFest is about taking a deep breath and celebrating with those who have furthered the movement, while also raising funds to help organizations that are doing the same.

""We spend a lot of time doing things like the women's march and involving ourselves in these causes but it can take a toll on us emotionally, it's a lot of work, it's a lot of commitment,"" Norris said. ""And FemFest is there to serve as an opportunity to celebrate. To take a lighthearted, fun week to celebrate the things we believe in and to celebrate each other.""

What are the FemFest events in 2019?

1037,Flora-Bama Mullet Toss traces its roots to cow chips,"It’s likely there will be two kinds of mullets at the annual Interstate Mullet Toss on the Florida-Alabama line this year, as the past has seen.

However, only the fish will be tossed from state to state – that is unless you can hurl your friend Bobby rocking the ‘80s hairdo into the Yellowhammer State. Though it’s probably for the best not to try.

Instead, party-goers at what Flora-Bama declares is the world’s best beach party, can have their go at throwing a mullet – known around here as good eatin’.

Jenifer Parnell, marketing and PR director for Flora-Bama, said that over 30,000 people come for the weekend and more than 2,000 participate in the Mullet Toss.

“It's a celebration of life and all different kinds of people coming together to have fun on the white sandy beaches and toss fish for charity,” Parnell said. “People hang out for three days enjoying the sunshine, listening to live music and tossing mullet from Florida towards Alabama.”

The event raises more than $20,000 for local charities, focusing on gifts to youth organizations.

Folks of all ages are welcome to compete. Categories are broken up into age brackets from 0-1 year old, all the way to 90 and older in both male and female categories.

This will be the 34th installment of the Mullet Toss at Flora-Bama, an event that got its start when two guys were inspired by another peculiar flinging contest.

“One of our owners, Joe Gilchrist, was out west with Jimmy Louis, a musician and songwriter, and they saw a ‘cow chip’ throwing contest,” told Parnell. “When they came home to the area, Joe wanted to do something that would gain some business for the bar in the shoulder season.”

Parnell said that Gilchrist thought about the contest and wondered what he could do here that would be similar but more focused on our area, and he came up with a mullet.

“The mullet is indigenous to our area, so he went to the fish market, bought a few, called some friends, brought some coolers to the beach behind Flora-Bama and started a mullet-throwing contest,” she said.

Parnell said the weekend is wonderful for people-watching and many great moments have happened at the Mullet Toss.

“I love the kids toss and seeing them start their Flora-Bama memories – the mullet are half their size,” she said. “There was another time when an older woman wanted to come throw a fish to mark it off her bucket list and 90th birthday. She came down and threw that mullet. Then she returned each year until she passed away. After that, her family came to throw in her honor.”

CLOSE Participants at the 2013 annual Flora-Bama Interstate Mullet Toss have many methods of flinging fish across the Florida and Alabama state line. online@pnj.com

Cameron Price, co-owner and general manager of Flora-Bama, said the Mullet Toss is the place to be at the end of April.

“It has all the ingredients: sunshine, bikinis, sand, Bushwackers, salt water, ice cold beer, and lots of good looking guys and gals from all over the southeastern United States,” Price said.

Price remembers a year that his team ordered too much milk to make sure the bar didn't run out of Bushwackers. The mistake saw an unofficial record made by a late-comer.

“Since we had so much leftover milk after the toss, we decided to have a locals mullet toss the next weekend,” Price said. “A guy showed up who was a college javelin thrower. He probably threw the mullet around 10 times. All of his throws were around 200 feet, with his best coming in at 215 or 220 feet. This would have been a mullet toss record, but it wasn't during the official toss. What he was able to do with that mullet was really impressive.”

Parnell reminds spectators that Flora-Bama provides free beach chairs around the toss and there are plenty of food and drinks on the beach as well as inside the bar. However, if you would like to bring your own beach chair you are welcome to do so.

Participants should bring their throwing arm ready for action. Hand sanitizer, towels to clean off with, and of course, the fish will be provided.

Part of the festivities include the Mr. Mullet Hot Body Contest and Miss Mullet Bikini Contest happening Friday and Saturday. Parnell said the participants always have a good time competing in the contest, which awards the top three with each cash prizes.

1038,NDN LETTERS 0419,"U.S. uses too much plastic

China has been enabling the plastic addiction of the United States (as indicated in a recent Naples Daily News business article). We are long past wake-up time concerning this nation’s habit of single-use plastic.

AG barr says ""riggit"" (Photo: wexler)

It is inexpensive in the short term but promises to be very expensive in long-term ramifications. We depend on the ocean, which this product damages, for food and oxygen.

Due to lax regulation and corporate ambition, the captive consumer can no longer purchase any food item without being stuck with this destructive and unnecessary product. It comes as the tiny plastic labels on apples and pears, plastic boxes for berries, plastic netting for bags of citrus and even Christmas trees, to plastic-lined paper bags of animal food.

The marriage of plastic to paper, as in those bags of animal food, down to the business envelopes with plastic windows, renders the paper non-recyclable too. I hope more companies will follow those leaders who simply have the tiny envelope window open.

Finding new buyers for our waste is not an answer. Government and industry need to get on board to halt proliferation of plastic and our addiction to it.

University Village near FGCU

I am writing to acknowledge and support the Naples Daily News for reporting March 27 that five more restaurants are coming to University Village near FGCU. I am ecstatic to see that the Naples Daily News is connecting to the Florida Gulf Coast University community. As a student here at FGCU, it is amazing to see our community get involved and share these local specialties with the Naples community.



With the University Village just being completed this past year, many residents are not aware of the new community and what the shopping center has to offer. The University Village shopping center now has a F-45 fitness center, Yoga Lab, Mellow Mushroom, a nail salon and many more options for residents to explore.

The FGCU community is more than overjoyed to hear that #getfried, Slicer’s Hoagies, KC American Bistro, CaliBurger, and Marlin’s Brewhouse will be opening soon at University Village.



Here at FGCU, we love that the Lee County community is involved, and we hope to see more support for the university overall in the next couple years. Thank you for the support!

Trump creates jobs, for attorneys

I am a gun-owning tree-hugger who has practiced law for 40-plus years. Thanks, Mr. President, for your expansive jobs program for litigation attorneys.

How does this jobs program work? It involves the president's ignorance of ""the law"" and his violations thereof.

The president should have a basic working acquaintance with the law.

Not the guy currently in office. This president rules by tweets. The Senate is cowed by him, the House is the proverbial ""canary in the coal mine,"" and the Supreme Court is ruled by Mitch McConnell. Yep, adversarial politics are involved.

Which brings me to litigation attorneys. This administration has issued such a plethora of questionable rules, regulations, policy changes, executive orders, etc., causing litigators to step up to protect and enforce the ""law,"" not to pay homage to the king.

The U.S. courts have generally stayed above political frays (Mitch McConnell notwithstanding) and remain the conscience of our legal system. This is where you will find litigators.

Time to applaud and recruit more litigators. Help wanted: ethical individuals of character, intelligence and open-mindedness; decent pay, benefits, miserable hours, immediate gratification if victorious and deep remorse if not; not for the faint of heart.

Democrats moving too leftward?

The anti -Semitism in the Democratic Party is deplorable. If President Trump made the horrible comments that Ms Omar did, the House Democrats would be screaming like banshees, screaming for impeachment for his un-American comments. Yet, Ms. Omar has gone unpunished and remains on the foreign affairs committee.



Even Pelosi, whom I don't like, tried doing the right thing by proposing a resolution condemning anti-Semitism. House Dems stopped her. It's pathetic that Pelosi has to propose such a resolution.



All Americans should be very afraid of what is happening to the Democratic Party. The real Democratic Party is being taken over by the extreme left, socialist/communist, progressive, un-American people.



I have no problem with real Democrats (moderate), but they need to speak up. I have a huge problem with the Obama-style alt-left, socialist progressives. They are destroying the Democratic Party and this country. They are destroying our freedoms that we fought so hard for in the American Revolution and many other wars that cost American lives. They must be put to a stop or the American way of life will be lost forever, the end of the United States of America.



Make America great again. Keep America great forever.

A prayer for this time

During this season, my mind turns to ""The Southwell Litany,"" an old favorite of my late husband, Samuel Southard, a seminal leader in the pastoral theology and pastoral counseling movements.



It’s a weighty missive and given the state of this world, its words can bring the transformation we so desperately need, one person at a time. Even if you have chosen not to believe there is a God, the Litany’s content speaks to everyone willing to examine themselves honestly. Here is an excerpt:



“Save us and help us, we humbly beseech Thee, O Lord. … From pride and self-will; from desire to have our own way in all things; from overweening love of our own ideas and blindness to the values of others; from resentment against opposition and contempt for the claims of others; enlarge the generosity of our hearts and enlighten the fairness of our judgments; and from all selfish arbitrariness of temper. …”



“In all times of ignorance and perplexity as to what is right and best to do, do Thou, O Lord, direct us with wisdom to judge aright, order our ways and overrule our circumstances as Thou canst in Thy good Providence; and in our mistakes and misunderstandings.”

Donna Southard, East Naples

1039,Cash on heavy hitting ahead of series finale against Baltimore Orioles,"The Tampa Bay Rays, with 14 wins and 4 losses, have the best record in the league. The team is putting on a show on the mound and at the plate. They have the third highest team batting average at .269 only trailing the Houston Astros by .002 and the Los Angeles Dodgers by .008.

Brandon Lowe went two for four at the plate yesterday against the Orioles with a home run and a double.

“He can hit,” says the Rays manager, Kevin Cash, ahead of the final game of the series on Thursday, “and he can generate the power pretty uniquely for a guy his size but he seems to have a lot of good at bats, picked us up in big ways, obviously, with the home runs but he has picked up a couple of hits and some doubles the other way which has been nice on some challenging pitches.”

Mike Zunino went three for four at the plate yesterday with two doubles.

“Z has had a track record of hitting the ball really hard,” Cash tells us, “and I know he got off to a slow start but it looks like he has simplified some stuff. I know that him and Chad have worked really hard working on fine-tuning and getting his timing at the plate. Yesterday, he missed two fastballs that I think he wanted to hit and be able to handle, didn’t get off on it and then he smokes the ball into the gap for the second double of the night but it is nice to have his bat going because, you know, he can change the game with one swing.”

The Rays hope to sweep the series against the Baltimore Orioles with another win tonight.",https://www.wfla.com/sports/cash-on-heavy-hitting-ahead-of-series-finale-against-baltimore-orioles/1937086518,2019-04-18T21:51:50Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1040,Shark survey scientist finds two sawfish in eight days,"CLOSE Stephen Kajiura, professor of Florida Atlantic University's Elasmobranch Laboratory in Boca Raton, saw two sawfish in 10 days' time offshore of MacArthur State Park in Palm Beach County. ED KILLER/TCPALM, Wochit

What's cooler than seeing your first sawfish in the wild? How about seeing your second one just eight days later?

That's what happened recently to Florida Atlantic University biology professor Stephen Kajiura.

Each spring for the past nine years, Kajiura has conducted weekly aerial surveys of blacktip sharks by flying along the coastline of Palm Beach County at 500 feet of altitude. In all those surveys, Kajiura had photographed more than a million blacktip sharks, countless hammerhead sharks, tiger sharks, manta rays and many other forms of marine wildlife.

Sawfish, rarely encountered by anglers, spearfishermen and researchers, are on the increase in South Florida waters. This one, estimated at 14 feet in length, was caught and released in 2016 by Capt. Ben Chancey near St. Lucie Inlet in Stuart, Fla. (CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY BEN CHANCEY OF CHEW ON THIS CHARTERS) (Photo: BEN CHANCEY/CONTRIBUTED PHOTO)

But it took until earlier this month before he witnessed his first sawfish.

""I have video, but you can’t see the sawfish — it is just a blur,"" said Kajiura, who heads up FAU's Elasmobranch Laboratory. ""It was a very cool sighting, right up close to the beach, no more than 30 meters off the beach.""

Kajiura normally brings along a camera for still photos, but did not have it with him the day of the first sawfish sighting. Little did he know, he would get his second chance a few days later.

More: Celebrate National Sawfish Day on Wednesday

The first sawfish was near Boca Raton and was seen swimming southbound in shallow water. He estimated it to be about 9 feet long. The second one was near MacArthur State Park on Singer Island and a little larger. Sawfish can grow as large as 17 feet in length.

Comeback kids?

Kajiura's sawfish encounters are the latest in a regular string of encounters reported by anglers, divers and researchers. In recent years, sawfish have been caught and released by Florida anglers fishing from beaches for sharks, or in inlets for tarpon. Sawfish have become regular catches for anglers fishing the waters of the Indian River Lagoon, Everglades National Park or the waters of Charlotte Harbor.

Divers have been seeing more of them in recent years around reefs and wrecks off southeast Florida near the Treasure Coast and Palm Beaches. Spearfishermen and women will see them lying still on the sandy ocean floor. One spearfisherman, John Dickinson of Jupiter, filmed 10 sawfish in two separate groups on one day in February of 2017. After he uploaded the video to YouTube, sawfish researchers claimed they had never before recorded an encounter of more than two sawfish in one place at the same time.

Scientists working with sawfish have only begun to unlock mysteries about their mating behavior and locations, and where the unique marine animals give live birth to their young. The waters of Florida Bay and the Bahamas are two places where sawfish births have been witnessed. A sawfish mother may produce 7-14 pups about two feet in length. According to scientists working with the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, sawfish reach sexual maturity at about 7 years of age when they are about 11-12 feet in length.

And, push. The Florida State University Coastal and Marine Laboratory research team assisted an adult female sawfish in a live birth of five pups in December 2016 near Andros, Bahamas. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY DEAN GRUBBS)

The problem with sawfish, said Adam Brame, sawfish recovery coordinator for NOAA Fisheries, is there aren't very many of them left.

""The good news is, though, we are hearing of more and more encounters by anglers, divers and boaters throughout South Florida,"" Brame said. And the reports are coming in from farther afield.

Brame said two sawfish sightings early in 2018 came from a Georgia Department of Natural Resources team working on a sea turtle project.

""We also heard of a few juvenile sawfish in the Florida Panhandle a couple of years ago,"" he said. ""There is good strong evidence suggesting the population of sawfish in the wild is stabilizing, and it suggests potential recovery.""

Brame said scientific evidence of recovery is still being evaluated.

Unkind history

More than a century ago, sawfish inhabited coastal waters from Texas to North Carolina. However, they only inhabit Florida's waters now. Researchers determined original sawfish numbers have declined by an estimated 95 percent since the early 1900s. In 2003, sawfish received the dubious honor of becoming the first marine fish listed as an endangered species.

An estimated 7-10 foot long sawfish was captured on video just offshore of Bathtub Beach in Stuart by Port St. Lucie diver Fred Meyer in February 2018. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY FRED MEYER)

The sawfish and many other marine organisms are suffering from habitat loss and a depletion in water quality in the estuaries in which it lives. Although many forms of fishing gear were deadly for sawfish incidentally entangled, the passage of Florida's Net Ban Amendment in 1994 helped by removing some of it. However, sawfish still die by becoming entangled in fishing gear, crab and lobster trap lines, and mooring lines. Brame said some sawfish have had their critically important rostra, or saw, cut off, which is illegal to do.

""We believe these sawfish which have had their rostra removed will eventually die as they will not be able to hunt for themselves,"" he said.

Kajiura's first sawfish was swimming lazily, seemingly without a care in the world. And while it had no idea it was being watched, it was something Kajiura will never forget.

See a sawfish?

Respect, release, report

It is illegal to harm, harass, target or harvest sawfish in the United States.

Sawfish are protected by the Endangered Species Act after being listed in 2003.

Anglers should release sawfish immediately; Never lift them from the water or drag them onto shore; Do not use ropes or gaffs to secure the fish; Cut line as close to the hook as possible.

Divers should keep one's distance; Avoid disturbing sawfish; Never touch, chase or feed them.

Report all sightings and encounters to 1-844-4SAWFISH or www.sawfishrecovery.org.

1041,"More cases of hepatitis A expected in Martin County, according to health report","Buy Photo A press conference regarding the recent hepatitis A outbreak in Martin County was held at the Martin County Sheriff's Office on Friday, April 12, 2019, in Stuart. (Photo: HOBIE HILER/SPECIAL TO TCPALM)

MARTIN COUNTY — More cases of hepatitis A are expected to arise in Martin County because of a statewide outbreak.

There have been ""multiple introductions of hepatitis A virus into Martin County,"" according to a report from the Martin County Department of Health.

More than half of the 19 people infected with hepatitis A in Martin County are men, with 42% of them over the age of 60.

Martin County Commissioner Edward Ciampi posted this and other information on the local hepatitis A outbreak on Facebook, citing the Martin County Department of Health.

The report noted eight people infected with the virus are older than 60. Eight others are between the ages of 30 and 49. The other three are between 20 and 29.

Renay Rouse, the state health department's Martin County spokeswoman, said the report was sent to health officials in the county and state, as well as local agencies, but was not intended to be released to the public.

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious disease that attacks the liver. The majority of the people who get the virus have flu-like symptoms — such as nausea, vomiting and fevers — but recover within a week or two. It's unusual for the virus to cause death.

More: Martin County Department of Health extending hours Thursday for hepatitis A vaccines

As of Thursday morning, the number of confirmed cases in Martin County, 19, and deaths, three in Palm City, had not changed since April 12.

St. Lucie County has two cases and there are none in Indian River County.

Ten of the 811 reported cases of hepatitis A in Florida since Jan. 1 were fatal.

Five people who were infected in the county used drugs, were homeless or had traveled internationally, the report said.

""For the outbreak in Martin County, no common shared activities, including restaurants, have been identified at this time,"" the report said.

Jeffrey and Nancy Kirsch (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY NED KIRSCH)

Jeffrey Kirsch and his wife, Nancy Kirsch, both 62, were found dead in their Palm City home March 28. Lee Collins, 61, died March 31. The cause of death for all was ""complications of hepatitis A.""

More: Friends remember Jeffrey Kirsch, Stuart attorney found dead with wife in Palm City home

Dr. Roger Mittleman, chief medical examiner on the Treasure Coast, said he's never seen a couple die from hepatitis A around the same time. He said Jeffrey Kirsch also tested positive for hepatitis B, but it's unclear whether hepatitis B adversely affected him.

""It's hard to say if he had any effect from the hepatitis B, many people are carriers. He had a heart bypass operation years ago, and it's conceivable that this (hepatitis B) is the result of a transfusion (from an operation),"" he said.

Hepatitis B is an infection that can cause scarring of the liver and can lead to death if not treated. People can get the infection through sexual contact, sharing needles, transfusions, or it can be passed down to a person when they're born.

More: Hepatitis A deaths: 'It makes no sense to us,' says brother of Stuart attorney Jeffrey Kirsch

Mittleman said looking at Nancy's autopsy, he doesn't believe there was an underlying condition that made the hepatitis A infection so severe.

The couple both showed signs of jaundice and did not have alcohol or drugs in their bodies when they died, according to their autopsy reports.

A total of 140 people have died in the United States since a hepatitis A outbreak started in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - Like many families, Crystal and Rich Colbert play with their four children after school each day. But their family's ""normal"" didn't come easily.

""There are around 500,000, give or take, embryos frozen in the United States,"" said Dr. Sandy Goodman with the Reproductive Medicine Group in Tampa.

Dr. Goodman explains the embryos come from families hoping to start their own families through in vitro fertilization. Around 3,000 children have been born through embryo donation, according to the National Fertility Support Center.

""Sometimes couples will complete their family and there will be more embryos than they would like to transfer. And sometimes they will donate their embryos,"" Dr. Goodman said. ""Some of them remain frozen until a couple decides what they want to do. And others are donated to science.""

Embryo donation is a concept some find controversial.

""I've heard women say IVF is like playing God,"" Crystal said.

1043,"Cubans face new limits to U.S. remittances, tourism","HAVANA, Cuba - Cubans at Western Union stores in Havana reacted to the newly announced limitations the United States is placing on remittances to the island.

National security adviser John Bolton announced Wednesday in Coral Gables that President Donald Trump's administration will be limiting U.S. remittances to $1,000 per person, per quarter, which is about $330 monthly or $4,000 annually.

Odalys Salazar Gomez said she receives a montly allowance from her son, who lives in Hialeah. The limit would definetly hurt her and others who depend on remittances to cover their expenses.

""At least in my opinion, it's criminal,"" Salazar Gomez said about the new policy.

According to the Cuban Consulting Group, Cubans receive about $3.4 billion a year in remittances from the U.S., so the policy change is certain to affect the island's economy. The change comes about a week after Raul Castro, now the leader of Cuba's Communist party, warned of of the deteriorating economy.

There were long lines at supermarkets in Cuba. In the last couple of months, Cubans have been experiencing shortages of chicken, cooking oil, eggs and flour.

Jerry Henderson arrived from the United States on a cruise to Havana on Wednesday. He learned about Bolton's announcement that the U.S. will be restricting non-family travel to Cuba.

""Anything that Obama did, he is trying to stop,"" Henderson said.

1047,Video of face-eating suspect allowed as evidence,"STUART, Fla. - A judge will allow as evidence a video of a former college student struggling against his restraints at a Florida hospital the night he's accused of killing two people.

Austin Harrouff's attorneys say the video shows the ""mental status"" of the 22-year-old hours after he's accused of killing 59-year-old John Stevens III and 53-year-old Michelle Mishcon. Police say the Florida State University student was found biting and chewing on Stevens' face in the couple's driveway.

Harrouff is charged with two counts of first-degree murder.

1048,Florida History: What Oscar-winning celebrity committed suicide in a Florida beach house?,"He was wearing a swim suit and a bath robe. His body was hanging in a closet of a rented beach cottage, a red and white belt cinched around his neck.

When he didn't show up for breakfast at a nearby restaurant, a neighbor went to the house and found him.

John Monk Saunders -- Army aviator, author, Rhodes Scholar, magazine editor, Academy Award-winning writer, and recently divorced husband of actress Fay Wray, of ""King Kong"" fame -- was dead at age 42.

""BEACH WRITER HANGS SELF,"" screamed the banner Page 1 headline in The Fort Myers News-Press on March 12, 1940. It was front-page news across the country, too.

More classic Hollywood: How Veronica Lake's career began and ended in Florida

The small, two-bedroom cottage that Saunders rented in Fort Myers Beach on Florida's southwest coast was about as far as you could get from Hollywood, where his stories of wartime fliers were turned into classic movies such as ""Wings,"" which won the first Oscar for best motion picture.

Saunders had been in a tailspin for a long time. Handsome and talented, he was once dubbed the ""Golden Boy."" But alcohol, drugs and mood swings began to dominate his personality.

And then there was the way he treated his wife.

King Kong desired Wray's character so much that he fought off airplanes on top of the Empire State Building. But in real life, Saunders cheated constantly on his wife, neglecting her and saying she bored him. Toward the end of their marriage, he even kidnapped their two-year-old daughter, and spent all her money.

He didn't leave a suicide note. His life was one long suicide note.

Except to early film fans, Saunders is mostly forgotten, but the sad arc of his life is getting attention again in an excellent new memoir by Wray's daughter. And few know that if it wasn't for Saunders, the man many consider Hollywood's most debonair actor might have a different name.

***

Fay Wray never forgot the first time she saw Saunders at the gates of Paramount's studio.

""It was a warm summer afternoon. He was dressed in white flannels, a dark-blue blazer and wore a white Panama hat. I thought he was astonishingly good-looking.""

Wray's recollection is quoted in her daughter Victoria Riskin's new book, ""Fay Wray and Robert Riskin: A Hollywood Memoir"" (Pantheon). In telling the story of Wray's happier marriage to her father, screenwriter Riskin (""It Happened One Night""), she recounts her childhood surprise at discovering her mother had been wed before.

Saunders and Wray met in 1927. She was 18, a rising star who had never gone on a date. He was ten years older. Wray felt ""a current of sensory feeling"" when Saunders touched her arm. They fell hard for each other, but he was having an affair with the wife of studio chief Jesse Lasky, and he told her he wasn't planning to stop.

She married him, anyway.

In her youthful ""confusion,"" Riskin wrote, she tried to accept a man who drank heavily and blamed his infidelities on being ""oversexed.""

On the surface, they were glamour personified. She became an icon for playing the Beauty to King Kong's Beast. His aviation and underworld tales were turned into movies for legendary directors William Wellman, Josef von Sternberg and Howard Hawks.

Saunders' pinnacle was winning the Oscar for Best Story for Hawks' ""The Dawn Patrol."" But as his drinking magnified, the work dried up, Riskin wrote.

The couple had brief glimpses of happiness, but then Wray would catch him drunk or with other women. Saunders would make anti-Semitic, pro-Hitler comments. At a party, he decked actor Herbert Marshall, who had lost a leg in World War I, which played badly in the gossip columns.

Wray became pregnant and they had a daughter, Susan, but it didn't help their relationship.

""John's decline accelerated,"" Riskin wrote. ""His pupils were often enlarged, his eyes vacant, his movements bizarrely slowed.""

When she woke up to find him injecting a drug into her, Wray finally asked for a divorce. He retaliated by selling their house and taking all her money.

As she worked to replenish her bank accounts, he kidnapped their daughter for a couple of months and eventually landed in Charlottesville, Va., where he checked into a hospital for ""a nervous condition"" and had their daughter put in the pediatric unit.

Custody laws favored fathers in Virginia at the time, Riskin wrote, but Wray managed to take Susan back to California and get a divorce. Saunders went for more treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, but finally headed south with a nurse, winding up in Fort Myers.

""For a long time, John had been standing precariously at the abyss,"" Riskin wrote. ""Now he had reached the dark and lonely end of his journey.""

***

Saunders was no stranger to Florida. He did his military training here. And it was front page news when he arrived in Fort Myers in February 1940.

""This is Mr. Saunders' second season at the beach,"" the News-Press reported, ""which he says is the best place he has found for a rest, as well as the quietude he needs for his working hours.""

He apparently kept to himself, preferring long walks and time alone in his cottage. It was the 1940s version of celebrity rehab. But his nurse departed three days before he was found dead on March 11, and he probably shouldn't have been left alone.

After his suicide, rumors about a dissolute lifestyle quickly spread, and the paper followed up with another front page story on March 13: ""Beach Friends Deny 'Wild Tales' About John M. Saunders.""

Local restaurant owners got to know him, including Mrs. Watt Harris, who ran the tea room where he was supposed to show up for breakfast.

""Mr. Saunders was a lovable character,"" Mrs. Harris (no first name given in those days) told the News-Press. ""He was sensitive and nervous and not in good health and insisted on working long hours. Sometimes he drank too much and then hated himself for doing so.""

Harris said Wray called her soon after his death. According to national news accounts at the time, the actress was ""heartbroken,"" and had ""collapsed.""

""He often told me how proud he was of the fine life and happy times he had lived with Miss Wray,"" Harris told the Fort Myers paper. ""I don't know why he wanted to take his life except he was not happy and his work did not make his life complete.

""The only reason I'm saying all this about Mr. Saunders is that some people had spread wild tales,"" she added. ""He may have had too much to drink for his own good but he was always a gentleman.""

Why did he kill himself? Some trace Saunders' problems to the fact that he spent World War I in Florida -- as a flight instructor instead of in heroic combat. A columnist friend claimed that punching actor Marshall had exiled him from Hollywood, and he couldn't bear it. Today, his mood swings and drinking might be diagnosed as a bipolar disorder.

***

Saunders' abbreviated career remains, at best, a footnote in Hollywood history. In the 1920s and early 1930s, though, his name was big enough that it was a selling point in advertisements for his films.

Perhaps his true claim to fame is a gift he unknowingly gave to a young actor.

In 1931, Saunders wrote his only novel, ""Single Lady,"" a Lost Generation tale of a French girl and her soldier pals that critics felt was patterned too closely on Hemingway's writing. It was turned into a Broadway musical called ""Nikki."" Despite Wray as the star, it did about as well as the book, closing after 39 performances.

Her leading man in the show was a former acrobat and vaudeville comic with the curious moniker of Archibald Leach. Saunders had named Leach's character Cary Lockwood.

When Leach went to Hollywood, he needed to change his name to something suitable for a movie star. Fond of Wray and his experience acting with her, he chose the name Cary, then added the last name of Grant. You know the rest.

Until she died at age 96 in 2004, Wray never spoke unkindly about Saunders. When writing her autobiography, she fretted to a New York Times reporter that it was ""unfair"" to expose his weaknesses.

""How can anyone make a judgment on what other people do?'' Wray said in that 1989 interview. ''It's just not possible for me. It's so tragic that John had this theme in his life of living dangerously and dying young.''

In an interview last month with the Los Angeles Times about her memoir, Victoria Riskin said Wray ""didn’t talk a lot about (Saunders) except toward the end of her life. I found in some of her personal notes that she felt she had let him down. She knew she was stronger. She knew she was caring and didn’t find that key to open the door to saving him.

""She felt that she should have been able to help him, and she couldn’t. He was beyond help.""

1054,The Villages' Mann is DC boys hoops Player of the Year,"THE VILLAGES — Heading into his senior year, Tre Mann has a decision to make about his future.

A supremely talented basketball player — one of the best in the country — Mann could have chosen to attend practically any school he wanted, including those which would have offered a grander stage on which he could showcase his multi-faceted skills.

For Mann, though, it was a quick — and easy — decision to make.

“I wanted to be different,” said Mann, who chose to remain at The Villages for his final season. “I wanted to show everyone that you don’t have to go to those kind of schools to get attention. You can still be a McDonald’s All-American or a Jordan Brand All-American even if you stay at your original school.

“Besides, I wanted to stay and help my team try and win a state championship.”

Mann came up short in his goal to win a state title — the Buffalo lost to Fort Lauderdale University, the eventual Class 5A champions, in the state semifinals — but he certainly left everything he had on the floor. The 6-foot-4 guard averaged 23.6 points and 4.9 rebounds per game for the Buffalo and scored at least 30 points in a game on 10 occasions.

He also helped transform Buffalo games into standing-room only affairs and alerted countless college coaches to the amount of talent in Lake and Sumter counties.

For his efforts on the basketball court, Mann is the Daily Commercial boys basketball All-Area Player of the Year.

Mann’s selfless attitude — his willingness to put team goals above his personal desires — speaks volumes about his level of maturity. He knows his on-court talents outshine others, but rather than boasting and looking for the nearest spotlight, Mann wants his teammates — like longtime friend Terry Ivery, who suffered a devastating knee injury as a sophomore and fought his way back to earn First Team honors as a senior — get some deserved attention.

“Everyone on this team is my family,” Mann said. “A lot of us have been together for a few years now and some like Terry Ivery — I’ve known him since I was 7 years old — are like my brothers. Terry and I have played on the same team since we met. There would be no me without Terry helping me along the way. He and everyone else on this team has played a role in our success.”

Mann led the Buffalo to a 23-8 record this season. It marked the third-straight season with at least 20 wins and was the second time in three years the Buffalo reached the Class 5A state semifinals.

This year might have been The Villages’ third consecutive trip to the Final Four had Mann not been sidelined with a knee injury during last season’s district playoffs.

After taking some time off following the end of the 2017-18 regular season, Mann was back in action in time for summer basketball, where he proved to college coaches clamoring for his verbal commitment that he was back to his old form. Eventually, after considering many of the nation’s top college basketball powerhouse programs, Mann announced that he would attend the University of Florida.

He made his college choice official in November when he signed a national letter of intent.

“I’m looking forward to the challenge of playing college basketball,” Mann said. “I want to help the program continue to grow and produce winning seasons. I just want to be a solid contributor on what is already a very good team.”

That has always been Mann’s goal.

Contribute to his team’s success.

It’s something that has never gone unrecognized by his coaches.

“Tre has meant the world to our program,” said Buffalo coach Colt McDowell. “Both him and Terry Ivery bought into our vision, had my back, and took ownership and leadership of what our program is all about on a daily basis. For the last four years, I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a kid work harder, serve his teammates more and understand how to put the team first and let his individual accomplishments take care of themselves.

“He’s earned multiple All-American honors (McDonald’s and Jordan Brand), but what I am most proud of is that he has stayed so humble and hungry, and continues to work and be the same person he was as an eighth grader when barely anyone knew who he was. I’ve always called him a blue-collar, blue-chip player, and no one deserves the success he’s had more than Tre.”

Mann’s love for his team and his teammates was never more apparent than when McDowell took him off the floor for the last time late in the Buffalo’s state semifinal game. Despite scoring only 17 points — a poor outing by his standards — and losing to high-powered University by 38 points, Mann wasn’t in tears, nor was he sulking.

Instead, he walked off the floor with his head held high and hugged each of his teammates and coaches.

The loss, while painful, was secondary.

For Mann, the moment was about the satisfaction of helping his teammates achieve a dream.

“My goal was to get to the Final Four and win a state championship, but just to be able to get there for a couple of teammates who had never been there before was satisfying for me,” Mann said. “Some of our guys had never won a district championship before. There was no reason to hang my head when I thought about that.

“I have so many unforgettable memories at The Villages, especially the time I spent with my teammates and coaches — my family.”",https://www.dailycommercial.com/sports/20190421/villages-mann-is-dc-boys-hoops-player-of-year?rssfeed=true,2019-04-21T06:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
1056,The Latest: Trump expresses anger at Mueller report,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" The Latest on special counsel Robert Mueller's report and President Donald Trump (all times local):

3 p.m.

The White House says President Donald Trump played golf Friday with conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh and a couple of unidentified friends.

Trump is spending the Easter weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago club along with the first lady. The foursome played at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.

The trip comes one day after a redacted special counsel report found no Trump campaign collusion with Russia around the 2016 election, but issued no clear verdict on obstruction, while detailing several instances of Trump seeking to squash the investigation.

Prior to golfing, Trump lashed out through tweets at people who cooperated with Robert Mueller's team. He said statements in the report made by some were ""fabricated & totally untrue.""

Trump struck a much harsher tone than the day before when he marked the report's release by tweeting ""game over.""

___

9:25 a.m.

President Donald Trump says some statements made in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report are ""fabricated & totally untrue.""

Tweeting Friday from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump dubbed the more than 400-page document the ""Crazy Mueller Report.""

He's alleging that ""notes"" some people said they took after meetings with him didn't exist until they were created for the Mueller investigation.

Trump says he never agreed to testify because he didn't need to respond to what he says were ""total bullshit"" statements made about him in the report to make someone look good or make him look bad.

__

9:10 a.m.

The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has issued a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller's report and the underlying materials.

Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York is asking for the information by May 1. That's also the day when Attorney General William Barr is scheduled to testify before a Senate committee and one day before Barr is set to appear before Nadler's committee.

The subpoena is the opening shot in what could be a lengthy legal battle.

If the Justice Department doesn't respond, Democrats could hold officials in contempt of Congress or eventually fight the battle in court.

The Judiciary Committee voted 24-17 earlier this month to give Nadler permission to issue subpoenas for the final report, its exhibits and any underlying evidence or materials prepared for Mueller's investigation.

___

8 a.m.

President Donald Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders is pushing back on allegations that special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report exposed a culture of lying at the White House.

Sanders also disputed allegations that she misled the media when she said that ""countless"" members of the FBI had lost confidence in FBI Director James Comey, which led to his firing.

Sanders had told reporters after Comey's 2017 dismissal that she had heard from ""countless"" members of the FBI who welcomed the president's decision.

She told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Friday that her word ""countless"" was a ""slip of the tongue"" made in the ""heat of the moment.""

Democratic House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, also speaking on ABC, said the Mueller report clearly outlines ""a culture of lying"" inside the White House.

__

7:40 a.m.

House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler says he expects to issue a subpoena within a few hours for special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election meddling and President Donald Trump.

The New York Democrat told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" Friday that he is preparing a subpoena not only for Mueller's complete report, but also for the underlying documents, including grand jury evidence.

He said, ""We need the entire report, unredacted, and the underlying documents in order to make informed decisions.""

Attorney General William Barr sent the Mueller report to Congress, with some material redacted, including grand jury information. Grand jury evidence, including witness interviews, is normally off limits but can be obtained in court.

12:12 a.m.

President Donald Trump sought the removal of special counsel Robert Mueller, discouraged witnesses from cooperating with prosecutors and prodded aides to mislead the public on his behalf.

That's according to a hugely anticipated report from Mueller that details multiple efforts the president made to curtail a Russia probe he feared would cripple his administration.

Mueller writes that Trump's attempts to seize control of the investigation, and directions to others on how to influence it, ""were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.""

1058,"FAA aims to improve flight plans, reduce jet noise at Orlando International Airport","0 FAA aims to improve flight plans, reduce jet noise at Orlando International Airport

ORLANDO, Fla. - The Federal Aviation Administration wants to change how planes are routed through the skies over Central Florida.

It's promising less air pollution and fewer delays, despite record-setting traffic out of Orlando International Airport.

The FAA is now asking for input on new takeoff and landing routes.

TRENDING NOW:

FAA officials said its new metroplex program does not specifically aim to make things quieter... But it could happen.

People living in Orlando International Airport's flight paths hear flights overhead an average of 876 times a day. And as high as that number is, some residents said it seems even higher.

""Every time I go out the door, there's a plane going overhead,"" said resident Heidi Gebhardt.

Gebhardt was surprised when she moved to Winter Park and discovered jet noise miles from the airport.

""I can deal with it during the day, but at night, sometimes it does get annoying,” Gebhardt said. “It will wake you up.""

As planes multiply across the skies, FAA administrators have hit the road, trying to find the best solution to getting them to their destinations safely. The Sunshine State is particularly challenging.

""Florida uniquely has four major metropolitan international airports,” said FAA Regional Administrator Michael O’Harra. “No other state in the country has that.""

The FAA wants to use satellite navigation to narrow the tracks they fly, cut down on the clutter and save travelers some time.

On Wednesday, O'Harra told airport administrators a similar project in Houston saved 600,050 miles of unnecessary flying last year.

By flying more efficiently, it's possible that planes could end up flying more quietly.

""There's a possibility that as aircraft fly more precise routes that they can begin their descent farther out from the airport and fly that approach with reduced power,"" O'Harra said.

The actual changes are a couple of years away. The FAA said it will have more noise data at a round of public meetings around this time next year.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - Like many families, Crystal and Rich Colbert play with their four children after school each day. But their family's ""normal"" didn't come easily.

""This was when they inserted her through the catheter into my uterus,"" Crystal said as she pointed to a tiny spot on a picture of an ultrasound image. Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Photo provided by Crystal and Rich Colbert)

Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Photo provided by Crystal and Rich Colbert)

What she is pointing to is an embryo. That embryo is now her 3-year-old daughter, Nora. Nora was donated to the Colbert family as an embryo.

Embryo donation is still a relatively new concept, but it's an option that helped Rich and Crystal when they learned she couldn't have children.

""All my life I wanted to be a mom, and it just did not come easy to me,"" Crystal said.

For five years they tried before they turned down the road of fostering. They adopted two children through foster care, but Crystal still had that yearning to experience pregnancy.

""I really never thought I would be able to carry a child,"" she said.

Then she heard about embryo donation.

""There are around 500,000, give or take, embryos frozen in the United States,"" said Dr. Sandy Goodman with the Reproductive Medicine Group in Tampa.

Dr. Goodman explains the embryos come from families hoping to start their own families through in vitro fertilization. Around 3,000 children have been born through embryo donation according to the National Fertility Support Center.

""Sometimes couples will complete their family, and there will be more embryos than they would like to transfer. And sometimes they will donate their embryos,"" Dr. Goodman said. ""Some of them remain frozen until a couple decides what they want to do. And others are donated to science.""

So what if the parents who donate their embryos eventually want to meet that child who was born to other parents? Just like adoptions, there are open cases and then others are donated anonymously.

That's the case with the Colbert family.

The couple looked through 50 different profiles before they picked their batch.

""Our daughters were frozen for 11 and 13 years,"" Crystal said. ""They were created in 2003 and so they were just like frozen and waiting!""

The first round of embryo transfers didn't work but with the second try, Crystal finally heard what she'd been longing so desperately to hear - her baby's heartbeat.

""It had been, at that point, seven years of trying to have a baby and so to hear her heartbeat was pretty miraculous that maybe we were going to get to have a baby,"" she said.

After her daughter Nora was born, they used their last embryo in the batch and had Evyn. Two biological sisters, carried by and born to a different mother. It's something Crystal keeps out in the open with the kids.

""We kind of tell the kids that we got baby seeds from another family, that they were done with all their baby seeds and we needed some to make a family. Then the doctor put the baby seeds in mommy's belly and then we got a Nora and an Evyn,"" she said.

Embryo donation is a concept some find controversial.

""I've heard women say IVF is like playing God,"" Crystal said, admitting she tried to push the idea away for some time. ""In the end, I didn't want to look back and have any regrets.""

1061,Mermaid tryouts delayed for Weeki Wachee Springs,"Mermaid tryouts delayed for Weeki Wachee Springs Video

HERNANDO COUNTY, Fla. - If you’ve ever dreamt of being a mermaid, well now you can!! Weeki Wachee springs is holding mermaid auditions next Friday April 16 for those who may be interested in joining their team.

“One myth is that everybody, or people might say that mermaids are not real but here we are and we are swimming every day as a mermaid so we are as real as anything else can be,” said Stayce McConnell.

Stayce McConnell is the lead mermaid at Weeki Wachee Springs State Park and has been swimming around for more than a decade.

“My favorite part would be just swimming for the families and the kids, especially the looks on their faces and also just being underwater is just a magical feeling,” said McConnell.

In an underwater theatre the mermaids splash around in the beautiful, clear spring water and provide family friendly entertainment year-round.

While the job looks fun, it’s certainly not easy.

“There’s an endurance swim we start off with. It’s a 400 yard swim. You have to do it in 16 minutes. Then if you pass that we go to the underwater part of it where we make you go underwater do a breath hold, a couple ballet moves that we teach you how to do,” said McConnell.

Right now the park has 24 mermaids and while dozens will audition, it’s likely only four will make the cut.

The position is a paid job starting at $12 an hour but as the mermaids like to say, it’s not about the money, it’s about the charm.

“It’s more or less being a part of something. And being underwater is just amazing and swimming and performing for all the kids and the families, it’s a wonderful experience and there’s nothing else like it in the world,” said McConnell.

Auditions had to be moved to April 26 at 2 p.m. because of Friday's storms. They will take up to two hours. Participants must be 18 years old, pass and endurance swim test and an underwater audition.

Walk up’s are not accepted. You must submit an application before showing up.

1062,23 palm trees to come down in College Park,"ORLANDO, Fla. - The ax is about to swing for several dozen trees along Edgewater Drive in the College Park area after many grew too big for the past 15 years.

The city of Orlando recently released a public notice:

The City of Orlando has recently performed a careful inventory of trees along Edgewater Drive. That inventory has led to the decision that a number trees could be unsafe due to declining health of the tree or interference with electrical wires. To ensure safety of visitors and businesses of the district, the City will be removing a total of 23 trees along Edgewater Drive as well as trimming a total of 26 trees. Once trees are removed, the City will be pouring concrete into the existing tree wells to make the sidewalk surface even and safe.

""They are growing up into the power lines,"" said David Wagg, Orlando Parks assistant division manager. ""A couple main risks, damage to the power lines during a storm or a hurricane and second, there's a potential the trees could be energized because they're in the power lines.""

Crews plan to begin work Saturday morning and work through the day, potentially causing some sidewalk closures and lane shifts.

""We are constantly looking to plant trees, so we're looking for ways to plant trees particularly in the College Park area,"" Wagg said.

Because of this issue, city leaders said they've learned from the past.

""We've developed some standards over the past few years, the ways we plant trees, where we plant trees,"" Wagg said. ""We have a system now, 'Right Tree, Right place.' The trees have to be compatible with other things in the city. We're trying to avoid conflicts down the road and we're trying to not plant headaches for the next guy in 20 years who's going to be doing this job.""

1063,Murder trial for killer clown suspect set for 2020,"Sheila Keen Warren sits in a Palm Beach County courtroom during a Jan. 7, 2019, hearing in West Palm Beach, Florida.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A South Florida woman accused of dressing up as a clown and killing her future husband's wife in 1990 will stand trial early next year.

Palm Beach County Judge Joseph Marx has set jury selection in the murder trial of Sheila Keen Warren for Jan. 31, 2020.

Keen Warren wasn't in the courtroom during Wednesday's hearing to determine a trial date.

During a 2017 news conference, Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Detective Paige McCann said that Sheila Keen, as she was known at the time, was dressed like a clown when she fatally shot Marlene Warren at her Wellington home on May 26, 1990.

""Marlene answered the front door and the clown had two balloons, as well as a bouquet of flowers, and went to hand Marlene those items,"" McCann told reporters.

Marlene Warren, who had been eating breakfast with her then-22-year-old son and several of his friends, was surprised and commented, ""How nice.""

""It was at that time that the clown pulled out a gun and shot Marlene in the face,"" McCann said.

The clown then calmly walked back to the white Chrysler LeBaron in which she had arrived and drove away.

Marlene Warren died at a hospital two days later.

Marlene Warren was fatally shot in the face by a woman who was dressed as a clown in May 1990.

Keen Warren had long been considered a suspect in the shooting, but it took investigators 27 years to make an arrest. She eventually married Michael Warren in 2002 and moved to Tennessee, where the couple operated a restaurant.

In September 2017, Keen Warren was charged with first-degree murder and arrested in Virginia.

Keen Warren faces the death penalty if convicted.

1064,Brevard woman arrested in toddler's death after taking him to fire station,"MELBOURNE, Fla. - The mother of 1-year-old boy who died after she took him to a Melbourne fire station because the child was in distress has been arrested on manslaughter charges, according to authorities.

Emily Hartman, 26, of Palm Bay, was arrested on charges of aggravated manslaughter by child neglect, possession of cocaine with intent to seel and possession of marijuana. She's scheudled to make her first appearance before a judge Wednesday.

Earlier this month, Hartman took her her 14-month-old son to the fire house, and it was determined he was suffering from a heat-related illness, officials said. Details about what caused his illness have not been released.

""I spoke to one of our guys and said, 'Hey, he’s having active seizures, we need to get him some medication on board,' and at that time one of the other medics was starting an IV in the kid's arm,"" Fire Department Chief Phil Leitz said.

Leitz said the boy was unconscious, unresponsive, diaphoretic and pale. He said firefighters treated the toddler on a workout bench in the fire station while his mother paced around and talked on the phone.

""She was pretty upset. We asked her where she'd been and what she had been doing with the child. She said she had been running some errands and stuff like that,"" Leitz said.

The boy was taken to the Holmes Regional Medical Center and was flown to AdventHealth for Children in Orlando for further treatment, but he died a couple of days later, officials said.

No other details have been released.

1068,Pensacola man arrested for allegedly attempting to rape fiancee,"A Pensacola man was arrested last week after allegedly attempting to rape his fiancée last year.

Cecil Young, 57, was arrested and charged with battery, second or subsequent offense. He has prior convictions for battery in 1996 and 1999, according to his arrest report.

The incident that led to Young’s most recent arrest occurred almost one year ago on May 7, 2018. Young’s accuser contacted the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office two days later, on May 9, 2018, the report stated.

Shortly thereafter, a warrant was issued for Young’s arrest, said Maj. Andrews Hobbs, spokesman for the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office.

Hobbs said details on Young’s nearly year-long evasion of law enforcement and how Young managed to avoid capture were not available.

Hobbs said a deputy pulled over a suspicious vehicle driving on Pensacola Boulevard around 3:30 a.m. April 11 and found Young inside. The deputy made the arrest based on the outstanding warrant.

Young was booked into the Escambia County Jail on a $10,000 bond.

The warrant was issued for Young's arrest after investigators met the man's ex-fiancée, along with her pastor, at a church on May 9, 2018, according to his arrest report.

The woman told deputies that Young had tried to rape her two days prior on May 7, 2018, the report stated.

The pastor told deputies that he had spoken with Young earlier on May 7, and Young had made it clear that he wanted to marry the woman “very soon,” the report stated.

The pastor told Young he would not marry the couple until he got to know Young better and unless the couple attended several premarital counseling sessions. The pastor said this caused Young to “explode” in anger, the report stated.

The woman told deputies that after Young’s talk with the pastor, he’d started drinking heavily. She claimed that later that evening, he attempted to rape her, and she told him to stop and kicked him off of her.

The next morning, the woman said, she told Young that he was no longer welcome at her home and she no longer wanted to marry him, the report stated.

The woman told deputies that Young showed up at her workplace May 9, 2018, asking for her, and she asked two of her male coworkers to make him leave, the report stated.

The workplace incident had intensified her fear of Young, she told deputies, and prompted her to call law enforcement, the report stated. Investigators’ attempts to contact Young failed and a warrant was issued for his arrest.

1069,"Lake Worth woman shoots husband during dispute about taxes, deputies say","Lisa Shannon shot her estranged husband who had come to her house to collect tax paperwork, deputies say.

LAKE WORTH, Fla. - A Lake Worth woman said she ""snapped"" when she picked up a gun and shot her estranged husband, who was at her house getting their tax paperwork, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.

Lisa Shannon, 55, was arrested Tuesday on an attempted murder charge.

According to a probable cause affidavit, Shannon shot her husband Monday after he came to her house to finalize the estranged couple's tax paperwork.

Detective Jan Hansen said he arrived at the scene and found the victim laying on the ground outside. He had been shot multiple times.

After surrendering to deputies, Shannon confessed to shooting her husband, whom she claimed had been ""very controlling, manipulative and angry towards her"" since their marriage in 2001.

Shannon told detectives they had been having financial problems for years and were in the process of getting a divorce, but they needed to fill out their tax paperwork.

""She stated that they were not in agreement on how to file for their taxes,"" the affidavit said.

While her husband was at the house, Shannon ""got into another heated argument"" with him, the affidavit said. She claimed her husband was antagonizing her by telling her to repair various items inside the house to help with the sale of the home.

""Lisa Shannon also mentioned that she recently found out Ralph Shannon has been secretly keeping money from her,"" the affidavit said.

As Ralph Shannon picked up his documents to leave, ""Lisa Shannon stated that he was laughing and/or smirking,"" the affidavit said.

That's when Lisa Shannon reached into an end table by the front door, pulled out a .38 revolver and shot Ralph Shannon, she told detectives.

Lisa Shannon said she just became enraged and ""snapped"" when she shot him, the affidavit said.

""I know I shot him more than once, multiple times,"" she told detectives.

Lisa Shannon then called 911 to report that she had shot him.

A neighbor told detectives she has witnessed numerous domestic incidents between the couple in the past, including a recent incident in which deputies had to be called to the home.

Detectives found a Smith & Wesson revolver at the scene. They said all five rounds were spent inside the gun's cylinder.

Ralph Shannon was taken to a hospital, where he remains in critical condition.

1074,Florida couple recounts cruise ship nightmare aboard Viking Sky,"Ken and Cindy Treadwell of Wellington had to be evacuated by helicopter from the crippled Viking Sky cruise ship in Norway Saturday after it experienced engine trouble.

WELLINGTON — When Ken and Cindy Treadwell booked their dream trip aboard the Viking Sky cruise ship, they never imagined they'd spend part of their vacation dangling in midair during a helicopter evacuation.

The Wellington residents were nearing the end of their scheduled 13-day vacation Saturday when the ship encountered engine trouble in an area known for rough, frigid waters.

The crew issued a mayday call, and more than half of the ship's 900 passengers later were airlifted by helicopter to safety, including the Treadwells.

""Everything was going smoothly for most of the trip, until Saturday,"" Ken Treadwell said.

They were in the ship's theater watching a movie when the lights began flickering, and then went out. When a nearby mini bar toppled over, throwing glass and china to the floor, they headed back to their rooms.

They got halfway there when the captain announced an emergency muster. The Treadwells reported to their muster station inside a restaurant on the second floor. Crews were handing out life jackets, Ken Treadwell said, when the ship listed violently and a wave of water blew out a door.

""The force of the North Sea, which was probably under 40 degrees at that point, blew into the restaurant and pushed everybody back — tables, chairs, people,"" he said. ""We were soaked above our ankles. I talked to people later who had gone under water. They thought they were going to drown from the distance to where the door was to where we were. That was when you could see the shock and panic on everybody's face at that point.""

The Treadwells and about 400 other passengers were moved to the theater. The captain updated them regularly while they were there, and they were told that helicopters would evacuate the passengers 20 at a time.

The Treadwells were selected for helicopter evacuation, and began a four-hour trip up the stairwell to get to the seventh deck.

As they waited to be hoisted up into the helicopter, the ship listed again and the Treadwells were thrown against a wall.

""A squall came up, and it was sleeting sideways in our faces,"" said Ken Treadwell, an attorney.

The Treadwells eventually were evacuated with about 15 other passengers. They were taken to a soccer practice facility in a remote town on the Norwegian coast, where they were met by members of the Norwegian military and the Red Cross.

""They were wonderful,"" Cindy Treadwell said.

The passengers were bused to a hotel in the town of Kristiansand — about an hour away — and spent part of Sunday at a shopping mall.

""Viking gave us 2,500 Norwegian Krone — about $300 — to spend to get some clothes, because when we got off the ship we had no passport, no ID and no money,"" Ken Treadwell said. ""Just the clothes on our backs.""

They returned to the hotel, and later Sunday were bused back to the ship, which had been towed to the nearby port of Molde along with the remaining passengers and crew. They packed their belongings, spent the night onboard and took a charter flight to Oslo the next day. They returned to Fort Lauderdale later Monday, and arrived home around 1 a.m. Tuesday.

Ken Treadwell said he and Cindy, who have three children and five grandchildren, woke up Tuesday a little shaky and stunned by what happened on the Viking Sky, but also grateful. The WiFi stayed up while they were in the theater waiting to be evacuated, and Ken Treadwell was able to connect with fellow volunteers at CROS Ministries' food pantry in Lake Worth.

""We know we had a few prayer chains going there with us,"" Ken Treadwell said. ""I think while we were going through the ordeal, that had an impact."" The Treadwells' church, St. Peter's United Methodist in Wellington, mentioned the couple during Sunday services.

The Treadwells credit the Viking Sky crew for remaining professional throughout the ordeal and keeping everyone calm. The chairman of Viking also visited passengers at their hotel in Norway to apologize for the ordeal and to offer a full refund for the cruise — which the Treadwells say cost about $18,000 — as well as a complimentary future cruise on Viking Sky.

Ken Treadwell said he and Cindy, a retired public health nurse, probably will go back on Viking Sky, but with a different itinerary.

""I will not go to the North Sea again,"" he said.

1081,Rosanne Cash brings 'She Remembers Everything' to Opening Nights finale,"CLOSE An excerpt from Ken Burns' documentary ""Country Music"" on PBS

The daughter of country music legend Johnny Cash is embracing women’s narratives.

Rosanne Cash’s latest album, ""She Remembers Everything,"" is a poetic, lush and soulful collection of songs that reckon with a flawed and complex world. The album follows her triple-Grammy-winning 2014 release ""The River & the Thread""; it marks a return to more personal songwriting, after a trio of albums that explored her Southern roots and family heritage.

""I would best describe ('She Remembers Everything') as ‘feminine Gothic,'"" said Cash on the red carpet before last year's Americana Honors and Awards show, where she received the ""Spirit of Americana"" Free Speech Award. ""It's all new songs, some I wrote with John (husband John Leventhal) and a couple other co-writers – T Bone Burnett, Lera Lynn, Sam Phillips – so I’m really excited about it.""

Cash will perform a show named for that album as the finale of Opening Nights' 2018-19 season on Saturday, April 27 at Ruby Diamond Concert Hall. It will be her second visit to Tallahassee – she performed with Kris Kristofferson at Ruby Diamond in 2007.

With a music career spanning more than three decades, Cash has established herself as one of the country’s most preeminent singer/songwriters. She has released 15 albums that have earned four Grammy Awards, 11 Grammy nominations and 21 Top 40 hits — including 11 No. 1 singles.

Her music bridges the genres of country, pop, folk, blues, rock and Americana. Cash has had a number of hit singles that cross musical genres and have landed on both country and pop charts.

""She Remembers Everything"" was released in November to rave reviews. The album features 10 strong, gripping songs – all written or co-written by Cash – celebrating the eternal dance between love and loss, the art of finding solidity of spirit in a precarious world, how we rise when we fall short, and what it means to wrest beauty from the wreckage of the soul.

This album is the sum of all Cash’s parts — the outspoken activist, the woman with almost a dozen No. 1 hits, the daughter of a country music superstar. Her music is personal in a universal way, playing on the emotions of joy, pain and sadness that we can all relate to.

Cash was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters’ Hall of Fame in 2015. And she really does remember it all.

1082,Forecast: Severe weather possible Friday afternoon,"- A cold front is expected to blow through the Bay Area on Friday, bringing a chance of severe storms and even the possibility of some tornados.

It’s the same front that is currently powering a line of storms from Chicago all the way down through Texas, dropping egg-sized hail in some places.

“There’s a lot of energy from this front and eventually it’s all going to slide our way,” FOX 13 meteorologist Dave Osterberg explained, pointing to the very active radar map.

The worst of the weather will likely arrive in Central Florida after noon Friday. The National Weather Service expects a “slight to enhanced” chance of severe storms, which is about the middle of their threat scale. Heavy rain, frequent lightning, and isolated tornadoes are possible.

There is also a lake wind and small craft advisory going into effect Thursday evening.

“This whole line is going to come whipping through,"" Osterberg continued. ""Out ahead of it, gusty winds and we’re looking at the potential for some coastal flooding, believe it or not. These tides are going to run a couple of feet above normal due to all of this wind.”

There may be some lingering showers Friday night as the front passes, but it will be followed by cooler and drier air for the weekend.

“Easter is really looking nice, with temperatures topping out in the 70s and lower humidity,” meteorologist Jim Weber added.

1083,Foodie Fix: No Name Chinese,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Located in South Miami along Southwest 74th street and 57th court sits a restaurant with no name. Yup! Welcome to No Name Chinese.

""We couldn't agree on a name, so we decided not to put a name on the restaurant. We wanted to do some creative dim sum and lots of dumplings so that's what we are doing,"" said Pablo Zitzmann, Executive Chef of No Name Chinese.

Why need a name if the food speaks for itself? At the Chinese eatery, you can find traditional dishes with a Miami twist.

""We have some fun takes on take out dishes and old-school dim sum. I love Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai, so I play around with those flavors,"" said Zitzmann.

The extensive menu features a variety of small plates and dim sum bites like salads and dumplings filled with everything from pork to chicken. Bigger dishes feature new takes on old school classics, like the Kung Pao Chicken.

""I put some chili oil in the wok, then we add some chicken, some nuts, some chili peppers, some Szechuan pepper corns, cilantro stems, and then we are going to deglaze it with some Chinese cooking wine, add some sugar, and some scallion greens. When plating it, I'm going to add what I had in the wok, and then top it with some nuts, sesame seeds, and some fresh orange slices,"" said Zitzmann.

And if we’re at Chinese restaurant, we definitely need some fried rice.

""First we add the egg, then add our vegetables, we mix those vegetables with the egg, then we add the rice, and stir it a couple of times. Then we put it on the plate and top it with a sunny side up egg and sliced chives,"" said Zitzmann.

1084,Mermaid tryouts on Friday for Weeki Wachee Springs,"Mermaid tryouts on Friday for Weeki Wachee Springs Video

HERNANDO COUNTY, Fla. - If you’ve ever dreamt of being a mermaid, well now you can!! Weeki Wachee springs is holding mermaid auditions tomorrow for those who may be interested in joining their team.

“One myth is that everybody, or people might say that mermaids are not real but here we are and we are swimming every day as a mermaid so we are as real as anything else can be,” said Stayce McConnell.

Stayce McConnell is the lead mermaid at Weeki Wachee springs state park and has been swimming around for more than a decade.

“My favorite part would be just swimming for the families and the kids, especially the looks on their faces and also just being underwater is just a magical feeling,” said McConnell.

In an underwater theatre the mermaids splash around in the beautiful, clear spring water and provide family friendly entertainment year-round.

While the job looks fun, it’s certainly not easy.

“There’s an endurance swim we start off with. It’s a 400 yard swim. You have to do it in 16 minutes. Then if you pass that we go to the underwater part of it where we make you go underwater do a breath hold, a couple ballet moves that we teach you how to do,” said McConnell.

Right now the park has 24 mermaids and while dozens will audition on Friday, it’s likely only four will make the cut.

The position is a paid job starting at $12 an hour but as the mermaids like to say, it’s not about the money, it’s about the charm.

“It’s more or less being a part of something. And being underwater is just amazing and swimming and performing for all the kids and the families, it’s a wonderful experience and there’s nothing else like it in the world,” said McConnell.

1085,Now Open: Lucky's Market in North Naples kicks off with bacon-cutting ceremony,"CLOSE Lucky's market President Chris Darling and Joseph Cummins, vice-president of new store operations open Lucky's Market in North Naples on Wednesday, April 17, 2019.

The bacon has been cut and the doors to Lucky's Market in North Naples are now open.

Hundreds of shoppers flooded the new Lucky’s Market in the Promenade Shops at Naples Centre located on Naples Boulevard on Wednesday morning.

The new grocery store kicked off its grand opening with the cutting of a large slab of pork belly in place of the traditional yellow ribbon cutting ceremony.

“At Lucky’s Market we don’t cut ribbons to grand open our store, we cut bacon,” said Vice President of Operations Joseph Cummins.

Everyone in the store began to count down as the butcher prepared to slice the 14 to 18-pound slab of smoked pork belly with a large knife.

Employees with trays of freshly cooked bacon walked around offering free samples for shoppers to enjoy.

“We’re proud to be here and we hope to challenge your concept of what grocery store shopping can truly be,” said Lucky’s Market President, Chris Darling.

Lucky’s offers a “Sip & Stroll” program where customers can purchase a $2 pint of beer or $3 glass of wine or fresh-pressed juice, “Nitro” coffee or kombucha tea to enjoy while shopping.

The store also brings in live entertainment throughout the week to create a fun and unique atmosphere for shoppers.

“We don’t want to just be a place that you say, ‘I have to go get my groceries,’” Darling said. This should become a place, and we are going to strive to be a place, that you just want to come to and that there’s just a feeling and something great about just being here.”

John Barretti of Naples said he likes the fact that he can sip a cold beer while shopping.

“Grocery shopping isn’t my favorite thing to do, but if I can drink beer while doing it then count me in,” he said.

“It’s right in the neighborhood and I love the set up,” Lynn Stevens said as she filled her cart with fresh produce Wednesday morning.

The store also features a full apothecary department, which has been designed to deliver a unique experience with a bulk DIY wall where people can buy what they need to make their own teas, salves, tinctures, healing elixirs and more.

Founders of Lucky’s Market, Bo and Trish Sharon were not present for the grand opening but visited the new store days before.

The couple from Colorado, who are both chefs, founded the grocery store in 2003 and now have 35 stores in 11 states.

The North Naples location has nearly 150 employees, including an in-house butcher, chefs and employees who will hand out samples to shoppers as they walk around the store.

In addition to Lucky's drive to provide the best fresh food options to shoppers, the grocer also is dedicated to helping end world hunger by donating food they are not able to sell but is still edible to local food banks.

""Last year we donated more than one million pounds of food to individuals around the country,"" said regional marketing specialist at Lucky's, Samantha Greenberg.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

During the grand opening, a $7,500 Impact Grant was presented on behalf of Lucky’s Market to local organization, Youth Haven, to help purchase garden and kitchen supplies in support of their Community Garden Project and Life Skills HUB’s Cooking Seminars.

Lucky’s also is supporting the community by carrying out a fundraiser called Bags for Change through August 17, 2019 where shoppers reusing their shopping bags can choose to get a 10-cent credit on their purchase or to donate to their local non-profit organization of choice including: Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Sun Coast, Girls on the Run of Southwest Florida or Literacy Volunteers of Collier County.

The grand opening for the new Lucky’s in North Naples is the second location the store has opened in Naples and another location is expected to open by 2020 near Bonita Springs.

In January 2016, Lucky’s Market made its debut in Southwest Florida, opening in East Naples at 3815 U.S. 41 at the Naples Towne Centre.

The natural foods grocer has also signed leases for additional stores to open in the next few years in Fort Myers and Cape Coral.

1087,Inspirational speaker coming to speak to Hurricane Michael victims,"PANAMA CITY — Deep in the days of rebuilding, recovery, and quite a bit of hurricane-related resentment, Panama City will be treated to a free community event Friday called “HOPE for the Florida Panhandle” featuring Scott Burrows.

Burrows will speak from 7-9 p.m. Friday at Mosley High School’s Gretchen Nelson Fine Arts Center. Tickets will be available at the venue starting at 6 p.m. Doors close at 6:45 p.m.

Burrows is an inspirational speaker who worked to overcome great adversity as a young man. Today, he travels the world inspiring others to keep working even in the face of despair.

With experience in golfing and karate as a child, track, football and kickboxing in high school — with his last kickboxing match broadcast on ESPN — and then participation as a walk-on wide receiver for Florida State University in 1983, Burrows was deeply rooted in the life of an athlete as a young man.

Then, on Nov. 3, 1984, at just 19 years old, Burrows was involved in a car accident that paralyzed his body from the chest down. Burrows was told he never would walk again.

“Once I tried to get my life back together to get through dealing with a different life, living in a different body, my dad was insistent that I go back to college,” said Burrows. “I did. I got my Bachelor of Science degree in finance, got into the insurance financial industry when I left, specializing in disability insurance planning.”

Burrows described his career after his accident as turning lemons into lemonade.

At a conference about 10 years after the accident, Burrows attended a talk by former prisoner of war Charlie Plumb. He was immediately enraptured.

“I thought, ‘Man I could see myself doing that for the rest of my life,’ ” he said.

In 2002, fully engaged in his second career partnering in an international business venture with his brother, Burrows began studying the craft, hiring coaches, and finally made the move to sharing his experience worldwide.

“One thing led to another and I’ve been around the world now a couple times,” he said.

Today, Burrows has spoken to many Fortune 500 companies at conferences and associations to inspire others through navigating change — an extremely applicable subject for those living in the wake of Hurricane Michael — to keep pushing.

Working in Panama City will be unique for him, he said, which is exciting.

“It’s just amazing what’s happening, so I just hope I can share my message using my story as a backdrop to maybe look at the challenges differently and understand what can come out of it,” he said. “Maybe some ideas of what you can do better as you’re going through it. Maybe leave them inspired.”",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190418/inspirational-speaker-coming-to-speak-to-hurricane-michael-victims?rssfeed=true,2019-04-18T06:50:00Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
1088,City's Independent Ethics Board proposes steeper fines for lobbyists,"The city's Independent Ethics Board met Tuesday at City Hall. (Photo: Jeff Burlew)

The city of Tallahassee’s Independent Ethics Board proposed steeper fines for lobbyists and will take a deeper dive into issues involving the influence industry within the next couple of months.

On Tuesday, the Ethics Board proposed raising fines for lobbyists who fail to register from $500, which is in current city ordinance, to $1,000 for the first violation, $2,500 for the second and $5,000 for the third. Fourth violations would result in suspension of lobbying privileges for up to three years.

The Ethics Board proposed the changes as part of its overhaul of the city’s ethics code, though restrictions on lobbyists are located elsewhere in city ordinance. Members unanimously signed off on the higher fines.

The back story:

• Citizens group wants more Ethics Board oversight of city lobbyists

• City's Independent Ethics Board finalizes draft of tougher new ordinance

The board also debated but ultimately punted on a suggestion by Citizens for Ethics Reform that would require city officials to monitor their meetings with lobbyists. Richard Herring, chair of the Ethics Board, pledged that the board will take up the proposal and other lobbying issues in an upcoming meeting.

His comments came after Peter Butzin, a member of Citizens for Ethics Reform, pointed to a Tallahassee Democrat article showing behind-the-scenes lobbying and consulting around the city’s broadband issue. City Commissioners last month initially supported but reversed course on exploring creation of a municipal-run broadband internet utility.

“There’s a whole variety of issues here I think that we can look at and then make a recommendation to the city,” Herring said. “We’ll have an in-depth discussion.”

Butzin said the citizens group has no doubt that the city’s list of registered lobbyists is incomplete.

“This is an important issue,” he said. “If you defer it, we’ll understand that. But we will certainly come back and encourage you to get a handle on this problem because it’s a major one in Tallahassee.”

The board also proposed moving oversight of lobbyists from the ethics officer to the Ethics Board and the treasurer-clerk’s office. The City Commission is expected to take up the recommendations perhaps later this spring.

(Photo: HOBIE HILER/SPECIAL TO TCPALM)

MARTIN COUNTY— Health professionals vaccinated about 200 people against hepatitis A at the local health department Monday and Tuesday.

It's been a ""very good response"" from the community since the agency announced free vaccines for under-insured and uninsured people, if they qualify, said Renay Rouse, the health department's Martin County spokeswoman.

The agency regularly vaccinates people for hepatitis A because the vaccination is popular for residents to get if they plan to travel internationally, she said.

On Thursday, the agency will extend its hours from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. to ensure residents who are under-insured or uninsured can receive the two-part vaccine. Normal hours after Thursday will be 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. The agency is at 3441 S.E. Willoughby Blvd.

1090,Brevard mother arrested in toddler's death after taking him to fire station,"MELBOURNE, Fla. - The mother of 1-year-old boy who died after she took him to a Melbourne fire station because the child was in distress has been arrested on manslaughter charges, according to authorities.

Emily Hartman, 26, of Palm Bay, was arrested on charges of aggravated manslaughter by child neglect, possession of cocaine with intent to sell and possession of marijuana. She's scheduled to make her first appearance before a judge Wednesday.

Earlier this month, Hartman took her 14-month-old son to the fire house, and it was determined he was suffering from a heat-related illness, officials said. Details about what caused his illness have not been released.

""I spoke to one of our guys and said, 'Hey, he’s having active seizures, we need to get him some medication on board,' and at that time one of the other medics was starting an IV in the kid's arm,"" Fire Department Chief Phil Leitz said.

Emily Hartman.

Leitz said the boy was unconscious, unresponsive, diaphoretic and pale. He said firefighters treated the toddler on a workout bench in the fire station while his mother paced around and talked on the phone.

""She was pretty upset. We asked her where she'd been and what she had been doing with the child. She said she had been running some errands and stuff like that,"" Leitz said.

The boy was taken to the Holmes Regional Medical Center and was flown to AdventHealth for Children in Orlando for further treatment, but he died a couple of days later, officials said.

No other details have been released.

1093,"Roadside memorial in Palm Bay draws support, criticism","It was supposed to be a day of new beginnings. Instead, it turned out to be one of heart-rending tragedy for Frank Caufield and his family.

Buy Photo Frank and Jeannie Caufield of Satellite Beach, at the temporary roadside memorial along Malabar Road in Palm Bay to their grandson Zach Caufield, 19, who was killed at night in a crash where Hoffer Avenue ends at the Melbourne Tillman Canal system. (Photo: TIM SHORTT/ FLORIDA TODAY)

That was the day the 68-year-old learned his 19-year-old grandson Zachary — who was supposed to have a college interview the following day — died after driving off a road and plunging head-on into a grassy, southwest Palm Bay canal.

“He was driving on his way home when the crash happened,” said Frank Caufield, a Satellite Beach resident. “He had just turned 19 in November and the last time I saw him, on Christmas, he was telling me that he wanted to go to Eastern Florida State College to study air conditioning. He was just one of those kids who was really outgoing.”

Now a roadside memorial to the teen, made up of two garden chairs, a tall cross plastered with photos and sun-faded flowers, is stirring controversy.

A couple neighbors want it removed.

Albert Messenger said the memorial is an eyesore that should be removed. He is one of two who contacted Melbourne Tillman Canal authorities about the memorial. A hearing about it is 9 a.m. April 23 at West Melbourne City Hall.

Rules for memorials differ

The memorial, one of any number that dot roadsides across Palm Bay and throughout Brevard County, is the latest to stir emotion as loved ones co-opt the landscape to recall the lives of those killed in traffic crashes.

Among the ubiquitous tributes are memorials to those killed in crashes and accidents over the years: There's one to a 17-year-old Heritage High School student killed while walking along Emerson Drive; another dedicated to boy struck by a car on Minton Road. Further along on Malabar Road, there's one where the shrubbery is ringed with flowers, notes and weathered clothing for a man killed on a motorcycle.

State law does allow for small roadside markers to be placed on state roadways.

Municipalities, however, have varying rules, with some deferring to code enforcement if the tributes are deemed unruly.

""It's considered a private property issue for the most part,"" said Lt. Steve Bland of the Palm Bay Police Department. ""If it's on city property, then it can be something that code enforcement looks at.""

Keeping the memory

The Caufield family is taking up a petition drive to keep the tribute.

They also want more warnings placed along Hoffer Avenue. They believe Zachary Caufield drove into the canal because the warnings about it may not have been clear.

Palm Bay police said the investigation is open and did not release further details surrounding the circumstances leading to the deadly crash.

Melbourne Tillman authorities would not comment on the shrine but sent FLORIDA TODAY a copy of its policy that effectively bans such structures from being placed along any of its 163 miles of canal.

The roadside shrine to Caufield sits along the canal line and sits several yards from Hoffer Avenue and several neighborhood homes.

""It's out at the end of the community I live in. I oppose any of those that are not following the legal guidelines,"" Messenger said. ""I find it distracting. The family is overstepping their bounds. They could have done this at the cemetery.""

For their part, the family said they simply want to remember the teen at the spot where he died and hopefully to remind others to be careful.

They added a picture of his dog, Drac, a boxer who died March 27.

""They're together now,"" Frank Caufield said.

""To us, this is like hallowed ground. Somebody brought out the chairs. The flowers are there also. It's just a place for us to go and pay our respects to him and what we lost.""

1094,Notre Dame cathedral fire all too real for Naples couple there Monday,"The Notre-Dame de Paris on Monday, April 15, 2019. A short time later, the famed 800-year-old cathedral would catch fire and burn for hours. (Photo: Photo courtesy of Higor Valle)

Higor Valle and his fiancee Marina Yuli lined up to visit the famed cathedral of Notre Dame on Monday afternoon, but the line of tourists ahead of them was discouraging.

""We figured it would be at least an hour before we got in,"" said Valle, sommelier at The Continental in Naples. ""So we decide to walk around, enjoy its beauty and come back later.""

There would be no later for Notre Dame. The 800-year-old cathedral burned to a shell, with only its two main towers and the frame remaining.

The decision to leave the cathedral for other Paris sites for the pair was based on long lines waiting to enter the landmark that attracts 13 million visitors annually.

""If we had waited in line, we would have been inside when the fire started,"" Valle said soberly. He heard that other tourists were inside, unaware the fire had started until security guards rushed them out.

The couple snapped photos of the building's three famous portals, with their 13th-century religious characters and scenes, then decided to go to the Eiffel Tower for more photos in the meantime .

On their way back to their hotel, Valle recalled, they saw the plume of smoke rising, smoke so expansive that they first thought a storm was coming.

""It was all over the news. Everyone was talking by the time we got back to our hotel,"" said Valle, who described the mood in Paris as grim. He and Yuli returned Tuesday morning to see the remains, although the island on which the cathedral sits is cordoned off.

""People were looking, they were praying, some of them were crying,"" he said. ""Both of the towers were still there. But the entire inside is full of water.""

Fortunately, 16 statues had been removed last week for cleaning as part of a multimillion-dollar renovation. But Valle felt the inside of the church was extremely damaged.

1095,Palm Coast Songwriters Festival returns for an encore,"Looking to capture some magic in a bottle, organizers of last year’s Palm Coast Songwriters Festival are set to stage a second festival May 3-5.

Looking to capture some magic in a bottle, organizers of last year’s Palm Coast Songwriters Festival are set to stage a second festival May 3-5.

By inviting 14 award-winning county music singer/songwriters to Flagler County, they’re hoping audiences will be enticed by the level of talent poised to take over stages at Daytona State College's Palm Coast campus and at the Palm Coast Arts Foundation's site in Central Park at Town Center for the three-day event.

While the names of the participating singer/songwriters might not be familiar to some, the Grammy nominations, American Music Awards, Academy of Country Music, Billboard, BMI and Hall of Fame awards they've collected speak for themselves. And it’s the stories behind the songs they’ve written, and their willingness to share those moments with fans and strangers, that may be the most entertaining.

Scheduled performers include Jesse Rice, Lee Thomas Miller, Jim Collins, Stephony Smith, Tyler Reeve, James Slater, Anthony Smith, Brett Jones, Tom Shepherd, Coley McCabe, Jeffrey Steele, Kyle Sackley, Chris Wallin, Leslie Satcher.

Australian songwriter Kylie Sackley, chatting via telephone from her home in Nashville, Tennessee, said she's looking forward to visiting Palm Coast for the festival and explained how she got her start in Music City.

“I got into poetry when I was about 8 or 9 and, you know, you’ve got all these feelings when you’re young. You sit in your bedroom on your bed and write them all down and I just sort of caught the bug very young,” she said.

After winning a talent search competition, Sackley headed to Nashville when she was 19.

“I was an artist with a record deal in Australia when I came to Nashville to write for my first record,” Sackley said. “I fell in love with the town and very quickly realized that songwriting was my number one passion, not so much being in the spotlight.”

Her first hit song, “Nothin’ 'Bout Love Makes Sense,” was recorded and released in 2004 by country songstress LeAnn Rimes, an uncommon success for someone new to the industry.

“It happened very quickly for me and the longer I’ve been in Nashville, the more I realize how blessed I was,” said Sackley. “It was my first year of living in Nashville that I had a hit single on the radio and that does not happen, to be clear.”

Sackley’s success as a songwriter has pivoted around to being ahead of the curve over the nearly 17 years she’s been living in Nashville.

“I always felt like, directionally, the songs that I have written have been just a couple of years ahead of where radio was at the time, which has turned out to be such a blessing,” she said. “I think you’ve got to be smart, you have to listen to the radio, and just think ahead. If you’re chasing a trend that’s already on the radio, I promise you it’s been written a couple of years ago.”

She’s looking forward to visiting Palm Coast for the weekend and a chance to hang out with fellow songwriters she calls friends.

“I’ve been to a couple of festivals in Florida over the years but never Palm Coast, so I’m crazy excited to check out that part of Florida,” said Sackley. “I pretty much have either a friendship or writing relationship with most of the people going down there, so I’m excited to see all my friends, to share the stage, and share the stories behind the songs. It’s always so much fun to get outside of our Nashville element and if you put us on a beach we might get a little crazy.”

Created through a collaboration between country music fan Garry Lubi, a banker by day, and songwriter Thom Sheppard, last year’s festival introduced northeast Florida to a level of talent more typically seen in major cities. Lubi says this year’s festival, which takes place a few days before the Key West Songwriter’s Festival, puts Palm Coast on the map in a very special way.

“I think a lot of people just don’t realize what level of talent we’re bringing here,” Lubi said.

Single-day ticket prices are $15/$25 if purchased before April 27, and $20/$30 the week of the event while 3-day passes are $65/$95 before April 27 and $75/$125 after.

1096,Florida beachfront mansion sells for $14.9 million after more than year on market,"The luxury real estate market has been heating up in Collier County.

A beachfront mansion in the Pelican Bay area of Naples sold in February for $14.9 million after being on the market for over a year.

The four-story home, at 7607 Bay Colony Drive, fetched the third-highest price ever in the Pelican Bay area, and it was the highest-priced sale in The Strand — a private neighborhood in the Bay Colony community — in more than three years.

The two homes that hold the titles of most expensive and second most expensive sales in the secluded Bay Colony community previously sold for $24.5 million and $16.4 million.

The seller was represented by Joe Belz of Compass Florida and the buyer was represented by Jay Rourke of Sotheby's International Realty.

Belz believes realistic pricing is important when it comes to selling high-end homes.

“It (the home) wasn’t at the right price-point to begin with,” Belz said. “When you get up into that price-point there are a handful of sales a year and you have to be priced right to be a part of that handful.”

The four-bedroom, five-bathroom beachfront mansion was originally listed for $19.75 million in November of 2017.

Last summer the home was taken off the market and was re-listed at $16.75 million in October. The home was under contract within 90 days.

The 9,775-square-foot home, built in 1995, includes a separate guest bungalow, a media room, elevator and a gym.

Although the home doesn’t have a pool, the home features a private path to the beach.

The 3,000-square-foot master suite occupies the entire fourth floor of the home with views of the Gulf of Mexico and a mangrove preserve.

There are only 12 homes located in The Strand and almost all of them are Mediterranean styled homes.

Belz said other homes in The Strand have been on and off the market in the past couple years but because of a shift in design preferences from buyers it has been harder to sell the homes.

“For the most part, these homes have a very Mediterranean style which is not necessarily what today's buyers are looking for,” he said. “I think because of the shift in buyer preferences and the homes that have been on the market obviously not being priced aggressive enough ... that’s part of the reason why there hasn’t been that much activity in the past few years.”

To appeal to buyers, Belz said more aggressive pricing attracts those who are ready to take on major renovation projects, which we are seeing a lot of in Naples.

In the past six months, there were two home sales near the Port Royal neighborhood in which the new homeowners tore down dated multi-million-dollar homes to rebuild new ones.

The Southern-Colonial mansion at 2440 Gordon Drive sold in January for $22.5 million and was demolished March 11.

Neighboring the property is a large barren parcel, where the priciest home to ever sell in Southwest Florida went for $48.8 million in June and was demolished five months later.

1097,All the spraying makes for poor water quality in Florida: your say,"0403 Cartoon (Photo: Kevin Siers, The Charlotte Observer, NC)

Spraying overload

Spray, spray, spray.

They spray the air with chemicals for mosquitoes. They spray chemicals on lakes for weeds. They spray chemicals in canals for weeds. They spray chemicals under power lines for weeds. They spray chemicals along fence lines for weeds. They spray chemicals on road medians. The thousands and thousands of homeowners and landscapers spray chemicals on their lawns.

Here in Florida, everything ends up in the water, and now there is water quality problems. That is a surprise? Also don't forget the unlimited number of people moving here in their new home on land that was natural.

Guess what they are going to do? Spray, spray, spray.

Dark dangers

For the second time in a couple of months, a child has been killed by a vehicle near a dark predawn school bus stop.

Yet our senators, governor and state Legislature support year around daylight saving time for Florida. This would add another dangerous dark hour at the bus stops.

Justice needed

As an animal lover in general and a dog lover in particular, I was appalled at the story and pictures of Duncan a dog that was used as bait by being hung by his rear legs so other dogs can bite his face while he is defenseless.

It is beyond my comprehension how a human being can do this to an animal that feels pain just like the lowlife person that did this.

I can only hope that whoever is responsible for this atrocity will be brought to justice.

Install lights

Recently an 8-year-old girl sitting in the dark waiting for her school bus was killed by a hit-and-run driver. Why haven't these dark bus stops not been lighted?

It would be a simple matter: install a pole with a solar light at the top. Had the little girl been more visible, the accident might still have happened – but then again, it might not have happened.

Thousands of dollars have been spent on studies to make our schools safer. If school schedules require our children to wait in the dark for their buses, installing lights seems to be a common sense way to make them safer.

Chuck Borton, Cape Coral

Civic duty

Is socialist a name for the Democratic Party or just an insult? The word comes from sociare (to share). It was created by Henri de Saint-Simon, a founder of ""Utopian Socialism"" in contrast to the ""Liberal Doctrine of Individualism"" – that people should act in isolation.

Communism is socialism plus totalitarianism. Christian socialism in the 19th century held that capitalism was rooted in greed. Pure socialism was neither popular nor successful. Popes spoke against it as they did against unrestrained capitalism. The U.S. does not want to be identified as socialistic but, like every other country, they are half socialistic and half capitalistic.

Republican Teddy Roosevelt had universal health care in his 1901 campaign. Later candidates followed. In 1935, FDR introduced Social Security to eliminate poverty for the retired elderly. In 1965, Lyndon Johnson established Medicare that provides for over 60 million people.

It is inaccurate to call Democrats socialists, despite any extremists. Governments must protect the rights of private ownership but they are also mandated to care for the sick and the poor that is not pure socialism but their civic duty.

1105,Wife who says her husband died from Hepatitis A says he will always be her soulmate,"A local woman remains heartbroken after she says her husband, 61-year-old Lee Collins of Palm City, died as a result of Hepatitis A.

The virus has claimed three lives in Martin County and more than a dozen others have been infected, according to the health department.

“He was my soulmate. Is my soulmate and always will be my soulmate,” Collins said. “He’ll always be with me no matter where I go or what I do.”

Collins first met Lee when she was just 13 years old and she knew immediately he was the one

“His laugh was so contagious,"" she said. ""He’s got a beautiful smile. I miss his smile.""

Collins says Lee started feeling sick last month with flu-like symptoms.

“It was hard to believe that one day we’re camping and cooking out, and the next day we’re fighting to save his life,"" she said. ""I’m still in shock. I really am.""

Collins says when he didn’t get better after one week, she took him to the emergency room.

“They admitted him that night and the next morning is when they told us that he had the Hepatitis A virus,” she said. “They said it was going to be a couple days and it usually goes away.”

However, Collins says things only got worse, and despite a liver transplant, Lee didn’t survive.

“I still expect to roll over and him be next to me, or walk in the door or go for a ride to the beach, dinner, or date night,"" she said. ""We would go to date night once a week.""

Now as the health department works to get to the source of the Hepatitis A outbreak in Martin County, Collins wants to make sure no one else has to go through what she’s going through.

“Do your due diligence. When you feel sick don’t take it for granted. We did. We took it for granted,” she said. “We thought it was the flu. Get checked. Go to your doctor.”

Collins is also urging everyone to get the vaccine.

The Martin County Health Department is offering free Hepatitis A vaccines for uninsured, underinsured and at-risk adults.

They are holding extended hours Thursday on a walk-in basis from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.",http://cw34.com/news/local/wife-who-says-her-husband-died-from-hep-a-has-a-message-for-county-officials,2019-04-18T18:15:19Z,WTVX,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407
1106,"Brian Raftery On New Book ‘Best Movie Year Ever’, Reese Witherspoon & The Matrix – CBS Miami","



1999 was an all time great year for movies.

“The Matrix”, “Fight Club”, and “Office Space” all hit theaters 20 years ago and author Brian Raftery believes it’s time to properly label this time period. His new book “Best Movie Year Ever” features interviews with people like Reese Witherspoon, Edward Norton, Kirsten Dunst and Mike Judge about the masterpieces they created in 1999.

“I originally started working on a book proposal of that year,” said Raftery in an interview with CBS Local. “Halfway through, an editor at Simon & Schuster just emailed me out of the blue and asked if I had ever thought about just writing about the movies of that year. You can touch on the importance of Columbine and Y2K through the movies of that year. These films felt like they were accidentally trying to tell us what the future was going to be.”

Raftery’s favorite movie from that year was “Election,” which starred Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick. The author calls it a perfect movie.

“I watched all of these movies at least four or five times each,” said Raftery. “I watched them as movies and as commentary tracks. A lot of these movies are about middle aged guys that are stuck. It’s a really funny movie and really empathetic to all the characters. Reese Witherspoon is so good in this movie. She spent a couple of days in this high school in Nebraska, sneaking in as a student to blend in. She was a pretty big star at that point, but she was not Reese Witherspoon yet. You can see the timing that she has in movies like ‘Legally Blond’ starting in ‘Election.’

One of the most interesting movies of the year was “The Matrix.” The movie was filmed in Australia and it has several fascinating what ifs.

“The Wachowski’s hadn’t made anything like this before and they had written the script years ago,” said Raftery. “It had gone through all these executives, who didn’t fully understand it. It’s very compelling, but it’s very strange imagery. Warner Brothers had a tough time finding actors. They talked to Leonardo DiCaprio at one point, Will Smith, Michael Douglas, Arnold Schwarzenegger. At one point, they got so frustrated about not being able to find a lead that they even thought about rewriting Neo and offering it to Sandra Bullock.

1108,How Gulf Breeze lacrosse built toward its shot at area history,"CLOSE TJ Caldwell recovered from a meniscus tear and was named captain this year for Gulf Breeze lacrosse BRIAN ACHATZ, bachatz@pnj.com

Story Highlights Gulf Breeze girls lacrosse is looking to earn the area's first state tourney win

Veteran KateReagan Costello is the state's leader in assists by a wide margin

The Dolphins' playoff run will begin against a team its already beaten this season

Pensacola Catholic High School was the site of yet another district coronation for the Gulf Breeze girls lacrosse team on Wednesday night.

In sweeping through Pensacola High 17-5, the Dolphins claimed a fourth consecutive district title while remaining the only area girls team to win a district title in the sport’s young area history.

There has been some drama in that dominant run – none greater than Pensacola High’s thrilling upset bid in 2018 – but overall there’s been little question that the area’s top girls side resides just on the other side of Pensacola Bay.

That local success has yet to translate to the state tournament, however, as the Pensacola area still awaits its first FHSAA state tournament victory in girls lacrosse.

With Buchholz ending Oak Hall’s seven-year reign atop Gainesville’s district on Wednesday night, that opportunity may never be greater for the Dolphins (17-2), particularly as Gulf Breeze already thumped Buchholz 16-7 in Gainesville earlier this season.

“It’s always been trying to get through Oak Hall, but also in past years it’s been getting through Buchholz,” Gulf Breeze girls lacrosse head coach Carlee Costello said. “We hadn’t beaten them in six years and this year we really cleaned up with them and did a great job in working hard. We’ll see what happens Thursday.”

Gulf Breeze lacrosse four-year build

Of all Costello’s locally-dominant Gulf Breeze teams, there likely hasn’t been one with a resume quite as impressive as her 2019 team.

The Dolphins’ two losses have come by a combined two goals, earning Gulf Breeze a No. 11 state ranking on MaxPreps, while three separate players have scored more than 50 goals already this season.

Costello's daughter, KateReagan, has long been one of the Panhandle’s brightest talents, earning multiple PNJ Player of the Year honors. She’s now emerged as one of Florida’s overall leaders, topping the state with 50 assists and placing second overall in points (109) thanks to her 57 total goals.

Costello’s talent will take her to Division I Duquesne in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania next year, making her the Panhandle’s first Division I girls lacrosse signee. She hopes to carry a bit more area history with her before her collegiate journey north.

“Since I was a freshman it’s always been the plan or dream (to win in the state playoffs),” KateReagan Costello said. “I think we have a chance this year with a stellar goalie and Lizzy Christ coming on and Clarke Haas up to speed, because we didn’t have her last year.”

For Haas, local lacrosse history runs in the family as her older brother Noah, who now plays at NCAA Division II Belmont Abbey, led Gulf Breeze to an undefeated regular season and helped the Dolphins become the first local lacrosse team to advance in the FHSAA state tournament.

Standing tall above most of her opponents, Haas poured in five goals in Wednesday’s district title win, bringing her season total to 61 in a successful comeback from a cartilage tear in her wrist that kept her out most of last season.

“If we’re going to do it any year, this is our year,” Haas said. “We’ve worked so hard in practices and we’re in Phase 3 now of running so we’re in the best shapes of our lives. It would mean a lot if we can beat (Buchholz).”

Costello conditioning

A common refrain in Gulf Breeze’s rising confidence comes from the team’s belief in Costello’s grueling conditioning campaign.

From Haas to the younger Costello, players vouched for the physical fitness levels the Dolphins achieved in a “phase” running program that saw players build from daily short sprints into longer, higher-intensity running later in the season.

“We call what we’re working on (right now) Phase 3 and we’re doing a lot of running so we can run Buchholz into the ground and be in shape and keep our stick skills up,” KateReagan Costello said. “I think it’s going to be a win. I hope and know so.”

Between their conditioning and belief in goalie Victoria Christ, who is among Florida’s top five leaders in goals against average and save percentage, the Dolphins will enter Thursday’s region quarterfinal invigorated with the self-belief of a team ready to make history.

If that confidence is justified, there may just be a few more games together for the Costello’s as coach and player.

“I think she has a couple more (games) left in her high school career,” Carlee Costello said. “I actually got a little teary-eyed today because she got her uniform from Duquesne and all that stuff… A little mom moment putting the sizes in her for her gear next year.”

Pensacola High duo eclipses 100 goals

Despite seeing their season end on Wednesday night, Pensacola (11-4) saw goals from senior Lillian Wiggins and junior Shannon Duffy. The duo have managed decorated careers for the Tigers and eclipsed 100 career goals earlier this season.

1109,TooJay's Deli in Naples has chutzpah that's too good to pass over — Restaurant review,"CLOSE TooJay’s Deli Bakery Restaurant opened in early March 2019 at Mercato in North Naples. Tim Aten, tim.aten@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4857

The new TooJay's Deli is one of the only Jewish or Kosher-style delis from Naples to Fort Myers. It's not perfect, but it can be oh-so geshmak.

The line at TooJay's Deli started at the host stand.

It continued past a deli case piled with beef tongue and pastrami, past tiers of layer cakes, loaves of seeded rye, heaps of chopped liver and smoked-whitefish salad, and finally a stunning pastry case brimming with rugelach and little black-and-white cookies the size of silver dollars.

The line turned and hit the door, spilling the day's lunch crowd onto the well-manicured sidewalks of Mercato in North Naples.

I'd been craving a bowl of matzo ball soup. It came with a 40-minute wait, and some new TooJay's-line friends.

And I'm not even that mad.

The glaring lack of Jewish and Kosher delis in this area is crazy to me.

Meshuggeneh.

Collier County has a couple of Larry's Lunchbox Delicatessens, and Lee has, well, bupkes (pardon my Yiddish).

Enter TooJay's. Born in Palm Beach in 1981, the chain opened its first Southwest Florida location March 2. It replaced one of our only other Jewish-style delis, Stage Deli, which closed in July 2017 after almost eight years in Mercato.

Whereas Stage was more of a restaurant, TooJay's is more of a diner. That line that forms behind the host stand is first-come-first-serve. Signs on the walls try to tell you how long you'll be waiting. The one by the door says, ""10-12 min. wait from this point."" It lies. Try 30 to 40 minutes on an oddly busy weekday when everyone and their bubbe seems to be lingering over fat wedges of cheesecake and the last dregs of liverwurst.

TooJay's matzo ball soup glistened with chicken fat in a rich, cloudy stock. The matzo balls themselves were tender and wonderful, flecked with herbs for even more depth.

There was a buttery knish filled with creamy mashed potatoes, crisp latkes teamed with sour cream and apple sauce (such a delicious tradition), and chopped liver laced with wondrous bits of schmaltz that made me wonder how ""chopped liver"" could ever be used in vain.

TooJay's seeded rye is everything a good seeded rye should be, fluffy-soft with a light crust and just the slightest, most beautifully sour note of rye-funk whispering in the background.

That rye could be piled high with rolls of pastrami, corned beef or brisket. There's nothing wrong with any of it, but TooJay's slices its meats a bit too thin for me. I'd prefer more heft, more juiciness.

The brisket entree proved most disappointing. It featured that same sliced-too-thin brisket, wan and dry, atop latkes (these ones sadly mushy) and a mound of steamed broccoli. It tasted like a bad Sunday night, like something all the bubbes I know would wave away with upturned noses.

But just when things were looking down, an all-around more charming and far less weary server came along. She asked if I'd downloaded the TooJay's app, gave me a second to do so, then rewarded my button clicking with a free dessert. ""The Killer Cake lives up to its name,"" she said with a tilt of her head and a sly wink.

Unlike TooJay's wait-time signs, she was not lying.

That cake ate like a fudge-y dream, the kind of sticky thickness that sucks in your fork, and is best chased with a glass of milk or a steamy cup of coffee.

Geshmak.

I'm not saying TooJay's is perfect. I'd love to see a local, independent Jewish deli come to town. I'd love for it to blow TooJay's out of the water. But sometimes you've got to appreciate what you've got, and for now, TooJay's has the Kosher-style deli shtick just about cornered.

1110,Corkscrew volunteer honored for boardwalk art fundraiser after Hurricane Irma,"Pieces of broken boardwalk from Hurricane Irma were the creative groundwork for the new walkway at Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary.

Volunteer Leslie Burgess was recently honored for special service at the sanctuary's annual Volunteer Appreciation Dinner for her innovative way to foster rebuilding after Irma.

A few months after the powerful storm destroyed sections of the iconic boardwalk, Burgess saw a pile of discarded wood in a parking lot and asked to use some as a canvas for painting. She painted a colorful bunting, a common yellowthroat and a frog.

“It was my idea to do it as a donation because I hate to put a value on something that I paint,” she said.

Burgess displayed her pieces at Corkscrew where people could donate a minimum of $50 toward boardwalk restoration and receive a piece of the special art.

“So I painted 10-12 of them and they did sell,” she said.

Then she painted a lot more: 160 in total. She added paintings of anhingas, cormorants, owls, egrets, wood storks, roseate spoonbills, alligators, and herons. Each was detailed on pieces of the destroyed boardwalk that were cut into roughly 3½-by-4 inch blocks.

“The ones that would sell best would be owls and painted buntings,” Burgess said. “And the next thing that happened was we had a nest of anhingas right over the boardwalk and people took a lot of pictures of them so I did some of those. Frogs did pretty good, and then the wood storks showed up and I did wood storks.”

Burgess never expected her work to be in such demand. Her goal was to raise $3,000, but she later raised it to $5,000 when the painted pieces began selling well.

Owning a piece of the boardwalk was special for some visitors. Having a painting on it, made it even better. Her work is now sold out and it raised about $8,000.

“It’s really a tribute to how much satisfaction you can get out of volunteering,” she said. “I was surprised that it raised that much, but I think it’s good.”

Corkscrew volunteer coordinator Steve Parker said he was happy she came up with the idea.

“They went like hotcakes. They captured the essence of Corkscrew with the beautiful birds and animals. People snatched them up right away. It went to such a good cause. Our boardwalk is our signature item out there. That is how guests get out and see the beauty of Corkscrew. Through Leslie’s project we got funds to help make those repairs.”

When Hurricane Irma struck in September 2017, Burgess and her husband evacuated to Tennessee and later stayed with her family in Virginia. When she returned a month later she saw the devastation at Corkscrew.

“The boardwalk had major breaks,” she said. “By the short loop there was this one old tree that was called the Bee Tree because one hollow branch had a huge bee colony. The Bee Tree fell and it took out the boardwalk.""

Burgess also likes the message behind using the old boardwalk to fund the new one. She wanted to use the pieces just as they were, some with screw holes, some lichen, others with ragged edges.

Burgess, an Ohio native, began her career in art when she studied at University of Illinois where she received a degree in art education. She and her husband, who was in the Army, moved often as they raised their three children. They lived in Texas, Kansas, Kentucky, and Virginia just outside of Washington,D.C.

Twenty years ago, her husband’s job with Bonita Bay brought them to Southwest Florida. That’s when she decided to retire from her work as an artist and designer and volunteer instead.

“I moved here and saw something in the paper about volunteering, and I called up and they said, ‘Yes, come right away.'” Burgess described. “They were so welcoming. I knew nothing about wildlife. I knew cardinals and bluebirds and that’s it.""

Burgess was trained about the boardwalk and its wildlife. She volunteers as a boardwalk naturalist and occasionally leads tours for both adults and schoolchildren.

“People come because they see an article about it or they see something on TripAdvisor,” Burgess said. “And they come and think it is like a zoo and they walk out and say, ‘I don’t see anything.'

""So you want to show them something, and that is very rewarding. So you show them a snake on the ground or a frog on a tree, and sometimes you don’t find anything to show so you say, ‘Here are these trees. They have been here for 600 years.’ It is a challenge in a way.”

Most of all she loves using her artistic talent to help at the Sanctuary. She painted the luggage used to transport educational materials to and from local schools.

“I drew bugs coming out of the zippers,” she said.

She volunteers once a week for about six hours, doing her artwork and naturalist duties.

“Volunteering where you do what you want to do is fun, and what can be better than that?"" she said.

1111,North Port cracking down on illegal dumping,"- A lounge chair set up in Florida seems normal enough. But when it's just dumped in an empty lot in North Port, it's considered trash.

The city is dealing with illegal dumping.

""It doesn't do much for our property value,"" said Jackie Cordova.

Cordova lives in the southernmost part of North Port. She's fed up with illegal dumpers.

""Trash is free in Florida and you get two big pickups a year. You can put anything out there. Anything. But yet they bring it over here and dump it in our neighborhood,"" she said.

Continue reading below

Just minutes off I-75 and near the Sarasota County-Charlotte County line a wooded area seems well known to some.

""The sad part is if anyone threw down a match or anything, especially during the dry season. Everything would be gone,"" said Cordova.

The city of North Port decided it was time to clean up the undeveloped area. Within a couple of hours, they picked up 70 tires and 20 tons of bulk garbage.

""To use taxpayer resources for something that’s illegal and unnecessary can cause a strain,"" said Public Works Community Outreach Coordinator Michael Fear.

Fear said, even after a good clean up, more trash piles up.

""We've got yard waste right here. Some materials that looked like remodeling material,"" he said.

Fear believes construction and lawn workers don't want to pay a dumping fee so they come here.

""This is areas where it’s not developed where there’s not a lot of people out here. Because of that, it’s kind of a target for illegal dumping,"" he said.

The city of North Port and its police department is keeping an extra eye on the area. If you're caught dumping you'll pay a much bigger fine. Neighbors like Jackie ask people to keep that in mind.

""Please take care of our communities and don’t be a jerk. And throw stuff that you could put out for the trash in my neighborhood, put it in your own,"" she said.",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/north-port-cracking-down-on-illegal-dumping,2019-04-17T23:14:40Z,FOX 13 NEWS,Couple,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609

PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. -- The residents have spoken and Panama City Beach's Civil Service board will not change after Tuesday's election.

The city continues to stand alone as the only city in the state of Florida with a civil service board.

""I was pleased because I was on the side of due process and checks and balances,"" said Councilman Paul Casto.

Councilman Hector Solis said, ""what we were looking for was to go ahead and empower of department heads. To be able to go ahead and interview and hire staff that they need as quickly as possible.""

The change would've taken the hiring process responsibility away from the board, something Casto says has never been a problem.

""Most jobs you apply for, those people are used to having to wait a couple of weeks at least. Especially a government job. I don't know too many cities or counties or state government where you can walk in the door and get hired immediately,"" said Casto.

Solis says the decision is hindering the city from getting employees when they need it, ""the difference of waiting a month to get in front of a board versus being interviewed immediately by a department head. Our potential to lose people is great.""

One concern for residents was the loss of the grievance board but the according to the ballot, it wouldn't have impacted it.

Only 664 residents got out and voted and 464 voted against the change.

A successful high school and college softball playing career behind her, Alex Breeden had a decision to make.

The new college graduate ended up doing what she had always done, even if that wasn't apparent on the face of it.

Breeden made a move that maintained her role as builder.

The Viera High product had been a member of the second freshman class at the new high school just northwest of Melbourne. Then, she had been part of a University of South Alabama roster that took a young program to new heights, including first national ranking and first NCAA playoff appearance.

In 2018, her first season as Hawks softball head coach, she led the team to the state tournament for the first time in its history. This year, she's aiming to make that a regular pursuit for a program that had long knocked on the door but never before broken through.

CLOSE Breeden talks about influencing young athletes. Brian McCallum, FLORIDA TODAY

Viera athletic director Chris Gallagher said the attraction to the school's former catcher was her Hawks past, which meant familiarity with the school and team, and other qualifications that came through in a solid interview.

""Alex is driven and determined for success,"" Gallagher said. ""She really works hard at the fundamentals and gets the most out of every one of her players.""

Do not be deceived by Viera's 12-7 record. Every loss has come outside the area via a schedule designed ""to see the cream of the crop,"" in Breeden's words.

""Our goal has always been to peak at the end,"" she said. ""The way that I planned our schedule, the teams that I had us play, it's rough. It's tough. At the beginning, there were some bumps and bruises, but I think it's got us set up to peak at the right time.""

That time is coming. District tournament play begins April 29, and the team with five freshmen in the lineup has won four in a row. Viera has won all seven this year against Brevard opponents.

Her path to success is simple. The daughter of a former professional player and coach — Joe Breeden specialized in coaching catchers for pro baseball franchises — she is not one for shortcuts.

""I like work. I like hard work. I like knowing where we want to get and that it's possible if you work your butt off, no matter the talent level that's around you, and knowing there's a right way to do things and a wrong way.""

New head coaches: Former Viera assistant DeMarkulus Menyfield now leading Cocoa Beach football

Had the Viera head coaching position not come open, she isn't sure what she'd be doing now. The man she played for, Dale Pierce, not only made the Hawks relevant in the county but in the state. When Breeden made a visit to the school's website after college graduation, she found the job open.

She said coaching was ""always something in the back of my mind,"" and she thought she might someday do it at the collegiate level, but not at a high school.

""When I was finishing up at school in Alabama, I knew I wanted to come back here. Other than that, life was just kind of open to me. This opportunity, as well as being a teacher, kind of fell in my lap.""

She has embraced it, interested in the chance to forge the culture of the softball program and, beyond the diamond, to influence high school athletes in other areas of life.

""I want them all to grow into strong young women,"" Breeden said. ""It's the goal of holding them accountable and being accountable.""

Pierce said he knew Breeden would be a strong coaching candidate, in part thanks to her dad's influence, among other things.

""I remember she used to go to spring training with her dad, and she used to catch Major League pitchers. I kinda always thought she'd be headed into that coaching thing.""

CLOSE Breeden talks about coaching with her dad. Brian McCallum, FLORIDA TODAY

Although a 25-year-old coach perhaps has a better chance of communicating with high school athletes than some older coaches, her players know there is a line between friend and coach.

""She makes a pretty fine line whenever we step over that boundary,"" senior catcher Taylor Jensen said. ""She makes it clear we stepped over that line, and I know we all look up to her as a coach.""

Pierce said the potential was always there for Breeden to be the stern coach. He saw it behind the plate.

""She was very intimidating, probably one of the best catchers I've ever seen. Defensively, Alex was as good as I've ever seen,"" he said. And she could adapt. ""(Offensively,) If Alex got in trouble and didn't get a hit her first two times up, she was sure as heck gonna find a way to lay down a bunt and find a way to get on base.""

And despite her age and relative experience, she sounds like she's been coaching and teaching history for a decade or more, using some of the same big-picture phrases used by those more veteran.

""If, in 20 years, I'm still here, and we've got a couple of state championships under our belt, and … girls come back and say, 'Coach, I get it. I get why you were so hard on me,' that, to me, will be an amazing thing.""

That doesn't mean she's staying 20 years, but Breeden has goals, state championships and influencing her players included, even if all of it was a cross between fate and career accident.

""Just being young, I have a thousand things I want do. I hated having to make that life choice where I was down that road, down that path, but eventually I feel like like there are things in my life that are meant to be. It just kind of goes that way.""

1114,Now Open: Lucky's Market in North Naples kicks of with bacon cutting ceremony,"CLOSE Lucky's market President Chris Darling and Joseph Cummins, vice-president of new store operations open Lucky's Market in North Naples on Wednesday, April 17, 2019. Jon Austria, jaustria@gannett.com; 239-227-7803

The bacon has been cut and the doors to Lucky's Market in North Naples are now open.

Hundreds of shoppers flooded the new Lucky’s Market in the Promenade Shops at Naples Centre located on Naples Boulevard on Wednesday morning.

The new grocery store kicked off its grand opening with the cutting of a large slab of pork belly in place of the traditional yellow ribbon cutting ceremony.

“At Lucky’s Market we don’t cut ribbons to grand open our store, we cut bacon,” said Vice President of Operations Joseph Cummins.

Everyone in the store began to count down as the butcher prepared to slice the 14 to 18-pound slab of smoked pork belly with a large knife.

Employees with trays of freshly cooked bacon walked around offering free samples for shoppers to enjoy.

“We’re proud to be here and we hope to challenge your concept of what grocery store shopping can truly be,” said Lucky’s Market President, Chris Darling.

Lucky’s offers a “Sip & Stroll” program where customers can purchase a $2 pint of beer or $3 glass of wine or fresh-pressed juice, “Nitro” coffee or kombucha tea to enjoy while shopping.

The store also brings in live entertainment throughout the week to create a fun and unique atmosphere for shoppers.

“We don’t want to just be a place that you say, ‘I have to go get my groceries,’” Darling said. This should become a place, and we are going to strive to be a place, that you just want to come to and that there’s just a feeling and something great about just being here.”

John Barretti of Naples said he likes the fact that he can sip a cold beer while shopping.

“Grocery shopping isn’t my favorite thing to do, but if I can drink beer while doing it then count me in,” he said.

“It’s right in the neighborhood and I love the set up,” Lynn Stevens said as she filled her cart with fresh produce Wednesday morning.

The store also features a full apothecary department, which has been designed to deliver a unique experience with a bulk DIY wall where people can buy what they need to make their own teas, salves, tinctures, healing elixirs and more.

Founders of Lucky’s Market, Bo and Trish Sharon were not present for the grand opening but visited the new store days before.

The couple from Colorado, who are both chefs, founded the grocery store in 2003 and now have 35 stores in 11 states.

The North Naples location has nearly 150 employees, including an in-house butcher, chefs and employees who will hand out samples to shoppers as they walk around the store.

In addition to Lucky's drive to provide the best fresh food options to shoppers, the grocer also is dedicated to helping end world hunger by donating food they are not able to sell but is still edible to local food banks.

""Last year we donated more than one million pounds of food to individuals around the country,"" said regional marketing specialist at Lucky's, Samantha Greenberg.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

During the grand opening, a $7,500 Impact Grant was presented on behalf of Lucky’s Market to local organization, Youth Haven, to help purchase garden and kitchen supplies in support of their Community Garden Project and Life Skills HUB’s Cooking Seminars.

Lucky’s also is supporting the community by carrying out a fundraiser called Bags for Change through August 17, 2019 where shoppers reusing their shopping bags can choose to get a 10-cent credit on their purchase or to donate to their local non-profit organization of choice including: Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Sun Coast, Girls on the Run of Southwest Florida or Literacy Volunteers of Collier County.

The grand opening for the new Lucky’s in North Naples is the second location the store has opened in Naples and another location is expected to open by 2020 near Bonita Springs.

In January 2016, Lucky’s Market made its debut in Southwest Florida, opening in East Naples at 3815 U.S. 41 at the Naples Towne Centre.

The natural foods grocer has also signed leases for additional stores to open in the next few years in Fort Myers and Cape Coral.

1116,Lee County needs to keep hands off school tax money: your say,"0417 Cartoon (Photo: Jeff Koterba, Omaha World Herald, NE)

Keep promise

I/we are disappointed in Mr. Desjarlais' comments and proposal highlighted in a recent article regarding the ""shifting"" of funds resulting from the 0.5% school operating tax imposed for the express use for Lee County school maintenance, construction, and technology. Especially the comment and quote ""there is a way to do it"".

It seems as though this highlights the thinking of many of our elected officials and government employed leaders today; that is, the disregard of the clear intention of voters.

I/we would be much more positively impressed if our Lee County manager, county commissioners, and staff would focus on developing and communicating cost-saving initiatives instead of ""shifting"" funds from designated proposes that voters supported.

This was a close vote which many residents reluctantly supported; how these monies will be utilized will interesting and potentially influence future voter decisions. It is critical that the Lee County School Board insist that these monies be 100% utilized as promised and approved by Lee County voters. We are hopeful that the Lee County School Board is 100% opposed to this proposal and that the Lee County commissioners will support the funding as voted upon.

Shameless attempt

There’s an old saying – be careful what you wish for. Democrats were adamant that a special counsel should be appointed to investigate Trump even though there was no evidence of collusion with Russia.

They screamed for two years that Mueller should be protected so he could complete the investigation. Democrats and the media spent two years using a litany of speculation, innuendo and an orchestrated attempt to promote the conspiracy of collusion with Russia while depending on the investigation to confirm their wild claims.

Now that Mueller has confirmed unequivocally there was no collusion, neither the Democrats nor the media accept the findings and even claim that Mueller, the man they supported because of his impeccable reputation, is part of a cover-up. Never mind that he spent two years, employed 20 lawyers, 50 FBI agents, interviewed 500 witnesses, issued 2,800 subpoenas, contacted 13 foreign governments.

The Democrats and the media engaged in a shameless attempt to nullify the 2016 election and their embarrassing defeat with a phony investigation and now refuse to accept the impartial result. They are a party of obstruction, disruption and disinformation with a fetish for conspiracies and will stop at nothing to further an extreme left-wing agenda.

Medical errors

Great news regarding Mick’s successful surgery. A couple of mistakes in Dave Granlund’s cartoon published on April 10 in The News-Press.

1. The EKG machine is showing ventricular fibrillation, if so, Mick cannot be conscious to say ""Start me up!""

2. On the other hand, if above is true (he has ventricular fibrillation) than Mick is asking the correct treatment with defibrillator which in lay language would be ""start me up.""

Light stops

I understand that Cape Coral has approximately 400 bus stops that are not lighted. I looked up and found solar-powered LED street lights that can be purchased for under $300 each. Including $200 for a pole and installation, that would be $500 per light. I think that 200 of these can be installed and used until electricity is available to install permanent lights.

As permanent lights are installed, pick up the temporary LED lights and move them to a new location. This seems to me to fix half of the problem areas, and have a plan to correct the whole situation in the city. This could be done for a cost of about $100,000. Aren't our kids worth that much?

In World War II, there were 124,079 American POW(s), many who died while in captivity. Korean War, 7,245 American POW(s), (2,847 died in captivity); Vietnam War, 766 American POW(s) (114 died in captivity).

This man has the gall to insult over 132,000 captured prisoners.

Broadway Palm’s customers have been saying it for years: Give us something new, something fresh, something different.

Well, now they’re getting exactly that: A season packed with relatively recent hit musicals, including “Kinky Boots,” “Finding Neverland,” “Something Rotten” and “Once.”

“We’re definitely picking newer, contemporary, recent Broadway shows,” says Broadway Palm owner Will Prather. “We wanted to have an emphasis on new. … We’ve really been trying to listen to our audience.”

It’s a bold, risky move for the Fort Myers dinner theater, Prather admits. He could potentially alienate older audiences who’d rather see warhorses like the beloved 1959 musical “The Sound of Music” — the only show older than 20 years in Broadway Palm’s recently announced 2019-20 season.

Then again, younger people are the future of Broadway Palm. And Prather thinks his audiences are ready for the change.

“I think they’re going to trust us and be excited and enthused about it,” he says.

Broadway Palm’s new season is part of an adventurous 2019 for Prather. Chapter two of that adventure: His Fort Myers-based Prather Touring Company — part of the bigger Prather Productions, the Fort Myers-based company that includes Broadway Palm and The Dutch Apple Dinner Theatre in Lancaster, Pennsylvania — is heading overseas for the first time in its 11-year history.

The company’s “The Wizard of Oz” began touring the United States in 2017, including a stop last year at Mann Hall. Now it’s going on a four-month tour of China starting this August. That will be followed by a tour of the Middle East.

The Chinese tour starts at Foshan Grand Theater in Foshan, and then travels to Tianqiao Performing Arts Center in Beijing, Shanghai Daning Theater in Shanghai and several other Chinese cities. Then it goes to the Middle East for stops in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and more.

Prather says he’s excited about charting new territory.

“Taking our first show internationally to China is something I never imagined we would be doing,” he says. “The touring company has definitely grown over the past few years and has become the largest division of Prather Productions.

“It has opened up opportunities for us to produce new shows that would not normally be available to our dinner theatres.”

Prather Touring (also known as APEX Touring) often goes hand-in-hand with Broadway Palm and the Prather family's Dutch Apple Dinner Theatre. “Finding Neverland,” for example, plays Broadway Palm for six weeks and then goes on a 14-week national tour.

Then there’s another big experiment for Broadway Palm with “Once.” The intimate folk-rock romance plays six weeks at Broadway Palm, and then jumps to nearby Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall to do its technical work and prepare for a 20-week national tour. That includes a two-day run at Mann Hall.

Prather’s a big fan of the heartfelt musical, and his family knows the show’s producers and performers. He’s seen it four times already.

“It’s a show I’ve had my eye on for years,” he says. “It’s just a beautiful production.”

The show will be directed by J. Michael Zygo, a cast member from the original 2012 Broadway production. The tour also features sets and musical instruments from the original production, Prather says, including the famous working bar onstage.

Scott Saxon, general manager of Mann Hall, says he’s thrilled about working with Prather again. “It’s just a natural fit, I think.”

It also means audiences at Mann Hall and elsewhere in the United States will get a terrific show they might not otherwise see in 2019-20.

“I love the show,” Saxon says. “It’s a nice counterpoint to the usual spectacle (of Broadway). ... It shows the wide range of things that Broadway has to offer.

""It’s a small, intimate show, and it’s just so engaging.

1118,Naples brothers return to Haitian hometown to help send children to school,"Golden Gate High School teacher Fortinel Faustin still remembers his childhood in Mare-Rouge, Haiti. His family struggled to send him and his brother, Jhony, to school, but always made it work.

He recalls his parents would try to help other children get access to an education, just like them. In the Faustin house, an education was everything.

""Without an education, you won't even get a seat at the table,"" Jhony Faustin said.

A couple of years ago, Fortinel, 30, and Jhony, 28, returned home to Mare-Rouge, located about 100 miles northwest of Port-au-Prince, the country's capital.

Fortinel Faustin, 29, a social studies teacher at Golden Gate High School, is one of the creators of the nonprofit organization ""The Faustin Project."" Fortinel, along with his brother, Jhony, started a charity for children in Mare-Rouge, Haiti, where they grew up. The charity helps send kids to school and provides needed supplies.

The brothers had not seen Haiti in several years. In search of greater opportunity, their family moved to Southwest Florida in May 2002.

Both of them quickly realized how much ""hopelessness"" was in their birth country. Still recovering from Haiti's 2010 earthquake, the poverty level was very high and many children were not in school.

""We started to brainstorm ideas and ways that we could help,"" Fortinel said. ""We arrived at education because that's highly valued down there in Haiti.""

They decided to help Mare-Rouge children get their seat at the table by founding The Faustin Project in 2018.

The project

Named for their parents, Fortilus and Morilia Faustin, the brothers' project works to help provide scholarships for underprivileged children to attend school in Mare-Rouge.

""When I go there I have meetings with the kids and the parents,"" Fortinel said. ""I've had parents tell me how much it means to them.""

The project secured scholarships for 40 Mare-Rouge children to attend school by raising a couple of thousand dollars, but Jhony said they are just getting started.

The team hopes to provide more than 50 scholarships. The big goal is to open their own school in Mare-Rouge, which Jhony said would fill the greatest void.

""We're actually seeing the kids grow up before our eyes,"" Jhony said. ""The biggest change is watching kids go from being really shy to being really vocal and outgoing with us.""

The project started with selling T-shirts and soon developed to a nonprofit. The project is now partnered with the Rotary Club of Naples and the Enterprise Holdings Foundation.

In February, Golden Gate High School's athletic department donated more than 500 T-shirts to the project, according to their Facebook page.

Fortinel hopes it's just the beginning of the school's involvement. Some of his students have shown interest in aiding the project, which he said could help them develop their own causes.

""Going forward we are going to collaborate more with the students because they are very interested,"" Fortinel said.

Fortinel teaches social studies at Golden Gate High, where he encourages his students to get a world view of other places. He said Haiti is often labeled negatively without context.

In the United States, people don't have a full picture of what it's like in Haiti, who the Haitian people are and why local work is more essential than blind donations, he said.

""That first trip I gave people everything I had as far as money, but that's not a sustainable way of helping,"" Fortinel said.

Haitian roots

When they were students at Lely High School, Fortinel and Jhony dreamed of giving back to the Haitian schools where they got their early education, Fortinel said.

The brothers remember walking the school halls where many of their scholarship students now attend, Jhony said.

""We see both sides and we understand both sides,"" Jhony said. ""The connection we have to back home that's what makes it different from any other nonprofit over there in Haiti.""

Experiencing school in the United State and Haiti helps them understand the gap, he said.

""We grew up in that stuff, so we understand exactly what we need to do to help the community and help those kids for a better future,"" Jhony said.

In Haiti, people are fighting to feed their families, and paying for school is too often a financial burden, Fortinel said. They try to relieve it.

Every summer and any chance he gets throughout the year, Fortinel returns to Haiti. Jhony always follows.

Fortinel said it's hard to describe his experiences going back to Mare-Rouge. Sometimes he just acts on instinct. He recalled seeing a young boy with terrible burns down his back. His aunt, who primarily cared for him, could only afford to put powder on the burns.

Fortinel can still remember the boy's screams, which brought him to tears. The project helped provide him with medical care and now he's full recovered.

He said the Mare-Rouge community is responding positively to their future plans and work.

""They really appreciate what we're doing,"" Jhony said. ""They really support our vision down there.""

Mare-Rouge parents laud praises on the brothers for returning home.

""If this foundation grows, the kids will definitely benefit from more than just their school fees being paid,"" Fortinel said. ""They'll have a normal childhood.""

1119,"Rattlesnakes invade East Orange neighborhood, kill dogs","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - Neighbors in East Orange County's rural Wedgefield subdivision said rattlesnakes have killed two dogs.

Wedgefield, which borders Hal Scott Regional Preserve between State Roads 520 and 528, is made up of large lots next to heavily wooded areas.

Trapper Leo Cross with Florida Wildlife Trappers said the wooded areas are home to the Eastern Diamondback rattlesnake.

""The eastern diamondback, they live in this brush,"" Cross said. ""So when a track gets cleared, usually they have nowhere to go.""

Cross was at a home on Robertson Street last week and removed a five-and-a-half foot long rattlesnake from Lori Parsons' home.

""We first saw it about a month ago when it visited us on our patio and our dogs started barking at it,"" Parsons said. ""They (dogs) were barking and jumping back and the snake started coiling like it was going to attack them.""

Cross said Parsons was lucky her dogs did not get close enough to be bitten.

""The dog found it because it could sense it a lot better than a human would,"" Parsons said. ""Lucky they got their dog back before it struck at it, because there's already been a couple out here with the snakes bit people's dogs.""

Cross found the snake hiding under palmetto branches.

""That venom, especially to a pet, might be devastating,"" Cross said. ""To a human, you can call authorities, stay still, stay calm. Usually, if you can get the anti venom within two hours, you have a 99 percent chance of making it.""

He put the snake in a bag and took it to a serpentarium in St. Cloud where it was milked for its venom to create antivenin, Cross said.

Cross said he visits Wedgefield several times a week for venomous snakes and has removed dozens of rattlesnakes, water moccasins and even a coral snake.

Parsons hoped it would be the last but has since realized there will likely be more.

""I wanted to think it was the only one and by trapping it, it was OK,"" Parsons said. ""I've since gone on to the Wedgefield Facebook page and there's a number of snakes.""

Neighbors posted concerns about their pets and asked for help removing and even tagging the snakes. Some asked about antivenin.

Cross said hospitals and some fire stations stock antivenin but the snakes will continue to invade yards as long as their habitat is destroyed with the continued construction and clearing of land.

""Tracks (of land) will be cleared at some point, you're probably going to see more snakes move out of here,"" Cross said.

Parsons is active in the Audubon Society and invited those curious about snakes to an informational presentation on Thursday.

1120,Trial begins Tuesday for man accused of killing shoplifter,"- The trial for a man accused of killing a suspected shoplifter begins Tuesday in Orange County.

Lonnie Leonard was charged with manslaughter back in April 2017.

Deputies said he shot and killed 19-year-old Arthur Adams outside of a Walmart in Pine Hills.

They said the victim and two others were stealing two cartloads worth of stuff - including diapers - from the store and when Leonard saw store employees try to stop them, he jumped in and shot at them.

Deputies say Adams and the others drove off in a stolen car and then crashed. Adams died later at the hospital.

Leonard was charged with manslaughter a couple months later.

Since then, he and his family have maintained that Leonard is a good guy and that he was just trying to stop a few thieves and thought he was doing the right thing.

Leonard wrote letters to the judge a few months back and was offered a plea deal last week but refused it, according to court records.

Now, he said he wants to appear in court in his jail jumpsuit rather than getting dressed up.

The trial gets underway Tuesday.

1121,Judge allows hospital video of Austin Harrouff in connection with 'face-biting' deaths,"Austin Harrouff, who is accused of murdering Jupiter couple John Stevens III and Michelle Mischon, attended a hearing related to his case Friday, Sept. 29, 2017, at the Martin County Courthouse in Stuart. From his hospital room before his arrest in 2016, Harrouff gave an interview to Phillip McGraw of the ""Dr. Phil"" show discussing the crime and his mental state. Friday's hearing related to the episode, with prosecutors requesting copies of unaired footage. (Photo: LEAH VOSS/TCPALM)

MARTIN COUNTY— A judge allowed a video of Austin Harrouff ""fighting against his restraints"" while he was being treated at St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach in 2016 into evidence on Monday.

According to a motion filed by Harrouff's attorneys, the video shows the ""mental status"" of Harrouff two days after he was accused of killing a Martin County couple.

In February 2017, Harrouff's attorneys hired Dr. Phillip Resnick, a forensic psychiatrist at the University Hospitals of Cleveland in Ohio, who wrote in a document summarizing his findings that the 22-year-old suffered from a severe mental disease that caused him to not know his actions were wrong when he killed John Stevens III, 59, and Michelle Mishcon, 53, at their Southeast Kokomo Lane home in Martin County.

Harrouff faces two counts of first-degree murder with a weapon for the deaths of Mishcon and Stevens; one charge of burglary of a dwelling with assault or battery while armed for breaking into their garage; and one charge of attempted first-degree murder with a weapon for attacking and injuring the couple's neighbor, Jeffrey Fisher.

Harrouff, a Jupiter resident who was attending Florida State University, was found biting and chewing on Stevens' face in the couple's driveway on Aug. 15 2016. Detectives recovered what appeared to be flesh from Harrouff's teeth.

""The fact that Mr. Harrouff persisted in biting the male victim in the presence of police officers, in spite of being shot, being Tased and receiving multiple kicks to the heads, suggests that Mr. Harrouff was actively psychotic,"" Resnick wrote in a mental health report on Harrouff.

The motion filed April 5, also references an email from a Martin County deputy that said ""The nurse added a normal person should never wake up with the amount of sedation he is on. The nurse said they may have to give him meds to completely paralyze him, because when he wakes up his heart rate drops.""

Judge Sherwood Bauer Jr. agreed to allow the the 1 minute and 14 second video into evidence as long as the faces of hospital staff were blurred when the video was presented in court.

1123,Florida State's slide continues with extra innings loss to Jacksonville,"Florida State’s struggles on the diamond continued Tuesday.

The Seminoles (18-10, 6-6 ACC) fell 3-2 to Jacksonville (19-10, 5-1 ASUN) in 11 innings in front of 4,284 fans at Dick Howser stadium.

The Seminoles have lost four of their last five games and nine of their last 14. They started out the season 12-0. It’s the fourth straight week FSU has dropped a mid-week game.

""This is something that... we haven't had to go through many times here at Florida State,"" FSU coach Mike Martin said.

""In all the years I've been here I've experienced losing five or six in a row... It's called life. And there's another saying that we have here with our baseball program. 'Shut up and play.' And that's what we intend to do.""

FSU was outhit by the Dolphins 10-5 after being outhit 40-18 over the weekend by Boston College.

The Seminoles’ only runs came off a two-run home run by shortstop Mike Salvatore in the fifth inning. They struck out 13 times and left nine runners on base.

""It looked like one of those games in which we were pressing,"" Martin said.

""Trying to do things instead of letting the game come to us. Thirteen strikeouts in 11 innings. That's not making the other team play with the baseball. They didn't make an error.""

FSU has now scored four runs or less in six of the last seven games.

Right-hander Conor Grady (4-3) picked up the loss after allowing a run in the 11th inning. Nick Love (2-0) picked up the win for JU.

FSU and JU will meet one more time this season on May 7.

Changes

Martin promised changes following the Seminoles' 8-0 loss to Boston College Sunday, but the only significant change was a position swap with Salvatore and Nander De Sedas.

Salvatore moved from second to shortstop -- he started all 62 games at short in 2018 -- and De Sedas moved to second.

""I'm happy with the flipping of the shortstop and the second baseman,"" Martin said.

De Sedas dropped a pop-up for the only error of the game. It was his team-leading seventh error of the season.

The Seminoles also switched around the batting lineup, but that's been the case all season as they look to find the order that works best.

On the Mound

J.C. Flowers made the first pitching start of his career against the Dolphins. He threw three scoreless innings with three strikeouts, one walk, and one hit. He has yet to give up a run this season in 11.2 innings of work.

He was replaced by right-hander Tyler Ahearn, who threw a scoreless fourth inning before giving way to left-hander Jonah Scolaro.

Scolaro lasted 1.1 innings before loading the bases in the top of the sixth. He was pulled in favor of right-hander Chase Haney, who allowed one run to score.

Left-hander Antonio Velez came in for the seventh and eighth innings. He gave up the tying run on back-to-back doubles in the eighth.

Right-hander Conor Grady threw two scoreless innings in the ninth and 10th to give the Seminoles a chance to win. Grady came back out to pitch the 11th and JU took advantage with a double and a single to plate the winning run.

Player of the Game

Salvatore played very well defensively a shortstop. He had five assists with no errors and made a couple of impressive ranging stops.

Offensively, it was Salvatore's two-run home run off the scoreboard in left in the bottom of the fifth that gave the Seminoles the first lead. It was his fourth home run of the season.

Scoring Recap

Salvatore put FSU up 2-0 with the two-run shot to left field.

First baseman Jacob Southern got JU on the board with an RBI-single to left field in the sixth cut the FSU lead to 2-1. Southern tied the game 2-2 in the eighth inning with an RBI-double to left.

JU right fielder Cory Garrastazu hit a single through the right side that went just off second baseman Nander De Sedas' glove to give the Dolphins a 3-2 lead in the 11th inning.

Up Next

FSU will hit the road to take on Miami in Coral Gables, Fla. Friday at 7 p.m. The game will be available online at ESPN3 and on the radio at 106.1 FM in Tallahassee.

1124,The meteor that buzzed North Florida likely came from asteroid belt and may never be found,"CLOSE Meteor lights up Tallahassee's sky Courtesy of Dan Taylor, Tallahassee Democrat

The meteor that cast an eerie green light over north Florida and south Georgia on Saturday night likely broke up into pieces too small and too remote to ever be found.

Peter Hoeflich, an astrophysics professor at Florida State University, said it’s not rare for meteors and other materials from space to hit earth — some 25 tons of the stuff crash on the planet every day. But he said it was unusual for so many people to see such a dramatic display, which often happens over unpopulated areas.

“It’s a spectacular event because we observed it,” Hoeflich said. “But a lot of these things go unnoticed. It’s rare to really catch it.”

The National Weather Service in Tallahassee observed the meteor on its satellite system and heard preliminary reports that it landed near Perry.

While tracking rain over Mississippi and Alabama, a trace of a meteor streaking across the sky was picked up by the National Weather Service's GOES satellite. (Photo: NWS Tallahassee)

Hoeflich said the space rock may have come from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It was likely no more than an inch or so in diameter and broke up as it hit the atmosphere.

“Some of the parts may have reached the ground,” he said. “But how do you find that when it’s such a small piece?”

The meteor dazzled people who happened to catch it just before midnight. They posted cell phone videos, complete with expletives, on social media.

Federico Di Catarina, a meteorologist with the Weather Service, was driving east on Tennessee Street with a couple of friends when the meteor lit up the sky. He said the sky lit up, then the glowing ball came down, getting brighter and brighter until it disappeared at the horizon.

“Everyone was amazed,” he said. “They all just pointed at me and said, ‘What was that?’""

Ken Kopczynski, president of the Tallahassee Astronomical Society, was out stargazing with the group at Lake Miccosukee on Saturday night. He left early and missed the meteor, but some of his colleagues caught a glimpse of it.

He said he knows of no effort underway to try to find pieces of the meteorite, if in fact they landed somewhere in north Florida.

“Can you imagine how many square miles of pine trees there are out there in Perry?” Kopczynski asked. “Unless it landed in someone’s lap, it’d be kind of hard to find.”

1129,UFO community still believes — and science is starting to listen,"ORLANDO — He appeared as if a hologram at first — then solid — suddenly there and clear as you or I, at the edge of the forest behind Trish Bishop's home in Kissimmee.

It was a Thursday in March 2013, the glow of the afternoon tucking in for the day behind the trees. He stood tall, at least 6-foot-3, perhaps 220 pounds and certainly muscular, wearing a formfitting tan colored uniform, boots and gloves. He lingered by the crape myrtle tree in the middle of the backyard.

When he turned around, it was his face, she remembers, that stopped her.

Bulging eyes jutting so far out of the sockets that Bishop wondered whether he could close them. Skin white as chalk. And a jaw so large, it dispelled any notions the government worker had of the visitor being human.

""If you compare a human jawbone to his, we would be a Chihuahua to a pit bull,"" Bishop said.

Paralyzed with fear, she watched as what she believed to be an alien appeared to climb invisible steps, stopping often to snatch glances at her from where she sat on her back porch, fumbling with her phone to appear as though she couldn't see him.

Her finger was pressed on the number ""9"" to dial for help.

When he was about 10 feet off the ground, he turned his back to her and pulled himself up — ""into a UFO?"" she thought — and was gone.

Bishop sat stunned. ""I've got a freaking alien in my backyard,"" she thought.

It would be four years before she told anyone her story, before she'd discover the Mutual Unidentified Flying Objects Network, a nationwide organization 50 years old, and file her report under case number 84886 with the local Florida chapter.

But she worried: Who would believe her?

These days, more people than you'd think.

Across restaurants and meeting rooms in the United States, MUFON groups still gather every month to discuss cases like Bishop's with the enthusiasm that once gripped the nation during the Cold War, when UFO sightings still made a splash on the front page.

The Space Coast group, made up of some former NASA employees and engineers, has 118 members, the largest in the state. Across the U.S. they number 3,500, with additional offices in 42 countries.

For many years, they were alone entertaining UFO theories. No more.

In the past two years, scientists, politicians and professionals have increasingly been willing to touch the taboo subject and perhaps lend a little credence to those who still believe.

In December 2017, The New York Times uncovered that the U.S. had gone so far as to fund a secret, $22 million, five-year project to study UFO claims.

Since then, respected researchers, from the chairman of Harvard University's astronomy department to at least one scientist at NASA, have come out with theories, albeit controversial ones, that suggest closer study of the role extraterrestrials may play in certain phenomena.

What's changed, said Robert Powell, an executive board member on the nonprofit Scientific Coalition for Ufology, is our understanding of the universe. As scientists have discovered more Earth-like exoplanets and begun to delve into the options for interstellar travel — one idea includes using a laser-propelled, microchip-shaped probe — the conversation has been shifting.

""We still think of ourselves, as a species, as the center of everything,"" Powell said. ""Once you ... at least start to discuss interstellar travel, you have to admit that, if there is intelligent life out there, then they have to be able to travel interstellar, too.""

***

The challenge with UFO and alien sightings has always been the lack of evidence. Bishop said she was too scared to take a photo of her alien. Little to no consequential evidence exists in other cases.

Psychology can explain some of it. Common explanations include a person projecting their unconscious desires onto something, or a predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories informing what a person thinks they saw, said Alvin Wang, a psychology professor at the University of Central Florida.

People who believe they witnessed something may seek out others who reaffirm that belief, like ""being in an echo chamber,"" Wang said.

""People tend to hold on to that particularly if it fits in with their worldview and their belief system that there are other beings that inhabit the universe,"" Wang said. ""And they get ... confirmation support, when they are members of UFO believers community.""

But Bishop stands by what she said she saw. She works a government security job with three area contractors and said she has no reason to lie.

And she's on the hunt for ET now. After reporting her case in 2017, she bought three hunting trackers on eBay and set them up in her backyard. They're motion activated, and sometimes they'll go off in the night and capture 6,000 images — but there's nothing in the frame. She once caught a Tic Tac-shaped blur in the sky she believes to be a UFO.

""I just think it's a belief thing until you actually see them,"" Bishop said. ""You always gotta wonder.""

Some people, like Kathleen Marden, have been wondering all their lives.

It was September 1961 when the then 13-year-old got the call: Her aunt, Betty Hill, and her uncle, Barney Hill, said they'd seen a UFO on their drive through the White Mountains in New Hampshire.

Betty's dress was torn and Barney's shoes were scuffed. There were two hours they couldn't account for and Barney was sure he'd seen eight to 11 figures dressed in black shiny uniforms that were ""somehow not human,"" said Marden, who now lives outside Orlando.

It wasn't until the Hills were put through a hypnosis session by Boston psychiatrist Dr. Benjamin Simon that their stories of being taken into a UFO and physically examined were revealed.

""They were interested in the skin, in the skeletal structure, in the joints,"" said Marden, MUFON's director of experiencer research. ""They examined their hands, they took their shoes off, they examined their feet, they did tests on them that appear to be testing their nervous systems, as well.""

The Hills' alleged abduction was made public in 1965 — and the story gripped the nation. ""Did They Seize Couple?"" the Boston Traveler posited. ""I Was Quizzed in 'Space Ship,'"" read another headline.

Marden has dedicated her life to uncovering the truth behind she says was government tampering with the Hills' case and has written four books about her aunt and uncle and flying saucers. She's seen the change in perception about UFOs in the public and scientific community first hand.

""I absolutely do think that there is a shift, that people are giving more credence to this they did in the past,"" she said, pointing to the 2017 New York Times story on the Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program as the turning point.

The program was run by military intelligence official Luis Elizondo and put together at the request of then-Senate majority leader Harry Reid. It ran from 2007 to 2012 in partnership with businessman Robert Bigelow's company Bigelow Aerospace, which studied cases of American military personnel observing unknown objects.

One case in particular garnered attention when it was declassified because videos showed a craft with no apparent propulsion moving at alarmingly fast speeds. It was filmed in 2004 by two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets off the coast of San Diego.

Navy pilot Commander David Fravor, who witnessed the Tic Tac-shaped craft, told The Washington Post in late 2017 that he maintained it was ""something not from Earth.""

Then came Harvard's astronomy department chair, Avi Loeb, a renown scientist who Time magazine named one of the 25 most influential people in space in 2012.

He, along with colleague Shmuel Bialy, wrote in a publication in Astrophysical Journal Letters that a thin interstellar object seen passing through our solar system called Oumuamua ""is a lightsail, flowing in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment.""

Loeb went a step further, theorizing that, ""alternatively, a more exotic scenario is that Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization."" The theory has provoked the ire of the scientific community, but Loeb has stood by it.

Is it aliens, for sure? Loeb can't say. He just says he can't find another explanation.

At NASA Ames Research Center in California, scientist Silvano Colombano has gone on record suggesting the space agency look at all explanations in its approach to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, known as SETI. Historically, NASA has not weighed in on the issue much, most recently opening a Center for Life Detection Science that is more about finding biosignatures than analyzing alleged UFO sightings.

But Colombano argued in a March 2018 white paper that the scientific community should be more open about looking at the evidence that is already there, ""consider the UFO phenomenon worthy of study"" and engage in ""speculative physics"" grounded in solid scientific theories but with some ""willingness to stretch possibilities as to the nature of space-time and energy.""

Essentially, he said, it was time NASA had a more open mind.

***

While science dukes it out, the members of the MUFON's Space Coast chapter take their places at their monthly meeting in the back room of an old-fashioned BBQ joint in Palm Bay called Memaw's to discuss what they all believe to be a universal truth.

Many believers come to the meetings because someone they know saw something they couldn't explain, or because they've nursed an interest in the subject since the days of the Cold War, when UFO sightings and abduction claims spiked. Some say they have seen things. Others put stock in more eccentric theories.

They are what's left of a movement that once captured the interest of thousands, inspired books like Carl Sagan's ""Contact,"" long-running TV show ""The X-Files,"" and made Betty and Barney Hill the stars of a 1975 film starring James Earl Jones.

There are many people like Barbara Stusse, who says her mother saw a UFO in 1947 and kept it from her children for 30 years. Stusse remembers waiting for her copy of the Boston Herald every day for a week in 1965, when the Hills' story unraveled in three to four pages of newsprint a day.

""I read that and I thought, 'I believed it,' "" said Stusse, 80, who has been coming to MUFON meetings for three years.

And there's Bill Fisk, who is always at meetings taking notes. He's in charge of taking in reported sightings like Bishop's and trying to explain them. Could weather have played a role? Could the person have dreamed it?

Fisk, who has been hooked since the moment he saw a light in the sky make a sharp 90-degree turn when he was 9 years old, joined the local MUFON chapter in 2015.

He went all in, taking 100 hours of online classes over three months to get certified as a field investigator for MUFON. He learned how to read flight plans, how to measure longitude, latitude and cloud altitude, how to use a Geiger counter to measure ionizing radiation.

Sometimes he gets hoaxes. One man copyrighted an image he took of the sky through a window because he was convinced it was a UFO. Turns out, it was just the reflection of his hotel room's ceiling light on the glass. Chinese lanterns in the sky are often confused with flying saucers. And one woman even claimed an alien came into her house and had sex with her.

""A lot of it is that people don't look up, they don't pay attention to the sky, the last time they read a science book was in 12th grade,"" Fisk said. ""It's just one of those things that sometimes you just have to bring them along, give them the information, the education to do something with what they saw, put it into a framework.""

A customer solutions representative for CareerSource Brevard, Fisk works on cases at lunch or after work. He can close most in three to four days, write them off as someone thinking Venus was a UFO, but sometimes he gets one he can't crack.

It joins the small percentage of true ""unknowns"" that can't be explained by weather phenomena or other means. That possibility keeps him and his colleagues going, always considering each case, always looking up to the sky.

""I would like to see people accept the fact that there are things they can't explain,"" Fisk said. "" ... I'm not going to stop doing it. (I'll keep adding) to the database because that's all I can do.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190420/ufo-community-still-believes---and-science-is-starting-to-listen?rssfeed=true,2019-04-20T15:57:27Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

WACISSA — The yesterday, today and tomorrow bush in Carole McMullen’s front yard along Tram Road is in full bloom with fragrant little lavender blossoms. A spring breeze blows through the trees, the sound only interrupted by the periodic whizzing by of a pick-up truck.

The strip of grass between the sparsely traveled road and her fence is dotted with little white signs: “Say no to transmission lines.""

A year or so from now, less than 10 feet away from her front door, a nine-story-tall concrete pole could be driven into the sandy soil. Every 500 feet or so, there’d be another one. In both directions, 90 miles each way.

Buy Photo Carole McMullen, a concerned Wacissa homeowner, stands in front of her home with one of the many ""Say No To Transmission Power Line"" signs that line her yard. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

The serene sounds surrounding McMullen’s house would be replaced by the hum of 161 kilovolt lines carrying power over her head from a Florida Power and Light substation near Lake City to a Gulf Power substation west of Tallahassee.

McMullen’s is one of hundreds of houses that sit in the proposed 176-mile path of high-power electric transmission lines planned to run through – but not to – seven rural north Florida counties, including Gadsden, Jefferson and Leon.

Construction on the $350 to $380 million project by NextEra Energy, which acquired Gulf Power in January and owns FPL, is slated to begin in early 2020. The siting of the lines did not require approval by Florida Public Service Commission because the planned voltage falls below regulatory limits.

Local governments have little jurisdiction over private utility transmission lines built private utility companies, which have the power to condemn and take land if they can prove a public purpose.

McMullen and other shocked and dismayed area property owners never had a chance to object to what they say will ruin their property values and most importantly their quality of life. They didn’t know about the project until February, when power company contractors came to their doors looking to buy their land.

What they’ve learned since then is there’s likely nothing they can do now to stop it.

“We’d planned to live here forever. Country living. You want to move out in the country and we did. Now they’re going to put these monstrosities in,” said McMullen, who moved to the area about five years ago for the peace of living miles away from the nearest town.

“They had this in the works for a long time,” she said. “It’s not right.”

'Investment' may impact almost 850 properties

Gulf Power’s website calls the new transmission line an “investment to enhance electric reliability and resiliency and properly plan for anticipated growth in North Florida.” Company spokesman Gordon Paulus said the final route for the line has not been set.

But maps submitted to the state Division of Historical Resources as part of a required pre-construction cultural survey indicate its general corridor.

The line would connect Florida Power’s Raven Substation in Columbia County to Gulf Power’s Sinai Cemetery Substation in Jackson County. Beyond meeting future energy needs, company officials say the project is needed to strengthen the power grid to reduce outages during major storms and hurricanes.

The line is envisioned going north from the substation near Lake City to Interstate 10. It would run west to Waukeena Highway in Jefferson County then to Tram Road in Wacissa and into Leon County. It would go south around Tallahassee along Capital Circle Southwest to the Arvah B. Hopkins Generating Station on Geddie Road. The proposed line then would cut through the Apalachicola National Forest north to Midway and again to I-10 on to Jackson County.

Paulus maintained the route is still being finalized but consideration was being given to paths already in place. He reiterated the project’s goal of utility resiliency and said the company has tried to communicate with impacted residents.

“To minimize the impact to property owners, much of the proposed route is along existing roads, highways and existing transmission line rights-of-way,” he wrote in an email.

“Projected outreach efforts began in January shortly after NextEra Energy Inc. purchased Gulf Power,” he continued. “We have met with several residents and will continue to meet with others and gather feedback as the project progresses.”

Documents obtained by the Tallahassee Democrat show that plans to “accelerate surveying and mapping services” for the project were already underway in December.

A Dec. 12 letter from land acquisition contractor Dewberry Engineers to FPL senior project manager Daniel Hronec described early preparations of easement sketches so negotiations with property owners could begin along 87 miles of the proposed project.

The letter from Dewberry’s Associate Vice President William Donley detailed the number of private land parcels, government land and street crossings in Madison, Jefferson and Leon counties. In those three counties, the letter indicated 440 private land parcels that may need to be acquired and 59 intersection crossings.

“It is our understanding that FPL desires to perform advanced acquisition of easements required for the construction of this transmission line with an expected service date of 2020,” Donley wrote. “Early preparations of sketch and legal descriptions for use in the negotiations with the respective parcel owners will be paramount in meeting this objective.”

Tallahassee attorney Mike Tomkiewicz is working with homeowners from Suwanee County to Gadsden County who have been approached by power company representatives about purchasing easements. So far, about 40 have hired his firm, GrayRobinson, to help navigate the process and ensure their properties aren’t undervalued. About 850 properties overall could be impacted.

It has been difficult to get details from NextEra about the project, when it started or where the line is going, he said. Large-scale projects by private power companies are generally done behind closed doors, offering little chance for residents to have input or even know about them until they are underway.

“It’s not like DOT or Leon County or some other public entity where every stage of the project development is known,” Tomkiewicz said. “Power line projects are extremely different because they’re very secretive.”

Most people his firm has talked to about the project oppose it, but they likely will be stuck with it.

“They don’t want it. They want to stop it and that’s the most difficult spot,” Tomkiewicz said. “It’s unlikely they’ll be able to stop it.”

If enough homeowners along the proposed path decline to sell their property easements, NextEra can enact the state’s eminent domain statute.

The company could argue in court the line serves a public purpose, there is a legal necessity to acquire the property because homeowners are not willing to give it up and owners were offered full compensation for the land, Tomkeiwicz said.

Those three things satisfy requirements for eminent domain.

“If they say no, what they (NextEra) do is they have an appraiser come out then they’ll make a formal offer,” he said. “Once they do that, if they still say no, they’ll file a lawsuit and physically take the property using the power of eminent domain. They have the power of condemnation.”

'Like a stranger passing through wreaking havoc'

Josh Goodwin’s 100-year-old house near “downtown” Wacissa is right in the path of the project. The new transmission lines would be about 44 paces from his family’s shady front porch. He is among those contacted by Gulf Power representatives about giving up land.

“We don’t know how this actually going to affect folks,” Goodwin said. “To have this happen is like a punch in the gut. The shoe is dropping, and nobody was warned or has any influence on it.”

The Goodwins bought their house and moved from Tallahassee a year ago. They were charmed by the tiny town, which doesn’t have a single stoplight and sits just a mile from the headwaters of the Wacissa River.

The place has history. A small store once stood in their side yard as did a post office. Every time he digs a hole, Goodwin finds relics, an old horse shoe or turn-of-the-century glass bottle. The house is marked in red on a cultural survey conducted by archaeologists hired by NextEra Energy as being a physical barrier to construction. It’s also on the state historic registry.

“We thought it’d be nice to be part of a smaller community where we could make an impact if we wanted to … to raise a family,” he said. “We moved out here because it’s beautiful, for the natural environment and the history. Then come to find out we're going to be under high-voltage power lines. It’s what keeps you up at night.”

His wife Jill also is concerned about the potential to damage the nearby fragile ecosystem, which is distinguished by springs and spring-fed rivers.

""We're about a mile from (Wacissa) spring so digging 17 feet down (to put in poles), how does that even work with sinkholes?"" she said. ""You’re going right into the water table.""

If not for a Facebook group formed after the power company’s surveying and land service contractors started knocking on doors, the Goodwins said they might still be in the dark. The couple has been among other concerned property owners from both Jefferson and Leon counties who’ve been meeting at Catherine DeLoney’s house.

DeLoney has helped to organize residents and was one of the first to alert local officials to the transmission line project. She’s worried about the speed of the project, NextEra’s lack of transparency and its seeming disinterest in local input.

“It would have been nice to have thought we could have had some input in this but that’s not the way Florida Power works,” DeLoney said. “Our concerns are valid. The sinkholes are reality. The destruction of the tree line is going to be a reality and our neighbors across the street are going to lose their buffer.”

Buy Photo Jill Goodwin talks about why she and her husband decided to move to the area and how the transmission lines being put in along the road would affect them. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

DeLoney has twice written Gov. Ron DeSantis hoping to see the project paused until more input can be gathered.

“Please don’t let them turn this area from a beautiful part of natural Florida into an ugly industrial roadway,” she wrote. ""These lines will ruin what the state has worked to preserve for green space.""

She was referred to the Department of Environmental Protection and told DeSantis' office had no authority over the project.

Adding insult to injury, those with the lines towering overhead won’t get a kilowatt of power from them, said Ray Brown, a retiree who has lived in eastern Leon County for the past 17 years.

He too learned of the project back in February when a power company representative showed up at his door, only telling him they were considering the project. He stands to lose the wooded boundary between his property and Tram Road. The canopy road he loves driving on to and from town would become “an eyesore.”

“I hate to have to sit on my porch and have to look at these concrete poles in my front yard,” said Brown. “I could understand if it was a necessity to have a power source, but we’ve already got a power source here in Leon County.

“This is like a stranger passing through wreaking havoc. Now they come in like a strong hand and say we’re going to take what you have because we want it. That’s not right.”

1134,Earth Day and Easter events can keep your family busy this weekend | Family Fun,"CLOSE Children hunt for Easter eggs Saturday in Tallahassee at Astoria Elementary School. Ashley White/Democrat

We had family in town this weekend, and we decided to go to Lake Ella for Food Truck Thursday for dinner. It was a gorgeous night to be outside (and nice to have one less meal to think about for our company). We brought chairs and a blanket and set up camp a little ways back from the stage.

The Frank Jones Band was performing, and they were great. The music was the perfect volume to enjoy and still be able to chat.

There were five food trucks there, and after dinner we went into Barb’s Gourmet Brittles for homemade brittle ice cream. Barb also had some homemade fruit pops that we can’t wait to try next time. Some of the shops stay open later on Thursday nights, and I ran into Quarter Moon while the girls went for a walk around the lake with my mom. We had a great time and will be back.

Details: Every Thursday from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. Dogs are welcome but must be on a leash. No outside food but drinks in coolers are OK. Restrooms are available in the open shops.

1135,State of Sunshine Brewing hopes to open brewery on Treasure Coast,"Baby sea turtles hatching on the beach and making their way to the ocean was a sign to open a brewery.

The last time we heard from Johnathan Billings, who’s been an Indian River County lifeguard since 1995, he won Viceland’s TV homebrewing competition, “Beerland,” in early 2018 with the Man-Go-War beer as part of Red Buoy Brewers.

But he left the Sebastian-based homebrewing club in August. Billings wanted to ride the wave of popularity to open a brewery, he said, but the others didn’t feel the same.

They split, and each member took whatever recipe he created. For Billings, that included Man-Go-War.

More: Sebastian lifeguards win TV homebrewing competition 'Beerland' with Man-Go-War beer

He was sitting on the beach at Mulligan’s the night before Shore lb.’s annual Skim Jam competition and talking to his friends Chris Ellison and Casey Johnson about what happened.

Ellison, who owns clothing company Shore lb., wondered if they should do a brewery.

“All of a sudden, all these sea turtles started coming out of their nest,” Billings said. “If this isn’t a sign, then I don’t know what is.”

They then added his friend, Devin Giles, a member of the Boil Over Boys homebrewing club in Sebastian and brewer at Sailfish Brewing Company in Fort Pierce.

“We have some really good brewers (on the Treasure Coast),” Billings said. “A lot of us have the same mindset of using local, fresh fruit.”

When Billings created the Shore lb. beer for the annual Skim Jam competition, Ellison wanted a light beer everybody could drink at his events. It’s an IPA without the bite, and honey malt gives it a golden color.

Photos: Skimboarders shred the shore break during the 2018 Mulligan's Skim Jam in Vero Beach

Billings poured the beer into a glass and realized what it looked like.

“Florida in a bottle, sunshine in a glass” became the new group’s motto. They decided to do signature beers that represent their state.

“We want the brewery to be based on Florida,” Billings said.

They couldn’t trademark a name using “Sunshine State,” so they flipped it and found deeper meaning with State of Sunshine Brewing.

“You can be in a state of sunshine, and our beers can put you in that state,” Billings said. “But you’re also in the state of sunshine.”

The logo emphasizes the point.

“That sun looks mesmerizing,” Billings said, “like it’s trying to put you in the state of sunshine.”

They’ve created 25 to 30 different beers so far, and they’ve been entering local competitions.

They won at their debut event: the VIP party at Walking Tree Brewery before the Florida Craft Brew and Wingfest. They took second place with Shore lb. and third place with their Forbidden Fruit IPA with grapefruit.

Their Ohana Hawaiian rum porter with hibiscus and passion fruit won third place at Pareidolia Brewing Company’s homebrew competition. One of the judges, who were all local brewers and peers, wrote one phrase on the score card: “Mind blown.”

“I like to push the boundaries of flavor,” Billings said. “We do normal beers — we do the pilsners and the lagers and all that — but we try to do unique beers that you haven’t had before that keeps people talking.”

They can’t sell their beer until they open a brewery.

“We’re trying to build a brand,” Billings said. “We wanted to build a brand up so we have something to offer an investor.”

If they can’t find an investor, he said, they’re going to find a way to do it themselves.

Laurie's Stories: Palm City couple plans to open only brewery in Martin County next year

They’re looking to open the brewery west of Vero Beach, in the area of 58th Avenue or closer to Interstate 95.

“We really want to do a brewery that’s a destination brewery, kind of like Walking Tree,” Billings said.

Their goal would be for the brewery to be a place to go for live music and events on the weekends.

If they can’t afford to go that big in the beginning, he said, they will open just a small taproom and work their way up, just like Sailfish did.

“We just want to get the beer out there for people who have been asking and love it,” Billings said.

1136,Track & Field: Area schools grind through challenging district meets,"Rickards won a 2-2A boys title, Florida High the girls, while Lincoln and Maclay won both boys and girls in their respective districts

Buy Photo Lincoln senior Jaleel Howard high jumps at the District 3-3A track and field meet at Chiles on Monday, April 15, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Lincoln senior Jaleel Howard was in the high jump pit one moment and gone the next.

Seconds later, Howard sprinted back to the east end of Chiles’ track, by way of a 110-meter hurdle race.

Then in the middle of his high jump competition during Monday’s District 3-3A meet, he also headed back to the west end of the track to compete in triple jump, simultaneously.

It was a frenetic hour or so of competition for Howard.

And it embodied what most track and field athletes have to endure in their district meets – a schedule grind that allows little to no recovery time before an athlete’s next event.

Buy Photo Lincoln senior Jaleel Howard triple jumps at the District 3-3A track and field meet at Chiles on Monday, April 15, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

“I’m still surprised I pulled that off,” Howard said. “I had stopped doing hurdles in previous meets because it bothered my groin, but today I had to do it to put points on the board. I tried my best, then I had to do high jump and it was magic. I wish I had a break in between.

“I was whining before today, but today I couldn’t let down my teammates. I had to pull through and keep my mind clear.”

TRACK AND FIELD PREVIEW: Are there more gold medals in Rickards' future?

Howard’s magical jumps came while setting a new personal best in high jump. Previously his best was 6-02, but he exceeded that by four inches to win a district title.

“All last week, my coach had us in the weight room and she had us doing mat drills,” Howard said. “A couple days ago, my legs were dead, and I couldn’t go over six feet in practice. (Friday) night, I took an Epsom salt bath, stretched and prayed for God to help me perform to the best of my ability. I woke up in the morning, stretched, ate good, came out and jumped good.

“It feels great. My confidence level right now is real high, but I’ve got to stay humble.”

Buy Photo Lincoln senior Jaleel Howard high jumps at the District 3-3A track and field meet at Chiles on Monday, April 15, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Howard’s 10 points were part of a winning effort by Lincoln’s boys, which won the 3-3A title by 62 points ahead of Jacksonville Ed White.

“After state last year when Jaleel no-heighted in the high jump, he was hurt. He was hurting real bad,” Lincoln head coach Damarius Carroll said. “I told him if he wanted to go back to state and medal, he had to put more work in. This year, he came out more mature and became a leader on the team. He took practice more serious and it just came together for him. He PR’d when he needed to PR.”

Also winning district titles for the Trojans was junior thrower Tyren Hannah, who captured both discus and shot put, and junior jumper Chris Beard, who won triple jump in addition to qualifying for regionals in high jump (third) and long jump (second).

Lincoln’s 4x400 and 4x800 teams were also winners.

Meanwhile, the Trojans’ girls captured a championship trophy as well, edging Chiles by six points and doing it on the last event – the 4x400, which they won.

Buy Photo Lincoln's girls and boys track and field teams both captured District 3-3A titles on Monday at Chiles. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Despite running a few alternates in the 4x100 and 4x400 to allow its top sprinters to compete fully individually in sprints and jumps, Lincoln won both relays. Junior hurdler Jordan Deadwyler was a district champion in the 300m hurdles, and junior Macy Kelley captured shot put.

“I wanted them to have a lot more enthusiasm and a lot more passion this year,” said Carroll, operating as head coach for the first time. “We wanted to continue winning like we had in the years before with hard work, but at the same time have fun.

“I’m just happy because I was nervous. But it all come together. We did what we had to do as a team. A lot of people doubted us this year because we had graduated a lot of seniors.”

The 3-3A meet featured a Chiles girls 4x800 team that a couple weeks ago at Florida Relays broke the school record from 2012, a mark of 9:14.93 that temporarily put the Timberwolves in the No. 1 spot nationally.

Currently the mark is No. 4 nationally and the top mark in the state.

“They’ve been eye-balling that 4x800 record for a while,” Chiles head coach Mike Phillips said. “They really wanted that record this year, and they want first place at state. There will be a couple other teams going after it, but our girls are really strong. They double and triple pretty well, so they’ll have a good shot at it.”

The relay team members – juniors Caitlin Wilkey and Alyson Churchill and seniors Olivia Miller and Emily Culley – all were allowed one individual race to go hard in at districts. Wilkey won the 800, Churchill took the mile in 4:56, and Culley won the 3200. Miller and Churchill qualified for region in the 800 with Culley going in the 1600.

Buy Photo Chiles junior Alyson Churchill runs the 1600 during the District 3-3A track and field meet at Chiles on Monday, April 15, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Chiles also got two other distance runners out with senior Abby Schrobilgen and sophomore Lindsay James qualifying in the 3200.

“I think they’re ready to have great regional and state meets,” Phillips said. “They’re poised to peak at the right time. That can be a tricky thing, but they’re running really strong. I think we have a chance to score a lot of points.”

On Saturday at Florida High, Maclay captured District 3-1A boys and girls titles, ahead of NFC and FAMU DRS, respectively.

At the same venue, Rickards’ boys captured the 2-2A crown far ahead of runner-up Godby, while Florida High’s girls squeaked past Rickards by eight points.

For those athletes, it was a similar struggle to endure prelims and fall back into a rolling finals schedule that had challenges such as 4x100 relays immediately following the 100-yard dash.

It surely affected Gadsden County junior Dequavious Charleston, who only qualified for region in the 100 while then crushing a second leg of the Jaguars’ winning 4x100 relay.

But Charleston, who did not run the 200, took fifth in the 400 to miss out on another individual event – top four in an event go to region – after medaling (top eight) in the 100, 200 and 400 at last year’s Class 2A state meet.

Conversely, some managed better than others. In the 1A meet, Jefferson County junior Detrevian Nealy qualified for region in the max of four events – individually in the 100 (first), 200 (second) and 400 (first), while also running a 4x400 leg.

But that meant giving up on triple jump, in which Nealy finished fourth in the state last year.

It’s all strategy, and Rickards head coach Johnathan Butler found himself pondering the same “what if” questions every coach faced when determining the best route for success for their athletes and team.

“You have to take it one race at a time, that’s what I preached,” Butler said. “Trust the training and understand if you have to do two events back to back, it will be a grind. But your training is about accomplishing that.

“It’s hard to replicate the emotions and adrenaline of the meet, but you have to simulate as best as you can in practice so that it’s something they’ve faced.”

Raiders senior Christopher Robinson was one of Butler’s athletes asked to suck it up.

He had to run his 300-meter hurdle immediately following an individual 400, which he won with a PR. But running so fast in that race affected Robinson – fourth in Class 2A in the 300mH behind fellow senior and top-ranked Jabari Bryant – in the hurdles and he barely qualified for region in the event.

WATCH: Rickards senior Jabari Bryant on FSU Relays

But he’s through, as are others across the Big Bend.

Now, there’s significant rest before region meets on Saturday, April 27. Region 1-1A and 1-2A head to Bishop Snyder in Jacksonville, while Region 1-3A runs at Pensacola Washington. The state meet is May 4 and 5 in Jacksonville.

“Everything came so fast,” said Robinson, who was also third in the 110-meter high hurdles. “I had to really grind in the 400 to get first, then to come back in the 300 (hurdles) was really tough. I had to put my pride aside and just push for it.

“I just do whatever I have to do for my team, and I trust the process.”

1139,Living like a Tourist: Panhandle Opry,"CRESTVIEW —There are a lot of places around Crestview many people may not know about, but could be considered tourist attractions — such as the Panhandle Opry. Located at 657 DeShazo Road, it offers people a place to go for good, clean family fun.

“We have a great show,” said owner Gordon Porter. “If it’s sexually oriented songs, we either change the words or we don’t sing them.”

“People that don’t like to go to bars, this is the place for them,” added his wife, Corinne.

The Panhandle Opry started in 1979 at the Roadrunner Restaurant. The Opry moved to Niceville and several other places before Porter decided to build his own and bought a saw mill to start the construction.

Show attendees as well as the band built the Opry, according to Porter.

“On Saturdays, we would all get together and come out and work. We had a couple people working throughout the week,"" he said.

The seats in the building are theater seats from the Eglin Theater.

“I was doing a job down there and I bought them from the contractor that was taking them out when they were converting the theater to a class-type thing,” said Porter.

Porter and his wife said the Opry is a hobby for them.

“This is my fishing boat,” joked Porter.

The Opry stages events on the first and third Saturday of the month when the Panhandle Band plays live music. The band, which originally started years ago in Defuniak Springs, consists of family members and a few family friends.

“A bunch of people got together and played at that time,” said Porter. “We just did it because we liked it.”

“We didn’t charge anything,” said Corinne.

Last month, country music singer John Conlee performed at the Opry. Conlee drew a crowd of around 420 people. Porter said his son, Michael, has a band called Pickle Jar, which also occasionally plays at the shows.

“They’re a really professional group,” said Porter. “He (Michael) plays with us (Panhandle Band) as well.”

The Opry will celebrate its 40th anniversary in June. The anniversary show will be held on June 15.

“We invite all the people that’s been on here before, that’s retired and everything, to come back if they want to,” said Porter.

Many people have performed at the Opry over the years including: Marty Haggard, Ernie Ashworth and an Elvis impersonator from Dothan, Alabama, named Jerome Jackson.

Admission for the Opry ranges from $7 to $10 depending on age. Children under 6 get in free.

“We keep it low so everyone can come,"" said Porter. “We don’t take any money out of it; we just put it back in the show,” he added.

1140,Health Pro: Dr. White has passion for audiology health,"CLOSE Dr. Liz White recently opened Harbor City Hearing Solutions in Suntree/Viera. Wayne T. Price, FLORIDA TODAY

Q: Why did you go into this career?

A: My late father had a stroke when I was a senior in high school and saw a speech therapist due to aphasia caused by the stroke. I was still unsure what my career plans would be and my mother suggested speech therapy. Luckily, in my first semester at the University of Florida, I took an intro class to Communication Sciences and Disorders, learned about audiology and never looked back. The clinical Doctor of Audiology program peaked my interest as it was fairly new at the time.

Dr. Liz White, Harbor City Hearing Solutions (Photo: Pamela Scot Photography)

Q: What services do you provide?

A: Full diagnostic hearing evaluations, hearing aids, assistive-listening devices, personal sound amplifiers, in-ear music monitors.

Q: What makes this area of medicine fulfilling for you?

A: I love talking to patients about their hearing concerns. There’s so much more to hearing loss than what a graph tells us. In addition, the hearing device is not the end-all be-all. Follow up and counseling is just as important. I try to explain this to my patients and offer them the best solution possible.

Q: When did you realize this was the right medical career path for you?

A: I can’t think of an exact moment, however, when you help someone who hasn’t heard their friends, grandchildren or even just the birds for years, and the patient comes back to their follow-up appointment with stories of what they have been missing and are now finally hearing again, it makes you feel like you have improved someone’s quality of life. That is what is most important.

Q: What’s the latest advancement in your field that will benefit patients?

A: There is a lot changing in the field of Audiology within the last couple of years. I believe soon, many more people will have access to hearing devices.

Q: Best advice for current and potential patients?

A: If you are having concerns about hearing, do yourself a favor and see a professional about those concerns. Maintaining good hearing health is important to maintaining good brain health.

1141,Suspect argues 'stand your ground' in shooting death of BCU football player,"DeLAND, Fla. - A hearing for 26-year-old Lamont Postell started Monday with a Daytona Beach police officer who responded the night a Bethune Cookman University football player was shot to death taking the stand as a witness.

He told the judge officers tried to talk to several witnesses at Indigo Lakes Country Club, where the shooting took place during a party attended by many students from the university.

[PREVIOUS STORIES: Man charged in slaying of BCU football player claims 'stand your ground' | Bethune-Cookman University shooting suspect still behind bars | Bethune-Cookman University shooting suspect denied bond]

Eventually, a couple of witnesses identified the shooter as a man named ""Cornbread,"" who matched Postell's description.

The officer said it was the day after that Postell turned himself in to police after a warrant was issued for his arrest.

During the hearing, Postell's interview with detectives was played, during which he explained what happened that night at Indigo Lakes Country Club.

In the video, Postell denied shooting and killing Don'Kevious Johnson and injuring two others.

Postell is now claiming he was acting under Florida's ""stand your ground"" law when the shooting took place. His attorney filed a motion saying Postell was attacked first by Johnson and a friend during the party.

Postell faces charges of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder in connection with the 2016 shooting.

A second part of the hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.

MARTIN COUNTY— A judge allowed a video of Austin Harrouff ""fighting against his restraints"" while he was being treated at St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach in 2016 into evidence on Monday.

According to a motion filed by Harrouff's attorneys, the video shows the ""mental status"" of Harrouff two days after he was accused of killing a Martin County couple.

In February 2017, Harrouff's attorneys hired Dr. Phillip Resnick, a forensic psychiatrist at the University Hospitals of Cleveland in Ohio, who wrote in a document summarizing his findings that the 22-year-old suffered from a severe mental disease that caused him to not know his actions were wrong when he killed John Stevens III, 59, and Michelle Mishcon, 53, at their Southeast Kokomo Lane home in Martin County.

Harrouff faces two counts of first-degree murder with a weapon for the deaths of Mishcon and Stevens; one charge of burglary of a dwelling with assault or battery while armed for breaking into their garage; and one charge of attempted first-degree murder with a weapon for attacking and injuring the couple's neighbor, Jeffrey Fisher.

Harrouff, a Jupiter resident who was attending Florida State University, was found biting and chewing on Stevens' face in the couple's driveway on Aug. 15 2016. Detectives recovered what appeared to be flesh from Harrouff's teeth.

""The fact that Mr. Harrouff persisted in biting the male victim in the presence of police officers, in spite of being shot, being Tased and receiving multiple kicks to the heads, suggests that Mr. Harrouff was actively psychotic,"" Resnick wrote in a mental health report on Harrouff.

The motion filed April 5, also references an email from a Martin County deputy that said ""The nurse added a normal person should never wake up with the amount of sedation he is on. The nurse said they may have to give him meds to completely paralyze him, because when he wakes up his heart rate drops.""

Judge Sherwood Bauer Jr. agreed to allow the the 1 minute and 14 second video into evidence as long as the faces of hospital staff were blurred when the video was presented in court.

EFSC softball splits doubleheader, clinches postseason berth. The Eastern Florida State College softball team clinched a spot in the NJCAA District/FCSAA State Tournament on Saturday.

The Titans scored two runs in the bottom of the seventh inning to defeat Broward College 5-4 in the first game of the doubleheader. The Titans lost the second game, 7-4, but Indian River State College swept Miami Dade, clinching the spot for the Titans.

EFSC was two games ahead of Miami Dade with two games left. But the Titans hold the tiebreaker, beating Miami Dade in four of five meetings this season.

A couple of sophomores made sure they picked up a win in the first game on Sophomore Day at Titan Softball Complex. Down 4-3 in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Titans loaded the bases, and Hannah Crumblish tied the game with a sacrifice fly. Caitlyn Meyer then came up and hit a single that scored the winning run.

Crumblish also had a sacrifice fly in the second inning, and Hilana Figueroa Rodriguez drove in a run in the fourth inning.

In Game 2, the Titans got on the board in the first inning with Emily Bartlett’s RBI single. Broward scored twice in the third inning and four more times in the fourth inning to take a 6-1 lead.

The Titans scored three runs in the sixth inning but couldn’t get any closer.

Lexi Neiberline was perfect at the plate in both games, going 6 for 6 with six singles.

The Titans will host Palm Beach State College on Wednesday for a Southern Conference doubleheader beginning at 4 p.m. The state tournament begins May 2 at Boombah Soldiers Creek Park in Longwood.",http://rssfeeds.floridatoday.com/~/600862311/0/brevard/home~EFSC-softball-clinches-spot-in-NJCAA-DistrictFCSAA-State-Tournament/,2019-04-15T15:48:21Z,Florida Today,Couple,"1 Gannett Plaza Ave, Melbourne, FL 32940, USA",FL,32940

1145,Florida Department of Health emails show agency struggled to manage algae crisis,"With toxic algae fouling Southwest Florida’s inland waterways and coastline last year, state health officials faced a flood of worried questions as people turned to them for crisis leadership.

Some were specific: Were Caloosahatchee blue crabs safe to eat? Was it dangerous to breathe near the algae-choked canals? How about swimming in the Gulf?

Others were systemic: Who posts warning signs? Was any agency monitoring illness reports? Would water and air be tested for toxins?

As red tide devastated wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico from Sarasota to the Ten Thousand Islands, a simultaneous outbreak of blue-green algae contaminated the Caloosahatchee watershed. Images of bloated dolphin carcasses and people jet-boating through algae blooms filled news reports. Social media seethed with rumors and petitions. Former Gov. Rick Scott declared two states of emergency - one for each bloom.

Yet through it all, the Florida Department of Health stayed largely in the background. It refused The News-Press' interview requests and delayed responding or outright ignored emailed questions. To try to understand its internal workings, The News-Press obtained more than 2,500 emails from May 25 to Sept. 26. They reveal a hunkered-down agency scrambling to keep its message straight as the environmental calamity deepened.

Since then, the department hasn't responded to a number of requests made over multiple weeks for an interview that might offer insight into the department’s stance throughout the crisis and its future goals. That invitation is still open.

The public records request sought correspondence from the two officials whose names appeared in the infrequent press releases the department issued about the situation: Kendra Goff, state toxicologist and chief of the Bureau of Environmental Health, and Andy Reich, scientific adviser for the bureau. Each of the 2,661 emails was reviewed by the department’s legal team and sensitive information redacted. What remains in the cache, which The News-Press is still analyzing, chronicles a range of concerns. When worried citizens, persistent reporters and other government entities turned to the agency for guidance, they often came away with more questions than answers.

Ability, capacity and responsibility: Which agency does what?

Responsibilities and runarounds were common topics, even when officials from other agencies wrote the department. In August, for example, the Department of Environmental Protection’s John Calhoun asked about hot spot air testing: ”We are getting lots of calls from citizens requesting air testing around ponds with algae blooms. We usually refer to the County, who refer them to the local Health Dept, who refer them back to us and our Division of Air. Unfortunately, our Division of Air only does static monitoring of specific locations and doesn’t have the equipment to do local testing like that. Does DOH have any ability & capacity to do such localized air testing?”

Goff answered: “Unfortunately, we do not have any capabilities to perform air testing, localized or not. For more information on harmful algal blooms, people can be directed to our website. In general, we advise folks to take precautions around water bodies that may have harmful algal blooms. Happy to chat further.”

When the public emailed with questions, officials didn't always answer. And when they did, some of their correspondents, like Ralph Quillen, found the exchanges frustrating.

Concerned for the health of his two young daughters, Quillen pressed Angela Smith, who administers Lee's health department, to tell him whether the island was safe for his girls. She responded with generalities and gave him some informational links. They went back and forth a couple of times until Quillen had enough.

""Thank you for your response but you did not answer my question. Is it safe for my family to live in these conditions with these algae blooms and this red tide?"" he wrote. ""Why can't I get a straight answer?""

After that, Smith didn't write back.

He repeatedly contacted the Florida Department of Health during the red tide/cyanobacteria crisis and was not satisfied with the answers he got from them. (Photo: Andrew West, The News-Press USA Today Network-Florida)

Dagmar and Steve Martin, who live on a dead-end Cape Coral canal contacted the department in July about the algae's foul smell. ""We are permanent residents and have no other place to stay. We don't know how toxic the algae is ... We are hoping to get help as soon as possible!”

The email wound up in Reich's queue; but he did not write the Martins back.

Aug. 22, 2018, Pam Cox sent the department what she called a plea ""to acknowledge the conditions with the Red Tide/Blue Green Algae crisis. Your website and silence on the current health situation is gross negligence ... PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ... whoever is monitoring this mailbox, bring it forward to others in your office. Don't just send an automated reply and delete it.""

Reich wrote back: “Dear Ms. Cox Thank you for your email to Florida Department of Health. The Department's role in responding to red tide events relates to health concerns. You can find information on health effects of algal blooms on our website. Sincerely, Andrew Reich""

Aug. 17, JoEllyn Bavosa wrote asking ""When will you help? When will you start testing? When will you issue warnings to the public about Cyanobacteria? This is not just Red Tide anymore and has not been for a very long time. With hope that your agency will step forward and help.”

Reich didn’t write Bavosa back, but he did send a colleague this: “There really is nothing we can say to address this email. Andy.”

Other correspondence included:

► Reich’s response about whether freshly hunted alligator meat from an area of bloom is safe to eat: “It’s my best guess that the toxins would not accumulate in the muscle tissue but without data, there is no way of knowing for sure.”

► Goff telling epidemiology department chief, physician Russell Eggert, July 12, “We would like to discuss how we are going to handle these inquiries and we will need some help. We are not used to this volume of inquiries.”

► Martin County environmentalist and former commissioner Maggy Hurchalla writing: “This is Florida’s Flint, Michigan – ignoring a problem because it is too scary and difficult to deal with.”

► And in one of Goff’s email threads, Martin County Commissioner Ed Fielding wrote presciently: “It portends to be a long, disastrous summer.”

Internally, officials repeatedly emphasized the need for a unified front.

In July, after then-Gov. Scott declared a state of emergency,Eggert, the epidemiology chief, asked Reich if the declaration should be discussed during a regular conference call with the epidemiology staff of the state's county health departments.

""Yes,"" answered Reich. ""I think the issue of health impacts might become more important. Should (epidemiology and environmental health departments) discuss together to make sure we have a consistent approach? ""

In August, Reich convened a phone conference with county health leaders and spokespeople statewide to “facilitate coordination and consistent messaging.”

Once warning signage became a source of concern, the department changed course. In June, it told a News-Press reporter that signs were not its responsibility. Then in August, it told the same reporter “We’ve posted hundreds of signs.”

The reporter responded: ""Back in June, I started asking the local DOH about just that, and was told in no uncertain terms that posting blue-green algae warning signs is not the department’s role. Attached please find emails saying just that, and contradicting what you wrote. So, I’m not sure who’s mistaken here, but I’d like to know what the case is.""

Spokesman Brad Dalton later wrote back: ""After speaking with the county office I believe the issue is that the work done in the community concerning signage was performed after the communication between you two.""

In their emails, department officials regularly discussed media coverage both local and national – from The Wall Street Journal to The New York Times, with Reich expressing relief that he hadn’t appeared in a Times story. “Glad my name didn’t show up,” he wrote a colleague.

They criticized some of the local stories. After a TV segment appeared, Goff wrote: “It is a shame that we can be misquoted so easily. No wonder we get the calls that we do from citizens confused on this topic. Angela, you and I have chatted about those challenges and sometimes backfiring with the media even if we are trying to provide the most accurate and current scientific information. Totally understand it's sometimes beyond our control how the Department is quoted. I think we are only seeing the beginning of this if this article is any indication.”

Shortly after one of The News-Press' stories about the department came out, one official included this comment with an online link: “FYI This article does not portray FL DOH in a positive light.”

Bloom season approaches: What's been done; what's left to do

As the next steamy summer season approaches, the potential for more outbreaks looms and it's unclear how the department would handle another crisis

A number of its key positions are vacant – a recently requested organizational chart shows no surgeon general, chief of staff or head of the legislative planning office.

Some of its approaches have changed since last year.

It's rolled out an informational web page on cyanobacteria, it's ramped up its outreach on aquatic toxins and it appears it's now taking responsibility for posting warning signs.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has called for a harmful algal blooms task force and emphasized a science-based approach to fighting toxic algae outbreaks, but his office hasn't answered calls or emails asking about the administration’s goals for the health department.

A patchwork of nonprofits, educational institutions and citizen initiatives are filling the leadership void. FGCU and Florida Atlantic University quickly received emergency funding to study the potential health effects of cyanobacteria. Lee Health began collecting data from its patients about exposure to blooms and symptoms. Several social media groups disseminate news and outbreak information. And Calusa Waterkeeper got a grant from the Southwest Florida Community Foundation specifically to do what the department hasn't: engage with health care workers and decision-makers about cyanobacteria's effects with a series of public events.

Calusa Waterkeeper John Cassani offered a to-do list he'd like to see the department tackle that includes:

Raising the the department's public profile in the media so that people can easily determine potential health risks from exposure to algae

Increasing the number of monitoring stations for airborne algal toxins.

Posting comprehensive toxin concentrations and health guidelines about various forms of exposure in cooperation with Florida Department of Environmental Protection waterbody monitoring

Establishing a clear policy on how and when health advisories will be made; including signage guidelines

Creating a citizen hotline on the blooms

Developing an interagency public health working group to advise the department on the most current information about health effects of blooms.

CLOSE Sanibel resident not satisfied with Florida Health Department response to algae crisis. Andrew West, News-Press

To Whom It May Concern

After a three-week vacation in early August, health coach Ralph Quillen had returned home to Sanibel to find the island hemmed in by red tide, as toxic cyanobacteria flowed down the Caloosahatchee.

Alarmed, Quillen wrote city government – “I need to know if it is safe for my family, specifically my 3 and 6 year old girls to live in these conditions” – and was directed to the Lee County branch of the Florida Department of Health.

His question was simple: “Is it safe for my family to live on Sanibel in these conditions?”

Angela Smith, who administers Lee's health department, wrote back: “We are not aware of any long term negative effects of red tide. For most people, symptoms are temporary and resolve when the person leaves the proximity of the impacted water. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on your family specifically due to the fact that K. brevis impacts individuals so differently. Some individuals experience “red tide tickle” while others do not. Still other individuals with existing pulmonary issues may experience more severe reactions.I would encourage you to speak with your healthcare provider if you have specific questions regarding your family’s health.”

Quillen replied: “Hello Angela, Thank you for your response but you did not answer my question. Is it safe for my family to live in these conditions with these algae blooms and this red tide? We have over 100 children on Sanibel and the island is surrounded with this poison. Should the school be handing out filter masks? What are the long term effects? Will this affect our children's health in the future. Why can't I get a straight answer?”

Smith wrote back to tell him, among other things, that ""For sensitive individuals, wearing a particle filter mask may lessen the effects, and over-the-counter antihistamines decrease symptoms."" She also referred him to the Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and to Mote Marine's online beach report.

By now, Quillen said, he was getting frustrated. “Hi Angela, Thanks for your response but I think I am going to have ask this question again. It is a yes or no question. Is my family safe to live on this island? Is the air safe? Also, has Lee county been running air quality tests? Are the tests available to review? Have you been out to the island to see the devastation? … I look forward to your response.”

But after that, Smith never responded, even though she blind-copied Quillen’s emails up the chain of command until they reached Reich.

Quillen's conclusion?. “The emails speak for themselves. They basically did nothing. And we’re still left with no answers.""

The News-Press repeatedly queried the department as well, even finding an email this reporter had sent to a university professor (who doesn't work at the department) about the department’s ongoing silence in Reich’s queue: “I’ve had a devil of a time communicating with the Florida Department of Health. Among other things, I’ve been asking about whether local fish catches are being monitored or tested, as well as non-fin fish seafood, especially blue crabs. Most importantly, though, I wanted them to tell me if there’s any kind of epidemiologic surveillance plan in place – or being discussed – for short- and long-term human health impacts, whether it’s something the DOH would do, or if not what agency would.” His receipt of the email notwithstanding, Reich never responded to her.

Other citizens who wrote got shorter responses – if they got any. Here are some excerpts:

July 11, Dagmar and Steve Martin of Cape Coral wrote:

“We live at the end of a canal … The algae's smell really bad. We can't sit outside or even work in the backyard … The smell is already in the house. We are concerned about our health. It's impossible to live like that! There are small children living in the neighborhood as well. We are permanent residents and have no other place to stay. We don't know how toxic the algae is. We experience a dry and scratchy throat and believe it has to do with the bad smell. We don't know if there are injured or dead fish or other wild life. We are hoping to get help as soon as possible!”

No return email was included in the public records The News-Press received.

Aug. 17, JoEllyn Bavosa wrote:

“As a resident of Florida for over 20 years it is a huge concern of mine to find that our waters have not and are not being tested for Cyanobacteria. As we are NOW in a state of emergency and our canals, bays and gulf are filled with ""green slime"" and our marine life is dead or dying, I was wondering when exactly we would start testing for Cyanobacteria and the toxin it releases? I have asked our local Sarasota Board of Health and the response was and still is, we only test what we are told to test. Another concern is that the County and State Officials make it perfectly clear that our beaches are open, and have never closed, and ""sure you can go out there, however I would not."" (City of Sarasota 6/16/18 video) When questions are asked of our ""Officials,"" they refer us to Mote marine, who does not even staff a Cyanobacteria specialist or to your Department. Cyanobacteria, as I am sure you are aware, risks the very health, lives and water we drink, of the people exposed to it for prolonged periods of time. When will you help? When will you start testing? When will you issue warnings to the public about Cyanobacteria? This is not just Red Tide anymore and has not been for a very long time. With hope that your agency will step forward and help.”

No return email was included in the public records The News-Press received, but Reich did send a colleague this: “There really is nothing we can say to address this email. Andy.”

Aug. 22, Pam Cox wrote:

“This email is a plea to the team at the FL Department of Health to acknowledge the conditions with the Red Tide/Blue Green Algae crisis. Your website and silence on the current health situation is gross negligence on the mission of your department ""“to protect, promote and improve the health of all people in Florida through integrated state, county, and community efforts”. I have to believe that people who work at the FDOH are members of the communities who are impacted by this man-made ecological disaster. There are many scientists who have researched and provided evidence of the health risks. The citizens of Florida are getting sick and are outraged that the state is not doing anything. I realize this is not an easy situation and politics are playing a huge role in determining what employees of the state are willing to say. However, this issue is attacking the health of people in Florida and the FDOH needs to get involved. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE .... whoever is monitoring this mailbox, bring it forward to others in your office. Don't just send an automated reply and delete it. Read my words, feel the tears and despair that I and my fellow Floridians are feeling. Help us by acknowledging the issues and standing with us to request attention and funding from the state.”

1152,New Winter Haven fire chief a 'progressive' thinker,"David Knowles said he believes in the public safety model for providing the best service to the citizens of Winter Haven, where both the police and fire departments line up under Public Safety Chief Charlie Bird.

WINTER HAVEN — The newest fire chief in Winter Haven, Deputy Fire Chief David Knowles, 52, comes to the helm with over 30 years of experience in fire services and said he felt drawn to the city's ""hometown"" feel.

Knowles said he believes in the public safety model for providing the best service to the citizens of Winter Haven, where both the police and fire departments line up under Public Safety Chief Charlie Bird. Police and fire both have a deputy chief in charge of their agency who is accountable to Bird.

As for his belief on what makes a successful department?

""Communications,"" he said. ""Constant, appropriate, and positive communications ... the failure of any organizational structure, whether it is management, business, relationships, divorces, is in poor communication.""

""We want to be the best we can be, we want to work for the best organization we can work for. We will work together as a team of 72. Everybody wants to be the best. Nobody wants to work for a sub-par agency,"" he said.

Knowles said he would like to see the fire department be more visible in the community, from going into the high schools and introducing students to possible careers down the road, to educating the community as to the equipment needs of the department.

Knowles has two children and three grandchildren. His daughter, Jamie Conoly, is a stay-at-home mom and his son, Justin Knowles, is a commercial helicopter pilot. He's engaged to Stacy Vining.

Past experience

Knowles got his start in public safety working at the Lakeland Fire Department from 1997 to 1998 as an EMS supervisor. From there, he moved to Ocala, taking a job as firefighter/paramedic at Marion County Fire Rescue. Over the years, he's also served with the Seminole Tribe of Florida as an emergency services administrator, with Nature Coast Emergency Medical Services in Lecanto, then advanced his career by taking a captain position at Citrus County Fire Rescue, where he spent six years. When he left Citrus County, he went to Levy County BoCC as a public safety director.

His road hasn't always been easy, he acknowledges. He experienced some pushback from a couple of Levy county commissioners when he gave 14 probationary employees raises after they finished their probation.

Noting that there are always ""three sides"" to every story, Knowles said that it was specified in the union contract that upon completion of their probation, the employees were to receive a 3 percent pay increase. ""Whether the union felt there was a different interpretation of that contract, we like to have faulted on the employee's side, than not.""

Knowles resigned his post after a discussion with his supervisor, Levy County Coordinator Fred Moody. ""We had two county commissioners who didn't feel the organizational structure was going the way they would like to see it go,"" said Knowles.

The budget he managed there grew from $4.5 million to nearly $9 million.

He said that in his years there, the department never went over budget, nor asked for an increase in the budget, to support itself.

Bird said the city put Knowles through the same intense background check they do when they hire police officers, which includes file reviews, polygraph testing, and a social media background check.

Bird said some of the ""pushback"" came up in the social media background, and that the city went to Levy County to examine the complaints.

There were 15 complaints, Bird said, most of which, he noted ""were really silly, like people not getting reports done by the end of shift.""

Bird said some of the employees were promoted with the understanding they would get certain certifications, and when they did not, he demoted them. ""That made us feel so much better,"" Bird said, regarding the complaints in his file.

As far as Knowles' resignation from Levy County, Bird said that some of the elected officials had praised him, while a few others did not.

""There were two new commissioners with a different agenda, a different philosophy,"" he said. ""Everything we looked at as far as what he put in place — we were happy with the direction he took. Those are fair questions ... he was very up front and honest. I put him through the ringer, and so did City Manager Mike Herr. You want to make sure you have the right guy.""

A New Jersey woman faces four years in state prison on suspicion of scamming more than $400,000 from GoFundMe donors while claiming to be collecting money for a homeless man in Philadelphia.Katelyn McClure, 29, pleaded guilty to one count of theft by deception in the second degree Monday in Burlington County, New Jersey.In the viral story from 2017 that made national headlines, New Jersey resident McClure ran out of gas and was stranded on Interstate 95 in Philadelphia. The homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt Jr., supposedly saw her and gave her his last $20 for gas.McClure and her then-boyfriend, Mark D'Amico, posted about the ""good deed"" on social media, including a picture of her with Bobbitt on a highway ramp. They also started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the homeless man, saying they wanted to pay it forward to the good Samaritan and get him off the streets.Bobbitt pleaded guilty at the local level to one count of conspiracy to commit theft by deception last Friday. He faces a five-year special probation period that requires him to enter the state Superior Court drug court program, in which he'll be expected to get a job and adhere to a structured regimen of treatment and recovery services. Any infractions could bring him a five-year prison sentence, according to Joel Bewley, a spokesman for the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office.CNN reached out to Bobbitt's attorney for comment but has not heard back.Both Bobbitt and McClure agreed to testify against D'Amico, who has yet to enter a plea in Burlington County court on charges of theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception in the second degree. His case is scheduled to be presented next month to a Burlington County grand jury for a possible indictment.Both McClure and Bobbitt also pleaded guilty to federal charges in early March.D'Amico is not currently facing federal charges.McClure's lawyer said she had tried to stop the GoFundMe page and D'Amico wouldn't let her.""We've indicated throughout it's my view that Mr. D'Amico is the real agent provocateur in this matter.Kate's role from the beginning was to help Mr. Bobbitt,"" said McClure's attorney, Jim Gerrow.""Kate has been strong. She's devastated by this and has been, but we look to the sentencings in federal and state courts, and hopefully, we can find sufficient evidence to convince both judges of her role and the fact that throughout this, she started out with benign motive, her hope to help Johnny Bobbitt and not to enrich herself or anyone else.""The couple transferred the funds to their bank account and bought a BMW, expensive handbags and went on trips, including to casinos in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Nevada, according to court documents.McClure transferred $25,000 from her bank account to Bobbitt's in December 2017, federal prosecutors said. He received a total of $75,000 from the campaign, according to Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina.GoFundMe has since made refunds to thousands of people who donated thinking they were giving to Bobbitt. Both Bobbitt and McClure must pay back the money in restitution, per their state court plea deals.The story began to fall apart after Bobbitt sued McClure and D'Amico, accusing them of withholding the money raised on his behalf.""In reality, McClure never ran out of gas and Bobbitt never spent his last $20 for her,"" according to a U.S. attorney's office press release. ""D'Amico and McClure allegedly conspired to create the false story to obtain money from donors.""The federal cases have not been settled. McClure could face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

1155,Ned Kirsch's death 'not believed to be related to a public health concern',"CLOSE According to the Florida Health Department, hepatitis A is a highly contagious disease that attacks the liver. and the est way to avoid the virus is through diligent cleanliness and a vaccine. GINNY BEAGAN Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

MARTIN COUNTY — According to Vermont Health Department spokesman Ben Truman, Ned Kirsch's death ""is not believed to be related to a public health concern.""

Less than a month after his brother and sister-in-law died from complications of hepatitis A, and just days after he visited Palm City where they lived, Ned Kirsch, of Burlington, Vermont, died.

According to Truman, Ned Kirsch's death is being investigated by the Vermont agency in conjunction with the Martin County Health Department.

More: Ned Kirsch, brother of Jeffrey Kirsch, died Wednesday

Truman said the Vermont Medical Examiner's Office still is working to find Ned's cause of death and that a death certificate has not been created yet.

Jeffrey and Nancy Kirsch, both 62, were found dead in their home in March from complications of hepatitis A, according to health officials.

A couple who lived down the street from the Kirsches in Palm City, Martin Gucciardo and his wife, also got the virus. He told TCPalm reporters they didn't know Jeffrey and Nancy Kirsch.

Florida health officials in Martin County on Tuesday were reporting 19 cases of Hepatitis A, as well as three deaths. The number has not changed since Friday.

The county is experiencing an outbreak and has been considered a ""high risk"" area since April 1 when it reached five confirmed cases of the virus.

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious disease that attacks the liver and rarely causes death. The majority of the people that get the virus have flu-like symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and fevers, but recover within a week or two.

Dr. Carina Blackmore, state epidemiologist, said it is unusual for three people with the virus to die in one county in less than a month. She said there's been a clustering of hepatitis A cases in Palm City, but she believes that is random.

More:How Hep A can take a toll on local economy

The next level after an outbreak for a virus is an endemic, which the county is nowhere near reaching, said Florida Department of Health's Martin County spokeswoman Renay Rouse. For an area to be considered part of an endemic, the county has to regularly see people with the virus over a long period of time.

Ned Kirsch, 53, spoke to TCPalm April 5. He said his brother told him he thought he had the flu.

“It’s all very strange to us,” he said about their deaths. “It makes no sense to us.”

1158,"When is Orlando in Melbourne and Sanford? When money, fliers, SEO and lawyers are involved","It’s wonderful living in this part of Florida, especially if you like to vacation out of state.

In my four decades here, I’ve arranged flights into or out of eight airports within 2.5 hours of my home — from Sanford to Miami and as far west as St. Petersburg-Clearwater.

To me, it’s about cost and convenience, so I’ve never flown from airports in my hometown of Vero Beach or Daytona Beach.

I rarely fly out of my favorite airport, Melbourne, because it has higher prices and few direct flights. That’s my chief complaint.

The folks running Orlando International Airport (MCO) have a bigger complaint about their counterparts in Melbourne.

In part, it supposedly relates to something like this:

Many Floridians understand the state’s airport landscape. Many of the tens of millions of tourists who visit our region annually don’t.

Like the panicked couple from Kentucky I met at Sanford’s airport last summer. They’d delivered a vehicle to a relative near Lakeland and booked a flight home from “Orlando.”

They were worried they’d miss their plane because they were more than an hour behind schedule. That’s how long it took them to get from the Orlando International Airport off the Beachline Expressway in Orange County to what’s officially called Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB) in Seminole County.

They’re really lucky they were not flying out of what’s called Orlando Melbourne International Airport (MLB) in Brevard County. That could have added more than an hour to their trip.

They were confused, probably like others, about which “Orlando” airport they were flying out of.

A rug in the meeting room of the Orlando Melbourne International Airport bears a contested name: Orlando airport authorities want the Melbourne airport to drop the “Orlando,” saying it causes confusion. (Photo: MALCOLM DENEMARK/FLORIDA TODAY)

More: Orlando airport authority sues Melbourne counterparts over name

This, in part, is why the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority, a governmental agency that operates MCO, the massive airport in Orange County, on March 19 sued the Melbourne Airport Authority in federal court.

The Orlando folks also allege MLB has violated the big airport’s trademark and falsely advertises its proximity to the theme park region.

The federal complaint lists several allegations about an airport Google Maps tells me is 62.7 miles away from MCO. The complaint cites 2015 Melbourne authority minutes stating the importance of using Orlando to lure internet search traffic to connect the airport to theme parks in Central Florida.

More: No confusion, no reason to settle potential case, Melbourne mayor says in 2017

Melbourne started marketing the Orlando tag in 2010 and its website visits increased from 1.5 million to 5.0 million, according to Florida Today. GOAA didn’t get stoked until about 2015.

Meantime, GOAA has a similar issue with the folks in Sanford. The airport in Seminole County has a real identity problem if you look at the website of its main airline, Allegiant Air: It lists flights from Orlando/Sanford and Daytona Beach/Sanford.

It’s not the only place for potential confusion. Think about Chicago and the four airports that have the Windy City in their names:

Chicago Midway, 11 miles from downtown.

Chicago O’Hare, 17 miles.

Gary Chicago, 29 miles.

Chicago Rockford, 86 miles.

Based on Rockford, maybe Vero Beach should start calling itself Orlando Vero Beach airport. It’s only 98 miles from MCO.

Just kidding.

Buy Photo Larry Reisman (Photo: PATRICK DOVE/TCPALM)

In a recent Facebook post, readers disagreed on whether the Orlando monikers were confusing. One former Vero Beach resident said he was trying to fly to Melbourne to visit Vero Beach, but was worried he’d end up in Orlando.

Some folks suggested no one owns the right to use the “Orlando” name and the only winner here would be the lawyers.

I agree. I also thought Patrick Swift’s comment was prescient:

“Interesting situation ... I don’t blame Melbourne for trying to cash in on Orlando’s popularity and I don’t blame Orlando for trying to maintain their market share.”

A 2017 Florida Today article quoted Frank Kruppenbacher, chairman of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority.

""It's really about protecting the consumer and the brand,"" he said, adding he hoped for an equitable solution between the two airports.

""The issue is really about confusion,"" he said, adding it was not about passenger revenue.

If it’s really about confusion, there’s a simple middle ground everyone could agree with: Allow Melbourne and Sanford to rebrand themselves using their city names first and Orlando, as in the region, like the Gary airport does.

The lack of agreement between three governmental airport authorities who are supposed to serve us, the public, suggests the real issue is something else: market share, which some people might call greed.

The Orlando regional air market is big enough for everyone. There were 323,160 commercial flights into and out of MCO in 2018, 20,691 at SFB and 5,103 at MLB, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Activities System.

The inability of adults to work together could drive up the costs in each of the airports, to pay lawyers. That’s money that could have been spent more productively: on airport improvements, airline incentives, raises for airport employees, etc.

Can’t everyone work together without lawyers getting in the way?

1161,Motorcyclist killed in Mandarin lived life 'to the fullest',"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Jacksonville man whose brother was killed in a motorcycle crash in Mandarin remembers the 34-year-old as someone who lived life to the fullest.

The man's body was found on the side of Plummer Grant Road on Thursday. Neil Estrada, the man's brother, identified the motorcyclist as Tommy Flipse, whom he remembers as kind and selfless.

""He (Flipse) was one of those guys who would walk in, smile and change the whole vibe of the room,"" Estrada said. ""Lived life 100%. To the fullest.""

ORIGINAL STORY: Residents say man killed on Mandarin road was on motorcycle

""He took his shoes off and gave this man his shoes while we were at the gas station pumping gas and went home with no shoes on. That's the type of man he was,"" Estrada said.

Residents who live in the area said speed is an issue on the road. The posted speed limit is 30 mph.

""He (Flipse) was going home. He only lives a block and a half away. I know he was with a couple of friends playing pool before that.” Estrada said.

LINK: Donation account for Neil Estrada's family

Neighbors believe Flipse struck a guy wire, lost control of his bike and died. His bike stopped more than 150 feet away from where the guy wire was located.

Surveillance video from a nearby home captured the crash. Surveillance video News4Jax received from the family shows the crash, plus a vehicle that appears to be a police patrol car driving up to the scene, flashing its spotlight and then driving away.

“What’s interesting is that what appears to be a police vehicle looks at the scene of the accident and leaves,"" said Gust Sarris, the family's attorney. ""So that just leave a lot of questions for the family that they believe they need answered.”

A spokesperson for the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office released a statement reading:

""The officer called it in and then was made aware the body was at a different location. The officer went to the location of the body.”

As of Monday, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office had not released the police report from the crash.

CHICAGO — As late-season snow blanketed the Chicago area, WGN's Andrea Darlas headed to Wrigley Field to document the scene outside the ballpark and talk to fans about the team canceling its afternoon game due to the weather.

After they set up nearby, a photographer noticed something happening in front of the field: a man getting down on one knee, and taking a woman's hand.

The camera rolled as Clint Parkinson proposed to his girlfriend Clohe Ludwig. It was a candid moment they will remember forever, which by pure luck was also captured on camera.

Speaking after the proposal, the couple told Darlas he's from California and she's from the Chicago area, but they met in Denver.

""I had an inkling that it was going to be this weekend, I didn't know when,"" Ludwig said.

The couple was surrounded by family, so she says she had a feeling something was up. Which wasn't a surprise for Parkinson.

""I figured out that she knew when I saw that she got her nails done, and she never gets her nails done,"" he said.

She said ""yes,"" or more specifically, ""I think I said, ' you have to put the ring on me,'"" Ludwig said.

Actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, entered a not guilty plea Monday and are waiving their right to appear in court for an arraignment in their alleged involvement in the college admissions scandal. Loughlin and Mossimo were charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and an additional charge of money laundering.The two appeared in federal court last week but said they were “not ready” to enter a plea. The couple were of the few who didn’t enter a plea while several others, including actress Felicity Huffman, entered a guilty plea in the case. Loughlin is accused of giving around $500,000 to a fake charity, according to CNN, to get her daughters into college at the University of Southern California. The daughters reportedly posed as crew recruits despite not being athletes for the sport. According to CNN, the two were also accused of conspiring to launder bribes and other payments through a charity run by Rick Singer, the mastermind of the scam, as well as transferring money into the United States to promote the fraud, prosecutors said.The charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud are punishable by a maximum 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. The charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering is punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to federal officials.The couple are among 33 parents accused of using their wealth to cheat on standardized tests for their children, and bribe college administrators and coaches who had major clout when it came to admissions.CNN contributed to this report.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/actress-lori-loughlin-husband-plead-not-guilty-in-college-admissions-scandal/27149815,2019-04-15T14:56:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
1164,"3 charged after man killed, body dumped near Fort White","COLUMBIA COUNTY, Fla. - Two men are facing murder charges and a woman has been charged as an accomplice after a 29-year-old was killed last week and his body was dumped along a road near Fort White, according to the Columbia County Sheriff's Office.

A couple walking their dog found the body of Steven McGee last Monday in a wooded area along Old Spanish Road near the Columbia-Suwannee county line.

By Friday, deputies had tracked down two of the people they believe were responsible for McGee's death and dumping his body.

Dashan Ricardo Lewis, 42, and Danielle Katherine Cianelli, 22, both of Lake City, were arrested and are being held without bond.

Lewis was charged with premeditated first-degree murder with firearm discharge, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, possession of a controlled substance, unlawful storage or transport of human remains, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.

Cianelli was charged with accessory after the fact to premeditated first-degree murder with firearm discharge, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, possession of a controlled substance, and unlawful storage or transport of human remains.

“I’m extremely proud of the hard work that led to these arrests,” Sheriff Mark Hunter said Friday. “Detectives worked tirelessly around the clock to remove these dangerous suspects from our community and to provide much-needed closure and comfort to the victim’s family. We know nothing can take away the pain of losing a loved one, but we strive to give every victim’s family the answers they deserve.”

The Sheriff's Office announced Monday morning that a third arrest had been made in the case after U.S. marshals helped track Cody Bartosek, 28, to a Super 8 motel off State Road 47 in Lake City.

Bartosek was arrested on a warrant for premeditated murder, using a firearm in commission of a felony, felon in possession of a firearm, tampering with and destroying evidence, and mishandling of human remains. He is also being held without bond in the Columbia County Detention Facility.

“We are extremely grateful to the U.S Marshals Service for their continued assistance,” Hunter said. “Our community can breathe a collective sigh of relief as all the suspects are in custody and they will now face justice.”

1167,"See the weekend meteor that lit up the sky in North Florida, Georgia","CLOSE Surveillance captured meteor in the Tallahassee. Courtesy of Cole Tessier, Tallahassee Democrat

Jania Kadar and her friend were cleaning up in the backyard after a gathering of friends in eastern Tallahassee when the night sky lit up.

“It was like someone turned on the stadium lights,” the Tallahassee resident said. “I look up and there is this bluish-green flash. It almost looks like daylight.”

“It lasted it felt like seconds,” she said of the sighting near midnight. “The second my brain wanted me to say ‘what is that?’, it was over…”

While tracking rain over Mississippi and Alabama, a trace of a meteor streaking across the sky was picked up by the National Weather Service's GOES satellite. (Photo: NWS Tallahassee)

What Kadar saw was actually a meteor or meteorite that streaked across the sky and was visible across a wide swath of South Georgia and North Florida. The fireball was caught by night owls, dash cams and surveillance videos across the region.

The National Weather Service Tallahassee picked up the chunk of space rock streaking across the sky on its GOES satellite system.

“It basically has a global lightning mapper and picks out bright cloud flashes from lightning when we have thunderstorms,” said Kelly Godsey, a NWS meteorologist.

They also tracked social media reports from Valdosta, Ga., Tallahassee, Wakulla County, Gainesville and Jacksonville.

For the Tallahassee area, it would have appeared as a brief 5 seconds of illumination between about 11:52 and 11:54 p.m. (Saturday), Godsey said. It may have even crashed to earth.

“We've heard reports that it landed near Perry, FL, which would match with the GLM data, but can't confirm anything,” NWS tweeted. “The satellite data suggests that *if* it landed, though, it was in FL.”

That NWS confirmation was an ah-ha moment for Kadar Sunday morning. After the flash, she and her friend immediately began speculating, and even second guessing, what they saw.

“We had a couple of beers so there was that…” she said. “At the time we were playing around with some pretty extraterrestrial theories. Of course, our husbands were oblivious. They were schlepping stuff in and out of the house.”

UFOs over Tallahassee?

The moment even surprised those who have been looking up at the stars for years. Andy Flower, who has been studying the sky for six years as a member of Tallahassee's Astronomical Society was packing up with a colleague after a night at the organization's observatory near the Cypress Landing boat ramp on Lake Miccosukee.

About 15 people had come out earlier to observe the new moon.

""Everyone had already left, and all of a sudden the whole sky lit up,"" he said.

Flower has seen dozens of meteors in his life, even two small ones earlier that night. But nothing like this.

""The whole area turned to daylight,"" he said. ""We were like 'what the ...? Is there a helicopter over us, a spotlight?' ""

""We looked up and saw a streak in the sky directly overhead that ended in a fireball about halfway to the horizon in the direction of the parking lot.""

It will be a night to remember and talk about for Flower, Kadar and others in the Big Bend.

“It was absolutely incredible,” Kadar said. “It was like a ball of energy that flew across the sky.”

1168,Money for colleges a battleground between Florida House and Senate,"TALLAHASSEE — With spending problems at Florida universities drawing scrutiny — and the resignation of the University of Central Florida’s president — higher education dollars are emerging as a battleground for state House and Senate budget writers.

Dueling state spending blueprints set for votes this week in the House and Senate take vastly different approaches to financing Florida’s universities and colleges. The Senate spends $285.3 million more in a higher education budget topping $6 billion.

“We clearly have a lot of work to do to get the two sides together,” said Sen. Kelli Stargell, R-Lakeland, chair of the Senate Education budget panel.

The biggest clash between the two Republican-controlled chambers is over Florida’s 12 public universities, where the House proposes $100 million in across-the-board cuts — a 2.5 percent reduction — along with an additional $20 million drop in preeminence funding which goes to the University of Florida, Florida State University, the University of South Florida and the University of Central Florida.

Preeminence funding, an award aimed at encouraging research and student performance, currently amounts to $152 million for the schools. The 13 percent reduction would bring it down to its level in 2017-18, according to House leaders.

The Senate generally beefs-up dollars for university programs and projects.

The two sides do match up in some areas. Neither is calling for tuition hikes — which Gov. Ron DeSantis also opposes — and the House and Senate are seeking $69.7 million more for Bright Futures scholarships, basically to cover an anticipated 113,902 students.

Benacquisto Scholarships, which go to National Merit Scholars, also draw an additional $4.3 million in both budget proposals, bringing the program to $21.4 million for an expected 1,416 students.

Rep. Randy Fine, R-Palm Bay, chairs the Higher Education Appropriations subcommittee in the House and has been an outspoken critic of university spending.

Earlier this year, Fine drew attention for talking about shutting down UCF for a period of years as punishment for misusing at least $38 million in state funds to build the new Trevor Colburn Hall on campus.

Fine later walked back the remarks, calling them “hyperbole.” But UCF acknowledged redirecting the dollars for construction from instruction, research and other programs and university president Dale Whittaker resigned under withering criticism from state lawmakers.

While the focus has been sharpest on UCF, the University of Florida has confirmed opening an internal investigation into its use of several million dollars in state money to construct the Center of Outdoor and Recreation Education and clear woods to build three Greek housing lots, according to a whistleblower complaint sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis’s office and to the Department of Education.

USF officials admitted they misused $6.4 million of state operating funds on a building completed in 2010.

The questions surrounding spending has bolstered the push by the House to reduce dollars this year, which Fine said during an Appropriations Committee on Wednesday comes only after state funding to universities was boosted by $1.1 billion over the past five years.

Universities also are sitting on fund balances that top $1 billion, Fine said.

“We have over-appropriated more money than needed,” Fine told the House budget panel.

The House proposal also tightens dollars for campus construction projects, allowing UF, for example, to use $50 million of its fund balance to complete construction of a data science and information technology building but ending future funding for renovations to the on-campus music building.

The House budget blueprint includes tighter restrictions on construction projects planned for FSU, UCF, USF and state colleges.

House budget chief Travis Cummings, R-Orange Park, said after his side approved an $89.9 billion budget — and the Senate OK’d a $90.3 billion version — that negotiations between the sides will dominate the second half of the legislative session.

“I think higher ed and K-12 are clearly going to be a couple of issues where negotiation and debate is going to occur between the House and Senate. That’s very apparent ,” Cummings said.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190331/money-for-colleges-battleground-between-florida-house-and-senate?rssfeed=true,2019-03-31T19:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748

Jania Kadar and her friend were cleaning up in the backyard after a gathering of friends in eastern Tallahassee when the night sky lit up.

“It was like someone turned on the stadium lights,” the Tallahassee resident said. “I look up and there is this bluish green flash. It almost looks like daylight.”

“It lasted it felt like seconds,” she said of the sighting near midnight. “The second my brain wanted me to say ‘what is that?’, it was over…”

What Kadar saw was actually a meteor or meteorite that streaked across the sky and was visible in parts of South Georgia and North Florida. The fireball was caught by night owls, dash cams and surveillance videos across the region.

“It basically has a global lightning mapper and picks out bright cloud flashes from lightning when we have thunderstorms,” said Kelly Godsey, a NWS meteorologist.

1180,"Chocolate OK, but Easter reading gives kids some real nutrition","""Love Monsters"" by Summer DeSalvo (Photo: Submitted photo)

Candy will be gone — and your kids will stop bouncing off the walls, thank goodness — three days after they break into those Easter baskets. A book, on the other hand, will be with them for months, possibly years.

Those of us who can't imagine an Easter without the peanut butter egg and a rainbow of Peeps aren't advocating you skip the candy altogether. Bur a little less candy and a little more food for the mind and heart could balance this holiday a lot better.

And you don't have to look far to find good ideas. Southwest Florida has at least a dozen children's authors with books accessible at Barnes & Noble or via Amazon. (And they all look great with a pastel bow.)

Children's books abound from local authors

Here are a just few that look great packaged into that basket.

The ""No Sniveling"" series: (Skunk Hollow Publishing; prices vary with or without accessories) Sniveling's kind of a grumpy, grouchy, whiny behavior"" that the books tend to point out doesn't work,"" said Shirley DeLong, the Naples half of the writing team that wrote a three-book series."" It (the series) teaches us that accidents happen: There's no sniveling.""

DeLong and Lauren DeLong, her daughter, who lives in York, Maine, took their book plans one step further than most, creating some floppy-eared characters to go with the books. Each of them — Floppidy Loppidy, Bepoppidly Loppidy and Wadcliff Wabbit — have some challenge to overcome. Floppidy Loppidy, the original rabbit, is plagued by long, droopy ears that make him the butt of his friends' jokes and manage to pick up the paint he's using on Easter eggs and leave it everywhere else, too.

The rabbit finally finds his calling — thanks to those floor-dragging ears — as a listener for the Easter bunny, reporting back on good behaviors around the world. Shirley DeLong says the stuffed animal of Floppidy Loppidy can be an incentive for better behavior.

""It's kind of like 'The Elf on the Shelf.' After the elf goes back to the North Pole after Christmas, this little guy comes, and he watches and listens,"" Shirley DeLong said.

The rabbit can be moved and hidden at night, much as the elf is, to give youngsters a sense that the character is actually making rounds.

Alternately, however, kids can just play with them, and that's where the DeLongs have found the big-eared.

""I've gotten notes from little children — well, really from their parents — about how they are a security blanket, and please could they buy a couple more of just the rabbits,"" DeLong said. That's possible, although the two do like to sell the set, at least to begin with: The books apparently don't get lost or ruined as easily as the stuffed animals.

Bepoppidly, the female rabbit, teaches determination, in the second book; and Wadcliff Wabbit, as one can expect, is ""r"" challenged and wears huge spectacles. He has to work beyond bullying children and proves himself with ingenuity.

The first of the series won a the duo a ""Mom's Choice Honoring Excellence"" award at the 2011 New York Festival of Books. And all of them have been kid-tested on Lauren DeLong's own two children, who were perfect for the challenge

""We used to call them Thunder and Lightning,"" joked Shirley DeLong. But her daughter, she said, knew children's language, ""and she knows what makes them laugh and giggle.""

The books are meant to appeal to 3-year-olds ""probably until they don't believe in Santa any more,"" she said. Parents can read them to the child, and then the children can begin.

As a former Pottstown, Pennsylvania, teacher and loving little people and loving children's literature, DeLong said, ""it just came into my head."" On a beach vacation, she ""started scribbling,"" and when, she talked to her daughter, Lauren said, ""I think we can do this."" She designed the animals, and the two were on their way.

For those who are less into rabbits, the pair have written ""Zap 'A' Monster,"" the tale of a group of friends trying to perfect a repellent. Of course, it comes with a lavender-spearmint spritzer of — what else? — monster repellent. There are a few spelling challenges with ""lavender"" and ""pulley"" for the parent with a new speller can use as a teachable moment.

The books are available at amazon.com.

""Love Monsters"": (Self-published; $20 list) Bonita Springs resident Summer DeSalvo a professional graphics artist, was tasked with creating kid-friendly monsters. She fell in love with the critters, she said As she wrote in her introduction, ""I came up with the idea to make the book about the monsters under your bed and how they actually love you and you shouldn't be afraid of them.

""They just look a little different but really live a life just like us,"" she wrote. True to that, the little monsters in her book have sleepovers, get their heart-shaped hair ends trimmed and even get sent to time-out for bad behavior.

Because DeSalvo is an illustrator, she paid special attention to the colors — the only white is in the text: ""I hand-painted all of the pages with bright gouache paint, making them stand out and be presented as playful,"" she explained in an email.

Will the love monsters get a sequel? DeSalvo didn't say, but her ""Love Monsters"" have plenty to do now, ""helping children with the monsters under their bed and giving them new 'friends' to read about.""

The book is available at Barnes & Noble Booksellers in Naples or via Amazon.

Book idea took flight

""Owl Be Home for Christmas"": (Mascot Books; $14.95) Although an Easter basket may be a strange place for a Christmas story, Naples resident Maggie Gadsby's story is one of those rare kids' books about World War II. That's an especially relevant topic as the the 75th anniversary of D-Day approaches June 6.

This colorfully illustrated book creates an owl family with a father who's entrusted with flying intelligence information over the English Channel because, for one thing, owls fly at night, and second, they have muscular legs that might well hold a message to be delivered behind enemy lines.

The courier owl concept isn't historically real, emphasizes the Chicago-born Gadsby. But the locations and the history information surrounding D-Day are, giving it a grounding in authenticity, she said.

Gadsby set the story in England because so much of the Allied offensive was based there. And its veteran RAF owl even finds himself a war casualty, in the hospital for a ragged message-carrying talon. It's a good book for parents, or grandparents, and children to read together for discussion.

""I really wanted something that told young children about the war,"" said Gadsby. She came up with the idea after watching a family of owls, give birth and train their young to fly atop her own building in Naples.

It was a one-time inspiration with the owls, she lamented: ""The owner put an owl statue on top of the building to keep actual owls away.""

But she's bonded with her hooter family of Ollie, Mollie and Holly, and young readers may not have seen the last of them.

The book is available at Barnes & Noble Booksellers in Naples and online. Because there are several books with that title, specify the author in the search function.

1181,"Caught on camera: Burglar smashes glass, ransacks bedroom","Their doors were locked, the alarm was set, the dogs on guard, but an intruder got in anyway.

A couple believes they've been victimized by a serial burglar targeting the Treasure Coast.

According to the Sarah, the homeowner, the crook got inside the house with a small window breaker device and a precious family heirloom was stolen.

He used it to shatter the glass on the sliding glass door on the patio.

“It’s absolutely devastating,” Sarah said.

Sarah doesn't want CBS12 News to show her face because the burglar who came into her house is still out there and hasn’t been caught.

Their home surveillance camera got video of the guy when he broke the glass on their sliding glass door about 5:15 Friday night and entered the house.

“He kinda just stood sideways and put this thing up against the glass and then you just heard it pop really loud,” Sarah said.

She showed us a photo, showing he made a hole in the glass big enough to climb through.

Once inside, surveillance video shows it only took him six minutes for him to ransack the master bedroom.

Photos show the mess left behind as he searched for valuables.

He took more than a dozen men’s watches, cash, gift cards and an antique gold pocket watch that belonged to Sarah’s great-grandfather. She says the stolen items are worth about $4,500.



Sarah is still shaken watching the surveillance video.

“It’s beyond scary to sit here and watch this,"" she said. ""I’ve seen it 100 times and my heart flutters every time I watch it.""

Sarah says the burglar left shoe prints in the sand behind her home. She feels he had a lookout in a car nearby because he left the house just as she got home from work.

She says the intruder stole her valuables and her peace of mind.

“That’s very scary. I feel my sense of security is gone, I don’t feel safe in my home anymore,” Sarah said.

Her advice? Get some accordion storm shutters for your patio door so you can prevent anyone from breaking the glass and coming inside when you’re not there.

Sarah says they plan to add extra cameras and upgrade their alarm system.",http://cw34.com/news/local/caught-on-camera-burglar-smashes-glass-ransacks-bedroom,2019-04-17T02:37:20Z,WTVX,Couple,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407

- Florida has more golf courses than any other state in the country. But a couple of them here in the Bay Area aren't well known. They are on the grounds of MacDill Air Force Base.

The two golf courses at the Bay Palm Golf Complex are both par 72 and anyone with access to the base can play on them.

""Anyone with a Department of Defense ID card or their guest,"" said Bay Palm Complex general manager Lou Harris. ""So pretty much anybody that can pass the background check, the vetting that they do to get people on base, they can play golf here.""

But each Wednesday, from noon until 1, the driving range is reserved for active duty military personnel and their spouses for free golf lessons.

When FOX 13 News stopped by on a recent Wednesday, Air Force Reserves Maj. Bill Kerr was getting some tips on taking the slice out of his swing from assistant manager Dave Stewart.

""It's nice to come out, hit a few balls and see what they can teach us,"" said Maj. Kerr. ""There's a lot of knowlegable guys out here so it's a great bonus we get, to get this hour on Wednesdays for free.""

The clinic gives them a chance to put their stressful jobs aside and focus on their swing.

""Hopefully they get some relaxation,"" said Harris. ""We're not putting our lives on the line out here. There's nobody bleeding, there's nobody shooting at us. So we can enjoy ourselves a little bit. That's where golf comes in. That's the game of a lifetime.""

1185,Parkinson’s 101: Relationships help keep you on the right path,"Parkinson's support groups are a great way to find people dealing with the issues you might be going through. (Photo: vm, Getty Images)

April is Parkinson's Disease Awareness Month. Each week in April we will feature a column breaking down different aspects of Parkinson's.

Parkinson’s disease can take over life if we let it.

Upon diagnosis it is impossible to predict how much the disease will take away from us. A few are embarrassed and keep it a secret (even from their own families).

Marieke Kreps was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease at age 63. (Photo: Provided)

Younger onset patients are concerned about losing their jobs and not being able to support their loved ones.

Others succumb to apathy and don’t have the enthusiasm or desire to do what they used to do and hide away. A few just give up on life.

This is when a support group becomes important. There are seven support groups here in Brevard County: The Fountains in Palm Bay; One Senior Place in Suntree; the Central Brevard Library in Cocoa; a care partner support group at the Melbourne Yacht Club; a care partner support group at the Central Brevard Library; Parish Medical Center in Titusville; and Greenwood Place, formally Brookdale assisted living, in Melbourne.

Each group has its own personality but they all are confidential and educational with members all on the journey living life as well as possible with Parkinson’s.

Sharing is a large part of the group dynamic. No one knows Parkinson’s better than someone diagnosed with Parkinson’s.

When we attend a support group meeting we know we are not alone, can ask questions, share ideas, share experiences and be heard and understood.

A bonus is special speakers, experts in their fields that bring good information for better care.

After the presentation the group breaks up into smaller groups to either discuss the topic of the day or ask and answer one another’s questions. For information go to www.brevardparkinsosg.org.

Rock Steady boxing classes (one of the best workouts for Parkinson’s) are support groups as well.

Classmates get to know each other very well when working out, sweating together and cheering one another on to push ourselves to finish the exercises. It is team spirit at its best.

More: 'BIG' treatment helps slow Parkinson's effects

There are two centers in Melbourne for Rock Steady boxing, Advance Fitness in Melbourne and Unlimited Kickboxing in Merritt Island.

The Brevard Parkinson’s Support Group offers scholarships for anyone needing help to afford these classes. The classes meet two to three times a week whereas the support groups meet only once a month.

Family dynamics are another issue.

Couples have challenges because many times the roles are changed depending upon which one is diagnosed. The husband may have to pitch in and clean the house or cook meals.

The wife may end up handling all the finances and bills or vice versa, or even everything.

Allowing the Parkinson’s person to continue to do what he/she can do is important and sometimes becomes an area of contention.

Not every couple survives the realization that life will not get any better. But those who hang on to one another through the rollercoaster ride have an intimacy that can only be found when challenged and committed to care and love one another.

Children learn to pitch in and grow up empathetic to disabilities and compassionate. Unfortunately when these relationships suffer it is hard to find counselors who work with families affected by this disease.

The support groups can help with information from the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation and their own experiences. (info@pdf.org)

Maintaining friendships is important.

Going out to dinner or a party is a good thing for anyone. One of the symptoms of Parkinson’s is the blank wide-eyed look on one’s face. It is called the Parkinson’s mask.

Not everyone has this symptom. Many times strangers assume we might have dementia or that something is wrong. This can make us feel uncomfortable.

Eating becomes a challenge when the disease progresses and going out becomes a matter of determination. Most people are very nice once they understand. Isolation produces depression.

Probably the most important earthly relationship we have is the one with ourselves.

We can sit around and have our own pity party or we can hitch up our bootstraps and decide we will make the best of it and fight with dignity to maintain quality of life.

We have to learn we will have good days when we can’t believe we have Parkinson’s and then we have bad days with no energy and we know we have Parkinson’s.

Maintaining a positive outlook is very important, but easier said than done. It’s also a matter of deciding what we can do to help ourselves and be a source of help to others.

Michael J. Fox is the example of taking his diagnosis and turning it into the most productive foundation for research.

His determination to make a difference is an inspiration for us all. Now every Parkinson’s patient has an opportunity to be part of the research by joining Fox Insight (a data base of information) where scientists and researchers can gather information to help them develop new medications and hopefully a cure. (www.michaeljfox.org)

Spiritual beliefs and faith in God strengthen many of us to face each day. We try to practice gratitude and count each day a blessing.

Nothing buoys a spirit more than making an effort to encourage someone else and let them know you are thinking of them.

Attending church and worship can be an anchor to endure the changes and challenges. It is as important to maintain contact with other human beings as it is to exercise. Communication and a hug are medicine for the soul.

Marieke Kreps is the President of Brevard Parkinson’s Support Group and Parkinson’s Foundation Ambassador for Aware in Care Foundation.

1186,North Port foster dad accused of sexual abuse stands trial today,"Gilberto Rios and his wife have fostered 48 children since 2009

SARASOTA — A 64-year-old North Port foster parent stands trial today for the alleged sexual and physical abuse of a 3-year-old girl back in 2015.

Last year, the child reportedly told her adoptive mother that Gilberto Rios forced his penis into her mouth, triggering a police investigation.

In an interview with investigators in April 2018, the girl said Rios “took my hand and pulled me over there,” unzipped his pants, then told her to put her mouth on his penis, according to a transcript obtained from court files related to the case.

Afterwards, she ran to her room and locked the door, the child told investigators.

Rios, who has pleaded not guilty and opted for trial, has fostered 48 children with his wife since they became licensed foster parents in 2009, according to child welfare officials.

His wife, Nereida, has not been charged.

But the allegations of sexual and physical abuse are not the first to be made against the Rios family.

GateHouse Media has identified at least four more suspected victims through public records and court documents. None are being named to protect their privacy.

In 2016, a biological mother complained to the Department of Children & Families that her two daughters had been sexually and physically abused while in the couple's care. But DCF could not substantiate the complaint and continued to send vulnerable foster children to the couple for more than a year.

Then in 2018, suspicions of abuse surfaced again with regard to a young child whom Rios and his wife adopted. The boy began disclosing disturbing stories to caseworkers after his father’s arrest last year, according to a former case manager for the Safe Children Coalition.

And Monday, the adoptive mother of yet another child previously fostered by the Rios family said she also fears her daughter was sexually abused.

The Sarasota YMCA/Safe Children Coalition, the nonprofit agency contracted by the Department of Children and Families to manage the child welfare system in Sarasota County, did not answer questions about how many abuse allegations have been filed against Rios over the years or why he and his wife were allowed to continue fostering after the initial allegations were made in 2016.

In an email, Steve Hurwitz, the attorney for the agency, said simply that DCF handles child abuse investigations in Sarasota County.

He added that the Rios foster home was “closed” the day Rios was arrested in April 2018.

The Florida Department of Children and Families did not return multiple requests for comment.

Gilberto Rios’ defense attorney Jeffrey Young also declined to comment on the case Friday.

But before jury selection on Monday, he and fellow defense attorney Betsy Young argued that allegations by children, especially those who have been through other trauma, are susceptible to false memories and embellishment through repeated questioning.

A database of foster care placements obtained by GateHouse Media shows that Rios and his wife often fostered five or six children at a time and were licensed to accept traditional foster kids under the age of 5 as well as medically needy foster children. The records also show that the couple was paid an average of $1,512 per month from 2013 through 2017 for foster services.

The database may be closed to the public next year because of a bill making its way through the Florida Legislature that would make the names of all foster parents a secret.

DCF worked with legislators to craft the proposal after GateHouse Media and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune made a public records request last year asking for the names of all licensed foster parents in the state.

Rios will now stand trial in Sarasota County Circuit Court following an investigation that began in April 2018. That’s when the adoptive mother of one of his former foster children noticed the girl simulating oral sex with Barbie dolls.

When questioned, the girl said that she had once “bit” someone’s penis, according to court documents. Later, on her way to a therapy appointment, she revealed that person was Rios, police in North Port said.

According to police, the girl’s adoptive mother immediately reported the allegations to authorities, who interviewed the child on April 12, 2018.

Police arrested Rios later that night and charged him with sexual assault against a child. He bonded out on $200,000 the next day, court records show.

During the course of the investigation, North Port Police Department detective Shannon Fortuno also learned of a previous allegation made against Rios in 2016. Fortuno noted in court documents that investigators conducted a medical exam in that case, but did not conduct a forensic interview, “possibly due to the age of the child.”

In an interview Friday, the mother of that child said she believes both of her daughters — then 2 and 3 — were molested by Rios.

She started to suspect abuse after noticing her daughters showing up for visits with cuts and bruises on their lips and buttocks. Her 3-year-old later began bleeding from her vagina and developed a yeast infection, according to the mother, whose name is being withheld to protect her children’s identities.

When asked about the injuries, her daughter “said she couldn’t tell me because she would go to jail or not be able to go home to Mommy,” the mother said.

She added that child welfare officials ignored her requests to have her daughter forensically interviewed to determine the veracity of her statements.

“Everybody kept getting ignored,” she said. “Emails, calls — it was ignored.”

After Hurricane Irma, she moved her and her daughters out of the state.

“My (daughter) is not even potty trained because she’s terrified of the toilet from when she was dunked into the toilet by Mr. and Mrs. Rios,” she said. “If I try to cut (my daughter) an apple, she screams out, please don’t cut the baby.”

Since she made her report, child welfare officials in Sarasota placed at least 10 foster children with the Rios family, according to the database obtained by GateHouse.

A former case manager with the Safe Children Coalition who asked that her name be withheld because of fears of retribution said the state’s investigation into the alleged abuse was inconclusive.

Despite the uncertainty, she said officials often continue to send children to homes with previous abuse allegations because of the severe shortage of available foster homes.

“There’s been foster homes which were less than stellar that we’ve had concerns about and they keep using them because, ‘Oh, well, they take the hard kids,'"" she said.

The former case manager said that’s also when concerns cropped up about the couple’s adopted son, who began disclosing stories to caseworkers about “how he would go to Daddy’s room and they would have candy and have special time together,” she said.

“We had serious concerns that the mother was grooming the child.”

But legal efforts to temporarily remove the adoptive son from the home were turned down by Judge Rochelle Curley last year, according to two sources familiar with the case. It is unknown whether the child remains in the home.

Other people who took in children previously fostered by Rios also expressed concerns, including one mother who adopted her daughter out of the system in 2017.

After more than two decades as a foster parent, specializing in children with medical needs, she said it was the worst case she’d ever seen. The 2-year-old girl could not walk, talk or eat on her own. She looked as if she’d never seen the sun. The child was underweight and vomited profusely.

The mother, whom GateHouse is not naming to protect her child’s identity, feared her daughter had been abused.

“She was just so terrified of public restrooms, our bathroom, any bathroom,” the mother said. “You could see the sheer terror in her eyes.”

She said it took years for the child to gain trust in her as a mother. During bath time, the little girl would cover her privates, and scream “please, Mommy, no.”

“I had to tell her 100 times a day, I will never hurt you,” she said. “I don’t know by whom, but I can guarantee you, that child was abused.”

The adoptive mother was surprised to learn from GateHouse Media reporters that her daughter spent six months under Rios’ care as an infant in 2015, before later spending time with at least four other temporary caregivers.

The state never contacted her about the allegations against Rios.

“They don’t do the responsible thing,” she said. “It’s all supposed to be what’s in the best interest of the child. But it’s not. It’s what’s in the best interest of the agency.”

“The system is so broken. It makes me want to cry. Our most vulnerable children are being preyed upon.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190416/north-port-foster-dad-accused-of-sexual-abuse-stands-trial-today?rssfeed=true,2019-04-16T07:01:59Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

(AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)

BOSTON (AP) — Actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, are pleading not guilty to charges they took part in the sweeping college admissions bribery scam, according to court documents filed Monday.

The couple is accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as crew recruits, even though neither is a rower.

They were among 50 people charged last month in the scandal that has embroiled elite school across the country, including Stanford, Georgetown and Yale.

Loughlin, who played Aunt Becky on the sitcom “Full House,” and Giannulli haven’t publicly addressed the allegations against them.

Loughlin and Giannulli said in the court documents that they waived their right to appear in Boston federal court for their arraignment and plead not guilty to the two charges against them. The judge must approve their request not to appear to formally enter their pleas.

Thirty-three wealthy parents were charged in what authorities have called the biggest college admissions case ever prosecuted by the Justice Department.

The parents are accused of paying admissions consultant Rick Singer to rig standardized test scores and bribe college coaches and other insiders to get their children into selective schools.

Fellow actress Felicity Huffman, who starred in ABC’s “Desperate Housewives” and 12 other parents announced last week that they have agreed to plead guilty to a single charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Huffman is scheduled to appear in Boston on May 21 to enter her plea.

Prosecutors added a money laundering conspiracy charge against Loughlin, Giannulli and more than a dozen other parents who are still fighting the case, increasing the pressure on them to plead guilty.

Several other parents who were indicted alongside Loughlin and Giannulli last week have also filed court documents entering not guilty pleas.

1191,Neighbors in Moncrief say city hasn't picked up tree debris in 2 weeks,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - People living in a Moncrief neighborhood said they have been trying to get the city to pick up debris from a tree removal for the past two weeks to no avail.

""It is an eyesore because it makes the neighborhood look bad,"" said Ted Walker, who's lived in the neighborhood for 30 years.

Joe Glenn takes care of the yard where the tree limbs are piled up.

""I keep the yard up and everything. I called the city three times to come and remove it, but evidently, they don’t care. They never came and removed it. They pick up small piles but leave the big pile,"" Glenn said. ""People have complained about the sidewalk and everything, but it’s out of my hands, you know.""

News4Jax called the city Sunday, which sent crews out to look at the logs. A city spokesperson said even though the logs from the tree are larger than what the city accepts, the logs will be removed Monday morning.

That will be a big relief for people who live in the area.

""We do a good job around here trying to keep the area groomed and nice, but yeah, that’s been an eyesore for a couple of weeks now,"" said Walker.

If you have yard waste that is not being picked up, you can call the city at 904-630-CITY.

1193,Toxic algae: Cache of Florida Department of Health emails show an agency struggling to manage a growing crisis,"With toxic algae fouling Southwest Florida’s inland waterways and coastline last year, state health officials faced a flood of worried questions as people turned to them for crisis leadership.

Some were specific: Were Caloosahatchee blue crabs safe to eat? Was it dangerous to breathe near the algae-choked canals? How about swimming in the Gulf?

Others were systemic: Who posts warning signs? Was any agency monitoring illness reports? Would water and air be tested for toxins?

As red tide devastated wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico from Sarasota to the Ten Thousand Islands, a simultaneous outbreak of blue-green algae contaminated the Caloosahatchee watershed. Images of bloated dolphin carcasses and people jet-boating through algae blooms filled news reports. Social media seethed with rumors and petitions. Former Gov. Rick Scott declared two states of emergency - one for each bloom.

Yet through it all, the Florida Department of Health stayed largely in the background. It refused The News-Press' interview requests and delayed responding or outright ignored emailed questions. To try to understand its internal workings, The News-Press obtained more than 2,500 emails from May 25 to Sept. 26. They reveal a hunkered-down agency scrambling to keep its message straight as the environmental calamity deepened.

Since then, the department hasn't responded to a number of requests made over multiple weeks for an interview that might offer insight into the department’s stance throughout the crisis and its future goals. That invitation is still open.

The public records request sought correspondence from the two officials whose names appeared in the infrequent press releases the department issued about the situation: Kendra Goff, state toxicologist and chief of the Bureau of Environmental Health, and Andy Reich, scientific adviser for the bureau. Each of the 2,661 emails was reviewed by the department’s legal team and sensitive information redacted. What remains in the cache, which The News-Press is still analyzing, chronicles a range of concerns. When worried citizens, persistent reporters and other government entities turned to the agency for guidance, they often came away with more questions than answers.

Ability, capacity and responsibility: Which agency does what?

Responsibilities and runarounds were common topics, even when officials from other agencies wrote the department. In August, for example, the Department of Environmental Protection’s John Calhoun asked about hot spot air testing: ”We are getting lots of calls from citizens requesting air testing around ponds with algae blooms. We usually refer to the County, who refer them to the local Health Dept, who refer them back to us and our Division of Air. Unfortunately, our Division of Air only does static monitoring of specific locations and doesn’t have the equipment to do local testing like that. Does DOH have any ability & capacity to do such localized air testing?”

Goff answered: “Unfortunately, we do not have any capabilities to perform air testing, localized or not. For more information on harmful algal blooms, people can be directed to our website. In general, we advise folks to take precautions around water bodies that may have harmful algal blooms. Happy to chat further.”

When the public emailed with questions, officials didn't always answer. And when they did, some of their correspondents, like Ralph Quillen, found the exchanges frustrating.

Concerned for the health of his two young daughters, Quillen pressed Angela Smith, who administers Lee's health department, to tell him whether the island was safe for his girls. She responded with generalities and gave him some informational links. They went back and forth a couple of times until Quillen had enough.

He repeatedly contacted the Florida Department of Health during the red tide/cyanobacteria crisis and was not satisfied with the answers he got from them. (Photo: Andrew West, The News-Press USA Today Network-Florida)

""Thank you for your response but you did not answer my question. Is it safe for my family to live in these conditions with these algae blooms and this red tide?"" he wrote. ""Why can't I get a straight answer?""

After that, Smith didn't write back.

Dagmar and Steve Martin, who live on a dead-end Cape Coral canal contacted the department in July about the algae's foul smell. ""We are permanent residents and have no other place to stay. We don't know how toxic the algae is ... We are hoping to get help as soon as possible!”

The email wound up in Reich's queue; but he did not write the Martins back.

Aug. 22, 2018, Pam Cox sent the department what she called a plea ""to acknowledge the conditions with the Red Tide/Blue Green Algae crisis. Your website and silence on the current health situation is gross negligence ... PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ... whoever is monitoring this mailbox, bring it forward to others in your office. Don't just send an automated reply and delete it.""

Reich wrote back: “Dear Ms. Cox Thank you for your email to Florida Department of Health. The Department's role in responding to red tide events relates to health concerns. You can find information on health effects of algal blooms on our website. Sincerely, Andrew Reich""

Aug. 17, JoEllyn Bavosa wrote asking ""When will you help? When will you start testing? When will you issue warnings to the public about Cyanobacteria? This is not just Red Tide anymore and has not been for a very long time. With hope that your agency will step forward and help.”

Reich didn’t write Bavosa back, but he did send a colleague this: “There really is nothing we can say to address this email. Andy.”

Other correspondence included:

► Reich’s response about whether freshly hunted alligator meat from an area of bloom is safe to eat: “It’s my best guess that the toxins would not accumulate in the muscle tissue but without data, there is no way of knowing for sure.”

► Goff telling epidemiology department chief, physician Russell Eggert, July 12, “We would like to discuss how we are going to handle these inquiries and we will need some help. We are not used to this volume of inquiries.”

► Martin County environmentalist and former commissioner Maggy Hurchalla writing: “This is Florida’s Flint, Michigan – ignoring a problem because it is too scary and difficult to deal with.”

► And in one of Goff’s email threads, Martin County Commissioner Ed Fielding wrote presciently: “It portends to be a long, disastrous summer.”

Internally, officials repeatedly emphasized the need for a unified front.

In July, after then-Gov. Scott declared a state of emergency,Eggert, the epidemiology chief, asked Reich if the declaration should be discussed during a regular conference call with the epidemiology staff of the state's county health departments.

""Yes,"" answered Reich. ""I think the issue of health impacts might become more important. Should (epidemiology and environmental health departments) discuss together to make sure we have a consistent approach? ""

In August, Reich convened a phone conference with county health leaders and spokespeople statewide to “facilitate coordination and consistent messaging.”

Once warning signage became a source of concern, the department changed course. In June, it told a News-Press reporter that signs were not its responsibility. Then in August, it told the same reporter “We’ve posted hundreds of signs.”

The reporter responded: ""Back in June, I started asking the local DOH about just that, and was told in no uncertain terms that posting blue-green algae warning signs is not the department’s role. Attached please find emails saying just that, and contradicting what you wrote. So, I’m not sure who’s mistaken here, but I’d like to know what the case is.""

Spokesman Brad Dalton later wrote back: ""After speaking with the county office I believe the issue is that the work done in the community concerning signage was performed after the communication between you two.""

In their emails, department officials regularly discussed media coverage both local and national – from The Wall Street Journal to The New York Times, with Reich expressing relief that he hadn’t appeared in a Times story. “Glad my name didn’t show up,” he wrote a colleague.

They criticized some of the local stories. After a TV segment appeared, Goff wrote: “It is a shame that we can be misquoted so easily. No wonder we get the calls that we do from citizens confused on this topic. Angela, you and I have chatted about those challenges and sometimes backfiring with the media even if we are trying to provide the most accurate and current scientific information. Totally understand it's sometimes beyond our control how the Department is quoted. I think we are only seeing the beginning of this if this article is any indication.”

Shortly after one of The News-Press' stories about the department came out, one official included this comment with an online link: “FYI This article does not portray FL DOH in a positive light.”

Bloom season approaches: What's been done; what's left to do

As the next steamy summer season approaches, the potential for more outbreaks looms and it's unclear how the department would handle another crisis

A number of its key positions are vacant – a recently requested organizational chart shows no surgeon general, chief of staff or head of the legislative planning office.

Some of its approaches have changed since last year.

It's rolled out an informational web page on cyanobacteria, it's ramped up its outreach on aquatic toxins and it appears it's now taking responsibility for posting warning signs.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has called for a harmful algal blooms task force and emphasized a science-based approach to fighting toxic algae outbreaks, but his office hasn't answered calls or emails asking about the administration’s goals for the health department.

A patchwork of nonprofits, educational institutions and citizen initiatives are filling the leadership void. FGCU and Florida Atlantic University quickly received emergency funding to study the potential health effects of cyanobacteria. Lee Health began collecting data from its patients about exposure to blooms and symptoms. Several social media groups disseminate news and outbreak information. And Calusa Waterkeeper got a grant from the Southwest Florida Community Foundation specifically to do what the department hasn't: engage with health care workers and decision-makers about cyanobacteria's effects with a series of public events.

Calusa Waterkeeper John Cassani offered a to-do list he'd like to see the department tackle that includes:

Raising the the department's public profile in the media so that people can easily determine potential health risks from exposure to algae

Increasing the number of monitoring stations for airborne algal toxins.

Posting comprehensive toxin concentrations and health guidelines about various forms of exposure in cooperation with Florida Department of Environmental Protection waterbody monitoring

Establishing a clear policy on how and when health advisories will be made; including signage guidelines

Creating a citizen hotline on the blooms

Developing an interagency public health working group to advise the department on the most current information about health effects of blooms.

To Whom It May Concern

After a three-week vacation in early August, health coach Ralph Quillen had returned home to Sanibel to find the island hemmed in by red tide, as toxic cyanobacteria flowed down the Caloosahatchee.

Alarmed, Quillen wrote city government – “I need to know if it is safe for my family, specifically my 3 and 6 year old girls to live in these conditions” – and was directed to the Lee County branch of the Florida Department of Health.

His question was simple: “Is it safe for my family to live on Sanibel in these conditions?”

Angela Smith, who administers Lee's health department, wrote back: “We are not aware of any long term negative effects of red tide. For most people, symptoms are temporary and resolve when the person leaves the proximity of the impacted water. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on your family specifically due to the fact that K. brevis impacts individuals so differently. Some individuals experience “red tide tickle” while others do not. Still other individuals with existing pulmonary issues may experience more severe reactions.I would encourage you to speak with your healthcare provider if you have specific questions regarding your family’s health.”

Quillen replied: “Hello Angela, Thank you for your response but you did not answer my question. Is it safe for my family to live in these conditions with these algae blooms and this red tide? We have over 100 children on Sanibel and the island is surrounded with this poison. Should the school be handing out filter masks? What are the long term effects? Will this affect our children's health in the future. Why can't I get a straight answer?”

Smith wrote back to tell him, among other things, that ""For sensitive individuals, wearing a particle filter mask may lessen the effects, and over-the-counter antihistamines decrease symptoms."" She also referred him to the Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and to Mote Marine's online beach report.

By now, Quillen said, he was getting frustrated. “Hi Angela, Thanks for your response but I think I am going to have ask this question again. It is a yes or no question. Is my family safe to live on this island? Is the air safe? Also, has Lee county been running air quality tests? Are the tests available to review? Have you been out to the island to see the devastation? … I look forward to your response.”

But after that, Smith never responded, even though she blind-copied Quillen’s emails up the chain of command until they reached Reich.

Quillen's conclusion?. “The emails speak for themselves. They basically did nothing. And we’re still left with no answers.""

The News-Press repeatedly queried the department as well, even finding an email this reporter had sent to a university professor (who doesn't work at the department) about the department’s ongoing silence in Reich’s queue: “I’ve had a devil of a time communicating with the Florida Department of Health. Among other things, I’ve been asking about whether local fish catches are being monitored or tested, as well as non-fin fish seafood, especially blue crabs. Most importantly, though, I wanted them to tell me if there’s any kind of epidemiologic surveillance plan in place – or being discussed – for short- and long-term human health impacts, whether it’s something the DOH would do, or if not what agency would.” His receipt of the email notwithstanding, Reich never responded to her.

Other citizens who wrote got shorter responses – if they got any. Here are some excerpts:

July 11, Dagmar and Steve Martin of Cape Coral wrote:

“We live at the end of a canal … The algae's smell really bad. We can't sit outside or even work in the backyard … The smell is already in the house. We are concerned about our health. It's impossible to live like that! There are small children living in the neighborhood as well. We are permanent residents and have no other place to stay. We don't know how toxic the algae is. We experience a dry and scratchy throat and believe it has to do with the bad smell. We don't know if there are injured or dead fish or other wild life. We are hoping to get help as soon as possible!”

No return email was included in the public records The News-Press received.

Aug. 17, JoEllyn Bavosa wrote:

“As a resident of Florida for over 20 years it is a huge concern of mine to find that our waters have not and are not being tested for Cyanobacteria. As we are NOW in a state of emergency and our canals, bays and gulf are filled with ""green slime"" and our marine life is dead or dying, I was wondering when exactly we would start testing for Cyanobacteria and the toxin it releases? I have asked our local Sarasota Board of Health and the response was and still is, we only test what we are told to test. Another concern is that the County and State Officials make it perfectly clear that our beaches are open, and have never closed, and ""sure you can go out there, however I would not."" (City of Sarasota 6/16/18 video) When questions are asked of our ""Officials,"" they refer us to Mote marine, who does not even staff a Cyanobacteria specialist or to your Department. Cyanobacteria, as I am sure you are aware, risks the very health, lives and water we drink, of the people exposed to it for prolonged periods of time. When will you help? When will you start testing? When will you issue warnings to the public about Cyanobacteria? This is not just Red Tide anymore and has not been for a very long time. With hope that your agency will step forward and help.”

No return email was included in the public records The News-Press received, but Reich did send a colleague this: “There really is nothing we can say to address this email. Andy.”

1194,Florida State exploring 3-4 to create more well-rounded defense,"Florida State's defense has looked a little different over the last two weeks of spring practice.

The Seminoles have been incorporating more of a 3-4 look than the traditional 4-3 defense FSU has employed over the years. A 3-4 has three defensive linemen and four linebackers while a 4-3 has four defensive linemen and three linebackers.

""It's just different looks,"" FSU defensive tackle Marvin Wilson said.

""Switching it up from what we normally do. Give teams different looks instead of coming out in that same four-man front. We got to be able to be versatile, just expand your game. It adds more to your stock coming out, you know, different front, play different things, instead of just being in one front.""

The position groupings have seen a lot of change so far this spring.

Defensive tackles coach Odell Haggins took over the entire defensive line while defensive ends coach Mark Snyder took over special teams. Snyder was also expected to help out with linebackers.

He was doing so during Wednesday's practice when he was working with the stand-up rush linebackers/boundary defensive ends. Junior Leonard Warner, redshirt senior Adonis Thomas, and senior Josh Brown were working with Snyder in that capacity.

""I think that I do a good job of reading,"" Warner said.

""I have a decent feel for the position. I have good instincts and I have a good for where the play's 'gon go or where the tackle's 'gon set. I think I had a good couple pass rushes getting off the edge. Being able to bend. Just keeping it coming together as a d-end and just trying to keep coming together as a football player altogether.""

Senior Dontavious Jackson, redshirt sophomore DeCalon Brooks, and freshman Jaleel McRae were working with linebackers coach Raymond Woodie as inside linebackers. Hamsah Nasirildeen and Amari Gainer were working at the star linebacker position.

The boundary defensive ends/linebackers were working right along side the rest of the defensive line during practice.

""Really just some of the same things that we’re doing, we’re just doing it out of a different front,"" Wilson said.

""We just really came in, we’ve been real coachable this whole spring. Whatever coach wants, that’s what we’ve been giving to him. Whatever coach tells us to do, we’re going to do it. We’re going to do it full speed, we’re going to give him 100 percent.""

Why a 3-4 makes sense

It isn't yet clear if this is going to be a full-time change for the Seminoles, but if it is, it makes a lot of sense. FSU's personnel in the front-seven fits a 3-4 better than a 4-3 currently.

Defensive end Brian Burns is off to the NFL, and, with him gone, so is most of FSU's production at defensive end

The Seminoles return just four sacks -- three by junior Josh Kaindoh and one by redshirt junior Janarius Robinson -- from the defensive end position last season.

There aren't any truly great pass rushers on the roster currently.

Guys like Dennis Briggs, Malcolm Lamar, and Jamarcus Chatman should thrive in a 3-4 if that's what the Seminoles elect to go to full time. Incoming defensive linemen Curtis Fann and Malcolm Ray may also be better suited for a 3-4.

Even Robinson -- 6-foot-5, 261 pounds -- and Kaindoh -- 6-foot-7, 261 pounds -- have the size to play on the outside.

FSU also has defensive tackles like junior Marvin Wilson and redshirt sophomore Cory Durden that would fit right in on a three-man front. Wilson could play inside or out and Durden would fit well on the outside. Sophomore Robert Cooper would also be an excellent fit as a 3-4 nose tackle with his size and strength.

At linebacker, FSU has players capable of filling the roles. Jackson and McRae have the body types and ability to play well inside. Incoming linebacker Kevon Glenn should fit in well in that role as well.

Nasirildeen slid down from safety to the star position at the beginning of the spring and Gainer continues to work there. Incoming linebacker Kalen DeLoach will be working at the star. That position didn't seem to change from the 4-3 to the 3-4 during practice.

Boundary end/linebacker should find a home for Xavier Peters, who has been working as a defensive end, but is more of a linebacker. Peters has not been seen at the two open availability practices the last two weeks.

Josh Brown was primarily a pass rusher in high school. Warner apparently had a standout scrimmage in his new role. Incoming defensive end Derrick McLendon would likely fall into this role as well.

The move to a 3-4 could hide FSU's lack of an elite pass rusher and allow the Seminoles to be more creative in the way they got after the quarterback.

Jania Kadar and her friend were cleaning up in the backyard after a gathering of friends in eastern Tallahassee when the night sky lit up.

“It was like someone turned on the stadium lights,” the Tallahassee resident said. “I look up and there is this bluish-green flash. It almost looks like daylight.”

“It lasted it felt like seconds,” she said of the sighting near midnight. “The second my brain wanted me to say ‘what is that?’, it was over…”

What Kadar saw was actually a meteor or meteorite that streaked across the sky and was visible across a wide swath of South Georgia and North Florida. The fireball was caught by night owls, dash cams and surveillance videos across the region.

They also tracked social media reports from Valdosta, Georgia, Tallahassee, Wakulla County, Gainesville and Jacksonville.

For the Tallahassee area, it would have appeared as a brief 5 seconds of illumination between about 11:52 and 11:54 p.m., Godsey said. It may have even crashed to earth.

“We've heard reports that it landed near Perry, which would match with the GLM data, but can't confirm anything,” NWS tweeted. “The satellite data suggests that *if* it landed, though, it was in FL.”

That NWS confirmation was an ah-ha moment for Kadar Sunday morning. After the flash, she and her friend immediately began speculating, and even second guessing, what they saw.

“We had a couple of beers so there was that…” she said. “At the time, we were playing around with some pretty extraterrestrial theories. Of course, our husbands were oblivious. They were schlepping stuff in and out of the house.”

The moment even surprised those who have been looking up at the stars for years.

Andy Flower, who has been studying the sky for six years as a member of Tallahassee's Astronomical Society was packing up with a colleague after a night at the organization's observatory near the Cypress Landing boat ramp on Lake Miccosukee.

About 15 people had come out earlier to observe the new moon.

""Everyone had already left, and all of a sudden the whole sky lit up,"" he said.

Flower has seen dozens of meteors in his life, even two small ones earlier that night. But nothing like this.

""The whole area turned to daylight,"" he said. ""We were like 'what the ...? Is there a helicopter over us, a spotlight?' ""

""We looked up and saw a streak in the sky directly overhead that ended in a fireball about halfway to the horizon in the direction of the parking lot.""

It will be a night to remember and talk about for Flower, Kadar and others in the Big Bend.

“It was absolutely incredible,” Kadar said. “It was like a ball of energy that flew across the sky.”

1196,"Dollars for Florida universities, colleges emerge as battleground between House, Senate","TALLAHASSEE — With the resignation of the University of Central Florida’s president drawing scrutiny on spending problems at Florida universities, higher education dollars are emerging as a battleground for state House and Senate budget writers.

Dueling state spending blueprints set for votes this week in the House and Senate take vastly different approaches to financing Florida’s universities and colleges. The Senate spends $285.3 million more in a higher education budget topping $6 billion.

“We clearly have a lot of work to do to get the two sides together,” said Sen. Kelli Stargell, R-Lakeland, chair of the Senate Education budget panel.

The biggest clash between the two Republican-controlled chambers is over Florida’s 12 public universities, where the House proposes $100 million in across-the-board cuts — a 2.5 percent reduction — along with an additional $20 million drop in preeminence funding that goes to the University of Florida, Florida State University, the University of South Florida and the University of Central Florida.

Preeminence funding, an award aimed at encouraging research and student performance, currently amounts to $152 million for the schools. The 13 percent reduction would bring it down to its level in 2017-18, according to House leaders.

The Senate generally beefs-up dollars for university programs and projects.

The two sides do match up in some areas. Neither is calling for tuition hikes — which Gov. Ron DeSantis also opposes — and the House and Senate are seeking $69.7 million more for Bright Futures scholarships, basically to cover an anticipated 113,902 students.

Benacquisto Scholarships, which go to National Merit Scholars, also draw an additional $4.3 million in both budget proposals, bringing the program to $21.4 million for an expected 1,416 students.

Rep. Randy Fine, R-Palm Bay, chairs the Higher Education Appropriations subcommittee in the House and has been an outspoken critic of university spending.

Earlier this year, Fine drew attention for talking about shutting down UCF for a period of years as punishment for misusing at least $38 million in state funds to build the new Trevor Colburn Hall on campus.

Fine later walked back the remarks, calling them “hyperbole.” But UCF acknowledged redirecting the dollars for construction from instruction, research and other programs and university president Dale Whittaker resigned under withering criticism from state lawmakers.

While the focus has been sharpest on UCF, the University of Florida has confirmed opening an internal investigation into its use of several million dollars in state money to construct the Center of Outdoor and Recreation Education and clear woods to build three Greek housing lots, according to a whistle-blower complaint sent to DeSantis’ office and to the Department of Education.

USF officials admitted they misused $6.4 million of state operating funds on a building completed in 2010.

The questions surrounding spending has bolstered the push by the House to reduce dollars this year — which Fine said during an Appropriations Committee meeting on Wednesday comes only after state funding to universities was boosted by $1.1 billion over the past five years.

Universities also are sitting on fund balances that top $1 billion, Fine said.

“We have over-appropriated more money than needed,” Fine told the House budget panel.

The House proposal also tightens dollars for campus construction projects, allowing UF, for example, to use $50 million of its fund balance to complete construction of a data science and information technology building but ending future funding for renovations to the campus music building.

The House budget blueprint includes tighter restrictions on construction projects planned for FSU, UCF, USF and state colleges.

House budget chief Travis Cummings, R-Orange Park, said after his side approved an $89.9 billion budget — and the Senate OK’d a $90.3 billion version — that negotiations between the sides will dominate the second half of the legislative session.

“I think higher ed and K-12 are clearly going to be a couple of issues where negotiation and debate is going to occur between the House and Senate,"" Cummings said. ""That’s very apparent.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190331/dollars-for-florida-universities-colleges-emerge-as-battleground-between-house-senate?rssfeed=true,2019-03-31T17:41:28Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

1198,Man trekking through Florida to raise awareness about depression,"Two survivors of the Parkland shooting and a father who lost his daughter in the Sandy Hook massacre took their own lives this week.

These suicides are putting a spotlight on an invisible wound: survivor’s guilt.

Now, a South Carolina father trekking through our area is echoing that message, walking 700 miles up and down the Florida coast to stand up for people struggling with depression and to raise awareness about suicide.

“It’s kind of like a meditation,” Donnie Alford said.

With a 50-pound backpack on his shoulders, the 39-year-old says he walks close to 30 hours a day as part of his mission called My Walk Through Depression.

“I wanted to raise awareness not just for the people who suffer from depression, it’s also for the people who don’t but knows somebody that does,” Alford said.



For Alford, his depression and suicidal thoughts began in February 2014 when he found his father moments after he took his own life.

“A couple of days later, the mother of my child had a brain aneurysm and passed away the same day as the funeral,” he said.

But things would get worse.

Weeks later, Alford watched his grandfather pass away from dementia.

“I just didn’t want to talk. I wanted to get away. I got really close to suicide a couple of times,"" he said. ""That thought really crossed my mind a lot, that’s pretty much where it started.""

Alford eventually turned his depression into activism and is now vowing to help those who feel like giving up.

His father’s love for the beach is what inspired his 700-mile journey around the Florida coast.

He says he hopes his movement will bring joy to people, like some Parkland survivors, who are suffering in silence.

“To see someone so young, a kid taking their life, that right there, it hurts so much,” Alford said.

When he’s not sharing his message of reaching out for help, the 39-year-old is giving back to the community.

“Every day, I wake up, that’s what I want to do,"" Alford said. ""Just seeing the smiles on people’s faces, it just lights me up.""

Alford plans to head south to Miami, make his way across the state to the west coast, then eventually end his journey north in the Panhandle to help families rebuild after Hurricane Michael.

1209,Check out the latest in pet gear from the 2019 Global Pet Expo in Orlando,"Canine influencer Vienna takes us on a tour of this year's Global Pet Expo

Hello, humans! Wiener influencer Vienna (as in sausage) here. I’ve been sniffing through all the good stuff at the American Pet Products Association’s Global Pet Expo this year. Exciting stuff!

This year marked record-setting attendance numbers for Global Pet Expo in Orlando, with more than 17,000 people and an undisclosed number of dogs, cats, bunnies, pigs and chickens ogling the 3,604 booths. It takes humans three days to get through the humungous show, because the pet industry is big business, with 67 percent of U.S. households spending $72.56 billion last year in pet supplies.

Some of the products I saw made me drool, but I gotta admit, others left me scratching my head. Here are some of the cooler goodies, so you can get shopping.

Features include the power of TrackR’ global Crowd Locate network. When the pet passes any of their global users in this established network, it relays the location.

It also communicates with a miniature Wi-Fi beacon that establishes a ""Bluetooth Fence,” so if we stray from the set perimeter, our humans will be instantly alerted via email. And last, it comes with a step counter that saves the last four days of steps, to make sure our people know we’re getting enough exercise. Smartbuckle.com

Family-run Petique brought its 5-in-1 Pet Stroller, which transforms from stroller to backpack in seconds. The removable pet carrier secures in the car with the car seat feature. The stroller includes a luggage feature, so it can attach onto luggage for easier handling at the airport.

Petique also introduced an eco-friendly collection of cat habitats, including one that mimics London Bridge. Petique.com

Keeping us well dressed

Dressing pets in apparel and costumes has become a major trend over the past few years.

Pet Krewe, based in that original party town, New Orleans, exhibited costumes to “unleash the parade” A comprehensive augmented reality app, Pet Krewe GO, accompanies each costume and allows users to create videos for social media starring their furry friends. For example, when a pet parent purchases a mermaid costume for their pooch, they get a code that links to an AR world where the mermaid doggo is surrounded by waves, reefs, and jellyfish.

The company also donates 10 percent of their profits to animal shelters and other pet causes and only uses adoptable shelter animals as their costume models, which helps significantly in getting them placed in forever homes. Petkrewe.com

Keeping us clean

Oxyfresh, a company that believes oral hygiene is good for both man and beast, launched the Oxyfresh Pet Dental Spray at the Expo.

Safe for both dogs and cats, the unflavored, alcohol-free formula features a patented blend to neutralize organic compounds that cause pet bad breath. The spray is 100 percent non-toxic and free from harmful ingredients. Oxyfresh.com

Keeping us well fed

Elevated pet food bowls have become popular because they promote better digestion and keep us from straining our backs while we chew. Humans also like it because they reduce sloppy eating.

Kitchen Dog has a wall-mounted feeding system that improves and promotes a healthier feeding position. Pet parents can keep the kitchen floor cleaner by not having to move bowls or feeding stands prior to sweeping and mopping. The BPA-free bowls, which are made in the USA, can be easily removed and are dishwasher-safe. Its slim profile makes it perfect for RVs and boats. Kitchendog.com

At almost 20 years of age, The Rockster street dog not only is still going strong, he is still going after the ladies (he fathered a litter in 2016), which says a lot about the superfood he has been fed all these years. The Rockster’s humans, Zoe and Sven Ley, found him in Naples, Italy, during their honeymoon in 2004. They cancelled their honeymoon to rescue him, but the problem was that he refused commercial food.

The couple, who must be the best pet parents ever, set to creating pet food using theories on immunological responses from Zoe’s late godfather, Noble Prize winner for Medicine Sir John Vane. The special food transformed The Rockster. The family eventually went into production of Rockster superfood, which combines quality antibiotic- and growth hormone-free meats with a combination of superfoods such as quinoa, lingonberries, chia seeds and green-lipped mussels instead of fillers. Phillipspet.com

Drinkwell Pet Fountains by PetSafe feature a free-falling water stream with adjustable flow, because running water is healthier for animals than standing water in a bowl. Moreover, the fountains sound cool. Several styles and colors are available, including the elegant ceramic Seascape and Pagoda models, which would fit nicely with any upscale home décor. Petsafe.net

Colorado-based pet food manufacturer I and Love and You showcased Baked & Saucy, a new line of holistic, oven-baked dog food, baked in small batches and coated with yummy bone broth that transforms the meal into a stew. It's designed for dogs who never fail to appreciate a great meal, like moi. Iandloveandyou.com

Keeping us smelling good

Humans love us, but don’t often like the odors we emit. Unfortunately, many odor eliminators don't work well or may contain toxic ingredients. Pet House candles, wax melts, room sprays and car fresheners eliminate more than 99 percent of pet odors with spa-like fragrances, such as the newly launched Cucumber Mint, one in a large line of scents that are 100 percent non-toxic, allergen-free and made in the USA.

Keeping us healthy

We animals suffer from aches and pain just like humans. Dog Med Laser’s Low-Level Laser for pets can improve a dog or cat’s mobility, comfort and quality of life without risks and at home in just a few minutes a day.

The laser was designed specifically for use on dogs and cats suffering from musculoskeletal conditions like osteoarthritis, hip and elbow dysplasia, spinal disk conditions and patellar luxation. It can also be used for accelerating wound closure. Dogmedlaser.com

A few more before I go

I could go on, but there are lizards to catch. Before I take off, here are a few more worth mentioning:

My Pet My Scent was awarded best overall new product at Global Pet Expo. The product uses patented inhalation technology. Pet parents swab their scent from their arms, legs or neck with an alcohol wipe that transfers the scent to a hemp-infused disc on a locket attached to the pet’s collar to calm and comfort.

Eco-friendly WizSmart transforms more than 120 million unused diaper “seconds” into super-absorbent pet pads that last all day. Stay-put adhesive tabs secure the pad to the floor or the wall(as a target for boy dogs). Petix.com

The wonders of hemp and cannabidioil, or CBD, were touted everywhere at the Expo. One of the pioneers in that market niche is Treatibles, with full spectrum hemp oil to relieve anxiety, discomfort, loss of appetite and more. Treatibles.com

Gold Paw Series’ Walking Collection collars feature SwiftLock magnetic buckles that require minimum hand strength, making it every easy for folks with arthritis to gear up their pup. It’s also a fast-to-click solution for squirrely dogs. GoldPawSeries.com

1210,Decision nearing on Daytona short-term rentals,"Within a couple of months, a Circuit Court judge is expected to decide whether short-term rentals should be allowed in Daytona Beach homes and condominiums.

DAYTONA BEACH — A two-year legal tussle over short-term vacation rentals of houses and condominiums will likely get a judge's ruling in the next couple of months.

After a 90-minute hearing Tuesday morning, Circuit Court Judge Leah Case gave the opposing attorneys representing the city and renters until May 6 to file legal documents that will help her make a decision. After the documents are turned in, Case will have 60 days to rule or at least give a status update.

The two attorneys arguing for the renters say short-term rentals in private homes have always been legal in Daytona Beach and should remain as such. The attorney representing Daytona Beach maintains the rentals have been illegal for several decades.

The argument between the two sides stems from the 2015 overhaul of the city's land development code that changed some language dealing with rentals. Land development codes are lengthy publications packed with rules that regulate the development and use of land and buildings in a city or county.

At stake in the legal fight are hundreds of millions of dollars every year for both the local hotel industry and the short-term rental market that's separate from motels, hotels, timeshares and bed and breakfast inns. Some worry the judge's decision could allow the short-term rental market to expand, crippling Daytona Beach's hotel industry.

One study showed short-term rentals are a $31 billion industry in Florida. Daytona Beach's percentage was estimated to be $1.24 billion per year, and the tourist tax alone could come to $10 million to $12 million per year, the study found.

Case's final ruling could also have a huge impact on the future of neighborhoods throughout Daytona Beach, which could see a sudden spike in vacationers staying in homes next to full-time residents.

[ALSO READ: Daytona, investors spar over short-term rentals]

For decades, Daytona Beach property owners have been inking rental deals for a few days or weeks at a time under the radar of city officials who consider them illegal because they're in residential areas where the city contends they're not allowed. When the lawsuit was filed against the city in July 2017, 22 rental property owners outed themselves to argue that they're improving neighborhoods with dramatic makeovers of ramshackle houses and boosting the local economy by luring tourists with money to spend.

The lawsuit's ultimate goal is for Daytona Beach to allow rentals of homes, condos and apartments for a few nights or weeks citywide. Short-term vacation rentals are legal in Daytona Beach along some main thoroughfares where hotels and motels are allowed, and in parts of the beachside, downtown and Midtown. They're permitted in four types of tourist zoning districts and 13 types of redevelopment area zoning districts.

Plaintiff Stephanie Ruta has said she doesn't understand why the city doesn't work with property owners to license, inspect and tax short-term rentals.

In addition to asking the city to drop any pending code enforcement actions involving vacation rentals from March 2015 forward, the plaintiffs are hoping to be compensated for lost rental bookings since the city started cracking down a few years ago.

The lawsuit accuses the city of illegally making changes to its short-term rental rules four years ago. Plaintiffs' attorney Keith Brady even accused the city of carrying out ""a scheme"" during Tuesday's hearing at the Volusia County Courthouse Annex on City Island.

""It's a trick and I caught them,"" alleged Brady, whose law firm has offices in Orlando and St. Petersburg.

Brady said the city's old land development code had prohibitions on locations of accommodations, defined as places such as hotels and motels that were used for short-term lodging. The old land development code referred to homes as dwellings and they weren't included in the prohibitions, he said. In 2015 the language changed, and there are now rental prohibitions for something called other accommodations and dwellings.

""That's why they had to repeal it, or their scheme wouldn't work,"" Brady charged.

Assistant City Attorney Gary Glassman called Brady's comments ""offensive"" and said he would have asked for a mistrial if the remarks were made in front of a jury. Tuesday's hearing was held in a small room with only a few of the plaintiffs, attorneys for both sides, the judge and three court system employees.

Glassman said city codes typically list what's permitted, not what's prohibited, or else lists would get unwieldy. If the city wanted to legalize short-term rentals in homes it would have spelled that out, he said.

""If it's not there, it's not permitted,"" Glassman said.

But the lawsuit maintains that the city's old land development code did not expressly prohibit vacation rentals in any residential zoning district. A residential ban, and a prohibition in parts of some redevelopment areas, didn't come until January 2015 when the city's new land development code was adopted by the City Commission, according to the lawsuit.

Brady argues that the city had no legal right in 2015 to change short-term rental rules. A state law states that, since June 1, 2011, municipalities haven't been able to adopt new local laws or regulations that ""prohibit vacation rentals or regulate the duration or frequency of rental of vacation rentals.""

Glassman said the city's short-term rental rules were grandfathered in eight years ago. Then the new land development code ""carried forward the city's existing regulations relating to short-term rentals that were in the city's prior land development code, originally adopted in 1993,"" Glassman wrote in court documents.

Glassman argued in a court filing last year aiming to get the case tossed out that the plaintiffs have failed to show that the city's rental rules are invalid and weren't enforced prior to 2011.

Brady pointed out that when the city adopted a new land development code, it repealed the old one. So that would deem anything in the land development code passed in 2015 as new, and in violation of the 2011 cutoff for new short-term rental rules.

""It's an unenforceable, repealed law,"" he said.

If there ever were bans on short-term rentals in Daytona Beach homes prior to 2015, the land development code repeal that year would have wiped them out, Brady argued.

Glassman said in hindsight it might have been best not to call it a repeal in 2015.

1211,Military personnel & families can de-stress for free at weekly MacDill golf clinic.,"- Florida has more golf courses than any other state in the country. But a couple of them, here in the Bay Area, aren't well known. They are on the grounds of MacDill Air Force Base.

The two golf courses at the Bay Palm Golf Complex are both par 72 and anyone with access to the base can play on them.

""Anyone with a Department of Defense ID card or their guest,"" said Bay Palm Complex general manager Lou Harris. ""So pretty much anybody that can pass the background check, the vetting that they do to get people on base, they can play golf here.""

But each Wednesday, from noon until one, the driving range is reserved for active duty military personnel and their spouses for free golf lessons.

When Fox 13 News stopped by on a recent Wednesday, Air Force Reserves Maj. Bill Kerr was getting some tips on taking the slice out of his swing from assistant manager Dave Stewart.

""It's nice to come out, hit a few balls and see what they can teach us,"" said. Maj. Kerr. ""There's a lot of knowlegable guys out here so it's a great bonus we get, to get this hour on Wednesdays for free.""

The clinic gives them a chance to put their stressful jobs aside and focus on their swing.

""Hopefully they get some relaxation,"" said Harris. ""We're not putting our lives on the line out here. There's nobody bleeding, there's nobody shooting at us. So we can enjoy ourselves a little bit. That's where golf comes in. That's the game of a lifetime.""

1212,"New ER entrance, rooms open at ORMC","The latest additions are among a flurry of construction projects at the hospital's main Ocala campus.

Ocala Regional Medical Center unveiled the latest upgrades to the emergency department, along with a new floor adding 34 beds, on Tuesday at the hospital's main campus near downtown Ocala.

The new emergency department entrance is just around the corner of the former entrance at 1431 SW 1st Ave. The old entrance will transition into an ambulance-only entrance. The new lobby and two new triage rooms will open Wednesday. Renovations will soon start on a portion of the emergency rooms, said Lauren Debick, ORMC spokeswoman.

Down the hall and around a few more corners, an elevator now goes up to the new third floor, which includes 34 beds dedicated to stroke patients. The new level is part of the hospital's new designation as a comprehensive stroke center from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. The designation means the hospital has the ability to provide advanced diagnostics, certain types of neurological surgery, rehabilitation and more.

Fourteen of the beds are already in use, with the other 20 coming online in the next couple of weeks, Debick said.

ORMC’s stroke center will provide on-site neurosurgeons available around-the-clock, which will allow patients access to a number of stroke interventions. The hospital has dedicated beds for neurological patients and the stroke center will provide specially-trained doctors, surgeons and health care providers.



Advanced diagnostic equipment for the center includes an imaging machine that produces a three-dimensional view of the brain. The equipment also allows for intervention in cases of clots in the brain, a procedure that once required the transfer of the patient out of Marion County, Debick said.

On April 4, ORMC announced a new $31 million expansion. That project will add 29,000 square feet dedicated to cardiovascular inpatient services.

The project will add a second floor to the area that now houses the intensive care unit. The addition will add 34 more beds, which will bring the total to 290. The cardiac care unit includes cardiac ICU beds, intermediate care beds and beds for patients receiving cardiac procedures including catheterization.

1217,Tallahassee runners take on the Boston Marathon,"Mickey Moore had to stop and walk a few times. His right hamstring tightened on him late in the race. The weather featured rain at the start and heat and humidity at the end.

None of that mattered.

Moore couldn’t have been happier – or more thankful - after he clocked a 3:16:11 in Monday’s Boston Marathon.

“I am on cloud nine,” Moore said. “Sometimes the unexpected can happen if you believe enough, try hard enough and love something enough.”

Moore, 49, pointed to a challenging last nine months that saw him change jobs and undergo knee surgery in December. The established runner trained only eight weeks for his third Boston Marathon.

“I didn’t know what to expect, but this is a great day,” said Moore, who earned a qualifying time by nearly 10 minutes for next year’s 26.2-mile race. “I couldn’t be happier.”

Moore was among a group of Tallahassee runners who made the trek to Boston for the famed 123rd marathon.

It’s the oldest and considered the most prestigious annual marathon in the world. The race had a wet start, but it wasn’t as cold as expected. Temperatures were in the 60s – with rays of sunshine – by the time many runners crossed the finish line.

Veteran marathoners Jack McDermott and wife Laura always enjoy the race. It was Jack’s 18th consecutive Boston Marathon and Laura’s fourth.

However, Jack, coming off a 100-mile race only weeks ago, was disappointed with his time (3:22:33).

“I did not run very well and I was lucky to get as fast as I got,” McDermott said. “But I did it, and it’s always such a fabulous event.”

The lone hitch in Laura’s run was her official time, which showed identical marks for gun timing and chip timing. (That’s only possible for runners who start at the front). Laura clocked herself at 3:43:08.

“It was fun, it was exhilarating and there definitely some highs and lows throughout the race,” Laura said. “I was faster last year in the freezing rain – Jack and I both do better when it’s colder.”

Laura laughed as she pointed out the unpredictable weather that’s always seems to accompany the Boston Marathon. As the couple waited on a ride after the race to their hotel, it started to cloud up and rain, topped by a cool breeze.

“I could have really used that during the race,” she said.

Former Leon High football player Matt Glass, 37, who weighed 220 pounds in high school and only started to run to lose weight before his 2003 marriage, clocked a 3:01:57 in his first Boston Marathon. Glass, who lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, with his wife and 7-year-old son, thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Unexpectedly, he also saw his wife, son, niece and sister Alison Thumm, who made the trip from Tallahassee, among the cheering crowd near the 21-mile mark.

“It was awesome. The way the city has everything set up, it’s fantastic,” Glass said. “The pure adrenaline you get from the fans on the course, it was nothing like I have ever been part of. It was such a great experience.”

Tom Parker, 36, also was thrilled with his performance, coming in under three hours at 2:57:53 and setting a personal record by more than five minutes.

""It was a tough run with the heat and humidity picking up in the second half, but I stuck with it and trusted my training,"" Parker posted on his Facebook page. ""Beyond happy with an almost 5:30 minute pr. About half a million fans cheering along the way certainly helped. Such a great city and an amazing race. I don’t know when I will be back but at some point I am coming again for you Boston.""

PASCO COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - A gator was obeying the law as it took a casual stroll through a Land O' Lakes subdivision Saturday.

Keith Soloninka snapped a couple of photos of the gator using a crosswalk in Connerton Village.

""At least the gator was following the rules and using the crosswalk,"" Soloninka told News Channel 8.

The FWC says alligator mating season is underway. The gator courtship phase begins in early April and mating is expected to take place in May or June.

1219,Relief may be on way for food deserts in Jacksonville,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - In Northwest Jacksonville, there's just one grocery store where residents can buy fresh fruit, vegetables, and meat, but that could soon change. Harvey's is the only one in the large area of town, which experts deem a food desert.

City lawmakers have proposed a new ordinance (2019-245) to bring more healthy food options to Northwest Jacksonville. A similar ordinance proposed last year allowed for a consultant to evaluate the area to determine specific needs.

For many who live in the Moncrief area, Harvey's is the only way for them to get fresh, healthy food without having to travel several miles.

One shopper, who preferred not to be identified, said more grocery options are needed.

""It would be great in this area. I just moved over here a couple of months ago and there’s really not a Walmart over here. There’s one off of Dunn Avenue. As far as grocery stores, this (Harveys) is about the only one.""

The City Council wants to adopt a new full-service grocery program that would appropriate $3 million for grocery stores and healthy options education. It's news many who live in Moncrief are happy to hear.

""For me, the more the better,"" said resident Leslie.

Shoppers said this has been a long-awaited project.

The proposal finds that nearly 180,000 people in Jacksonville are food insecure.

STUART, Fla. (WFLA/AP) - A forensic psychologist says a former college student believed he was ""half-dog, half-man"" when he fatally attacked a man and woman at their home and was found biting one of their faces.

Austin Harrouff was 19 and was a student at Florida State University when authorities say he attacked John Stevens, 59, and his wife Michelle Mishcon, 53, as they sat in their garage with the door open on Aug. 15, 2016.

911 dispatchers had received a call from a neighbor who said he was stabbed while trying to stop an assault at a home across the street from him. A deputy arrived to find Harrouff on top of Stevens who was lying on the driveway of the home. ""He was biting the victim on the face and removing pieces of his face,"" Martin County Sheriff William told reporters in 2016.

RELATED: Cops: FSU student stabs, kills couple, bites husband's face

Additional deputies responded and stung Harrouff multiple times with tasers. They also instructed a deputy K9 to attack Harrouff, who showed ""abnormal levels of strength.""

Now, a 38-page mental-health report released this week by the Martin County State Attorney's Office.says Harrouff believed he was ""half-dog, half-man"" at the time of the attack.

The Palm Beach Post is reporting that Dr. Phillip Resnick's report says the fact that Harrouff persisted in biting Stevens ""in the presence of police officers, in spite of threats of being shot, being tased and receiving multiple kicks to the head, suggests that Mr. Harrouff was actively psychotic.""

Harrouff's attorneys are preparing an insanity defense for the Nov. 4 trial.

A Florida couple left one of their eight children behind at a park after a family outing Friday night and didn't report the toddler missing until nearly noon Saturday, deputies said.

Jolanda Larose Alexandre and Makenson Alexandre, 34, told the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office they didn't realize they'd left the 2-year-old girl behind.

Passersby found the child ""wandering alone"" at Haverhill Park on Friday evening just before sunset, deputies said.

When deputies were called, they spent about three hours trying to find the girl’s caregivers, including making loudspeaker announcements and bringing in search and rescue dogs, the sheriff's office said.

The department had no idea whom the girl belonged to until the Alexandres called authorities the next day, deputies said.

The Alexandres were arrested and charged with child neglect, and officials with the Florida Department of Children and Families also removed the remaining seven children from the home, deputies said.

The girl had been left behind at about 7 p.m. Friday and was missing for more than 14 hours, according to the sheriff's office.

At about 8 a.m. Saturday, the sheriff's office posted a photo of the girl, who turns 3 this Thursday, asking ""Does anyone know who this little beautiful baby girl belongs to?"" with a ""heartbroken"" emoji on Facebook.

""We were dumbfounded. We were so upset,"" PBSO Public Information Officer Teri Barbera said, adding that the girl was in ""great condition,"" dressed nicely in a pink “Adorable” T-shirt and white tutu, and otherwise seemed to be generally well cared-for.

Jolanda Alexandre told authorities she had taken all the kids to the park to let them play for about an hour after picking Makenson up from work, then told them to get back into the minivan before she drove home and let them continue playing outside their apartment, according to a probable cause affidavit released Monday morning.

Jolanda Alexandre said she thought the little girl was with all the other kids but that on Saturday morning after she woke up, she and Makenson realized at about 9 a.m. that the toddler was missing, according to the affidavit.

Frantically searching for the girl, the mother was ""crying and shaking"" as she asked authorites for help and said she couldn't believe this happened, the affidavit said. Both parents said they usually check on all the children before bed but had not on Friday night, the document states.",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190325/florida-couple-leaves-1-of-8-children-behind-at-park-dont-report-toddler-missing-until-next-day-deputies-say?rssfeed=true,2019-03-25T09:43:30Z,News Chief,Couple,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881

1232,Jaguars' head coach Doug Marrone: No punishment for Leonard Fournette after arrest,"0 Jaguars' head coach Doug Marrone: No punishment for Leonard Fournette after arrest

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) - Jacksonville Jaguars coach Doug Marrone has no plans to punish running back Leonard Fournette following his arrest for driving with a suspended license.

Marrone made it clear Tuesday that Fournette made a mistake, saying ""a law was broken,"" but added that the team would have no further discipline for the fourth overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft.

TRENDING:

""I don't want to get into where I stand here and I'm trying to lessen anything,"" said Marrone, who was arrested for a similar issue in 1997. ""But at the same time I don't want to get into, 'Oh my gosh,'""

Fournette was arrested last Thursday and spent less than 30 minutes in the Duval County Jail. He paid a $1,508 bond.

Fournette was pulled over after a Jacksonville Sheriff's deputy clocked him driving 65 mph in a 45 mph zone, according to a police report. Fournette was cited for speeding and for having illegal tint on his SUV. He was arrested for his license, which was suspended last month after he failed to pay or protest a speeding ticket from November 2018.

Fournette was cited in nearby Neptune Beach last year for driving 37 mph in a 25 mph zone.

After spending most of the offseason working out in Wyoming, Fournette returned to Jacksonville last week in time for the start of the team's offseason conditioning program. His arrest was the latest issue for the former LSU star who was suspended, fined, injured and acknowledged he was not in ideal shape late in the 2018 season.

""Nobody's worried about what's going to come from that,"" veteran defensive end Calais Campbell said. ""We're confident that that's going to pass over. He's going to be ready to go to work. He came in in great shape. He looks good and has a good attitude, so I'm looking forward to seeing his progression and what he does this year.""

FOURNETTE RELATED LINKS

Pro Bowl cornerback Jalen Ramsey and linebacker Telvin Smith were the only players not in attendance for the volunteer workouts. Marrone said he reached out to both players, ""but I have not heard back from either.""

Campbell said their absences were no big deal.

""Those are two guys I'm not worried about,"" Campbell said. ""Those are guys I know who are going to come back in tiptop shape, focused and ready to go. I know they're grinding, their work ethic. They're going to be just fine.""

No one knows what to expect Fournette from Fournette this fall.

The Jaguars voided the remaining guarantees in Fournette's four-year rookie contract worth $27.1 million. The team made the move following his weeklong suspension in late November for instigating a fight in Buffalo.

Fournette challenged the decision, which could cost him up to $7.1 million.

Fournette had a lengthy meeting with Marrone and personnel chief Tom Coughlin after the season in hopes of clearing the air and staring anew.

His arrest put him back in the spotlight.

""It's unfortunate, but at the same time, he's here, he's got a good mindset,"" Campbell said. ""He's a big personality, coming with a lot of good energy. He's positive and eager to get better. I'm looking forward to seeing what he does because I feel like that Year 3 is where you really kind of find out who are guys and what he's going to develop into. The atmosphere he's had these last couple of days and the mentality, he looks focused and ready.""

Marrone dealt with a similar arrest while he was an assistant coach at Georgia Tech.

Marrone was pulled over in Daytona Beach Shores for driving 57 mph in a 35 mph zone on June 20, 1997. He was arrested for driving with a suspended license and had coach George O'Leary pay his $100 bond.

Marrone told Fournette that story when they met following the player's arrest, trying to make it a ""learning lesson.""

""I've addressed it and moved on,"" Marrone said.

1236,"Internet intrigue: Blitz of lobbyists, consultants worked behind scenes before broadband vote","Broadband fiber (Photo: Photo courtesy of EPB Fiber Optics)

When talk of a city-owned broadband internet utility surfaced at the same time an out-of-town fiber-optic firm eyed Tallahassee as a potential new market, lobbyists, public relations people and industry consultants streamed into action.

The debate during City Commission meetings last month was contentious enough. But there was intrigue behind the curtain. And by the time the dust settled, the commission reversed course on plans to explore creation of a new utility, something MetroNet, an Indiana-based company still considering coming to town, opposed.

The players included Max Herrle, a local lobbyist who sought MetroNet as a client, Terrie Ard, president of the influential PR firm Moore, Inc., which worked with MetroNet, and Stephanie Bowden, a governmental affairs consultant with industry giant Comcast.

The drama that unfolded came after years of high-profile controversy involving lobbyists and consultants at City Hall. Ethics watchdogs say it highlights the kind of murky dealings that undermine confidence in the city's ability to police lobbying within its own halls.

Reversing course: Commission negates municipal broadband study, forms working group to study internet access

Months before the broadband debate took center stage, a conversation between Herrle and MetroNet set off alarm bells at City Hall, though exactly what happened is now disputed. City officials said they were told Herrle ""misrepresented"" himself on the call, but both Herrle and the company said nothing ""inappropriate"" happened.

Meanwhile, the Moore firm began working with MetroNet in hopes the company would set up shop in Tallahassee. Ard took part in meetings with commissioners, MetroNet execs and economic-development staff and emailed talking points to a commissioner. But she said she wasn't paid for the work and doesn't consider herself a lobbyist.

Bowden, a governmental affairs consultant for Comcast, met with Matlow in the midst of the debate. And while she had registered in previous years with the city as a Comcast lobbyist, she wasn’t registered when she met with Matlow. Records show she registered the following day.

Matlow proposed the city look into launching its own fiber-optic broadband network on Dec. 5, during his second meeting as commissioner. He cited success seen in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where the city offers retail broadband at super-fast speeds and competitive prices while reaping millions in revenue.

He appeared to have a slim majority of the commission behind him. On March 6, Matlow and Commissioners Elaine Bryant and Dianne Williams-Cox voted 3-2 in favor of the request for proposals on a feasibility study. But pressure mounted from the business community, which didn't want to see government competing with the private sector.

Bryant announced March 22 she wanted to reconsider her vote, prompting commissioners on March 27 to rescind the RFP vote and opt instead to have a city-staffed working group study broadband but not a new utility.

The behind-the-scenes consulting blitz came at the same time ethics advocates have been asking for tighter restrictions on lobbyists at City Hall. Ben Wilcox, a member of Citizens for Ethics Reform, said the city needs a strong and enforceable ordinance that allows the public to know who is trying to shape public policy and why.

“We have rules that apply to lobbying,” Wilcox said. “The purpose of the rules is to allow the public to see who is trying to exert influence on public policy. And it seems like people are playing kind of fast and loose with those lobbying rules.”

Matlow declined to comment for this article. His office initially agreed to an interview but canceled, issuing a statement instead.

“We condemn in the strongest possible terms any attempt to improperly influence the commission and prevent us from enacting public policy in the interest of the community,"" he said.

City says lobbying call led to complaint

MetroNet, which is based in Evansville, Indiana, and operates in more than 50 markets, has been considering moving into Tallahassee since last summer. Were it to come to town, it would lay down fiber optic lines and offer retail broadband service, competing with Comcast and others.

Months after it began talks with city staff, Herrle, a lobbyist known for representing restaurants and bars, reached out to the company to see if it would be interested in hiring him. But after a phone call between Herrle and MetroNet executives, Wayne Tedder, assistant city manager, said he got a phone call from the company.

Questions remain to be answered about CRA governance going forward. (Photo: Hali Tauxe/Democrat)

“I had a representative from MetroNet reach out to me and indicate that he was concerned that if he didn’t hire Max Herrle that it would impact his ability to come to Tallahassee,” Tedder said. “What I indicated to MetroNet was that relationships with commissioners had no impact with their ability to come to Tallahassee.”

Tedder said he explained that a commission vote wasn’t necessary for MetroNet to begin operations and that permit approvals happened at the staff level. He reported the conversation to City Manager Reese Goad, who asked him to tell Matlow.

“I was concerned that the lobbyist was misrepresenting Commissioner Matlow,” Goad said. “And (soon after) Commissioner Matlow thanked me for bringing it to his attention and he confirmed that he followed up with MetroNet to clarify that that was not the case and that the lobbyist had overstated his relationship.”

Herrle denied insinuating any such thing. He said he emailed MetroNet in early December to gauge its interest in hiring a consultant and they agreed to talk. He and the company signed a nondisclosure agreement as part of the interview process, Herrle said. The company ended up not hiring him.

MetroNet denies 'inappropriate' ask

MetroNet declined to discuss the phone calls in detail. The company issued a statement saying it often gets calls from potential vendors as it expands into new markets.

“We have received phone calls from potential vendors in Florida including one call from Max Herrle,” said Keith Leonhardt, vice president of communications and market development, in an email. ""We did not hire Mr. Herrle nor do we have plans to do so.”

The company amended its comments later, after the Democrat contacted Herrle about the phone call and Herrle contacted MetroNet.

“At no time did Mr. Herrle offer or imply to offer any service that would be considered inappropriate,"" Leonhardt said in the amended statement.

Herrle went on to register as a lobbyist for Magellan Advisors, which produces the very studies on municipal-run broadband that MetroNet didn’t want commissioners to approve. On Feb. 11, Herrle emailed Matlow a link to several broadband feasibility studies written by Magellan.

Matlow and Herrle have connections beyond a $250 contribution the lobbyist gave the commissioner during his campaign last year. In the closing days of the election, Herrle was an apparent force behind a commercial attacking Matlow’s opponent, Lisa Miller.

On Oct. 22, 2018, Herrle’s political committee, North Florida Leadership Fund PC, gave $10,500 to another political committee, Florida Young Democrats, based in Port St. Lucie. The next day, Florida Young Democrats paid Herrle $10,000. A few days later, the anti-Brown commercial, paid for by Florida Young Democrats, showed up on YouTube.

PR firm sends talking points to Bryant

Moore, the public relations firm whose clients include Ford Motor Company and the Florida Prepaid College Board, started working with MetroNet in November, Ard said. Moore facilitated key meetings with business leaders and city officials on behalf of MetroNet.

“We’re doing this under the lens of business development,” Ard said. “As a business leader here in our community ... I have a passion and an interest in bringing new companies into our community.”

Ard accompanied MetroNet executives during meetings with commissioners and staff from the Office of Economic Vitality. She said the purpose was to introduce company officials to commissioners and educate them that MetroNet was interested in coming to Tallahassee as long as the city didn’t pursue its own broadband utility.

The meetings were held March 25, just two days before the City Commission vote to reconsider the feasibility study. A couple of hours before the meeting, she sent an email to Bryant with “Talking points” in the subject line. She said she sent the information at Bryant’s request, something the commissioner confirmed.

She wrote in the email that MetroNet could bring more than 20 initial jobs to town and invest about $70 million in local fiber. She noted fiber-optic technology was available to fewer than 20 percent of the country and MetroNet’s arrival would be a “game changer” in business recruitment efforts and creating a more connected community.

Pro and con:

Ard, in her email to Bryant, also warned that if the city pursued its own broadband utility, MetroNet would go elsewhere.

“The city of Tallahassee should not invest money in a feasibility study or getting into the business of a municipal broadband utility when we have private industry providing this service already and others interested in moving into the market,” she wrote. “MetroNet will not want to compete in a market where a municipality is trying to do this service.”

Company says it doesn't lobby

Ard said that while Moore is working with MetroNet, it is not under contract with the firm and has not and will not be paid for its work to date. She said Moore is hopeful the company will hire Moore as its “agency of record” if it comes to Tallahassee.

“It’s an understanding that they are looking at Tallahassee for their possible expansion and at that time, they will be looking for a communications partner,” she said. “And this is business development engagement for us. It’s helping to introduce them and be a connector to key business leaders and city officials.”

Ard said no one at Moore lobbies the government.

“We are a communications marketing digital firm,” she said. “We are not a lobbying firm and no one here is a lobbyist nor have they ever been. The bottom line is we do not do lobbying.”

Bryant said she asked Ard to prepare notes from their meeting as part of her effort to gather all information she could. But she said she had already decided she was against a new utility by that point.

“I had already made up my mind,” Bryant said. “That had no influence on me.”

Bryant’s aide, Angela Whitaker, confirmed in a March 25 email to OEV staff that Bryant could meet with Ard and MetroNet. Whitaker also linked to the city’s website on lobbying.

“Please review the city of Tallahassee’s registration of lobbyists process in case it is applicable to this organization,” Whitaker wrote.

Comcast lobbyist wasn't registered

Another consultant, Comcast’s Bowden, met with Commissioner Matlow on March 13. Matlow, in an interview last month, said Bowden gave a broad overview of Comcast’s efforts in the broadband field.

“She was largely, I guess, trying to get a sense of what we were proposing and I explained to her getting a better understanding of the future of connectivity,” Matlow said in an interview last month. “It was pretty high level. We didn’t get into the specifics or details.”

Matlow said Bowden “didn’t directly make a statement on the actual issue.” But he added, “I had concerns that people are lobbying on this who may not be registered.”

Bowden registered with the city as a Comcast lobbyist in 2017 and last year. But she didn’t register this year until March 14, a day after the Matlow meeting.

Mindy Kramer, vice president of public relations for Comcast’s Florida region, said Bowden met with Matlow in part because he is a new commissioner. She added that the only commissioner Bowden met with was Matlow.

“It is part of (Bowden’s) role to introduce herself to local officials, educate them about our business, our programs and our network capabilities,” Kramer said in an email.

Lobbying lines get 'blurry'

City ordinance defines a lobbyist as someone ""who is employed and receives payment, or who contracts for economic consideration, for the purpose of lobbying.” It further defines a lobbyist as one ""who is principally employed for governmental affairs by another person or governmental entity"" to lobby for that person or entity.

The ordinance requires lobbyists to register annually and file quarterly compensation reports. Under the ordinance, the city’s ethics officer is responsible for monitoring lobbyists for compliance. However, the city's Independent Ethics Board is considering moving that dutyto the treasurer-clerk’s office, something the citizens group opposes.

Back story: Citizens group wants more Ethics Board oversight of city lobbyists

City records show not a single complaint involving a lobbyist has been filed with the Ethics Board since it began meeting in 2015. However, the city has had plenty of trouble with lobbyists and consultants.

Last year, former City Manager Rick Fernandez was ousted over his acceptance of gifts, including free Florida State football tickets, from lobbyist Adam Corey's firm. Earlier this year, he was fined $6,000 by the Florida Commission on Ethics for gift violations.

The Ethics Commission also found probable cause in January that former Mayor Andrew Gillum accepted illegal gifts during trips to New York City and Costa Rica with Corey. Gillum is contesting the charges, and a final hearing is set for next week.

In December, Commissioner Scott Maddox and Paige Carter-Smith were indicted over an alleged bribery ring run through their Governance consulting firm. Carter-Smith and others were hired by Uber and Yellow Cab in 2015 as the city worked on a vehicle-for-hire ordinance, though they didn't register as lobbyists.

Wilcox, one of the ethics advocates, said a fine line separates consulting from lobbying.

“I think it’s very blurry,” he said. “In an ideal world, people who are trying to influence public policy would register to lobby. The public needs to be able to see what are now unseen forces that are shaping public policy.""

1237,Orlando Magic look for 2-0 series leads,"Orlando had to fight until the final days of the regular season to get its postseason berth. Portland had to scramble down the stretch to replace a huge part of its success.

And as is usually the case, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich had his team playing its best basketball at the end.

The Magic, Trail Blazers and Spurs were playoff ready. That's why they're all taking 1-0 series leads into their respective Game 2s on Tuesday night - with Orlando at Toronto, San Antonio at Denver and Portland playing host to Oklahoma City.

Orlando and San Antonio, both No. 7 seeds, won on the road and grabbed home-court advantage. But they both know what's coming when Denver and Toronto get fueled by desperation on Tuesday night.

""It's going to be a lot tougher,"" Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan said.

""We're going to get their best,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said.

It goes without saying that all the teams that are down 1-0 found ways to get better for Game 2. The same goes for the teams leading those series. Clifford has spent two days imploring the Magic to clean up their offense. San Antonio felt it gave Denver too many open looks. Portland won with the help of Oklahoma City missing 28 tries from 3-point range, which likely won't happen again.

""We played nine players, six of those players it was their first time in the playoffs, their playoff debut,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Overall they handled those playoff nerves fairly well.""

The nerves should be lessened Tuesday.

Toronto dropped a Game 1 for the 14th time in 16 playoff series. The Raptors aren't fazed. Kyle Lowry was scoreless in Game 1, but Raptors coach Nick Nurse said defense was the bigger issue for his club.

""We didn't guard the ball well enough,"" Nurse said. ""And when we didn't guard the ball well enough, we didn't have our second line of help in position. And then we did a poor job of executing some of the game plan portions. Just too many, just strange things I almost can't explain. Somebody would leave a guy and all of a sudden he's standing there wide open. Those things can't happen.""

Portland, perhaps written off by some when Jusuf Nurkic got hurt late in the season, had a great Game 1 performance from Enes Kanter.

""He gave us a lot of toughness,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said.

A look at Tuesday's games:

MAGIC AT RAPTORS

Magic lead 1-0. Game 2, 8 p.m. EDT, TNT

NEED TO KNOW: Toronto was 32-3 in the regular season when allowing 105 points or less. Magic center Nikola Vucevic had his worst shooting game of the season in Game 1. And Orlando won anyway, 104-101.

KEEP AN EYE ON: Kyle Lowry. Much was made of how the Raptors' point guard was scoreless in Game 1. But Toronto outscored Orlando 75-64 when he was on the floor, and was outscored 40-26 when he was on the bench - including a couple of fast-moving, momentum-shifting 9-2 and 10-4 runs by the Magic.

INJURY WATCH: Magic guard Michael Carter-Williams is fine after getting hit in the face by Lowry in Game 1.

PRESSURE IS ON: Obviously, Raptors coach Nick Nurse. He has this job in large part because his predecessor didn't get it done in the postseason. If Nurse starts 0-2, the 58-win regular season will be fast forgotten.

SPURS AT NUGGETS

Spurs lead 1-0. Game 2, 9 p.m. EDT, NBA TV.

NEED TO KNOW: Denver center Nikola Jokic had the 10th game in NBA playoff history of at least 14 rebounds and 14 assists, and the Nuggets lost anyway. Jokic had the ball plenty in Game 1. The Nuggets need to get him more shots in Game 2; he had only nine in the opener.

KEEP AN EYE ON: San Antonio's defense. The Spurs challenged Denver to beat them from the perimeter in Game 1 - and Will Barton, Gary Harris and Jamal Murray shot a combined 21 of 50, 2 for 16 from 3-point range.

STAT QUIRK: The Spurs were 1-9 in the regular season when LaMarcus Aldridge shot 33 percent or worse. He shot 6 for 19 in Game 1 (31.6 percent) and the Spurs prevailed.

PRESSURE IS ON: The Nuggets in transition. They forced 11 turnovers, eight of them off steals, but turned them into only eight points. If the Spurs are going to make mistakes, they must capitalize better.

THUNDER AT TRAIL BLAZERS

Trail Blazers lead 1-0. Game 2, 10:30 p.m. EDT, TNT.

NEED TO KNOW: Out of the first 2,476 games by teams this season, only 14 shot worse from 3-point range than the Thunder (5-33) did in Game 1. Not surprisingly, all 14 of those teams lost, too.

KEEP AN EYE ON: It looks like Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum have had enough with the first-round exits. Neither shot it great in Game 1 - Lillard was 9 for 21, McCollum 9 for 24 - but they were aggressive and set the necessary tone, which is exactly what the Blazers need from their starting guards.

INJURY WATCH: It all hinges on Paul George's right shoulder, which he says is fine. ""It's well enough now,"" George said after Oklahoma City practiced Monday. It bears noting that he said that with a large ice pack strapped to his shoulder.

PRESSURE IS ON: Russell Westbrook. Starting with when the Thunder took (and eventually wasted) a 3-1 lead against the Warriors in the 2016 Western Conference finals, OKC has lost 12 of its last 15 postseason games.

1239,Noted Marion County horse farms hit the market,"Ocala Jockey Club owners seek partner or buyer, while the foreclosed BG Ocala Ranch goes to auction.

A couple of high-profile farms hit the real estate market recently.

One is the Ocala Jockey Club, home of the Ocala Jockey Club International Three-day Event, a high-level eventing competition held annually in November.

The other is BG Ocala Ranch, once owned by Bobby Genovese, a Canadian-born venture capitalist currently facing Securities and Exchange Commission charges of fraud for allegedly manipulating trading of a purported mining company to the tune of $17 million. Genovese denies any wrongdoing. The case is ongoing in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Ocala Jockey Club

The Ocala Jockey Club, 8720 W. County Road 318, is a nearly 1,000-acre property with a rich history. A well-regarded restaurant once operated out of the clubhouse, which sits on a high point of the property. There were plans for a residential equestrian community but they fell through, leaving a few townhomes completed.

In 2016, owners Erik and Paula Nygaard established a premiere eventing course and competition that draws some of the best eventers to the area for the three-day competition, which features dressage, show jumping and cross-country jumping. The Nygaards also continue to operate a thoroughbred training facility on property.

Now, they are looking for a partner or a buyer.

""The eventing community and the Ocala community have grown to depend on this event to continue, and we believe this is important to facilitate,"" Paula Nygaard wrote recently. ""In order to do so, the event and the property deserves to look to upgrades and a larger team than we are able to commit on our own for the long term. This is why we believe that the property and the event will have an opportunity to be stronger with either strategic partners or with a new buyer who will be able to take the property further and faster than we are able to do on our own.""

They established a Facebook page named Florida Estate to help market the property.

The farm's equestrian facilities use about 400 acres of the property. Another 600 acres remain undeveloped ""parkland.""

The Nygaards want to keep the property equestrian-centered.

""We welcome proposals from well-capitalized operating partners with experience in resort development or boutique hotel development, as well as restaurateurs or equestrian competition organizers/developers. Developers wishing to build McMansions on dense-packed lots are not welcome here,"" the Facebook offer states.

The property includes at least seven barns, a training track, a 5,600-square-foot clubhouse and 15 townhouses.

The Nygaards spent more than $11.3 assembling the property since 2005, according to property records. There is no sale price listed.

BG Ocala Ranch

Before Genovese paid $2.8 million for the 86.6-acre property at 11800 S. County Road 475 in 2011, it was the home of Ocala Foxtrotter Ranch, which featured water slides and a private railroad. The property was part of the 270-acre Sez Who thoroughbred breeding and training farm established by Richard Simon.

After the 2008 financial collapse, the property fell into foreclosure before Genovese took it over. But foreclosure struck the property again when Genovese defaulted on a $3 million loan made by Iberiabank in 2015, according to records on file with the Marion County clerk of court.

The property is up for auction with bidding starting on May 6 at 9 a.m. and ending on May 15 at 1 p.m. The farm is adjacent to the Florida Agriculture Center and Horse Park. Tranzon Driggers is running the auction, and details are available at tranzon.com/DG1112.

The property features an equestrian center with three barns, a large covered arena, an outdoor lighted arena, a polo field and access to riding trails. There are a number of buildings on property, including an eight-bedroom, nearly 10,000-square-foot main house, a three-bedroom house and six mobile homes. There was no starting bid announced, but prospective bidders must put down a $50,000 deposit to participate in the auction.

1240,In the Know: Extended-stay hotel breaks ground off Pine Ridge Road in Naples,"Home2 Suites by Hilton, an extended-stay hotel, is under construction off Pine Ridge Road in North Naples. (Photo: Home2 Suites by Hilton)

Q: Land has been cleared behind Suncoast Credit Union on Pine Ridge Road next to the vacated Harley-Davidson building. Do you know what is going to be built there?

— Ann Walters, North Naples

A: Ground was broken March 8 for Home2 Suites by Hilton, an extended-stay hotel targeted to open next year off Pine Ridge Road in North Naples.

The three-story hotel will have 99 suites on that 2.86-acre property at 3685 Kramer Drive, between the former Harley-Davidson store and ExtraSpace Storage. The hotel, projected to open in fall 2020 at the end of Whippoorwill Lane, is being developed by Indiana-based Good Hospitality Services and being built by Naples-based Phoenix Associates of South Florida.

The North Naples location will be the first Home2 Suites in Southwest Florida. The nearest locations are in Fort Lauderdale, Florida City and Sarasota.

Underground utilities work for plumbing and electrical lines is underway now on the recently cleared acreage.

“We hope to be pouring the floor in a couple of weeks,” said Jeff Good, president of Good Hospitality Services, a hotel management and development company.

The new hotel will include an outdoor saltwater swimming pool, a fitness room and an outdoor seating area beneath a pergola, architectural plans show. The pet-friendly hotel chain features in-suite kitchens, and hotel rates include a complimentary hot breakfast and Wi-Fi.

Good Hospitality Services, which has built more than 60 hotels representing a variety of brands in the last two decades, has been wanting to launch a hotel in Naples for about five years, especially on that section of Pine Ridge near an Interstate 75 interchange, said Good, who has owned a condominium in Mercato for five years. A resident of Valparaiso, Indiana, Good is the chairman of the Porter County Commission there in the northwest part of the state.

“We are really excited. We think that area out there is in need of a hotel. The average length of stay has always been very robust in that market,” Good said. “We are ecstatic and excited to be part of the community. We just like the area. It’s a very nice area. I think we will fit in nicely.”

The North Naples hotel is the third Home2 Suites developed by Good Hospitality Services. The company also has built this Hilton brand in downtown Indianapolis and at the Nashville airport, Good said.

Good has another Home2 Suites hotel in pre-development on Colonial Boulevard in Fort Myers next to a Hampton Inn & Suites the company also developed. Phoenix Associates also is the contractor to build that hotel.

“We’re about a month and a half away from breaking ground,” Good said.

Over the hill

Q: What is going on with the hills of concrete and dirt on the southwest corner of Industrial and Mercantile in Naples? It looks like the heavy equipment is removing this dangerous eyesore in the industrial park. What are the plans for the property?

— Ed T., East Naples

A: That pile of debris in the East Naples industrial park may not be quite as towering, but it’s not going to disappear anytime soon.

That landmark at Industrial Boulevard and Mercantile Avenue is part of the Cadenhead Brothers recycling, demolition and excavation business that has operated there for a half-century.

The mountain of concrete and debris on the southwest corner of Industrial Boulevard and Mercantile Avenue in East Naples is part of the Cadenhead family's recycling business. (Photo: Tim Aten/Daily News)

“I have an operational license for recycling there. The concrete will be recycled and shipped out,” said owner Bobby Cadenhead Sr. “We started off there in 1969. We do a lot of demolition.”

Cadenhead, 73, said the old concrete from demolition jobs will be reprocessed, refined and screened to standard specifications and end up as the foundation and fill for new developments around town.

“It’s not really an eyesore. It was there at the beginning and it is what it is. It’s a recycling operation,” he said.

All agree, though, that the mountain slope has gotten a little out of hand and is potentially dangerous, so Cadenhead will reduce it enough to satisfy a Collier County engineer.

“We’ve had complaints over the years over it. He knows it has gotten out of hand. Hopefully, it will look a lot better in the near future,” said Jeff Letourneau, investigative supervisor for Collier County Code Enforcement.

Cadenhead’s father had Naples’ first contractor’s license, issued in 1943, Cadenhead said. The family’s construction business didn’t locate to the industrial park between Airport-Pulling and Livingston roads — the industrial park grew around them, he said.

“That was there before anything was built in the industrial park,” he said. “I built the industrial park. There was nothing there before I started in there.”

Nevertheless, his corner has had at least 20 code enforcement entries or inspections since 2007 for piles of debris, fence disrepair or excessive vegetation growth. However, county officials recognize that Cadenhead is operating a legitimate business there.

“He’s grandfathered in on that property. He has several business tax receipts from way back in the early ’70s,” Letourneau. “You couldn’t start up something like that now. You’d be in code violation.”

1241,Locals react as Tiger Woods wins first Masters since 2005,"CLOSE Tiger Woods won his fifth green jacket at the Masters and was thrilled his family was there to celebrate with him. Golfweek, USA Today Sports

Former Florida State star Brooks Koepka proved on Sunday he’s one of the top golfers in the world.

Tiger Woods proved he’s one of the best all-time.

In what’s being billed by many as the greatest comeback in sports history, Woods won the Masters to capture his fifth green jacket and 15th major title.

Woods overtook 54-hole leader Francesco Molinari and held off Koeopka, Dustin Johnson and Xander Schauffele by 1 stroke.

USA Today: Christine Brennan: Woods completes sports comeback for ages with fifth Masters victory

“Once that door opens, he was amazing,” FSU men’s golf coach Trey Jones said of Woods.

“He’s such a great frontrunner. He got the lead, and it was done. It’s amazing how he does that.”

It was the first major title since 2008 for Woods, once golf’s most dominant player.

However, a sex scandal, injuries and other challenges led many to believe Woods would never again play at an elite level.

“It’s phenomenal,” said Kenny Knox, a former golfer at FSU and a Tallahassee resident who played in his first and only Masters in 1987 (tied for 47th).

“I never thought Tiger would win again a couple of years ago, and now look what he has done. It’s absolutely incredible.”

Knox, 62, recalled playing in an exhibition with Woods during Woods’ first year on the PGA Tour in 1996.

The exhibition led into the Quad City Classic (now the John Deere Classic) and featured 10 players on the same hole. The player with the highest score was eliminated after each hole.

Knox said he was among the final three with Woods and Andrew Magee.

“We had a chip-off and I chipped within four feet,” Knox said. “But they both chipped inside of me, so I was eliminated. We talked and I offered him (Woods) some advice, but he looked at me like I was crazy,"" Knox added with a laugh.

Knox, like the rest of the golfing world, has watched Woods’ career path take him to the highest of highs, and the lowest of lows.

Woods was back on top at the Masters.

Woods, 43, shot 13 under for the tourney. He last captured a major title in 2008 at the U.S. Open and hadn’t won a Masters since 2005.

“I think he’s better now than he has ever been,” said Knox, a three-time winner on the PGA Tour.

Knox also pointed to Woods' personal and professional struggles over the past decade, saying. ""I think America is the most forgiving nation in the world. I think Tiger has paid his dues. I think golf was fine without him but even better now with him.""

There also will be renewed interest in Woods' quest to top Jack Nicklaus’s 18 major titles. Knox described the duo was ""equally great"" and expects Woods to be remembered as ""one of the two greatest golfers ever.""

Local golfer Jay Revell, who recalled as a youth sitting with his family in the living room watching Woods win his first Masters in 1997, also marveled at Woods’ performance Sunday.

“Tiger is still the only golfer with the ability to grab the world’s attention,” Revell said.

“Not just the golf world, the whole world. For him to do that again, capture our hearts and imaginations another time, is something no fan will ever forget. To the casual observer, it may seem like a grand finale to his career, but I have a feeling it’s just the beginning of his third act.”

The next act also expects to continue for Koepka, currently ranked fourth in the world rankings. The back-to-back U.S. Open champion and defending PGA champ, Koepka, 28, was looking to win his fourth major in less than two years Sunday.

""You always want to have a chance, and he certainly did and was only a shot or two away,"" said Jones, who did not attend the Masters but communicated via text with Koepka early in the tourney.

""He looks great. I think he continues to solidify himself as one of the top five players in the world. Getting there is one thing, but continuing to do it is really hard.""

1244,"Couple adopts 7 kids, who are siblings, on top of the 10 they already have","- An Arkansas couple has adopted seven siblings who otherwise may have been split up into different adoptive homes.

Lisa Fulbright and her husband, Gary, officially adopted the siblings on Wednesday afternoon.

Lisa spoke to Fox 35 and said that her and her husband decided to adopt the seven children because ""we knew they more than likely would be separated into different adoptive homes."" She continued, stating that she and Gary felt that ""they needed each other and to stay together. The only way to do that was to adopt all seven of them.""

Lisa and Gary were actually fostering the siblings prior to adopting them. She said that they have had the older five for almost two years and that they got the youngest two about a year ago. The oldest sibling is 12-years-old and the youngest is three-years-old.

Lisa said that fostering them has been tough sometimes but that her and Gary ""love them all unconditionally."" She also said that the kids are ""worth it"" and raising them ""keeps both of us young.""

The older kids reportedly told Lisa and Gary that they have never really been anywhere. So, the couple has taken the kids to several 'firsts,' including their first movie, their first time ice skating, and their first time bowling. Lisa said that ""our big dream is to someday take them to Disney World!""

Lisa and Gary already have ten other children, including two adopted siblings and a young child that her and her husband had biologically. Now, with the additional seven siblings, they have a total of 17 kids. Seven of them are alreadly living out of their home though.

Lisa and Gary have spoken very highly of their seven new additions, saying that they are caring, helpful, sweet, and full of energy.

1246,Some in Sylvania Heights oppose FWB annexation,"FORT WALTON BEACH — Chris Macaulay, who along with his family has lived for the past couple years in unincorporated Sylvania Heights, strongly opposes its possible annexation into Fort Walton Beach.

The Sylvania Heights neighborhood, which has almost 300 properties including homes, churches and businesses, is west of Mary Esther Cut-Off and north of Lovejoy Road.

City officials “want to annex it and make it industrial,” Macaulay said Wednesday. “A lot of people are saying (Fort Walton Beach officials) want to put in low-income housing projects.”

He said other than one couple, no Sylvania Heights residents support annexation. Many residents have signed a petition in opposition, Macaulay said.

“Our taxes would go way up, and there would be no extra service” if the neighborhood is annexed into the city, he said.

The Fort Walton Beach City Council agreed in February to have a special meeting this spring to discuss the costs and benefits of possibly annexing Sylvania Heights.

While a date for the special meeting hasn’t been set yet, the session might take place in May, city spokesman Doug Rainer said. He added that the council has not discussed any rezoning of Sylvania Heights should it get annexed.

Greater Sylvania Heights Front Porch community improvement organization member Barry Gray has said that by being in the city, the neighborhood could enjoy benefits such as possibly having better success at getting stormwater problems in the Gap Creek watershed addressed.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190411/some-in-sylvania-heights-oppose-fwb-annexation?rssfeed=true,2019-04-11T16:09:24Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
1247,"Santa Rosa County will pay Milton couple $15,000 after their house flooded in 2017","CLOSE Early morning storms caused parts of Pace and Milton to wake up with flooding in yards and a washed out highway. Brandon Girod/cgirod@pnj.com

Santa Rosa County Commissioners will settle a $15,000 lawsuit with a Milton couple who said it was the county's fault that their home flooded in a June 2017 rainstorm.

Commissioners unanimously approved the settlement at Thursday morning's meeting at the recommendation of county attorney Roy Andrews, who said the settlement would save the county from future litigation costs. The settlement also absolves the county of any responsibility for the flooding.

“The decision is based purely on the economics involved in the resolution of the claim,” Andrews told the board at the meeting. “Santa Rosa County is not admitting any type of liability whatsoever, and under the provisions of the settlement agreement, it is not permissible in any other proceedings.”

June 2017 flooding: Record rain falls in Santa Rosa County in June

The lawsuit was filed by James and Joy Cowart, who own a home on Foxfire Lane in Milton. Their home flooded during a rainstorm on June 6, 2017, according to county records, and the Cowarts, through their attorney, alleged the flooding was caused due to lack of maintenance of the county’s drainage system.

The couple originally sought $65,000 in damages, but agreed to settle the claim for $15,000.

The settlement will be paid from the county's self-insurance fund.

Andrews said the couple's attorney had an expert witness who could testify to the lack of drainage maintenance, and the county would incur fees related to finding their own expert witness.

District 2 Commissioner Bob Cole was outspoken against the settlement at Monday's committee meeting, saying it would open the county up to lawsuits whenever a resident's home flooded. But he walked back on those comments Thursday, saying he did his homework and determined the settlement would be a reasonable move on the county's part.

“I don’t like to roll over on something like this, but understanding it better now, we’re not just going to throw in the towel every chance we get,” Cole said. “And this lets Public Works off the hook, because there is no claim of responsibility. I’ll keep my mouth shut after this.”

The News Journal has reached out to the Cowarts' attorney, Darryl Steve Traylor Jr., for comment.

1255,"U.S. deports spouse of fallen soldier, quickly reverses decision","Immigration officials last week deported the spouse of a U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan in 2010, leaving the couple's 12-year-daughter in Phoenix, then abruptly reversed its decision on Monday when the deported man was allowed to return to the U.S.

Jose Gonzalez Carranza, 30, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers last Monday on his way to his welding job and then deported to Nogales, Sonora, early Thursday morning, according to Gonzalez Carranza and his attorney, Ezequiel Hernandez.

Gonzalez Carranza was married to Army Pfc. Barbara Vieyra, who was killed on Sept. 18, 2010, while serving in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. She was 22.

During an interview, Gonzalez Carranza told The Arizona Republic he was allowed to re-enter the U.S. through the DeConcini port of entry in Nogales, Arizona Monday afternoon.

He said he was then driven back to Phoenix where ICE officials dropped him off at the agency's headquarters near downtown.

ICE officials offered no explanation for the decision to allow Gonzalez Carranza to return to the U.S. But Hernandez believes the reversal was triggered by media attention the deportation received.

UPDATE: His wife died fighting for the U.S., then the U.S. deported him

Gonzalez Carranza said he was eager to see his daughter, who lives with her grandparents.

He said he had not told her he had been deported because he was afraid she would be further traumatized after the loss of her mother.

Reached by phone earlier Monday in Nogales, Gonzalez Carranza said he had been living in a shelter for deported migrants in Nogales, Mexico, a city he didn't know, and was worried about his daughter, Evelyn Gonzalez Vieyra, a U.S. citizen.

""I feel so bad,"" Gonzalez Carranza said. ""I'm thinking about, I might never see her again.""

Hernandez said it seemed cruel for ICE to inflict additional pain on the man and his daughter, noting the trauma they experienced after the death of his spouse.

""There are plenty of people you can go after but not a guy whose wife died in Afghanistan,"" he said.

Vieyra was mortally wounded when insurgents attacked her unit using an improvised explosive device and rocket-propelled grenade fire in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, the Pentagon said at the time. Her unit had been sent to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director at the ACLU, said she could not recall a similar deportation. She said the deportation was unnecessary.

“It’s the height of cruelty for ICE to deport the father of a child whose mother died while serving in the U.S. army in Afghanistan,"" Wang said. ""The government can exercise its discretion not to pursue deportation against the sole remaining parent of a U.S. citizen child under these circumstances.""

DIAZ: ICE should've never deported husband of fallen soldier

SEE ALSO:A deported Arizona mom makes new life in Mexico but misses kids 'dearly'

Gonzalez Carranza said he came to the U.S. illegally from Veracruz, Mexico, in 2004, when he was a teenager. He said he and Vieyra married in 2007.

After his wife was killed in Afghanistan, Gonzalez Carranza was granted what is known as parole in place, which allows immigrants in the country illegally to remain in the U.S. without the threat of deportation, Hernandez said.

For more stories that matter, subscribe to azcentral.com.

An immigration judge then terminated deportation proceedings against Gonzalez Carranza based on the parole in place, Hernandez said.

However, ICE refiled the case in 2018, Hernandez said.

A judge ordered Gonzalez Carranza deported in December 2018 after Hernandez didn't show up for his court hearing, Hernandez said.

But the reason Gonzalez Carranza didn't show up is because he never received the notice, Hernandez said. He said ICE sent it to the wrong address.

Gonzalez Carranza didn't find out a judge had ordered him deported until ICE officers came to his house last Monday and took him into custody, Hernandez said.

Hernandez said he filed a motion to reopen Gonzalez Carranza's deportation case. The motion triggered an automatic stay of removal, but ICE deported him anyway, Hernandez said.

Wang also said it Gonzalez Carranza should not have been deported if there was a stay of removal. She said, however, it is ""not uncommon"" for ICE to violate stays of removal.

On Monday, Hernandez sent out a news release to draw attention to Gonzalez Carranza's case.

Hernandez said he can't understand why ICE deported him. Gonzalez Carranza has no criminal record, he said.

""This guy's wife died in action in Afghanistan,"" he said.

After speaking to The Arizona Republic, Hernandez said he received a call from an ICE officer who told him the agency was making arrangements to allow Gonzalez Carranza back into the United States.

Shortly after, Gonzalez Carranza was handcuffed at the border crossing in Nogales by Customs and Border Protection officers and allowed into the U.S., Hernandez said. He was then transported to CBP offices in Tucson, he said.

ICE officials then told Hernandez that Gonzalez Carranza would be transported back to Phoenix later tonight and then released on his own recognizance, Hernandez said.

ICE officials did not immediately provide information on the case, but a spokeswoman for Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., said Sinema's office had reached out to help.

“Our office is in communication with Mr. Carranza’s attorney and we will assist the Carranza family in this process,"" Sinema spokeswoman Hannah Hurley said in an email.

Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz., decried the ""un-American"" immigration and border actions taken under President Donald Trump.

""I'm relieved to now learn that Mr. Gonzalez has beeon allowed to re-enter the states and be reunited with his daughter, but to story of his arrest is just another example of the president's inhumane immigration policies,"" Kirkpatrick said in a written statement.

Barbara Vieyra’s sister says family tried to keep mom's memory alive for her daughter, Evelyn

Barbara Vieyra’s sister, Guadalupe, said Gonzalez Carranza sees his daughter occasionally on weekends.

Vieyra did not know Gonzalez Carranzahad been deported until a reporter knocked on her door Monday night. She called her parents, who said they did not learn of the situation until Monday morning.

Guadalupe is one year younger than her sister and said her family does the best they can to keep Barbara’s memory alive for Evelyn.

“When she was 3, she was too young to know what happened, but now she’s almost a teenager,” she said. “We talk about it all the time. We celebrate my sister’s birthday and the anniversary of her death because we want my niece to know her mother died fighting for her country.”

These are some of the photos taken inside the Cathedral de Notre Dame de Paris during a vespers concert I saw in October 2016. We were wandering around like a couple of goofballs when we came upon Notre Dame. I gasped, ""That's beautiful.""

My friend saw people in line at the door, and we assumed it was for a tour. But when we got to the entrance, we learned there was a symphonic concert starting in moments and we were fortunate they still had tickets available. So we got to hear a concert inside the cathedral, and it was one of the most moving experiences of my life.

Took these pics just two years ago. Hard to believe it is destroyed.There is one I particularly like, of four statues rising up the spire that collapsed earlier today. I think that these statues were removed by cranes prior to the renovation work, so they may not have been destroyed.

I traveled to Paris at 15 on a school trip. At the Louvre, I kept following signs for the “Galerie Sortie”. With so many signs, I was sure it must be very popular. I later discovered “sortie” means “exit.” The next day a friend and I set out with a map to explore the city but quickly found ourselves with no idea where we were or how to get back. (I really should have learned some basic French.) We happened upon the gorgeous Sainte-Chapelle just as the sun broke through the overcast sky to shine through its many stained glass windows. I’ve never been so beautifully lost in my life.

We watched the artist paint this beautiful picture of the back of Notre Dame in 1997. It's always been one of my favorite pieces of art. Now it is even more treasured. Amazingly, the name is actually legible: Maurice T.

He was a young French street artist. I remember watching him and really liking his technique. I didn't have enough French francs to pay for what he was asking but I had some pounds and also American money that he accepted to meet his price!

I’m not French.

I’m not Catholic.

I’ve never even been to France to see the Notre Dame Cathedral.

But I still have shed tears this afternoon watching it burn.

A masterpiece of architecture & history is dying in front of our eyes.

I went on a trip to Notre Dame with my grandma in September 2018. The trip was a college graduation present from her to me, as I had minored in French and just graduated that August. It was an honor to tour the Notre Dame with her, and I'm saddened to know that if I ever return to Paris, this sacred piece of the city's rich history will never be the same.

Ange Belanger Casey

I remember trying to walk around the exterior of Notre Dame and being in awe of the architecture. It wasn’t just the immensity of this Gothic cathedral that impressed me, but also the buttresses, the gargoyles, the statues, the stone and the bell towers. The plaza at the entrance was usually crowded with visitors and residents alike. I found a seat near the plaza once and just sat and enjoyed watching people congregating there. Although I did walk through the very crowded nave once, the image imprinted on my memory is the sight of Notre Dame at sunrise as my taxi took me to the airport to catch a flight back to Florida. Paris, to me, has a pearly light. But that morning, the sky around Our Lady was streaked with pink contrasting with the blue of the Seine River. I sighed with sadness that I had to leave. But I was determined to keep that iconic image of Paris in my mind, Notre Dame with the snaking Seine River at dawn. I will be back, I thought. I will see this again. If I ever go back now, a great part of that image will be gone.

I have been to Paris many times over the past 10 years, mostly with student groups. As a history teacher, it is unfortunate to see such an icon destroyed. Notre Dame is the literal center of Paris and the site of so much human significance. It is a sad day indeed.

I got engaged in Paris, in April 1995. We had very little money, since we were both in grad school. We followed Rick Steves' guide faithfully (we called it a forced march) through Paris — and of course we visited Notre Dame — a ""must see"" marvel. I'm so sad not to have returned in the 24 years since.

Bill Wharton had two albums released in France in the 1990s. The first was called ""Miami Blues and Liquid Summer"" (which was originally released in the U.S. as ""Sauce Boss""). The second was released in France on Virgin Records ""South of the Blues."" He and his band toured in France about a dozen times, and regularly performed in Paris. We are crushed to see the Notre Dame in flames. He and I climbed to the top of one of the towers on our first trip to France in 1992. Sauce Boss and his band The Ingredients had just played the night before at New Morning, not far from the cathedral. This is a photo we took toward the back showing the spire that fell.

I visited in 1988, and was astounded with the beauty of all the stained glass especially the dome. Absolutely breathtaking! I’m visiting Paris next month and was planning on seeing the cathedral again. My heart goes out to the French. Heartbreaking.

In 1995 I was in 10th grade and I took a trip to Spain and France with about 100 kids from my school. The trip was a blur of no sleep, exchanging money, homesickness, feeling like I couldn’t find anything I wanted to eat and more freedom than I had ever come close to tasting before that. I remember the day we visited Notre Dame, and feeling in awe of it. For some reason the gargoyles are always what have stuck out most in my memory. I’m sad I won’t ever get to go back and experience it as an adult, when I know I would have appreciated it even more. I couldn’t wait to get home from that trip and see my boyfriend (who kissed someone else while I was gone by the way).

I have visited Notre Dame three times in my life (1982, 1997, 2017). The people who began to build Notre Dame, by hand in 1163, knew they would never worship in the Cathedral. Yet they continued building this treasure for future generations. It took several centuries to complete. It is so much more than a active church and historic landmark. It is awe inspiring architecture. It is History Personified. It is Faith It is Paris. It is Us.

Notre Dame, 2008: We went up into the bell tower. Lots of steps to climb and I don't think I could do it now, not without resting often — which ticks off the people behind you! I wanted to see the gargoyles and the bells. I am so sad about the fire. That was the last time I was there.

'Today's loss hurts so much': Tour guides heartbroken, shocked by Notre Dame fire

Bow, No Arrow

I never paid to climb you cause

I thought you were a tourist trap,

but now I know why

the gargoyles always looked tortured;

they would weep today

if they could keep their eyes

open.

You were there 300,000 yesterdays;

I admit I expected a few more tomorrows.

But now you are mostly

dead.

The red and black and smoke and

yellow spitfire

leap toward God

off of Paris’ heart,

beating too fast now.

The arrow is burnt,

and the bow lay empty

in our trembling hands

on the day the Notre Dame came down.

1259,Triple-murder suspect said argument sparked killings,"On Facebook, Ernst Cherizard told followers: ""IDK what happened all I know is we were fighting for the gun then I lost it.""

HAINES CITY — Ernst Cherizard had been on the run from authorities for hours when he went on Facebook early Saturday to talk about what had happened.

He said he had been planning to visit with his daughter, whom he hadn't seen since 2015. His current girlfriend, Eli Junia Normil, became jealous when he spoke with the daughter's mother, Cherizard wrote.

An argument and scuffle ensued inside the Citrus Ridge Apartments then Cherizard said he became overcome with anger.

""IDK what happened all I know is we were fighting for the gun then I lost it,"" Cherizard wrote on Facebook.

Authorities said he shot and killed Normil, 23, and critically wounded her daughter, 6-year-old Elizabelle Frenel, who was shot in the temple, face and arm. The girl was pronounced dead late Saturday night at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando.

After the initial two shootings, police said he fired two shots, killing Normil's aunt, Nicole Guillume, 48, after she had knocked on their apartment door searching for her niece.

He then ran to Normil's Nissan Altima about 7:30 p.m. and sped away, leading law enforcement on a manhunt to South Florida until he turned himself in to Haines City Police Sunday afternoon.

""I don't have much light to shed on it,"" Police Chief Jim Elensky said Monday when asked about more details. ""He's a monster.""

Jake Orr, a spokesman with the State Attorney's Office, said in the coming weeks the agency will determine if they will seek the death penalty against Cherizard for the three deaths. During his first appearance Monday, Cherizard was charged by Haines City Police with three counts of first-degree murder.

In the Facebook post, Cherizard, 38, went on to say he deserves the ""worst that's coming for me nothing less.""

""And one thing plz Guys don't keep no guns at your home man fr I we had 2 guns one for me n look now what happen I ---- my life up and the one I truly love and care bout I don't think my kids deserve this at all they won't know their mom this is pure evil and I'm not a evil person at All,"" Cherizard wrote. ""I took a great person live from you now it's time for me to pay for what I've done.""

In addition to more details about a motive, Elensky said detectives were still trying to piece together if Elizabelle was shot before her mother. The Altima was found in Miami and planned to be returned to Haines City this week.

Cherizard and Normil had 8-month-old twins together. The girl and boy were sleeping in another unit with relatives at the complex when the shootings occurred, Elensky said.

Normil's older sister, Ania Normil, said her sister rarely spoke about any strife with her boyfriend. She remembered hearing her older brother, Dominique, talk about the couple's spats.

""He told her that if you don't want to stay together, leave him,"" Ania Normil said.

As Ania mourned the death of her sister and niece so did classmates and her kindergarten teachers at Alta Vista Elementary.

In a statement, Alta Vista Principal Celeste Stewart wrote Elizabelle was outgoing, enjoyed dancing and loved to help her classmates after she finished her own work.

""Her teacher said this was almost like having another little teacher in the classroom,"" Stewart wrote.

Counselors were on the school grounds to help teachers and students.

""Elizabelle was a beautiful little girl who was sweet, kind and intelligent,"" Stewart wrote. ""She will be greatly missed by her classmates and the entire school community.""

1263,Rickards baseball hunting 'good long string of district titles',"The Raiders are 12-4 one year after winning 19 games and reaching a regional final for the first time in school history

When Rickards’ baseball team walked off the field for the last time during the 2018 season, it was with pride for all it had accomplished.

The Raiders reached their first regional final in school history – a 3-0 loss to powerhouse prep school Jacksonville Bolles – and won a school-record 19 games in addition to breaking a 10-year streak in between district titles.

Despite losing several top seniors such as pitcher/shortstop Ferante Cowart and first baseman Mark Thornhill, Rickards is 12-4 with seven regular-season games to play.

“We ain’t as athletic as we were last year and we’re young, but we have a lot of pitching depth and we’re probably more fundamentally sound,” said Rickards head coach Brian Kelley, the 2018 All-Big Bend Coach of the Year. “We feel good about this team.”

Rickards plays at Suwannee (12-5) tonight in a game that could preview a Region 1-5A final, should either team get that far. Or Bolles (15-2) and senior pitcher Hunter Barco could still be the team to beat.

But don’t tell that to the Raiders.

“We have a lot of fight, probably more fight than last year,” sophomore Will Brown said. “We’re a young team, but we have a lot of potential. Our pitching is real good and we’re starting to wake up the bats. I think we have a good shot at winning something big this year.”

Brown is coming off a fantastic summer in which he was named Babe Ruth 15U World Series MVP while leading Tallahassee-Leon Babe Ruth to the championship title.

After a solid freshman campaign that was sandwiched around an injury that kept him out 14 games, Brown has taken his average up from .273 to .388 with a couple home runs and five doubles.

“Winning MVP over there, I felt like I stepped up a little more over the summer,” Brown said. “I learned about family. And Coach Kelley showed me little things. I brought that into school ball and it works.”

Brown and fellow sophomore Kaleb Henry have emerged as team leaders. Brown has moved from the outfield to shortstop to fill the hole left by Cowart.

Henry, who hit a two-run home run in Rickards’ three-inning 18-0 win over Gadsden County – is hitting .389, up from .256 last year.

“Will is definitely special,” Kelley said. “Him and Kaleb are two special players. Will just works at it. He gets here and works on the tee, he does everything he’s supposed to do.”

Said Henry: “This has been my dream since I was younger. I watched Jose Reyes in MLB and Mallex Smith play for Rickards. It has been my dream ever since . . . This is a new team. We don’t have any big seniors like last year, but we’re going to stick it to them.”

On the mound, Brown is 3-1 with a 1.89 ERA and two saves. Junior Michael-Todd Reed is 3-1 with a 3.69 ERA, and senior Blountstown transfer Jacen White is 3-2 with a 3.60 ERA. The Raiders have also gotten good outings recently from junior Nevan Figueroa, and senior Justin Huber worked two innings of a team no-hitter against Gadsden County.

With junior catcher Jayden Figueroa batting .362 and Reed hitting .353, Rickards’ team average is .314, better than its .264 mark from a year ago but with less contribution driving in runs.

“We haven’t been great offensively,” Kelley said. “I think it’s our (plate) approach. It’s a team mentality, not a ‘me’ mentality. We’ve had some guys trying to hit it out of the park that don’t need to be trying. If we get two strikes, we need to shorten up and put it in play. When we have runners in scoring position, we need to get them in. I don’t need a three-run homer, I need a single, I need a sac fly.”

Buy Photo Rickards head coach Brian Kelley watches as the Raiders' baseball team beat Gadsden County 18-0 in three innings on Friday, April 12, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Kelley said he saw team play in a 6-5 win over Florida High last week. And that is ideally a sign of things to come as the Raiders inch towards their district tournament.

“Godby is better and can beat you, and Marianna beat us, so we can’t look ahead,” Kelley said. “We have to take it step by step. Obviously, we want to make the playoffs again. The South Walton team we played last year has a lot of the same guys back and will be tough to beat. But you’ve got to get out of the district first.”

Rickards went 10 years in between district titles, so its goal is immediate. Win another.

And with the program taking a major leap forward last year prior to opening a brand-new facility next year, the Raiders can set up an even brighter future by achieving the minor goals before the big one.

“We want to put together a good long string of district titles,” Kelley said. “And we definitely want to make playoff runs. If you make the playoffs, you’re in the (district) championship game.

“Those are our goals – No. 1, make the playoffs, and No. 2, win a district title.”",http://rssfeeds.tallahassee.com/~/600828556/0/tallahassee/home~Rickards-baseball-hunting-aposgood-long-string-of-district-titlesapos/,2019-04-14T16:01:37Z,Tallahassee Democrat,Couple,"277 N Magnolia Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA",FL,32301

After racing in 17 consecutive Boston Marathons, Jack McDermott knows No. 18 on Monday brings three certainties:

Crowds, hills and unpredictable weather.

“Right now, the weather’s nice,” McDermott said Sunday morning from Boston as he watched his niece’s youth soccer match.

“But the last weather forecast I saw for (Monday) was for rain and a little warmer temps. But this is Boston. The weather’s always unpredictable.”

Don’t worry, Mother Nature won’t ruin the experience for the 50-year-old McDermott.

McDermott and wife Laura – Tallahassee’s marathon couple – help headline a local contingent entered in one of the world’s most prestigious marathons.

For Jack McDermott, Boston will be his 225th marathon, including ultra-distances.

He’s coming off a 100-mile race in Knoxville, Tennessee, where he averaged a 10-minute pace and finished fourth overall. McDermott says he feels fine physically.

“It has been a month since the 100-mile race so I think I am OK,” McDermott said and laughed. “I guess I will find out (Monday).”

The National Weather Service has called for a period of showers with embedded heavy rain and possibly thunderstorms Sunday night that will continue into Monday afternoon.

The temperature is expected to be in the upper 40s to 50 around the race’s 9 a.m. start. Highs Monday afternoon are expected to reach the mid 60s.

More than 30,000 runners are entered in the 123rd annual race. They will take off from Hopkinton, west of Boston, and look to finish on Boylston Street in Boston.

While the 26.2-mile race takes runners downhill for much of the course, the late five-miles through Newton features a series of challenging hills. Of course, there's the infamous Heartbreak Hill, the steep, half-mile incline at mile 20 in the race.

“Once you get here, it’s a big celebration,” said Laura McDermott, 39, competing in her fourth consecutive Boston Marathon.

“It’s really exciting, you try to enjoy the experience. It’s a very uplifting race. You just try to do the best you can.”

Laura doesn’t have to look very far for motivation, from her husband to her running coach Albert Wieringa. The 72-year-old Wieringa, of St. Petersburg, is entered despite undergoing major surgery for a twisted colon following last year’s race.

Mickey Moore, 49, is entered in the race for the first time since 2014. Despite undergoing knee surgery last December, Moore feels comfortable with eight weeks of training behind him. Moore needs to finish in three hours, 25 minutes to re-qualify for next year's race.

""I feel good. Nothing hurts right now the day before the race and that's important,"" Moore said Sunday as he enjoyed a bowl of clam chowder at a Boston area restaurant. ""I plan to be patient, and we'll see what happens.""

1267,Pilot details Daytona Beach Shores crash landing in Atlantic Ocean,"THE VILLAGES, Fla. - Dick Goosman vividly remembers how his three-hour flight from Columbia, South Carolina to Spruce Creek Landing in Port Orange was cut 10 minutes short.

""A couple seconds later, the engine stopped,"" Goosman said. ""No decision to be made - it was going to go into the water.""

His small plane crash-landed in the water just 100 feet off Daytona Beach Shores in October. Goosman, a pilot with 30 years of experience, was in the process of moving from North Carolina to Florida with his wife, and had been on his way to sell his plane to a dealer in Volusia County.

""You talk about panic-- it was, for an instant, but not much more,"" he said.

When the plane first hit the water, Goosman watched as the plane started to sink, and he struggled to find a way out.

""The plane was filling up with water. Then panic started,"" he said. ""I got to the point where I thought I was going to go down, sink and drown, after I made a successful crash. It was filling up with water, and sinking is enough to put panic into anybody.""

Out of frustration, Goosman banged his legs against the plane door, and broke a window, through which he was able to escape. At that point, Goosman was unaware of how close he was to the shore.

""I was on my own and suddenly I wasn't,"" he said. ""I saw the lifeguards and, oh, my God, it was a relief to see them. I had no expectation of seeing them.""

Goosman was taken to the hospital with only a few scrapes and cuts and was released hours later. He hasn't given up his love of flying; he flew in a P-51 Warbird this past February.

The Federal Aviation Administration told News 6 it is still investigating the October crash but a preliminary report points out that there were still 3.5 gallons of fuel left in the plane when the engine stopped, which was more than enough for Goosman to reach his destination.

Wendy Williams has reportedly filed for divorce from her husband of 21 years, Kevin Hunter, according to Page Six. Together, they have a 19-year-old son, Kevin Hunter Jr.The news was allegedly confirmed to the outlet by Williams' attorney Thursday. A source told Page Six that the talk show host gave Hunter divorce papers at 6:30 a.m. ET.The following statement was released to People in light of the news:“Thank you to everyone for respecting the family’s privacy during this time. Hunter is supportive of Williams and they are working through this process together,” the rep for Williams told the publication. “No additional comment will be provided at this time.”People notes that a rep for ""The Wendy Williams Show"" also issued a statement: “Wendy and her family have been a part of Debmar-Mercury for over 10 years. We respect their privacy regarding personal matters. As always, we remain committed to bringing an entertaining and topical show to our viewers.”Loyal Williams fans have stood by the talk show host’s side as she experienced many difficulties starting in December 2018. What began as a shoulder injury led to more health problems, including complications due to Graves’ disease. She eventually returned to her show on March 4, 2019 — three months after her originally scheduled date.On her first episode back, Williams briefly spoke about Hunter. “I want to shout out to my husband. I’m still wearing my ring,” she said. “He’s my best friend, he’s my lover. I know what you’ve been seeing ... but Hunty, let me show you who I fell in love with and who he fell in love with.”She went on to describe the hard work put into marriages and reassured the audience that hers remained strong.“Marriages have ebbs and flows, marriage isn’t easy. And don’t ask me about mine until you see this gone,” she added, gesturing to her wedding ring. “And it ain’t going anywhere, not in this lifetime.” Here’s some background info on the Queen of Tea's relationship with her soon-to-be ex-husband:1994: Williams and Hunter meet for the first timeAlthough there aren't too many details known about their first encounter, it’s reported that the two crossed paths at an ice skating rink after Williams was hired by a Philadelphia radio station. Hunter, who is originally from Canada, had dreams of becoming an actor and discovered his talent as a representative and producer along the way. Hunter eventually became Williams' agent. And when Williams was given her own daytime talk show in 2008, Hunter was made an executive producer.November 1997: Wendy and Kevin get marriedThree years after meeting, the successful radio personality married her agent on Nov. 30, 1997. But it wasn’t the first time she exchanged vows. In her 2004 biography, ""Wendy’s Got Heat,"" the 54-year-old revealed she had another husband before Hunter, Robert Morris III, describing him only as a salesperson.Williams' relationship with Hunter inspired her to be honest with her radio show audience. To relate to her listeners, she would reportedly share the couple's ups and downs on air. In turn, the hip-hop and R&B station peaked at No. 2 for ratings.August 2000: Williams gives birth to Kevin Hunter Jr.On Aug. 18, 2000, Williams and Hunter welcomed Kevin Hunter Jr. into the world. For the sake of her family, she decided to keep her son’s life as private as possible. In 2018, though, the beloved host revealed to Entertainment Tonight that when he was 14 her son had experimented with the K2 drug (synthetic cannabinoids).The same year, Williams and her son launched a national drug awareness campaign called “Be Here” to combat drug addiction and substance abuse — a struggle she experienced with cocaine. April 2019: Williams officially files for divorceOn April 11, 2019, Williams decided to call it quits with Hunter.

Daytona Beach police identified the woman as Alexis Carroll of Jacksonville.

The Daytona Beach News-Journal reported that an officer from Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue was patrolling Tuesday night and saw Carroll fall from the balcony at the Holiday Inn property.

Witnesses told investigators they heard a couple yelling in the room before the woman went onto the balcony.

Hotel security showed up and left. The woman returned to the balcony and yelled at the people next door for calling security.

Police said resort video cameras showed Carroll hanging off the balcony and her boyfriend trying about five times to pull her to safety.

1285,"College campus in Viera? Officials are in early talks, but no decisions have been made","CLOSE The Viera Co. hopes to add an urban-style college campus near The Avenue Viera, as seen March 11, 2019, in aerial drone photography. Maureen Kenyon and Xavier Mascareñas, Florida Today

The Viera Co. is in early negotiations with a couple of colleges in hopes of building a small campus just west of The Avenue Viera shopping complex.

""Our ultimate goal is to look for an urban campus post-secondary school here, where we can have a small college campus environment that becomes the anchor for the Town Center,"" said Scott Miller, vice president of sales and community management for The Viera Co.

However, no decisions have been made and the idea remains on the drawing board, said Todd Pokrywa, president of The Viera Co.

The Viera Town Center is slated for development as a downtown-like zone bounded by Lake Andrew Drive to the east, governmental buildings to the north, and Stadium Parkway to the west. The Centre Point and Marisol apartment complexes are located just to the south.

In May, the 116-room Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott opened here, across Lake Andrew Drive from the main entrance to The Avenue Viera. The target site for a college campus site — or undetermined future developments — is a 25-acre tract just to the west, abutting Stadium Parkway and the Duran Golf Club 9-hole short course-practice range.

""It would be premature to speculate about the ultimate uses that come to fruition, as they will be market-driven and there are no discussions with prospective colleges that have ripened to any contractual stage,"" Pokrywa said.

""However, The Viera Co. is seeking a mix of uses that will provide a synergistic benefit to the Viera Town Center and the overall community, now that the initial key anchors have been developed,"" he said.

Utility work and road building is underway for two Viera Town Center projects:

• A 118-room Home2 Suites by Hilton, just north of the Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott.

• A 240-unit multi-family apartment complex on 11.6 acres, just south of the Children's Medical Services building.

Davis Development, the firm that built the nearby Artistry at Viera apartments on Judge Fran Jamieson Way, will construct the 240-unit complex.

Additional Viera Town Center developments may include a small amphitheater inside a park, a restaurant-brewery overlooking a Rodina Drive lake, and additional retail, restaurants and office space, Miller said.

""I know our residents are eager to see restaurants and other things here. The key is, what drives restaurants is rooftops,"" Miller said.

""There is a significant number of rooftops that will be in close proximity to this: walking distance, or golf cart distance, or biking distance. And that'll really drive this and ensure that it's not just a lunch crowd coming here — but that this is an activated space after 5 o'clock,"" he said.

""If we did have a small college campus here, what's great is you have multi-family here that can serve as housing for that college campus,"" he said.

Viera: Viera Boulevard to be widened from two to four lanes near U.S. 1 in $2 million project

Estimated Home2 Suites completion date is spring 2020. The hotel will feature an outdoor pool and patio, equipped with two grills and a fire pit.

“This new pet-friendly hotel offers thoughtfully designed spacious suites and convenient, comfortable amenities that allow our guests to create their own ‘home away from home’ while traveling,"" Ronak Jasani, Sycamore Investment Group executive vice president, stated in a press release.

Home2 Suites is the third Viera hotel developed by Sycamore Investment Group. Pokrywa said the nearby USSSA Space Coast Complex is boosting demand for hotel construction.

According to People.com, Poppy's owner said that she was doing laundry and realized that the black-and-white furball was gone. After searching the house, the family discovered she was in the washing machine and were able to get her out before the spin cycle started.

Poppy had reportedly climbed into the machine to take a nap and went unnoticed when it was time to do the laundry.

“Meet poor little Poppy who miraculously survived a full wash cycle!” Animal Medical Centre in Launceston, Tasmania wrote in a Facebook post. “Poppy’s distressed owners phoned Dr. Lisa Towns for an after-hours consultation after finding her in the washing machine at the end of a full 30 minute cycle – ALIVE!”

Surprisingly, besides being bruised, sore and disoriented, the veterinarians said that Poppy had no broken bones. The lucky cat spent a couple of days in the veterinarian's care and was able to go home to her family.

""Surely this would equal around 7/9 cat lives?? We hope Poppy learnt her lesson and now realizes the washing machine certainly isn't a cozy place to sleep!""

1291,"Cape Coral stuns Riverdale, captures Battle of the Border title behind pitcher Lucas Carr","CLOSE Lucas Carr had an excellent outing for the Seahawks, going six innings, and keeping the Raiders in check. Alexander Martin, Fort Myers News-Press

Cape Coral has been known as having a gritty baseball team with a never quit mentality.

That was clearly present on Thursday night.

Cape Coral defeated Riverdale 10-7 to win the Battle of the Border Tournament, thanks in part to an excellent pitching performance from Lucas Carr. Carr who went six innings, gave up four hits, allowed three runs, and struck out four. Justin Slater went 2-for-3 at the plate with a double, a run batted in, and two runs scored.

""The outfield did an excellent job today,"" Carr said. ""They've been struggling a little bit, so it was good for them to come back and make a lot of great plays.

""I found my groove. I felt like I was in a rhythm all night. It felt good to be out there.""

Carr believes this game will help him and his teammates in the district tournament.

""I think it'll be great for us. We're really starting to get back into the groove. We had a little bit of a losing streak and some tough games. It's really good to beat a team like Riverdale just before districts start up next month.""

This is Cape Coral's first Battle of the Border title since 2015, when it defeated Canterbury 2-1. Former Seahawks pitcher and current Tampa Bay Rays minor-leaguer Shane McClanahan was a part of that team.

In the first two innings, it looked like Nelson Smith was going to have another solid outing for Riverdale, but that wasn't the case. Smith lasted five innings, allowed six hits and eight runs (two of which were earned) while striking out nine and walking one. Riverdale committed six errors.

Cape Coral coach Mark Gorton was pleased with the way his team has played of late.

""The guys are playing pretty good,"" Gorton said. ""There were a couple of games in the beginning of the year that were close games. A couple of mistakes determined those games, but I'm proud of the guys for not shutting down and really working hard to get these wins.""

Gorton was impressed with the way that Carr pitched against a strong team like Riverdale.

""Lucas throws strikes, so that's all we could ask for. He did a good job of rebounding after hitting the first guy in the first two innings. I knew I was going to get strikes out of him, but I didn't expect him to go that deep.

Cape Coral improved to 7-10 on the season, while Riverdale fell to 10-7.

1292,4 tips for relieving allergy symptoms during spring,"A cloud of pollen comes off the trees in Georgia as a helicopter flies by.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - If you're suffering from the seasonal sniffles, don't expect relief anytime soon.

Allergens like oak, juniper and bayberry have caused headaches and itchy eyes for many of you over the past couple of months, but in the coming weeks, the grass under your feet will be the source of your suffering.​

Currently, the highest concentrations of grass pollen stretch across the Deep South and into the Florida Panhandle.​

Here are four ways you can keep your symptoms at bay:

Stay inside in the morning : Pollen counts are highest in the early morning, between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. The best time to go outside is right after a heavy rain, as it washes the pollen out of the air.

: Pollen counts are highest in the early morning, between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. The best time to go outside is right after a heavy rain, as it washes the pollen out of the air. Keep indoor air clean : Close house and car windows when pollen counts are high. Use air conditioning in the car and at home to filter the pollen out of the air.

SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) - A nanny was arrested for child abuse after a couple came home to find both of their young children with significant bruises.

Sarai Rivera, 25, was arrested for child abuse and booked into the Sarasota County Jail on Tuesday.

Deputies said the 2-year-old boy and 8-month-old girl were admitted to Sarasota Memorial Hospital after their parents returned home from a date and saw bruising on the boy's neck and bruises on the girl's face and under her chin.

When questioned about the bruises, Rivera allegedly told the parents that the boy had thrown a toy at the girl and that the girl had been kissing the boy too hard and gave him a ""hickey"" by accident.

The children later underwent medical examinations at the Child Protection Center in Sarasota.

A forensic nurse told detectives that the bruising under the girl's chin was consistent with an intentional grab and that the bruise on her ear was likely from a grab or a pinch. The boy's bruises were also consistent with a pinch. The injuries were not accidental in nature, the nurse said.

Rivera later told deputies she was adjusting medications to cope with her depression, which sometimes caused her to ""snap"" and become ""irritable."" She also admitted to drinking rum after the couple left for the date and being intoxicated, the affidavit states.

Rivera said the baby started screaming and crying and she couldn't get her to stop, so she grabbed her by the chin out of frustration. Then she whipped her in the face with a towel twice, according to an affidavit.

Rivera said the boy's bruises were from a tickle game they were playing and that she may have pinched him or sucked his neck too hard, deputies said.

Rivera was booked into the Sarasota County Jail on two counts of child abuse. She also met the criteria for a Baker Act, which was completed.",https://www.wfla.com/news/sarasota-county/drunk-nanny-arrested-for-child-abuse-blamed-on-hickey-deputies-say/1917573950,2019-04-11T15:58:38Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

1303,Jury deliberations continue today in the John Jonchuck trial,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. - PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - John Jonchuck is accused of dropping his 5-year-old daughter Phoebe to her death off the Dick Misener Bridge near the Sunshine Skyway in St. Petersburg four years ago. Jonchuck's defense attorneys are trying to prove that he was insane when he killed his daughter. So far jurors have deliberated for three hours. They'll continue this morning at 9 a.m.

News Channel 8 has been in the courtroom every day for the trial. Here's what's happened so far.

DAY 15:

News Channel 8 is officially on verdict watch in the John Jonchuck murder trial. The jury began deliberations around 4:30 p.m. They decided to call it quits for the day before 7 p.m.

Before deliberations began, the jury heard closing arguments from state prosecutors and defense attorneys.

Each side had two hours to deliver their arguments. The state split its time.

State prosecutors began with their closing arguments. After the defense team delivered their closing arguments, state prosecutors had time to deliver a rebuttal.

After closing arguments wrapped, the judge read instructions to the jury and sent them to deliberate. The judge previously said jurors would be able to stay as long as they like or can choose to go home and come back Tuesday morning.

Deliberations are set to continue at 9 a.m. Tuesday.

DAY 14:

The defense rested its case on Friday in the John Jonchuck murder trial. The judge scheduled closing arguments for Monday morning.

Before the defense rested, jurors heard from Heather Davis, a counselor at the North Florida Evaluation and Treatment Center. Davis went over Jonchuck's medications and said he was having hallucinations at the hospital that included seeing dinosaurs in the parking lot.

Davis also testified saying she heard Dr. Emily Lazarou say ""she didn't need to evaluate him to know he didn't have a mental illness.""

Dr. Michael Maher was also called back to the stand. He answered questions from the defense and the state before taking questions from the jury.

DAY 13:

Dr. Emily Lazarou was back on the stand Thursday morning to continue her testimony.

Defense attorney Jessica Manuele brought up concerns about how Dr. Lazarou was dressed during a taped interview with Jonchuck at a mental hospital. Judge Helinger responded swiftly to shut down the argument.

""Let me say this - a woman's choice of attire, their hairstyle, all of that stuff I don't think is really relevant to anything,"" she said. ""I'm not gonna let her be attacked for her dress.""

The jury went on to watch the taped interview between Dr. Lazarou and Jonchuck.

The defense continued trying to poke holes in Dr. Lazarou's testimony throughout the day. They claim she wouldn't let Jonchuck finish his statements or wouldn't give him a chance to respond.

""He's responding to the question that I'm asking but in very short answers,"" Lazarou said. ""That whole interaction there, that's not how these interactions typically go.""

Attorneys also questioned Dr. Lazarou about her hours on the case, her qualifications and other defendants she's interviewed who were deemed incompetent.

At one point while Manuele was questioning her about her qualifications, Dr. Lazarou became emotional and broke into tears on the stand. She says she was not allowed to take an exam at one point during her career because she was breastfeeding at the time.

""(You are) involved in a lawsuit in which you are suing the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, correct?"" Manuele asked.

Dr. Lazarou clarified that she is a named plaintiff in the lawsuit.

""What I was asking for was for them to accommodate pregnant and breastfeeding women,"" she said. ""That was the reason for my complaint because they would not allow me to sit for the boards because they would not make an accommodation for me breastfeeding.""

DAY 12 RECAP:

The defense fought to keep Dr. Emily Lazarou's testimony out of court because they claim it's changed since her deposition before trial. She doesn't consider him to be mentally ill but says he has personality disorders.

Dr. Lazarou says Jonchuck is malingering psychotic symptoms, or exaggerating an illness he doesn't have. She ruled out Jonchuck having bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. She also claims his delusions were out of character for a psychotic patient.

The judge eventually decided to allow Dr. Lazarou to testify in front of the jury.

Before her testimony in front of the jury began, there was some drama with the jurors. One juror said they heard two people that looked like lawyers making jokes about the judge's appearance and Jonchuck's last name in the lunchroom and said it was very unprofessional.

That juror then told a second juror about the comments. The second juror was brought in to be questioned. Eventually, all of the jurors were brought in because everyone knew about the conversation. The judge asked all of the jurors if the comments would impact their judgment on the trial. All of the jurors responded that it would not.

Dr. Lazarou is due back on the stand at 9 a.m. Thursday.

DAY 11 RECAP:

Dr. Peter Bursten testified for a second day on the stand in the John Jonchuck murder trial. On Tuesday, he went over the PCL-R - a psychopathy checklist used to determine Jonchuck's mental state.

Bursten said Jonchuck fit a majority of the criteria and was experiencing various mental stages when he killed Phoebe in 2015.

""It would be easy to say all of those psychotic systems were present and therefore Mr. Jonchuck, because those symptoms were present, he had to be legally insane,"" Bursten said. ""Symptoms can be present but there are other variables present - again the presence of personality disorders, history of aggression, history of other anti-social types of behaviors.""

He described Jonchuck like a teapot - that his brain was starting to unravel.

""He believed, or he told myself and two other doctors that he had believed, he had engaged that behavior to save the world. He told one doctor he was God. Told me the devil was talking to him,"" said Bursten.

Bursten testified that Jonchuck had a sense of what was going on while on the bridge with Phoebe and police.

""He knew what he was doing and I believe he was telling the police officer, I'm gonna do what I'm going to do. You have no free will, stop me,"" said Dr. Bursten. ""So, I'm seeing a pattern here of a guy right up to the murder who has some appreciation of legal boundaries and legality or the illegal aspect of this behavior.""

Jurors will return Wednesday at 11 a.m. but attorneys will argue at 9 a.m.

DAY 10 RECAP:

Things became pretty heated in the courtroom in day 10 of testimony in the John Jonchuck murder trial.

Jonchuck's attorneys said allowing some of psychologist Dr. Peter Bursten's testimony into court would paint a negative picture for the jurors.

Bursten is the state's rebuttal witness. He evaluated Jonchuck after the murder of Phoebe and also spoke to Jonchuck's close friends and family.

Jonchuck's attorneys went back and forth with Judge Chris Helinger about using words like psychopathy and psychotic features to discuss his mental state.

His defense also objected to Dr. Bursten telling a story about a time when Jonchuck was 17 years old and put slippery polish on the staircase, which caused his uncle to fall and injure himself. The uncle claimed it was intentional at the time.

""Fell down the stairs and broke his rib and his arm,"" said Dr. Bursten.

""Was the defendant present for that? What was his reaction?"" asked prosecutor Doug Ellis.

""He laughed when that occurred,"" said Dr. Bursten.

Attorney Jessica Manuele said they wanted to redispose Dr. Bursten before trial resumed, but Judge Helinger wouldn't allow it.

The doctor testified that Jonchuck had poor emotional control and his mother said when Jonnchuck doesn't get his way, he acts out.

""She felt that Mr. Jonchuck was jealous of their relationship. She told me that right around that time, not that night, she said that Mr. Jonchuck said that everybody cares about the baby, no one cares about me,"" said Dr. Bursten.

Defense moved for a mistrial. Judge Helinger denied it.

A juror called out sick, therefore an alternate was assigned to the jury pool.

Court resumes Tuesday at 9 a.m.

DAY 8 RECAP:

After weeks of testimony, a juror had to be dismissed after the court learned he was no longer a Pinellas County resident. When the judge asked how he got his summons, the juror said it was sent in the mail to his new address in Trinity.

""I brought it too and I showed it to the lady at the jury assembly line and I said, 'Should I go to Pasco?' and she said, 'No you're here, this is the right number,'"" the dismissed juror said.

Judge Helinger thanked the juror for his time but explained it could be a problem.

""It probably would not be an issue, but if Mr. Jonchuck is convicted, that could be an appellate issue,"" she explained.

Once court resumed, the defense played video of Jonchuck's first appearance for jurors. The judge was trying to appoint him a public defender. In the video, Jonchuck says he wants to ""leave it in the hands of God.""

""Okay, so you want to represent yourself,"" asked the judge. Jonchuck repeated, ""I want to leave it in the hands of God.""

One expert said Thursday that Jonchuck meets the criteria for insanity. Psychiatrist Dr. Michael Maher said, ""he told me he remembered dropping Phoebe off the bridge. He remembered feeling that somehow, this would make her safe.""

The defense rested after that testimony.

The prosecution then called their first rebuttal witness, paralegal Kyrstan Malcolm. After a few questions, Judge Chris Helinger sent the jurors home.

Malcolm remained on the stand and continued to be questioned after jurors left. Jonchuck also left the courtroom.

Malcolm works for attorney Genevieve Torres. Jonchuck hired Torres to establish parental rights and discuss custody of Phoebe.

Court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Friday.

DAY 7 RECAP:

Dr. Richard Cipriano, performed another mental health examination on Jonchuck Wednesday morning in jail to check his competency.

Dr. Cipriano was called to the stand in the afternoon and said Jonchuck was competent to proceed with the trial. The judge then ruled Jonchuck competent and ordered the trial to continue.

Jurors then heard testimony from a doctor and a police sergeant.

DAY 6 RECAP:

Jonchuck's attorneys brought up concerns Tuesday about his competency and whether or not he's able to continue standing trial. His defense team said Jonchuck was hearing statements that were not made.

""He also today has been displaying inappropriate laughter, which is a symptom that we have come to recognize sometimes when he does appear to be losing touch,"" his attorney said.

Jonchuck insisted he was fine and not hallucinating but his attorneys said they were concerned.

Once the concerns were brought up, the judge ordered Jonchuck's mental competency be examined by a doctor.

Dr. Jill Poorman, a court psychologist for the circuit, evaluated his competency and ruled that Jonchuck is still competent to stand trial.

After the doctor made her decision, the judge ended court for the day. She says a doctor will come and evaluate Jonchuck Tuesday night and give a report in the morning.

DAY 5 RECAP:

Michele Jonchuck, John's mother, was called back to the stand Friday to testify. During her testimony, she said John was acting different in the days before Phoebe's death.

Michele testified that John called her the ""fallen angel,"" thought Phoebe was possessed and claimed drywall was making her sick.

She also said John was concerned that Phoebe's mother was plotting to take her from him.

After Michele finished her testimony, the defense team called a forensic psychologist to the stand. Dr. Scot Machlus testified that Jonchuck was off certain medications days before the murder and was having delusions.

DAY 4 RECAP:

The defense team called attorney Genevieve Torres to the stand Thursday morning as their first witness. Jonchuck went to Torres to see about establishing paternity for Phoebe.

Torres testified that Jonchuck visited her office on Jan. 6, 2015 to discuss a petition and said he wanted custody of Phoebe. Torres said Jonchuck sounded normal and she saw no red flags. She even said she was impressed with how much information he had to give her. Torres said Jonchuck was very anxious to move forward with the paperwork.

After the initial meeting, Jonchuck said he would return on Jan. 7 to pay Torres.

The attorney said Jonchuck returned the next day dressed in pajamas and hoodie. He had Phoebe with him, as well as a large Swedish Bible.

Torres said the conversation turned strange when Jonchuck started to talk about the bible and asked her to read it to him.

""Then he insisted that I read the bible to him and I said I can't, it was in Swedish, I don't speak Swedish, I can't read his bible, I'm not going to John,"" she said. ""You are the creator, you speak all languages, you know how to speak Swedish and he wasn't joking.""

Torres said Jonchuck got frustrated when she refused him.

""At one point - when he got tired of me saying I was not going to read the bible and I was not God - and he said then I must be God,"" Torres testified.

Torres said she felt uncomfortable and wanted to get Jonchuck out of the office and reminded him of his appointment with Father Bill at St. Paul Catholic Church to discuss baptisms.

She said Jonchuck begin to pack up. That's when she asked him again about the paperwork.

""He got this serious look on his face and he said 'None of this is going to matter tomorrow,'"" said Torres.

She said she became worried and called authorities once he left. Torres said she was in fear that maybe he would flee with Phoebe, but never got the impression he'd harm her.

Police found Jonchuck at the church as he was speaking with Father Bill Swengros.

After Torres' testimony wrapped, the court took a brief recess before hearing from Father Bill. During his testimony, attorneys brought the Swedish Bible back out.

Father Bill said Jonchuck visited him and asked questions about the Bible and baptism. According to the testimony, Jonchuck got upset when Father Bill told him he couldn't baptize him. Jonchuck then told Father Bill he would go somewhere else. Jonchuck never asked about baptism for Phoebe, Father Bill said.

DAY 3 RECAP:

The first witness called to the stand on day three of the trial was Dr. Christopher Wilson, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Phoebe.

After very brief testimony from the medical examiner, the judge asked for a recess and let the jury out of the courtroom so a ""legal issue"" could be taken care of. Once the jury was out of the room, the attorneys and judge discussed which photos of Phoebe can be shown during the trial to the jury.

After hearing arguments from both sides, the judge ruled only one photo of each injury Phoebe sustained will be admissible, as well as one photo of her face.

Dr. Wilson continued his testimony once the jury was back in the room. As autopsy photos of his daughter were shown to the jury, Jonchuck sat with his face in his hands and a tear in his eye.

State prosecutors rested their case against Jonchuck around 11:40 a.m. The judge ordered a brief 15-minute recess before the trial resumes.

The judge wrapped court for the day around 4 p.m. It will resume at 9 a.m. Thursday.

DAY 2 RECAP:

On day two of the trial, the jury first heard testimony from three additional officers who were involved with the investigation into Phoebe's death. During that testimony, jurors saw the large Swedish Bible that officers say Jonchuck had on him the night Phoebe died.

After that testimony concluded, prosecutors started showing video of Jonchuck in the interrogation room after being taken into custody back in 2015. Much of the interrogation room video shown so far features Jonchuck sitting by himself waiting to be questioned.

At one point, Jonchuck starts talking to the authorities in the room about a conspiracy and ""something bigger going on"" that's ""beyond me, beyond everything.""

""It's almost like - I'm not being weird - this is like a conspiracy. I went looking for answers, I've always had problems growing up like wondering who I was and what my purpose was,"" he said.

In the video, Jonchuck also talks about going to a church and speaking with ""Father Bill."" Jonchuck told a detective in the room that the father said he ""wasn't going to be ready this Easter but next Easter""and that, ""I was the pope.""

After almost an hour of being in the interrogation room, Jonchuck asks about his daughter.

""Is Phoebe OK?"" he asks the detective sitting with him.

The detective responds asking who Phoebe is. After a long pause with his head in his hand, Jonchuck responds, ""Phoebe was my daughter.""

Judge Chris Helinger called the prosecutors and defense attorneys to her bench after watching about an hour of the interrogation room video. Judge Helinger decided to call for a lunch break, putting court in recess until 2 p.m.

When court resumed, the jury watched the rest of the interrogation room video before attorneys cross-examined a detective and a former Hillsborough County deputy.

Jonchuck's mother Michele then took the stand and got emotional talking about her granddaughter Phoebe, who she referred to as her ""princess angel.""

Jonchuck's mother was excused after giving testimony about swim lessons for Phoebe and who was caring for the girl.

Prosecutors then called Sgt. Kenny Miller to the stand. Miller was assigned as the lead detective on the case involving Phoebe's death. While on the stand, Sgt. Miller described getting to the scene around 1:20 a.m. Jan. 8, 2015 and seeing crews searching for Phoebe.

Miller testified that the girl's body was found just after 1:30 a.m.

""The boats were coming in and I saw Phoebe come off one of the rescue boats and they were performing CPR on her,"" Miller said. ""She was wet, she had what looked like pajamas on. And she looked very pale.""

Miller said he did not see any signs of life and did not see Phoebe breathing.

DAY 1 RECAP:

On Monday, the jurors heard opening statements from prosecution and defense teams.

The prosecution's opening statement lasted more than an hour. During that time, attorney Paul Bolan walked the jury through the events that took place at the Dick Misener Bridge just after midnight on Jan. 8, 2015.

Bolan also addressed the defense's argument that Jonchuck was insane at the time of his daughter's death.

""The defense will argue that the defendant was insane at the time that he committed this murder. And I want you to keep in mind that the defense has to establish that by clear and convincing evidence,"" he said. ""You've been read a jury instruction for insanity but I'm going to read it to you again because it's important and we need to consider it. And we need to consider carefully what these words say. A person is considered to be insane when he had a mental infirmity, disease or defect. But the analysis does not stop there. Someone is not insane just because they have mental illness, just because there's something wrong with them or they may say things that sound strange.""

The defense team also walked through the events of the night of Phoebe's death, talking about Jonchuck's actions before, during and after his daughter's death. Attorney Jessica Manuele did not deny that Jonchuck dropped his daughter off the bridge, but called it an act of insanity.

""What happened just after midnight (that night) was tragic. That night, John Jonchuck Jr. took his daughter, whom he loved more than anybody in the world and dropped her over the side of the Dick Misener Bridge,"" Manuele said. ""It didn't make sense at the time, it doesn't make sense today. It will never make sense because it is insanity.""

Manuele told jurors that Jonchuck got out of his car on the bridge holding a large Swedish Bible, then got his daughter Phoebe out and dropped her off the bridge. She argued that Jonchuck was calm and did not hurry away, despite a St. Petersburg police officer witnessing what happened.

The defense team also urged jurors to focus heavily on the evidence without letting emotion get in the way.

""Nobody is disputing that what happened that night was tragic. But if you feel that your heartstrings are being intentionally tugged on, pay attention to that,"" she said. ""We have to focus on the evidence.""

After opening statements wrapped up, two witnesses were called to the stand. The first was St. Petersburg Police Officer William Vickers. Vickers is the officer who was on the Dick Misener Bridge when Phoebe was dropped.

In his testimony, Officer Vickers talked about his actions after Phoebe was dropped.

""I was immediately concerned for the child. I advised radio of what had happened. I was shocked but my immediate concern was the health, welfare and safety of the child,"" he said.

Vickers also described hearing a ""faint scream and a splash"" after Phoebe was dropped from the bridge. The officer says he then climbed down a nearby service ladder to try and search for the child.

""It was in the 40s, low 40s. The winds were gusting over 20 miles an hour. At a couple points, I was nearly blown off the bumper walkway area at the bottom of the bridge,"" he said, adding that the water was rough, dark and cold.

""I continued to call until a fire rescue boat arrived in the area. At that point, I got on to assist in searching and coordinating between police and fire resources,"" Vickers said. ""I looked at my watch a couple of times thinking 'we gotta find her, we gotta find her.'""

The second witness called to the stand was a toll collector who gave a brief testimony about what he saw the night Phoebe died.

After the first two witnesses finished testifying, the judge ended court for the day and instructed jurors not to listen to, watch or talk about anything related to the trial.

Jonchuck is accused of dropping his 5-year-old daughter Phoebe off the Dick Misener Bridge in January 2015. His murder trial was delayed several years but began in March after a jury of 12 was seated.

Jonchuck was being treated at a mental health facility up until recently. The judge warned the jury that he is medicated and they must not let his present condition in court or side effects from the medications affect their decision-making process.

State prosecutors say they will not seek the death penalty in this case. If found guilty, Jonchuck could serve life in prison. If the jury finds him innocent, he'll stay in a mental institution.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/jury-deliberations-continue-today-in-the-john-jonchuck-trial/1929369878,2019-04-16T07:39:43Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

1306,Come Together Against Cancer sets $1 million goal,"Second annual fundraiser unites donors with pioneering specialists, institutions, and their research

SARASOTA — Saturday was a chance like few others. Medical researchers presenting their recent prostate, breast and brain cancer findings directly to the people funding their projects beneath a cyan-colored sky.

The researchers, from as far away as the Medical College of Wisconsin, spoke of groundbreaking findings and promising new hypotheses.

Michael Gorin, the director of urology clinical trials at Johns Hopkins Brady Urological Institute, spoke of initial success in the improvement of imaging technology to better diagnose and treat prostate cance, which the Cancer Society says impacts one in nine men.

Kenneth Meredith, medical director of the Gastrointestinal Surgical Oncology Cancer Institute at Sarasota Memorial Health Systems, spoke of the struggles in treating pancreatic cancer. His team of researchers is working on a chemotherapy that would untangle tumors from blood vessels, making the cancer easier to treat.

The researchers gathered at Eloise Werlin Park — named for a woman who lost her fight against breast cancer in 2011 — along with hundreds of donors for Coming Together Against Cancer, a Sarasota nonprofit that raises funds for cancer programs nationwide. Last year’s inaugural event raised $750,000.

This year the nonprofit aims to raise $1 million — it was halfway there Saturday morning.

Tom Koski, 58, a retired software executive, donated $50,000 last year to Moffitt Cancer Center, hoping to see better diagnosis options for prostate cancer, which claimed the lives of his father and father-in-law. They were misdiagnosed, he said.

Koski’s wife, Sherry, was recently diagnosed with breast cancer — changing his focus and passion. This year the couple donated $25,000.

For Koski, the annual fundraiser is an opportunity to find out directly where his money is going and to meet the researchers toiling in the trenches. Susan J. Hoover, one of the researchers vying for funding on Saturday, was also Sherry’s surgical oncologist.

“Knowing the people and where your money is going is crucial,” said Koski, who now works as a volunteer fundraiser for other nonprofits. “This event is good because if someone new is coming, they’re going to tell two people, who are going to tell three people. It’s a ripple effect.”

The Coming Together Against Cancer fundraising event was founded by local cancer survivor and philanthropist Ernest “Doc” Werlin. The nonprofit directs contributions toward some 35 research and support organizations. Local recipients have been Breast Health Sarasota, Florida Cancer Specialists Foundation, JFCS of the Suncoast and Team Tony Cancer Foundation.

Werlin survived chronic myelogenous leukemia and colon cancer. His brother, brother-in-law, mother-in-law and wife, Eloise, died of cancer.

“This is something that has devastated my family and so many others,” Werlin said. “This is what I want to devote the rest of my life to fighting against.”

After Werlin spoke, he looked around at the park named for his wife, out at the crowd of donors, researchers, physicians, caterers and the joggers cutting past the wine bar. Nearby, a few children climbed on the playground, which has also been the backdrop for other fundraisers, including Children’s First Foundation.

Werlin sighed, and said softly, “This park is not just a place to play anymore.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190413/come-together-against-cancer-sets-1-million-goal?rssfeed=true,2019-04-13T16:28:04Z,Sarasota Herald,Couple,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

The patriarch of a family who ran a café on Fifth Avenue South for more than a decade died of cancer Friday morning at home in Naples.

Joaquin Carlos Iribarren, 64, operated Bella Maria Cafe from 2004 to 2016 with his wife, Maria, and son Francisco. The local tapas restaurant blended Chef Iribarren’s Spanish dishes such as seafood paella with his wife’s Chilean cuisine and desserts.

Iribarren was born Dec. 21, 1954, in the Basque Country of Spain. After attending culinary school he lived in Chile, where he met and married Maria Elena Plaza.

""It was just a natural thing to become a chef being in a restaurant all the time. I used to watch my grandfather and father and it was part of me,” Iribarren said in 2005. “My family comes from the Basque region of Spain. I have had restaurants in Baltimore and Fort Myers.""

The couple operated the highly rated Bella Maria restaurant in Fort Myers before relocating it south to Naples in 2004.

""We thought it was time to come to Naples and introduce everyone to traditional tapas and Spanish dishes,” he said.

Maria and Joaquin, who many knew as Carlos, launched their cozy Bella Maria Cafe in a little restaurant space in downtown Naples that previously had been Spice of Life, Old Circus Grill and Capt. Seaweed's Fish Joint. The longtime restaurant had to close when that section of Fifth Avenue South was razed for redevelopment in 2016.

""The restaurant business is tough,"" Carlos Iribarren said. ""We have to work seven days and there is a lot of preparation before we open for business every day.""

If he wasn’t a chef he said he could have been a handyman because he loved to work with his hands.

""I love to fix things and always help my neighbors,"" he said.

Cooking was his passion, though, because it gave him great satisfaction. At home, he often prepared fish, seafood stews, filet mignon and fresh vegetables for guests.

""I love to cook, especially seafood and any kind of fish,"" he said. ""I also create things at home to try out before making it in the restaurant.""

His son Francisco, known as Franco the sangria expert and server at Bella Maria, was inspired by his father, he said Friday.

“He used to make a lot of people happy,” he said.

In addition to his wife and sons, Francisco and Carlos, Iribarren leaves behind many friends in the area. The surviving Iribarrens still plan to eventually reopen another version of their family fusion restaurant in the Naples area and they continue to sell their empanadas, quiche and tarts at the weekly Third Street South Farmer’s Market in downtown Naples.

“We just want to keep the Bella Maria experience going,” Franco said. “We have a history in Naples.”

A private service will be held. Friends may sign the guest register and leave a condolence message on the website of the Baldwin Brothers Funeral and Cremation Society, BaldwinCremation.com.

1309,Salt water intrusion can harm landscapes,"Hurricanes can create some confounding and unusual circumstances for homeowners and landscape professionals.

After Hurricane Ivan in 2004, I worked with a homeowner’s association in Niceville where saltwater from the bay had flooded their community’s large irrigation pond. The irrigation system was shared for home landscapes and a prized golf course.

Residents had been through a similar situation during Hurricane Opal. They understood continued use of contaminated irrigation water could cause additional damage to turfgrass, ornamental beds and trees. The pond was drained and re-filled with clean water.

It doesn’t take a hurricane for salt to become a landscape issue. Salt can also become an issue over an extended time period. Salt accumulation, even in small amounts, from irrigation water can cause soil problems for sensitive plants. Common salt problems arise from conditions such as saltwater intrusion into wells, the use of reclaimed water, and saltspray conditions near bays and the Gulf.

Saltwater Intrusion

Many of us are familiar with the term and concept of saltwater intrusion. Intrusion occurs as freshwater resources are consumed and saltwater enters the well aquifer sources. Saltwater can enter well water from the side (horizontal) or from the bottom (vertical). Wells can function for decades without issue.

Periods of drought or an increase in the number of wells accessing limited water resources can create increased incidents of saltwater intrusion. Like other salty soil problems, homeowners or property managers typically see plants that are underperforming, looking wilted, stunted or discolored. Learn more about saltwater intrusion at http://bit.ly/saltintrusion

Reclaimed Water

Increasingly, Florida municipalities are providing reclaimed water at low cost to residents helping meet the need of our state’s growing population. Reclaimed water is produced after multiple stages of treatment to address pathogens and suspended solids. Other than drinking or use on raw vegetables, it is clean water good for a variety uses both at home and for commercial applications such as golf courses or in manufacturing. Learn more at http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ss544

Although reclaimed water is cleaned appropriately for alternate use, it may have higher salt content than domestic water or other surface water irrigation sources. This salt can remain in the soil after roots have taken in water. Symptoms of these issues can range from salt crust at the surface in extreme circumstances to plants look dry or wilted even after watering. This is explained in further detail at http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ss545

Salt Spray

Another common coastal issue is salt spray. Marine water can be carried in the wind to inland areas during periods of high surf conditions, impacting shoreline plants. Plants exposed to salt spray will appear excessively dry with yellow or brown leaves. Salt tolerant plants will recover quicker from these temporary conditions compared to sensitive species. Coastal landscapes near the bay or Gulf should be constructed and designed with salt spray and salt tolerance in mind.

Tools You Can Use:

Our Extension office has several tools to help diagnose and combat salty soil problems. Soil and irrigation water testing are two good places to start. The UF/IFAS soil testing lab uses a couple of tests including Electrical Conductivity (EC) to identify salt problems in soil and water. EC test results paired with analysis of Sodium and Chloride can help homeowners pinpoint problems and find solutions. Learn more about water testing at https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ss440

If salty conditions are identified or suspected, homeowners can temporarily use domestic water to do a targeted rinse with known sources of freshwater such as water supplied by a municipality or utility company. Should plants need to be replaced or you are renovating your coastal landscape, our “Florida Yards and Neighborhoods” website and printed resources can help make decisions in plant selection based on environmental conditions including salt tolerance. These resources help homeowners facing issues from salt spray, saltwater intrusion, and reclaimed water. The plant selection tool and other helpful information for landscape design to create a “Florida Friendly Yard” can be accessed at http://floridayards.org

SOLEDAD: IS MAN INHERENTLY GOOD? OR EVIL? IT’S A QUESTION PHILOSOPHERS-AND COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR CENTURIES. TODAY, WITH HYPER PARTISANSHIP, SOCIAL MEDIA FUELED RANTS, AND DEPRESSING NEWS HEADLINES, YOU MIGHT BE CONVINCED THE ANSWER IS, UM, NO. BUT A NEW BOOK CALLED, ""BLUEPRINT: THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF A GOOD SOCIETY"" IS A SCIENTIFIC DEFENSE OF OUR HUMANITY. IT’S WRITTEN BY NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS, HE’S PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL AND NATURAL SCIENCE AT YALE UNIVERSITY. IT IS NICE TO HAVE YOU. MR. CHRISTAKIS: THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. SOLEDAD: MY PLEASURE. SO YOU COME AT THIS FROM A SOCIAL SCIENCES PERSPECTIVE THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF VIRTUE. WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE THAT MAN IS INHERENTLY GOOD? MR. CHRISTAKIS: SO EVEN THOUGH WE ARE GIVEN TO HATRED AND TRIBALISM AND VIOLENCE OF ALL KINDS EQUALLY WE ARE PRONE TO LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION AND TEACHING AND THESE GOOD THINGS MUST HAVE OUTWEIGHED THE BAD THINGS. OTHERWISE WE WOULDN’T LIVE SOCIALLY AT ALL. THE BOOK IS AN ARGUMENT ABOUT HOW THESE THINGS WE DO ARE A PART OF OUR NATURE AND THEY MUST HAVE OUTWEIGHED THE BAD THINGS. SOLEDAD: YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES IN THE BOOK. ONE IS THE 1954 ROBBER’S CAVE EXPERIMENT. WALK ME THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED. MR. CHRISTAKIS: SO THIS IS A VERY FAMOUS SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY DEMONSTRATION THAT WAS DONE BY MUZAFFAR SHARIF. HE TOOK A GROUP OF ABOUT 20 11 YEAR OLDS. HE AND HE SET UP THIS KIND OF TRUMAN SHOW SITUATION WHERE THE SCIENTISTS WERE WATCHING THESE KIDS INTERACT. SOLEDAD: BUT THEY DON’T REALIZE IT. THEY’RE THE EXPERIMENT. THEY DON’T REALIZE THEY ARE THE EXPERIMENT. MR. CHRISTAKIS: THEY DON’T UNDERSTAND AT ALL. THEY WERE FIRST DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. THE FIRST WEEK THEY ALLOWED THE GROUPS TO DEVELOP A GROUP IDENTITY. THE DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER FROM BEFORE. THEY PUT THEM INTO COMPETITION BECAUSE THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO SEE HOW EASILY COULD THEY CULTIVATE A KIND OF HATRED OF THE OTHER GROUP. SOLEDAD: AND IT WAS EASY. MR. CHRISTAKIS: VERY EASY. THEY PLUGGED UP THE WATER SUPPLY TO THE CAMP. AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN THE TAPS WEREN’T WORKING. AND THEN THE CAMP COUNSELORS ORGANIZED THE BOYS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. AND IN THAT WEEK OF TIME WHEN THE TWO GROUPS WERE OBLIGED TO FACE A COMMON ENEMY. THEY WERE ABLE TO NOW THINK WELL OF EACH OTHER. SO THEY WERE ABLE TO EFFACE THE SCIENTIST WERE ABLE TO UNDO THE TRIBALISM BY GIVING THE GROUP A BIGGER PROBLEM. SOLEDAD: IS TRIBALISM INHERENTLY BAD. MR. CHRISTAKIS: NO IT’S NOT INHERENTLY BAD. THIS IS THE THING. THE REASON WE EVOLVED TO HAVE AN US VERSUS THEM KIND OF TRIBALISM IS THAT IT ALSO IS IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO COOPERATE. IN OTHER WORDS IF I GAVE YOU THE CHALLENGE OF COOPERATING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE IT’S EASIER FOR OUR SPECIES TO LEARN AND BE ABLE TO COOPERATE IF WE REDUCE THE SENSE OF SCALE. FRIENDSHIP EVOLVED IN PART AS A AS A REASON AS A SAME TOOL TO REDUCE THE SENSE OF SCALE. SO NOW AGAIN YOU DON’T SAY COOPERATE WITH EVERYONE YOU SAY COOPERATE WITH YOUR FRIENDS. SOLEDAD: YOU DEDICATE THE BOOK TO YOUR WIFE ERIKA AND THE TWO OF YOU WERE CAUGHT IN THIS HUG ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE KIND OF EXPERIENCE AT YALE OVER HALLOWEEN COSTUMES. GOOGLE IT. I JUST CAN’T GET INTO THOSE HORROR STORY IF ANYBODY WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT IT BUT I’M CURIOUS AS THAT AS THAT WAS GOING ON AND I DISAGREED WITH YOUR POSITION ON THIS. BUT DID YOU START YOU’RE WRITING THE BOOK WHILE LITERALLY A MOB IS CALLING FOR YOUR HEAD. AND I DON’T THINK THAT’S OVERSTATING IT. DID THAT AFFECT HOW YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE WRITING. >> NO I WOULD SAY I’M AN OPTIMIST. I BELIEVE IN THE GOODNESS OF HUMAN BEINGS AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF OUR NATURE THAT ARE BAD. I ALSO RECOGNIZE THERE ARE PARTS OF OUR NATURE THAT ARE GOOD WHEN THEY’RE OVER EXPRESSED CAN BE BAD. SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE DESIRE TO FORM A GROUP AND TO SURRENDER YOUR INDIVIDUALITY TO BE A PART OF A GROUP CAN BE A WONDERFUL THING. SOLEDAD: AND SOMETIMES IT BECOMES A MOB. MR. CHRISTAKIS: SO WHEN I WAS SEEING THAT BEHAVIOR THAT YOU ALLUDE TO UP CLOSE I WAS WELL AWARE OF WHAT I WAS WITNESSING. I WAS WELL AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON. IT DIDN’T IT DIDN’T DISSUADE ME FROM MY CONFIDENCE IN OUR GOODNESS. SOLEDAD: I LOVE AN OPTIMIST. THE BOOK IS CALLED BLUEPRINT THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF A GOOD SOCIETY.

1311,"'Pete the Cat' author Eric Litwin thrills students, kicks off a 'Groovy Joe' dance party","CLOSE Eric LItwin, author of the original 'Pete the Cat,' talks about how came up with the idea to combine music and literacy. Alicia Devine, Tallahassee Democrat

The moment children's author Eric Litwin grabbed his guitar and took to the stage at DeSoto Trail Elementary School Friday afternoon, the room erupted with cheers and applause from the students and teachers.

Litwin, author of the insanely popular ""Pete the Cat"" books, is in town for an appearance at the Word of South festival Saturday. His performances combine readings and songs to create a fun and interactive experience for the kids.

Students in Pre-K through fifth grade gathered on the cafeteria floor, seated ""criss-cross applesauce,"" eagerly awaiting the start of the performance. They were thrilled to see the writer of some of their favorite books in person.

Before Litwin sang ""Groovy Joe: Dance Party Countdown"" — a piece that stars a disco-ball-loving, guitar-strumming dog — he demonstrated the dance moves that go with the song. It didn't take long for the audience to join in.

Groovy Joe's dance party starts out with a couple of friends, but as the party continues, other friends knock on the door. Groovy Joe always invites them in.

Litwin said the story of Groovy Joe and his dance party teaches children that ""there is always room for one more.""

The author loves to interact with the children as he performs. He dances with them, sings with them, and invites some on stage to help him create a song.

When he asked the crowd of children for a volunteer, about a hundred little hands waved in the air.

Riley Bergozza, 6, was lucky enough to be the first student called up to the stage.

She walked up the steps and stood behind a microphone set at just the right height for her. Next to her, Litwin sat on a stool and played his guitar.

He asked her what she loved. Her face lit up as she leaned into the microphone and said ""everything.""

He turned her answer into a song: ""I love everything, because I'm groovy."" The kids tried their best to sing along with him. When he continued with the next verse — ""I love everything, that changes when you get older"" — the teachers burst out laughing.

Riley bounced off the stage excited and starstruck. She whispered to her teacher, ""I'm sweating.""

Before singing the ""So Long Song,"" Litwin invited the teachers to dance along with the students for a disco groove.

""There's a place for technology but a good old fashioned printed book allows students to have a vivid imagination and share the fun with their families,"" said Michele Keltner, principal at DeSoto Trail.

Litwin is performing at Word of South at 11:30 a.m. Saturday at the Lyric Stage.

1312,Will state Health Department be more transparent on Hep A outbreak?,"Blood sample for hepatitis A virus (HAV) test (Photo: jarun011, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

The cavalry has arrived.

Or so some Very Important People would have us believe.

Friday morning a bevy of state and local bigwigs gathered at the Martin County Sheriff's Office to say: We've got this Hepatitis A thing under control.

Trust us.

But when one after another of the elected and appointed officials stepped up to say the exact same thing about the need to wash your hands, I thought: This is a joke, right?

Luckily, the remainder of the event, called by state Sen. Gayle Harrell, did shake a few answers loose from the tree of obfuscation.

There is, in fact, a ""cluster"" of Hepatitis A infections in Palm City, at least five.

Of the 19 cases confirmed as of this writing, five are homeless.

Officials have no indication any restaurant or food store was the source of the virus; indeed, there could be more than one source, as Martin isn't the only Florida county experiencing an outbreak.

The Florida Department of Health in St. Lucie County will now be running the show here in Martin County when it comes to the Hep A response. Turns out the local health agency lost its director to retirement a few months ago, and the acting director's been out of the country on her honeymoon.

And while the 19 local cases really aren't that many, what's unusual is that there have been three deaths. Hepatitis A almost never kills people.

Those who die from Hep A often suffer from some other, underlying medical condition, said State Epidemiologist Carina Blackmore.

But this is Martin County. We're old. And old people — like me! — usually have underlying medical issues.

So 19 may be a small number — but this is indeed a big deal.

In the end, though, the message was that public officials are taking this all very seriously, so there's no reason to worry, just wash your hands and get vaccinated if you aren't already, and everything will be just fine.

Maybe; we hope.

But I got the sense that despite appearances, state and local folks aren't working real closely.

For here's something else we learned: the Martin County Sheriff's Office has offered to help the state health department investigate the outbreak. Deputies could try to trace credit card records or identify restaurants where the infected ate, that sort of thing.

The health department hasn't accepted that request.

Buy Photo Gil Smart (Photo: JEREMIAH WILSON/TCPALM)

Moreover, both Sheriff William Snyder and Ed Ciampi, chairman of the Martin County Commission, took veiled shots at the health department for its refusal to release information on where the Hep A infections have occurred.

Snyder said that's because state officials don't want to cause a panic.

But ""lack of knowledge and ignorance is much more likely a firestarter for panic than information,"" Snyder said.

Indirectly addressing the health department, he said: ""Tell us what's going on, show us what you're doing, tell us where these are occurring, tell us what you're working on and let us deal with it.""

Amen.

But don't hold your breath.

So look, at this point I'm sure the health department is taking this seriously; the worsening outbreak, questions from the public and elected officials and pressure from the media is pushing them hard.

That's good; this is their job.

But will it be good enough?

On Thursday, I talked with Martin Gucciardo, of Palm City, who along with his wife contracted the Hep A virus. He's recovered; she's still sick. They live down the street from Jeff and Nancy Kirsch, the couple that died of the virus, but never met them.

Gucciardo was hospitalized; while there he got a call from the health department, asking him questions about his condition and where he might have caught the virus. But, he said, it wasn't until a few days ago health officials called his wife, even though he'd told them that she, too, was sick.

And he's reached out to health officials, offering to share receipts and other proof of where he and his wife have eaten so officials can pin down a source.

No response.

""They don't know what's going on,"" he said. ""It's really sad.""

The health department has declined to comment on specific cases, citing HIPAA laws.

Going forward, will things be different? Will transparency, as articulated by Snyder — tell us where these cases are; tell us what leads you have — win out? Or will health officials continue to do what Richard Nixon once termed the ""limited hang-out"" route?

I'd like to think Friday's event signaled a new approach. We'd all like to think that the cavalry has, in fact, arrived.

But the cavalry's got to deliver more than horse manure to make a difference.

MARTIN COUNTY— State and local health officials are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention trying to pin down where hepatitis A is spreading from in Martin County.

As of Friday morning, all three agencies don’t have any specific leads and are not investigating specific restaurants in the county.

There have been 19 cases of the virus in Martin County, with three confirmed deaths resulting from complications of the virus.

At a press conference Friday morning, Lt. Gov. Jeanette Núñez; State Rep. Brian Mast; State Sen. Gayle Harrell; Dr. Carina Blackmore, state epidemiologist and director for the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection at the Florida Department of Health; and other local health and law enforcement officials spoke about the county and state’s plan on how to protect the public from hepatitis A.

Officials are urging residents with any questions or tips about the outbreak to call the state’s toll free hotline number at 844-225-5364.

“To Martin County residents, I want to assure you that we’re committed and diligently working to investigate the cause of these local hepatitis A infections and we will leave no stone unturned,” Núñez said. “I am having daily meetings with the Department of Health to measure our progress in this investigation and as we continue to investigate, we will work closely with other states, as well as the CDC.”

Martin County was considered a ""high risk"" area when five cases of the virus were confirmed on April 1. This came days after a couple in Palm City died the end of March, with the cause of death ""complications from hepatitis A,"" according to the Treasure Coast Medical Examiner's office.

A third person, Lee Collins, was confirmed to have died from complications of the virus on March 31, Martin County Commissioner Edward Campi said.

Núñez said the outbreak in Martin County is part of a statewide outbreak where over 1,200 cases on the virus have been reported in Florida since the beginning of the year. She said other counties in the state, such as Pinellas county, where Tampa is located, have already experienced over 100 cases of the virus since the start of 2019.

State Epidemiologist Carina Blackmore said it is unusual for three people to die in one county in less than a month from the virus because it usually only causes stomach flu-like symptoms for most people such as nausea, stomach pain and jaundice, yellowing of the eyes and skin.

What to know about hepatitis A. (Photo: FLORIDA HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF MARTIN COUNTY)

The virus is spread by food or water contaminated by the fecal matter of someone infected with hepatitis A. Blackmore said signs of the virus usually start around two to six weeks after a person is exposed to the virus.

Toby Overdorf, a Florida legislature of District 83, said people in the food business should communicate with their employees to be proactive and wash their hands.

“To our restaurateurs and to our business owners, have a talk with your staff,” he said. “Have a talk with your people that are associated with this, educate them on the clean health that they should be having in association with this.”

Blackmore said finding the sources where infected people made contact with the virus is a "" very meticulous process.""

""We want to go back and look at cases and work with family members of those that are deceased unfortunately to verify what activities they had, where they ate a month ago or six weeks ago,"" she said. ""When we get a picture of that, we will start to understand what actually happened in Martin County.""

Blackmore said the next step for the Florida Department of Health's investigation, which is in the initial stages, is to do more laboratory testing with the three people that have died from complications of the disease. She said the agency has also started contacting family members of people infected and getting documentation such as receipts to paint a picture of what an infected person was doing around the time they probably came into contact with the virus.

In the next few weeks, Blackmore said the state hopes to get more information on the sources of the virus.

» Blackmore said they’re in the initial stages of trying to find out how the virus has spread through Martin County.

» Blackmore said with hepatitis A, the virus is spread through people, so it’s hard to track down the movement of the people infected. She said the state has seen a cluster of infected people in Palm City.

» Blackmore: Although the number of cases is small in Martin County, there is “the unusual nature of three deaths.”

» Blackmore: The health department has the virus from individuals and the Centers for Disease Control is studying it.

» Blackmore: Bigger counties including Hillsborough, Orange, Pasco have more than 100 cases; Pinellas has more than 200 cases.

1316,Bruno Total Home faces string of lawsuits from homeowners,"CLOSE Cape Coral police including a forensic unit and the Lee County Sheriff’s Office are on scene Tuesday, Jan. 15, 2019, at Bruno Total Home Performance in Bonita Springs. They have been inspecting vehicles and taking documents out of the offices. Laura Layden, laura.layden@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4818

Louis Bruno isn't just facing a state probe into his air conditioning business.

Since law enforcement raided Bruno Total Home Performance's offices in Bonita Springs earlier this year, several homeowners have sued the company and its affiliates for fraud and deceptive practices in state court in Lee and Collier counties.

In the lawsuits, Bruno is named personally as a defendant.

""None of these people have paid any of their bills, but they have received new equipment and are enjoying the use of them,"" said Bruno's attorney Robert Burandt, who is based in Cape Coral.

The lawsuits are yet another blow for Bruno as he works to turn around his troubled air conditioning, electrical and plumbing business.

Bruno has lost much of his workforce and he's handling more jobs himself because of the bad publicity generated by the state's investigation, Burandt said. Law enforcement officers seized computers, phones and files, making it difficult to keep operating the business.

A trio of lawsuits

Fort Myers attorney Robert Goodman is handling a trio of lawsuits for homeowners who have sued Bruno and his business since the raid. The circumstances are different in each lawsuit, but there's one common claim: The customers allege their signatures were forged on documents required to purchase and finance a new A/C system from Bruno Total Home.

The civil lawsuits are an attempt to resolve the homeowners' issues as quickly as possible in a way that doesn't cost them too much money, Goodman said.

""We're trying to right the wrong without causing them additional heartburn,"" he said.

Goodman expects to file more lawsuits in the coming weeks.

His clients include Sandra Diaz, a Cape Coral resident with multiple sclerosis who is bedridden. In her lawsuit, she said Bruno ""exploited"" a ""vulnerable adult.""

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

Diaz claims she can't write her own name because her disabilities are so severe. Although her full name appeared on a notice of commencement for a new A/C system, she alleges the document was fraudulently signed and notarized.

Also, Diaz contends she was deceived about financing for the project. A representative for Bruno Total Home, she claims, signed her up for PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) financing through Ygrene Energy Fund without her approval and she's not able to get out of the loan.

The PACE program allows property owners to finance eligible energy efficiency and storm hardening home improvements and then pay the costs back over time through a voluntary assessment on their tax bill. Ygrene is one of a handful of companies offering PACE loans in Florida.

Diaz claims a representative for Bruno Total Home told her she'd pay nothing extra for PACE financing, only the amount on her final bill from the contractor, which came to $14,950.

Ygrene charges an average interest rate of about 7.1 percent for the financing. With the financing, Diaz will pay more than $35,000 over 20 years for the new A/C — or a little over $1,773 a year, according to county land records.

""She doesn't need any extra stress in her life,"" Goodman said. ""And this has definitely created that.""

No contract?

Goodman also represents Lance Henderson and wife Patricia from Cape Coral, who claim technicians for Bruno Total Home removed their old air conditioning system and started replacing it without a signed contract, or their permission.

""He didn't sign the contract,"" Goodman said. ""He didn't agree to the work. He actually tried to stop the work repeatedly.""

The Hendersons also allege Bruno tried to sign them up for a PACE loan without their approval. Unlike Diaz, the couple said they got out of the financing agreement after explaining to Ygrene's representatives that their signatures had been forged on the documents.

Additionally, the Hendersons claim Bruno arranged a second loan through a company called GreenSky, without their approval, but they couldn't get out of that agreement and are making those payments.

When Lance Henderson contacted GreenSky, he said a company representative there told him to report his issues with the loan to Cape Coral police, so he did.

GreenSky, a financial technology company based in Atlanta, arranges loans for home improvement projects. The company has no affiliation with Ygrene and isn't a PACE provider.

Henderson said he didn't receive a contract from Bruno Total Home until after the work started at his home. The contract showed he and his wife owed $19,795 for labor and materials to the contractor and $18,950 to GreenSky for duct work — much more than they would have been comfortable paying.

A spokesman for GreenSky has said the company has since cuts ties to Bruno Total Home.

In an interview with the Naples Daily News a few months ago, Henderson said he likely spurred the search and seizure by local law enforcement officers at Bruno Total Home's headquarters on Jan. 15.

In November, Henderson filed a report labeled as ""information fraud"" with the Cape Coral Police Department.

Investigations ongoing

Both the Cape Coral Police Department and the state Attorney General's Office have confirmed they're investigating Bruno Total Home, but they won't say why because civil and criminal investigations are still active.

The Attorney General's Office has now received 190 consumer complaints about the company.

""As our cases are active and ongoing, we cannot comment further at this time,"" said Press Secretary Kylie Mason.

In serving an investigative subpoena on the business, the Attorney General's Office cited the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.

In Bruno's defense, Burandt said Lance Henderson went to the contractor's offices and demanded a price break on the cost of installation, when Bruno had already given him ""a $3,000 reduction by not charging him to move the unit to a new location.""

""He told Louis that if he didn’t get a reduction he would go to the police because he had friends in the Cape Coral Police Department,"" Burandt said.

A third case filed against Bruno and his company involves Deborah Giardello, an East Naples resident who claims she was misled about the cost of getting a new air conditioner with a maintenance agreement — and about how she'd pay for it.

Giardello said she electronically signed a document on a cell phone that she thought would allow Bruno Total Home to see whether she qualified for the PACE program. A day later, she said she received an email from Ygrene congratulating her on wanting to get financing through the company, although she hadn't signed any paperwork for it.

Price shock

In her lawsuit, Giardello claims she was shocked to learn that Bruno attempted to collect $22,700, plus $1,186 in closing costs from Ygrene — and that Ygrene was going to charge her more than $29,770 in interest over 20 years, bringing her total costs to more than $53,600.

Thankfully, she said, Ygrene allowed her to cancel the loan after its representatives explained the financing in more detail on a phone call to confirm the terms.

In a recent statement, Ygrene said it ended its relationship with Bruno Total Home last year because it did not maintain ""Ygrene's high standard for PACE approved contractors."" Ygrene has helped finance improvements on more than 350 properties in Collier County and more than 97 percent of homeowners who work with Ygrene on PACE projects are satisfied and report no complaints, according to an independent audit.

Giardello claims she never signed a contract to allow Bruno to install a new air conditioning system either.

After she refused to pay the company — Bruno Total Home filed a foreclosure action against her.

Bruno has since dropped the foreclosure action, but still seeks a court judgment to collect on the construction lien his company placed on Giardello's property for the money it's owed.

Due to negative publicity, Bruno decided to drop all of the foreclosure actions he took against homeowners in Lee and Collier counties for nonpayment, Burandt said. Bruno still has liens on the properties and still seeks court judgments against their owners, which would give him other legal remedies to seize the money.

More lawsuits

Bruno faces other legal challenges, including lawsuits filed by his business partners who allege he violated the terms of their operating agreement, by vendors who claim their owed money and by other homeowners who are unhappy with his work.

In case you missed it: Investors file lawsuit against Louis Bruno, allege he took money from company

In one lawsuit filed in 2017, Naples homeowners Winfried and Christina Horstenkamp and their limited liability company allege Bruno Air performed ""significant, substantial and defective work"" when it installed a new A/C unit at a condominium they owned off Gulfshore Boulevard in 2014.

The Horstenkamps' claims include violations of the Florida Building Code, negligence, breach of contract and misrepresentation.

The couple contends the defective air conditioning system caused mold growth and other problems at their condo. They seek damages for the cost of purchasing a replacement A/C system, lost rental income and other expenses they say resulted from Bruno's work.

""This is an older building with an open air lobby. That means the units are subject to a lot of humidity,"" Burandt said.

Bruno Air, he said, installed the Horstenkamps' A/C unit, but didn't select it. Trane chose the system and it worked fine after installation, Burandt said.

Later the couple's repairman concluded the unit failed, so it would be the manufacturer's responsibility to fix it, not Bruno's, Burandt argued.

""They've claimed damages for breach of contract when the LLC hadn’t even been formed until after the contract was signed. They have claimed damages for lost rentals when they didn’t have a history of renting the unit. They claimed damages for furniture, which they got as part of the sale. It looks like they wanted to remodel and used this as a catalyst to do so,"" Burandt said.

A jury trial is scheduled for May 20.

1317,"Harmless drift algae piling up on Fort Myers Beach, Bunche Beach, none in Collier","CLOSE Here's the difference between red tide and blue-green algae Wochit

Red drift algae is blanketing some beaches and sparing others as it creeps along the Southwest Florida coast.

This algae, however, should not be confused with red tide or blue-green algae.

A non-toxic variety that actually creates wildlife habitat once its on beaches, red drift algae is really seaweed that broke loose from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico and washed ashore.

""The odor would be the only thing,"" said Rick Bartleson, a water quality scientist with the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation. ""Some types have really fine branches and they’re really soft, so if it’s a huge quantity of the fine branches it can rot instead of dry out and that causes some big stinks.""

Red drift algae accumulates at Bowdtich Point on the north end of Fort Myers Beach on Monday April, 8, 2019. The non toxic smelly algae is showing up in patches throughout Southwest Florida. Some water quality scientists say that the algae is fed by higher nurient levels from runoff and other issues. (Photo: Andrew West, The News-Press USA Today Network-Florida)

The smell on Fort Myers Beach was noticeable Thursday.

Beachgoers stumbled around and over clumps of algae that littered parts of the beach.

The piles roll up on beaches and collect shells, sticks, coconut husks, lost sunglasses and Miller Lite caps.

""I found some sponges and broken sand dollars,"" said Olivia Parmley. ""But I'm from Colorado, so this does not bother me at all. I like beaches that are natural and not all manicured. This is how it's supposed to be.""

Work crews Thursday were busy cleaning up lines of seaweed on parts of Fort Myers Beach, hauling away truckloads of the stringy sea debris.

Mike Parsons, a marine sciences professor at Florida Gulf Coast University, said detaching from the bottom or other hard surfaces can simply be a life stage for drift algae.

""We (can get) green seaweed, brown seaweed, red seaweed,"" Parsons said. ""Usually it's part of the natural process. Some will keep growing as they drift around and others will die.""

Parsons said Fort Myers Beach tends to be at the center of red drift algae outbreaks because of ocean currents, not bad water.

""It really has nothing to do with Fort Myers Beach or water quality there,"" Parsons said. ""It's just how the current flows. But this is the most we've seen in a couple of years.""

This area seems to have been hit the hardest as drift algae could be seen from Bowditch Point Park at the north tip of the island south to San Carlos Pass, where the island ends.

But less drift algae could be found on Bonita Beach, and it seems Naples has avoided the algae altogether.

""Thank God we’re not getting it on Naples beaches,"" said Roger Jacobsen, harbor master for the City of Naples. ""I’ve seen nothing. Zero. I was hoping that the cold spell that came down with the rain would help keep it offshore, and maybe that’s what happened.""

Bartleson said the drift algae broke lose from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico after a recent cold front came through the region.

The outbreak comes in the wake of a red tide/blue-green algae bloom combo last year that rocked Lee County especially hard.

Red tide and dying fish and marine organisms caused low oxygen levels at the bottom of the Gulf.

The low oxygen levels killed drift algae grazers like sea snails, sea cucumbers and other organisms,"" Bartleson said.

With fewer critters nibbling on the seaweed, it was able to grow almost uninhibited.

This happens rather frequently in Southwest Florida and is nothing to be alarmed about, he said.

""It doesn’t have to be red tide that causes this,"" Bartleson said. ""It just happens to be it this time. You just have to have an algae bloom that takes up all the oxygen from the lower layer (of the Gulf).""

1318,Winter Park police apologize for accusing wrong man in stolen MagicBand case,"WINTER PARK, Fla. - Winter Park police are apologizing after tweeting a video that showed a man wearing a Disney MagicBand they wrongly said he had stolen during a burglary.

The original tweet, which has since been deleted, asked people to identify the man shown firing a toy gun while wearing the yellow MagicBand on what appeared to be the Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin ride at Magic Kingdom.

""Hey friends and #DisTwitter, we need your help identifying this man. A residential burglary occurred and the suspect was captured using a magic band that was stolen during that time. These guys are definitely not Galactic Heroes,"" the initial tweet said.

MagicBands are all-in-one wristbands that allow users to enter theme parks, open their hotel room doors and charge food and merchandise at the theme park resort.

They also track where a person has been at Disney World.

Hours after the tweet was posted Thursday, police posted on Twitter again to cancel the be-on-the-lookout request and apologize to the Disney guests shown in the video.

Police said they learned after the first tweet that the man wearing the MagicBand in the video was not associated with the burglary in Winter Park and the information they received was not accurate.

According to a report, the burglary Winter Park police were referencing took place last month. A woman told police she and her husband woke up around 3:50 a.m. after hearing their house alarm go off, as if one of their doors had been opened and closed.

When they got up, they didn't see anyone or immediately notice anything out of place, so they went back to bed, police said. Later that morning, the woman noticed that her wallet, which contained cash, credit cards, a gift card, her driver's license and her family's annual passes to Disney, was missing from her bag, which was near the door the unknown person had entered in the middle of the night, police said.

The couple said they never saw anyone in the house, but they did see a red- or maroon-colored vehicle fleeing, the report said.

1319,SeaWorld gives sneak peek of new KareKare Curl water slide,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Aquatica Orlando gave a sneak peek of its newest attraction ahead of the ride's grand opening Friday.

KareKare Curl is a two-passenger water slide, described by designers as a high-adrenaline, weightless adventure.

""It is so much fun, particularly the drop into the vertical wall,"" Vice President of Aquatica David Heaton said. ""It just gives you that weightless feeling, such a thrill.""

KareKare, which means waves in the Maori language, is named alongside the curl derived from the curve-shaped wave at the base of the slide. Riders will experience the sensation of climbing up a vertical wave wall.

The attraction is the second opened by the water park in less than a year. Ray Rush, which opened May 2018, was named the world’s best new water ride in a nationwide poll.

""We continually look for new attractions to add to our mix of family friendly attractions, a level of thrill that our guests are looking for,"" Heaton said.

This morning, #AquaticaOrlando gave us a sneak peek of their newest attraction #KareKareCurl, which opens tomorrow. We’re showing you what it’s all about on #News6 at 12pm. pic.twitter.com/ISUhoxNMqW — Mark Lehman (@MarkLehman6) April 11, 2019

KareKare Curl is a 360-foot-long water slide and stands nearly 50 feet tall. Park officials said there is a weight limit of 250 pounds per person and 400 pounds per couple due to the design of the ride.

The total ride time is less than 45 seconds, but designers expect the attraction to keep riders coming back for more.

""If you ride it one time and you go facing forward, you may want to try it again to get the chance to ride backward,"" Heaton said. ""I think the guests are going to come back and ride this time and time again.""

KareKare Curl opens to the public at 10 a.m. Friday.

1320,April 10: EFSC baseball shuts out Rollins College; Softball drops double header to IRSC,"EFSC Titans logo (Photo: EFSC)

EFSC baseball team shut out Rollins College JV. Eastern Florida State College baseball team picked up a 3-0 victory against Rollins College JV Wednesday on the road.

Four pitchers combined on the three-hit shutout, striking out 14 hitters with no walks. Offensively, Alvaro Valdez drove in two of the three runs and Collier Rutledge had three hits.

The Titans will host ASA Miami this weekend with Friday’s game beginning at 6 p.m. and Saturday’s game starting at 1 p.m. Admission to Bruce Bochy Field is free.

EFSC softball team swept in conference doubleheader on the road. Eastern Florida State College lost both ends of a Southern Conference doubleheader on the road to Indian River State College.

In Game 1 the Titans left nine players on base while the Pioneers took a 5-0 lead early in the game. Eastern Florida State College would score in the top of the fifth inning after a couple of rain delays. Sophomore Caitlin Meyer drove in a run with a double to right-center field. It was the only run Eastern Florida State College would score in the first game, falling 6-1.

The Titans got out of the gate quickly in Game 2 behind Nikki Pennington’s ninth home run, a two-run shot in the top of the first inning. Pennington has now hit four home runs in five games against Indian River State College.

After the Pioneers scored four times in the bottom of the first inning, the Titans struck back with two more runs as Madison Neuhaus stepped to the plate with the bases loaded and hits a two-run single to tie the game. Still tied 4-4 in the top of the third, Meyer and Pennington once again drove in runs as each had RBI singles to give the Titans a 6-4 lead.

But in the bottom of the fourth inning the Pioneers scored four more times to take an 8-6 lead. It would stay that way until the bottom of the sixth inning when Indian River State College scored five times.

Hall said Collins was camping with his wife, Cindy Collins, about two weeks ago in North Florida when Collins started to feel ill.

Hall said Collins and his wife returned to Palm City and Lee Collins was diagnosed with hepatitis A by a doctor at a hospital in Martin County.

Within a week, Collins' liver began to fail and Collins was transferred to Cleveland Clinic Florida in Weston, where he received a new liver. Hall said Collins' body never accepted the liver fully and he died Sunday.

Collins' death follows the deaths of a Palm City couple, Jeffrey Kirsch and his wife, Nancy Kirsch, both 62, who were found dead in their home in Palm City March 28. Both died from complications of the virus.

Florida Department of Health's Martin County spokeswoman Renay Rouse was unable to be reached for questions Wednesday afternoon.

Hall said the two enjoyed fishing and hunting together as children and Collins went on to teach Hall's children how to fish.

1334,From the Porch Steps: What it means to 'seize the day',"'Seize the Day' is a translation of a Latin aphorism, Carpe Diem from a work called Odes by the Roman poet Horace. It certainly has stood the test of time. 'Seize the Day' was written into a song by a rock band – Avenged Sevenfold. Sam Bellow wrote a novel called “Seize the Day” which was, in turn, made into a 1986 movie about a disillusioned salesman played by Robin Williams.

So what does it mean to seize the day?

To seize the day means to live in the moment. In other words, forget yesterday and all its problems and stop worrying about what will happen tomorrow. Think instead of what you can do in the present.

I can tell you from a lifetime of experience that that isn't an easy thing to do. One of the first things you need to do is to forgive anyone who has wronged you in the past. It doesn't matter if they know it. It's just important that you know it. They probably have forgotten it anyway and gone on with their lives. Hatred from the past has a way of coloring the present and the future, not for the person who wronged you but for you, the person who remembers.

By the way, while you are forgiving others don't forget to forgive yourself. Regrets can really ruin an otherwise sunny day and a meaningful future.

Some folks live out their lives in the town in which they were born, surrounded by relatives and friends they grew up with. That can make it hard to give up past grievances but it also means that lasting friendships brighten your days and add to your future plans. When you leave home at 17 like I did, you can lose track of the people you knew in the good old days.

Folks from my hometown of Apollo used to have a summer picnic here in Florida every year for that very purpose. A cousin of mine got me interested and I attended them a couple of summers. They called it 'Apollo Day.'

It was fun to see faces from the past. I also attended a few high school class reunions until we all got too old to attend them. At our 55th we discussed a 60th reunion and I suggested that if we held it, it should be in a place that was wheel-chair accessible.

When I left home it was a scary time. Waiting at the crowded railroad station all by myself for the train that would take me further from friends and family than I had ever been in my life, made me think of all kinds of things that could go wrong. I could accidentally get on the wrong train or fall asleep on the train and miss my station. My cousin Janet and my friend Leona, who were supposed to be waiting for me when I got off the train in Washington, D.C., might meet the wrong train or forget to be there.

Of course, they were there and they spent the weekend showing me around the city on street cars. I was soon very much at home there in spite of my worries.

Sometimes at night when I have trouble sleeping I remember things I would like to forget and can't. The worst part is realizing that if I had done this or that differently I could have changed the course of my life. It is a sad and frustrating thing to do to yourself and it doesn't help you sleep. The best thing to do when that happens is to get up and do something productive that you know has to be done — do the laundry, write a letter, attend to your bill paying, check your bank account. Get yourself back to living in the moment. Sometimes, I can sleep after I get back in bed but if I can't at least I have accomplished something 'in the moment' instead of the meaningless exercise of regretting what you can't change.

I believe in prayer. It is a great way to put your mind at ease. My prayers are usually a bit unorthodox but then most of us don't always pray the way we were taught. A meaningful prayer to me is simply a talk with God.

Remember when your mother taught you to say, “Now I lay me down to sleep...?” She was laying the groundwork for your future peace of mind. She may not have been conscious of it but that is what she was doing for you. Prayer is a great way to relieve anxiety and to think positive.

Remember always that yesterday is gone, today is for action and tomorrow is full of wonderful possibilities. So 'seize the day' and do something positive for yourself or for someone else. Yesterday has passed and tomorrow will take care of itself.

1340,Chiles softball's bats picking up steam to back strikeout pitcher Dani Bauer,"The Timberwolves went 3-0 this week and have won nine of their last 10 to reach 15-5 on the year after a slow start for their offense

This was a good week for Chiles’ softball team.

In fact, the last couple weeks have been significantly better than the first half of the season.

Over their last 10 games, the Timberwolves (15-5) have won nine, including three quality games this past week over Florida High, Franklin County and Sneads.

“It took a few games,” junior third baseman Sierra Jevyak said following a 3-for-4 performance with two doubles against Franklin County. “We weren’t doing our best. But we came together as a team and we’re producing.”

Buy Photo Chiles junior Sierra Jevyak smacks a double as Chiles won 6-1 against visiting Franklin County on Wednesday, April 10, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

It was Chiles’ offense that struggled early on as it reconstructed its lineup. The Timberwolves had graduated Caroline Jacobsen – the 2017 All-Big Bend Player of the Year who currently leads Duke in home runs – as well as lead-off hitter Maegan Tomlinson, now at Florida State, and Jordan Noles, currently at Pensacola State.

In addition, Chiles lost two of its three pitchers when one graduated and one chose not to play. In total, six primary players off Chiles’ 22-4 team didn’t return.

So despite incredible promise while returning Jevyak, junior infielder Amaya Gainer, and senior pitcher Dani Bauer, it simply took time.

“We’ve gotten on the roll,” Bauer said. “Everyone has gotten used to where they are in the lineup and where they are on the field. It’s a little relaxing now. We know we can go do this.”

Buy Photo Chiles junior Amaya Gainer scores a run as Chiles won 6-1 against visiting Franklin County on Wednesday, April 10, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Bauer is 14-5 on the year with a 0.95 earned-run average. Opponents are batting just .156 against her, and she’s struck out 188 batters in 125 innings. That’s already considerably higher output and improvement over last year while going 11-1 with a 1.34 ERA and 112 strikeouts in 89 innings pitched.

“I’ve pitched for seven years now, so it has been my job. It’s what I do,” Bauer said. “I work enough hours that it’s a job and I still love it. Sometimes it's a little stressful, but when I’m in the circle you can’t think ‘If I don’t pitch good the team is going to lose.’ What will happen will happen, but I’m still going to try my best because I know I have my defense behind me.”

LAST YEAR: White's walk-off lifts Chiles to district title over Lincoln

In her five losses, Chiles’ offense provided a total of four runs. Bauer averaged 10 strikeouts in each of those games and didn’t allow any more than three runs, yet she was saddled with losses as the offense struggled.

“We have a young team right now, so it just took a little bit,” Bauer said. “We just had to get in a groove, get used to each other, and meld together. It’s understandable in the beginning because we had more sophomores and juniors than seniors. I can understand why it was a little slow in the beginning.”

Fourth-year Timberwolves head coach Cyndi Jevyak thinks her kids just put too much pressure on themselves.

Jevyak and Gainer had been used to hitting above .400, and now they were being called upon to replace the production of Jacobsen or have an even bigger season.

Hitting doesn’t work that way.

“A lot of it is in their head – it was just mental,” Jevyak said. “Our goal was to be positive. If you keep hitting it, eventually it will fall. Sometimes as a coach you wonder if there’s something else you could be doing, is it the right approach, but we have good kids that can hit the ball, and it was just a matter of being consistent and staying positive. Eventually it would turn.”

Sophomore Ashlynn Pauwels currently leads Chiles in average (.386), RBI (23) and home runs (3). Junior Megan Monk is at .379, while Jevyak (.356) and Gainer (.348) have seen their averages steadily increase with recent hot stretches.

Gainer had two hits and scored her team’s only run – driven in by Monk – against Sneads for a 1-0 victory. The best thing about that game was the Timberwolves didn’t have an error defensively, which had been a trouble spot.

Chiles’ only loss recently was to Lincoln, 2-1, which ended a 14-game winning streak against the Trojans. The Timberwolves were given a reprieve in the district standings when Leon upset Lincoln, 6-5, this week to put Chiles back in the driver’s seat for the No. 1 seed.

“It’s the little things,” Sierra Jevyak said. “The little things matter – getting a bunt down when we’re supposed to, executing. That’s what hurt us.”

In her second year at Chiles, Bauer has continued to pitch lights out, throwing a one-hitter against Florida High and striking out 36 batters in three games this week. She’s also been a more vocal leader as one of four seniors on the 14-player roster.

“She’s not afraid to tell it like it is,” Cyndi Jevyak said. “She’s a firecracker, and you wouldn’t know that by looking at her. She’s certainly stepped up in her role. She will let the girls know when they need to step it up or do a better job or regroup. She’s been a good spark plug for us.”

Chiles, which has won 20 or more games for the past three seasons, has four regular-season games remaining over the next two weeks to build upon its current momentum and potentially reach that mark again.

It will be a tough four games, too – Marianna (16-0), Wakulla (15-2), Wewahitchka (12-5) and Holmes County (15-5). The Timberwolves lost to the Bulldogs and War Eagles earlier in the year and needed eight innings to top Holmes County.

But it’s a less scary proposition now than if they were still struggling.

“The girls have put the work in and they’re starting to peak,” Cyndi Jevyak said. “There have been times where we peaked really early and then struggled at the end, so now we’re starting to get a little warm. We just keep telling the girls to stay relaxed at the plate and have fun out there.

“Don’t put pressure on yourself. Just go out there and play the game. If we lose because we played the game we should, hats off to them.”

1341,Defense questions forensic evidence in Michael Haim trial,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Was Bonnie Haim's body moved to where it was found buried in 2014? Was she shot? What could be learned from 10 synthetic fingernails found with her?

The forensic pathologist who reconstructed her remains after Haim's now-grown son found her skull under a concrete slab in the backyard of the home where the family lived in January 1993 when his mother disappeared.

WATCH: Gavel-to-gavel coverage of trial

Dr. Heather Walsh-Haney spent two hours on the stand Thursday in what is expected to be the final day of testimony in the second-degree murder trial of Michael Haim. She answered questions about what she found and what she could learn from the remains from them -- including a circular injury on the woman's pelvis bone and a .22-caliber slug found that could have caused it.

Micahel Haim's defense fought any suggestion that it could be proven that the injury, which they called ""defect,"" could be proven it was from a bullet hole, or that the body was moved at some point after her death.

Lawyer: ""You cannot say that indentation, defect, is a bullet hole?""

Walsh-Haney: ""All I can say is it is a post- injury.""

Lawyer: ""You can also not rule out that this could be a secondary or tertiary burial site?""

Walsh-Haney: ""Correct.""

Just before noon, Robert Hinson, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office lead homicide investigator in the original 1993 case, took the stand. Expect a lengthy cross-examination, as he was singled out in the defense's opening statement about sloppy police work.

On Wednesday, two inmates testified that Michael Haim confessed to killing his wife while he was in jail with them in 2015.

""He started talking about, you know, how he killed his wife. How he choked her, how her son was mad at him. He buried her in the yard,"" Terrance Richardson said.

But for every minute Richardson and the second inmate, Keshaun Callwood, answered questions for the prosecution, the defense spent at least two minutes detailing their arrest records, the aliases they have used and their history of not telling the truth.

One of the inmates said that, even though he is a 300-pound man, he feared for his safety when he shared a cell with Michael Haim.

While police considered the husband their prime suspect ever since Bonnie Haim disappeared in January 1993, he was not arrested until the couple's son -- who was 3½ years old at the time -- found her skull while taking out a pool and shower while renovating the property for sale in 2014.

Much of Wednesday's testimony concerned forensic evidence, including graphic photos of the recovery of Bonnie Haim's remains.

The day ended with a medical examiner describing the condition of the remains and the Bonnie Haim's likely cause of death.

SLIDESHOW: Crime scene photos

Former Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents and a retired Jacksonville detective reviewed crime-scene photos of the recovery of Bonne Haim's remains in 2014, plus evidence of the recovery of her purse and abandoned car near Jacksonville International Airport in the first hours after she was reported missing a quarter-century ago.

Defense attorneys grilled former FDLE crime analyst Alan Miller about why the body wasn't found earlier.

Lawyer: ""Are you able, as you sit here today, to say that the body was not in the yard on March 17th (1993) when you did that search?""

Miller: ""I can't say, No.""

Lawyer: ""Is it significantly possible you missed her?""

Miller: ""Oh, yes.""

Lawyer: ""Why do you say that?'

Miller: ""Well, for one, she was found under the pallet. Her remains were found under the pallet. And we didn't search under that. There was nothing about that that led us to believe it had ever been moved.""

Haim's defense attorney, Janis Warren, told the jury Tuesday that prosecutors do not have enough evidence to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

""We agree she's dead. We agree that's her body in the backyard. But they have to prove to you that he did it,"" she said.

1343,"Prince Harry, Meghan aim to keep baby arrival plans private","Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. AP photo

LONDON (AP) - Prince Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, say they have decided to keep plans around their first baby's arrival private.

Kensington Palace officials said in a statement Thursday that Harry and Meghan ""look forward"" to sharing the news of their baby's birth once they have had a chance to celebrate privately as a new family.

The decision means that Harry and Meghan are not likely to pose for the world's photographers and TV crews on the hospital steps with their newborn, a break from the royal tradition followed by Prince William and his wife Kate, the duchess of Cambridge, when she gave birth to their three children.

As a future king, William is expected to help mark great occasions, while Harry - sixth in the line of succession - has more leeway. Both have in the past expressed deep misgivings about intrusive press coverage.

Harry and Meghan - an American actress best known for her work on ""Suits"" - wed in May in a spectacular, internationally televised ceremony at Windsor Castle.

They are expecting their first child in late April or early May. The palace press office has announced very few details about their plans, refusing to comment on unconfirmed British press reports that Meghan may opt for a home birth.

Harry and Meghan say they have not learned the gender of their baby.

The couple recently moved from central London to a more secluded house near their wedding venue.

They said in their statement they are grateful for the goodwill messages they have received from around the world.",https://www.wfla.com/entertainment/prince-harry-meghan-to-keep-baby-arrival-plans-private/1916674828,2019-04-11T11:18:15Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1344,National sports reporter tours Baptist Health's unique operating room,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - It's unique operating room for heart patients.

Baptist Medical Center's new Hybrid Operating Room can immediately convert to handle a full medical team if a patient's condition changes and full-fledged open-heart surgery is suddenly needed.

""I've been doing this for 10 years and have never needed to convert to open,"" said Dr. Ruby Satpathy, an interventional cardiologist at Baptist Health Center. ""But we are always prepared because if we need to convert to open, we need to convert in 2 minutes 30 seconds.""

In town on Wednesday to help tout the new technology was national sports reporter Jennifer Hale, who's been haunted by her own heart condition.

#FOXSports reporter @JenHale504 is in #Jacksonville today for our Sisisky-Kleppinger Endowed Annual Lecture for Women’s Health at @WJCTJax, but first she toured our Cardiovascular Hybrid OR at #BaptistJax. pic.twitter.com/ExO5Uf3AQX — Baptist Health (@BaptistHealthJx) April 10, 2019

""Leading up to diagnosis, I had strange symptoms,"" Hale said. ""Right before diagnosis, I felt my feet and legs swell up significantly and that's when I said, 'This must be something other than fatigue.'""

At 38 years old, Hale was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. Her heart was enlarged and was only pumping at about 16%.

She was sent to a heart specialist in New Orleans who gave her medicine to reduce the size of her heart and she was outfitted with a defibrillator for eight months to shock her heart if it were to stop.

""I am so grateful for modern medicine because it turns out that my father, uncle and grandfather all died of this, as well. We thought it was heart attacks, but it was heart disease,"" Hale said. ""It's amazing that in a 20-year span, I can take a couple of pills and I am back to my normal self, whereas it was a death sentence for the rest of my family members.""

She's beyond thankful there's treatment for her condition -- the same ailment that killed her father, uncle and grandfather. After her experience, she was impressed touring Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville's Hybrid Operating Room.

""Obviously, it is about saving lives, but to me, the big part of it was the mental battle -- the fact that a patient can get a new heart valve and walk out of here in a few hours,"" Hale said. ""What that does to you mentally, I promise you, it is huge.""

Two years after being diagnosed, Hale's heart medicine has worked so well that she was taken off a heart transplant list.

She also spoke Wednesday night at a women's health gathering, encouraging everyone to know their family's health history, so you can catch hidden conditions sooner for a better chance at fixing it.

1345,Palm City man may be 3rd person to die from hepatitis A complications,"MARTIN COUNTY — Lee Collins was the type of man who everyone loved, his brother Robert Hall said.

""He had a very outgoing personality and was incredibly helpful,"" Hall said. ""If you had a problem he'd be there for you from start to finish.""

Collins is the third person in Palm City whose death might be attributed to complications of the hepatitis A virus in the past month.

Department of Health officials in Martin County could not be reached Wednesday to confirm whether that's the case.

But according to his brother, Collins, 61, of the 4200 block of Southwest 83rd Street in Palm City, died Sunday from complications of the virus.

Hall said Collins was camping with his wife, Cindy Collins, about two weeks ago in North Florida when Collins started to feel ill.

He said his brother and his wife returned to Palm City and Lee Collins was diagnosed with hepatitis A by a doctor at a hospital in Martin County.

Within a week, Collins' liver began to fail and Collins was transferred to Cleveland Clinic Florida in Weston, where he received a new liver. Hall said Collins' body never accepted the liver fully and he died Sunday.

More: Martin County 'high risk' for hepatitis A

Collins' death follows the deaths of a Palm City couple, Jeffrey Kirsch and his wife, Nancy Kirsch, both 62, who were found dead in their home in Palm City March 28. Both died from complications of the virus, according to the Treasure Coast Medical Examiner's office.

Hall said he and his brother enjoyed fishing and hunting together as children and Collins went on to teach Hall's children how to fish.

""He (Collins) loved plants, his yard and everything that all of us would love to do,"" Hall said. ""Everything he did was 100 percent.""

There have been 16 confirmed cases of hepatitis A in Martin County this year; two cases reported in St. Lucie County and none in Indian River County, according to data from the Florida Department of Health.

Martin County was considered a ""high risk"" area once the county surpassed five confirmed cases of the virus April 1.

So far this year, there have been 690 cases statewide.

At least 15 other states are experiencing hepatitis A outbreaks.

1346,"Woman falls to death after hanging over balcony at Daytona hotel, police say","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - A 19-year-old woman fell to her death shortly after she was seen hanging over the balcony railing of her hotel room, according to the Daytona Beach Police Department.

Police said witnesses reported the woman had been yelling during an argument with her boyfriend in their Holiday Inn Resort room Tuesday night. A witness in the unit next door said the woman was hanging over the railing in a squatted position with her feet on the balcony, holding the railing and leaning backward while repeatedly yelling, ""Tell me I won't,"" according to the report.

The woman crawled over the railing back onto the balcony shortly before hotel security knocked on the couple's door. After security left, the woman began yelling that the neighbors owed her $300 for calling security, which prompted an argument between the teen and a woman staying in the room below hers, police said.

Witnesses said the woman went back into her room and they heard yelling, glass breaking and then a scream. Police said the woman was found dead on the ground after the six-story fall.

Surveillance video showed the woman's boyfriend trying to pull her back onto the balcony about five times, according to the report.

1347,Gerry's Firebread in Fort Myers puts American twists on a classic Hungarian treat,"At Gerry's Firebread in Fort Myers, an Austrian couple has given a Hungarian-Romanian bread recipe some uniquely American twists.

Gerry’s Firebread in Fort Myers smelled of freshly baked bread.

There was the savory hint of fried onions and garlic, as well as a sweeter background note of cinnamon. At the work counter, husband and wife owners Gerald and Sonja Schimpl rolled out puffy rounds of dough. They cut the dough into strips, wrapping each around a cone-shaped wooden block. They set the dough to bake in a special oven imported from Romania.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

The result: a fresh-baked cone of bread perfect for loading with Gerry's sweet and savory fillings.

Gerald calls these creations firebread, a term he said he coined and patented. But his background isn't in baking. Gerald actually came from Europe's shipping and trucking industry.

After eating kurtoskalacs or “chimney cakes” at a Christmas market in Hungary, the couple decided to try their hand at making the traditional Eastern European bread. In their native Austria, they launched a wholesale business making kurtoskalacs for restaurants, gas stations and markets.

Then they got the itch to travel.

More: Ciao, fueled by scratch-made Italian fare, has thrived in Cape Coral

More: From Bourguignon to macarons, My Sweet Art isn't just a bakery

More: Danger, Danger is here: Cape Coral restaurant makes hotly anticipated debut

The Schimpls journeyed around Europe, South America and the Caribbean before coming to the United States and settling in Key West. Afterward, they moved to Fort Myers and decided to launch their firebread business.

In February 2018 they started going to markets and festivals across South Florida, where they set up a tent and offered their unique firebread sandwiches and treats. The pair worried whether the concept would work here.

Now, Gerald laughs at the thought.

“Was it popular?” he asked. “We had lines over lines.”

One bite of the firebread, and it’s easy to see why. Gerry's savory sandwich options include the Cubano, the chicken gyro with house-made tzatziki, the pulled pork sandwich and the bratwurst in firebread.

The firebread itself comes in flavors such as garlic, fried onion, black olive and bacon. The dessert versions use a stickier, sweeter dough which is rolled in cinnamon and sugar and filled with ice cream.

In December 2018, the Schimpls opened their first brick-and-mortar shop in the former Happiness Healthy Cafe space on Cleveland Avenue in Fort Myers.

It’s become their base of operations to prepare firebread for their festival and market events as well as catering orders. The shop is open throughout the week for people to stop in and buy firebread sandwiches and treats, but the hours vary. An updated list of times and dates is available on their website and social-media feeds. Customers can also find the sweet firebread cones at Ice Sssscreamin in Cape Coral.

Though the roots of the firebread are Hungarian and Romanian, Gerald calls he and his wife's creation “a 100 percent American thing.” Germans, Austrians, Hungarians and Romanians might recognize the sweet firebread, but they wouldn’t be familiar with the savory sandwiches, he says.

Those are a result of Sonja’s expert cooking and Gerald’s taste preferences.

“I’m a meat guy, not a sweet guy,” he said.

For their made-in-America products, the Schimpls are starting to think about the next phase — franchising. After a successful day at the Cuban Sandwich Festival in Tampa last month, they’ve already fielded multiple calls about franchise opportunities.

“Our first step was to see if the people were loving this or hating this,” Gerald said. “Now we know they’re loving it.”

1348,Vice President Mike Pence says during Florida visit 'no one should fear for their safety in place of worship',"CLOSE Vice President Mike Pence discusses ISIS during a visit to Ave Maria University on Thursday, March 28, 2019. Alex Driehaus, Naples Daily News

AVA MARIA — Vice President Mike Pence, in a speech to a friendly audience Thursday at Ave Maria University, decried attacks on religious freedom.

""Freedom of religion is increasingly under attack,"" Pence said at the university located northeast of Naples. ""These attacks on believing Christians and Christian education are wrong and they must stop.""

Pence's Florida visit came just a day before President Trump planned a trip to Lake Okeechobee Friday.

The White House announced Thursday evening the president will tour ""the Lake Okeechobee area"" aboard the Marine One helicopter and visit the Herbert Hoover Dike and talk about progress on projects on and near the lake around 2 p.m. Friday.

In 2015, Pence, who was governor of Indiana at the time, signed a ""religious freedom"" bill into law. The bill was met with criticism that it allowed discrimination against the LGBTQ community.

Pence defended his wife, Karen Pence, who teaches in Virginia at the Immanuel Christian School, which refuses to enroll LGBTQ students.

Earlier this month, Pence gave a similar speech on religious freedom to the Conservative Political Action Conference.

Pence said Christians are persecuted in the United States and throughout the world, but he also cited the recent terrorist attacks on two mosques in New Zealand, where 50 people were killed.

He went on to condemn anti-Semitism.

""It's rearing its ugly head around the Earth and even in the halls of Congress,"" Pence said.

He did not specifically refer to any member of Congress or event.

However, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, was criticized earlier this month for her comments regarding Israel and its influence in U.S. politics. Her comments were deemed anti-Semitic and denounced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders.

Pence had been greeted by a crowd of about 100 people at Naples Airport when Air Force Two touched down just after 10 a.m. Pence was scheduled to attend a private Victory Trump event in Naples After he left Ave Maria, before flying to Jacksonville for another one.

Religious freedom was only part of Pence's speech. The vice president also touched on abortion, calling President Donald Trump ""the most pro-life president in American history.""

Pence received loud applause when he reiterated his pledge to defund Planned Parenthood through legislation.

He recalled Ave Maria's lawsuit against the federal government over a mandate by the Affordable Care Act that employer-provided insurance cover birth control pills and other contraceptives.

In 2014, a federal court granted Ave Maria's injunction to avoid providing contraceptives and paying about $17 million in fees.

""Not only did Ave Maria refuse to comply with that mandate,” Pence said. “You challenged it and you won.”

The Affordable Care Act, also called ""Obamacare,"" has “failed,” said Pence, who added that the GOP will become a party of health care.

Recently, Trump reaffirmed his administration's intention to eliminate ""Obamacare.""

Pence referred to Trump on several occasions, and the audience applauded at nearly all mentions.

Pence thanked U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami, for his work to bring attention to Venezuela's political crisis. Diaz-Balart, who represents much of Collier County, received a standing ovation.

Fabiana Rosales de Guaido, the wife of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, met with Trump on Wednesday at the White House. Pence called Guaido the ""rightful president of Venezuela.""

Earlier this month: After mini-vacation on Sanibel Island, Vice President Pence returns to political world

Pence also addressed Ave Maria students directly. The private Catholic university with just more than 1,000 students welcomed Pence inside the Thomas and Selby Prince building. The event was closed to the public, but about 400 seats were filled, many by students.

""Just think of me as a warm-up act for commencement in a couple weeks,"" Pence said.

Freshman Kelly McCreary, 19, said she attended Pence's speech to hear ideas; 2020 will be her first time voting in a presidential election.

""I'm more here just to listen than to learn,"" McCreary said. ""I'm still kind of new to the political world, so I'm not sure where I stand on any issues.""

Pence closed his speech by calling for students to be leaders, especially during the next 16 to 18 months leading up to the election. He urged students to persevere as people challenge their religion or criticize them for their beliefs.

""People follow people that they trust,"" Pence said.

TALLAHASSEE — The Florida legislature is considering making it possible for people to have legal documents notarized online.

The bill, HB 409, would make signing official documents, such as a will or power of attorney, quicker and more convenient in the state. Critics have expressed concerns that greater convenience could lead to more fraud, especially among the elderly.

The bill, proposed by Rep. Daniel Perez, R-Miami, moved Tuesday through the House transportation and tourism appropriations subcommittee and will be considered next in the Judiciary Committee, the final step before a House vote. A Senate version hasn't made as much progress.

Perez said he had traveled to Colombia recently, and he realized as he boarded the plane that he forgot to assign power of attorney to his in-laws. Requiring his appearance in person before a Florida-commissioned notary made it impossible to fix his oversight, he said. ""God forbid anything happens,"" he said.

The bill survived efforts by two Democrats that would have limited its scope. Rep. Barbara Watson, D-Miami Gardens, compared the risks of fraud under the system to college students who buy fake IDs to drink alcohol illegally. She proposed requiring notary witnesses to be in the same place physically as whoever is signing legal documents.

""When we have no one tangibly looking at this information, not having it in their hands for close inspection to verify its validity, we're in trouble,"" Watson said.

Rep. Ben Diamond, D-St. Petersburg, said allowing wills and powers of attorney to be created online was risky for Florida's elderly. He said lawmakers need to balance between better business and protecting older residents.

""I have a concern about someone going into a nursing home with an iPad and walking room to room and getting people to click buttons and then they get a couple of powers of attorney,"" Diamond said.

Perez said it was possible for fraudster to take advantage of elderly people even with the current notary requirements.

""You can change bad policy, but you can't change bad actors,"" he said.

Attorneys from the Florida Bar are split. Lawyers from the organization's Real Property Probate and Trust Law section said the proposal puts the elderly at greater risk of fraud, while lawyers from the Elder Law section said the online services will make it easier for Florida's older population to plan estates.

When former Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a similar bill in 2017, attorney Shannon Miller thought his letter explaining the veto echoed concerns she had raised.

Miller and others from the Elder Law section helped draft this year's bill, she said.

""This legislation has been pending for about the last three years, and the Elder Law Section has never supported it because they haven't let us have a seat at the table,"" Miller said. ""We think that this year when they brought us in and said, 'How can you help us make it safer for people who are most vulnerable?' They did everything that we asked them to do.""

The bar's section proposed changes to the bill that would exclude ""vulnerable adults"" — people whose abilities to perform normal, daily activities are impaired — from using an online notary. It's not required to record obtaining a will today, but the new online method would create video documenting the event.

The bill also added requiring the notary to ask whether the person creating a will was under the influence of drugs or under 18. Those questions are not required for obtaining power of attorney through this legislation.

Zayne Smith, a lobbyist for AARP, supports the bill, comparing the online notary technology to telemedicine that already exists.

""We trust our doctors and our medical professionals to use technology to do their services, why can't we expect the same of the legal community?"" Smith said.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190327/florida-may-allow-legal-papers-to-be-notarized-online?rssfeed=true,2019-03-27T09:50:00Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
1357,Ares gun range neighbors say sniper competition violated permit,"LEESBURG – Neighbors of a recently permitted gun range are concerned that it has already violated its conditional use permit by hosting an event last weekend.

The range denies they even hosted the event, during which participants apparently used state lands without permission.

Treasure Island Gun range, also known as Ares Firearms Training, received a conditional use permit from the county last month that allows the range, which was previously private, to operate commercially with some restrictions.

For now, Ares is closed, as the permit requires inspections and county approval of range facilities before it can operate.

But according to multiple websites, the range was scheduled to host an event from April 5 to 7. The Real World Sniper Challenge, sponsored by Dark Corner Concepts, listed Ares as the location of its event on its calendar and on a document detailing the event schedule. Ares is also listed as a sponsor for the sniper challenge and was tagged in many photos on Instagram leading up to the event. Mission 22, a nonprofit organization with the goal of fighting veteran suicide, also published the event, listing Ares as the host, on its website.

Both the lawyer for the range and a woman who answered the phone for Ares on Friday said there no event that weekend. Calls and an email to Dark Corner Concepts were not returned. And a spokeswoman for Mission 22 said the organization was invited to participate but didn’t because there were “issues.”

Many photos on social media that appear to have been taken at the event have not been published with location details. But Ares’ Instagram account was tagged in a couple photos that referenced the event. http://bit.ly/2UWu3Nq

The caption on one of those photos starts out: “Climbing fences (lawfully, with permission, during appropriate operating hours) & chilling with snipers.” http://bit.ly/2Z6CHZ0

Ares’ conditional use permit specifies hours of operation, limits the use of certain materials on property and sets a maximum number of annual special events. It also requires the range be closed on the first Sunday of every month. This month, that was April 7.

The sniper event scheduled that weekend was “designed to honor the sniper craft and community though a series of mental and physical challenges under a variety of stressors,” according to the Dark Corner Concepts website.

“Competitors are expected to arrive physically prepared to move themselves and their equipment up to 2 miles between stages along improved roads and over terrain. Each team member must be capable of operating independently as well as a cohesive unit,” the event description said.

On Saturday, April 6, area resident Bill Vogel said he ran into some of the event participants in the Emeralda Marsh Conservation Area, which abuts the Ares property. On his bike ride, he also photographed targets in the conservation area that were apparently set up for the event. One of them was a propane tank.

Vogel said he asked the participants if they had permission to set up targets in the conservation area, which is owned by St. Johns River Water Management District.

One of them told him that the sniper event was sanctioned by the U.S. Government, and “they had every right to be out there,” Vogel said.

Vogel said he reminded them that the permit requires Ares to be closed on the first Sunday a month, and they replied, “We’re not on Ares' site,” Vogel said.

He added that he saw that they were parked on Ares property, but, “technically they were not on Ares land.”

Word spread throughout the neighborhood, and neighbors called both St. Johns and Lake County Code Enforcement.

Teresa Monson, a spokeswoman for St. Johns said the District did not issue any special use authorization for that area, which is currently closed to the public because of stray gun fire from the range.

When asked if the district would pursue legal action, she wrote in an email: “Generally, district counsel does not disclose legal strategies before taking action.”

Code enforcement ultimately did not find Ares to be operating. And the targets were apparently taken down by the time officers arrived Sunday.

Monson said that the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission and code enforcement officers told district staff that they did not find targets.

At the final approval hearing for the range’s permit last month, neighbors talked about this upcoming event, worried that snipers would be traversing their neighborhood.

It was one of many concerns neighbors brought before the Lake County Commission during the range’s months-long permitting process. Ultimately, the commission approved the permit 4-1. Wendy Breeden was the only “no” vote.

At the meetings, neighbors pointed to prior events where people shot machine guns out of helicopters. They said visitors’ clogged their residential roads. Some said exploding targets broke their windows.

Some of their concerns were addressed in the permit. The range won’t be able to shoot from helicopters. They’re required to hire off-duty law enforcement to direct traffic during special events. And exploding targets are banned.

In the hearings, Brent Spain, the range’s attorney, said they agreed to these concessions to be a good neighbor.

So far, Louise Chen, who lives nearby, is wary.

When asked if she thought the range is being a good neighbor, she replied, “No.”",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190413/ares-gun-range-neighbors-say-sniper-competition-violated-permit?rssfeed=true,2019-04-13T06:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
1360,WikiLeaks founder unlikely to be extradited to US soon,"<p>The battle between WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the American government was always going to be epic, involving concepts like free speech, journalists' rights, national interests, even treason.</p><p>As Assange settles in to his first night in British custody, his allies and enemies alike are gearing up for what promises to be a long, dogged legal slog, not only over his possible extradition to the U.S. but over how U.S. courts should view his actions, which sharply cleave public opinion.</p><p>Yet in a way, Assange has been fighting this battle for much of the past decade. The struggle has taken him through a ""mansion arrest"" in the English countryside; a dramatic escape into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London; a multimillion-pound U.K. police siege of the embassy that has strained government coffers; and even a bizarre attempt to turn him into a Moscow-based diplomat.</p><p>Whatever happens now, one thing is clear: Assange, who was dragged out of the embassy and arrested Thursday by British police after Ecuador withdrew his political asylum, is not going anywhere soon. Extradition to the United States could take years more.</p><p>Assange's saga kicked off in November 2010, when his publication of 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables that month left American officialdom apoplectic. Joe Biden, then-U.S. vice president, compared Assange to a ""high-tech terrorist."" Sarah Palin, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, called for him to be hunted down by U.S. troops like an al-Qaida operative.</p><p>Tempers at the top eventually cooled -- Palin would later apologize to Assange after he began publishing material about U.S. Democrats. As a candidate, President Donald Trump startled many Americans by repeatedly praising WikiLeaks.</p><p>But in the U.S. intelligence community, the rage against Assange lingered. On the sidelines of a conference a few years ago, a former senior National Security Agency official told an Associated Press journalist that all he wanted was a couple of minutes alone with Assange in a dark alley, grasping his hands together as if he were crushing a man's windpipe.</p><p>Assange seemed to sense that the release of the diplomatic cables, which also enraged and embarrassed other countries around the world, were the point of no return.</p><p></p><p>It's often forgotten that Assange once traveled easily to the United States, appearing at the National Press Club in Washington on April 2010 to present ""Collateral Murder,"" the title he chose for the camera footage that captured American helicopter pilots laughing as they fired at a crowd of civilians they mistook for Iraqi insurgents.</p><p>Shortly after his visit, his source for the video -- an American Army intelligence analyst now named Chelsea Manning -- would be arrested after an ill-advised online confession. Assange dropped out of sight, likely aware that the government now had spools of conversations between him and Manning, including the one that now forms the centerpiece of the Justice Department's newly unveiled indictment against Assange for conspiracy to hack into a U.S. government computer.</p><p>For a while, Assange gravitated to the Frontline Club in London, the convivial journalists' hangout where he dropped one media bombshell after another in collaboration with the Guardian newspaper and other media outlets. But staying in Britain, a close ally of the United States, was risky.</p><p>In a fateful move, Assange decided to scope out Sweden, a country with powerful press protections and where he had already located some of WikiLeaks' servers. The expedition would prove to be a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Two women he stayed with there would soon go to the police with allegations of sexual assault and rape. The prosecution nearly tore WikiLeaks apart and threated the upcoming publication the U.S. diplomatic cables.</p><p>With Sweden out of the question and ""Cablegate"" sure to enrage the Americans further, Assange looked to Moscow. A document published by the AP last year showed he considered the idea of getting a Russian visa through his friend and sometimes WikiLeaks collaborator, Israel Shamir.</p><p>Assange would eventually get the visa, Shamir said later, but it came several weeks too late. Sweden had already applied for an Interpol Red Notice, something akin to an international arrest warrant, making travel all but impossible. That left Assange little choice but to turn himself in on Dec. 7, 2010, to British authorities.</p><p>Things only got more surreal from there.</p><p>Assange was granted bail at the country mansion of Frontline's founder, Vaughan Smith, receiving a stream of well-heeled and rebellious visitors in rural Norfolk while his London legal battle against extradition went all the way to Britain's Supreme Court. When that court finally turned him down, Assange dyed his hair, popped in colored contacts and skipped bail, fleeing to the Ecuadorian Embassy.</p><p>From there, he carried on as before, albeit in a more constricted space. When the AP visited him in 2012, he occupied a back room in the embassy scattered with laptops, some marked ""Do not connect to the internet."" When discussing an upcoming leak, Assange took a reporter into the corridor between his office and the bathroom, speaking in a whisper in a bid to baffle the high-tech surveillance thought to be deployed against him.</p><p>The embassy stalemate dragged on for years, costing the British government millions in policing costs.</p><p>But it didn't stop Assange from publishing new material, notably in 2016, when his disclosure of U.S. Democratic Party documents stolen by Russian hackers hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential election campaign.</p><p>But if Assange had hoped for leniency from America's new president, he would soon be disappointed. Twitter messages between WikiLeaks and Trump's eldest son, Donald Jr., showed the group lobbying him to get his father to suggest that Australia appoint its native son Assange to be its ambassador to the U.S.</p><p>Instead, the Trump administration promoted him to public enemy; in a 2017 speech, then-CIA director Mike Pompeo described WikiLeaks as a ""hostile non-state intelligence agency.""</p><p>Meanwhile, Assange wasn't getting much more satisfaction from his Latin American host, which was increasingly embarrassed by its houseguest's publications. The government of Ecuador tried all kinds of creative solutions to break the embassy impasse, including an abortive attempt to send Assange to Russia under diplomatic cover. When it became clear that the WikiLeaks founder wasn't leaving -- and that he wouldn't curb his publications to suit Ecuador's diplomatic interests -- the government looked for a way to wash its hands of him.</p><p>Tensions had been building for more than a year, but the Thursday morning raid in London was still a surprise. WikiLeaks had issued one of its periodic warnings that Assange was at risk, but at a Wednesday press conference, his longtime lieutenant, Kristinn Hrafnsson, told journalists that Assange's eviction from the embassy had been averted.</p><p>It's not clear what comes next, but it will almost certainly be complicated.</p><p>The interactions quoted in the U.S. indictment are nothing new -- Assange's instant message exchange with Manning has been in the public domain ever since the latter's court-martial -- so Assange's high-powered legal team has had years to prepare their arguments. And Britain has generally tended to favor accused hackers fighting extradition to America.</p><p>Lauri Love, a friend of Assange's who was accused of penetrating U.S. government networks, was last year spared extradition after Britain's high court ruled in his favor. British hacker Gary McKinnon, accused of breaking into U.S. military and space networks, won his fight against extradition in 2012 after a decade-long struggle.</p><p>Assange's fight may not take a decade, but he's unlikely to see the inside of a U.S. courtroom anytime soon.</p>",https://www.local10.com/lifestyle/legal-news/wikileaks-founder-unlikely-to-be-extradited-to-us-soon,2019-04-12T04:03:05Z,WPLG,Couple,"3401 W Hallandale Beach Blvd, Pembroke Park, FL 33023, USA",FL,33023

MARTIN COUNTY — County, state and health department officials are expected to discuss Friday a plan for protecting the public from hepatitis A.

Lt. Gov. Jeanette Núñez, State Sen. Gayle Harrell, State Rep. Brian Mast, Martin County Sheriff William Snyder, county commissioners, and local and state health department officials are among those expected to be talking about the county's outbreak of hepatitis A announced last week, said sheriff's spokeswoman Christine Christofek.

There will be a press conference about it Friday morning, she said.

""Our goal is to ensure Martin County residents have access to the information and resources needed to make the best decisions for themselves and their families about Hepatitis A,"" said Martin County Board of County Commissioners Chairman Ed Ciampi in a news release.

No other information was available about it Thursday afternoon.

Florida Department of Health's Martin County spokeswoman Renay Rouse was unable to be reached Wednesday or so far Thursday for any new information about the hepatitis A outbreak.

A Palm City married couple died the end of March, with the cause of death ""complications from hepatitis A,"" according to the Treasure Coast Medical Examiner's office. A third person from Palm City, who had been diagnosed with hepatitis A, died this week related to complications from the virus, his brother said.

Since the beginning of the year, there have been 16 reported cases of the virus in the county, according to a Tuesday report from the Martin County Department of Health.

The county became ""high risk"" when there were five confirmed cases on April 1.

St. Lucie County has two reported cases; Indian River County has none.

So far this year, there have been 690 cases statewide.

The Broward County Health Department confirmed Thursday there have been seven cases of adults with Hepatitis A since the first of the year, making it a high-risk county for the virus.

Broward’s reported cases follows Palm Beach County, which also confirmed this week it had reached the outbreak threshold of five cases, making it a high-risk zone.

Palm Beach County reported six cases, with five of them recorded within the past 50 days.

At least 15 other states are experiencing hepatitis A outbreaks.

Hepatitis A is a “highly contagious liver infection” caused by the hepatitis A virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Rarely does it cause death. Most who get hepatitis A feel sick for weeks, but usually recover with no lasting liver damage.

1362,"Homeless count up in the region, down in county","An annual count of the homeless in the five-county region that includes Alachua County shows a 6% increase in the number of people living outdoors.

But Alachua County — which has the vast majority of homeless residents in the region — had a 7% decrease.

According to this year's Point-in-Time count, Alachua County's total went from 833 in 2018 to 773 in 2019.

The snapshot count found that across the five-county North Central Florida region — Alachua, Bradford, Gilchrist, Levy and Putnam counties — 804 individuals and families were homeless, compared with 756 last year.

The survey counts those who reported staying in places not meant for human habitation, or who were in emergency shelter or transitional housing, said Mona Gil de Gibaja, president of the United Way of North Central Florida. However, the count does not include persons or families who are living with family and friends or ""couch surfing.""

Hundreds of children are believed to fit that category, she said, but are not included in the count as homeless.

The annual count is taken during a 24-hour span. Alachua County's count was Jan. 23, the four nearby counties tabbed the homeless Jan. 24-25.

This was the first year that the United Way of North Central Florida Alliance for the Homeless and Hungry was lead agency for count.

The 2019 count is about 6% higher than that of 2018, Gil de Gibaja said. But, every year the alliance members work to improve the process used to conduct the count, which may have contributed to the higher number, she said.

The overall trend in the homeless population is down, by 36 percent since 2014.

This year, more people went out to rural areas and worked with locals in the community who are familiar with where the homeless live, whether it be on streets, tents or in cars, she said.

More than 50 volunteers counted 302 sheltered and 502 unsheltered homeless individuals. In last year's tally, there were 323 sheltered and 433 unsheltered, a total of 756 homeless.

Gil de Gibaja believes there should be a two-fold call to action.

First, she hopes to educate the community on the true needs of the homeless, and second, more landlords, apartment managers and property owners need to be willing to make an apartment available to a homeless individual or family and work with case managers to assist in finding permanent housing for them.

“More and more people would be willing to assist to reduce homelessness quicker than we are able to just as nonprofit providers, city and county government,” she said. “I think folks can help us in ways they haven’t thought of before because we haven’t asked.”

The alliance meets every other month, and there are subcommittees that meet monthly, Gil de Gibaja said. One is a housing subcommittee that has been talking to landlords for almost two years.

“More and more are saying yes and want to work with different agencies to find permanent housing for homeless folks, but we still don’t have enough,” she said.

This year, there are 261 chronically homeless people.

“We hope we can house more of the chronically homeless because they are dealing with many issues that can lead to more medical or physical problems which can decline their mental and physical health,” Gil de Gibaja said.

The alliance is unable to fully help people if landlords and property managers are not willing to accept folks into their housing who may have had challenges in the past, Gil de Gibaja said.

Alachua County is where 92% of homeless people live across all five counties, said John DeCarmine, director at Grace Marketplace.

Alachua County has been conducting the count for 17 years, keeping the methodology and data collection tools the same, which has allowed the county to make generalizations, DeCarmine said.

Conducting surveys in the other four counties is relatively new, so people are still looking to improve the way the surveys are conducted. For example, they hired homeless people to come out with them who have expertise, he said.

“We are still learning,” he said. “In another place like Levy County, you may have a few dozen people, but if there are no services or shelters provided to them, they may be spread out over a big rural area which would make them hard to find in a 24-hour period.”

The city of Gainesville has stopped enforcing its panhandling ordinance in the past couple years, which has led to an explosion of panhandlers on street corners, DeCarmine said.

“Visually, it looks like there are more people out than ever,” he said.

But he said efforts to help the homeless are helping.

“We are doing a better job getting the most vulnerable people off the streets, and we are really starting to see the improvements in how we provide services to these most vulnerable people in our community,” he said.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190411/homeless-count-up-in-region-down-in-county?rssfeed=true,2019-04-11T15:27:04Z,Gainesville Sun,Couple,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
1363,"New SFWMD board members briefed on water system, hint how they might run it differently","CLOSE Here's why that Lake O reservoir is necessary. DACIA JOHNSON/TCPALM Wochit

WEST PALM BEACH — A workshop Wednesday was not only a chance for the all-new members of the South Florida Water Management District board to learn about how water flows through the 18-county district, it was a chance for members to hint at how they'll manage it differently than in the past.

During a discussion of how the Army Corps of Engineers operates Lake Okeechobee, a couple of the experts, brought to teach the new board members, said the Corps' plan to bring the lake lower than normal during the current dry season risks a water shortage if there's a drought during the summer rainy season.

""When you take the lake low at the end of the dry season, and Mother Nature throws a drought your way, you've got to live it,"" said Tom MacVicar, president of MacVicar Consulting, a water management firm that works with the agriculture industry in the Lake Okeechobee and Everglades watersheds.

Not only farmers suffer, MacVicar added, because cities in South Florida rely on the lake as a back-up water supply.

Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch of Sewall's Point, the board member representing Martin and St.Lucie counties, countered that keeping the lake high and the subsequent discharges create ""a health and safety issue for people along the St. Lucie river from the algae blooms. That's why there's a whole new group of us sitting up here today. ... There has to be a new conversation; it's not just about water supply anymore.""

Nobody wants to cut water supply, added board member Cheryl Meads, ""but money versus health is a whole different conversation. ... I'm going to put put the health of people in communities we're responsible for first. I couldn't sleep at night if I didn't.""

Lowering lake

The Army Corps of Engineers plans to take the lake elevation down to between 10 and 11 feet, lower than the usual 12 feet 6 inches, said Lt. Col. Jennifer Reynolds, the deputy commander for South Florida, both to forestall discharges and give grass in the lake, which has been disappearing at a rapid rate because of deep water, a chance to grow back.

Long-term forecasts call for a minimal chance of a drought this summer, Reynolds added.

""Can I guarantee we got it right? No I can't,"" she added.

Also attending — in the audience — was Ronald M. ""Alligator Ron"" Bergeron, who's been tapped by DeSantis to serve on the board but is awaiting a ruling Friday by the Florida Commission on Ethics to see if he can.

'Plumbing' lesson

The South Florida ""plumbing"" system has evolved since the early 1900s; and until late in the 20th century, the emphasis has been on draining acreage and controlling floods so land could be used for farming and residential and commercial development.

""It's only in the last 20 years that our mission has broadened into environmental restoration and Everglades preservation,"" Terrie Bates, the district water resources director, told board members.

Some projects, it turned out, had unintended consequences.

For example: The St. Lucie Canal was built in the early part of the century as part of the Okeechobee Waterway, a shortcut across the Florida peninsula between Stuart and Fort Myers with the lake in the middle.

After Lake O overflowed and killed more than 2,000 people in a 1928 hurricane, the Army Corps of Engineers started using the canal to get rid of excess lake water.

CLOSE Environmentalists and state officials agree there's ""no silver bullet,"" no single project that will seriously curtail discharges of excess Lake Okeechobee water east to the St. Lucie River and west to the Caloosahatchee River. A suite of projects north, south, east and west of the lake are either under construction or in the planning stage to help solve the problem. Wochit

Since then the practice has caused severe environmental damage to the St. Lucie River and southern Indian River Lagoon, including massive toxic algae blooms in the river's estuary.

""The whole system was set up to provide water for agriculture and flood control for the cities,"" said Thurlow-Lippisch. ""People didn't know that they were destroying the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee rivers.""

Fifty years in police work would be sufficient for most law enforcement officers calling it a career. But not for Phil Redstone, who has served as police chief for the town of Orchid since 2005.

Redstone will be retiring this fall from active-duty policing. But he will continue working as a volunteer in the profession he loves.

Redstone plans to volunteer with the detective bureau of the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office, working on cold cases that could be re-examined with the recent advancements in forensic science.

“With my experience, I think I will be able to contribute,” Redstone said. “I’ll be able to give them a couple of days a week, looking at some unsolved crimes.”

We have no doubt Redstone will contribute, greatly, as a volunteer.

1366,... And another thing... | Bill Cotterell,"Don't tread on me (Photo: Nate Beeler/The Columbus Dispatch)

Just sayin’….

If banning plastic straws is so good for the environment, what about plastic cups and lids? They might be re-used, rarely, but when you buy a drink at McDonald’s, the cup and lid contain a lot more plastic than the straw.

And speaking of environmental matters, if grocery stores are so green that they designate parking spaces for hybrid vehicles, why do they hand out thousands of plastic bags every day?

Everybody’s talking about the Mueller report, but it’s probably not going to be a big factor in President Trump’s re-election. People will care more about health care, the economy and Trump’s own popularity.

Why are TV ads for prescription medicines effective? They must work, or there wouldn’t be so many. My doctor tells me what to take, I don’t suggest to him that we try the new, improved Damitol. And advertising must be a huge factor in the overall cost of health care — both in TV spots and those three-page magazine ads, in which two pages are small-type legal disclaimers nobody reads.

You can tell when politicians have run polls on a word or phrase, or tested it with focus groups. The latest is ""returning citizens,"" referring to former prison inmates whose voting rights have been restored. Obviously, Florida Democrats — who have most to gain from registering as many of those 1.4 million felons as possible — have figured out that calling them ""returning citizens"" polls better than ""felons.""

Another word like that is “progressive,"" which sounds nicer than ""liberal."" Hey, who can be against progress? And the Republicans have turned “liberal” into a dirty word. Of course, the media reflexively play along with what liberals wish to be called.

May we please quit calling every conference of two or more government officials or interest groups a ""summit?"" Kennedy-Khruschchev was a summit. Reagan-Gorbachev was a summit. A few city commissioners, college students and business executives having a roundtable on local affairs is a meeting, not a summit.

It’s wonderful that the extraordinarily large field of Democratic candidates for president is not afraid to express bold new ideas. But a couple that deserve to be promptly abandoned are lowering the voting age to 16 and expanding the U.S. Supreme Court by two or three new seats. Also, scrapping the Electoral College is a pretty good idea, but a sure loser at the polls in 2020.

Can we all agree that America does not need another professional football league? The Alliance of American Football recently folded, which didn’t surprise even the few fans who were aware the league had started. Remember the World Football League and the USFL? Do they still have arena football anymore? Some wealthy slow learners will probably try again in a few years, but it seems like the market is sated.

Former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum’s new campaign to register new voters, if successful, will have an impact far beyond its stated goal of defeating President Trump next year. Even if it falls short of its goal, people tend to favor, for most of their lives, the party they first register with. So attracting young people, habitual non-voters and “no party affiliation” registrants is the best — probably only — hope Democrats have for regaining leadership in Florida.

It’s always nice to get a compliment on one of my columns, but I’m often puzzled by readers who have to say how much they hate not only the paper, but the news media everywhere. I’ll get a few reactions, good or bad, to almost every column and I enjoy interacting with readers. But I never know quite how to take the ones that say, “Your column today is a refreshing exception to the simple-minded tripe you guys usually produce.” Uh, thanks… I guess.

I will never understand the appeal of term limits. Has the quality of legislation improved since 2000, when the “Eight is Enough” constitutional amendment took effect in the Legislature? If you think legislators get too cozy with the lobbyists and overly dependent on special interests if they stay up here too long, that happens long before most of them even win their first races.

This year, there’s been a proposal to limit school board members to eight years in office. Why? If somebody is not doing a good job, vote them out after two or four years — as soon as possible. If we get good, dedicated officeholders, why should we have to give them up just because a certain length of time has passed?

1367,How Reba McEntire found love following a tough divorce,"Advertisement How Reba McEntire found love following a tough divorce Reba, Anthony 'Skeeter' Lasuzzo have been going strong for years now Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Reba McEntire was in a difficult place following her divorce from television producer Narvel Blackstock in 2015. The two had been married for 26 years and share a son, Shelby Blackstock. Though it wasn’t easy for the country superstar to move on, she relied on her music and faith to get her through. After that tough time, the ""Fancy"" singer has finally found love again. Reba met boyfriend, Anthony Lasuzzo, who goes by Skeeter, in 2017 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, after they were introduced by their friends, Kix and Barbara Brooks. Kix, of course, is one half of the band Brooks & Dunn.“ 'We’ve got a friend who is a wildlife photographer, and he knows all the good places to go and he’ll drive you around,'” Reba told CountryLiving.com. “And so he did, and we started dating about a month or two after that.” The pair’s sweet romance is well-documented on social media, where Reba often shares photos of the couple celebrating Valentine’s Day, hanging out with friends and enjoying their many vacations. “Last year, we were in Africa, Italy and Iceland,” she said. “We want to go to New Zealand.” Though they live a mostly laid-back lifestyle, they also find plenty of opportunities to jazz it up a bit. In December, Skeeter, Reba and Shelby attended the State Department dinner in Washington, D.C. ahead of her being honored at the Kennedy Center Honors. In December, she performed at the funeral of her ""dear friend,"" George H.W. Bush, alongside the Oak Ridge Boys, which she said was an ""honor and a privilege.""Making time for their relationship seems like it’d be a tricky feat, as Reba’s been one busy lady this year. Her new album, ""Stronger Than the Truth,"" released April 5, and she says her latest collection is “more like the songs she grew up with.”“I grew up singing in dance halls, rodeos, where people danced a lot,” she said. “So these are songs that you can dance to. It’s more back to my roots.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/reba-mcentire-boyfriend-skeeter-anthony-lasuzzo/27102943,2019-04-10T19:28:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
1368,Ex-Navarre Beach Chamber CEO sentenced to five years in prison for defrauding elderly woman,"Judy Morehead (Photo: Special to the News Journal)

Judy Morehead, the former CEO of the Navarre Beach Chamber of Commerce, was sentenced Wednesday to five years in prison for her role in defrauding an elderly woman and another couple out of $300,000 to pay her own personal debts.

She was also ordered to pay $250,000 in restitution, according to the Alabama Securities Commission.

Alabama Circuit Court Judge Larry Anderson handed down the sentence Wednesday in Henry County Circuit Court, nearly two months after Morehead pleaded guilty to securities fraud for engaging in an act, practice or course of business which operated as a fraud or deceit upon investors.

Morehead is out on bond and has filed an appeal.

A grand jury in March 2017 indicted Morehead, her husband Stanley and her son Benjamin after hearing testimony from victims that Morehead orchestrated more than $300,000 in fraud and used the funds to pay her own personal debts, according to a press release form the Alabama Securities Commission.

In one instance, Morehead acted as a financial adviser to an 84-year-old woman with dementia who was slated to receive $250,000 from her late sister, which she had intended to leave to charity, according to the release.

Instead, Morehead convinced the woman to name her husband, Stanley, as the trustee of the trust and Morehead herself as the alternate trustee. Morehead then funneled the $250,000 trust funds to pay her own mortgage loans and debts, never telling the elderly woman what she was really using the money for.

In a second instance, a husband and wife team invested $59,000 with Morehead's family-owned company, Southern Investment Group Inc. for the purpose of flipping houses. But instead of using the money to invest in real estate, Morehead again paid off her own personal expenses, according to authorities.

Morehead was scheduled to go to trial Feb. 11, but instead pleaded guilty. She faced up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $20,000.

Morehead served as the head of the Navarre Beach Chamber from October 2015 until her resignation in June 2017. She resigned citing ""family responsibilities,"" and her indictment came to light just days later.

1369,Whiskey Beach Pub moving into The Cove's former home on State Road A1A in Satellite Beach,"CLOSE Whiskey Beach Pub opened in March 2015 in a small retail plaza at 1132 State Road A1A, two blocks south of the Publix-anchored Atlantic Plaza. Rick Neale and Tim Shortt, Wochit

Whiskey Beach Pub is moving southward down State Road A1A into the former home of The Cove — a shuttered Satellite Beach landmark.

Construction crews are demolishing portions of The Cove's old building at 1462 SR A1A, just north of Pelican Beach Park — and they will soon add a large outdoor tiki bar. Whiskey Beach Pub owners Jerry and Judi Hiebert hope to reopen sometime this summer in the larger venue.

""Oh, people are so excited. Everybody that grew up around here knows about the place. It has a huge history from way, way back,"" Judi Hiebert said of The Cove.

""Even the people in their 30s, they used to go in their 20s over there and watch the older people dance and party,"" Hiebert said.

""People are coming to check us out who have never been here, because they know about that place,"" she said.

Jerry Hiebert said he bought The Cove's old home last month for more than $1 million — ""about right for a property an acre and a quarter across the street from the beach.""

The couple plans to retain the Whiskey Beach Pub theme: whiskey bar inside, tiki bar outside. They plan to partner with a restaurateur to manage the new venue's kitchen, and they will book larger-scale musical acts on the larger stage.

The Skyline Restaurant debuted in 1957 at 1462 SR A1A, when the latter was a two-lane street. That October, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I into orbit, triggering the Space Race and the birth of NASA in 1958.

The building later housed Surf & Turf and Land and Sea Restaurant before Lou Apuzzo took over and renamed it The Cove in 1987. The Cove became a longtime beachside hangout, featuring an outdoor deck, tiki bar, dance club with live music, and dining room.

The business closed in 2011, and Neptune Bar and Grill replaced it for a six-year run. Then the building reopened in October 2017 as Satellite Breeze, a short-lived Greek restaurant that shut down last year.

Whiskey Beach Pub opened in March 2015 in a small retail plaza at 1132 SR A1A, two blocks south of the Publix-anchored Atlantic Plaza. The Satellite Beach watering hole was recently Declan’s Irish Pub and Thirsty Lizard — and years back, it was Lottery Lounge.

Workers discovered a Coke bottle dating to 1957 inside an exterior wall while remodeling The Cove's old building, Jerry Hiebert said.

""We're concentrating on the outdoor area, which everybody likes. We're doing a really, really big tiki bar out on A1A. That’s the main portion of the renovation, even though we're updating the interior and updating the electrical and the plumbing, and everything about it, he said.

1370,Former Navarre Beach chamber CEO sentenced on securities fraud,"ABBEVILLE, Alabama — Judy Morehead, former president and CEO of the Navarre Beach Area Chamber of Commerce, has been sentenced to five years in prison after she pleaded guilty in February to a single felony count of securities fraud in Alabama's 20th Judicial Circuit Court.

Morehead has applied for probation, with a hearing set for sometime in the next several weeks, according to her attorney, Dustin Fowler. At that hearing, all or part Morehead's sentence handed down Wednesday could be transferred to probation, Fowler said.

Morehead's sentencing came as part of a plea agreement in which other charges against her were dropped, according to Fowler. In addition, Fowler said the plea agreement included dropping of all charges against her husband, Stanley Morehead, and her son, Benjamin Morehead.

According to the Alabama Securities Commission, the three were indicted by a Henry County, Alabama, grand jury in March 2017 ""for accepting approximately $300,000 of investors' funds and then knowingly using the funds to pay personal debts, personal loans, and expenses unrelated to investments."" Specifically, Judy Morehead was indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, two counts of securities fraud, an additional fraud charge, and one count of sale of securities by an unregistered agent.

Morehead resigned from the Navarre Beach Area Chamber of Commerce in June 2017, about a month after turning herself in to Alabama authorities and being released from the Henry County Jail on $40,000 bond. She had been president and CEO of the Navarre Beach Area Chamber of Commerce for almost two years prior to her resignation.

According to a news release from Alabama Securities Commission, Judy Morehead told an 84-year-old woman that the woman's $250,000 trust funds ""had been invested in arms-length commercial transactions,"" while in reality ""Judy Morehead orchestrated the use of the $250,000 trust funds to pay Judy Morehead's personal mortgage loans and debts.""

Also according to the commission, Morehead used money from a couple who believed they were investing in real estate to pay personal expenses, although she repaid the money after indictments were issued in the case.

1372,"Ringland, Hertz work together to plant more than 100 trees, bushes at Lakes Park","CLOSE Trees planted at Lakes Park by Hertz employees in celebration of Earth Month Andrew West, News-Press

Russ Ringland was just looking for an excuse to plant trees.

So he was quick to field a call from Hertz, which had dozens of volunteers who wanted to participate in some type of environmental program this month before Earth Day.

Ringland talked with managers at a Lee County park and found a quarter-acre of land at Lakes Park that could use some plantings.

""It's going to create habitat, especially for the birds,"" said Ringland, with Ringland Construction. ""It will take a few years, but there will be wading birds because it will hold a little bit of water. And hopefully in 30 years the canopy will be 40 or 50 feet tall.""

The site is just north of the Children's Garden, a massive plot of exotic trees, colorful flowers and kept walkways along Gladiolus Drive.

More than 100 trees and bushes were planted Friday, Ringland said.

""We filled it in with a lot of mulch because it keeps the water in and the mowers out,"" Ringland said. ""The biggest danger to the small trees is mowing crews. And the mulch keeps the grasses and weeds out.""

""We had a couple of weeks notice to get the site ready, mostly to get a pump out there,"" Flanjack said. ""The cypress we know are going to work very well there. And the red maple is another good variety and we have swamp bay, which will grow very well in that wet retention area.""

""(These) projects are part of our first company-wide month of service centered on the environment which is an important focus area for us.

1373,Saying goodbye to Florida State's transcendent senior class | Wayne McGahee III,"ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Where would Florida State basketball be if not for Terance Mann? Or Phil Cofer? Or Christ Koumadje?

Three seniors that arrived at FSU when the program was at a low point. Three players that have been instrumental in the Seminoles' rise to a program that regularly makes it deep in the NCAA tournament.

Three seniors that have now played their last game in a FSU uniform with the Seminoles' 72-58 loss to Gonzaga in the Sweet 16 Thursday.

""I grew up dreaming of playing college basketball, trying to make a difference wherever I go, and I feel like I did that here,"" Mann said.

""Coming to Florida State, me and my class, that was our goal in 2015. Just to make a difference, make an impact, and change the culture of this program. I think we did a great job of that.""

No player has had a bigger impact on the FSU program than Mann over the past decade.

He was a highly ranked player, and in any class over the previous five years, he would have been the superstar. But he came in with Dwayne Bacon and Malik Beasley, who are now playing in the NBA.

No disrespect to those excellent basketball players -- they played a large role in getting FSU to where it is today -- but Mann has meant more to the program than both of them combined.

He broke the record for most games played in program history (140) Thursday night.

But it's not the number of games he played in that made him so invaluable. It's the way he played the game and the way he handled himself both on and off the court.

Mann has been a true team player since he arrived. He filled whatever role was asked of him and did it with a smile on his face. He was a passer, a rebounder, a scorer, but, most importantly, he was a leader.

He never shirked the tough questions following a loss and was quick to point out how well his teammates played when he put the 'Noles on his back in games.

He was tough and put it all on the line for his teammates every time he was out on the court. His play during the 2018 NCAA tournament with a torn groin muscle and a torn abdominal muscle is the perfect example. He still scored 18 points in the Sweet 16 win over Gonzaga despite the considerable pain he was in.

Cofer didn't come in with Mann, but in the class the year before with the 2014 class.

He was on the first team I covered when I joined the FSU beat, and his freshman season, he was one of my favorite players to watch.

Cofer would pick up the garbage around the basket and played with such high energy that it raised the energy level of his teammates when he was on the court.

His sophomore season was cut short due to injury and his junior season saw him limited by that same injury, as well as a change in the way he was asked to play the game.

FSU needed a player that could stretch the floor from the forward position. After watching him attempt outside shots as a freshman, I'll admit I was skeptical that the move would work.

That's why the FSU coaching staff gets paid the big bucks, while I write about them from the baseline.

But it wouldn't have worked if Cofer didn't have the drive and determination to spend hour after hour in the gym taking shots. He did it with a walking boot on his foot while he was injured, and kept it up until he was a proficient perimeter shooter.

Cofer was special during the 2017-18 season as he helped lead the Seminoles to the Elite Eight. He did everything asked of him and never complained. He was a leader and everyone on the team looked up to him.

His final season at FSU was riddled with injuries and sorrow. He suffered another foot injury and it plagued him all season long.

Cofer didn't get a chance to play in the 2019 NCAA Tournament because of a foot injury and the loss of his father to an incurable disease that he'd been fighting since 2007. He didn't even make the trip to Anaheim for the Sweet 16.

But he was there.

""Phil's our guy,"" Mann said.

""He's a captain. Not having him today hurt us. We just try to feel his presence. Feel that he's there""

FSU left an open spot for him in the line during the national anthem and left open his seat on the bench.

That his teammates and coaches cared for him enough to do that tells you everything you need to know about the character that he possesses and the type of person that he is.

Koumadje didn't really emerge until his final couple years in the program, but he became a key piece to FSU's puzzle over his two seasons.

After FSU's second round win over Murray State Saturday, Koumadje was quick to point out that I said that the Seminoles can't run the offense through him during the Elite Eight game against Michigan a year ago.

I'll own that. And I'll admit when I'm wrong.

He proved multiple times this season that he was capable of taking over a game. If he hadn't been in foul trouble for almost the entire game against Gonzaga Thursday, he may have done it once again.

He was a true rim protector for the Seminoles and turned into a solid basketball player during the final year of his career.

Those three players aren't the only seniors worth celebrating though.

Guard P.J. Savoy took the JUCO route to get to FSU, but his impact on the program has been felt.

Savoy came to FSU as a three-point specialist and knocked down so many big shots over his three-year career it's hard to name them all.

""It meant everything to me,"" Savoy said. ""It was a dream for me to play Division I basketball. Florida State found me and it's been a dream.""

His three-point shot with a minute left to give the Seminoles the lead against No. 1 seed Xavier last season sent FSU to the Sweet 16 for the first time in six years.

He came to FSU as a defensive liability, and that's why he didn't play more during his first season.

But he worked his tail off during the off-season to get better. Savoy never became an excellent defender during his time at FSU, but the effort was there on both ends of the court.

Guard David Nichols was at FSU just one year after transferring in from Albany, and it didn't end the way it hoped for him.

Nichols was sidelined with an injury he suffered against Vermont in the opening round of the 2019 NCAA tournament and missed the final two games of his career.

""I hate to see it for David and Phil,"" Hamilton said.

""David came because he wanted to participate in the NCAA Tournament like this... My heart goes out to those two guys, who didn't have an opportunity.""

But he was a big part of FSU's success this season.

Nichols’ doggedness on both ends of the court in the back-up point guard role provided relief for a banged up Trent Forrest.

He also had a penchant for hitting big shots when the Seminoles needed them this season. He led FSU to victory over Virginia in the ACC tournament with 14 points and had 16 points in the loss to North Carolina.

His tenacity and attitude provided a nice balance for a FSU team with so many nice guys.

This senior class -- all five of them -- have helped change the FSU program.

It wasn't in shambles when Cofer, Mann, and Koumadje arrived. The Seminoles were a decent basketball program that was fighting to make the NCAA Tournament.

But what it is now is night-and-day different from then.

FSU set the record for wins in a season (29) and ACC regular season wins (13) this season. The Seminoles have a 6-3 record in the NCAA Tournament over the past three years.

It's the second time in program history that FSU has made back-to-back Sweet 16's.

""Looking back, it's something that we're all going to be proud of,"" Koumadje said.

""The guys, the chemistry that we have now is going to be forever. Coming back, the legacy that this team has is going to last forever.""

This is a FSU program that's been one of the best teams in the ACC over that span. This is a FSU program that has found success at the pinnacle of the sport in the NCAA Tournament.

And some of the biggest reasons why that's the case took their FSU uniforms off for the final time Thursday.

It's time to celebrate them and what they accomplished for the Seminoles.

1374,Sheriff may move to get Leon off 'anarchy cities' list tied to Florida sanctuary city debate,"CLOSE There is great debate over “sanctuary cities.' The term is actually a bit of a misnomer which makes quantifying the amount of sanctuary jurisdictions difficult. Wochit

The Leon County Sheriff's Office will take a second look at a policy that placed Tallahassee among a hard-line immigration reform group’s list of “anarchy cities.”

Sen. Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, worked with the Federation for American Immigration Reform and Floridians for Immigration Enforcement on an anti-sanctuary city bill working its way through the Legislature.

Those two groups have compiled lists of Florida cities and counties they say have weak federal immigration detainer policies — that is, they don’t hold undocumented immigrants for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Leon County is among the 30 counties tagged by FAIR for policies they say ""disobey the law"" when it comes to the arrest of illegal immigrants. A 2014 directive from LCSO Major Robert Long declared that it “may be unconstitutional” to detain an individual based solely on an ICE request.

That’s because, immigration, as Leon County Commissioner Bryan Desloge found, falls in a blurry area that is somewhere between criminal and civil violations.

A criminal act, such as driving under the influence, is prohibited conduct punished as a crime. A burned-out headlight, meanwhile, is viewed as a rules violation and treated as a civil matter with a fine.

“If somebody breaks the law they are going to be arrested and held in jail,” said Desloge, a Republican who is ""seriously considering"" a run for Senator Bill Montford's Senate seat in 2020. “But it is my understanding that being an illegal immigrant does not rise to the level of crime to be held in jail. We don’t have a right to hold them.”

For the past five years, whenever an inmate with questionable documentation was about to be released the LCSO notified ICE. LCSO spokesman David Teems said each time ICE agents arrived in time to take the individual into custody.

“We are not going to hold someone on a civil order,” said Teems. “But we have not had an issue. They’ve always been here to pick them up.”

But Teems said the policy is under review because of an agreement ICE reached in January with 17 Florida sheriff departments.

The basic ordering agreement, according to the Florida Sheriffs Association, clarifies that suspected aliens are held under the color of federal authority, thereby protecting local law enforcement agencies from potential liability.

The liability comes in the constitutional issues highlighted by both Desloge and Long.

“ICE would pay for a couple of days to hold on to them,” said Teems. “It’s being reviewed by our legal staff.”

He could not say how long LCSO will take to review the ICE agreement.

Proposals to outlaw sanctuary cities have the backing of Gov. Ron DeSantis and have cleared committees in both the House and Senate. Gruters’ bill has passed two committees on party line votes — it orders local enforcement to comply with a detainer request.

The House proposal has been placed on a fast track and is one stop from the floor. It would require local governments to repeal any sanctuary city policy within 90 days or face up to a $5,000 a day fine.

“Obviously if the law changes we will do what the law requires,” said Teems about the maneuvering at the state house.

The News Service of Florida reported earlier this week that Floridians for Immigration Enforcement, which wants to “defeat immigration anarchy” in Florida, influenced the drafting of the Senate proposal.

Gruters’ office worked with David Caulkett, the organization’s vice president who also serves as a Florida adviser for FAIR.

The Southern Poverty Law Center website categorizes the Center for Immigration Studies and FAIR as a “hate groups” because John Tanton, who helped form the groups, has “expressed his wish that America remains a majority-white population: a goal to be achieved, presumably, by limiting the number of non-whites who enter the country.”

Pushing back against that “hate group” label, the Center for Immigration Studies filed a lawsuit in January, arguing the organization has been damaged by the “conspiracy to falsely call it a hate group,” court records show. Caulkett told the News Service that the Southern Poverty Law Center is a “scumbag organization” and that it’s “laughable” to be labeled a hate group.

Gruters downplays the groups' role in advancing the legislation and said SB 168 is a ""softer"" version of last year's House bill — a measure former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum denounced in an early 2018 televised debate with former House Speaker Richard Corcoran.

Despite Gruters reworking the bill, Gillum took to Twitter Wednesday to urge voters to rally against it.

""Republicans are trying to pass a bill in Florida to separate hardworking immigrant families — straight out of the Trump playbook,"" tweeted Gillum, last year's Democratic nominee for governor. ""Floridians, tell your lawmakers to reject SB 168,""

1383,"Many happy returns: The artist as gallerist; three painters, 30 works each that circle back","When the late Peg Longstreth joined a handful of art studios to champion contemporary art in North Naples, the color-drenched, looping works of Kosmas Ballis were a familiar sight inside her lofted gallery.

Ten years later, that five-studio outpost of art has developed into a 60-member arts district. The Longstreth gallery is gone. But Ballis is back, this time as a gallery owner rather than the artist and close to the city's center.

""I've always liked Naples,"" he said, wandering through KAJ, the gallery he and partner Jason Taylor, a Los Angeles-based plastic surgeon, opened at 462 U.S. 41 N. in November. ""So when we were talking about a place that appreciated this kind of art, Naples naturally came to mind.""

Two different Naples art galleries are exemplifying a sort of everything old is new vibe: the United Arts Council trusted three artists to take a single item and approach it 30 times, trying at least several different methods on it; and a new gallery has opened with a co-owner who was known here as an artist about 10 years ago, Kosmas Ballis. At the United Arts Council, three artists took a challenge to do 30 pieces of the same subject, and it was surprising how far afield they went from the original drawing -- but then came back to close to the original piece. In the KAJ Gallery, has some huge pieces by Paul Tamanian, working mostly with mixed media on aluminum, and Chris Gustin, working mostly with Stoneware that has been Anagama wood-fired or gas-fired, as well as a few other artists. On display as well, Kosmas asked artists to paint giant masks, where each mask turned out different. (Photo: Andrea Melendez/The News-Press/USA TODAY NETOWORK - FLORIDA)

He laughed recalling the day that proved his point: A baby blue Bentley convertible made a hard turn and screeched into the parking lot; a woman jumped out and ran in.

""That's Paul Tamanian! I love his work!"" she declared to a startled Ballis. Ballis couldn't agree more: ""I think Tamanian is the Jackson Pollock of our time,"" he said.

Tamanian's abstract colors, done on aluminum to give them richness and depth, are certainly there. So are the ceramics of Chris Gustin, from welted platters washed in earth tones to stoneware figures and teabowls with hand-sized indentations. Karen Shapiro's whimsical pieces re-create vintage containers — Lava Soap boxes, Indian Head brake fluid, Morton salt boxes — also in ceramics.

""My mission is to present the finest in contemporary art by the most exciting artists working today,"" he said. ""And going into ceramics, which is my passion, one of my goals is to bring more exposure to ceramics. Most people associate high art with two-dimensional or bronze art. It's my hope to change that belief.""

(Photo: Andrea Melendez/The News-Press/USA TODAY NETOWORK - FLORIDA)

Ballis actually does have a bit of his own work, ABS facial features that he has trademarked as Kosmasks and has invited artists to paint. ""I was amazed at the care and the creativity in what came back to me,"" said Ballis, who originated the idea for an exhibition in the Atlanta Merchandise Mart.

Some of his own works may come to KAJ. After a 2016 Taiwan Ceramics Biennale that funded studies in Asia and a 2017 McKnight Fellowship in Minnesota, Ballis is still creating art in a studio close to his Fort Myers home.

But he wants KAJ to be seen as an art gallery, not an artist's gallery.

""Eventually, summer may time of filtering some of it in. I want to keep it flowing,"" he said of the gallery's commitment to a small number of artists at a time. ""I don't want it to be a curiosity shop.""

'Look and look again'

The wheel spins back to its starting spot, and that circular return may be strong in our psyche, too. When three local artists set out to paint a given subject 30 times, the subject, grew, changed and even nearly disappeared — and, then, in the end, returned to close to its beginnings.

""Look and Look Again,"" showing now at the United Arts Council of Collier County, resulted from a challenge among three friends in the Southwest Florida Pastel Society. It wasn't done for a exhibition, said Tanya Trinkaus Glass, who proposed the challenge.

""We've known each other for a few years and we've gotten together a couple of times a year. Whenever we do, we've given ourselves a singular challenge for the next time together,"" she said. ""One time it was to paint in the style of an artist we admired, a Van Gogh or someone like that.""

The 30-painting concept came from an art class challenge Glass had been through with a Providence (Rhode Island) art instructor who suggested her students paint 100 paintings of the same subject. Glass had been able to do 30.

She recalls her friends weren't excited about the workload when she proposed it last spring: ""But they said, 'OK. We've got the summer.'""

What materialized in September were surprising pastels done in different techniques, different sizes, new colors and on different media. The results also caught the eye of the United Arts Council, which asked to show the works of all three: Glass, Gerry Crow Roeder and Lynne Wilcox.

Roeder, who teaches pastels, took the opportunity to try different brands of oil pastels, which she said work better with older students and young children because they eliminate pastel dust. She also tried different fixatives to keep the finished product permanent. And she began to expand her own style.

""I'll definitely use more of the brighter colors now,"" she said. Roeder had chosen water lilies as her subject, one that, intentional or not, conjures up the iconic Monet paintings. But as she worked, the results began to change.

""I think I went from Monet to me,"" she said.

Wilcox tackled several innovations at once, re-creating the pear she had chosen for her subject in a black-and-white bull's-eye form and cutting it into a collage on a red background. Wilcox concluded her 30 with a return to her lighter pastel rendering, with a sense of humor; the original pear is shown with a bite out of it.

""Since this whole experiment was way out of my comfort zone of painting, I decided that I don't need to be afraid any more,"" Wilcox said. ""I don't need to be afraid to experiment, and I can get out of my comfort zone and like the results.""

The whole ""challenge of 30"" was exciting for her, she said.

Glass also found herself stretching artistically: ""When you do that many, it forces you to use more colors than you normally use. It forces you to use the medium differently.""

1385,WikiLeaks founder unlikely to be extradited to US soon,"<p>The battle between WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the American government was always going to be epic, involving concepts like free speech, journalists' rights, national interests, even treason.</p><p>As Assange settles in to his first night in British custody, his allies and enemies alike are gearing up for what promises to be a long, dogged legal slog, not only over his possible extradition to the U.S. but over how U.S. courts should view his actions, which sharply cleave public opinion.</p><p>Yet in a way, Assange has been fighting this battle for much of the past decade. The struggle has taken him through a ""mansion arrest"" in the English countryside; a dramatic escape into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London; a multimillion-pound U.K. police siege of the embassy that has strained government coffers; and even a bizarre attempt to turn him into a Moscow-based diplomat.</p><p>Whatever happens now, one thing is clear: Assange, who was dragged out of the embassy and arrested Thursday by British police after Ecuador withdrew his political asylum, is not going anywhere soon. Extradition to the United States could take years more.</p><p>Assange's saga kicked off in November 2010, when his publication of 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables that month left American officialdom apoplectic. Joe Biden, then-U.S. vice president, compared Assange to a ""high-tech terrorist."" Sarah Palin, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, called for him to be hunted down by U.S. troops like an al-Qaida operative.</p><p>Tempers at the top eventually cooled -- Palin would later apologize to Assange after he began publishing material about U.S. Democrats. As a candidate, President Donald Trump startled many Americans by repeatedly praising WikiLeaks.</p><p>But in the U.S. intelligence community, the rage against Assange lingered. On the sidelines of a conference a few years ago, a former senior National Security Agency official told an Associated Press journalist that all he wanted was a couple of minutes alone with Assange in a dark alley, grasping his hands together as if he were crushing a man's windpipe.</p><p>Assange seemed to sense that the release of the diplomatic cables, which also enraged and embarrassed other countries around the world, were the point of no return.</p><p></p><p>It's often forgotten that Assange once traveled easily to the United States, appearing at the National Press Club in Washington on April 2010 to present ""Collateral Murder,"" the title he chose for the camera footage that captured American helicopter pilots laughing as they fired at a crowd of civilians they mistook for Iraqi insurgents.</p><p>Shortly after his visit, his source for the video -- an American Army intelligence analyst now named Chelsea Manning -- would be arrested after an ill-advised online confession. Assange dropped out of sight, likely aware that the government now had spools of conversations between him and Manning, including the one that now forms the centerpiece of the Justice Department's newly unveiled indictment against Assange for conspiracy to hack into a U.S. government computer.</p><p>For a while, Assange gravitated to the Frontline Club in London, the convivial journalists' hangout where he dropped one media bombshell after another in collaboration with the Guardian newspaper and other media outlets. But staying in Britain, a close ally of the United States, was risky.</p><p>In a fateful move, Assange decided to scope out Sweden, a country with powerful press protections and where he had already located some of WikiLeaks' servers. The expedition would prove to be a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Two women he stayed with there would soon go to the police with allegations of sexual assault and rape. The prosecution nearly tore WikiLeaks apart and threated the upcoming publication the U.S. diplomatic cables.</p><p>With Sweden out of the question and ""Cablegate"" sure to enrage the Americans further, Assange looked to Moscow. A document published by the AP last year showed he considered the idea of getting a Russian visa through his friend and sometimes WikiLeaks collaborator, Israel Shamir.</p><p>Assange would eventually get the visa, Shamir said later, but it came several weeks too late. Sweden had already applied for an Interpol Red Notice, something akin to an international arrest warrant, making travel all but impossible. That left Assange little choice but to turn himself in on Dec. 7, 2010, to British authorities.</p><p>Things only got more surreal from there.</p><p>Assange was granted bail at the country mansion of Frontline's founder, Vaughan Smith, receiving a stream of well-heeled and rebellious visitors in rural Norfolk while his London legal battle against extradition went all the way to Britain's Supreme Court. When that court finally turned him down, Assange dyed his hair, popped in colored contacts and skipped bail, fleeing to the Ecuadorian Embassy.</p><p>From there, he carried on as before, albeit in a more constricted space. When the AP visited him in 2012, he occupied a back room in the embassy scattered with laptops, some marked ""Do not connect to the internet."" When discussing an upcoming leak, Assange took a reporter into the corridor between his office and the bathroom, speaking in a whisper in a bid to baffle the high-tech surveillance thought to be deployed against him.</p><p>The embassy stalemate dragged on for years, costing the British government millions in policing costs.</p><p>But it didn't stop Assange from publishing new material, notably in 2016, when his disclosure of U.S. Democratic Party documents stolen by Russian hackers hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential election campaign.</p><p>But if Assange had hoped for leniency from America's new president, he would soon be disappointed. Twitter messages between WikiLeaks and Trump's eldest son, Donald Jr., showed the group lobbying him to get his father to suggest that Australia appoint its native son Assange to be its ambassador to the U.S.</p><p>Instead, the Trump administration promoted him to public enemy; in a 2017 speech, then-CIA director Mike Pompeo described WikiLeaks as a ""hostile non-state intelligence agency.""</p><p>Meanwhile, Assange wasn't getting much more satisfaction from his Latin American host, which was increasingly embarrassed by its houseguest's publications. The government of Ecuador tried all kinds of creative solutions to break the embassy impasse, including an abortive attempt to send Assange to Russia under diplomatic cover. When it became clear that the WikiLeaks founder wasn't leaving -- and that he wouldn't curb his publications to suit Ecuador's diplomatic interests -- the government looked for a way to wash its hands of him.</p><p>Tensions had been building for more than a year, but the Thursday morning raid in London was still a surprise. WikiLeaks had issued one of its periodic warnings that Assange was at risk, but at a Wednesday press conference, his longtime lieutenant, Kristinn Hrafnsson, told journalists that Assange's eviction from the embassy had been averted.</p><p>It's not clear what comes next, but it will almost certainly be complicated.</p><p>The interactions quoted in the U.S. indictment are nothing new -- Assange's instant message exchange with Manning has been in the public domain ever since the latter's court-martial -- so Assange's high-powered legal team has had years to prepare their arguments. And Britain has generally tended to favor accused hackers fighting extradition to America.</p><p>Lauri Love, a friend of Assange's who was accused of penetrating U.S. government networks, was last year spared extradition after Britain's high court ruled in his favor. British hacker Gary McKinnon, accused of breaking into U.S. military and space networks, won his fight against extradition in 2012 after a decade-long struggle.</p><p>Assange's fight may not take a decade, but he's unlikely to see the inside of a U.S. courtroom anytime soon.</p>",https://www.local10.com/lifestyle/legal-news/wikileaks-founder-unlikely-to-be-extradited-to-us-soon,2019-04-12T04:03:05Z,WPLG,Couple,"3401 W Hallandale Beach Blvd, Pembroke Park, FL 33023, USA",FL,33023

""It's motivation,"" Roe said. ""You got so close and may have one time thinking that you maybe had it. It's something that you want to get to and finish that goal that we started last year, but this is a brand new year, a new team.

""You don't want to think about that right now. It's an exciting time of the year. The fans are going to be excited. We're going to be excited.""

It's the playoffs, so everything goes to another level.

""There's no better time than playoff hockey,"" Ralph said. ""It's the most intense, the most physical you're going to watch all year long. The players are pouring their heart and soul into every shift.""

""Just keep it simple,"" Roe said. ""You don't want to overcomplicate things. Playoffs comes down to the little plays against your opponent.""

Florida didn't retain the Brabham Cup with the ECHL's highest point total this season, but the Blades finished second, won their conference, easily won their division, and won at least 50 games for the second straight year under Ralph, who had 46 in his first season.

""He's definitely an emotional coach,"" Roe said. ""He's going to make sure he gets what he wants out of us. I think that's something I respect and all of the players in the room respect. Him and (associate coach) Tad (O'Had) have done a great job. It's a very positive environment and they want the best for us. That's something he makes clear right away.""

It's minor league hockey, so many of the faces change every year. This postseason, there will be a lot of fresh ones. A total of six rookies, led by goaltender Jeremy Helvig, are on the roster.

Partly with that youth in mind, Ralph has been having his team watch something to get ready for the playoffs. But it's not last year's Game 7. It's way older. They've been watching a program called ""Names on the Cup"" where some of the biggest names from some of the most successful teams in NHL history look back.

""The last three weeks we've been watching it a little bit at a time, but really trying to glean these experiences from NHL teams of the past and what they've gone through,"" Ralph said. ""I think the players have enjoyed it. Nonetheless, it's a learning experience. In today's hockey world, you don't really have the opportunity to keep your team together at any level of hockey anymore.

""I think it is important that we can learn from the past, and even if we physically haven't gone through it ourselves, we take a lot from the Montreal Canadiens, the Philadelphia Flyers, the New York Islanders, and the Edmonton Oilers. It was a few decades ago now, but it's still very relevant in today's game, the modern game.""

The combination of a winning culture the Blades have built in their 21 seasons — missing the playoffs just once — and advancing to the Kelly Cup Finals four times, albeit winning it all just once, back in 2012, registers with those who haven't put on the alligator sweater much.

Roe, a Fort Myers native, led the ECHL in plus-minus last season. This year, the Blades also had the plus-minus leader, forward Joe Cox (46), who also was a big plus offensively with a team-high 61 points (27 goals, 34 assists). On Tuesday, captain John McCarron was returned from Stockton of the AHL after spending over a month there. He's still fourth on the Blades with 53 points (26 goals, 27 assists).

""Everything is starting to come together,"" Ralph said. ""Our players, they're getting healthy; they're coming back from the AHL. It was pretty exciting seeing them all practice for the time (Monday) and really start gelling together.""

While Cox and McCarron are holdovers from last season, the rest of the Blades top offensive players aren't. Rookie Blake Winiecki is second with 59 points, and newcomer Kyle Platzer is third with 57. Mike Neville, another rookie, is fifth with 35.

Besides Roe, Cox and McCarron, forwards Sam Warning, Steven Lorentz, defenseman Derek Sheppard, and goaltender Callum Booth are somewhere on this year's playoff roster and played in the postseason a year ago.

However, Lorentz has been with Charlotte of the AHL the past month, and Sheppard, who made the ECHL All-Rookie Team, was called up last week. Booth has been injured. Warning returned late in the regular season after missing 66 games with an injury.

In addition to Warning, forward Justin Auger also returned late in the regular season after a lengthy absence, and one of those rookies, Alex Tonge, who was just signed March 26, provided a huge offensive boost with five goals and three assists in five games after finishing his college career at Robert Morris.

But this is the playoffs, which means goaltenders more often than not take center stage, and Helvig, a 6-foot-4, 210-pounder, is ready for his close up.

Helvig won 27 games this season, tying the franchise rookie record shared by Anthony Peters (2015-16) and David Leggio (2008-09). He also had a 2.27 goals-against average and a .918 save percentage.

""He's got such great poise and confidence in his game,"" Ralph said. ""He's been on some long runs in junior hockey so we're confident that he's going to just continue to be himself.""

And being himself is being a top prospect.

""Quietly, he's very competitive,"" Ralph said. ""I talked about his poise and confidence under pressure. Obviously his athletic ability is off the charts. I think when you combine those three things, it's a pretty good package.""

""It's been fun watching him just kind of becoming the player he is now,"" Roe said. ""He's never really rattled too much on the ice during games. You know what you're going to get from him.""

Helvig believes he's ready to keep giving what Roe referred to.

""It's a new season,"" Helvig said. ""You have to try to forget what happened during the regular season. We've worked hard these past couple of days.

""It's going to be my first time pro in the playoffs, so it's going to be exciting.""

1391,State builds case against Michael Haim,"Michael Haim's trial in the slaying of his wife, Bonnie, in 1993, began Monday with jury selection.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The biological son of a man on trial for killing his wife in 1993 told the court he had no recollection of what happened to his mother when he was 3½ years old, but he was emotionally shaken when he dug up her skull 21 years later.

""I picked up the coconut object and it ended up being the top portion of her skull,"" Aaron Fraser testified Tuesday. ""I had it in my hand. .... Looked back in the hole and you could see teeth. At that point in time, you could see the top portion of her eye sockets.""

UNCUT: Aaron Fraser's testimony on finding remains

WATCH: Gavel-to-gavel coverage of Michael Haim trial

Michael Haim, now 52, is accused of second-degree murder in the death of 23-year-old Bonnie Haim, who went missing while the couple was having marital problems.

Her body was not found until their now-grown son, who had been adopted shortly after his mother's disappearance, was renovating his boyhood home in 2014. He was tearing out a nonworking pool and outdoor shower in the backyard when he came across the bag of remains buried in the ground.

A .22-caliber shell was also found near the body, he said, and Michael Haim owned a .22-caliber rifle.

Although a medical examiner could not confirm how she was killed, Assistant State Attorney Alan Mizrahi told the jury that Michael Haim shot her and then buried her there in 1993.

""The truth was always out there, buried in their backyard,"" Mizrahi said in opening statements in the murder trial. ""The defendant's actions before the killing and after the killing demonstrate his depraved indifference to Bonnie Haim's life.""

Haim's defense attorney, Janis Warren, told the jury that prosecutors do not have enough evidence to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

""We agree she's dead. We agree that's her body in the backyard. But they have to prove to you that he did it,"" she said. ""When you listen to the evidence, ladies and gentlemen, and when you're finished, you're gonna see the lack of evidence in this case far outweighs any evidence they brought you.""

While Aaron Fraser said Tuesday he does not remember his birth mother's disappearance, he told a caseworker at the time, ""Daddy shot Mommy,"" according to the 2015 arrest affidavit.

That caseworker, Brenda Medders, testified Tuesday about her conversation with the boy in 1993, saying Aaron told her he knew his mother was hurt. When she asked who had hurt her, Medders said the boy told her, ""His daddy. His father.""

During extensive cross-examination, Medders confirmed that she had a bachelor's degree in social work at the time and had worked in the field for about one year when she was asked to interview Aaron.

UNCUT: Social worker Brenda Medders' testimony

Asked pointedly if she had asked the boy when his mother was hurt, if she had ascertained if he knew the difference between right and wrong or if she had tried to determine if the boy had been coached, she answered she had not.

Asked why she didn't, Medders answered, ""Due to his young age.""

""What I was trying to do is gather as many facts as I could, which he gave me many,"" she said.

1392,Former undercover CIA agent Michele Assad to give presentation at Cocoa Beach Library,"Former undercover CIA agent Michele Rigby Assad will have a presentation Monday at Cocoa Beach Library. (Photo: Photo provided by Michele Rigby Assad.)

Michele Rigby Assad spent 10 years working undercover for the government in Iraq and other secret locations throughout the Middle East.

The former U.S. Central Intelligence Agency’s Directorate of Operations officer has plenty of nail-biting stories.

Assad’s adventures are penned in her book, “Breaking Cover: My Secret Life in the CIA and What it Taught Me About What’s Worth Fighting For.” The book is in the works to become a movie.

You have the chance to hear directly from Assad Monday at 10 a.m. at the Cocoa Beach Library, where she’ll give a presentation.

“Expect to hear unique stories,” Assad said.

“I like to pull the veil back on intelligence and give people a taste of what operations are really like. And, of course, the bottom line is to share my story to illustrate that ordinary people can do extraordinary things when their faith and determination is greater than their fear.”

This is an encore presentation to one Assad did at the library in January. That one was so successful, about 50 people were turned away when the room hit its capacity. Those turned away were offered rainchecks for guaranteed seating for Monday’s presentation.

“At my events, I often hear, ‘I wish I would have brought my daughter or son or grandchild, as they would have been so interested in this,’” Assad said. “So here's a heads-up to bring whomever you think needs a little bit of inspiration.”

How do you end up in the CIA?

Assad grew up in nearby Mount Dora and never dreamed of being an undercover agent with the CIA. She met her husband, Joseph, while she was in high school and the two went on to Palm Beach Atlantic University, where they both earned degrees. They married in 1995 and she attended Georgetown University for graduate work while he was at George Mason.

The CIA was recruiting at Georgetown and both husband and wife submitted their resumes on a whim. To their surprise, both were accepted. The couple started a journey taking them on adventures, well, suitable for a movie.

Assad left the CIA in 2012. Since then, she has been a Brevard County resident and worked as a public speaker, trainer and security consultant.

Walk away inspired

Local resident Glenn Coleman read Assad’s book and worked with Tina Chalfant, a librarian at the Cocoa Beach Library, to bring Assad in as a speaker.

“I personally found her story to be tremendously inspiring,” Chalfant said. “I decided to work with Glenn, an amazing group of local residents and our Friends of the Library group to host her at the Brevard County’s Cocoa Beach Public Library.

""Having had the privilege of attending Michele’s presentation in January, I can say that attendees can expect an engaging, inspiring and interesting look into a walk of faith through the culture and challenges of work in both the CIA and the Middle East.”

The presentation is expected to last about an hour, with a meet and greet and book signing after.

“I hope everyone walks away inspired,” Assad said. “I hope they have renewed hope that we are capable of so much more than we think. I hope the presentation helps others to get out of their comfort zones to impact the world around them.""

1393,"Falcon Heavy rocket launch: Where to watch from Space Coast, Treasure Coast, Volusia County","It's been over a year.

Falcon Heavy, we ... are ... ready ... for ... you.

Millions around the world watched Feb. 6, 2018, as 27 Merlin engines roared to life at Kennedy Space Center, lifting SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket into the afternoon sky.

On Wednesday, April 10, a new mission, known as Arabsat 6A, will take a large, heavy communications satellite built by Lockheed Martin to orbit from launch pad 39A. Target liftoff time? 6:35 p.m. with the launch window through 8:32 p.m.

This marks Falcon Heavy's first operational mission since the demonstration flight last year that captured minds around the world with the Tesla Roadster and ""Starman"" mannequin strapped in the driver's seat.

Beginner's guide: Things to know about SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket launch

The BIG event: 5 reasons NOT to miss Falcon Heavy launch

Shortly after liftoff, Falcon Heavy's two side boosters will perform an aerial ballet, flip around and return to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Landing Zone 1 for tandem landings. The sonic boom-producing landings are typically visible to the public, especially from locations like Port Canaveral and the beaches.

In 2018, more than 100,000 visitors witnessed the historic demo flight of the most powerful rocket in the world.

Where can you see the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket launch? Obviously the Space Coast, but that bright orange-yellow dot in the sky can be seen from Volusia and Indian River counties, too. Here's a roundup of where to go.

In Brevard County

Pretty much anywhere in Brevard, you'll get a view of the rocket launch.

If you are viewing the launch along the Indian River in Titusville from Space View Park or Parrish Park, look east directly across the river.

If you are further south along the Indian River, look northeast.

Playalinda Beach or Canaveral National Seashore is the closest spot to view liftoff because it is almost parallel to pad 39A.

On the beach, look south along the coastline, (you can even see the pad from some spots).

Some hotspots to check out:

• Jetty Park Beach and Pier, 400 Jetty Park Road, Port Canaveral. Note, there's a charge to park: $15 for cars, $20 for RVs, $25 for buses.

• Playalinda Beach, 1000 Playalinda Beach Road, Canaveral National Seashore. Note, there's a charge to park, $10 per vehicle, and access to Canaveral National Seashore will be granted until capacity is reached or until 5:30 p.m., whichever comes first.

• Max Brewer Bridge and Parrish Park, 1 A. Max Brewer Memorial Parkway, Titusville. Note, parking is available on both sides of Max Brewer Bridge, with paved space for 46 vehicles and unpaved parking for an additional 100 vehicles.

• Space View Park, 8 Broad St., Titusville

• Sand Point Park, 10 E. Max Brewer Causeway, Titusville

• Rotary Riverfront Park, 4141 S. Washington Ave., Titusville

• Alan Shepard Park, 299 E. Cocoa Beach Causeway, Cocoa Beach. Note, it costs $15 per vehicle to park and no buses allowed.

• Cocoa Beach Pier, 401 Meade Ave. Parking fee varies.

• Lori Wilson Park, 1400 N. Atlantic Ave., Cocoa Beach

• Sidney Fischer Park, 2200 N. Atlantic Ave., Cocoa Beach. Note, it costs $15 per vehicle to park and no buses allowed.

Weather forecast: 'Fine' for Falcon Heavy launch from Kennedy Space Center

Traffic watch: AVOID these roadways during Falcon Heavy launch

In Indian River County

Visibility will depend on weather conditions, and people should make sure not to block traffic or rights of way on bridges and to follow posted rules at beaches. The best views here are along the beach, too. Look north.

Some hotspots to check out:

• House of Refuge and beach, 301 S.E. MacArthur Blvd., Stuart (If you stop by the house, it's $8 for adults, $7 for seniors and $6 for children.)

• Wabasso Beach Park, 1808 Wabasso Beach Road, Wabasso (Free parking)

• State Road A1A causeway in Stuart

• Fort Pierce Inlet, 905 Shorewinds Drive

• Sebastian Inlet Park, 9700 S. State Road A1A, Melbourne Beach ($8 per vehicle; limit eight people per vehicle)

• Ambersands Beach Park, 12566 N. S.R. A1A, Vero Beach (Free parking)

• South Beach Park, 1700 Ocean Drive, Vero Beach (Free parking)

• Alma Lee Loy Bridge in Vero Beach

• Merrill Barber Bridge in Vero Beach

In Volusia County

The best views here are along the beach. Look due south.

Readers have mentioned seeing a rocket launch from Daytona Beach and Ormond Beach. Here are some recommended spots:

• south side of New Smyrna Beach (Canaveral National Seashore), parking costs $10

• Bethune Beach, 6656 S. Atlantic Ave.

• Apollo Beach at New Smyrna Beach

To see the landing

Really, only Brevard gets to see this (or online if you're watching digitally and following along with our FLORIDA TODAY Space Team!). The best viewing locations to see the landing are from Port Canaveral and on the beach.

Last, but not least

Wherever you go to see the Falcon Heavy rocket launch, get there early. Traffic can be hectic on launch days. Arrive at your destination as early as possible and expect long lines at gates and in parking areas. In some cases, be prepared to pay — in cash — for parking.

Also, bring the right supplies. You could spend a couple hours in the Florida sun waiting for the launch. Be sure to pack bottled water and sunscreen. Don't forget about portable chargers for your phones, too.

Kim, an assisted-living-facility nurse from West Virginia, said she had pet skunks when she was young. Two years ago, she said she acquired Daffadil, but her husband wasn't immediately on board.

Jim, a machine operator, said he did not want a skunk in the house but now Daffadil is his favorite.

The skunks have been with Jim and Kim since they were six weeks old, Kim said. Daisy will celebrate her first birthday on March 8 and Daffadil will be 2 years old in August. Kim said her daughter, Keisha Miller, owns Daffadil’s sister, Jasmine.

The skunks came from Panhandle Exotics in Pensacola.

""When I first met them, especially Kim, (the skunks) were something she truly wanted and would care for,"" Christopher Evans, owner of the store since 2013, said.

Kim said Evans is picky about who he allows to adopt one of his exotic animals.

""If you’re buying a potential new member for your home … because they look cute, why do you need the animal?"" Evans said. ""There are a lot of things about them that are not cute, like picking up after them, feeding them. There’s a lot involved. They’re not always going to be cute.""

One of those less-adorable items in skunk ownership is the required licensing. In Florida, owners must have two permits to both possess skunks and take them out in public, Kim said, which they often do.

On the ""Daffadil Purdy Skunk Horton"" Facebook page, visitors can see pictures of the skunks out to dinner and on the town. Most recently, Daffadil and Daisy watched the Milton Mardi Gras parade. They also regularly visit Pensacola’s Gallery Night and accompany Jim and Kim to any restaurants that are pet friendly.

Another question the couple often answers is about the skunks’ diet. Their main food source is a grain-free cat food.

""But they love eggs, veggies, turkey (cooked) in coconut oil. They eat yogurt, most foods,"" Jim said, ""Daffadil likes ice cream.""

Other than the necessary de-scenting procedure at birth, Kim said owning a skunk is much like having a cat or dog. When they’re unhappy, like a cat hissing, they make a quieter ""huffing"" sound, Kim said, and will jump at a perceived threat with their claws out.

Otherwise, they’re litter-trained, sometimes sleep with the couple at night, chase toys and crawl in tubes, she said.

""They love to be loved on,"" she said.",https://www.thedestinlog.com/news/20190409/miltons-little-non-stinkers?rssfeed=true,2019-04-09T09:41:19Z,The Destin Log,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
1396,"After loss of limbs and unborn son, woman holds on to hope for family home in Ave Maria","CLOSE In March of 2017, Kayleigh Ferguson-Walker contracted sepsis, which caused her to lose her unborn child and all four of her limbs. She still struggles with grief and daily frustrations, but she tries to stay positive, and has continued to make progress with the help of her family and her faith. Alex Driehaus, Naples Daily News

Kayleigh Ferguson-Walker races her daughter down the driveway of their home and onto the cul-de-sac of their Coral Springs neighborhood — the little girl on a bike with training wheels, her mom in a motorized wheelchair.

Aaliyah shrieks and giggles when she beats her mom to the end of the driveway. But if Mom wins, it’s because she cheated.

“Again,” Aaliyah tells her mother about a dozen times. She wants to go again.

It’s warm out and Ferguson-Walker is ready to go back inside. Meanwhile, her 4-year-old zooms around like a Looney Tunes character.

Ferguson-Walker wants her daughter to have as normal a life as possible. She strives to be a dedicated mother despite some limitations.

When Ferguson-Walker had her arms and legs, she could run after her daughter and hold her. She would dance with Aaliyah when she came home from work every day. She could braid her girl’s hair. They could bake together and play at the park.

“Those things I do long for,” Ferguson-Walker, 32, said. “She remembers to this day, I promised her when I get my legs I’d dance with her.”

All the Moms: Girl, 4, hospitalized with life-threatening sepsis after trying on shoes without socks

Ferguson-Walker was a healthy, young mom and wife until the day her health spiraled.

She worked as a pharmacy technician. She and her husband, Ramon Ferguson-Walker, were expecting their second child — a boy they’d already named. She was six months pregnant.

The couple’s dream to buy a home was close to becoming a reality. They looked forward to raising their growing family in a two-story home in Ave Maria and be close to some of Ramon’s family.

Then things fell apart.

In March 2017, a deadly illness claimed Ferguson-Walker’s limbs and the life of her unborn child, but it didn’t take away her will to fight.

Like a bad flu



It felt like a bad flu.

The night she got sick, Ferguson-Walker thought she could sleep off the temperature spikes and chills, but her symptoms grew worse.

She asked her husband for water and juice, but she couldn’t keep the fluids down. Her heart raced.

Ramon packed his wife and daughter in their car and rushed them to the Broward Health Coral Springs emergency room. As doctors and nurses examined Ferguson-Walker and took her to the labor and delivery unit, her condition went into a steep decline.

She felt dizzy and had trouble breathing. Her vision was blurred. Her heart rate spiked and her blood pressure tanked. She couldn’t provide a urine sample; her kidneys were failing.

“Everything was failing,” Ramon Ferguson-Walker, 36, said.

Doctors induced labor. The couple’s baby boy didn’t survive.

Her heart continued to race. Her breathing was labored. Doctors sedated her and, ultimately, induced a coma to treat her.

Ferguson-Walker was in a coma for two weeks, her family gathered around a hospital bed praying for her recovery, hoping she would live.

In March of 2017, Kayleigh contracted sepsis, which caused her to lose her unborn child and all four of her limbs. Since then, she has been learning to complete tasks that have allowed her to slowly regain a level of independence, as well as learning how to fill her role as a mother in a different capacity.

At the hospital

When Ferguson-Walker emerged from her coma, she said she knew something was still wrong.

Her hands were puffy and black. Her extremities were necrotic, she said — the tissues died from lack of blood flow.

“I was a big water balloon,” Ferguson-Walker said.

Ramon Ferguson-Walker said his wife’s diagnosis came down to sepsis possibly caused by a complication in her pregnancy called incompetent cervix, a condition in which the pressure of a growing baby can cause the mother’s cervix to open prematurely, causing preterm labor or miscarriage. The condition can increase the risk of infection.

Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition in which the body becomes overwhelmed by an infection and essentially turns on itself, blocking blood flow to parts of the body and possibly causing extensive tissue damage and organ failure, if not death.

2017: 'Rory's Regs' on sepsis require hospital checklists, save lives

A lawsuit the couple filed in Broward County Circuit Court cited the diagnosis. The Ferguson-Walkers filed the suit in October 2018, seeking more than $15,000 in damages and alleging Kayleigh’s doctors were negligent in her prenatal care.

According to the suit, Kayleigh saw one of her doctors about a month before she got sick and was placed on antibiotics for symptoms related to incompetent cervix. One of her doctors discontinued the antibiotics a few days later, and that day she was admitted to Broward Health Coral Springs for monitoring and steroid injections. She was discharged the next day, according to the suit.

Two weeks later, Kayleigh landed in the hospital again with the life-threatening infection.

Kayleigh’s doctors filed defenses, denying negligence and contending the couple's own negligence contributed to her illness, according to court records.

Sepsis causes the body’s blood-clotting mechanism to go into overdrive, causing blockages in the blood vessels and keeping oxygen and nutrients from reaching tissues and organs.

(Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Her organs were spared from blood flow-related damage. Her limbs weren’t. When Ferguson-Walker emerged from the coma, she was transferred to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale for surgery. Doctors told her they would need to amputate her limbs.

Her family sprang up with questions: Were there no other options? What alternative treatments could be considered? Couldn’t some of her limbs be saved? How much time did they have to decide?

“We didn’t have the luxury of time to think about options,” said Dr. Robert Fletcher, Ferguson-Walker's surgeon. (Fletcher is not among the doctors the lawsuit accuses of negligence.)

Ferguson-Walker, still under the haze of medications and unable to ask many questions herself, didn’t take long to make her decision.

She told doctors to do whatever they needed to do to save her life.

Grateful

Ferguson-Walker said she is grateful to be alive. So is her family. But their gratitude still comes with pain.

Ferguson-Walker’s mother, Laurel Robinson, still gets emotional when she talks about what her daughter has gone through. She said it was hard to see her daughter lose her independence and struggle with everyday tasks people sometimes take for granted.

Robinson sometimes helps her daughter bathe. She put a shirt on Kayleigh one day after a bath and told her to put her arm through the sleeve.

“I was waiting for her arm to come through and realized it wouldn’t,” Robinson said.

Ferguson-Walker’s legs were amputated below the knee. Her left arm was amputated below the elbow; her right arm above the elbow.

“I do have faith but also question God,” Robinson said. “Why all four limbs? Why not just one? But I’m also glad she’s here in her daughter’s life and her husband’s. I know she’ll get better. She won’t be at this stage forever, but you still wonder when and why.”

Their gratitude also comes with frustration.

Ferguson-Walker wants to take care of herself independently again. To drive, bathe herself, go to work, take walks, swim. To not have to rely on anyone but herself to get to where she needs to be.

She gets discouraged sometimes, Ferguson-Walker said, because of everything she wishes she could do. But she works every day toward achieving goals and views her challenges as a journey.

“I’ve been thinking positively,” Ferguson-Walker said. “Thinking I have to go on in life and do things creatively. Take things one day at a time.”

In the two years since she fell ill, Ferguson-Walker has mastered feeding herself, putting on her makeup, combing her hair and getting herself around her parents’ home with the help of an electric wheelchair and a left-arm prosthetic with a hook attached. She can transfer herself from her regular wheelchair to the sofa in her parents’ living room.

She started seeing a therapist in the past few months and said talking to someone helps. For a while, she attended a support group for amputees at a Hanger Clinic in Broward, where she is being examined for prosthetics. Some of her wounds are still healing.

She said she would like to create her own support group of people closer to her age who survived sepsis or lost limbs. She is thinking of making motivational videos and doing speaking engagements somewhere down the line.

Her husband is there to challenge her, encourage her to take on new things and cheer on her progress.

He sometimes sends his wife YouTube videos of amputees talking about their journeys and showing what they have accomplished since the incidents that claimed their limbs. The videos, he hopes, will show her everything she can do and inspire her when she feels low. He looks for ways to make her life easier and tells her he believes in her.

“He pushes me,” Ferguson-Walker said.

She started to take up writing and drawing. She can fill out doctor’s forms with her prosthetic and draws pictures at home with Aaliyah.

In the past few months, she started transferring herself from her bed to her wheelchair and vice versa. It requires some twisting, wiggling and praying she won’t hit the ground, but she gets it done.

“Being able to do that felt good,” Ferguson-Walker said. “Once I got over the fear, the task became so much easier.”

Every accomplishment, every small step toward independence, is a victory.

“From 2017 to now, I see it as a new lifestyle,” Ferguson-Walker said. “I didn’t want to take it on as something impossible to live with, to live through. The triumph is still being here. Having a family, being a wife and mom.”

A home of their own

The couple and their daughter moved in with Kayleigh's parents when she was discharged from the hospital and rehabilitation programs. Kayleigh’s mom helped with her daughter’s personal care while Ramon was at work. Kayleigh’s dad, Charles Robinson, helps with Aaliyah’s care and drives her to and from school.

The couple’s dreams for the future, while postponed, also keep them afloat.

Two months before Ferguson-Walker got sick, the couple started the process of buying a home. They were almost ready to close on a house in Ave Maria.

“This puts a pause right in the middle of your dreams,” Ramon said. “We were looking forward to having another child, and this happened. We felt like we made it; we’re there, buying a home.”

Months after his wife’s illness, he said they had to decide whether they should go through with the purchase.

They did. Ramon said it was an opportunity they didn’t want to pass up. The house was a symbol of the hope they had before his wife’s illness, he said, but it wasn’t a good fit. It’s two stories tall, and while Kayleigh hopes to one day have prosthetics on her legs, she can’t climb stairs. The couple may sell or rent the house once they have a place they can move into.

The Ave Maria house serves as an escape for Ramon and Kayleigh when they need a break from the doctor’s appointments, insurance calls and general responsibilities. They try to drive from Coral Springs to Ave Maria every few weekends and visit some of Ramon’s family, watch movies and go out for ice cream. Their drives also allow them to see the progress of their home being built.

Aaliyah will have a room on the second floor. Ramon and Kayleigh will sleep on air mattresses or on a couch in the living room.

“Every time we come here, we’re holding on (to the hope),” Ramon said.

The home isn’t wheelchair-accessible, so the space Kayleigh can use is limited. They bought an Amazon Alexa device that gives Kayleigh some voice control over things such as the television, lights and thermostat.

Friends of the family are raising money to build a more accessible home not far from the one the couple bought.

After Kayleigh fell ill, a GoFundMe account was created to help the family with medical bills and expenses. The fundraising for the more accessible home is being done through a website called Fundly.

The couple said CC Homes, the builder of the home the Ferguson-Walkers bought, agreed to build them a more accessible one-story home and donate the labor. The house will have ramps, widened doorways and some basic smart technology.

Looking ahead

Despite the setbacks, low moments and frustrations, the couples’ faith in God, their family and each other keep them moving forward.

(Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Aaliyah saw her mom at the hospital when Kayleigh was being treated in 2017. The girl, then 2 years old, realized something was different and didn’t want to get too close to her mom at first. She became more comfortable once Kayleigh was moved to the rehab center and started asking questions.

Kayleigh told her, “Mommy’s legs and arms had to go, but I’ll get something to help me.”

It took her some time, but Aaliyah would get close and give her mom kisses. She’d grab a spoon and feed Kayleigh, then herself. She’d put on gloves and apply her mom’s lotion.

Aaliyah became her mom’s little helper and still is. She brushes Kayleigh’s hair, helps with her makeup and sometimes feeds her snacks.

The Ferguson-Walkers wanted their girl to have a little brother. Aaliyah probably would have been as caring for him as she is for her mom.

Kayleigh has her moments, but she said she has made peace with the loss of her baby. Talking to her husband and therapist helped her process the grief.

“The only way to move forward is to confront these things I’m uncomfortable with,” she said.

Robinson, Kayleigh’s mom, said it was difficult for her daughter to be around pregnant women at first. Kayleigh said she has become more comfortable being around babies, but she sometimes feels off balance when she is around baby boys.

“For the little one we lost, we’ll see him again,” Ramon said. “We work harder now because of how things have changed.”

For Kayleigh, the hard work of recovery will culminate in being able to dance with her daughter again.

1397,Florida police still don’t know why pregnant stepmom ‘strangled’ to death in cemetery,"EUSTIS — There are still more questions than answers as to why Sue-Ellen Anselmo was strangled in Greenwood Cemetery. Police are not talking, and her husband, John, says he was baffled by the confession of his son, Ian.

What is known is this: Police descended on the cemetery March 12 after Ian called to say he had strangled his stepmother. When officers arrived, a blood-soaked Ian stepped out of the car and police found Sue-Ellen slumped backward with a cord around her neck. She never regained consciousness and was taken off life support March 18 at an Orlando hospital.

But Sue-Ellen's 20-year-old daughter, Dejah-Thoris Waite, says the deadly chain of events began when she told her mother that she had been sexually abused by stepdad John Anselmo between 2014 and 2016. Sue-Ellen left John on March 6, after Waite disclosed the abuse.

Waite went further, portraying John Anselmo as violent and controlling and saying he sometimes hit Sue-Ellen.

“ … dad was sexually abusing me, and it went on for the duration of two years off and on,” Waite wrote in a letter to her mother. Waite shared a redacted copy with the Leesburg Daily Commercial.

The letter also referred to her mother being physically abused. “Every time I saw you get hit it was like I was getting hit myself.”

She continued, “Everything you ever said about brainwashing and just everything was true, and I always saw some things, but never truly saw the scope of how bad it was until I left. You deserve better and I’m so sorry your life has been what it is … ”

Waite said she, too, was abused. In a petition for an order of protection against John that she filed March 18, she claims that she was “kicked, punched, whipped with a belt and sexually abused” while living in the family home.

“I am currently caring for four of the minor children to my mom/stepdad and am afraid he will try to find me. I’m in fear for my safety and there is an ongoing DCF investigation,” Waite wrote. The Department of Children and Families confirmed that there is an ongoing investigation.

Waite noted in the petition that John made several phone calls to her mother “threatening her for seeking shelter at my house.”

He had a message for her, too, Waite said: “I should kill myself.”

Hours after Sue-Ellen was attacked, he “yelled at me at the hospital it was my fault his son attempted to murder my mother, and I believe he had a big part in it,” she wrote.

The slaying of the 39-year-old hair stylist has torn the estranged family to pieces.

On the one side is Sue-Ellen's biological family, including her mother and daughter, along with her friends and coworkers. On the other is the Anselmo family, which Sue-Ellen married into.

And while John Anselmo has not been charged with any crimes, official records reveal a series of close calls with the law and a termination from Lake County Schools for misconduct.

For his part, John Anselmo says he has no idea why his son, Ian, might have strangled Sue-Ellen to death.

“I don’t know why he did what he did,” John Anselmo said. “I am so very mad about it. It was so senseless.”

Waite said Ian ""never really liked my mom,"" but added, ""Ian doesn’t do anything unless his dad tells him to.”

ALLEGATIONS 'PATHETIC AND SAD'

Anselmo denies the allegations of abuse. In an interview, he said, “If there was abuse, why didn’t the other kids see it? I just loved my wife.""

“I don’t want to ruin my wife’s reputation, but there are things about my wife that people don’t know,"" he said. ""We were married 13½ years. I’m a stay-at-home dad who is with the children 95 percent of the time.""

""My wife was mentally ill, had bipolar, borderline personality disorder and adult ADHD,” he said, adding that she sometimes tried to hurt herself. “She was very, very unbalanced when she was not on her meds.""

Of Waite, he said, “She’s bipolar, too.” He also called her “a liar,” adding, “She just wants attention. It’s pathetic and sad.”

“Wow!” Waite said, when she heard Anselmo’s description of her and her mother.

“She had ADHD, and she took medicine for that. That’s all,” Waite said of attention deficit disorder. Nor is she herself bipolar, she said.

As for being called a liar, Waite said: “What do you expect him to say, ‘I did it?’”

Waite said she also reported the abuse allegations to police.

CONFLICT IN THE HOME

Anselmo said Sue-Ellen didn’t have friends, just work acquaintances and clients. The reason for that is that Anselmo is “very controlling,” said Sue-Ellen’s friends, who say they are fearful of retaliation and do not want to be identified. He forced Sue-Ellen to wear long dresses and other conservative clothing, drove her to work and picked her up, friends said.

He blocked Sue-Ellen’s relationship with her mother, Cynthia Miller, because she took Waite in when she was 18, friends said.

Miller was granted temporary, emergency guardianship of Sue-Ellen while she was on life support. Miller’s petition, filed the day after the attack, said “there appears to be an imminent danger that the physical or mental health or safety” of Sue-Ellen, or that her property would be “wasted, misappropriated or lost.”

It noted that Ian had been arrested and said, “The … husband is a person of interest in the investigation.”

That may have been true then, but on March 21, Eustis Police Sgt. Jim Franquiz said, “At this time, John Anselmo is not a person of interest.""

Anselmo acknowledged being estranged from Waite “because we didn’t approve of her husband.”

In 2016, John attacked Waite’s future husband at her grandparents’ home, slamming his head into a wall and knocking him over a glass table, according to the man in a Eustis police report. The couple decided not to press charges for what would have amounted to a simple battery misdemeanor.

There was an even scarier incident in 2017, according to a man who also does not want to be identified.

The man said he knew Sue-Ellen from high school, and they briefly dated in their early 20s. When friends told him that she was a hair stylist in Eustis, he called the shop for an appointment. She was gone for the day, so a worker gave him Sue-Ellen’s cellphone number. He called and left a message asking for an appointment.

He said Anselmo heard the message and called him in a rage.

“Hey man, it’s not like that, I have a fiancé and two kids,” he said he told Anselmo. The two got into a heated argument and at one point, he gave Anselmo his address. “I told him if he showed up here, he was going to get a bullet in the head.”

He called police and told them about the phone call.

Thirty minutes later, John and Ian showed up at the house, according to a Leesburg police report. The man fired a warning shot at the two with a rifle because John had a pistol in his pocket, the report said.

Officers did not file charges or make any arrests.

John Anselmo made headlines in 2015 when he was fired as a teacher.

In one incident, at a store in Mount Dora, he misinterpreted a fellow teacher’s remarks to another female colleague “as a personal affront,” according to Lake School Board records.

“Eschewing self-restraint, respondent approached Mrs. …. and demanded to know if she was talking about him. Moments later, while gazing at Mrs. … breasts, respondent uttered, 'Fakey, fakey, fakey.’”

He told her “that, because he was unwilling to fight a woman, he would instead ‘beat (her) husband’s ass.’”

He went to the husband’s workplace, but the man was not there.

He also reportedly misinterpreted a casual nod by a 21-year-old student at the vocational training center as a challenge, then threatened him and his cousin.

“Do you little boys want to get your asses beat?” John Anselmo reportedly asked the man.

An administrative judge ruled that the district improperly fired him after first giving him a letter of reprimand. The district paid $60,000 in back pay and other expenses, but Anselmo was no longer working for the school district.

A former customer of the hair salon said she quit coming to the salon after the school board story appeared in news stories. He made her uncomfortable, she said, because he ogled her while waiting to pick up Sue-Ellen from work.

A TEARFUL FAREWELL

On March 21, Waite wept as she told 450 mourners at a memorial service how much she treasured the last few days she was able to spend with her mother, and she aimed the message directly at Sue-Ellen.

“I just wanted to do everything that we were supposed to do, and God had other plans for you. You had the courage to make the biggest move of your life, and I can’t say enough … I’m so proud of you. I’ll have a hole in my heart for the rest of my life, but I know you’re still with me.”

Earlier, John had arranged a private, invitation-only funeral. He also made arrangements for her burial — at Greenwood Cemetery.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190330/florida-police-still-dont-know-why-pregnant-stepmom-strangled-to-death-in-cemetery?rssfeed=true,2019-03-30T16:24:11Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
1398,Practice Observations: Florida State pivots focus as it returns from spring break,"CLOSE The Seminoles returned to practice for the first time Wednesday after being off last week for spring break. Curt Weiler, Tallahassee Democrat

After 11 days off, Florida State got back to work Wednesday morning.

The FSU football team returned to the Dunlap Athletic Training Facility for another spring practice after it had last week off for spring break.

""I’m expecting our guys to come back and continue the progress we made in the first part of spring ball,"" FSU head coach Willie Taggart said.

""The last couple days, we got the spring break out of them, ran around a little bit, got ourselves back in football shape.""

The break came at the almost exact halfway point of spring practice. The Seminoles had eight practices before the break. Wednesday's practice was the first of seven after returning that will culminate with the Garnet and Gold Spring Game on April 6.

While much of the first half of spring dealt with installing a new offensive terminology, Taggart hopes to see a pivot in focus over the final stretch of spring.

""As we finish these last seven practices, we’ve got to sharpen up the things that we’re doing from a technique and fundamental standpoint,"" Taggart said.

""And then make sure we have the right guys in the right place to make sure we are able to accomplish the things we want to get accomplished.""

Nole Drills

For the first time this spring, redshirt sophomore running back Khalan Laborn took contact during Nole Drills.

His return to action since suffering a dislocated kneecap in September has been gradual, but his participation Wednesday was a big step in the right direction.

Laborn moved without issue and swerved through tight spaces with ease in the drill, showing the athleticism that made him a five-star recruit coming out of high school.

A few offensive linemen held their own in Nole Drills against the more talented defensive linemen.

Redshirt freshman Chaz Neal won the first rep of the drill and drove his defender backward.

Mike Arnold also had a nice rep against redshirt freshman Malcolm Lamar.

Other than that, many of the reps were owned by the defense. Marvin Wilson had his usual jaw-dropping rep as he knocked center Baveon Johnson back off the line in an impressive physical display.

A few of the outside linebackers got reps at the defensive line spot in the drill as well. Junior Leonard Warner won his rep handily against junior college transfer Jay Williams.

Downfield, early enrollee linebacker Jaleel McRae pushed his way past sophomore tight end Alexander Marshall, forcing him to illegally hold him.

At wide receiver, sophomore Ontaria Wilson held his block for an impressive amount of time which sprung running back Anthony Grant for a score.

Offense

After Nole Drills and some individual position drills, the quarterbacks and wide receivers paired up for collaborative work.

The wideouts ran post or crossing routes and the quarterbacks were asked to deliver anticipatory passes as the receivers broke in their route.

There was no defensive presence to make things more difficult, but each of the quarterbacks and wideouts observed found success in the drill.

Redshirt freshman wide receiver Jordan Young tracked down a ball with impressive speed for his size to make the catch.

None of the quarterbacks had any of the accuracy issues seen in the two open practices. Redshirt freshmen Nolan McDonald and Jordan Travis hit their targets consistently in the short time the media was able to observe.

The running backs worked with the quarterbacks on read-option plays and then went through agility drills for the remainder of the open portion of practice.

FSU offensive line coach Randy Clements made a special emphasis around tempo and minimizing the downtime between reps.

Whether rushing back to begin another rep or exchanging players between reps, going fast was the goal.

From all those around the program have said this spring, this work has paid off as the offense is working faster than it did last spring in its first offseason with the new tempo.

The first-team offensive line at Wednesday's practice consisted of Jauan Williams, Brady Scott, Baveon Johnson, Arnold and Neal.

The second team had Jalen Goss, Christian Armstrong, Andrew Boselli, Dontae Lucas and Landon Dickerson, who appeared to be limited.

Defense

The FSU linebackers were split up into three separate groups at Wednesday's practice.

The two star linebackers, Hamsah Nasirildeen and Amari Gainer, worked with a graduate assistant in one endzone.

The middle mike linebackers -- by far the largest group -- worked with linebackers coach Raymond Woodie Jr. Dontavious Jackson, Emmett Rice, DeCalon Brooks and McRae were included in this group.

The weak-side will linebackers, Josh Brown, Warner and Adonis Thomas, worked with linebackers/special teams coach Mark Snyder.

With Snyder coaching defensive ends last year, FSU didn't have the staff to break its linebackers apart like this.

This newfound ability -- and the specialization it should provide -- could be crucial to help improve a unit that was the weakness of the Seminoles' defense last season.

The FSU defensive backs worked on backpedaling and tracking passes in the air to make plays on the ball.

Stanford Samuels III came down with an impressive one-handed catch and early enrollee Raymond Woodie III -- who Taggart discussed on his talk show this week for standing out -- was smooth and fast in his movement and changed directions with ease.

Injured/Absent

Senior tight end Gabe Nabers did not practice Wednesday, joining offensive lineman Cole Minshew and defensive back Jaiden Woodbey, both out for the spring.

Defensive tackle Cedric Wood and Rice both practiced in what seemed to be a full capacity despite wearing casts on their hands.

Other Guests

With FSU set to hold its annual Pro Day Thursday, a number of former players were in attendance at Wednesday's practice.

Included in this group were former defensive tackles Fred Jones and Demarcus Christmas and former offensive linemen Derrick Kelly and Arthur Williams. All are set to work out at Pro Day Thursday.

Former FSU defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi -- now with the Kansas City Chiefs -- was also out at Wednesday's practice.

Up Next

The Seminoles next practice Friday morning, but it will be closed to the media. Saturday's scrimmage will be closed as well.

The final practice of spring which the media will be able to observe will be Wednesday, April 3.",http://rssfeeds.tallahassee.com/~/600052536/0/tallahassee/home~Practice-Observations-Florida-State-pivots-focus-as-it-returns-from-spring-break/,2019-03-27T13:23:18Z,Tallahassee Democrat,Couple,"277 N Magnolia Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA",FL,32301
1399,March Madness: No. 1 Duke does just enough to hold off Central Florida at buzzer,"CLOSE SportsPulse: While there are no real Cinderellas left in the tournament USA TODAY's Trysta Krick explains why that's okay and looks ahead to the Sweet 16. USA TODAY

COLUMBIA, S.C. — There was always a danger of this for Duke, even as the No. 1 team in college basketball won all but one game this season when fully healthy.

Imperfectly constructed, crazy reliant on youth, often prone to tossing bricks at the rim, the margin between history and infamy was destined to be so, so thin.

And on Sunday night, at the very last moment of a second-round howitzer of an NCAA tournament game, that margin was literally one roll of a ball off the rim.

Duke escaped the second round, 77-76, barely holding on to beat No. 9 seed Central Florida when B.J. Taylor’s runner caromed too strong off the glass and a follow-tip by Aubrey Dawkins caught three different parts of the rim before gravity pulled it off to the side.

“It kills me that it didn’t fall,” Taylor said.

“I thought it was going to go,” said UCF coach Johnny Dawkins, Aubrey’s father and one of Mike Krzyzewski’s first great players at Duke in the mid-1980s.

“Coach K talks a lot about the basketball gods,” said Zion Williamson, the spectacular Duke freshman. “They had our back tonight.”

As Krzyzewski acknowledged, Duke got a little bit lucky. But a team constructed around three lottery picks shouldn’t need to feel like it won the lottery just to beat the third-place team from the American Athletic Conference, even in a crazy format like the NCAA tournament that is built for monumental opening-weekend upsets.

ROAD TO MINNEAPOLIS: 2019 NCAA tournament schedule and results

Sure, UCF was brilliant, putting forth one of the best losing efforts in recent memory. First there was Aubrey Dawkins, who scored 32 points on 12-of-18 shots and unleashed a barrage of second-half jumpers that nearly made him a tournament legend. And then there was Tacko Fall, the 7-foot-6 giant who wasn’t so gentle when he had to defend Williamson on Sunday,. Combined with the elder Dawkins’ second-half adjustment to drop his defense completely off Duke’s poor outside shooters and use Fall as an anchor in the paint to mess with Duke’s sightlines, a team that came into the tournament as an afterthought looked like it was ready to bust everyone’s bracket.

“You miss and make shots, and you’ve got to live with it,” Aubrey Dawkins said. “We got the opportunity, and it just didn’t go.”

But the thing is, it’s now clear how easy Duke’s offense is to discombobulate because for all the great recruiting of McDonald’s All-Americans that Krzyzewski has done recently, this year he forgot to get a couple more who can shoot.

Tre Jones, the Blue Devils’ defensive bulldog of a point guard, has been ultra-valuable this season in so many ways. But in a game like this, where it was clear UCF wanted to test whether a 24 percent three-point shooter was going to make them completely unguarded, he was too quick to oblige by going 1-for-8 from the arc. At one point in the second half, when it looked like Duke was a few good possessions from pulling away, he hoisted jumpers on three straight trips, completely changing the energy of the situation in UCF’s favor. In the second half, Duke shot just 35% and needed every last one of them to escape into the East Regional semifinal.

“We had a lot of stuff go on today that was difficult for us — and the most difficult was the other team, and we were able to find a way to win,” Krzyzewski said. “But these kids, they have it. They have it.”

Give Duke this much: Led by Williamson, this is a ferociously competitive bunch with a deep reserve of guts and a nose for the ball when it matters. Down four with less than two minutes left and searching for answers on offense, a three-pointer by wing Cam Reddish pulled Duke back within range.

Then, down 76-73 with less than a minute left, we got the confrontation America had been waiting for: Williamson challenging Fall at the rim, everything on the line for Duke. As Williamson had figured out by then, after Fall had blocked his shot three times earlier and fouled him a couple more, there’s no easy way to score on 7-foot-6. So this time Williamson skied high in the air, the way he typically does for his highlight-reel dunks, only this time contorting his body a bit sideways to create space, bank in the layup and draw Fall’s fifth foul on the collision.

“A lot’s going through my mind,” said Williamson, whose final bucket gave him 32 points. “But like coach said, I consider him the greatest coach of all time, and when he looks at you and tells you you’re made for this moment, it’s like the most confidence you can be given. So when I went to the basket, I knew it was going in.”

It’s the kind of play only a few people in the world would have been strong enough, nimble enough and athletic enough to make. And because that’s exactly who Williamson is, Duke promises to be difficult to extinguish from this tournament.

“I just tried to get the ball into the hands of my two best players,” Krzyzewski said, referring to Williamson and R.J. Barrett, who both, in the winning moments, found a way to transcend what was happening to Duke as it started at tournament mortality.

Though Williamson missed the free throw that would have tied the game, Barrett was able to sneak in for a putback that finally gave Duke the lead with 11 seconds left — another one of those plays where you can throw all the strategy out the window and it’s simply Best Man Wins.

“I remember watching March Madness and watching a whole bunch of games and seeing missed free throws, somebody gets a rebound and a putback,” Barrett said. “So I thought, I’m just going to try to do whatever I can to get this rebound.”

We probably shouldn’t have been surprised Duke pulled out that game in that manner. Though not as dramatic as this one, Duke has been the classic “find a way to win” team all season, coming up with exactly what it needs, exactly when it needs it.

“Hopefully we can continue to advance, but I love who they are, and I have confidence in them,” Krzyzewski said. “If they didn’t come through, I’ve got their backs. But they did come through.”

Having that kind of will is extremely valuable in an NCAA tournament. So is the ability to make outside shots to put away games, which the Blue Devils just don’t seem to possess. That never-ending balance between brilliance and frailty hasn’t mattered yet for Duke. But which way it tips is really going to matter now.",http://rssfeeds.floridatoday.com/~/599963184/0/brevard/home~March-Madness-No-Duke-does-just-enough-to-hold-off-Central-Florida-at-buzzer/,2019-03-25T01:54:08Z,Florida Today,Couple,"1 Gannett Plaza Ave, Melbourne, FL 32940, USA",FL,32940
1406,Homecoming for Jacksonville sailor killed at Pearl Harbor,"Herbert Joseph Poindexter, better known as H.J., grew up poor in Jacksonville and went to Andrew Jackson High School. In 1936, in the depths of the Great Depression, the Navy seemed a good way out of poverty, so he joined up and made his way to the Pacific Ocean.

JACKSONVILLE — The Western Union telegram came on Dec. 21, 1941, two weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, confirming what Bessie Meyer already knew: Her son was gone.

""The Navy Department deeply regrets to inform you that your son Herbert Joseph Poindexter Jr Seaman First Class US Navy is missing following action in the performance of his duty and in the service of his country. The Department appreciates your great anxiety and will furnish you further information promptly.""

In February, another telegram arrived: ""After exhaustive search it has been impossible to locate your son ... and he has therefore been officially declared to have lost his life.""

Herbert Joseph Poindexter, better known as H.J., grew up poor in Jacksonville and went to Andrew Jackson High School. In 1936, in the depths of the Great Depression, the Navy seemed a good way out of poverty, so he joined up and made his way to the Pacific Ocean.

He was 24 when he died five years later, a barber on the battleship USS Oklahoma. He figured he'd be at sea another couple of years, then move to Arizona, where he had a fiancee and a ranch on which he was making payments.

But war caught up with him on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, when Japanese planes torpedoed the Oklahoma, docked at Ford Island. The ship quickly capsized.

Poindexter and 428 other men from the ship were killed, among the more than 2,400 Americans who died in the attack on Hawaii.

Back in Jacksonville, Mayor John T. Alsop paid him tribute at a memorial service at Central Christian Church, as did a representative from Scout Troop No. 230, of which the sailor had been a member.

That might have provided some comfort to Poindexter's mother and his younger sisters, Lilyan and Helen. But they had no coffin to grieve by, no physical evidence of his passing.

H.J.'s body could not be identified among those recovered from the wreck. And no one could even be sure if his were among the hundreds of remains from the Oklahoma crew that were buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu.

But in 2015, members of the military's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency exhumed the unknown remains from the ship, counting on modern science to finally identify those who had died. And in September 2018, the agency's scientists got a DNA match: H.J. Poindexter had finally been found.

This June, more than 77 years after he died, he will buried at the national cemetery in Jacksonville, his hometown.

His mother and sisters all passed away well before he was identified.

""But I know it would have meant so much to them,"" said Poindexter's niece, Lisa Williams of Fernandina Beach.

The military reached out to her after the identification project began, hoping to get a DNA sample from a family member to aid in the search. She is the daughter of H.J.'s sister Helen, but she is adopted.

Yet she could still help. She told them: There is a surviving blood relative, the son of H.J.'s other sister, Lilyan.

In Tucson, Ariz., Joe Allen took the provided DNA kit, swabbed the inside of his cheek and sent the kit back. It led to a positive match.

Allen, a retired medical physicist, said his mother and her sister idolized their brother, and told him what a good man he was and how crushed they and their mother were by H.J.'s death.

Neither Allen, 76, nor his cousin Williams, who is 56, were born while he was alive. Yet they heard stories, and Williams had her mother's collection of photos and those fateful telegrams from the Navy.

""Even though it had been so long, it seemed like he was part of the family,"" Williams said. ""He had a farm in Arizona, he had a fiancee, he had what looked like a real bright future.""

Poindexter had a car that he'd left in Arizona, and after he was killed his mother and sisters drove there to collect it. They met his fiancee and shared their sorrow. Later the young woman sent H.J.'s mother a letter: She was getting married.

""She wanted to let her know she was safe and had met a fine man and wanted to start a family,"" Allen said. ""And of course my grandmother was happy to know that. Even though she didn't really know the young lady, she felt a tie because of her connection to H.J.""

Though he was gone, he continued to influence his family.

Joe Allen goes by his middle name, which his mother gave him in honor of H.J.'s middle name. And Williams, a wallpaper hanger, said her mother joined the Women's Army Corps in 1942, learned to fly planes, and piloted supply planes stateside during the war.

""She felt very patriotic and wanted to honor his memory,"" she said. ""They depended on him — and then he was gone, never getting to say goodbye.""

The family's tradition of military service has continued: Williams' youngest son became a Marine, and served two tours in Afghanistan.

Williams said she gets teary-eyed thinking about how much it means that her uncle's remains, along with those of others from his ship, are finally being identified.

""I just started crying because I knew how much that would have meant to my mom and aunt and grandmother,"" she said. ""It was just really touching, that they took science and turned it into something so emotional to all of these families.""

1414,Navarre Rotary to raffle a gun a day during May,"NAVARRE — “Mega May Giveaway!” the Rotary Club of Navarre’s flyer announces in a bold red font to promote its 4th annual Gun Raffle to raise money for youth and other nonprofit organizations.

Each of the 31 days in May, handguns, rifles and semi-automatics will be raffled to those lucky enough to possess one of the 1,000 tickets sold. One ticket costs $35, or you can buy three tickets for $100.

The value of the weapons gradually rise during the month, starting May 1 with a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun valued at $249 and ending May 31 with the grand prize, a Daniel Defense semi-automatic rifle priced at $1,549.

Navarre Rotary President T.J. Goulet estimated that only about 150 tickets remain that the public can buy from Rotarians, Oak Ridge Gun Range, Broxson Outdoors, Navarre Auto Repair or online at Navarrerotarygunraffle.com.

He said the gun raffle was a fit for this area and that he expects it to sell out, just like the three previous ones did.



“The Rotary doesn’t make political statements. We are free to own guns,” Goulet said, citing the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protecting American’s rights to keep and bear arms. “There are no moral issues. High schools have shooting clubs. To us, it’s not controversial.”

“I was a hunter as a small child,” he added. “I had a single shot .410 as an 8-year-old. I have never had one of my guns shoot a person. We live in an area where guns are popular.”

The Rotary Club of Crestview, Laurel Hill Volunteer Fire Department and Holt Volunteer Fire District are among other local groups that have held similar gun raffles over the years.

Gay Valimont, a Gulf Breeze resident, understands the Rotary Club of Navarre isn’t the only one that runs a gun raffle to raise money. However, the volunteer leader of the Florida Chapter for Moms Demand Action, a “gun sense” advocacy group, called for caution.

“My concern is once those weapons are in the hands of people they will want to make a couple of bucks off it,” said Valimont, as she drove to Tallahassee to support state lawmakers’ gun control legislation. “No background check is required. The Rotary Club needs to consider the unintentional consequences that could happen with this.”

Navarre Rotary gives away all the money it raises, among other things, to scholarships for Navarre High School graduates, the Weekend Food Program for disadvantaged Navarre students and the Holiday Meals Program.

Additionally, the club holds several annual fundraisers, including a pancake breakfast every fall and a chili cook-off at the Gulf Breeze Zoo during Zoo Lights.

Doug Kennedy said he has one problem with the gun raffle. He works at Navarre Auto Repair that sponsors the fundraiser.

“I liked it better when cash was the grand prize,” he said.

1415,Snapper fishing steady offshore and dolphin running along weed line in St. Lucie County,"CLOSE Fishing should rebound after these next two windy days. Ed Killer, Wochit

Indian River County

The mangrove shorelines, along areas preserved by the Indian River Land Trust or along Jungle Trail near Wabasso, have been good spots to zero in on action with snook, trout and redfish. Trout are taking live shrimp, artificial shrimp, jerk baits and at first light, topwater plugs like the MirrOlure 7M series and Rapala Skitterwalks. Offshore, kingfish are biting in 40-60 feet of water. Drift live baits for the best bites.

St. Lucie County

The snapper fishing offshore has been steady in 60-110 feet of water. There are some throwback grouper being caught on the live reefs, but May 1 is still a few weeks away. That's when season opens again for gag grouper, red grouper, black grouper and scamp. Dolphin are scattered, but when anglers find a few running along a weed line, they are getting one or two quality fish up to the 40-pound range. Have a couple of spinning rods rigged up ready to pitch baits, cut bait or small jigs to catch several smaller dolphin. And always leave the first hooked dolphin in the water to rile up the school around it for more catches.

Martin County

Inshore anglers are enjoying one of the strongest starts to the spring snook season. Slot fish are being found at many of the inshore spots with structure such as the Roosevelt Bridge, the Evans Crary Bridge (accessible by boat only) and Twin River Park in Port Salerno. Swim baits like the Live Target selection of small mullet or sardines are working best. There are plenty of jack crevalles roaming around to bend rods. In the Indian River Lagoon, tripletail can be caught on pilings. Offshore, there have been a few cobia in 70-100 feet of water, but the sharks are bad. Dolphin action has been scattered, so be ready to cover water to find bites. Freelancer anglers Mike Ianiello, Mike Pavlich and George Kling, out of Pirates Cove Marina, caught several dolphin Saturday up to 47.1 pounds trolling a ballyhoo with a purple skirt behind a bird in 300 feet of water north of the inlet off the power plant.

Lake Okeechobee

Bass fishing has been very good at the lake with anglers catching 30-40 fish per trip. For anglers who prefer to fish with artificial lures, try starting the day off with a topwater frog, Zara Spook Jr., Chug Bug or spinnerbait in the double willow leaf pattern and cast in the bulrushes. After the sun has been up for an hour, switch over to mid-depth soft plastic jigs such as flukes, senkoes or jerk baits. Worms work better in deeper areas. Wild shiners are working best for anglers who are not as experienced at making casts, but will produce big fish.

1416,"Richard Cole, last surviving member of the Doolittle Raiders, dies at 103 in Texas","CLOSE Retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole is 97, but that didn't stop him from taking the controls and flying a vintage B-25 bomber at a reunion of the famous World War II Doolittle Raiders. (April 18) AP

Retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole, the last survivor of the Doolittle Raid, the first U.S. strike on the Japanese islands during World War II, died Tuesday in Texas. He was 103.

Cole was one of 80 men sent to target factory areas and military installations in Japan on April 18, 1942. The daring raid stunned Japan and is credited with boosting U.S. morale and helping turn the tide of the war in the Pacific.

“There’s another hole in our formation. Our last remaining Doolittle Raider has slipped the surly bonds of Earth, and has reunited with his fellow Raiders,” General David Goldfein, chief of staff of the Air Force said Tuesday. “The Legacy of the Doolittle Raiders – his legacy – will live forever in the hearts and minds of Airmen, long after we’ve all departed.”

Richard Cole was the last surviving member of the Doolittle Raiders (Photo: Meg Jones/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)

Cole, born in Dayton, Ohio, was mission commander Jimmy Doolittle’s co-pilot in the all-volunteer attack which took place less than five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

After bombing targets in northwest Tokyo, Cole's plane turned toward China with plans to land at an airfield. But things went awry when authorities at the airfield heard their engines, assumed it was Japanese and turned off the lights. Cole and Doolittle couldn't find a place to land at night.

Shortly before running out of fuel, everyone bailed out; Cole gave himself a black eye when he pulled his parachute ripcord. He landed in a tree where he spent the night, climbing down in the morning, and walking the whole day before finding a couple of Chinese students who eventually took him to Doolittle, who said, ""Boy, am I glad to see you.""

David Thatcher: 79th Doolittle Raider dies in Montana

Of the 80 men who flew from the USS Hornet deck, three died in the raid, and four who were captured by the Japanese were executed or starved to death. Two others who survived the raid were later killed while flying the China-Burma-India route over the Himalayas known as the ""Hump.""

After the raid, Cole went to India, helped establish the dangerous Hump flying route and flew more than 100 missions carrying cargo, earning three Distinguished Flying Crosses.

The Doolittle Raiders received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2015, and donated it to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Ohio.

Cole, who often attended Raider-related events and air shows, told The Associated Press last year that since he was older than many of the other Raiders, he didn’t expect to be the last.

“I figured that Mother Nature and the good man upstairs would pick the time, and I wouldn’t have any control over it,” he said.

Cole will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the Air Force Times reported, and memorial services are also being scheduled at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in Texas.

1417,"Pensacola man allegedly trapped girlfriend in their home, abused her for four days","A Pensacola man was arrested Sunday after his girlfriend accused him of forcing her to remain inside their shared home for four days and inflicting physical abuse on her.

John Patrick Brewington, 28, has been arrested on charges that include battery, battery by strangulation, kidnapping, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, cocaine possession, possession of a controlled substance without a prescription, possession of a synthetic cannabinoid and possession of drug equipment.

An Escambia County Sheriff's Office deputy conducted a welfare check of the couple's residence Sunday after the woman’s mother contacted the Sheriff’s Office out of concern for her daughter, according to Brewington's arrest report.

The young woman told deputies that she began dating Brewington in January and moved in with him a few weeks later, according to his arrest report.

The woman told deputies that she picked up Brewington on April 3 and they drove to her work together. She went to work and allowed Brewington to use her car to go see his probation officer.

Later in the day when she asked for her car keys back, he would not give them to her, the report states.

The physical abuse allegedly began later that night. When the woman tried to get her keys back for a second time, she said that Brewington choked her. When she tried to escape the residence, she claimed that Brewington threw her to the ground and beat her legs with a broom handle.

The following day, on April 4, the woman said she again tried to leave the residence, but Brewington stopped her by force, the report stated.

She told deputies Brewington left their residence with all of her personal belongings on April 5 and the woman was left at the residence by herself.

When deputies questioned why the woman didn’t leave when Brewington wasn’t around or contact ECSO, the woman said she was too afraid to leave, claiming Brewington had threatened to kill her and her family if she contacted law enforcement.

She told deputies that when Brewington returned later on April 5, she again attempted to get her car keys back. The report stated that Brewington reacted to this by grabbing the woman by the hair, dragging her into their living room and shoving her face into the couch.

The woman described multiple other attempts to leave the home through the front door, only to be forcibly stopped and subsequently abused, according to the report. The woman told deputies who responded to the home Sunday that Brewington was still refusing to return her car keys.

Deputies observed bruises and injury marks on the woman's skin consistent with the abuse she described. When deputies searched the residence, they also found multiple illegal drugs, including 40 pills of ecstasy.

Brewington was booked into the Escambia County Jail around 3 p.m. Sunday. His bond was set at $71,000.

Full week of games for your Miami Marlins. Three at home and three on the road. Let’s start with road trip to Ohio.

The Marlins face the Reds today through Thursday. Last season the Reds lost 95 games. Their big offseason acquisition was Yasiel Puig. Last season for the Dodgers, Puig hit 23 home runs, drove in 63 runs and batted .267. He can be volatile in the clubhouse but he can also slug the baseball.

Then, the Marlins return home to take on division rivals, the Philadelphia Phillies, and of course, the big draw there, is Bryce Harper. The megastar signed with the Phillies in the offseason and this will be Marlins fans first chance to see him on his new team. Plus, there are a couple of fun giveaways at Marlins Park. Saturday night’s game is a bucket hat giveaway for the first 10,000 fans and Sunday the team is giving away kids’ sunglasses to the first 5,000 fans age 14 and under.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/04/09/cheap-seats-marlins-preview-2/,2019-04-09T15:14:05Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394

He would practice his guitar for hours in his Northern California room as a teen, trying to recreate the chords of the Beatles and the Doors.

“My dad would say, 'How come you're not across the street, playing football with the other kids?"" Brad Gillis said in a telephone interview this week.

""And he'd always say, 'Son, you have to have something to fall back on if this musical thing doesn’t happen.' ""

As it turns out, Gillis never needed anything else. The guitarist for Night Ranger — who performs Thursday night in Bonita Springs at the Southwest Florida Event Center — has played music that millions have heard on records, compact discs, cassettes, live in concert, on the radio, on ESPN's ""Sports Center"" and video games.

Gillis said he knew he made the big time when he performed with his first major band, Rubicon, at California Jam II before some 350,000 at a Southern California race track. He even repeats the date, March 18, 1978, in describing the mega-concert that featured Aerosmith, Santana, Foreigner, Heart, Ted Nugent and others.

Rubicon broke up and he and a few other members, bassist Jack Blades and drummer and vocalist Kelly Keagy, formed Ranger that later became Night Ranger. While Night Ranger took time to gain recognition, Gillis worked with other bands in Berkeley, California, including one that performed Ozzy Osbourne songs.

Osbourne's guitar player, Randy Rhoads, had died in a plane crash in Florida in March 1982. Ozzy's wife, Sharon, called Gillis, asking him if he was interested in auditioning for her husband's band in New York City.

""I got the gig and started touring with Ozzy all around the world,"" Gillis said. “It was pretty exciting for me. I’m this green kid in his 20s going on stage before 10,000 to 20,000 people a night.”

He returned to Night Ranger in time for that band's rise to stardom. Night Ranger peaked in popularity in the mid-1980s with power rock ballads, especially ""Sister Christian"" that released in June 1984, with a popular video on MTV that today has more than 18 million YouTube views.

The band churned out other hits too, including ""Don't Tell Me You Love Me"" in 1982 and ""When You Close Your Eyes"" from the quintet's 1983 album ""Midnight Madness.""

“The cool thing back then was MTV didn’t have a lot of content in its 24-hour cycle,” Gillis said. ""They embraced us pretty well.” 'Don’t Tell Me Love Me' played 20 times a day.""

Gillis has remained busy with other musical projects. He's recorded background music for ESPN, the long-running TV game show ""The Price Is Right"" and even created the music for a couple of Tiger Woods golf video games.

“I played some 400 tracks for the last 20 years,"" Gillis said.

Gillis and a few other original members, including Keagy and Blades, will perform Night Ranger hits on stage Thursday in Bonita. The concert also may include some Damn Yankees (a late '80s ""super group"" that included Blades), and Alice Cooper and Ozzy tunes, Gillis said.

""It's been wonderful,"" he said of still performing for nearly four decades. ""We've noticed our crowds getting bigger every year. Classic rock is still viable and people want to see it.”

1420,"Bishop Verot graduate Daniel Vogelbach showing power, discipline for the Seattle Mariners","Seattle Mariners' Daniel Vogelbach hits a three-run double against the Chicago White Sox during the third inning of a baseball game in Chicago on Sunday. (Photo: Nam Y. Huh, AP)

Bishop Verot graduate Daniel Vogelbach has been forcing his way into the Seattle Mariners lineup this season thanks to his bat.

With his second inning home run Monday night against the Kansas City Royals, the 26-year-old became the first Mariners player to homer in four straight games since Mitch Haniger did so from April 20-23 last season.

That came a day after his big day Sunday when Vogelbach went 3-for-4 with two home runs, six RBI and two runs in a 12-5 victory against the White Sox. Vogelbach became the first Mariners player with three extra-base hits and six RBI since Franklin Gutierrez on June 17, 2016 at Boston. He became the 12th Mariner in club history to accomplish the feat.

In 17 at-bats through play Monday, the left-hander has already hit five homers, which is one more than he had last season in 87 at-bats.

But Vogelbach is not just hitting for power.

He also has two doubles, nine RBI and seven runs scored while hitting .471 (7-for-15) with six walks and five strikeots. In 2018, the 6-foot, 250-pound designated hitter/first baseman hit .207 with two doubles, nine runs, 13 RBI with 26 strikeouts and 13 walks.

Vogelbach spoke with 710 ESPN Seattle after Sunday's game and talked about his work at the plate.

“I’ve just been for the past couple days really trying to slow the game down. In the past when I’ve been up here, it’s been sped up a little bit. I’m just trying to get back to being myself and being the hitter that I’ve been my whole career through the minor leagues… (and I’m) finally starting to put together some good at-bats.”

He was also asked what it felt like to be hitting so well.

“It’s definitely a relief,"" Vogelbach said. ""But I mean, I’ve always believed that I could do it up here and I could do what I’ve done through the minors. So I just kind of trust myself and believe in myself to go every day, just knowing that eventually, it’s going to click if I continue to push and work at it.”",http://rssfeeds.news-press.com/~/600627124/0/ftmyers/home~Bishop-Verot-graduate-Daniel-Vogelbach-showing-power-discipline-for-the-Seattle-Mariners/,2019-04-09T08:56:26Z,The News-Press,Couple,"2442 Dr Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Fort Myers, FL 33901, USA",FL,33901
1421,Father wins civil suit against dance cult leader who drove to daughter suicide,"A heartbroken father spent six years and $500,000 in an international court battle to prove that his daughter’s Japanese guru, a master of the ‘dance of darkness,’ turned her into a sex slave, plied her with drugs and was responsible for her suicide.

Tibor Stern filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Katsura Kan, who was teaching Butoh, a form of dance in which students were told to ‘wallow in the darkness of their soul,’ at a college in Boulder, Colorado, according to the lawsuit.

Kan, whose real name is Terugoshi Kotoura and is believed to be aged 71, was found liable last month for the suicide of his student, Sharon Stern, by a Florida circuit court. A trial will take place in a few months to determine the damages.

Tibor Stern, 70, of Hollywood, Florida, described his victory as ‘bittersweet.’

‘I thought it would bring much more closure,’ he told DailyMailTV. ‘I had no doubt we were going to win; the evidence was overwhelming. But I didn’t jump for joy.’

‘Our daughter is not coming back. But hopefully our effort will save some lives. That was the whole idea.’

Katsura Kan did not respond to requests from DailyMailTV for comment.

Sharon Stern, whom her family affectionately called ‘Sharoni,’ was beautiful and talented, with a lifelong interest in dance and performance, Tibor said.

After graduating from the University of Miami in 2001, Sharon performed as an actress and comedienne, taught yoga and was an avid swing and blues dancer.

Sharon married Todd Siegel, a software engineer, in May 2007. The couple moved to Boulder, Colorado, where Sharon enrolled in the master of fine arts program at Naropa University.

That’s where Sharon encountered Katsura Kan, a Japanese citizen and guest artist who taught Butoh, the ‘dance of darkness.’

1422,Jury selection begins for man accused of kill wife,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Jury selection begins on Monday in the trial of Michael Haim. He’s accused of murdering his wife Bonnie in 1993. This was a case that had gone cold for more than 20 years, until a huge development at the couple’s north side home in 2014.

The couple's son, Aaron Fraser, was adopted to another family and the case remained unsolved with little progress until 2014 when Aaron Fraser had grown up and purchased his biological parents’ home.

He was renovating the property and digging in the backyard where he discovered a sack.

""I ripped the bag. And it was like, the words I said to Thad was like, 'Why would somebody bury a coconut in a bag?' It looked like a coconut shell. I had it in my hand. That had it. We looked back in the hole and seen teeth,"" Fraser told police in an interview.

""At that point in time, you could actually see like the top of the eye socket. And it was like this part of the head, the top half of the head. I set it back in the hole,"" said Fraser.

The discovery immediately attracted dozens of officers to the home and the criminal investigation was re-ignited. The skull was Bonnie Haim, Michael's wife. It led to Michael Haim’s arrest in North Carolina.

""This case just involves hundreds of individual circumstances spanning over the last 20-something years that we will put it together, and put it in front of a jury to seek justice for Bonnie Haim and her son Aaron,"" said former State Attorney Angela Corey.

Jury selection for the case begins Monday.

1424,Another arrest made in death of 16-year-old during alleged phone theft,"SEMINOLE COUNTY, Fla. - Another person was arrested Friday in connection with the death of a 16-year-old over the theft of an iPhoneX back in January, according to the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office.

Authorities took into custody 41-year-old Curtis Felcher for his alleged involvement in the death of 16-year-old Denim Williams back in January.

Felcher was arrested on an Orange County warrant.

Deandre Florence, 18, was arrested for his alleged involvement in March. He was charged with second-degree murder during the commission of a forcible felony.

Officers said that the preliminary investigation of the Jan. 2 shooting indicated Williams was trying to steal a phone from a married couple he and another person had agreed to purchase it from when the husband fired his gun at Williams in self-defense.

The couple said that they arranged the sale of the iPhone X, which was valued at $900, through the app Offer Up and went to an area near Polk and Jefferson streets around 11:50 a.m. Jan. 2 to make the sale.

According to the investigation, messages and phone calls on Florence's cellphone show he was told to steal the cellphone by another person identified in the report as BoBo. Detectives said Florence, BoBo and Williams were involved in a criminal street gang responsible for multiple robberies in the Parramore area in December.

While Williams and the victims were talking about the phone, Williams allegedly lunged for the phone and a struggle ensued, according to the arrest report. Florence left as Williams and the person selling the phone were fighting, detectives said.

The male victim said he was in fear for his life when he fired his gun, also believing that Williams was reaching for a gun. The couple left the scene and called 911 after the shooting to explain what happened.

1431,"The people behind Malört, the liquor Chicago loves to hate","Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Malört: it's a Chicago thing people love (to hate). Sold as ""medicinal"" liquor during prohibition, today the bitter booze is a right of passage. Meet the people bringing the legendary spirit back to its hometown, telling the story in their own words.

Tremaine Atkinson, CEO and Head Distiller, CH Distillery

I don't exactly remember my first shot of Malört, but it was about 20 years ago when I moved here. I have an old friend who is from here and he was like, 'oh you gotta have this, this is a Chicago thing, you'll love it.'

""It's a little bit like Chicago, that it's a little bit sweet, but it's mostly like a big fist.""

What I do remember is that reaction, which is: ""why?"" It's a little bit like Chicago, that it's a little bit sweet, but it's mostly like a big fist.

The story goes that during Prohibition, if Carl Jeppson got in trouble with the Feds, he would pour them a shot and then they would say, ""of course, no one would ever drink that for pleasure.""

Sam Mechling, Cultural Ambassador and ""Keeper of the Flame,"" Jeppson's Malört

Carl Jeppson was living in Chicago pre-Prohibition. He found out about a loophole in the Volstead Act, which is what enforced Prohibition, that you could sell medicinal alcohol. When Prohibition hit he was selling it borderline illegally door-to-door to the Swedish community.

He actually sold the company because in his mind he thought, ""what's the point of selling medicinal alcohol when regular booze is legal?"" No one's gonna want this, but he came to be pretty surprised with the fact that people had woven it into their culture so much that they still wanted it. It was very Chicago.

It became a tradition, especially within families. There's a gentlemen named Tony Izardo who would drink a shot of it at 4 p.m. every single day, because his dad used to do it every single day.

""For me, if I was a sommelier for example, I would say that it tastes like a baby aspirin, wrapped in grapefruit peel, bound with rubber bands and soaked in well gin. It kinda tastes like a Werther's Original that's already been inside an old man's mouth.""

There are a lot of different ways to enjoy Malört. It's kind of like why people watch a show like ""Twin Peaks,"" some people like it because on the surface it's a good show, some people are absolutely terrified of it because it's so weird. I think it's very interpretive.

For me, if I was a sommelier for example, I would say that it tastes like a baby aspirin, wrapped in grapefruit peel, bound with rubber bands and soaked in well gin. It kinda tastes like a Werther's Original that's already been inside an old man's mouth.

Tremaine Atkinson

I started CH in 2013 and we bought the Jeppson's Malört Company in 2018. We're only the fourth owners in 80 or 90 years.

Carl Jeppson sold Malört to George Brode, who started really making it into a company. George was a lawyer among other things, but George had a legal secretary named Pat (Gabelick), and Pat took care of him when he was older. And then when he passed away, he left the company to her.

When we started the distillery, I found out that it was made in Florida, and I thought ""oh that's not right, 'cause this is a Chicago thing.""

I just kept bugging Pat to say, ""Hey, we'll make it in Chicago for you."" I didn't even care about making any money on it, I just wanted to bring it back here. But she kept saying no. So about a year ago, I gave up on it. Then Sam (Mechling) called me, and said, ""she wants to sell the company."" And I said, ""oh, ok."" And he said, ""no, she wants to sell the company to you."" And I said, ""Oh!"" As soon as the possibility came up I was like, ""yeah, it's got to be part of our family.""

Nick White, CH Distillery

I am from Chicago, born and bred. I've maybe been out of the city two months total of my life.

I mean, Malört is such a treasured product. A friend of mine had to search hard and wide in Baltimore to see if he can get a bottle, and it was really hard because it was such small distribution.

""I finally had a taste and I saw for myself what it really was, and I was like, 'oh...' You're not gonna see me drink half a bottle in one night that's for sure.""

I finally had a taste and I saw for myself what it really was, and I was like, 'oh...' You're not gonna see me drink half a bottle in one night that's for sure.

Tremaine Atkinson

So the actual recipe for Jeppson's Malört is top secret, so we don't tell anybody what exactly is in it except we all know that there's, it's got wyrmwood in it. And it has alcohol in it. So, but that's about all we can really say.

The recipe is old, it was written down a long time ago and it probably just evolved over time and no one bothered to write down the changes

It took us a couple of months, we made countless test batches. And the protocol when you're tasting Malört, you do a shot. So you can imagine how many shots we did around here in testing the recipe. It was a true labor of love.

I feel like it's really kind of important to carry on the traditions of the brand, and the ethos of the brand. Because it's not a slick marketing campaign, corporate kind of spirit.

Sam Mechling

If you go back to the 60s and 70s, it was actually, it was actually doing really really well back then. And then it did kind of drop off. And so right around 2007, 2008 it was kind of a groundswell of people on the Internet, and it was a collection of Malört faces with the hashtag #MalortFace, and they were all so funny cuz it was Packers fans at tailgates, it was aunts and uncles. You know, so it was, the reactions were so classic.

Bartenders like Malört . We serve so many fruity shots and weak shots to our customers that we crave something stronger than that. It was Jägermeister back in the 90s, and then it was a big Jameson town, and kind of the next step up was your fernets and your Malört, and it kind of became like a badge of pride. It's our way of showing we're wise guys.

It's kinda like a litmus test for being a Chicagoan, because it does prepare you for the sweet and the bitter and all that.

Tremaine Atkinson

People who love Malört, they genuinely love it, they haven't been told to love it. They've come to love it themselves.

I mean people get, you know, tattoos of the Malört logo on their bodies. I mean we laugh about it, and it's important to us.

Nick White

Whether you just want to be very happy and warm about missing Chicago, grab a bottle of Malört that you love. Or you miss cleaning your car in the snow and the grime, and you just want something to be angry about, you grab a bottle of Malört you hate.",http://www.sflcw.com/2019/04/11/the-people-behind-malort-the-liquor-chicago-loves-to-hate/,2019-04-11T18:50:39Z,SFLcw,Couple,"500 E Broward Blvd #800, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, USA",FL,33394
1434,"Gators counting on Heggie, Buchanan up front","GAINESVILLE — Florida’s offensive line is aware of the elephant in the room: in Dan Mullen’s second year at the helm, the big men up front remain a significant work in progress.

Considering the Gators will look to replace all but starting center Nick Buchanan, it’s seemingly understandable for the offensive line to experience a considerable drop-off, and it’s an issue Florida’s coaching staff hasn’t shied away from in spring practice.

Offensive line coordinator John Hevesy spent nearly a half-hour addressing the unit at the conclusion of a recent practice and multiple Gators admitted it was the longest post-practice huddle they’ve experienced in their playing careers.

According to those huddled around Hevesy, it was much needed.

“We just need to do better in practice, improve every day. We got a lot of young guys, and even the older guys, we got to make strides, and that’s what we’re working on now,” said offensive lineman Brett Heggie, a former Mount Dora standout. “You always got to work on everything. That’s how I approach every day. Just to work on everything, but I’ve got a long way to go. And the older guys do. The younger guys have made big strides since they’ve been here ’cause they’re younger, but we got a lot of work to do. But we’ll do it. We’ll be all right.”

Buchanan, a redshirt senior who started at center last season for the Gators, concurred with his fellow lineman that expectations are high when it comes to their contributions this season.

“It’s up to me to make sure the young guys come and understand the sense of urgency that’s coming, that they have to step it up and play. It kind of reminds me of when I was a freshman, we signed like seven or eight offensive linemen, so now they bring a whole bunch,” Buchanan said. “So I know those guys are excited because they have an opportunity to play, but they have to understand the work, the time and the effort it takes to come out here and compete at a high level.”

As a result of the youth movement at hand, Florida’s offensive line has attempted to follow Hevesy’s lead in more ways than one as they develop, including embracing the youth instead of running from the reality.

“We respect it, we acknowledge it. Even on off days we come in, come in the film room or we just meet with each other. We just get like, 1, 2’s and 3’s, so like we just meet with each other, that group for the week and go over plays we need to work on,” said Heggie, who played in nine games in 2018. “We just have to grow together, it’s going to take time, it’s not going to come over one night. Everybody’s not just going to click on one day. We just got to grind every day, come after and just come together.”

As a redshirt junior, Heggie is one of the more established presences on UF’s inexperienced offensive line, yet that doesn’t mean the Mount Dora native comes with a significant amount of playing experience with which he can mentor Florida’s fresh faces.

For Heggie, who has suffered consecutive season-ending injuries after redshirting as a freshman, he must also focus on his health in order to contribute at the level Hevesy and Co. expect him to in 2019.

“I got a couple things going on, but I’ll be all right,” Heggie said of his health this spring. “Like I said, I got a lot of work to do, but I’m just working hard.”

If Florida hopes to fill the void left by offensive lineman Jawaan Taylor, considered the top tackle in the upcoming NFL draft, in addition to the departures of Martez Ivey, Fred Johnson and Tyler Jordan, it’s become clear they’ll need Heggie and Buchanan to take it to the next level before taking the field against the Miami Hurricanes.

“I’ve been here for five years. There’s been questions about the offensive line every year I’ve been here. So I try not to listen to all that,” Buchanan said. “It’s fun, man. You get to come out here, learn with new guys, three or four new freshmen coming in for this spring. You get to run with new guys, have fun with them. Just the journey, you’ve got to enjoy that.”",https://www.dailycommercial.com/sports/20190411/gators-counting-on-heggie-buchanan-up-front?rssfeed=true,2019-04-11T07:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,Couple,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
1437,10 rules for dating as a single parent,"Advertisement 10 rules for dating as a single parent Experts break down how to know if you're ready, how to meet right person Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Diving back into the dating world as a single parent can feel daunting — especially if you’ve been out of the dating scene for awhile. It’s common to worry about things like rejection, how your kids will react to a new partner or whether you’re even ready to have someone new come into your family’s life. Deb Laino, DHS, a Delaware-based relationship therapist and certified sex educator, says questions like ""What do I do with my kids?"" ""When do I introduce my kids?"" ""When do I have sex?"" and ""Do I want to be in a relationship again?"" are totally normal, too. Because of this, ""the idea of ‘getting back in the game’ can be tough,” says Les Parrott, Ph.D., psychologist and founder of BetterLove.com. “If that means taking your time, so be it. If that means getting some counseling or coaching first, do it. The toughest part is simply starting.”So when is the right time to start? Ahead, Laino, Parrott and more experts answer this plus nine more tips that will help you date again as the awesome single parent that you are: 1. Wait a year.Your best bet — for yourself and for your children — is waiting a calendar year after the end of your previous relationship to re-enter the dating scene. “After divorce, people can feel a little lost,” says Laino. By getting involved in things that interest you, you’re enabling yourself to find things that bring you joy on your own time. And who knows? You might even meet someone who shares those same interests. 2. Confront your own issues. Especially if you’re coming out of an unhealthy relationship, it's important to unpack what went wrong, how it may have affected you, and even how you may have contributed to the problem, says Laino. Otherwise, you’ll just carry those issues with you into your next relationship, and it’ll likely cause the same tension and stress. So if you struggled with communication in your past relationship, take your year off dating to work on connecting with others and vocalizing what's on your mind. If body image is an underlying issue for you, take steps to improve your own feelings of self-worth. It's also not a bad idea to bring a therapist on board, especially if you struggle with self-reflection, says Laino.3. Let go of guilt.When you first start dating as a single parent, you may wonder how your children will feel about you spending time with someone new or not being home as much. These feelings are all normal, but you can't let 'em hold you back.“You'll probably have some inner conflict — a desire to date and begin a new life with someone while simultaneously feeling some guilt or worry about the effects of dating on the children,” says Paul Coleman, Psy.D, a psychologist and author of ""Finding Peace When Your Heart Is in Pieces.""“The mistake is ping-ponging between those emotions as you try to justify dating on the one hand while worrying or feeling guilty on the other.”How to avoid this ping-ponging: Accept that your family life will, at times, be disrupted when you begin to date. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, especially if a positive addition is coming into your life.4. Know what you want.Before you even start meeting up with people, decide what exactly it is you’re looking for in a new partner. Start with what matters most to you — your values, for example, says Parrott. Then write them down. “Make a list of deal-makers and deal-breakers,” says Parrott. “Ten each. It may sound silly, but it works because you can then tell right away if a person is worth pursuing. Don’t rely on your feelings alone.”One thing that should definitely make the list? Tolerance. “They need to have a higher level of patience because sometimes it takes that when you have kids,” says Laino.5. Give online dating a chance.As a single parent, odds are you’re spending most of your free time running the kids to basketball practices and recitals — not hitting up the local bar. That’s why online dating could be a great place to start as you re-emerge into the dating world. The first thing to know: “Choose a reputable dating site, and don’t be afraid to pay for it,” says Parrott. Match.com and eHarmony are typically good bets for finding a real relationship — especially since they’re active with single parents, says Laino. Popular apps like Bumble and Hinge have become more common for dating, too. Once you've signed up, fill out the basics in your profile, upload a few recent pictures and ask a friend to review it and give you constructive feedback, says Parrott. Once you get the green light, start looking for matches, and do so regularly.“That means checking in at least every couple of days to see what kind of people are reaching out,” says Parrot. And if you do find someone worth meeting? Do so publicly, and always let a friend know what you’re doing. Just in case. 6. Be transparent with your kids.The anxiety of how your kids will react to you dating again is very real. But once again, it’s important to not let that fear cripple you from ever leaving the house without them. “Keep the communication channels open,” says Parrott. “That means chatting with your kids (at the appropriate age level) to let them know what you're doing. Don’t keep it a secret for fear they will feel weird about it. Allow them to talk about their feelings.”It’s also a good idea, especially if your kids are young, to explain to them what exactly dating is. Tell them that as adults, it's normal to meet someone and become friends for awhile. Sometimes it works out, other times it doesn’t, and it’s not a bad thing either way. “That’s really important, just in case it doesn’t work out,” says Laino.7. Be upfront that you're a parent. You don't have to share your whole life story on the first date, but when it comes to you being a mom or dad, the earlier you let your date know, the better. Laino brings up a good point: “What if you’re on a date and you have to leave because something happened to your kid?” she says. If you do need to take a call or cut the night short, know that as a single mom or dad — especially if you’re dating someone who doesn’t have kids — it’s completely OK to put your children first. The right new partner will completely respect that fact and be happy to be involved with your children, as well, says Coleman. 8. Be thoughtful about introducing someone to your kids.You want to make sure everyone is ready, and this starts with your kids. “Once the two of you are getting serious, your kids will know and, ideally, they’ll ask to meet your partner,” says Parrott. “If they don’t, hint about the idea and make it a mutual decision with you and your children.”The same goes for your partner. “Wait until it seems like the relationship is on solid footing, that a commitment is desired, that there is genuine love,” says Coleman. “Otherwise, you run the risk of the kids growing attached to someone who eventually leaves because the relationship was not strong enough to begin with.”9. Name any challenges upfront. Once you plan to introduce a new partner to your kids, be honest about your children’s habits and personalities. “If there are any problems brewing (acting out, poor school performance, and so on), state them clearly,” says Coleman. After all, if this person becomes a more permanent fixture in your and your children’s lives, they’ll take on an authoritative role with your children, which means you both need to be on the same page about the struggles the children are facing and how you as their parent choose to discipline them. That way, the new partner can follow those boundaries.10. Never, ever settle!One more time in case you were distracted: DON'T. SETTLE. “You're not less desirable because you are older or have children,” says Coleman. “A mature person won’t let those things interfere with really getting to know you and perhaps fall in love.”This starts on date one with a potential new partner. Remember those behaviors you would let roll off your back when dating as a 20-something, like a date picking you up late or constantly checking their phone at the dinner table? Those shouldn’t fly as a single parent.“If somebody doesn’t respect you, I think that’s an absolute big red flag, and it’s likely not going to change,” says Laino. Look for things early on that signal disrespect, like showing up late, telling you how to parent your kids or not listening to you while you speak. Bottom line: Like dating during any other part of your life, dating as a single parent will have its ups and downs. When you do meet someone great, it still won’t be perfect — and that’s OK. “It typically takes a long time for kids to get in sync with you and a new partner,” says Parrott. The road might feel bumpy at first, but once you do find balance, it will absolutely feel worth it — for both you and your family.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/single-parent-dating-advice/27103675,2019-04-10T20:36:00Z,WPBF-TV,Couple,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

1439,"Effort underway to study, memorialize 'unmarked cemetery' at Capital City Country Club","Buy Photo Jonathan Lammers, a historical preservation consultant, discusses the location of a burial site is believed to be at the Capital City Country Club with activist Delaitre Hollinger Tuesday, April 9, 2019. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

Armed with a couple of dated newspaper clippings, an archaeological site review from 1974 and fueled by a passion for preserving history, Delaitre Hollinger has found his next big challenge: bringing dignity to a neglected burial ground on the grounds of the Capital City Country Club.

The golf course was built on lands that once belonged to the Houstoun Plantation, originally owned by Edward Houstoun, and later by his son, Patrick. Research pinpoints the cemetery site on the Country Club Drive side, near where the 7th hole is today.

The site contains no headstones or markers. At one point in the early 70s, it was surrounded by a fence that is no longer there.

Hollinger’s quest has not gone unnoticed. He’s quickly established an informal network of preservationists, archaeologists, neighborhood leaders and engaged the historian of the country club.

They are working toward learning the truth, and if successful, dignifying those buried there with a historic marker, while unearthing a slice of history that until now has been forgotten.

Hollinger’s interest was piqued while appearing on a local radio program when a listener called in with a query about a possible slave cemetery. It immediately took him back to an Oct. 24, 2001, story published in the Tallahassee Democrat.

The late City Commissioner Charles Billings and former NAACP president Anita Davis brought the matter to the city’s attention. Billings, then-City Manager Anita Favors and others met with the club’s directors.

A 2001 historical survey indicated a cemetery once occupied a 200-square foot space that was part of the 15th green on the course. And, while some speculated slaves were buried there, others, including Davis, reasoned it could be a segregated private cemetery. That initial drive by Billings and Davis ended with the city promising to do more research.

Digging deeper, Hollinger discovered a four-paragraph story published in Jan. 28, 1971, in the Democrat, indicating the discovery of the cemetery by Florida State University anthropology student Joe Hutto. The late state archaeologist Calvin Jones said the graveyard was possibly a slave cemetery, but no dig was planned at the time.

Jones, who died in 1998, sketched out an archaeological form dated Feb. 2, 1974, describing a “black cemetery” on the “east side of Capital City Golf Course on Country Club Drive.”

His notes indicated “tee over part of cemetery.”

The city votes to review cemetery situation

Hollinger brought his concerns before the City Commission on Feb. 20, appealing for the placement of a marker on the Country Club Drive side of the course — emphasizing it’s been 18 years since Billings and Davis first brought it to the city’s attention.

“I think it’s high-time that on this city-owned property, there be some type of recognition given to the fact that there is a cemetery there containing the bodies of black people,” said Hollinger, executive director of The National Association for the Preservation of African-American History & Culture, Inc. and immediate past president of the Tallahassee branch of the NAACP.

(Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

Commissioners voted unanimously to have staff research the request at the urging of City Commissioner Elaine Bryant.

In response, City Attorney Cassandra Jackson reminded the board that although the city owns the property in Myers Park, the Capital City Country Club and Golf Course is regulated by its board. She said the agreement and the request would be reviewed.

After initially scheduling a tour of the site, Assistant City Manager Wayne Tedder changed gears when a local archaeologist, Barbara Clark, expressed interest in the project.

""I think we let the professionals do what professionals do and at the end of the day, she advises us on some work to be done and how to do it,"" he said.

Once that is determined, staff will report back to the commission.

Since the City Commission meeting, Hollinger has been contacted by Jay Revell, Capital City Country Club historian.

Revell, Hollinger, Clark, historian Jonathan Lammers, Jeffrey Shanks, an archaeologist with the National Parks Service's Southeast Archaeological Center, and Jason Bench, the club's general manager, toured the site Tuesday afternoon, but the Democrat was not invited to attend.

""It was a very good meeting,"" Revell said afterward. “After our site visit and consulting historical evidence there is consensus that an area on the course deserves further investigation. There are certain tests that would need to be done to better understand what may be there and the group has devised a potential path to do so.”

Hollinger said Clark was able to determine several depressions in the ground. He also was impressed that the site has been preserved by the club and not disrupted by golfers or their carts.

""It was agreed upon that we request the board members of the club and the city accept the ground penetrating radar services which would be offered free of charge by the National Parks Service,"" Hollinger said. ""We won't know for sure until we get ground penetrating radar (findings).""

'A statewide problem'

Clark, regional director for the North-Central Florida Office of the Florida Public Archaeology Network, said she won’t know more until she further studies the site.

“It is definitely a cemetery, that’s all I know,” said Clark, who has reviewed Jones’ report. “It’s what we call an ‘unmarked cemetery.' ""

Clark said the reality of unmarked graves is a “statewide problem,” but at the same time, state archaeologists have been doing “everything in their power” in protecting those sites.

“Leon County had a lot of plantations and there were lots of slaves,"" she said. ""It goes without saying there are cemeteries.”

Lammers, who has done extensive research on the Houstoun Plantation, also visited the site last week with local archaeologist Jim Miller and Hutto, a nationally known nature writer who has since moved back to the area.

Lammers said ""only about 15 depressions were visible, but the cemetery is likely much larger than that."" His research leads him to believe ""more than 100, mostly children"" could be buried there. But it is impossible to know without testing.

The history of the country club

The club dates back to 1908 when the original Tallahassee Country Club was founded on the grounds of the Grove near the Governor’s mansion.

In 1914, it moved to the new golf course built by George Perkins on the grounds of the old plantation in what is now Myers Park. The original golf course there was nine holes and was designed by English golfer named H.H. Barker.

The club purchased the land from Perkins in 1924 for $10,000. In 1936, the club struck an agreement with the city in which the land was given to the city for the purpose of expanding and maintaining the golf course for public use.

As part of that agreement, the city worked closely with the members to expand the golf course using funding from the Works Progress Administration. The expanded golf course operated as a municipal course for 20 years as a segregated club.

In 1956, a controversial decision was made for the city to lease the course back to the club. The city leased the course to the club for a period of 99 years at $1 per year. It is commonly recognized this was done to avoid desegregating the operation, which is no longer the case.

A new club, Capital City Country Club, was chartered, and the lease rights were given to the new club which has operated on the site since 1956.

The history of Capital City Country Club

It is open to the public and is part of the Florida Historic Golf Trail. A marker already exists at the entrance to the clubhouse on Golf Terrace Drive laying out the history of the golf course.

(Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

Revell said he is supportive of the idea of placing an additional marker on the Country Club Drive side of the course to provide the public with a complete history of the property.

“Any opportunity to paint the whole history of the property is important,” Revell said. “We are the only golf course located in the city’s only historic district (Myers Park) and it’s important to paint the full picture of the history of the area.”

Hollinger is encouraged by the support he's received in finding answers and hopefully, resolution, to a long-lost part of the city's history.

“There are many bodies buried (throughout the state) that we don’t know about,” Hollinger said. “This is not a unique situation, but one that we need to come in and correct.”

1444,New marathon hopes to promote West Volusia's trail system,"DEBARY — Between the Daytona Beach Half Marathon and the Tomoka Marathon and Half Marathon, Volusia County was already on its way to establishing itself as a destination for distance runners.

But the recently announced Central Florida Legends Marathon, Half Marathon and 5K, scheduled for Nov. 24, represents more than just another running event for the region.

West Volusia leaders hope this event will create interest in the area and highlight the extensive asphalt trail system that snakes through pristine Florida wilderness and that it's a spark for local ecotourism.

“This will showcase the trails,” said Stacy Flynn, president of West Volusia Runners (WVR), which has more than 300 members.

“People are really going to see the beauty of our area. Most events are done along the East Coast or around the ocean. This is going to focus on the trail and the connections they are making with the trail system.”

The cities of DeBary and Deltona are joining forces with the county, WVR and Runner’s High Racing to promote the marathon, which will serve as a Boston Marathon qualifier.

There are 23 marathons listed statewide this year, staged from Key West to Pensacola. The best known in Central Florida is the Walt Disney World Marathon, which was held in January.

Don and Stacy Stoner, who own Runner’s High Racing which manages race events, believe this area is perfect for a family-oriented community sporting event thanks to the massive trail system.

“There are a lot of races on the east side of the county, a lot of focus, but not as much here,” Don Stoner said. “But there are so many beautiful areas with Blue Springs, DeLeon Springs, Gemini Springs, there’s a lot to be seen. It would be nice to see more events brought over here especially now that we’ve got the infrastructure to support it and the trails to highlight it.”

The construction of these West Volusia trails began 20 years ago. According to the Volusia County website, there are more than 25 miles of 12-foot-wide asphalt trail with the goal of creating 50 miles of this system stretching from Deltona to Edgewater.

There are currently two main trails — a Spring-to-Spring Trail, from DeLeon Spring to Green Springs, and the Rail Trail, which runs east to west from Gemini Springs past Osteen.

Danny Ron, who is a WVR vice president and works for the City of Deltona, ran point on pulling the pieces together for a marathon. The process of putting together a coalition to support the race began more than a year ago.

“The cities said they wanted to put together a race representing the West Volusia side,” Ron said. “That’s when I approached the Stoners and they had a vision of putting a race in this area. We reached out to DeBary and little by little we started adding all these elements.”

Roger VanAuker, DeBary’s economic development director, said he jumped onboard shortly after being presented the concept because of the uniqueness of the trails.

""A lot of trail systems go through industrial areas or commercialized areas,"" he said. ""We have Old Florida. Maybe this kicks off as a one-day event and grows to a two-day event. We hope so.”

Stacy Stoner, who lives in DeBary with her husband, said the area wants to be known for something other than being commuter cities for Orlando.

“We hope to pull runners from Orlando and Jacksonville to see what is here,"" she said. “People from Orlando drive right past here to go to the beaches. We want them to stop and see what we have here.”

The course, which has yet to be certified, will run from Gemini Springs east through Deltona to six miles past Osteen and back again. On the outbound run there is a scenic, two-mile notch overlooking Lake Monroe. There are a few steps involved in attaining certification.

“It’s a detailed process,” Don Stoner said. ““It takes a couple of days to measure the course and a couple more days to do the paperwork and get it submitted. Once USA Track and Field approves it, it’s listed on their website as a certified course. Certification is usually good for 10 years.”

And for those looking for a ticket to Boston, Don Stoner predicts this will be a fast course.

“This course is runner friendly,” he said. “The advantage of the trails is that it is scenic, beautiful and safe for competitors. There are some minor grades up and down but it’s a relatively fast course. We will see a lot of really good times.”",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190407/new-marathon-hopes-to-promote-west-volusias-trail-system?rssfeed=true,2019-04-07T15:43:09Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
1445,FSU's Bobby and Ann Bowden celebrate 70 years of marriage,"CLOSE The unveiling of an honor for the Bandit at FSU. Jim Henry, Democrat sports editor

Give-and-take.

That’s Bobby and Ann Bowden’s golden rule to having a long and happy marriage.

Communication and laughter are important, too.

The legendary Florida State football coach and his wife celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary on Monday, April 1. The couple has lived in the same brick house in Killearn Estates that Ann fell in love with in 1976 when Bowden was hired at FSU. Their lives remain intertwined with Tallahassee, where Bowden built the Seminoles into a dynasty and life after FSU has been relaxing and enjoyable.

The childhood sweethearts from Birmingham, Alabama, raised six children and yearly reunions held at their beach house in Panama City now features more than 40 family members.

Life is good.

“Marriage is give-and-take,” said Bowden, who turns 90 in November. “I don’t think one of you needs to dominate. You give into her some, and she gives into you some. It’s not a one-way street.”

Bowden and Ann married on April 1, 1949. Bobby was 19 years old. Ann Estock was 16. Bowden borrowed $20 from a friend and the couple drive 120 miles from Birmingham to Rising Fawn, Georgia. They were married at the home of the town’s Justice of the Peace and kept it a secret from family and most friends early on.

The rest is history, 70 years… and counting.

The couple is proud of their martial milestone, one that Bowden considers important due to a divorce rate this hovers around 40 to 50 percent in the United States.

“When we were as young as we were when we married, there was jawing back and forth as you expect. I told Bobby as you’ve gotten older, he’s really gotten sweeter,” Ann said and laughed. “We’ve been fortunate. It’s really a good time of life and we are blessed. We have a large family and enjoy being around each other. We have our health. We don’t have to worry about our next paycheck or whether we win our next game or not.”

Bowden remains active, but he is a creature of habit – early to bed, early to rise.

He usually heads to his bedroom around 8 p.m. and wakes up around 4 a.m. He relishes that time in the mornings as reads the Bible with a cup of coffee, skims through a book and the newspaper. He also has joined the digital crowd, checking and answering emails. When in town and the weather is nice, Bowden walks and hits golf balls at Killearn Country Club behind his home. Ann said she stopped cooking when the youngest of their children moved out, so the couple usually heads to dinner around 4 p.m. to beat the crowd.

Their anniversary dinner was, well, a late afternoon on the town.

“It wasn’t a big deal – we gave each other a big hug,” Ann said.

While Bowden doesn’t travel nearly as much as he once did, he still speaks to businesses, clubs, schools and churches, telling football stories and quoting from scripture. Friday night, he attended the Pillars of Champions unveiling and ceremony honoring Burt Reynolds at the Champions Club at Doak Campbell Stadium. Bowden signed autographs, posed for photographs and was a featured speaker at the event.

Though Bowden doesn’t plan to attend the Seminoles’ annual spring game Saturday at Doak Campbell Stadium, he is pulling for second-year coach Willie Taggart. Taggart and FSU are looking to rebound from last year’s 5-7 mark – the program’s first losing season since Bowden’s initial year in Tallahassee.

“The big thing is you want to see improvement,” Bowden said. “I think everyone is pulling for Willie Taggart. I know I am.”

The Bowdens are headed to their beach home in Panama City Sunday. Bowden will play in a golf tourney Monday, just like he has for the past 25 years, to help raise money for FSU’s regional campus in Panama City. They will return to Tallahassee Monday night.

Life goes on.

Ann also hinted at a party to celebrate the couple’s 75th wedding anniversary in 2024.

“If we make it,” Ann said and laughed. “We plan to be there.”

1446,Couple wants sentimental ottoman returned,"LAND O' LAKES, Fla. (WLFA) - A couple dropped off their sentimental ottoman at a repair shop in October. Nearly six months later, they can't get it back, and they fear it's gone forever.

It was a gift from their son, Jimmy. He died young from kidney disease complications.

The ottoman is a reminder of his love and it's supposed to be sitting in their living room.

But instead, the best case scenario is that it's at Marine Motorcycle & Aviation Upholstery where it was dropped off for repair nearly six months ago.

""My grandson plays on it, he did a little rip, and we needed it fixed,"" Marilyn Tamborello said.

It was supposed to be simple. The couple paid a $200 cash deposit.

It was supposed to be finished in 10 days, but Thanksgiving came and went, and then came excuses.

""I mean he was sick, his grandmother passed away,"" Tamborello said.

""Then he literally called us up and said it was prepared, like today, and we said, 'Okay, can we come get it now?' And [he] says, 'No, tomorrow morning, but call me before you come.'""

Better Call Behnken reached the owner by phone and he said he's been busy. He said he was planning to return the ottoman this week but has had personal problems.

He hung up and refused to answer questions. The couple say he called them to say he would ""think"" about returning the ottoman after he saw our news story on TV.",https://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/better-call-behnken/couple-wants-sentimental-ottoman-returned/1903103195,2019-04-06T01:33:20Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

1449,Pompano Beach man accused of trying to carjack couple in Boca Raton,"Police say James Friedman tried to carjack a couple in Boca Raton, shooting at the car before running away.

BOCA RATON, Fla. - A Pompano Beach man is wanted in connection with a shooting and attempted carjacking in Boca Raton.

Boca Raton police spokesman Mark Economou said James Friedman tried to steal a couple's car Wednesday afternoon in the 900 block of North Federal Highway.

The driver told police he was in his car while his wife got out and was walking toward a building when a gunman emerged from some nearby bushes and fired a shot at the closed driver's side window. He tried to steal the car but soon ran away.

Economou said Friedman, 59, was identified as the suspect. Friedman is believed to have left in his pickup truck before switching to a red and black 2008 Kawasaki motorcycle with Florida license plate MEI I38.

Anyone with information about Friedman's location is asked to call 911.

The team wasn’t the same and the numbers weren’t the same.

With Lincoln’s girls basketball team graduating five seniors from a regional final team that went 22-2 and reached the Class 8A state tournament for the first time, the reins of the program were firmly handed over to Lincoln sophomore Erin Turral.

Turral, who was the All-Big Bend Player of the Year as a freshman while leading the state in scoring at 29 points per game, only had her twin sister’s returning experience to help her.

Buy Photo Lincoln's Erin Turral goes up for a layup as the Trojans' girls basketball team beat Niceville 72-68 during a Region 1-8A semifinal on Feb. 19, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Then five games in, Erica Turral tore her ACL, leaving Erin as the explosive, experienced player of a brand new, inexperienced group.

Yet Turral upped her average to 34.4 points per game, scored an area-record 60 points during a December game, and had 12 games of 40 or more points. Included is five straight games at the end of the regular season and three games in the postseason while leading the Trojans back to the regional finals and surprisingly close to reaching state again.

For the second straight season, Turral is the All-Big Bend Player of the Year in girls basketball.

“I’m just staying humble and trying to get better,” Turral said. “This year, it was a little more work. I felt like last year was easier, but this year I had to put in more work. When my sister went down, I had to step up. My team needed be and I had to play a bigger role.”

With every opposing coach and player focused squarely on stopping Turral, she still managed to torch defenses. Man-to-man, full deny, 3-2 zone, box-and-1, triangle-and-2 – she succeeded against them all.

“When teams tried to do that, we went over it in practice and went through scenarios so when we saw it in the game it was easier to break it,” Turral said. “And then score.”

Turral was also named the Dairy Farmers Class 8A Player of the Year for the second straight season. Of her 27 games, in only one game did she score below 20 points – a tournament defeat to the No. 2 team in Tennessee, Riverdale (31-2).

She followed that game up with a 53-point output two days later. Then one week after that, on Dec. 28, she set the all-time area mark of 60 points by hitting 13 of 20 3-pointers.

“During the week, I put up a lot of shots so I can be consistent in the game,” Turral said. “Before the game, I’ll shoot under the goal with both hands and get the flick of my wrist. I’ll do 10 from each side and then the middle. Then I back up mid-range and do 10 of them. I like to do makes. It makes me be consistent.”

While Turral carried her team at times, she also helped coax them along. She showed trust by passing to open shooters when double-teamed. In a regional semifinal win, after going for 24 points in the first half, she finished with 40 points. And it was because her teammates played with Turral’s same level of confidence.

“One of the bigger things I saw was growth in communication,” Lincoln head coach Rod Mack said. “She was quieter last year. Maybe because of our five seniors she felt her voice wasn’t needed. This year, I saw her in practice and in games where she picked up her leadership vocally.”

Said Turral: “From the beginning to the end, the team got better, more focused and more serious. It was a big help.”

Already over 2,000 points for her career while winning two state titles in middle school at FAMU DRS and then leading the Trojans to the state tournament last year, Turral could shatter area scoring records over the next two seasons.

And no one may reach them again.

“She still fights and goes hard and continues to try to get better and learn,” Mack said. “That’s the attribute I like – no matter the trial, good or bad – she wants to be better than the last play, the last game or the last season. That’s exciting to know she has two more years. I want to see how she grows.”

NFC’s Jones scratches out Defensive POY

On full-court press defense, North Florida Christian senior guard Caylan Jones usually guarded the inbounder.

She’d wave her arms, jump around, cause a deflection, grab a steal, and go right back up with it for quick points.

If a team got its passes over half court, Jones was charged with sprinting back to be in position as the Eagles’ primary rebounder. And then she’d bring the ball up the court, drive to the basket which usually resulted in a layup, and then do it all over again.

After averaging 26.7 points, 8.9 rebounds and 2.8 steals per game, while recording eight double-doubles, Jones has been named the 2019 All-Big Bend Defensive Player of the Year in girls basketball.

“It means I did what I wanted to do,” Jones said. “I got out there and put in the hustle, was able to help my teammates, and that put myself in a position to even be up for this award. Knowing I was able to do it with such great teammates and a great coach and get as far as we did, it was a great experience.”

(Photo: Photo Illustration by: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

In 15 of her 19 games, Jones had five or more offensive rebounds. Ten games resulted in three or more steals. And she did all the dirty work while also being relied upon to put the ball in the basket with a remaining roster of significant youth and inexperience.

Jones, who was also named Dairy Farmers Class 3A Player of the Year, helped NFC come within six points of knocking off FAMU DRS in the regional final. A 2,000-point scorer for her career, Jones had 27 points, 11 rebounds, and four steals in her final high school game. She also had two 39-point games this season.

“It’s the hustle I have for the game,” Jones said. “I have teammates and we’re hustling. If I put my 100 percent in, they’ll put their 100 percent in. If I do my part, I’ll help the team go better than what it is. I just know I have to give it everything I have and that’s how I go after the games.”

Buy Photo NFC senior Caylan Jones scored 35 points as NFC's girls basketball team beat Maclay 72-56 on Jan. 31, 2019. (Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

Rarely a jump-shooter, Jones made her living offensively by driving through bodies, taking contact, and being willing to get her points at the line if necessary.

And oftentimes, it was her defense – jumping passing lanes in the half court, grabbing a rebound and going coast-to-coast, leading full-court press – that ignited hers and her team’s offense.

“A lot of scratches. I always come out with scratches and bruises,” Jones said. “Of course, there’s bumps and bruises, but that’s basketball. That’s how it’s played. I didn’t have a mindset that I’d get hurt, it was more that I had to do what I came onto the floor to do. There’s stuff in the way, but I had to go through it.

“I have to thank God for giving me a healthy body to do what I do, and I have to thank my mom and dad. They were the ones that said I can’t be soft when I go out there. I have to go 100 percent, be tough, and lay it all on the floor.”

Jones’ biggest highlight came her junior season when she went for 39 points, eight rebounds and six assists in a 66-62 win over FAMU DRS to capture a district title and end the Rattlers’ two-decade district-title streak.

“It was a great experience,” Jones said. “These five years, I’ll definitely take it with me. I’ll probably be way older and remember my high school years. The teammates I have, the coach I have, the memories, the laughs we had, it just makes it all memorable. The accomplishments along the way made it even more memorable.”

Rickards’ Davis earns second Coach of the Year

For 11 years, Chariya Davis has been head coach of Rickards’ girls basketball team, and for 11 consecutive years the Raiders have been district champs.

During that stretch, the Raiders also made the state final four twice.

But this season, Rickards’ consistency yielded a program first. Its senior class became the first to win 20 or more games for four consecutive seasons.

With a 22-9 record and a season that ended in the regional finals, a play away from reaching state again, Davis has been selected as the All-Big Bend Coach of the Year. It’s her second time receiving the honor, the first time being 2013.

“I’ve never been into accomplishments and awards, but they tend to hit me years later,” Davis said. “It’s just doing what I love to do and trying to help the girls on and off the court. It recognizes the hard work that coaches put in. Oftentimes it’s unnoticed and unappreciated.”

Perhaps the consistency of Rickards’ program has been unappreciated as well. Davis’ career record stands at 234-86. That’s an average of 21-8 for 11 straight seasons.

This year, despite having graduated two starters that provided 25 points and 13 rebounds per game – including 2017 Player of the Year Tamia Riles – Rickards still put together a season that saw it split with Florida High and Lincoln, top FAMU DRS, and beat Leon twice, Chiles twice, Gadsden County twice, and Godby three times.

“We did face a lot of adversity,” Davis said. “People see the results on the court but not everything we go through as a team and overcome. We battled injuries the last two years. It says a lot about the young ladies. People say I get all the talent, but I don’t have an All-American type. We have different pieces of the puzzle and we work together and try to collectively have success.”

Rickards had all five of its starters selected to All-Big Bend teams – point guard Iyanla Woodfaulk (first team), forward Renia Hawkins and guard Keshonda Gaskins (second team), and guards LaNiyah Lee and Denia Love (honorable mention). All five are seniors that had been playing together since freshmen.

After losing in the regional finals their first two seasons to national No. 1 Jacksonville Ribault, the Raiders were stunned in the second round last year.

In the regional final against Bishop Kenny, the Raiders and Knights traded baskets in the fourth quarter. Rickards was down 55-53 with one minute to play, saw a couple shots rim out, and ultimately lost by six.

“This group, they had four years of experience and had been through the ups and downs of the postseason,” Davis said. “To finish on that note speaks volumes for their four years. It’s all you can ask of your team and seniors in that moment to go out and lay everything out there. It was our best game of the season.”

1460,2 Polk couples recount harrowing ordeal aboard Viking Sky cruise ship trapped off coast of Norway,"Mark Hofstad and Carol Burlingham of Lakeland and Dale and Marcia Smith of Winter Haven were among 1,373 passengers and crew members aboard the Viking Sky cruise ship that made international headlines.

LAKELAND — Two Polk County couples shared the harrowing experience of being trapped off the coast of Norway while howling winds, rain and 26-foot waves battered their drifting cruise ship.

Mark Hofstad and Carol Burlingham of Lakeland and Dale and Marcia Smith of Winter Haven were among the 1,373 passengers and crew members aboard the Viking Sky cruise ship that made international headlines in late March when its engines failed and the ship narrowly averted striking the rocky Norwegian coast.

Remarkably both couples heaped praise instead of recriminations on the company and the ship's crew weeks later when sharing their experiences with The Ledger.

“The bottom line is that we viewed this as an adventure,” said Hofstad, 67, who retired as a judge on the 10th Judicial Circuit Court in Bartow in January after seven and a half years on the bench. “We probably would not cruise any other cruise line.”

Burlingham and the Smiths agreed.

“We were and still are Viking supporters; we're advocates,” said Dale Smith, 70, who retired as the Winter Haven city manager in 2013 after 37 years with the city.

The positive feedback came even after both women compared their experiences to probably the most famous cruise ship disaster, the 1912 sinking of the Titanic.

“That's when I got scared. It was like the Titanic,” said Marcia Smith, 67, the retired nutrition director for Polk County Schools, describing her feelings at a crucial point. “Even though it was a harrowing experience, the way we were treated proved we made the right choice.”

The following is a capsule version of events based on the accounts of all four people supplemented by news media reports.

'In Search of the Northern Lights'

Swiss-based Viking, which offers river and ocean cruises mostly on European waters, advertised this trip on its 4-year-old ocean liner, Sky, under the title “In Search of the Northern Lights.”

A Minnesota native who briefly resided in Alaska, Hofstad knew the Northern Lights well, but his wife did not.

“I had never seen them. I'm a Florida girl,” said Burlingham, 65, who retired in 2016 as an assistant state attorney after 27 years at the 10th Circuit.

The Smiths also took the cruise because they had never encountered nature's light show.

The Sky set sail March 14 from Bergen, Norway, and passengers saw the Northern Lights a couple nights later.

But the ship ran into a storm on Friday night, March 22, and into the next morning while sailing off the Norwegian coast.

Sailing was “a little choppy, but not what you wouldn't expect,” Burlingham said.

The weather calmed down after dawn Saturday, but around noon it sailed into another storm with wind gusts up to 43 mph and waves of more than 26 feet, according to Norwegian media sources.

Dale Smith could see the seas churning as the couple ate lunch, he said.

“I'm an engineer, and I could measure them. They were 25 feet,” said Smith, who holds a civil engineering degree.

Shortly after noon, all four local passengers agreed they could hear that the engines had shut down. The Sky also lost all power except for emergency lighting.

Then furniture started sliding across the decks.

Hofstad was in the Explorations Lounge on one of the top decks. All the furniture, save for a piano bolted to the floor, started sliding around and bottles and glasses were tumbling from the shelves, he said.

“It got rough, and it got progressively more rough,” Hofstad said.

By then the Smiths had returned to their cabin, where they and the furniture also were buffeted about.

“You could hear the glass breaking and bathroom things were falling off the shelves,” Dale Smith said.

At one point, an apparently big wave hit and flung him across the cabin.

“I went across the room and hit a door,” said Dale Smith, who was not injured. “When the next wave hit, it took the bed against the closet. All the furniture shifted to one side of the room.”

Then an alarm sounded, and passengers were told to proceed to their assigned assembly, or “muster,” areas that they knew from drills before the ship sailed. The more than 900 passengers were divided between two muster areas.

Both couples went to the same muster area, a large dining hall on one side of the ship.

'It was very Titanic-like'

Up to that point, the Smiths, Burlingham and Hofstad agreed they were concerned but not frightened. All four credited the calmness of the crew with preventing a general panic.

That Titanic moment came in the muster area.

A wave crashed into that side of the ship, blowing a metal door off its hinges. That apparently triggered a sensor that automatically opened the windows, which would have provided an escape route but let more water in, Dale Smith said.

“I heard a great big bang, and all of the sudden a wall of water was coming through. It was very Titanic-like,” said Burlingham, who was with Hofstad at the front of the hall near the doorway.

The water knocked many people off their feet and sent them sliding across the floor toward the other end of the hall, Hofstad and Burlingham said.

“When the water came in, there was a lot of screaming,” Hofstad said.

Burlingham got pinned against a wall by a sliding table and couldn't breathe, she said.

“I got it away from me to the point where I could breathe, but I didn't dare push it forward because people were under it,” Burlingham said.

The Smiths were at the other end of the hall, where they could see and hear the incident, but they escaped the surging water because most of it went down a stairwell in front of them. Still both reported feeling the premature end of their cruise was nigh.

“That's when I thought we were going to sink,” Dale Smith said. “My only concern was that I couldn't say good-bye to my kids.”

“We took each other's hands and said (silently), 'This is it,' ” Marcia Smith said.

But the couples agreed the room quickly calmed down after the incident, again crediting the crew's calm reaction.

“Then things settled down, and there was no panic after that,” Hofstad said.

“Everyone was calm. There was no stampeding,” Dale Smith said. “There wasn't any yelling; there wasn't any screaming; there wasn't any pushing. Everyone was orderly. It confirmed your faith in humanity.”

In short order, passengers moved from the muster area into an adjoining hallway behind another water-tight door. Eventually they would be evacuated by helicopter.

The evacuation became another ordeal itself.

'Go toward the light'

The Smiths said they thought the helicopters would land on the ship or passengers would be lifted up in a large basket. Instead, the Norwegian Coast Guard evacuated one by one, fitting each passenger with a harness attached to a steel cable that was hoisted up to the helicopter.

Only about half the passengers chose that option.

“If we had time to think about it, we probably wouldn't have done it,” Marcia Smith said.

The seas were still choppy, the ship swaying and the helicopter had to move with it to keep the cable in place until a passenger could be hooked up. The noise from the sea and helicopter eliminated any conversations, and Coast Guard seaman communicated through eye and hand gestures.

Both couples also praised the professionalism of the Norwegian Coast Guard under such dangerous conditions.

“Those guys knew what they were doing. They were focused,” Dale Smith said.

The Smiths said they spent four hours on the ship until the airlift.

Hofstad and Burlingham estimated they spent six hours, which meant they were evacuated after nightfall. A high-powered lamp from the bottom of the helicopter provided the only illumination.

On the way up, Burlingham said, “I kept thinking: Go toward the light. Go toward the light.”

The couples also rained effusive praise on the Norwegian people, who cared for them once they made it to land and into hotels. The Norwegian Red Cross gave each person about $300 in local currency to buy new clothes, personal items and other needs. Viking paid for hotel rooms.

Viking also refunded the cost of the cruise, about $10,000 each depending upon accommodations, side trips and other variables, and gave every passenger vouchers for two free additional cruises in the future.

“Those people in Norway are the salt of the earth,” Marcia Smith said. “I hope some day we get the chance to go back to the community and thank them personally.”

1461,Zalak running for clerk of court,"Second candidate for that office

Marion County Commissioner Carl Zalak is running for clerk of court and comptroller.

Zalak and fellow Republican Greg Harrell are the only ones so far who have filed to run for the office, which will be on the 2020 ballot. A political newcomer, Harrell has been general counsel at the clerk’s office for six years.

Clerk of Court David Ellspermann announced last year he would not seek a seventh term.

Zalak was voted onto the commission in 2010 and has firmly held the District 4 seat since. His quest for the clerk’s office means he will need to resign his commission seat, and Gov. Ron DeSantis will appoint a commissioner for District 4 as early as January 2021, said Wesley Wilcox, Marion County's supervisor of elections. Zalak will need to submit his resign-to-run letter — irrevocable — to Wilcox by June 5, 2020.

That also means there is a potential for changes in four of the five County Commission seats in 2020. In District 1, Commissioner David Moore is not running for re-election because he is running for property appraiser. Three people already have filed to run for that seat. Meanwhile, incumbents Jeff Gold and Michelle Stone already have filed to run for re-election for commission districts 3 and 5, respectively.

“After much prayer, I am stepping out on faith in order to follow God’s call: serving the hardworking taxpayers of Marion County in a new role,” Zalak wrote in a prepared statement on Monday. “I respect the relationship between the Board of County Commissioners, the clerk’s office and, most importantly, the citizens we serve. I am uniquely qualified to keep this partnership in total alignment with no exceptions and no excuses.”

Zalak said the magnitude of the clerk’s office on taxpayers is one of the best-kept secrets in local government.

“The clerk is the county’s chief budget and finance officer,” he noted. “Serving on the Board of the County Commissioners, I quickly learned how vital having a name you can trust at the bottom of every check is for a transparent, accountable and efficient government.”

On the County Commission, Zalak has been an outspoken voice on budget and land-use issues. A Marion County resident since 2000, he owns Busy Bee Waste Services and has a degree in management information systems from the University of South Florida.

Zalak said Tuesday he had not planned to seek another term on the county commission. Then Ellspermann announced he would not seek another term as clerk.

“I guess that started a conversation with a lot of folks who know me, such as community leaders in town,"" he said. ""I know it’s hard to run for more than a couple terms (as commissioner), but we’re moving in the direction we want to. We’re building World Equestrian Centers, we’re getting interchanges in, we’re recruiting companies that are incredible. Our community is on the move and on the march.”

He said people recommended he run for clerk, citing his reputation as a budget hawk. Zalak also said his grasp of technology and background would be a good fit in moving the clerk’s office forward in the future.

The clerk and comptroller serves a four-year term and is paid $145,550 annually. County commissioners are paid $83,048 per year.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190409/zalak-running-for-clerk-of-court?rssfeed=true,2019-04-09T13:24:42Z,Ocala.com,Couple,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471
1462,"Brent Batten: Hooray for Hollywood, back as part of the Naples entertainment scene","Those still awaiting roof repairs or battling insurance companies over claims may dispute this, but by at least one measure, we can now officially put Hurricane Irma behind us.

One of the most visible casualties of the Sept. 10, 2017, storm — the Hollywood 20 Cinema — has reopened.

The darkened theater served as a constant reminder of the hurricane’s damage.

Sure, power was restored, utilities were back on line and roads were open within a few days or weeks.

Debris removal took a couple of months, and it took a while longer than that for crews to get to all the screen cages and carports.

But for the most part, life returned to normal by the one-year anniversary.

Except for that movie theater. Its darkened facade stood as a testament to the ferocity of Irma.

It’s been apparent for a while that the operators were doing more than just patching the roof and replacing the carpet.

The closing has given Regal Cinemas the opportunity to remake the Hollywood 20 into a more modern facility.

Following the lead of other movie houses, it now features user kiosks for buying tickets, a bar and reclining chairs.

Those additions put it on a par with Silverspot Cinema at Mercato and the Paragon at the Pavilion Shopping Center.

But after so many months out of commission, Hollywood 20 could use an extra boost to lure back customers who’ve grown accustomed to going elsewhere for their movie fix.

How about an Irma-inspired film festival?

CLOSE Hollywood 20 in North Naples is targeted to reopen soon with some major changes. Tim Aten, tim.aten@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4857

There’s no shortage of movies that could tell the story of the theater’s closing and subsequent reopening.

2017: Some local movie screens remain dark since Hurricane Irma

For starters, take your pick of “Hurricane,” a 2018 film about fighter pilots in World War II, or 1999’s “The Hurricane,” starring Denzel Washington as the boxer Rubin Carter.

Film festivals are known for showing movies that were loved by critics but didn’t go over big with the public. In that vein, “Eye of the Storm,” from 2011 starring Geoffrey Rush would be a good candidate.

No film festival would be complete without a foreign contribution, so we present “After the Storm,” a 2016 product of Japan.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

The classics are an important part of a film festival, and what better movie than “Gone with the Wind,” to depict what Hollywood 20 management saw when they returned the day after the storm to look at their theater.

Come to think of it, “The Day After” would be a nice fit, too.

Motorists traversing Naples Boulevard these past 18 months couldn’t help but notice the lack of lighting and evening activity at the once-bustling movie palace. For them, a showing of “The Dark Knight.”

Since the hurricane, crews have been busy getting the building not just back to where it was, but to its new, technologically advanced form.

In honor of that effort, the community is invited to a screening of “Transformers.”

So, while the Hollywood 20 is remade into a state-of-the-art facility with all the bells and whistles, it’s still a familiar old friend returning to the Naples entertainment scene.

1463,Blue Wahoos start strong on mound during opening weekend,"Griffin Jax continued the season-opening mastery by Pensacola Blue Wahoos starting pitchers, but Sunday became the first without a desired ending.

The Mobile BayBears got a walk-off hit from Roberto Pena in the 11th inning for a 2-1 victory to end the Blue Wahoos (3-1) perfect start at Mobile's Hank Aaron Stadium.

The final score was Mobile's first time in the lead the entire weekend.

""The offense unfortunately was not good,"" said Blue Wahoos manager Ramon Borrego after the game. ""We had a couple chances with runners in scoring position, but didn't do any damage. But you know, that's baseball. We have been playing really good.""

This was the second extra-inning game of the series. Under the minor league rules adopted before the 2018 season, all extra inning, regular-season games begin with a runner on second base. The Blue Wahoos twice stranded their runner on third in the 10th and 11th.

Well before the game reached that point, Jax, an Air Force Academy graduate, had kept the BayBears in check. He stranded baserunners in all five innings he worked, before exiting with a 1-0 lead.

It's been four games with four terrific lines for the Blue Wahoos' starters. They have combined for a 0.45 earned run average, allowing just one run in 20.0 innings. The foursome recorded 26 strikeouts. They've allowed just one run and 12 hits in four games.

""I'm just so happy right now with the pitching staff, especially the starters,"" Borrego said. ""Griffin was great. He gave us a really solid outing, but unfortunately we didn't back it up with offense.""

After the Blue Wahoos missed a scoring chance in the ninth, reliever Dusten Knight, who got the extra-inning save Friday night, returned to throw a pair of scoreless innings. He retired Mobile in order in the ninth, then worked out of a bases-loaded, one out situation in the 10th with a strikeout and a ground out to force another inning.

The Blue Wahoos scratched across their only run in the fifth after an infield single from Drew Maggi, who went to second on an error, moved to third on a ground out, and beat a throw to the plate on a fielder's choice grounder.

Unlike the past four games, the Blue Wahoos did not manage an extra base hit and finished with only four hits in the game.

Even after the loss, Borrego was positive about the team's outlook and 3-1 start.

""This weekend has been fantastic for us,"" Borrego said. ""It is our first year in Pensacola and so far I like how our guys compete...pitching, offense, defense. When we match all that together you will have a really good game.""

Right hander Sean Poppen will try to complete the trend in the series finale Monday night at 6:35 PM in Mobile. After that, the focus will turn to Wednesday's highly anticipated home opener against Jacksonville at Blue Wahoos Stadium.

Looking ahead for the Blue Wahoos, they will have an off day on Tuesday before their home-opening debut Wednesday at 6:35 PM in Blue Wahoos Stadium against the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp. It will begin a new era in Hoosville as the Minnesota Twins affiliate.

A limited number of seats are available for the five game series. The games on Thursday and Friday will be at 6:35 p.m.. Saturday's game is at 6:05 p.m., followed by the first Saturday spectacular fireworks display. The series will conclude with a 1:05 p.m. game on Sunday.

1464,Details remain sparse in Cove homicide,"PANAMA CITY — The scene of a quadruple shooting Thursday that left one person dead and three with life-threatening injuries was still blocked off with police tape Sunday morning, a lone silver unmarked police vehicle keeping watch as the neighborhood showed signs of returning to normal.

A couple out walking their dogs, who live close to the Allen Avenue address where the shooting took place, said things are beginning to settle back down, but neighbors are still shaken by the perceived lack of information and lack of apparent motive in the killing. The fact that the person of interest named in the case, 53-year-old Michael Harrison Hunt, an absconded sex offender, has been taken into custody on unrelated charges but not charged yet in connection with the homicide, has also left them feeling uneasy.

Severe storms raging through the area Thursday night leading up to the time of the shooting kept most people indoors. The couple, who declined to be named, said they took advantage of a break in the rain that night to walk their dogs but, instead of taking their usual route, which would bring them by the area of the shooting, they decided to stop at the corner and turn back. They got back to their residence and went inside, then noticed emergency vehicles descending on the area.

“We just missed it,” the woman said. “We didn’t hear anything. Everyone we talked to didn’t hear anything. And we hear everything where we live.”

As of Sunday, details on the homicide remain sparse. Panama City Police declined to identify the victims, stating that victims’ names are exempt from public record, citing Florida Statute 119.071.

What is known is that one victim was pronounced dead on scene, while three others were transported with life-threatening injuries. Police say the shooter and the victims were known to each other and it was not a random act, but have not charged Hunt as a suspect, only naming him as a person of interest.

Law enforcement had already been on Hunt’s tail after he failed to appear for a pretrial conference on April 1 relating to Sept. 2018 charges of unlawful sex acts with certain minors and aggravated assault with a firearm. On Friday, after police named him publicly as a person of interest in the shooting, Hunt proceeded to call a local news station, WMBB News 13, several times to proclaim his innocence and announce his intentions to turn himself in, first at the television station in Downtown Panama City, then at the Bay County Sheriff’s Office, according to WMBB’s report. Eventually, he was picked up by law enforcement on the corner of US 231 and Star Avenue, possibly on his way to the Bay County Jail.

He has since been charged with human trafficking and sexual battery on a person under 18.

Hunt has an extensive criminal history across the state of Florida and has been arrested numerous times on charges related to drawing income from prostitution and sexual battery on underage victims. He was found guilty in 1990 of rape while serving in the U.S. Army and served time in prison.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Hunt was also connected to a 2010 rape of a teenager in Hillsborough County. A rape kit was done at the time of the investigation, but according to the report, the kit was caught in a backlog of untested rape kits and went untested for five years, until 2015. Hunt’s DNA, on file from a 2002 assault case involving a 16-year-old where he was acquitted, matched the DNA from the long-stored kit, but by then the statute of limitations on sex with a minor had expired and the victim, who told a judge she’d just gotten over what had happened, wasn’t interested in pursuing a case.

According to the Florida Department of Corrections website, in 2013, Hunt was sentenced to three years in Hillsborough County on drug related charges. He was then sentenced in 2014 to two years for grand theft out of Polk County for an incident in 2011, and then was sentenced to 2 years and 10 months for living off the earnings of a prostitute out of Pinellas County. Records show him incarcerated from April 2013 to his release in June 2015.

On Sept. 12 2018, Hunt was arrested after he allegedly showed a gun when confronted by a man about having sex with a neighbor’s underage daughter. That investigation led to charges of unlawful sexual contact with certain minors. He was held on combined $65,000 bail, but posted two days later and was released.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190407/details-remain-sparse-in-cove-homicide?rssfeed=true,2019-04-07T13:54:26Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401

1467,North Carolina couple celebrate 82nd wedding anniversary,"CHARLOTTE, NC (WFLA/WCNC) – A North Carolina couple has been married longer than most of us have been alive.

Daniel Williams, 103, and Willie Williams, 100, recently celebrated their 82nd wedding anniversary.

Together, the Charlotte couple share one daughter and one granddaughter.

While they don’t get out much, they do make it to church every Sunday, sitting in the front pew.

The Williams say they don’t have any secrets to their longevity, all they have is love for each other and God, who they say is solely responsible for their 82 years together.

""People might not believe but we have never been the type that will fuse and fight. We just find funny things to talk about,” said Willie.

1470,Man's walk through depression takes him along Florida's coast,"DAYTONA BEACH — Donnie Alford walked along the Daytona Beach shoreline with a 40-pound backpack on his shoulders, a fading sunburn and a bright coral shirt with ""#MWTD My Walk Through Depression"" printed in bold white lettering.

A couple walked up to him and the woman, Sandy Matthew, engaged him in a conversation that lasted 30 minutes about her own struggles with depression, including how music, prayer and living life to the fullest has helped her achieve happiness.

""I beat depression 11 months ago and I've lost 135 pounds,"" she said. ""Can we get a picture of your shirt?""

Alford, 39, is walking the entire length of Florida's coast to raise awareness for depression and suicide prevention. He began March 15 in Fernandina Beach at the Georgia line and plans to walk all the way to Tampa. From there he will take a bus to the Alabama line and walk to Mexico Beach, which Hurricane Michael devastated last fall. Once there he plans to stay nearly a month to provide free construction help to families still struggling to rebuild.

On Monday, he made it to Daytona Beach, the first of his planned stops.

""I just want to reach out to people who are depressed and talk to them,"" Alford said. ""I have depression and I have secluded myself in the past. I really want to use this walk to reach out.""

Alford lost his father, Thomas Alford, to suicide on Feb. 26, 2014. His father had been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver three years prior, a late-stage of scarring on the liver which is caused by disease and other conditions.

""I found him,"" Alford said, his eyes brimming with tears. ""Out of the blue he'd asked me to come take care of him, and so I sold my business and moved to Spartanburg, South Carolina for him. I was up there three years and then he took his life.""

To make matters worse, the day of his father's funeral, the mother of Alford's son died of a brain aneurysm. Then, just a few weeks later, he watched his grandfather pass away from dementia.

""I was having to start my life over,"" Alford said. ""I was so screwed up from losing everybody, I got to the point where I did not want to live.""

Alford was diagnosed with severe depression, something he'd dealt with before all the loss in his life. His motivation to keep going was to not put his loved one's through the same pain he'd experienced losing his father.

""The thought of hurting the people who love me like I was hurt changed my whole thought process,"" Alford said.

His longtime friend, Christy Brock, said Alford changed when he decided to go on the walk around the edge of Florida.

""Before he was really down, he didn't do a lot, and he cried all the time,"" Brock said. ""When he decided he was going to go, I don't know what happened, but his whole demeanor changed. He became happy and he has a purpose.""

Growing up, Alford's father often took him to the beach to go boogie boarding and golfing.

""He loved the beach, that was his favorite place,"" Alford said. ""That was the best part of my life when we would boogie board, and the waves would crash over us.""

His father's love of the beach is what sparked the idea to walk nearly 700 miles around Florida's coast.

""I sold my personal vehicle and I'm using that money along with donations to my GoFundMe page from friends and family,"" Alford said. ""I'm on a budget so I'm only stopping for a room every few days.""

The straps on Alford's backpack broke on the first day of his journey, and are now tied together. The pack contains five t-shirts with his journey printed on the front, jogging pants, a pair of jeans, compression pants, a rain suit, an umbrella, rechargeable phone batteries, basic toiletries and a beach towel.

""I walk 10 miles at a time then I'll take a 25-minute break, get up and walk again,"" Alford said. ""I walked for 26 hours straight the first day.""

Alford's plan at the start of his journey was to walk through the night and take naps on the beach during the day. His plan has altered because he feels ""weird"" about sleeping on the beach in front of people's homes so he goes as long as he can before getting a room at a hotel along the way.

Brock said the extra hotel stops are draining his small budget, but Alford isn't the kind of guy to ask for help.

""He wants to help people along the way, but he could use the help himself sometimes,"" Brock said. ""He's also having trouble finding places to volunteer. No one is calling him back. So if someone needs a volunteer, reach out to him.""

Alford will occasionally approach people, but most of his discussions are initiated by beach-goers reading his shirt and asking him about his journey.

""This walk is helping me with my own depression,"" Alford said, explaining that when he's frustrated or sad he'll go on a walk to cool off and get perspective. ""I felt my depression really hard until now. I have been so happy this entire walk just talking and interacting with people.""

He is recording his journey through photos, videos and Facebook Live on his public Facebook blog, ""My Walk Through Depression."" His page has 1,003 followers and he uses it as a way to stay connected with the people he meets along his the way.

""If they don't want to open up in person but decide they want to talk later they can message me,"" he said. ""I talk to someone from England every night, so they aren't alone.""

Alford said making other people happy gives his life meaning.

1471,"Florida parents who didn't know girl was gone for 14 hours charged with neglect, authorities say","The girl, believed to be 2, was found wandering in a park near PBIA on Friday night.

WEST PALM BEACH — Parents of a toddler allegedly said it took 14 hours to realize they had left her at a park. Now the suburban West Palm Beach couple is charged with child neglect and another seven of their children have been pulled from their home, authorities said Sunday.

Makenson Alexandre, 34, was booked Saturday afternoon at the Palm Beach County Jail and left early Sunday morning. Jolanda Larose Alexandre, 27 — her first name also is spelled Yolanda — was booked Saturday afternoon and left a few hours later. Both posted $3,000 bail.

Makensen said at midday Monday that he could not comment now but might later. He declined to give either his daughter's name or age.

According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, the girl, believed to be 2, was found wandering alone just before 8 p.m. Friday at Haverhill Park, on Belvedere Road, west of Palm Beach International Airport. She wore a pink short-sleeve shirt with ""adorable"" on the front, along with a white and gold-colored tutu and clear plastic shoes.

Deputies canvassed the area and reverse 911 calls were made in an effort to find the girl’s parents. The agency sent out a note for media outlets headlined, ""Do you know who I am?""

Late Friday, authorities placed the child with the Florida Department of Children and Families.

At about 11:40 a.m. Saturday, the parents reported their daughter missing. Detectives went to their home in the Stacy Street apartments, near Belvedere and Haverhill, about a half mile north of the park. The parents said they had not realized until then that they didn't have the little girl.

DCF removed the other seven children from the home and the parents were arrested, PBSO said Sunday morning.

According to a sheriff's report, two women walking in the park had come across the child and called authorities. The wife told deputies she'd loaded the children in her SUV, picked up her husband at work and headed to the park, where he let the children play for about an hour. She said when she returned home, she thought she saw the 2-year-old playing outside before she went to sleep.

She said she awoke at about 8:30 a.m. Saturday and soon realized the toddler wasn't there. She said she asked the other children and they said the toddler hadn't slept with them.

She said she and the other children ""began looking frantically for"" the toddler, then called 911. The report said the mother ""was crying and shaking and said she cannot believe that she left (name withheld) in the park. She said this is the first time anything like this has happened and her children have never gone missing before.""

The mother said she usually checks on the children at bedtime but had not done so this time.

The father told investigators he also did not check on the children, either when leaving the park or when returning home about 7:15 p.m. He said he dressed and went to church, then came home around 11 p.m. and went to sleep. He also said he did not check on the children. He said he loaded the children in the SUV on Saturday morning to go back to the park and it wasn't until they nearly were there that he realized the toddler was missing.

1474,Fascination with radio jets draws many at Florida Jets 2019,"LAKELAND — ""There are no amateurs here at all — none,"" said Frank Tiano, developer and promoter of the Florida Jets annual ""Jet Together"" event held this week at Paradise RC Field at the Sun 'n Fun campus in Lakeland.

The radio-control jet show drew thousands of spectators and featured a couple hundred jet entries, pilots and non-pilots, who came from all across the world for the event.

Truly, these are not simply ""model airplanes.""

On Saturday, Tiano watched as another round of jets took off, flying a special pattern so as to avoid colliding with each other and respecting their neighbor's air space. Everything is just like it would be with a full size jet, he said. ""They are built exactly like jet airliners."" Twirling, diving, zooming in formation, some even hovering, a feat unusual to see.

""The questions most people ask are how high they go, how fast they go, and how expensive are they to fly,"" said Tiano.

As for ""how high,"" there are regulations, he said. Although the jets can go quite high, they are restricted to flying below 1,000 feet and to speeds of 200 miles per hour or less, even if they are capable of more. Just like full size jets, they roar as they warm up, and both take off and land into the wind. They weigh anywhere from 20 pounds upward to 70 pounds.

The average cost of these jets, he said, can run from $12,000 to $25,000, ""and up.""

Each jet requires four large electric batteries, which run about 120 cycles between recharges before they are tossed for new ones. Batteries run about $100 each.

And these jets also use jet fuel, kerosene, or diesel to run. Jet pilots have to be a member of the Academy of Model Aeronautics and learn how to fly the jets safely and be familiar with fuel systems.

""Model airplanes have been around since 1927 at events,"" Tiano said. One of the earlier such events in history was the Mirror Meeting, sponsored by The Daily Mirror, a newspaper in Long Island, New York.

""They did not have jets back then nor radio control planes,"" he said.

Radio control came into being during the 1960s.

Some participants in the Florida Jets show are professional pilots, for a living, Tiano said.

Some are surgeons, some are military pilots.

Many pilots enjoy building model airplanes of the full size aircraft they fly.

The event itself is a big draw for economic development in Lakeland, Tiano said.

""The biggest thing for the community is this event every year books over 1,200 room nights in local hotels,"" he said. That is not counting the gas they use for RVs and trailers to pull the planes to the show. Then they buy jet fuel at the field.

Why are the jets so popular?

Michael Abraira, team pilot at Horizon Hobby, an international hobby product distributor, said he has always had a fascination with flight.

He used to be into radio control cars, and then decided he wanted something different.

""Flight's more impressive than something that rolls on the ground.""

Although considered a hobby for the elite, jet technology is growing and making it more accessible. ""You can literally get into flying a small jet for about $150 to learn the principles of flying jets,"" Abraira said.

The ""hobby"" soon became a very large part of his life, he notes, as he eventually went on to buy his own hobby shop in July last year.

He said he has made a lot of friends and enjoys seeing them at all the shows they attend every year.

His friend Ali Machinchy, lives in Monticello, Illinois, but is originally from the United Kingdom.

He said many participants traveled two to three days to attend the event.

For those who are not pilots of full size planes, he said, it gives them a chance to experience aviation.

""We want to be pilots at the end of the day. We want to fly jet fighters,"" he said. Like Abraira, his ""hobby,"" has actually paid for his travel.

Lakeland is such a great venue, he said, ""Our first chance to get out after a long, cold winter. Some people bring their families and make it a holiday.""

One advantage is their show has enough room, he said, yet they are close enough to town to enjoy the amenities.

Many such shows are held in remote places, he said, ""where you are stuck out in the boonies.""

The radio-control jets have grown in popularity, said Tiano, since some 20 years ago, when they used to meet in Bunnell.

""We outgrew that site,"" he said. That is when Lakeland Linder Airport officials told him they thought they had plenty of room for Florida Jets to hold their shows.

Saturday was the final day of the three-day event.

1475,"Possible apartments stir hope, concern in Daytona's Midtown","A Massachusetts nonprofit agency is looking into constructing three apartment buildings on city land off of Orange Avenue just east of Nova Road.

DAYTONA BEACH — With a new 100-bed shelter for the homeless slated to open at the end of the year, local leaders are pondering where those struggling people will go once they're stable enough to live on their own.

More low-cost housing will be needed to keep people from drifting back to the streets, and city leaders hope they've found a project that will fill some of that demand.

A Massachusetts-based nonprofit agency called Solider On, which has been building affordable housing for the past decade, might construct three new apartment buildings on city-owned property just east of Nova Road near International Speedway Boulevard.

Nothing's been decided yet, but if plans come together as many as 100 new rental units off Orange Avenue could be up in a few years. The decision should be made in a couple of months.

It would be desperately needed affordable housing open to anyone who qualified financially, but first preference would be given to people transitioning from the First Step Shelter being built five miles west of Interstate 95 on U.S. 92.

While local leaders are excited about a chance to create new affordable housing, some people who live near the proposed apartment site don't want the project in their neighborhood.

""The building could be quality, but who are you going to put in there?"" asked John McMillon, whose home is across the street from the project site.

Bruce Buckley, Soldier On's president and CEO, said his organization has to choose sites with good access to businesses, services and transportation. But the nonprofit also tries ""not to go anywhere we're pushing our way into an area,"" he said.

Last year, Soldier On officials had their eye on a 17-acre property on George Engram Boulevard a short distance east of Nova Road. There were complications because the land is owned by the Daytona Beach Housing Authority and people in that neighborhood objected loudly, so the idea was dropped.

The FAITH group, which is made up of 30 local houses of worship, has spent years urging local leaders to get the homeless shelter built. Now the group is making affordable housing one of its top priorities for the upcoming year, a focus of FAITH's annual action assembly held Monday night at Peabody Auditorium.

""FAITH is excited about any affordable housing in this area because we know there's a need and there's an affordable housing crisis,"" said Jackie Mole, who co-chairs FAITH's affordable housing committee.

While wages have been stagnant for many Volusia County residents, rent has soared 20 percent in the past 10 years, according to figures tabulated by the Commission on Homelessness and Housing for Volusia and Flagler counties. In 2009, rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Volusia County averaged $896. Now that average has jumped to $1,083.

Local leaders are excited about working with Soldier On, which has a solid track record of building quality housing and retaining its residents longterm. Up to now the nonprofit has exclusively helped veterans, but has agreed to branch out in Daytona Beach to meet local housing needs.

[ALSO READ: Daytona Beach Homeless Shelter Board Looking at Permanent Housing]

For its first 16 years, Soldier On only offered veteran services. Then in 2010 the agency based in Pittsfield, Mass., started providing permanent housing, some newly built and some in rehabbed schools.

The nonprofit owns and operates 177 affordable housing units in four Massachusetts cities. The organization says it's expanding its housing now into New York, New Jersey, Mississippi and Florida.

Soldier On provides its residents ongoing case management, job assistance, legal help, financial assistance, transportation, basic medical and dental care, food, mental health counseling, treatment for addictions and life skills training. All residents in Soldier On permanent housing are required to complete a life skills program that takes 15 hours and covers financial literacy, legal issues, rules and regulations, wellness and basic life skills.

Soldier On does not ban alcoholics and drug addicts from its properties, but it doesn't allow illegal drug use in its homes and relapses are met with intervention efforts.

Preliminary plans for the proposed site in central Daytona Beach call for one-bedroom apartments that would be available to single adults struggling financially.

But the new housing, if built, would not be designed to fulfill the affordable housing needs of the greater community. For example, couples or people with children would not be accepted, Buckley said.

Available units would be offered first to people coming out of First Step Shelter and those living in a city-supported group home on Kingston Avenue called Restoration House.

Buckley said there's no detailed plan yet for the Midtown neighborhood site, which he checked out during a visit to Daytona Beach in late February. He said the property could work, but he' still checking into financing for construction, which he's guessing could cost anywhere from $12 million to $25 million.

""It's not like we've got a big pot of money to start building,"" Buckley said.

He said if he pursues the project he'll probably apply for a federal tax credit program to help with construction costs. Since the site is in the Midtown Redevelopment Area, Buckley said city officials told him they might be able to waive some fees and costs, or offer some other sort of financial assistance.

Buckley said he's also exploring subsidies from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as a cooperative arrangement where rent could go toward ownership of units.

Ronald Durham, the city's community relations manager, said his recommendation would be to lease the city property for 75 years and only charge $1 since Solider On is a nonprofit.

""We should know in a few months if we'll do it,"" Buckley said.

If the project moves forward, construction could start in 2020 or 2021, he said.

Mayor Derrick Henry, who has made affordable housing a top priority, said if plans come together there will be public meetings before anything is decided.

""We're waiting on them to offer a proposal,"" said Henry, who likes what he's heard so far. ""If it's agreeable to residents, I don't see any reason to be opposed.""

City Commissioner Paula Reed, whose zone includes the site, agreed public meetings need to be held if the idea moves forward.

""I'd like there to be a community forum for the citizens of Zone 6 to have input,"" said Reed, who lives near the site. ""I definitely want them to be aware.""

For decades, the city's police department had been located on the corner of Nova Road and Orange Avenue — just northwest of the proposed apartment site. Back then officers used part of the block being considered for the housing project for parking.

Once filled with police cruisers, the large parking lot is barren now, the asphalt is cracking and the chain link fencing topped with razor wire is caked in rust. On the east side of the block, there is a driveway leading to nothing in a spot where a church once stood. A few stretches of the block were once occupied by homes, but now sit vacant.

The only structure left on the block is Sharon Williams' home. There's nothing fancy about Williams' aging one-story home on the northwest corner of Maley and Caroline streets with its bare wood fence and collapsing shed out back. But she enjoys being the only inhabitant of the entire block and the large thicket of tall trees around her aqua-colored home.

Williams' lot runs deep into the block, but the city owns about 3.5 acres there and could build the apartments without her land, Durham said.

Williams and McMillon are already questioning if their neighborhood just east of Nova Road is the right spot for the project. They equate low-income housing with trouble, even if it's attractive well-built housing.

As she looked at the crime-ridden Gardens of Daytona apartments just south of Maley Street, a place neighborhood residents call Soul City, Williams said, ""There's enough going on here.""

""When they run from the police they zoom through here,"" said Williams, who's been in her home for more than 30 years. ""I'm not against people finding a place to stay, but that would be the wrong place to put them.""

The 83-year-old McMillon has lived on Caroline Street across from Williams' house since 1968. He watched as the Gardens of Daytona apartments just down the street from his modest home were constructed, and he watched the 230-unit low-income housing complex devolve into a place that's spurred tens of thousands of calls to police.

""Daytona Gardens has become a crime haven,"" said the retired pastor, who was a volunteer chaplain for the Sheriff's Office for 17 years. ""If you put low-income housing here, it will be the same problem. We don't need that in this neighborhood. Why don't they build upscale apartments or condos?""

Others who also care about the neighborhood want to give the Soldier On idea a chance.

Danny Fuqua, a member of the Midtown Redevelopment Board, was against Soldier On locating on George Engram Boulevard because it was too deep into a residential area, but he's open to the new location and proposal.

""I think it's a great idea,"" Fuqua said.

Derrick Harris, who owns and runs Cut Masters barbershop on Orange Avenue, said the Midtown neighborhood has been ""decimated"" and the apartments could spark new development. But mostly he likes the idea of helping people trying to get back on their feet.

""I applaud the effort,"" said Harris, whose small shop is one block east of the apartment site. ""I think any step the city takes to help those who have gone through a hard way of life is a step in the right direction.""

He said the community needs to do everything it can to help.

""We've put such a blockade up for those who are homeless,"" Harris said. ""Many of us are one paycheck away from being homeless ourselves. Everyone deserves a second chance.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190412/possible-apartments-stir-hope-concern-in-daytonas-midtown?rssfeed=true,2019-04-12T17:37:26Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
1480,P & Z punts on Serenity PUD,"After listening for over two hours to public comments, mainly from South Bayshore Drive neighbors who live nearby, the county planning and zoning board Tuesday night split down the middle and therefore took no action on a mixed use resort development proposed for Eastpoint.

With board members Paul Riegelmayer, Jerry Jackson and chairman John Murphy against it, and Skip Frink, Nancy Deal and Lon Wilkens in favor, the proposal for a planned unit development (PUD) on a 57-acre parcel of land now heads to the county commission without the blessing of P & Z, for them to decide whether or not to go forward and schedule a public hearing.

The acreage is bordered by Island Drive on the east, South Bayshore Drive and Las Brisas subdivision on the south and west, and commercial properties facing US 98 on the north.

The Serenity Seaside Resort, a limited liability company in the hands of investors Craig and Lindlee Dermody, from Walton County, is seeking approval for a PUD that would allow for 56 single family residential homes, each about 1,200 square feet, expected to sell in the $200,000 to $250,000 range.

The resort also would feature a 25-room inn, as well as an additional 50 bungalows surrounding a man-made lake, most of them 425 square feet, 10 of them 600 square feet, that would also be transient rentals.

“We did it that way to utilize the beauty of the land,” said Craig Dermody. “The lake is stunning.”

Scratched from the plans were 150 RV slips that he and his then partner, Max Cross, proposed over a year ago as an essential component of the “Serenity By the Sea Motor Coach Resort and Coastal Cottages.” In Jan. 2018, P and Z voted unanimously not to recommend that this earlier plan move forward.

In their opening remarks, the Dermodys stressed that, over the course of the year they were required to wait before reintroducing plans to the county, they listened carefully to suggestions from local residents before revising the proposal.

Lindlee Dermody said the couple joined the chambers of commerce and the St. George Island Civic Club, and worked with local realtors to acquaint themselves with the community.

“We’re not just going in and giving you our plan and not taking into consideration (your thoughts),” she said. “It’s going to be great. It may not satisfy everyone’s concerns. It’s a worthy approach, a responsible approach, for a safe and sustainable community in Eastpoint.”

She said she and her husband’s investment firm, LCD Investments, has experience developing residential home projects, and that they hope to eventually become Franklin County residents.

She said inclusion of Eastpoint two years ago within Gov. Scott’s Opportunity Zones enables Serenity to spur long-term economic development and investment in this unincorporated portion of the county, which she noted is in the bottom fourth of the poorest communities in the state and nation. As an Opportunity Zone, capital investment in the project would bring with it lucrative savings, which increase over time, on capital gains taxes.

Lidless Dermody said units would be built by First Choice Builders, owned by Bryce Ward, as well as Peeler Construction out of Lake City, and local sub-contractors.

She said Serenity would provide affordable hotel accommodations, as well as government revenues from bed taxes and ad valorem property taxes. Short-term jobs would be created by construction, and long-term jobs would be sustained in maintenance, housekeeping and property management, she said.

A 10-000 square-foot center with catering kitchen, for both community gatherings as well as small corporate meetings and retreats, would be built as well, Lindlee Dermody said.

In his introduction, County Planner Mark Curenton told P & Z that as a “site specific zoning category, (a PUD) allows for people to do innovative techniques that are not necessarily covered in existing zoning categories.

“It allows the county and the developer to work together,” he said. “The county would give them more density and they would give the county something else, such as greater environmental protection, greater setbacks, whatever the county decides is appropriate.”

He said the hotel would include a coffee shop, and other amenities such as a laundry to service the accommodations, but there would be no retail sales outlets or professional offices allowed under terms of the proposed PUD.

“It’s up to y’all to make a recommendation whether you all think the tradeoffs proposed are good tradeoffs and would be a benefit to the county or not,” Curenton said. “You sort of negotiate what’s in it.”

Tradeoffs the developers stressed would benefit the county would be that 40 of the 57 acres would be dedicated as green space and recreational space, all roads and patios would be permeable, all units would be on Eastpoint water and sewer, and stormwater management practices, mandated by the Northwest Florida Water Management District, would decrease groundwater runoff into the bay.

“No developer wants to go into a project without knowing the environmental issues. That’s the first thing you take into consideration,” said Lindlee Dermody.

Environmental engineer Dan Garlick said terms of the PUD stand in contrast to the “uncontrolled development” found on St. George Island and other areas, where he said wetlands can be incorporated into a site plan, and eventually lost.

“You don’t have to protect wetlands, you can make wetlands part of the lots,” he said.

Garlick said Serenity has a stormwater plan that uses undeveloped space to hold runoff and trap unwanted material. “You end up using more area that could remain vegetated, and these are really good soils for stormwater treatment,” he said. “This site is going to take care of itself, that’s what you get in a PUD. You don’t get it on St. George Island.”

Noise, traffic and density all concerns

While most of the immediate neighbors were opposed to the current plans, the audience appeared mixed in their views, many arguing Serenity would bring much-needed economic growth to the area.

First to speak was Eastpoint Fire Chief George Pruett, also an Eastpoint businessman, who asked whether each of the single-family homes would pay the annual MSBU fees of $52 per unit, and if so, the cost to the department for adding additional firefighting responsibilities would be on the plus side.

“It would actually generate quite a bit of revenue,” he said, adding the department currently handles about 300 medical-related calls a year.

“It would not be an undue burden for us,” he said. “I for one believe Eastpoint is due some development, something worthy of being shown. I think these people have spent a lot of money to come down here, they have a constitutional right to reap some benefits from their effort.

“It (development) is going to happen anyway, you might as well get used to it,” Pruett said. “It will be a benefit for all of us.”

Eastpoint resident Tom Loughridge stressed that more than two-thirds of the county continue to make their livings directly from the fishing industry, and cited data for seafood landings that indicated millions of dollars in income continues to be reaped.

He said he liked that Serenity would offer permeable surfaces, but “roofs are not permeable, at least I hope not. We’re looking at 106 different roofs.”

Loughridge said development along the coast continues to pour harmful runoff into the river and bay, which impacts this nursery for marine life, leading to loss of habitat and species.

Jeanne Dail, who lives nearby to proposed project, said she not opposed to “nice development,” but to its density.

“They could do up to a 50-room motel, it would be beautiful. We need something like that,” she said, noting that conservation lands surround the development. “If they would abide by the comp plan, we wouldn’t be here tight.”

The Dermodys argued the project was firmly in keeping with the comp plan’s goals for open space, and getting rid of septic systems in favor of sewer. Garlick said the developers could pursue a zoning change allowed for such sewage conversions, that if approved, would allow them to nearly triple the number of residential units, to 141.

“The cost to put in sewer and water is a half-million dollars,” said Craig Dermody. “We want to do it because it’s the right thing to do for the estuary and the environment.”

Dail and others, including Elaine Kozlowsky, who lives across the street from Serenity, said the fact that South Bayshore is a scenic route, where thru trucks are forbidden, must be taken into account.

“Even though they’re having a 50 foot buffer, you can’t tell me runoff is not going to go into the estuary itself,” said Dail.

She said Jennifer Harper, director of the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve, which borders Serenity, has told her she is inquiring whether the land could be bought by state monies to be preserved.

Kozlowsky read a letter from longtime P & Z member Larry Perryman opposed to the project, citing long-standing concerns about drainage, as well as the fact that the county lacks a code enforcement officer who would hold the developer’s feet to the fire in the event they do not comply.

Another neighbor, Tony Partington, echoed concerns about traffic on South Bayshore, and that the development would add to the existing burden on law enforcement and emergency response. He said he has called state officials to see whether the land has significant historical, cultural or archeological significance.

He said the housing stock created would not be affordable by most local working people. “How are you going to feed your family on if you’re paying 40 percent of your income to a mortgage?” he said. “There’s no question Eastpoint has a rough go of things. It’s been very difficult for us as an entity to help these people who need housing here.

“We’re trying to find creative and new ways to help these people,” said Partington, chairman of the Habitat for Humanity board. “I question whether or not these houses, as nice as they may be, are an answer for those people in FEMA trailers and tents.”

Lavern Holman, who also lives on South Bayshore, said “nothing has changed in a year on Bayshore. We still live on a Florida scenic highway. We still live on a county road that can’t handle any more traffic. It has become a race track.”

“I’m strongly opposed to any connection of this to South Bayshore,” she said, noting that she was “100 percent for the hotel. After all we are in the tourist business.”

Lauren Luberto, a homeowner in Los Brisas, said she believes the single-family homes will be bought by investors and used as rental property, further worsening congestion.

“I bought my house in a quiet peaceful neighborhood. I feel this is too much,” she said. “Fifty-six homes located 600 feet from my home, there’s going to be noise.

Eastpoint resident Tammy Flagg noted that there have been several failed subdivisions on this land. “I think it’s important to say no to this. I’m vehemently against this,” she said. It is moderately priced for people in my income level but for people in Eastpoint, it doesn’t come close.

“We don’t need a developer to come in and builds houses that are that close together,” she said.

Hank Kozlowsky said making an exception to allow this level of density will set a precedent that will be difficult to undo.

“Every exception you make sets a precedent for the next person in line,” he said. “They are asking you to step into a quagmire that I can assure you, you will never come out of unscathed.”

He said much more study is needed before a determination can be made that the existing infrastructure can handle it.

“Who is going to determine the growth and development of Franklin County?” he asked. “Will be elected representatives and citizens or be dictated by the whims of out of town developers? That’s the choice they are asking you to make and I ask that you choose wisely.”

Eastpoint resident Denise Butler spoke in favor of the project, noting that “this was never proposed as affordable housing. It’s proposed to give an option for very expensive and getting more expensive homes, for people who still want to come here and enjoy our bay and enjoy way of life.

“It’s time for us to have some real frank discussions what we want our community to look like,” she said. “We all really love this place and want to see it done right.”",https://www.apalachtimes.com/news/20190410/p-amp-z-punts-on-serenity-pud?rssfeed=true,2019-04-10T14:51:22Z,The Times,Couple,"129 Commerce St, Apalachicola, FL 32320, USA",FL,32320
1482,Report details ESE program needs,"NICEVILLE — The Florida Department of Education has released its findings on the Okaloosa County School District’s Exceptional Student Education programs.

The FDOE visited Kenwood Elementary School and Silver Sands School on Feb. 5-6 and returned its full report April 4.

The School District said Kenwood and Silver Sands were the two schools chosen for visits because of issues that needed attention.

""The Department of Education asked for two schools to visit, and the district recommended these two specifically due to the incidents that were reported at each school,"" Assistant Superintendent Steve Horton said. ""Both schools have terrific teachers and staffs, but the fact of the matter is there have been issues that we have to address.""

Kenwood and Silver Sands schools have been tarnished in recent years by the arrests of teachers accused of abusing special needs children in their care. Silver Sands also had a retired educator stripped of his teaching certification when the state investigated reports of past abuse.

In compiling their report, state officials interviewed five focus groups, including administrators, teachers, behavioral teams, paraprofessionals and parent groups to determine what areas needed improvement within the district's ESE programs. Common themes in all five groups included a need for more professional specialists, further training for teachers and a timely process to make improvements.

The report noted that some positions needed include behavioral specialists, speech and language pathologists, a school counselor, a social worker and a mental health specialist.

Superintendent of Schools Marcus Chambers said he plans to restructure and realign the district's staff and finances to find money to hire the needed personnel.

“In order to do that it’s going to take a strong financial commitment from me, a strong financial commitment from the School District and from the board,” he said. “I’m very much committed to making these changes. I think first and foremost our ESE students deserve it. I think our teachers deserve it and obviously our parents deserve it.”

The district’s ESE programs have been under scrutiny since August 2017 when Eddie Perillo came forward with information that his autistic son had been abused while enrolled at Kenwood Elementary. The information led to a series of investigations and the arrest of four district officials for child abuse or failing to report child abuse. Pre-K disabled teacher Marlynn Stillions was convicted in 2018 of child abuse and sentenced to seven years in prison.

The scandal also has resulted in a handful of still unresolved lawsuits and ultimately this year's suspension of Superintendent Mary Beth Jackson.

Following Jackson's suspension, the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office announced the arrests of three Silver Sands ESE teachers on charges of aggravated battery. A Shalimar Elementary guidance counselor has also been arrested this year for failing to report child abuse.

During Jackson's tenure, Chambers served as assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction, and took over as assistant superintendent of human resources after the former HR director, Stacie Smith, was arrested and charged with failing to report a child's abuse case.

Chambers said he was aware of problems in the ESE programs during his time under Jackson, specifically the need for more staffing.

""Staffing, over the course of the last couple of years, is something that we’ve discussed in senior staff; it’s one of the things that we’ve looked at,"" Chambers said. ""We’ve made some changes over the course of the last two years as well.""

Chambers detailed that over the past two years the School District and School Board members have added several positions to the ESE staff, including an additional ESE specialist, two new staffing specialists, two behavioral analysts and a district staffing specialist.

As for the need for additional ESE training in several areas — from bus drivers to substitute teachers and general education teachers — Chambers said the district plans to implement programs as early as this summer. Parents have also requested information about what resources are available for their children.

“We will be working with organizations to deliver training for our teachers, classroom assistants and our general education teachers on topics such as accommodations and other areas detailed by the report,"" he said. ""We will even take it to the higher levels and the training will be mandatory for our ESE teachers.”

Chambers said he was not surprised by anything in the report because he personally requested the FDOE to assess the ESE program just one week after he took office in mid-January.

“This is a springboard that’s going to help us to do some necessary things for our students,” he said of the report's findings. “Now in my role as superintendent I have even more of an opportunity to make decisions that are going to strengthen our ESE program, and that’s exactly what I’m committed to doing.”

The FDOE will make another visit in the fall. Chambers said he is confidant that state officials will see great improvements in the ESE programs.

""I know that we will have a detailed training program in place for our teachers, classroom assistants and substitutes, and I believe that they will see the efforts we’ve made in communicating with parents and teachers,"" Chambers said.",https://www.thedestinlog.com/news/20190409/report-details-ese-program-needs?rssfeed=true,2019-04-09T18:20:21Z,The Destin Log,Couple,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
1483,"College baseball: Two years after quitting, FGCU's Jay Hayes leading Eagles against Miami","FGCU senior Jay Hayes is tied for the team lead in batting .375 and leads the Eagles in homers (7) and RBIs (36) heading into their game against the University of Miami on Wednesday at Swanson Stadium. (Photo: Brad Young/FGCU Athletics)

Jay Hayes didn't think he could stay on the FGCU baseball team any longer.

He was a third-year sophomore, and wasn't playing, so he decided he was going to transfer. After the first series of the 2017 season, Hayes let head coach Dave Tollett know, but Tollett had other ideas. He told Hayes to take some time, talk to his family, think about it, and then talk to Tollett again.

Ultimately, Hayes decided to stay, but sat out the rest of that season.

""I thought it would be better for me to go to a different school,"" he said. """"To' was gracious enough to give me a second chance. I think he understood I wasn't in the best place mentally, being a young guy.""

Last year, Hayes returned to the Eagles and was solid, but this year he's done much more than that.

Going into Tuesday night's road game at the University of Miami — the two teams will play Wednesday at FGCU's Swanson Stadium at 6:30 p.m. — Hayes was tied for the team lead in batting average at .375 and led the Eagles in homers (7) and RBIs (36). He also has a .688 slugging percentage.

This from a player who hit .279 with four homers and 32 RBIs last year.

Anytime the Eagles play the Hurricanes, it's a different level, although Tollett has to weigh the importance of doing well in the ASUN, especially when it comes to deciding his pitching rotation for a midweek nonconference game that is in many ways meaningless

But this is Miami, and likely will draw the best crowd, or one of the best, of the season.

""It's really exciting more than anything,"" Hayes said. ""We're not really nervous (about playing them), we're just excited. It's always fun to go against a quality team that's very competitive.""

Hayes had to leave to come back a different player, in more ways than one. The Altamonte Springs native played this summer for the Fayetteville SwampDogs in the Coastal Plain League in North Carolina.

There, he abandoned a leg kick in his swing.

""I made some adjustments at the plate,"" Hayes said. ""I took (the leg kick) away. I barely stride anymore. That really helped with my timing.""

Hayes also happened to be teammates with FGCU pitcher and Canterbury grad Tyler Shuck, who's had his own reckoning this year so far, going 6-0 with a 2.21 ERA for the Eagles, who were 22-9 going into Tuesday night's game.

""He was originally a two-way (player),"" Hayes said. ""He had a couple of outings, and he was throwing pretty good. Eventually they left him pitching. He figured some things out there, too. When he came back, he was lights out. I'm proud of him.""

FGCU was anything but lights-out last year, especially compared to its history. After getting off to a 25-7 start, the Eagles won just seven of their last 21 games, were 8-13 in the ASUN and didn't qualify for the conference postseason tournament.

""We had high expectations for ourselves coming into this year,"" Hayes said. ""We set high standards. We had some good freshmen coming in. I think we've had guys who've stepped up.""

And he's among them. Now Hayes wants to see that that happens for the rest of the season.

""I feel like I've put more work than I've ever had,"" he said. ""Considering this is my last year, it's something special. I put in a lot of time in the fall and the winter. I think I'm starting to see the benefits. You get out what you put in.

""I'll just keep the riding the train that got me here.""

The one that also kept him here.

FGCU, Miami tangle at Swanson

The 6:30 p.m. Wednesday game will be streamed on YouTube Live and will have live commentary. The game will serve as Military Appreciation Day and will be sponsored by Bank of America. Miami was 19-5 against FGCU heading into Tuesday night's game. Last season, FGCU won 1-0 at Swanson Stadium against the Hurricanes.

1486,"Frazier's Country Wines to launch winery, tasting bar in Pensacola on Barrancas","A new Pensacola winery on Barrancas plans to ""bring a taste of the mountains to paradise"" when it opens this summer.

That's the tagline that Pensacola couple Derek Frazier and Melanie Collins are attaching to Frazier's Country Wines, their winery and tasting bar that should launch in June on 3130 Barrancas Ave.

""Nothing in this area — and I may be shooting myself in the foot — but everything in this area is beach-oriented, I want something that's not beach-oriented,"" said Frazier, a native of Anniston, Alabama. ""My thought process is, if I'm going to do country wines, then I want a country feel. I want people to feel like they're in the mountains while still being at the beach.""

Buy Photo Renovations to this building on Barrancas Avenue are underway Wednesday. Once the remodel is complete, it will be the home of the new Frazier’s Country Wines. (Photo: Tony Giberson/tgiberson@pnj.com)

Frazier, the head vintner of his new venture, specializes in country, fruit-based wines. If it's a shiraz or pinot grigio you're after, Frazier's probably isn't the winery for you.

""We do very unique country wine, a lot of them are on the sweeter side,"" Frazier said. ""There will be a few dryer ones.""

Pomegranate, pear, honey pear, blackberry, blueberry and cranberry will headline the approximately 14 wines sold at the store, likely for $14 apiece, and packaged in vacuum-sealed mason jars to ensure longevity.

Whether they intended it to be or not, 14 seems to be Frazier and Collins' magic number, as most of their country wines carry a 14 percent alcohol level.

Their chocolate-strawberry wine flavor won't hit you quite as hard, Frazier said, at 8 percent. The newly professional wine maker said that among friends, family and co-workers, the chocolate-strawberry has garnered the most acclaim.

""We call it Old No. 1, chocolate-strawberry, we use all natural product, all natural strawberries and come back and flavor it with all natural chocolate,"" Frazier said. ""It's pretty freaking awesome.""

Frazier's wines will be light on acidity and low on tannins — one of the ingredients in wine most responsible for that nasty morning hangover you'll feel if you overindulge the night before.

Frazier has some, but not all of the fermenting tanks and equipment needed to pump out his homemade product. He has partnered with Florida Orange Groves Winery, based out of South Pasadena, to carry their 10 bestsellers in his winery while the new owners work to get their equipment installed and their paperwork hammered out with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

""We're partnering with them for the sake of getting open,"" Frazier said. ""Hopefully six to nine months down the road, we'll have our TTB paperwork in so we can start our own fermentation here.""

A huge garage-style door looks out onto Barrancas at the entrance of the property, which exhibits a bit of a rustic, country feel that Frazier feels reflects his new business.

The inside of the building will feature a spacious main floor that will seat close to 30, including bar seating. A bartender or attendant will man the tasting bar and pour glasses and samples during hours of operation.

""Basically if you wanted to walk in and said, 'Hey I want to try these four flavors,' you can do four for $10, and then if there's a flavor you'd like to buy, you can buy the jar of that wine,"" Collins said.

""You'll be able to buy a bottle, take it out with you, or you'll actually be able to come in and a enjoy a glass here and just chill out,"" Frazier added.

Frazier's is targeting a soft launch on April 13 and a grand opening in June. When it opens, it will likely be open for three days a week at first — on Fridays and Saturdays from noon to 8 p.m., and Sundays from 1-5 p.m.

The owners plan on hosting a gallery night inside of a side room of their property two or three times per quarter to showcase a rotating selection of local artists while serving hors d'oeuvres and wine.

That same room, and the entire public portion of the venue, will be available to rent for parties.

""We can hold about 75 people total, between this (art gallery room) and the main floor,"" Collins said. ""It's perfect for smaller weddings, baby showers, bridal showers, bachelor or bachelorette parties.""

It's not finalized yet, but Frazier said he's kicking around the idea of charging $400 for two-hour private tastings, which would give the buyer full private access to the venue. The owners said they'd likely provide meat, cheese and vegetable trays and have an attendant on hand to serve wine and, eventually, select local beers.

""We want it to be a comfortable place,"" Collins said. ""We want you to come in and for it to be homey.""

(Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat)

The week prior to Friday and Saturday’s Capital City Classic flag football tournament had been uneventful for Rickards.

Having not played since suffering their season’s only loss, 18-6 at unbeaten Class 1A No. 6 Florida High (8-0) on March 26, the Raiders were also down several players to Grad Bash activities for the weekend’s tournament at the FSU Rec SportsPlex.

But Rickards still had senior quarterback Iyanla “Scrap” Wooodfaulk, who chose to be with and lead her team.

“It’s something that I have, it’s just something that’s in me,” said Woodfaulk, who recently was named to the girls basketball All-Big Bend first team. “I refuse to be last. I refuse to not stand out. I will make a name for myself whether it’s win, lose, or draw.”

By Saturday afternoon at the FSU Rec SportsPlex, Woodfaulk filled up the win category and the Raiders had some well-earned hardware.

Class 1A No. 25 Rickards (6-1) went 3-0 in the Classic’s Silver bracket, capturing the championship against Class 2A No. 18 Martin County with a resounding 29-6 victory. The Raiders won 40-6 on Friday night against Belleview then opened Saturday with a 12-8 win over Class 2A No. 14 Mandarin.

“I saw a lot of second effort and a lot of girls who really wanted to win this championship,” Woodfaulk said. “They wanted to make a name for themselves.

“At times, we dropped our heads, but we’ve got some leaders out here who were willing to pick everyone up. Our energy was great. We were missing some key players, but everybody stepped up, got with the adjustments, and played their role. I’m very proud of these girls.”

Woodfaulk threw a short touchdown pass to senior Denia Love on Rickards’ opening drive, securing a 7-0 lead on her own conversion run. Then with under a minute to play before halftime, Woodfaulk hit Elysia Butler on a deep pass, setting up a short touchdown pass to Butler to provide a 13-0 lead at the break.

When Martin County scored late in the third quarter to cut the lead to 13-6, Woodfaulk came right back with a long touchdown pass to freshman Jakiyah Robinson, who recovered from a couple drops on long passes in the first half.

Then Alyssa Gilliam’s 40-yard pick-six in the fourth quarter cemented the victory, and the Raiders tacked on a safety for their final points.

In every facet, Rickards responded.

“We always teach our players to do their job because the players next to them are counting on them to do it,” first-year Rickards coach Tyrell Conyers said. “We had some players out with Grad Bash and track, but the underclassmen stepped up. Big performance by Jakiyah Robinson. It’s next man up. You have to do your job.”

From the Classic through its remaining three regular-season games, Rickards will try to build.

The Raiders hosts Lincoln on Tuesday followed by FAMU DRS on Thursday. They close at Godby on April 17 and hope they’ll have secured a spot in the four-team district tournament by then.

Last year, Rickards was in a three-team tiebreaker against Madison County and Florida High for one district tournament spot and came up short.

Despite a coaching change, Woodfaulk and Conyers believe they have a team that can contend for a district championship. The Raiders’ Classic performance proved as much.

“We can be in a place that no one expects us to be,” Woodfaulk said. “We’re trying to make a statement and make ourselves known. We’re trying to climb that ladder in the rankings.”

Gold, Bronze Championships

In a battle between the two defending state champions – Class 1A Tampa Robinson and 2A Tampa Alonso – it was Robinson which came away with a Gold bracket championship. The Knights rolled to a 26-6 win after previously beating 1A No. 20 Tarpon Springs (34-14) and 1A No. 18 Niceville (27-18).

No. 6 Alonso, which beat 1A No. 14 Lincoln 20-6 on Friday night, advanced to the championship with a 20-15 win over 2A No. 3 Wekiva.

Tampa Wharton beat Pace 14-7 in the Bronze bracket championship. The Wildcats shut out their first two opponents – winning 6-0 against Navarre on Friday night, followed by a 20-0 win over Atlantic on Saturday morning.

OTHER LOCALS:

No. 2 Godby Cougars (8-1)

Snapshot: The Cougars went 2-1 in the Gold bracket, dropping a Friday night game 10-6 to No. 18 Niceville, their first loss of the season. Quarterback Kaylene Colburn didn’t play that game or Saturday morning for team reasons. The Cougars needed five overtimes to beat No. 20 Tarpon Springs 26-20, then they edged 2A No. 17 Newsome 19-14 in the fifth-place game.

Quotable: “We faced a lot of adversity this weekend for numerous reasons,” Godby head coach Chelsea Parmer said. “To overcome that first night and come out Saturday against that same adversity and win in five overtimes it shows a lot about our fight. That last game, we were tired, but it’s not an excuse. If you want to make the big show, you’re going to play two games in one day. We’ve got to maintain our energy. We’re a little beat up, but that’s where we expect to be nine games in. We have a big game Thursday against Madison. Hopefully we can overcome our issues and get back on track.”

“I’ve been around flag football since 2005 and I’ve never experienced a five-overtime game until this year,” Parmer added. “It was very exciting. You want to be on defense, and your choice switches after each overtime period. Then you only get one time out, and we burned that in the second overtime. We didn’t have time to talk to our kids, but they fought extremely hard. It was fun to be a part of. Hopefully we won’t be in that position again, but if we are, we know how overtime works and what we need to do to win.”

No. 14 Lincoln Trojans (4-7)

Snapshot: Despite some stellar offensive and defensive play from sophomore Erin Turral – who busted long touchdown runs and grabbed interceptions – the Trojans’ slide continued, dropping all three games in the Gold bracket. After losing to Alonso 20-6 on Friday, the Trojans were undone 13-12 by Newsome in Game 2, and Tarpon Springs won 34-27 Saturday afternoon. In the two weeks prior to the tournament, Lincoln beat No. 18 Niceville and then lost to No. 13 Choctaw preceding Monday’s surprise loss to Chiles. Having lost five in a row, the Trojans may drop out of the top 25 and enter must-win territory with games Tuesday at No. 25 Rickards (6-1) and Thursday at No. 6 Florida High (8-0).

Quotable: “We definitely improved and did some good things, but we dropped all three games, so we’ve got to learn and coach to finish,” Lincoln head coach Brandon Youmans said. “We had a lead in all three games, but defensively we have to shore some things up. We had some people missing, but that’s no excuse. We have people that have been out here a while and know what to do. We’ve got to clean it up and get ready for district play. We’ve got a great Rickards team and a great Florida High team this week. We’re looking forward to that challenge and hopefully we make some plays.”

No. 15 Madison County Cowgirls (3-3)

Snapshot: Missing four starters against Martin County in Silver bracket play, the Cowgirls dropped their Friday opener 6-0. Madison County had ball inside the 10-yard line three times and didn’t score. Responding with a 32-0 win over Pines Charter on Saturday morning in a game where junior Lasage Ferguson was too much to handle, Madison’s third game ended with a 38-26 loss to Belleview. The Cowgirls held a 26-13 lead before giving up 25 straight points.

Quotable: “I think we got a little tired,” Madison County head coach Jim Ertzberger said. “We’ll fix that in practice, we’ll condition a little bit more. We got tired and gave out. That’s my job as a coach to go back and get them in better shape. We’ve got three games this week. We have to win against Leon because it’s sub-district. If we win that, we have a chance to force a tiebreaker playoff like last year. We’ve got to work hard, do the little things right. When we do that, we look really good, and when we don’t, it looks really bad.”

FAMU DRS Rattlers (2-7)

Snapshot: Dropping all three games in Silver bracket play, the Rattlers were without several of their top players due to an AAU basketball tournament. Opening with a 24-0 loss to Mandarin on Friday night, FAMU DRS lost 31-19 to Belleview and 40-0 to Pines Charter on Saturday.

Quotable: “I can improve on getting outside the pocket, setting my feet, using all my players, and then not getting beat on defense,” Rattlers quarterback Suraya Wash said. “When I’m getting ready to run, I need to use my fakes to create separation. We’re young and we have a lot of new players, middle-schoolers. We just need to work hard. We’ll be good if we stick with it.”

Leon Lions (4-5)

Snapshot: The Lions, who brought back just one varsity player and two JV players from last year, went a surprising 2-1 in Bronze bracket play. Starting play Saturday, Leon won a 6-0 game against Wakulla in overtime, then dropped a 25-6 game against Pace. In their last game, the Lions pulled out a 13-6 win over Atlantic.

Quotable: “We were missing some girls and really only had nine girls the whole day, playing both ways all day,” second-year Leon head coach James Green said. “They were extremely tired, so I give them credit for fighting adversity. I didn’t think we’d pull out the games today, but they did really well. As a coach, I can be proud of that. We play in the toughest district in the state, to have the record and stats we have right now, it shows we’re going in the right direction.”

Wakulla War Eagles (0-8)

Snapshot: While the War Eagles went winless and failed to score during an 0-3 weekend in the Bronze bracket, Wakulla’s fourth-year program has improved drastically from previous Classic appearances. Losses to Leon (6-0), Pompano Beach (20-0), and Navarre (15-0) all came with improved play from red zone to red zone.

Quotable: “The girls are finally starting to believe in each other, believe in the team,” first-year Wakulla head coach Paul Rivera said. “We know we’re ‘This close.’ All day, it was just a couple mistakes here or there.”",http://rssfeeds.tallahassee.com/~/600514122/0/tallahassee/home~Rickards-wins-Silver-championship-at-Capital-City-Classic-flag-football-tournament/,2019-04-07T13:46:47Z,Tallahassee Democrat,Couple,"277 N Magnolia Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA",FL,32301

1491,'Queer Miami' exhibit looks at LGBTQ community past century,"MIAMI — The first thing you notice when walking into the new ""Queer Miami"" exhibit are voices. They echo in the background — and all around — and become clearer as you stroll deeper inside the HistoryMiami Museum in downtown Miami.

They are voices of transgender performers talking about their craft. They are the voices of gay Mariel refugees who carved a new life in Miami in 1980 after fleeing Fidel Castro's Cuba. And they are voices of protestors of gay discrimination ordinances in the 1970s.

Tied to the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion, the exhibit looks back at 100 years of crimes and discrimination against Miami's LGBTQ communities and how they made their voices heard through community development, the gay rights movement and same-sex marriage.

Miami native Julio Capo Jr. curated the exhibit, which opened March 16 and will remain up through Sept. 1 at the museum, 101 W. Flagler St.

""It's an exciting — and most necessary — time to tell these stories,"" said Capo, an associate professor of history at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and an expert of gender and sexuality.

""One of the greatest challenges in studying LGBTQ history is that our lives and experiences are so often purposefully erased from history books and archives,"" he said. ""As this exhibit will show, our LGBTQ community, of which I am also a proud member, has persisted and persevered in Miami since its inception.""

Housed in a 5,000-square-foot gallery on the second floor of the museum, the exhibit uses a mix of historical documents, news articles, testimonials and memorabilia to document gay history.

A series of panels detail Florida's early laws and ordinances that criminalized same-sex behaviors as well as female and male impersonator stage shows.

Black and white footage captured raids in the 1950s and 60s at Miami Beach and Miami bars known for catering to gays and lesbians. There's also surveillance video of men sunbathing at Miami Beach's 21st street and Collins Avenue, a popular gathering spot for gay men in the 1960s and 1970s.

A wall of photos features couples and people holding signs describing their professions in Miami's first LGBT parade in 1978. Archival material highlights Anita Bryant's statewide ""Save Our Children"" campaign to repeal a Dade County ordinance that banned discrimination against gays, lesbians and bisexuals.

Nearby, a display reflects on the early AIDS crisis with TV footage of early diagnoses in 1981 and how Florida ""had more cases than almost any other state"" in 1983. Articles and photos tell the story of Pedro Zamora, the Cuban-American AIDS educator who shared his struggles of living with HIV positive on MTV's ""The Real World"" in 1994 before his death.

A display case holds T-shirts, passes and programs from The White Party, an annual Miami event launched in 1984 to raise funds for AIDS/HIV programs at the Health Crisis Network, now known as Care Resource.

The exhibit also dedicated an area to LGBTQ immigration and its impact on South Florida.

A video interview shows a couple, Luis Molina and Rolando Zerquera, recalling how they pretended to be straight to flee Cuba during the 1980 Mariel boat lift.

The men describe how they swapped partners with a lesbian couple to protect themselves from being accused as gay during their voyage to Miami.

At the end of the exhibit, where a giant installation of rainbow-colored ribbons hangs from the ceiling, visitors are invited to write their own LGBTQ stories on index cards.

""There are many Queer Miami stories. Share yours,"" reads a message on a wall.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190406/queer-miami-exhibit-looks-at-lgbtq-community-past-century?rssfeed=true,2019-04-06T17:28:55Z,Daytona Beach News,Couple,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
1492,Volusia County holds all vote-by-mail election,"- Volusia County’s Elections Office looks like Santa’s Workshop right now, except the elves are staffers and volunteers and the gifts are envelopes stuffed with mail-in ballots on a propose half cent sales tax.

It’s a unique special election process in Volusia County.

“We have done a couple mail ballot elections for a few small cities, but as a county-wide endeavor, no. This is a first for Volusia County,” said Volusia County Supervisor of Elections Lisa Lewis.

The reason?

“It is a little less money to do it by mail.” It’s $70,000-$80,000 less than doing a special election with polling places and so “we will be ready.”

This is quite the operation they have here. It's like an assembly line of stuffing in this room and then when you come into this room, we've got people doing postage and some sorting. They say the only thing that this is all missing is a conveyor belt.

“It's like a round robin. We just keep going like this.”

With nearly 400,000 registered voters in the county, this is no small feat.

“You have to pull the correct ballots for the correct envelopes to be mailed to the correct people,” said Lewis.

In ten days, with 20 to 25 people each day, they’ve stuffed, sorted and done postage for about 290,000 ballots. All of the ballots will be mailed out May 1st and are due back to the office by May 21st. These same folks can count the ballots.

Luckily, “opening them is a lot easier than putting them together.”

They’re hoping that mailing home ballots will make the election more convenient for voters.

“We're hoping with this one, we may get a higher turnout.”

And that may just be worth the work of Santa’s elves.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/volusia-county-mail-in-ballots-go-out-for-half-cent-sales-tax-proposal,2019-04-06T13:28:39Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,Couple,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

1499,Uneasy tomato truce ending between Florida and Mexico,"It's what the Florida Tomato Exchange, a trade organization, alleges is an effort by Mexican growers to dump artificially low-priced tomatoes on the American market. That, they say, is undermining American farms.

Florida tomato growers have no shortage of challenges these days. Development is encroaching on the best farmland. There are issues of climate change and access to fresh water, pest problems and soil problems, heat and humidity, and the threat of hurricanes. Labor costs are high.

But, according to growers, the biggest challenge isn't in Florida at all.

It's what the Florida Tomato Exchange, a trade organization, alleges is an effort by Mexican growers to dump artificially low-priced tomatoes on the American market. That, they say, is undermining American farms.

The exchange made the case in front of the U.S. Trade Commission on Thursday, arguing that the Department of Commerce should terminate a 22-year-old agreement that had attempted to maintain the peace between Florida and Mexican tomato growers.

The pact, known as the Tomato Suspension Agreement, is to halt anti-dumping investigations by Commerce and requires tomato growers in both countries to agree to a minimum price for imports. This floor price has been renegotiated several times, but the exchange filed the action in November after concluding that they could not come to another agreement that would work for both sides.

Mexican growers deny that there has been dumping. Rather, they say, Florida hasn't remained competitive in producing quality tomatoes at an affordable price. In the increasingly cutthroat fresh produce industry, only those companies that produce efficiently and consistently succeed.

""The Mexicans would like to make this into a taste test, or who has the better natural environment for growing tomatoes,"" says Michael Schadler, executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Exchange. ""Those are applicable for a broader debate, but a dumping case is very specific. You can go into the marketplace and see prices that are at dumping value. ""

Robert LaRussa, a lawyer representing the Mexican growers, says the Florida growers are asking the Mexicans to jump through too many hoops. He says the Florida growers are demanding not only that the Mexicans adhere to a floor price upon first domestic sale but also in every subsequent sale. He says this is nearly impossible to track and unfairly penalizes Mexican growers (tomatoes, an ephemeral product, are worth less as they get squishy and closer to marinara-ville). The exchange filed the request to terminate in November because the Mexican growers refused to extend the agreement to downstream sales unless someone could establish that it was legal.

If the Florida growers prevail in their efforts, it could be a boon to the domestic market by raising prices on Mexico tomatoes by 17 percent. Some of those costs, however, would be passed on to consumers, and Mexico could consider new agricultural tariffs of its own.

The fight is central to preserving the Florida tomato industry, which has shrunk sharply over the past 20 years, one of several key agricultural industries to have seen steep declines - citrus being the biggest example.

Mexican growers say their Florida counterparts are using this moment of anti-Mexican, anti-NAFTA sentiment to snatch back market share.

The exchange contends that because of loopholes and an agreement structure hard to enforce, U.S. tomato production declined by 34 percent, from 4.4 billion pounds to 2.9 billion pounds, between 2002 and 2017. Mexican tomato imports to the U.S. skyrocketed 225 percent from 1.6 billion pounds to 3.6 billion pounds in that period.

The exchange says hundreds of U.S. tomato growers have been forced out of business as a result of what they perceive to be a violation of fair-trade practices. But there are reasons Florida tomato growers are the biggest losers in the face of Mexico's gains.

Historically, Florida has a market advantage by producing certain crops - tomatoes, blueberries, strawberries - during the winter, when the state's farmers are the only people on the planet to do so. In recent years, their winter dominance has been challenged by Mexico.

This is partially why California, which also grows lots of tomatoes, has not entered the fray. California's season for fresh tomatoes is during the summer and, perhaps more importantly, that state's focus is on canning. The state produces 95 percent of the country's canned tomatoes - with lots exported to Mexico.

""Fresh and canned tomatoes are apples and oranges,"" says Bruce Rominger of Pacific Coast Producers, a canned tomato company in California. ""Florida competes more directly with Mexico. ""

Rominger says that Florida may be at a disadvantage because of climate problems, but that labor cost is the chief reason Florida tomato farmers have become less competitive.

The North American Free Trade Agreement has seen successful U.S. exports to Mexico of agricultural products with less intensive field work demands, such as mechanized row crops like corn, soy and wheat, as well as dairy, pork and beef. But there's been a rise of imports to the U.S. of higher-field-work products like fresh fruits and vegetables.

""The NAFTA deal has winners and losers,"" Rominger said. ""We sell a lot of corn to Mexico. But there are going to be losers, and people in high-labor businesses have a tougher time competing with Mexico. ""

Over the past couple of decades, he's seen melons, asparagus, strawberries and other fruits and vegetables that are picked by hand moving out of the San Joaquin Valley in California and into Baja, Mexico.

""I don't know if consumers know that their produce is being picked by people earning $10 per day,"" he said.

Despite the fact that both products are picked by hand, often by Mexicans, Mexican tomatoes and Florida tomatoes may be apples and oranges, too.

Schadler explains that Florida tomatoes are generally grown in open fields; Mexican growers have invested in greenhouses, which have advantages. Eighty-five percent of Florida fresh tomatoes are harvested firm and green, transported, reddened with ethylene gas and sold to food service where machine sliceability is advantageous (think the perfect thin rounds of tomato on every hamburger). Mexican tomatoes go to the retail market because they are harvested ripe and are unblemished by the elements.

Even with a fatter slice of the tomato pie taken by Mexico, fresh tomatoes are big business. A recent Department of Agriculture study says per capita fresh tomato consumption was 12 pounds in the early 1980s but had topped 20 pounds by 2017.

The source of the increased enthusiasm, according to the USDA? Emerging production technology and growing imports, often of greenhouse-grown specialty tomatoes - heirlooms and cherries and grape tomatoes - from Mexico.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190323/uneasy-tomato-truce-ending-between-florida-and-mexico?rssfeed=true,2019-03-23T09:50:00Z,Panama City News Herald,Couple,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA",FL,32401
