2,2,"Florida girl screams, runs for help as car follows her home","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. (WESH)— An emotional mother shared the details of a frightening moment involving her child.

She said her middle school daughter was followed home from school on Thursday and approached by a man in a car with a camera.

That student and her family spoke exclusively with WESH 2's Kelsi Thorud about what they said was a situation that could have ended much differently.

""It's just shocking because if I didn't do (anything), if I didn't run or anything, he probably would have gotten out of the car and probably grabbed me,"" the young girl said.

The sixth-grade student, who does not wish to be identified by WESH 2 News, said she was walking home from Freedom Middle School Thursday afternoon when she noticed a man in a black car.

""He's like, old looking, and he has a camera in his hand and he's smiling at me and telling, with his finger, telling me to come here,"" she said.

The girl said she immediately felt uncomfortable, so she started running.

""I run and he's still following me, and when he's still following me, I'm about over there, and I'm running and crying and screaming, 'Help me,' so someone could come and stuff,"" the child said.

Part of it was caught on surveillance video from the apartment complex the girl lives in.

In the video, the child is seen running to the gate, and a black car is seen pulling in right behind her.

""I could sense my daughter was scared by the way she was running. I've never seen her run like that before,"" the girl's mother said.

The girl's mother said she truly believes the man in the car wanted to take her daughter.

""It's a parent's worst nightmare to see something like that, and to know that there's people out there watching children like that, to try to take them or do whatever they want to do with them,"" she said.

The family said they've filed a police report and now they just want to warn parents in the area.

""Talk to your kids. Let them know stuff like this can happen. You may not think it can or will, but it does happen,"" the child's mother said.

The Orange County Sheriff's Office says it is investigating this incident.",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-girl-screams-runs-for-help-as-car-follows-her-home/1996636840,2019-05-11T20:31:52Z,WFLA,Couple,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
36,59,12-year-old Florida girl hopes to save lives with car seat invention,"UMATILLA — A Umatilla Middle School student who won first place at the state science fair in March is now pursuing a patent for her life-saving technology.

Seventh-grader Alexandra “Lexie” Clow won $750 in prize money after her project, called the pediatric heat stroke prevention device, earned her a spot in the international BroadCom competition in Washington D.C. She’s also won awards at the Lockheed Martin Science Challenge in Orlando, netting her an additional $400.

“I haven’t spent a cent of the money I’ve won,” Lexie said. “I want to put it all toward the patent.”

The patent would protect the core mechanics of her device, a car seat designed to alert people when a baby has been left in a hot car, as she continues to promote and develop it.

Lexie and her family decided a couple months ago to pursue the patent as she prepared to go to the state science fair for her second year of competition.

“We thought, hey, let’s help her get a patent on this,” father Rick Clow said. “It’s not really a big deal.”

As they came to find out, it was a bigger deal than they expected.

You might think the patent process is inexpensive and simple, but Rick Clow said the U.S. Patent Office has become the domain of lawyers more than the average person.

Companies have lawyers to handle the process, but individuals have to seek out specialized attorneys.

In the meantime, the family has registered Lexie's project as patent pending, which Clow said was a simple and accessible first step.

To get the rest of the way, the family has started a GoFundMe campaign describing the project and asking for $15,000 to navigate the patent process.

Currently, the GoFundMe is sitting at $1,410. One $100 donation came from the Lake County Sheriff’s Office, which also gave Lexie a signal boost for her project after she won the science fair.

Lexie hopes to secure the patent prior to the international science fair in October, where it will go before an international audience.

She also wants the patent so she can take the device to the next level of development. Currently, the device works with a mostly wired system and a few radio frequency transmitters.

It's an independently powered car seat that gets hooked into a car's electronics in order to turn on the lights and honk the horn when it detects the weight of a baby and heat around 104 degrees Fahrenheit. It activates cooling fans to increase a baby's chances of surviving, and the seat also has bright blue LEDs on the side to draw the eye straight toward the seat.

Lexie said she hopes it can be developed as an accessory to smarter cars, with an app to alert parents who are walking away from their car without their child because, yes, it happens.

Ideally, it would even be a part of the car, rather than a standalone seat, she said.

Lexie said her goal was to keep the technology affordable. She used cheap, easily accessible components so it could be replicated for just a few hundred dollars.

""I want to fix something that's a problem locally for us,"" Lexie said. When she found out Florida had the second most pediatric heat stroke deaths in the U.S., she decided it was a preventable problem and she wanted to solve it.

58 children died of heat stroke in 2018, she said, one of which occurred in Sanford. Lexie thinks she can help lower that number.

Help Lexie on her journey for a patent!

Three-year-old Trinity was diagnosed with neuroblastoma last year; she also has Homer’s syndrome and Harliquine syndrome, leaving her a veteran of the operating room and chemotherapy care.

According to WFLA, Trinity loves her father’s tattoos, so her mother called Ink Wolves and made a special request: temporary tattoos for a little girl with a lot of fight in her.

Employees came in on their day off and tatted Trinity with Disney characters and fun designs on her arms and legs, WFLA said.

61,96,Florida girl who requires an extremely rare blood type to survive undergoes major milestone,"- A Florida girl who requires an extremely rare blood type to survive has completed a potentially life-changing surgery.

OneBlood reported on Wednesday that three-year-old Zainab Mughal has completed the most complicated and exhausting part of her cancer treatment. On Monday, she underwent her second bone marrow transplant and received multiple blood transfusions.

It will still reportedly be several months before it is known if Zainab's cancer has been put into remission, but her doctors told OneBlood that she is a ""superhero"" and that they believe she is on the road to recovery.

Zainab still needs additional treatments, OneBlood said in their press release. It is likely that she will need additional blood transfusions as she enters the next phase of her treamtment.

To be a match for Zainab, OneBlood says the following must be met:

Must be exclusively Pakistani, Indian or Iranian descent – meaning the donor’s birth parents are both 100% Pakistani, Indian or Iranian

Must be blood type “O” or “A”

All donations for Zainab must be coordinated with OneBlood in advance to ensure the additional compatibility testing is performed.

OneBlood has found only five compatible donors for Zainab so far. Two are from the United States, two from the United Kingdom, and one from Australia. The five donors have consistently donated each time that they are eligible. They have played a significant role in saving Zainab's life.

120,174,10-year-old Florida girl is attacked by shark on her birthday,"A little girl experienced a shark attack in Florida and walked away with 40 stitches. Her parents say she is ready to get back to the beach and swim in the ocean.

When a 10-year-old was swimming in the ocean at Crescent Beach near Daytona, her parents thought she might’ve been stung by a jellyfish. But she was actually attacked by a shark, News4Jax reported.

According to the report, Peyton Shields shoved the shark when it bit both her legs. It then got a hold of her arm and bit her there. As she continued shoving, the shark swam away.

Her father was surprised the attack occurred.

""My daughter got bitten by a shark. It's, like, I don't know anybody who has been bitten by a shark. Lucky Peyton."" Steve Shields, Peyton's father, told News4Jax.

Both of Peyton’s parents put pressure on the bite wounds and called 911. Soon after, she was taken to Flagler Hospital. She left the hospital with 40 stitches and continued celebrating her birthday a few days later.

Peyton Shields is already looking forward to her next beach trip. “The shark’s gone. I’m ready to get back in,” Peyton told her father. Steve Sheilds says his daughter is brave.

""We live in Florida. There’s sharks. There’s alligators. We’re going to go swim in the lake. We’re going to swim in the ocean. It is what it is,” Steve said.

Haines City Police Department said that there was a domestic dispute at the Citrus Ridge Apartments on Friday night. They say that 38-year-old Ernst Cherizard shot 23-year-old Eli Normil and her daughter, Elizabelle.

When Normil's family came to check on her, Cherizard reportedly told them she wasn't there. Her aunt, 48-year-old Nicole Guillume, returned to the apartment and an argument ensued. That's when police say Cherizard shot Guillume, killing her.

When officers arrived to the scene, they found Eli and Normil dead. Elizabelle was alive but brain dead. She was shot three times, including once in the head. Elizabelle was transported to the Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando. She was pronounced dead late on Saturday night, despite doctor's efforts to save her life.

Police are still searching for the suspected gunman, Ernest Cherizard. They say that he fled in a burgundy 2011 Nissan Altima, license plate GZN C82. He is armed and dangerous. A toll booth 200 miles away near Fort Lauderdale recorded the plate early Saturday.

The victims' family is stunned. “I was traumatized,” said Normil’s brother, Annel, “I spoke to her two days ago and she was like 'I'm doing good bro, I'm working.' She's the manager at one of the fast food restaurants in the Haines City area.”

“I don't really know him that much. He always talk to me like he care for my sister. That he want to marry her, one day. He always seemed cool to me. I don't think he would ever have done something like that,” Annel Normil added.
