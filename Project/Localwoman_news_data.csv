Officers were called to the restaurant on Atlantic Boulevard and Brookview Drive just before 2:30 a.m. Monday. The shooting took place in the back of the restaurant where Aggravated Battery Detectives and Crime Scene detectives could be seen processing the scene.

The woman was found with one gunshot wound and was transported to a nearby hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Detectives are working to determine a motive for the shooting. While no suspects are in custody, investigators said they were provided with descriptions for three unknown individuals. Part of their investigation will include interviewing the woman who was injured.

Residents nearby said they didn’t hear anything and shootings are not common in the area.

PLACERVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A Northern California woman has been arrested on suspicion of abusing four girls she adopted.

The El Dorado County Sheriff’s office said 63-year-old Patricia Taylor was an adoptive mother to the girls, ranging from 11 to 16 years old, and had fostered and adopted several other children in the past who’ve moved out.

An investigation was launched in April when a 14-year-old girl ran away from Taylor’s home in Placerville and told authorities about years of abuse. Detectives talked to Taylor’s other adopted daughters and they made similar allegations.

Taylor was arrested Thursday and booked for investigation of torture, child abuse, false imprisonment, willful cruelty to a child and lewd and lascivious conduct of a child. She’s being held on nearly $1.5 million bail. It wasn’t immediately known if she had a lawyer who could speak on her behalf.

9,Neighbors identify woman found dead with dead man in Nocatee home,"NOCATEE, Fla. - Neighbors identify the woman found dead in a Nocatee home Saturday as Lynn Bender. That name matches what public records show about who lived at this home. Bender worked as a realtor for Remax. She lives one street over and she was supposed to host an open house at this home yesterday morning from 11 to 2 and when she didn't show up, that's when people started making calls.

The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office responded Saturday afternoon to investigate the suspicious deaths of a man and woman at 203 Southern Oak Drive in Nocatee.

Neighbor said their neighbor called her boss who called her family member who then came to check on her and found her and a man dead inside.

The St Johns County Sheriff's office has not released the details involving how the two died or the relationship. But the Clerk of Courts website shows Bender had filed a petition for an injunction against a man named Simon Hanley in December 2018. The injunction was filed against stalking violence.

Neighbors say they saw an odd man in the past at her home.

""She had taken out a restraining order against someone and the particular person was the one that I know now was odd and we should've cautioned her against spending time with him but she had a big heart and she couldn't help but want to help others,"" said neighbor Jane Amorim.

Neighbors say it was a rough night for them and people are torn up about this.

People are posting on facebook that she was a really sweet person and sending prayers to her loved ones.

20,Florida man who stood on sunroof while driving accused of felony domestic violence,"POLK COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA ) - A driver made a lot of people laugh this week when he stood up on his sunroof with his car on cruise control while driving on Interstate 4. But the story behind the story isn't funny at all.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office said 70-year-old Leonard Olsen was arrested not only for driving recklessly, but also for false imprisonment and domestic violence by strangulation.

RELATED: Florida man arrested for hanging out sunroof while driving on I-4

According to an arrest report, Olsen is accused of choking a 69-year-old woman on April 30 after she took too long to come to bed. The woman told deputies she had bruises on her throat and a hoarse voice.

Days later, after the woman came home from dinner, he allegedly ripped up the dress she had been wearing, accused her of having an affair and called her a vulgar name. Then he asked her for one of her bras and threatened to destroy every bra in her dresser. When she eventually gave him a bra, he tore it apart and demanded that she give him the pair of underwear she had been wearing. When she told him she was still wearing the underwear, he began ""pulling on the underwear causing the victim's body to shake back and forth until the underwear came loose from the victim's body,"" an arrest report states.

Once he was through destroying all of her clothing, Olsen began blaring music so she couldn't fall asleep. This lasted several hours, according to the victim.

The next day, the victim awoke to Olsen slamming dresser drawers, turning the lights on and off, and blaring music. Deputies said he pushed her onto their bed, straddled her and put his hand on her throat, then placed his thumb on her mouth, which she bit. Olsen got off of her and blocked the doorway to prevent her from leaving the room. After a few minutes, he let her pass through the doorway and she called 911.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office said detectives made contact with Olsen by phone on Tuesday and he agreed to turn himself in.

As deputies were on their way to meet him, they learned he had been pulled over by the Florida Highway Patrol for driving recklessly.

Olsen was arrested and booked into the South County Jail, where he faces three counts of felony domestic battery on a person 65 or older, one count of felony false imprisonment and one count of felony domestic battery by strangulation.",http://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/lakeland-man-who-stood-on-sunroof-while-driving-accused-of-felony-domestic-violence/1997065259,2019-05-12T03:59:05Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

33,Behind the phone lines with 911 dispatchers,"ORLANDO, Fla. - “What’s your emergency?”

Gregory Johnston, a dispatcher with Orange County Fire Rescue, calmly responds to what is being described as one woman’s extremely bad day.

The woman started having chest pains which led her into a car accident earlier in April in Apopka.

Johnston sat in a darkly lit room, most of the illumination coming from the seven computer screens he has in front of him, while listening to the caller.

In the span of about 60 seconds, Johnston obtained the location, the nature of the problem, a call back number, provided the nearest fire department with appropriate information and reassured the woman that everything was going to be OK.

Everything Johnston gathered and performed in that 60 seconds is standard operation in the life of dispatch.

It’s often overlooked when thinking about emergency operations.

The hours are long.

The job is thankless.

The turnover is high, and yet Orange County Fire Rescue’s dispatchers are one of the most important cogs in the emergency response machine.

Johnston, an assistant supervisor who has been with dispatch for more than 20 years, has seen a lot of folks come and go.

“This job is not for everybody,” Johnston said. “If you can’t deal with stress or you take things personally or you don’t like long hours, this is not the job for you.”

OCFR has one of the largest coverage zones in the Sunshine State, as a result the dispatch receives a huge amount of calls — 124,006 just from 2018, according to OCFR’s annual report.

The dispatch center is currently understaffed with 36 employees. The 2018 annual report listed 57 dispatchers at the end of the year.

Currently the department is seeking to fill out its ranks to 52 dispatchers.

As things stand right now, dispatchers are working on average an additional 20 hours of overtime tacked onto their 40 hour work weeks.

“Oh, I’m sure they want to hire more people as fast as they can,” Johnston said laughing about overtime. “The long hours, that’s truly the hardest part — being away from your family so long.”

On the topic of family, there are some rare occurrences where a dispatcher picks up the phone and a family member is on the other line having an emergency.

“It’s pretty rare, but it does happen from time to time,” Johnston said.

Like the time Johnston picked up the line and listened to his aunt enter a cardiac event in 2015.

Barbara Young, 82 at the time, called 911. Johnston picked up the phone and recognized his aunt’s voice.

“It was a little more than personal for me than anything before,” he said.

But he stayed professional, got the essential information and his aunt survived.

“911 dispatchers are the actual lifeline between those who need help and those emergency personnel who respond to that need,” said Orange County Mayor Jerry L. Demings in reference to National Telecommunicators Week observed earlier in April. “While they often work behind the scenes, what they do is so critical. I’m very much appreciative of their service, as are the many residents and visitors in our community who have had to call upon them in their moment of need.”

Dispatchers abide by a very strict guideline of responses for the most common kinds of scenarios. The call center’s stringent process earned it an accreditation from the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch, which is a global organization which recognizes emergency call centers that exemplify the standard of excellence.

Christopher Englehart, 27, started work as a dispatcher earlier this year. He was a former cake decorator at Publix Super Markets.

One of the big reasons that motivated Englehart to join dispatch was watching the men and women who served on June 12, 2016 after the massacre at the Pulse Night Club, Englehart said.

“Watching the Sheriff’s Office and Fire Rescue do what they did that day, it moved me into this field as well,” he said. “I want to help people.”

Some of the more common calls the center receives are concerns about chest pain, but Englehart’s first call was about a bomb threat at Wekiva High School.

Six weeks before, he was training on the first floor of Orange County Fire Rescue’s headquarters, beneath the call center, and going over how to respond to various scenarios. He was already reasonably nervous on his first day of the job but his first call didn’t leave him time to think about his anxiety. He said it pushed him into the deep end of the pool and — to his surprise — he began swimming.

“There’s no amount of preparation downstairs that they can give you that will completely prepare you for up here,” Englehart said.

He recorded the information about possible suspects in the area armed with weapons and informed the fire crew where to go until Orange County Sheriff’s Office gave the all clear.

Luckily, it was a false alarm, but the experience acclimated Englehart quickly.

“People on the street don’t know I am a dispatcher,” Englehart said. “It’s one of those jobs that you never see. You just hear about it. And while everyone wants to be recognized for what they do, making sure people get what they need is what is most important to me.”

The woman allegedly took the girl to a health clinic -- where she got an implantable birth control device. She was supposed to be taking her to school.

Misty Evans says her daughter has babysat for the woman's daughter in the past-- and even slept over at her house. The Pennsylvania Department of Health says federal law prohibits clinicians from requiring parental consent to get birth control.

Evans said what concerns her is her daughter did not want the contraceptive.

""The family friend forced her and told her she had to have it because she was 12 years old,"" Evans said.

Evans said she has seen paperwork where the woman claimed to be her daughter's aunt. She her daughter was so shaken by the experience that she didn't admit it until a month after it happened.

According to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, Jeymie Wescott, 35, was at the fast food restaurant on Tuesday when deputies received reports of a woman yelling from inside the bathroom.

When they arrived, they said Wescott ""showed several indicators of narcotics usage."" According to an arrest affidavit, after Wescott consented to a search, a deputy ""felt something hard"" near the woman's groin area and Westcott yelled an expletive.

After refusing to tell deputies what she was hiding, she reportedly was taken to jail where, according to deputies, she pulled out 7 syringes from her private area that had a ""clear substance inside.""

41,Deputies: Mother arrested after leaving 2 children alone outside jail,"YULEE, Fla. - When a 27-year-old Yulee woman showed up at the Nassau County jail during visiting hours to visit an inmate, she likely had no idea she would go from being a visitor to an inmate herself.

Deputies said they arrested the woman late Thursday afternoon on a charge of leaving a child older than 6 but under younger than 15 unattended. News4Jax has chosen not to name her because it is a misdemeanor charge.

According to the arrest report, a deputy was called to the detention center after staff members noticed two children left unattended in the woman's car.

The report states the car was on and so was the air conditioner, but no one was supervising the children during the 20 minutes their mother was away from the car.

According to the report, when the deputy spoke to the woman, she said she left her children in the car because she didn’t have anyone else to watch them. She also told the deputy that she was not sure if children were allowed inside the detention center.

The deputy noted in the report that because the woman failed to provide the children with proper supervision, he placed her under arrest and had her booked into the jail on $5,000 bond.

It’s unclear whether the Department of Children and Families was called or who took possession of the children while their mother was in jail.

In February, another mother was arrested at the jail after deputies said she drove to the jail intoxicated with her three children in the car.

42,"Woman says boyfriend choked and punched her, so she stabbed him, according to ECSO","A Pensacola man was arrested after his girlfriend told investigators that he abused her throughout the day until she ultimately stabbed him in self-defense.

Calvin Williams, 50, was arrested Monday while he was still a patient at Baptist Hospital, where he was receiving treatment for a puncture wound.

He was charged with two counts of battery, false imprisonment and violation of a domestic violence injunction. His bond was set at $45,000.

According to an arrest report, the woman told deputies that Williams, her boyfriend of eight years, had physically abused her May 5. She said that despite an active domestic violence injunction stipulating that Williams have no contact with her, she allowed him to live with her to help pay rent.

The woman told deputies that around 8 p.m., she was sitting in the driver’s seat of Williams' car while he sat in the backseat directly behind her and Williams reached for her neck from behind and began choking her, the report stated.

The woman told deputies she could not talk nor breath because of his grasp, the report stated. Before he let go, Williams also punched her multiple times in the face, the woman told authorities.

Later in the evening at around 10 p.m., the woman told investigators Williams again starting punching her face while they were at home, the report stated.

The woman told deputies that she retreated to the kitchen, picked up a knife and told her boyfriend to let her leave. She said Williams blocked a doorway and her exit out of the home and refused to move.

In fear for her life, the woman said she stepped toward Williams, asked him to allow her to leave one more time and, when he refused, she stabbed the knife into his chest, according to the report.

The woman told investigators that before Williams drove away from the home, he said to her, ""B----, I can’t believe you stabbed me,"" according to the report.

Williams drove himself to West Florida Hospital’s Perdido Emergency Room on U.S. 98 before medical personnel later transported him to Baptist Hospital’s trauma unit.

Investigators observed “excessive” redness and swelling around the woman's left eye socket, bruises on her legs, a bruise on her chin and three large purplish bruises on her arm, the report stated.

Sometimes you have to wait for what you really want. You may not have told everyone about your dream. You might have been hesitant to reveal the depth of your fantasy. But if you’re ready when the magical opportunity comes — you’ll jump at the chance and your dreams can come true.

Especially if you want to be a mermaid.

A mermaid? OK. An unusual obsession perhaps, but where is it written that a 67-year-old grandmother, wife of a prominent retired physician, a garden designer, former beekeeper and environmentalist can’t also have fantasized about living the good life under the waves, wriggling her tail in graceful arcs and fraternizing with benevolent turtles and fish?

Buy Photo Jo Ostrov, a woman who always wanted to be a mermaid at Weeki Watchi Springs State Park, in her backyard which she turned into a mermaid lagoon Friday, April 26, 2019. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

For one Tallahassee woman who has actually worn the flippers — nowhere is it written!

Jo Ostrov sits on the edge of a hot tub beneath a garden gazebo. Above her is a sign indicating we have entered an outdoor sanctum she calls her Mermaid Lagoon. Though not a watery lagoon per se, it is where Ostrov repairs to soak up the ambiance she has created in the little garden grotto.

Surrounded with table-sized clam shells, and smaller exotic shells from the Phillippines, Hawaii, Costa Rica, and Japan, Ostrov has adorned herself with colorful, exotic mollusk jewelry at her wrists, neck and ears. Mermaid statuary is nearby and the entire “lagoon” palette is touched with aqua… including the color of Ostrov’s nails. “I am a “water person,” she says matter-of-factly. “My husband is a land-man, but he respects my need to be near and in the water every day.”

Buy Photo Jo Ostrov, a woman who always wanted to be a mermaid at Weeki Watchi Springs State Park, in her backyard which she turned into a mermaid lagoon Friday, April 26, 2019. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

And she means it. Ostrov swims at Premier Health and Fitness pool four or five times a week. Her five garden venues include small ponds, bubbling fountains, and winding streams. And she is never happier than when on the yearly vacations the couple has made to Hawaii since the '80s, Ostrov finds herself swimming in the clear, warm waters of Kauai.

Other favorite venues to interact with dolphins, turtles, and commune with whales, will find her snorkeling, scuba-diving, or body surfing beside youths a third her age. Jo Ostrov was most definitely cut out to be a mermaid. Yet it might not have been so.

“I was born in Akron,” she says. “One of nine children, we didn’t go to fancy country clubs to learn to swim, but rather to one of Ohio’s muddy lakes where a Red Cross instructor would oversee our progress. My mother, sitting on the sand, never really learned.”

Buy Photo Jo Ostrov, a woman who always wanted to be a mermaid at Weeki Watchi Springs State Park, in her backyard which she turned into a mermaid lagoon Friday, April 26, 2019. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

In high school, Ostrov was in the school pool every day of summer, later becoming a life guard at Ohio State. She added swimming with the synchronized team and got her scuba certification before heading off for her initial experience with the “real ocean,” her first visit to Hawaii. The underwater beauty of corals and animal life, the colors, the currents touched something in Ostrov that she has yet to still. Nor would she want to.

Fast forward nearly 50 years. Along with other trends like Princesses, Unicorns and Pet Rocks, Mermaids began to have their day. Everyone from little girls, to big girls and their mothers seemed to have awakened to Ariel and the allure of the deep. Mermaid toys, blankets, jewelry, even pet outfits came to market.

Even more unusual, adult women could pop for $300 “seamless, neoprene/Silicone, swimmable tails.” And three and half hours south of Tallahassee, though marginally operational, there existed a venerable Florida attraction that for all the ways time had passed it by, knew that at least it had something the public could still get excited about. Weeki Wachee Springs State Park had Mermaids!

In 1947, Newt Perry had built the roadside “pull-‘um’in” in the crystal clear waters of Weeki Watchee Springs. Within its craggy underwater geography, he contrived a giant shoot called the “Tunnel” through which 35 mostly local girls would drop themselves into the water and emerge from under a stony shelf to frolic and wave at visitors behind giant plate glass windows, awing Midwestern holiday crowds at seeing “real mermaids” cavorting in the deep. And then Disney Inc. brought the whole operation to a near sputtering stop.

Buy Photo A photograph of Jo Ostrov, a woman who always wanted to be a mermaid at Weeki Watchi Springs State Park, dressed at a mermaid. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

Yet despite the competition to the south and the mermaid vogue’s slow wane, Weeki Wachee has carried on — and parlayed a certain nostalgia into good business. Today Junior Mermaid camps and Sirens of the Deep camps, for those over 30, are $450 Sold Out affairs. From April to October, two-day “camps” are organized by former Weeki Wachee mermaids who mentor and coach those whose fantasies might have only grown over the years. Jo Ostrov, one of eight in each class, says the oldest woman in her camp group was 80.

“It was wonderful,” enthuses Ostrov. “I had practiced my dolphin kicks in the pool for a month before I went so my stomach muscles were ready! The hardest part really, was getting into the mermaid tail and hopping backwards on the deck to get into the water.” But once in, she says she found her joy. With clear spring water rushing from beneath the earth from a vent the size of a car, the water is 72 degrees.

“It feels wonderful when you first enter, but for every 45 minutes you spend in the water, you loose three degrees of body temperature,” said Ostrov. The amateur mermaids, all in their confining tails, spent four such sessions in the water each day practicing their “underwater pinwheels, backward dolphins, and flower swimming.”

Ostrov says that though campers don’t learn to use the long oxygen tubes reserved for the professional mermaids who are putting on shows right beside the campers, they did master keeping their eyes open for long periods, wearing a constant beatific smile, and slowly letting air out of their mouths so as not to pop to the surface in an unmermaid-like eruption.

“It was so definitely a delight,” says Jo Ostrov, who in the future yearns to take a granddaughter or two back to Weeki Watchee to wiggle into a tail. “Swimming with the ancient white flounders that live at the bottom of the springs, being shadowed by the huge turtles who seem to love to spend time with the “mermaids” was wonderful.”

And for Jo Ostrov, committed water person, it seems a basic bucket-list item has been checked off. One can perhaps even hear her humming the signature song of the mermaids of Weeki Wachee, a tongue-in-cheek, but very heart-felt, “I’ve Got the World by the Tail… sittin’ on a rainbow…” And in her case, it would very definitely be true.

It happened again.

For the second time in less than a month, a puppy has been found in a dumpster in Coachella, California. This time, the puppy that was found was badly burned, beaten, and had part of her tail cut off.

RELATED: Woman caught on camera dumping puppies behind store in Coachella

""She was found in a dumpster in Coachella, discarded in a plastic Walmart bag,"" The Animal Hope & Wellness Foundation wrote on Facebook. ""Someone rummaging through the trash heard her crying, took her to the owner of a local jewelry store, where she was rushed to emergency.""

The foundation has been caring for the weeks-old pit bull mix puppy, treating her horrific injuries.

""It appears as if she was burned with a caustic substance, or a metal object like an iron. She is only a few weeks old, had a portion of her tail cut off, and can not walk due to being beat and assaulted. Currently she is in intensive care at emergency on 24-hour monitoring.""

The foundation tells Fox 35 that the puppy's back legs are crushed and she may never walk again.

""We will do everything we can to hold whoever did this accountable, but will need the public's help.""

The foundation is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of whoever is responsible.

The daughter of the woman who found the puppy and pulled her out of the trash bin has named her Hope. A GoFundMe has been started to help pay for Hope's medical treatment.

A Palm Bay woman is suing the contractor she said she paid $20,000 for a roof repair she never got.Carrie Volpe said Alliance Group Contracting caused more damage to her house than she started with.She and her husband Joe ended up selling the house and taking the contractor to court.Other customers have lodged complaints against the company, too, according to the Florida Attorney General’s Office and the Better Business Bureau. “We thought we were going to have our dream house, our 5 acres, our country estate and we didn't. Not after they were done with it,” said Volpe.While living in Palm Bay in 2017, Volpe and her husband bought a Vero Beach house 30 miles away, believing it was worth renovating despite a previous fire in the attic that had destroyed some roof trusses.“We started fixing it up to renovate it because it was going to be the most beautiful house ever,” said Volpe.To fix the trusses and replace the tiles afterward, Volpe hired Alliance Contracting Group in Port St. Lucie, owned by Adam Ryckman.Volpe paid $20,000 down on March 25, 2017, so the work could begin. But she said despite repeated emails, calls and promises, all Alliance did in the next six months was remove some roof tiles -- breaking them in the process -- just in time for Hurricane Irma to roar through in August.“They left the roof exposed during Hurricane Irma so it just poured inside the house during the hurricane,” said Volpe. “And they left the windows open so the whole house got completely flooded. It caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages.”Ryckman told WPBF 25 News that wasn't true.“We took tiles off the roof to start our job and then she canceled the contract. The tiles are cosmetic, they're not water-tight. So you can take tiles off a house and it won't leak,” he said.Volpe said Alliance did finally put a tarp on the house weeks later, but then it was too late -- she says mold was setting in, attic wood was warping and the expenses were mounting.She filed a civil lawsuit against Ryckman asking for $324,000 in damages.“They took all of our money, then destroyed the inside of our house and then walked away,” Volpe said.And its not just a civil case arising out of this dispute -- Ryckman is facing a felony criminal charge stemming from the case.He’s charged with using his notary stamp on a notice of commencement that Volpe said she never signed nor saw.Volpe said she originally signed a notice of commencement with the company’s salesman on March 25, 2017, who notarized her signature.But when she went to the city to review her permit and file, she discovered a different notice of commencement, stamped by Ryckman.She claims he forged her signature on that document.In an interview with Port St. Lucie police before he was arrested last year, on suspicion of being responsible for the false signature and notarization, Ryckman told a detective he stamped the notice in his office.At that point, he already had been investigated by the state and found to been in violation of Florida's notary laws. The state required him to complete remedial action. Ryckman told police he had to retake the notary course.But he said he was just doing his customer a favor – saying Volpe signed two notices of commencement, one expired, and so to speed up the process, he notarized the other one.“Did you forge her signature?” the detective asked.“No,” Ryckman answered. Ryckman told police Volpe was just trying to get money out of him by making false allegations. He said she canceled the contract and went after him when she realized the original fire damage was so extensive, she'd have to replace her whole roof.“When she realized she'd have to pay more money she didn't want to do that and figured out a way for us to pay for it,” Ryckman said.Ryckman’s lawyer said they were still investigating the criminal case against him and had no comment at this time. “I think he should get his license taken away so he never does this to anyone else,” Volpe said.The Better Business Bureau offers these tips if you are considering hiring a roofing contractor:* Make sure you understand the full scope of the project. What exactly is the roofer going to do? Make sure you understand the pros and cons of the solutions and that everything is detailed in your contract.* Plan for bad weather. What happens if there is bad weather while your roof project is underway? Ask your roofer about what they will do to protect your home in the case of rain or storms.* Check your insurance coverage. If your project is for fixing damage, check your homeowner's insurance to see if your project is covered and how you should proceed if it is. * There are different contractors for different roofing systems. Roofing contractors may be certified to install specific types of roofs. You can check with the manufacturer to see if your contractor is certified for their system.For more information, you can visit the BBB website: https://www.bbb.org/article/tips/14082-bbb-tip-roofing-contractors>.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/woman-sues-roofing-company-claims-house-damaged-when-left-unprotected-during-hurricane/27439134,2019-05-11T02:52:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
63,Woman accused of causing March crash that killed bicyclist,"Jacksonville Sheriff's Office booking photo of Amber Borden, left, who is accused of leaving the scene of a March crash that killed Summer Black.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Police have charged a 21-year-old woman with hitting and killing a woman on a bicycle in March and driving away.

Police said Summer Black, 34, was riding east on Beach Boulevard near Southside Boulevard about 2:30 a.m. March 25 when she was struck from behind by a Kia, the driver of which proceeded to flee the scene. Black died of her injuries.

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said a tip led them to the car, but it took an additional seven weeks for them charge the driver, Amber Borden, with leaving the scene of a fatal accident.

Borden is being held on $10,000 bond.

The crash that killed Black was one of a number of crashes at the intersection, which the News4Jax I-TEAM determined to be a crash hot spot in Jacksonville.

Last year, the I-TEAM found the busy Southside intersection was the second most dangerous in Duval County, with 33 crashes.

The Florida Department of Transportation has seemingly noticed. It put out warnings about the dangers at the intersection and is making some plans.

FDOT awarded a grant in January to pay for overtime traffic deployments focused on increasing bicyclist and pedestrian safety in the area of Beach Boulevard from St. Johns Bluff Road to Parental Home Road and three other areas in Jacksonville.

A Florida woman was arrested after a second-grader in her care repeatedly showed up to school in clothes caked in filth and a backpack filled with ""hundreds"" of bugs, deputies in the Panhandle said.

The girl is one of five siblings ages 5 to 14 who lived in a ""filthy"" Milton home infested with roaches, soiled mattresses on the floor, piles of cat feces, no edible food, broken windows, and bags of trash throughout the home and yard, according to a Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office report.

77,Julee Cottage offers special glimpse into Pensacola history | John Appleyard,"Some years past, the University of West Florida gained the role of maintenance and hospitality for what is termed Pensacola's Historic District. The district is not large, yet its stories span more than a century, and staff from the university have brightened the appearance of the area, and provide excellent tours.

The bulk of the structures there date from the late 19th century, with a degree of Queen Anne styling. However, one structure stands forth. It is small, single-story and its exterior walls are unpainted. The building bears the name The Julee Cottage. The structure was erected sometime within the final years of Spanish ownership of Pensacola. Its very beginning is unknown, yet in time it came to be the home of a woman of color named Julee. She was present as a domestic slave in years when much was happening locally that was different. Julee fit into the last days of the 1700s, with a story remembered like this:

The economy of the late 1700s found European-produced household goods (pots, pans, metal containers) — traded by William Panton and John Leslie for skins and furs trapped by several native American tribesmen (upper and lower Creeks, Chickasaws and Harvesters). Annually the Indians brought their game to Pensacola, trading through an October encampment. When they departed, literally tons of skins/furs were here, almost ready for shipment to Europe, where they would become part of garments which had become popular. The skins were here, but Panton and Leslie knew from experience that the items must be properly dried before they began the voyage of several weeks. Failure to dry meant soiling or rot.

The traders thus maintained what they termed their ""Tanyard,"" a segment of the lower city that occupied several square blocks, with a framework of wooden risers on which the skins were rested. The drying process covered many weeks, and to provide labor, the traders had several slaves as household servants in their ""mansion,"" probably the largest building in the colony.

As 1800 approached, Panton was aging and ill; he and Leslie made plans to place the operation in the hands of Panton's nephews, the Forbes brothers. As Panton finalized his plans, he gave freedom to two of the house slave/servants, Robert and Julee, and gave $300 to each one. Robert's trail from that point is obscure, but Julee promptly used her funds to purchase an existing wooden cottage to become her home. She then took a second step. Julee made contacts with other black women who had gained their freedom, and she offered them shelter in her cottage. The local Spanish leaders smiled on this unusual arrangement, which passed forward an uncertain time until death claimed Julee.

Happily, the cottage has survived. It now occupies a location different from its site when Julee was there, but it has been preserved and is now part of the tour which the University of West Florida guides provide. As one traces the several steps noted, the cottage is — truly — a unique segment of local history, touching several elements that became part of the Five Flags story. The Tanyard was maintained for some years, and its slaves — well — they have disappeared with time.

80,"Family wins $6M after woman falls, left in heat and dies at assisted living facility","PORT ST LUCIE, Fla. (WPEC) - Six million dollars. That's how much a Port Saint Lucie family walked away with after winning a wrongful death lawsuit this weekend.



The family's matriarch, Kathleen Menard, died after falling and laying in the extreme heat.

Menard was a resident of the Harbor Place assisted living facility in Port St. Lucie.

In July 2017 Menard fell while walking outside.

They had given her a safety pendant, where if she falls, she can press the pendant to get help and the staff were to come out and help. But there was one big problem: the staff never told her the pendant didn't work outside,"" said Scott Mitchell Fischer, the family's attorney.

A visitor found Menard unconscious. She had suffered burns and a heatstroke. She died 87 days later.

Menard's family sued Port St. Lucie Retirement Investors. After over a year of legal dealings, the family found out this weekend that they won $6 million for the wrongful death of Menard.

""I'm hoping legislation will change and it'll also change for other people so nobody ever has to go through this. This is the worst thing I've ever dealt with in my life and I will never, ever live it down,"" said Menard's daughter.

The family hopes to pen a bill in Menard's name.

Lagoa, the first Cuban-American woman on the court, has been serving as a justice since the appointment. The Supreme Court, however, typically holds formal investiture ceremonies months after justices take office.

Lagoa, who had served a dozen years on the 3rd District Court of Appeal before the Supreme Court appointment, took the oath of office Friday from her father-in-law, Senior U.S. District Judge Paul Huck.

During the ceremony, Lagoa said her parents came to the United States from Cuba “without anything but their education, their strong work ethic and their desire to succeed, and these are values that they instilled in me.”

She also indicated that because of the experiences of people such as her parents, she has a “special appreciation” for the rule of law.

“Because we understand what it means when individual liberties, respect for private property and basic human rights are abandoned by a government. And this is why the oath I just took is not just words on a piece of paper to me,” Lagoa said. “I am particularly mindful of my obligation under our constitutional system of separated powers. Unlike the country my parents fled, we are a nation of laws and not of men.”

DeSantis early this year also appointed justices Robert Luck and Carlos Muniz. A joint investiture ceremony for them is scheduled Sept. 24.

83,Patient dies at Miami-area cosmetic surgery clinic,"MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - A patient at a southwest Miami-Dade County cosmetic surgery clinic died Friday after being transported to the hospital.

Miami-Dade police were called to MIA Aesthetics at 9300 SW 72nd St. after receiving a call around 11 a.m. of a patient in distress.

After police attempted to resuscitate the patient, the woman was taken to West Kendall Baptist Hospital, where she later died.

Just last week, the Florida Legislature voted to approve a new law that would increase regulations on cosmetic surgery clinics after several patients deaths in South Florida.

The Department of Health said whenever a patient dies or is transported, a licensed physician is required to report the incident to the department withing 15 days. From there, the agency can open an investigation and take further action.

People come to the reserve for a multitude of reasons, including the creek and trails.

On Thursday morning, Kayleen Hernandez Garay set out to enjoy one of the preserve's trails, embarking on a hike that was supposed to be 1 1/2 miles long.

A sheriff's helicopter eventually spotted Hernandez Garay in the vast woods.

The pilot landed at a former I-95 rest stop, walked to the hiker and escorted her out, then flew her back to her car.

""I've never had to call 911, and they were all amazing and they were just very nice about helpful,"" Hernandez Garay said.

Now, she said she wants something done with the trail markers, which she believes are inadequate.

(WFLA/WNBC) – A passenger on board a Delta Airlines flight tried to open doors on the plane on Friday, forcing the pilot to declare an emergency.

Official said an emotionally disturbed woman on board Delta flight 5953 from Raleigh, North Carolina to New York’s LaGuardia tried opening the forward service door mid-flight.

The pilot declared an emergency and continued on, landing safely at LaGuardia.

According to some passengers on the plane, the woman was screaming her head off, saying she needed to open the door and die. Her father had to pull her back to her seat.

Delta Airlines has not released a statement about the incident.

BALDWIN, Fla. - Two people were taken into custody Friday afternoon after a pursuit of stolen car in Northeast Florida, authorities said.

It started about 1:30 p.m. in Baker County and ended in Baldwin.

According to the Baker County Sheriff's Office, deputies were alerted to a vehicle in which the man driving assaulted a woman who was a passenger. Deputies said a witness reported the tag number of the vehicle and they learned the vehicle had been stolen from Jacksonville.

Deputies said they tried to stop the stolen vehicle, but it took off east on Interstate 10 toward Jacksonville.

During the pursuit, according to deputies, the vehicle, which appears to be a Mercedes, crashed in Baldwin and one person was taken into custody while another ran off.

The other person was eventually taken into custody with the help of a Jacksonville Sheriff's Office K-9 unit, deputies said.

The Florida Highway Patrol and CSX police were also involved in the pursuit of that person.

Prosecutors said late last month in a court filing that the case against 69-year-old Hester Burkhalter wasn't suitable for prosecution.

Court record show she pleaded not guilty.

The Tennessee woman was arrested last month on a charge of possession of hashish after a security guard found the oil and notified a sheriff's deputy as she tried to enter the Magic Kingdom at Disney World.

Burkhalter says she had a doctor's note saying it was prescribed for her arthritis.

CBD oil is extracted from the flowers of marijuana plants, but it doesn't produce a high.

97,Florida woman arrested after hundreds of bugs crawl out of child’s backpack,"ORLANDO — A Florida woman was arrested after a second-grader in her care repeatedly showed up to school in clothes caked in filth and a backpack filled with “hundreds” of bugs, deputies in the Panhandle said.

The girl is one of five siblings ages 5 to 14 who lived in a “filthy” Milton home infested with roaches, soiled mattresses on the floor, piles of cat feces, no edible food, broken windows and bags of trash throughout the home and yard, according to a Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office report.

Jessica Nicole Stevenson, 33, was arrested Friday and charged with five felony counts of child neglect without great bodily harm.

Deputies said Stevenson’s bedroom was “abnormally” clean compared with the condition of the rest of the home, with a flat-screen TV and bed linens. In contrast to the children’s closets, hers was filled with clean clothes, according to the report.

The children’s living conditions came to the attention of staff at Bagdad Elementary school, which three of the siblings attend, the probable cause affidavit said.

The second-grader told authorities she didn’t know when her last bath or shower had been. School staffers said they had repeatedly given the girl clean clothing to wear but that the child kept showing up dressed in the same outfits several days in a row as they became dirtier and dirtier.

A Florida Department of Children and Families report about the three siblings who attended the elementary school led to the sheriff’s office launching an investigation April 18, the Pensacola News Journal reported.

The newspaper reported that Stevenson made bond the day after her arrest and was released Saturday, the day after her arrest.

98,19-year-old Melbourne Beach woman arrested in deadly DUI crash,"CLOSE Here are tips on what to do if you are involved in a traffic crash, according to Master Sgt. Frank Sabol, Port St. Lucie police spokesman. WILL GREENLEE/TCPALM Wochit

A 19-year-old Melbourne Beach woman was charged this week in connection with a December wrong-way traffic crash that left one person dead and three others injured, court records show.

Kyah Evelyn Muntz was charged with DUI causing death to a human, DUI causing bodily injury to another and DUI damage to property after arranging to turn herself in to authorities after leaving a treatment facility. An active warrant was issued for the former Sebastian High student’s arrest on April 16. Muntz, however, had already checked into the unidentified facility to seek help, deputies reported.

The arrest stems from a Dec. 14 crash near Sabal Ridge Lane in Melbourne Beach.

According to FHP reports, it was 3 a.m. when Muntz was driving a two-door Volkswagen Beetle south in northbound lanes on SR A1A. Troopers reported that for an unknown reason, Muntz veered and struck a car carrying three people. Both vehicles then spun in the roadway.

Authorities said 21-year-old Katlyn Duncan, the driver, and 28-year-old Grant Luker of Orlando, the passenger, were seriously injured in the ensuing head-on collision. Kavika Chugh, 23, a second passenger, was killed. Muntz suffered head and leg injuries.

Muntz, when reached by FLORIDA TODAY, would not speak about the case. She pled not guilty to the charges in a court appearance on Wednesday.

101,Rattlers softball still reigns as the preeminent program within FAMU Athletics,"CLOSE WATCH: Rattler softball players work on their swing during batting practice. Rory Sharrock, Tallahassee Democrat

FAMU Athletics is no stranger to negativity and chaos.

However, the model of excellence on an annual basis takes place on the softball diamond.

Under the leadership of FAMU Sports Hall of Famer Veronica Wiggins, the softball team has shined as the preeminent program within the department.

Since her first season in 1992, the Rattlers have collected a league-best 14 MEAC championship trophies.

Upon the dawn of each season, FAMU is a perennial favorite to win the title. When it comes to individual awards, Rattler names habitually flood the list of preseason and postseason All-MEAC players.

Kyaira Brown, Tyra Bowers and Kimiya Watkins were chosen on the 2019 All-Tournament team.

This spring, the squad advanced to their sixth consecutive MEAC softball championship game.

FAMU's quest for collecting its 15th conference title ended with a crushing 11-5 loss versus Bethune-Cookman.

In the championship opener, Brown handcuffed the Wildcats with a complete game one-hitter. FAMU edged out B-CU, 1-0.

Unfortunately, the steady play didn't carry over to the finale.

The Rattlers were the victim of an uncharacteristic four errors in the winner-take-all game against their arch-rival.

B-CU posted six runs in the third and four in the fifth inning to secure the runaway victory.

Finishing as the runner-up would be a noteworthy accomplishment for most programs.

FAMU softball isn't most programs.

Winning championships is the benchmark and status quo for the Rattlers. Every player who sports the uniform embodies this culture on and off the field.

""FAMU softball is a lifestyle. We live it, breathe it, sleep it,"" Rattlers assistant softball coach Constance Orr said.

""Coach (Veronica) Wiggins has put her heart and soul into this program and it shows. I love being around this group of girls. They're phenomenal. When I'd drive by the field, there would be one or two girls on the field getting extra cuts. They've bought into what we're trying to instill in them.""

Although collecting trophies is the standard, missing the mark doesn't equate to total failure.

The overriding theme of sisterhood, scholarly feats and personal development carry the same weight as properly executing a 6-4-3 double play.

""Being a Rattler was a life-changing moment for me,"" said FAMU first baseman Taylor Rosier, who graduated on May 4. ""It's more than just a game. Coach Wiggins makes it about life. I wouldn't be the woman I am today if it wasn't for this team.""

CLOSE WATCH: Rattlers Alexis Day, Shakayla Nixon, Tyra Bowers and Taylor Rosier reflect on their softball careers at FAMU. Rory Sharrock, Tallahassee Democrat

FAMU went 26-27 (22-25 regular season) with a 13-2 conference record.

This run included a 12-0 stretch in MEAC play before dropping two of three at B-CU April 27-28.

They barreled over the competition to the tune of 7.1 runs per game versus MEAC schools. The Rattlers cracked double figures six times. Their contests were typically one-sided affairs with an average margin of a six-run differential in conference play.

This potency at the plate was courtesy of effective senior leadership. The guiding light on the field illuminated from Rosier, Bowers, Shakayla Nixon and Alexis Day.

""It means everything to me to be on this team. I didn't go out the way I wanted with a championship. I've given my everything to FAMU. Overall, I'm satisfied with my career at FAMU,"" Day said.

FAMU maintained a stronghold over the MEAC with the exception of going up against B-CU. Including the postseason, the Rattlers went 2-4 against the Wildcats in 2019.

Despite the outcome in Ormond Beach, there's still a high level of optimism for the program.

There are several key athletes returning for 2020. This solid group is talented and understands the expectation of being a FAMU softball player.

""We gave a good fight today (Saturday),"" Wiggins said.

""I told them before the game to give it all they had, to leave it all on the field and have fun. This team really grew up this year. With us being mostly freshmen and sophomores, we have a lot to look forward to next year. We won't linger on the disappointment of the game. We are looking forward to the future.""

The Rattlers add to the credibility of Tallahassee's moniker of being the college softball capital of the world.

FAMU (14) and Florida State (17) have a 31 conference titles.

Over the years, a tight-knit bond has been forged between Wiggins and FSU softball head coach, Lonni Alameda. Their mutual admiration and respect extends beyond the field of play.

Wiggins was one of many people well-wishers who reached out to Alameda following last year's World Series victory.

""She called and left me a voicemail. It's like family and you made them proud,"" Alameda said.

""Coach and I see each other at Publix all the time. Sometimes it's in the parking lot. Sometimes it's in the checkout line. She's so personable. She just gives you a big hug. It's almost like having a big sister here. She calls whenever she needs something. I'll call whenever I need something. Whether it's a ruling on a call, rainouts or equipment, we'll help each other.""",http://rssfeeds.tallahassee.com/~/601886994/0/tallahassee/home~Rattlers-softball-still-reigns-as-the-preeminent-program-within-FAMU-Athletics/,2019-05-12T09:53:15Z,Tallahassee Democrat,"277 N Magnolia Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA",FL,32301

A Tampa mom received a one-of-a-kind Mother's Day gift today thanks to a Tampa tire chain.

In honor of Mother's Day, the Tampa-based tire chain RNR Tire Express put out a call for extraordinary and selfless mothers to receive the surprise of a lifetime a free 2019 Buick Encore fitted with a brand new set of Yokohama Tires!

Selected from thousands of entries across the region, Jennifer Wheeler was nominated for her selflessness and kind heart. As a selfless woman and non-profit worker, Jennifer is always giving.

From giving food to the elderly in the community, to giving her daughter her last $15 to feed her family when she knew it meant not being able to afford gas to get to work the next day, to offering her savings to her family during a hard time after getting a second job to save for a car –which put her back at square one.

Two South Carolina inmates are charged in a sextortion blackmail scheme that led to the death of a 24-year-old Army veteran, authorities announced Friday.Greenville Police Chief Ken Miller said a months-long investigation led to blackmail charges against Lee Correctional inmates John William Dobbins Jr., 59, of North Charleston, and Carl Richard Smith Jr., 43, of Simpsonville.Miller said Dobbins and Smith used a contraband cellphone to operate a dating app scam in which they pretended to be a young woman and eventually exchanged nude pictures. They then pretended to be the parents of the young woman, who they claimed was underage, and threatened criminal charges and demanded money, Miller said. The victims, even innocent, would often pay, the chief said.An investigation called Operation Surprise Party uncovered a sextortion ring in the Carolinas in which inmates used contraband cellphones to target 442 service members from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. Authorities said the schemes cost service members more than $560,000.One victim of the scam was Jared Johns, Miller said. He served in the Army and was injured in Afghanistan. The father of two came home to battle post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.The scammers demanded nearly $1,200 from Johns. On Sept. 11, 2018, less than 24 hours after receiving the texts, Johns committed suicide. His twin brother found him.Johns left messages behind, including one on a dry erase board that said: “I’m sorry I’ve messed up. I love you all. This is not what I wanted. Tell my sons I was a good man.”“It was the thought of being arrested,” Johns’ mother, Kathy Bowling. said. “They convinced him he did something wrong.”After some investigating and law enforcement confirmation, Johns' parents later learned at least one inmate from Lee Correctional Facility scammed their son, sending texts from prison.“They never should have been able to reach him,” Bowling said. “I’m angry and you can’t put into words how you feel as a parent.”Johns' father said he wanted people to know his son was a great man, soldier and father.“These prisoners were put in there to protect us from them doing any more crime,” Kevin Johns said. “They are in there still doing crimes and people are still getting hurt.”The Johns pushed for legislation that would encourage state prisons to jam cellphone service.“These jammers are needed now more than ever, because I don’t want another family to have to go through what we went through,” Bowling said.Brian Sterling, with the South Carolina Department of Corrections, was at Friday’s news conference with Miller. He said he wants to see inmates cellphone signals banned. He said the solution is simple: jam signals and use geo-fencing.He said without taking those actions, prisons are “virtually out here, among us.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/tell-my-sons-i-was-a-good-man-sextortion-scam-led-to-young-army-vets-death-police-say/27440777,2019-05-11T09:34:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

110,Trayvon Martin attorney represents grandma arrested at Disney with CBD oil,"- An attorney who gained notoriety during the Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman trial will represent a great grandmother, recently arrested at Walt Disney World for having CBD oil.

On Friday, attorney Ben Crump announced in a press release that he will represent Hestor Burkhalter, the 69 year-old woman. Clearwater civil rights attorney Michele Rayner will join him as co-council.

The News Station first broke Burkhalter’s story after, while on a family vacation, she was detained by an Orange County sheriff’s deputy at the gates of Disney World. She told FOX 35 that security detained her after finding a bottle of CBD oil in her bag that she says she uses for her arthritis.

CBD oil is currently illegal in Florida but falls into a grey area that is often not enforced. It is also currently being regulated federally under the U.S. Farm Bill and may also be in the Sunshine State if the governor signs a hemp bill passed by the legislature this month.

In their statement Friday, Crump and Rayner said:

“This was a dream vacation for Ms. Burkhalter and her family to what is supposed to be the happiest place on earth — Walt Disney World. While Ms. Burkhalter’s charges have since been dropped, her family’s dream vacation will always be remembered as a nightmare complete with eight hours detained in jail after this false arrest. We expect better from Walt Disney World and demand a public apology while we pursue all avenues for justice for her.”

111,JACKSONVILLE MAN HIT BY VAN: Friend witnesses incident after traffic stop,"0 Woman sees friend hit by car as he ran from police

NEPTUNE BEACH, Fla. - A Jacksonville man is being treated for critical injuries after he was hit by a van in Neptune Beach, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. His friend says she witnessed him get hit.

This incident began after Genevieve Myatt was stopped by Neptune Beach Police for speeding Thursday evening. She was pulled over on the side of Atlantic Boulevard and Florida Boulevard.

Myatt said her friend, 50-year-old Thomas Bennett, got out of her car and became upset with the officer. She told Action News Jax exclusively that watched the confrontation transpire from the driver’s seat.

“When the police officer asked him to get down, he just didn’t comply,” Myatt said. “He wasn’t listening to what they were asking him to do.”

Police said Bennett became aggressive toward the officer and ripped his own shirt off. An officer shocked him with a stun gun, but they said it did not have much effect on Bennett.

The officer then pulled out his baton but didn’t use it because Bennett darted across Atlantic Boulevard. Myatt then watched her friend get hit by an oncoming minivan.

“Once I saw that he got hit, I immediately froze. I was terrified, I was upset,” Myatt said.

FHP began investigating the crash. They said Bennett suffered critical injuries and was taken to Memorial Hospital.

Action News Jax talked to the hospital Friday morning and learned that he was still being treated in the trauma center.

“I’m praying my friend is okay,” Myatt said. “I’m hoping he’s okay.”

Action News Jax asked Myatt why she believes Bennett became upset with police. She said her friend is “protective” over her and has been “going through a lot.”

Action News Jax reached out to police to learn if Bennett could face charges, and if the officer followed protocol during this traffic stop.

112,"1 arrested, 3 sought in Vero Beach on 'breach of peace' charge alleging sex in public area off 14th Avenue","Vero Beach Police Department (Photo: LAMAUR STANCIL/TCPALM)

VERO BEACH — One woman has been arrested and three other people have warrants out for their arrest, all accused of having sex in public view downtown one afternoon on 14th Avenue.

Police said they got two calls about two couples, about 10 feet apart, engaging in sexual intercourse in a grassy area of a parking lot in the 1900 block of 14th Avenue in full view of passersby and across the street from a restaurant at about 3:20 p.m. April 28.

Myra Olin, 56, who is homeless in Vero Beach, was arrested Thursday night on a charge of disorderly breach of peace.

Francis Rhinehart, 57; Peter Jankowski Jr., 47; and Lisa Goldenberg, 52, all homeless in Vero Beach, according to police, have open warrants for their arrest on the same charge. As of Friday afternoon, they had not been arrested.

A woman who called police said she was driving by the area when she saw the two couples and was shocked. The woman called police and sent pictures to them.

When officers arrived, they said they saw each couple together.

Jankowski Jr. and Olin told the officers ""we were just messing around.""

Officers said Rhinehart and Goldenberg told them they got ""caught up in the moment.""

Vero Beach police Lt. John Pedersen said the incident is ""unique"" for downtown Vero Beach in broad daylight.

""It's not a call that we typically get,"" he said. ""I mean we have had calls over the years of people on the beach or in a car or something where it was in a more private setting, but this was pretty appalling of these people to be engaged in this type of activity.""

Photos and a video of the two couples were circulated on a Vero Beach community Facebook page, prompting many comments from concerned residents. The images were taken down and reposted a few times before being removed for good.

Pedersen said from what he observed and understood from speaking to two witnesses, sexual organs were not plainly observed. He said one of the men's buttocks was clearly seen, but that isn't enough to charge someone with anything more than disorderly breach of peace.

""Do we normally have people having sex openly out in public, no, the answer to that is no,"" Pedersen said.

122,Man arrested for shooting girlfriend in back in Dade City,"DADE CITY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Hernando County man is facing several charges after deputies say he shot his girlfriend in the back and claimed it was an accident.

Hernando County deputies say a 911 hang-up call came in just after 6 a.m. Wednesday. When operators called the number back, 40-year-old Ronald Crisp answered.

Deputies say Crisp told 911 operators he was cleaning his gun when he accidentally shot his girlfriend. Operators say they heard a woman scream in the background and the call disconnected. Operators attempted to get back in touch with Crisp several times. When he finally answered, operators say a woman was heard screaming in the background asking for the phone. The call was then disconnected again.

Hernando County deputies who responded to the home on Reynolds Street in Dade City say they found a woman bleeding from her lower back. The woman was treated at the scene and was then taken to a local trauma center for advanced care.

When detectives spoke with Crisp at the scene, they say the man claimed he was ""clearing"" his gun when it accidentally went off, sending a round through the wall into the living room area. Crisp told them he then heard the woman screaming that she had been shot.

Once the victim was out of surgery, she spoke with detectives and told them the shooting was not accidental. Deputies say the woman told them she and Crisp had been arguing for a few days. According to a report from the sheriff's office, the woman said Crisp had a pocketknife in his hands during the argument.

The woman claims, at some point, Crisp got a handgun. She told deputies she exchanged words with Crisp and walked out of the bedroom, closing the door behind her.

Detectives say the woman told them she ""immediately heard a shot, then felt pain in her lower back."" When she screamed for Crisp to call 911, the victim told deputies he hesitated and then told her to go get his gun cleaning kit.

During a search of the home, detectives say they found a .380 caliber handgun with an altered serial number, a hidden short-barreled rifle with no identifiable serial number and a pocketknife. Deputies noted there was no hole in the wall where Crisp claimed there would be. A bullet hole was found in the bedroom door, deputies say.

125,Auburndale couple on quest to adopt 'Baby Parker',"Christine Parker: “We're blessed with a lot of nieces and nephews, but it's in the back of your head, like, 'Am I ever going to be a mom?' ”

AUBURNDALE — For about a decade, Mother's Day has left Christine Parker feeling a bit empty.

The Auburndale resident is happy to honor her mother and the mother of her husband, Chris. As she gathers with relatives, she also pays tribute to in-laws and basks in the affection of their many children.

Yet Parker, 32, remains unfulfilled in her long-held desire to be a mother.

“It's really hard to see, 'Hey, here's your Mother's Day rose,' and I'm just sitting there like —” Parker said, making a pouty face. “We're blessed with a lot of nieces and nephews, but it's in the back of your head, like, 'Am I ever going to be a mom?' ”

The Parkers have known since before they married nearly a decade ago that they would be unable to have children of their own. After waiting to attain stability in their careers and finances, late last year they began exploring the idea of adoption, seeking an infant under 1 year old.

The couple is now dealing with the reality that becoming parents means raising a considerable sum of money. By using a private adoption agency, they say the process could cost $40,000 or more.

The Parkers created a Facebook page with the name Operation Find Baby Parker, and they have held yard sales and other efforts to generate money. But it's not clear if they will gather the needed funds in time to have a baby in their nursery for Mother's Day of 2020.

“We talked about it, and we knew it wasn't going to happen overnight,” Christine Parker said. “We thought probably the time frame — we were hoping in probably a year.”

Her husband added: “It'll probably take two.”

The couple said they have raised about $5,000 so far.

Delaying parenthood

Chris Parker, 36, said a doctor told him at around age 14 that he would be unable to father children. That was a result of heavy doses of medication, including steroids, that he received as a child to treat asthma and other health problems.

The couple, both Polk County natives, began dating about 15 years ago. Christine Parker said her husband informed her long before they were married that biological children would not be an option.

The Parkers delayed pursuing adoption as Christine completed her college degree and got established in her job as a teacher, now at Caldwell Elementary School. After that, the couple wanted to wait until they bought a house, a pursuit they completed last year.

Christine Parker said she has always had an affinity for children and decided as a girl that she wanted to become a teacher. She started babysitting as a teenager and worked in a daycare center throughout high school.

Parker said she and her husband both have a weakness for children, as evidenced by what they recognize is excessive bestowing of gifts upon Christine's godson.

“I just want to be able to have the love I see other mothers have when they hold their child or they go to their games,” she said. “I want to be able to experience that. I want to have those family moments and family vacations.”

Chris Parker, who works in a Publix food-production facility, said he has long wanted to be a father.

“I think it's pretty important to me because I've seen the love that my father and mother have given me, and I want to be able to do the same thing,” he said, “kind of teach them what I've been taught. Sort of like to live on the Parker legacy, I guess.”

Christine Parker has a brother with three children, and Chris has 15 nieces and nephews. The couple said they didn't discuss their inability to conceive children, even to most of their relatives, before going public last year.

One person who did know is Juliana Walker, Christine's best friend since they were students at Florida Southern College. Walker, also a teacher, said she was unable to get pregnant for the first years of her marriage even after undergoing fertility treatment and had all but given up on having children when she finally became pregnant in 2017.

“That was something we bonded over,” Walker said of their mutually childless years. “You want to celebrate your mom (on Mother's Day), but the feeling of, 'Well, that's not me and I don't get to celebrate that,' that's a hard thing to face. I remember many Mother's Days we would call each other and just talk about it.”

Christine Parker is godmother to Walker's 15-month-old son, Xander.

“Through having my son, we've continued to bond and she has seen what it's like to be able to be a mom and the joy that comes with it,” Walker said. “We talked about how great it would be if she did adopt and we could raise our kids together.”

Money shock

The Parkers began exploring private adoption agencies last year, and they said they were stunned to discover how much the process can cost.

Many factors combine to determine how much an agency charges adoptive parents, said Nicole Witt, executive director of the Adoption Consultancy in Brandon. She said those seeking to adopt must cover the prenatal costs for the pregnant woman, including medical care, legal costs, counseling and even travel costs and living expenses.

Adoption agencies also charge for home inspections, Witt said, and their fees cover overhead costs, including advertising and outreach. She said the typical cost of adopting through a private agency ranges from the low $30,000s to the high $40,000s.

“It's generally speaking not a process for people without money,” said Adam Pertman, president of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency. “The demographic of people who adopt an infant is high socio-economic status because it is expensive. Even if people are fundraising, they still have to get to that amount of money.”

Seeking to adopt a baby also involves financial risk. A pregnant woman who contracts with an adoption agency to make her baby available has the legal right to change her mind, even after giving birth. In Florida, the woman may sign a consent form to relinquish her parental rights either 48 hours after birth or after she is discharged from the hospital, but she faces no deadline for doing so.

If the woman decides to keep the baby, the prospective parents usually forfeit most of the money they have paid, Witt said. Some agencies will roll over some of their fees, she said, but payments devoted to the woman's pregnancy care can't be recovered.

“Every time we interviewed with adoption agencies, that was our first question,” Christine Parker said. “They would avoid answering it.”

Couples wishing to adopt have other options besides going through private agencies. Children in state custody are available for adoption through such nonprofits as Heartland for Children, which contracts with the Department of Children and Families in Polk, Hardee and Highlands counties.

Adopting a foster child costs “little or nothing,” DCF says in an overview on its website. The agency doesn't charge for home studies and parent training classes, and it reimburses court costs and legal fees for adoptive parents in financial need.

Launching operation

The Parkers said they considered adopting an older child in foster care but feel a strong desire to adopt a baby.

Only about 14,000 infants are voluntarily offered for adoption in the United States each year, Pertman said. Many more children in state protection or foster care are available to prospective parents. But Pertman said it's unfair to criticize parents like the Parkers for preferring to seek an infant.

He said couples who choose to have biological children could also be asked why they don't instead adopt an older foster child when so many often spent years waiting to join a permanent family.

Knowing it would take them years to save enough money to cover the adoption costs, the Parkers decided to seek help. In December, they created their Facebook page, which includes an 850-word statement that says, “We are on a journey to complete our story with our missing piece … a baby!”

The page, which has attracted more than 200 followers, includes a link that allows donations to be made through PayPal. The couple also had business cards printed with the phrase “Please help bring home Baby Parker,” along with the Facebook page address and an email address.

The Parkers chose to include a biblical verse from the book of 1 Samuel: “For this child I have prayed and the Lord has granted the desires of my heart.”

After consulting with friends and relatives, the Parkers began planning other ways of raising money toward their adoption costs.

In addition to those direct contributions, the couple has received many donations of items for the two yard sales they have held so far. As word has spread — particularly through the school system — the Parkers said people they didn't know have come forward to give them furniture, a TV, clothes, purses and toys, among other items.

Chris Parker said he rented a truck so that he and his father could drive around the county collecting all of the gifts, some of which they are keeping in two storage units. Other donated items, including a crib, a bassinet and a swing, have been installed in the couple's nursery.

The nursery is painted in neutral turquoise and gray, and the Parkers say they have no gender preference.

Unexpected support

Christine Parker has expressed her gratitude on the Facebook page for the donations.

“The support we've been getting since we made it public, we weren't even expecting that,” she said. “You have that thought, 'Nobody's going to donate,' but the outpouring of love and support we've got from not only the community but complete strangers, we are so grateful.”

As another fundraiser, the Parkers are selling pieces to a jigsaw puzzle (a symbol of their sense that a piece is missing from their lives). Buyers will write their names on the back of each piece, and the puzzle.

Witt said she has worked with many couples who needed to generate the money to cover adoption costs. She has seen prospective parents take out home-equity loans, cash-in retirement savings and receive early inheritance gifts from parents.

Witt said many couples engage in fundraising efforts similar to what the Parkers are doing — organizing yard sales, car washes, wine tastings, spaghetti dinners, run-walk events and auctions. She said others take on second jobs or rent out rooms in their homes.

Grants and other financial assistance are available from private foundations to cover at least part of the cost of adopting. The Parkers said they plan to investigate those possibilities.

When a couple seeks to adopt an infant, the dynamic is completely different than if they were choosing a foster child. It is the pregnant woman who decides which applicants to the agency she wants to receive the baby.

The Parkers recently had someone from the adoption agency conduct a home inspection, a procedure they said lasted more than four hours. Their next step will be to prepare a video that the agency will share with women planning to give their babies up for adoption.

It is a challenge for the Parkers to remain patient as they strive to gather the money they need to pay for an adoption. Walker said Christine Parker has drawn encouragement from the public response.

“I think because there's been such an overwhelming response, she can see how much people love her,” Walker said. “She just thought there wouldn't be much of a response because this is a personal issue and a lot of people always want to ask, 'Well, why don't you do this?' and 'Why don't you do that?' I try to just encourage her and show her you can clearly see this is God's plan for you because it's worked out perfectly.”

One of the items the Parkers have received is not intended for Baby Parker or for sale to generate money. It's a book, “I Wished for You: A Keepsake Adoption Journal.”

Christine Parker said she received the journal from a friend of a friend at one of the couple's yard sales. The woman arrived with her adopted son.

Parker said she will probably make the same gesture after she finds Baby Parker.

""I'll probably pass it along so people know they're not alone, there are other people who went through the process, and pretty much not to give up,"" she said.

126,"Not-so-fantastic 4 of Florida men wore makeup, wigs for jewelry store robberies","MIAMI — Four felons from Broward County have been convicted in federal court of jewelry store robberies from South Florida to Georgia that sound like scenes out of a Tyler Perry movie.

Christopher Brinson, Adrian Hardy, Emmory Moore and Jerome Simmons chose attire for each robbery’s gunmen that was less “Going in Style” than “Madea Goes to Jail.” They didn’t wear dresses, but did don wigs, slapped on makeup and wore women’s clothes, such as pink jumpsuits.

Alas, the four veterans of the Florida Department of Corrections proved no more skilled than they were stylish.

When they left one robbery, Moore left behind his cellphone, which was not only connected to a phone number on his account, but had the jewelry store’s name and number listed among the contacts. Brinson’s phone contained a photo of three of them next to a silver minivan rented and used in one of the robberies — a silver minivan with a SunPass that made the vehicle easily trackable.

While skedaddling from the last heist, they dropped a bag with over $1 million of jewelry.

The Justice Department used the Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative, which led to an armed robber getting 92 years and a man getting 32 years for over 20 armed robberies, to make federal cases out of the interstate run of robberies.

According to the criminal complaints, on March 3, 2017, Brinson walked into Class Jewelers located at 3756 W. Hillsboro Blvd. in Deerfield Beach and asked about selling a ring. Not long after Brinson’s visit, at around 2 p.m., surveillance cameras spotted two men dressed as women with long, dark wigs come in and rob the store at gunpoint. Employees didn’t identify the robbers dressed as women, but did easily identify advance scout Brinson.

The same thing happened March 16, 2017, at Lilli’s Jewelry Store in Spring Hill, an area north of Tampa. But as the two men-dressed-as-women left with $10,000 of jewelry and hopped in a silver minivan, Moore left behind his cell phone.

That whoopsy allowed cops to see text messages to and from Moore discussing “licks,” current slang for money quickly acquired by robbery; an internet history that included searches for Lilli’s and “jewelry store robbery in Hillsboro” (criminals tend to like to see what the media has to say about their crimes).

On April 1, two men and a woman, “all three … wearing long, dark-colored wigs, long-sleeved dark-colored shirts and long, dark-colored pants” and “light makeup” hit Bishops Jewelers in Valdosta, Georgia. Before the robbery, a man called the store to ask if the male employee was there yet. He was told the male employee would be there in an hour. A similar call preceded the robbery at Lilli’s.

Moore was arrested on April 6, 2017, for being a felon in possession of a firearm while, an arrest report says, he drove around in an unregistered car with illegally dark tints on the windows while smoking marijuana.

Hardy, Simmons and Brinson showed up at LSO Jewelry and Repair in Port St. Lucie at 9:05 a.m. April 13, 2017, “wearing heavy facial makeup and women’s clothing.”

Hardy: “dark-colored pants, a dark, long-sleeved top with a bright multi-colored shirt underneath, sunglasses, and long, dark-haired wig.

Simmons: “a women’s pink jumpsuit with a dark-colored wig.”

Brinson: “green pants, a light blue, long-sleeved top and a dark-colored wig.”

Perhaps the most eye-catching part of their ensembles, at least to the LSO employees: “Each also wore black gloves and brandished a firearm.”

When an LSO employee identified as “L.O.” asked Simmons if she could help him, Simmons said in a masculine voice, “I’m looking for an engagement ring.”

Hardy and Brinson locked the front door, then Hardy and Simmons marched L.O. and co-worker “N.N.” to the backroom at gunpoint. While they lay on their stomachs with faces down, the three criminals took what they wanted from the safe and display cases. An outside man told them through a walkie-talkie they were “good on time.”

Simmons relieved L.O. of a silver diamond and ruby Rolex. Then, suddenly, the inside trio wasn’t good on time. An off-duty cop saw the three enter the store and seemingly lock the door behind them. That was enough to prompt a 911 call.

A front door departure was aborted upon sight of approaching police, so the threesome ran out the back, “dropping a large bag containing nearly a million dollars’ worth of jewelry. The only item of jewelry removed from the store was the Rolex watch.”

Simmons was arrested after crawling out of some bushes, wearing only “boxers, socks, makeup on his face, and carrying a walkie-talkie in his hand.”

Hardy ran toward Martin Health System Diagnostic Services emergency room and hopped into a nearby box truck. The truck’s owner approached Hardy to find out why a badly made up guy was treating his truck like a cab.

“The owner of the truck told law enforcement that Hardy immediately exited the truck and left behind a wig, gloves, and sunglasses,” the complaint said.

Police hadn’t found Hardy when a call came in around 12:06 p.m. from a man worried that his pal, J.K., hadn’t been home at the pickup time for their golf game. And, the friend said, J.K. didn’t miss pickup time for a golf game.

Law enforcement found nobody inside at J.K.’s home. A trip through the house found drops of blood on the floor, an unopened gallon of milk on the counter, cell phones and two women’s purses.

Cops were still there when J.K. returned with another chapter to the story.

J.K., from Toronto, Canada, said Hardy, still on the run from police, had two guns and forced J.K., J.K.’s wife, their son and their son’s girlfriend to drive him to Broward County. Hardy had them exit at Sunrise Boulevard and drop him off at Tony’s Market, 800 NW 22nd Rd.

Brinson eventually was arrested April 20 on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Hardy was taken into custody May 8, 2017 after a traffic stop in Orlando.

Each of the four went down on charges of Hobbs Act robbery (affecting interstate or foreign business), conspiracy to commit a Hobbs Act robbery and brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime. Hardy got an extra four counts of kidnapping.

They’re scheduled to be sentenced June 7.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190511/not-so-fantastic-4-of-florida-men-wore-makeup-wigs-for-jewelry-store-robberies?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T16:10:28Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

Cindy Yang, the woman whose selfie with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago launched her into worldwide notoriety, is reportedly under federal investigation.The FBI has opened a public corruption investigation into the Wellington resident, according to the Miami Herald.Yang's attorney, Evan Turk, said she told him Friday she has not been contacted by the FBI or any other investigators about her role in raising money for the GOP.That doesn't mean she is not under investigation, though, and according to Turk, Yang is devastated and suffering emotionally and physically. ""Now all of a sudden she is a prisoner in her own world because she can't escape this and for her, it's pure hell that she's going through,"" said Turk.Turk said Yang is staying with relatives in an undisclosed location.She has been in the spotlight since the Miami Herald first disclosed in March that Yang was the former owner of the Jupiter spa where police say New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft received sex acts.

She and other Yang associates contributed the maximum $5,400 last year to Trump's reelection campaign, the Herald reported, saying investigators are trying to determine if Yang paid the employee back for the contribution, which might be illegal if she didn't disclose it.Turk said he has no knowledge of the campaign contributions yet, but said his firm is prepared to vigorously defend Yang, whom he described as a business woman trying to ""do good"" by contributing to charity and political causes.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/lawyer-cindy-yangs-life-pure-hell-after-accusations-of-mar-a-lago-influence-peddling/27438787,2019-05-10T23:02:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
130,Romance playbook reveals social media pickup lines used in schemes are scripted,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Pages of pickup lines from what is purported to be a Nigerian “romance playbook” offers insight into

the scripted conversation young Nigerian men use to fool unsuspecting women on social media dating sites.

Diane Standish, a Central Florida widow, lost $270,000 to a man who used the photo of a foreign ambassador in a lie of love crafted with many of the same lines found in the playbook.

Standish, who filed for bankruptcy a few months ago, gave her alleged love interest her life savings. Today, she rents a room from a relative in Orlando.

The man, who claimed to be a contractor, asked her for various amounts of cash to help pay for a bogus construction project.

“Four months into it and he asked me to marry him,” she said. “ It makes me sick to my stomach.”

News 6 showed her the playbook that includes lines ranging from “Hi how was your weekend,"" to “Do you like to re-marry again?""

“I think every woman should see this, I would highly recommend it,” Standish said.

News 6 obtained the playbook from California-based Social Catfish, a high-energy group of cyberdetectives who track down the true identities of women and men claiming to want relationships on the online dating circuit.

Social Catfish CEO David McClellan said a 62-year-old woman’s poor health inspired an alleged Nigerian Romeo who goes by the name of Luke, to send the playbook to them via text.

“They’re screwing with your head,"" McClellan said. “They're pushing you to whatever it takes to give them money.”

In a Facetime interview with Social Catfish, Luke explained how he throws out a net in hopes of getting responses.

“We just send 1,000 messages, you get 100 replies,” he said.

In an email to News 6, Luke, who said his real name is Ogbama Godfrey, said he wanted to help expose the scammers but was afraid he would face arrest by U.S. authorities.

Godfrey wrote in part: “Know I’m going to be arrested after the interview, I might be used as bait for many successful scammers, it’s indeed a nice thing to see how much you want to investigate and know more about romance scam.”

According to the Federal Trade Commission, romance scams “rank number one” on total reported losses with a staggering $143 million last year.

The FTC reports the average loss per victim is about $2,600.

The catfish-style impostors use photographs lifted from legitimate social media sites such as Facebook.

Godfrey has used about a dozen different photos and admits stealing thousands of dollars from unsuspecting women.

The 22-year-old said the women are actually considered “clients” with a typical profile of: widow, divorced or depressed.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - A Florida woman was arrested last week after her daughter's school found ""hundreds of bugs"" in the girl's backpack, prompting the Florida Department of Children and Families to visit their home, the Pensacola News Journal reported.

Jessica Stevenson, 33, of Milton, was arrested on five counts of child neglect without causing great bodily harm.

The DCF conducted a wellness check at her home after Bagdad Elementary School staff member made a report concerning three siblings who attended the elementary school, according to an affidavit.

The employee noted that her second-grade daughter had been wearing the same clothing for a week. When asked when her last bath had been, the student said she did not know, authorities said.

On one occasion, “hundreds of bugs crawled out” of the student’s “backpack in the lunchroom,” the report stated.

A teacher said the school had repeatedly given the girl clean clothing, but each new outfit would be worn continuously until it was worn out and another outfit would be provided by the school.

The teacher also noted that the girl was frequently crying, “having meltdowns” and seemed depressed, the report stated.

The girl has four other siblings between the ages of 5 and 14, two of which attend Bagdad Elementary School.

When deputies visited Stevenson's home, they discovered an infestation of roaches, broken windows and bags of trash throughout the home and yard.

“The roaches were on nearly every surface in the home” including “on the children’s mattress, in the pots and pans in the kitchen, and inside the cabinets/fridge,"" the report stated.

There was no edible food inside of the home. The cabinets were empty of food and the refrigerator had two cartons of spoiled milk, spoiled eggs, sugar and a stick of butter.

Stevenson's bedroom, however, was ""abnormally"" clean with minimal roaches and a stashed bag of snacks, according to the report.

Stevenson was charged with five felony counts of child neglect without great bodily harm and booked into the Santa Rosa County Jail Friday. She was released Saturday on a $2,500 bond.

In an interview with Pensacola ABC affiliate WEAR, the mother disputed the report, claiming she had been targeted ""unfairly.""

""I'm not a bad mom, I do everything I can. I work hard,"" Stevenson told Pensacola ABC affiliate WEAR on Tuesday. ""They just made it harder for me.""

Stevenson said she was given a no-contact order for her children, which have been temporarily removed from her care.",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-mom-charged-after-hundreds-of-bugs-found-in-child-s-backpack/1994125202,2019-05-10T11:13:55Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

The employee noted that her second-grade daughter had been wearing the same clothing for a week. When asked when her last bath had been, the student said she did not know, authorities said.

On one occasion, “hundreds of bugs crawled out” of the student’s “backpack in the lunchroom,” the report stated.

A teacher said the school had repeatedly given the girl clean clothing, but each new outfit would be worn continuously until it was worn out and another outfit would be provided by the school.

The teacher noted that the girl was frequently crying, “having meltdowns” and seemed depressed, the report stated.

The girl has four other siblings between the ages of 5 and 14, two of which attend Bagdad Elementary School.

When deputies visited Stevenson's home, they discovered an infestation of roaches, broken windows and bags of trash throughout the home and yard.

“The roaches were on nearly every surface in the home” including “on the children’s mattress, in the pots and pans in the kitchen, and inside the cabinets/fridge,"" the report stated.

There was no edible food inside of the home. The cabinets were empty of food and the refrigerator had two cartons of spoiled milk, spoiled eggs, sugar and a stick of butter.

Stevenson's bedroom, however, was ""abnormally"" clean with minimal roaches and a stashed bag of snacks, according to the report.

Stevenson was charged with five felony counts of child neglect without great bodily harm and booked into the Santa Rosa County Jail Friday. She was released Saturday on a $2,500 bond.

In an interview with Pensacola ABC affiliate WEAR, the mother disputed the report, claiming she had been targeted ""unfairly.""

""I'm not a bad mom, I do everything I can. I work hard,"" Stevenson told Pensacola ABC affiliate WEAR on Tuesday. ""They just made it harder for me.""

Stevenson said she was given a no-contact order for her children, which have been temporarily removed from her care.",http://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-mom-charged-after-hundreds-of-bugs-found-in-child-s-backpack/1994125202,2019-05-10T10:22:53Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

146,Hawk harassing Daytona Beach woman flies coop,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - A 91-year-old Daytona Beach woman is happy to be a free woman at last after her unwanted feathered guest checked out for the last time.

June Miller shared her story in late April about the hawk who built its home on top of her second-story bay window and attacked Miller and her dog whenever she walked outside.

News 6 went back to visit Miller on Wednesday after she said the hawk living above her window is finally gone. News 6 helped Miller fill out paperwork and a permit request to remove the hawk and its nest.



""I could not walk out of my house without looking up to be sure that the hawk was not going to come and get you. They made that noise, that screeching, and you knew he was ready to dive,"" she said.



The resident said the bird nipped her head three times within the last several months leaving scars.

News 6 was not allowed inside the Pelican Bay Golf Community to get video of Miller's house but did receive pictures of the hawk nestled inside the large nest. Miller said she hadn't seen the hawk for two days and on Friday, she got a call from the local Florida Fish & Wildlife office after receiving the paperwork and asked for an update before moving forward.



""Michelle asked me to be sure there's nothing in (the nest) and it was empty,"" Miller said.



On Monday, Miller's friend brought over a tall ladder and removed the nest from the bay window. She said the nest was covered in Spanish moss and feathers and woven together with little sticks.



""It's nice being able to walk out without having to look up and protect yourself with hard hat, umbrella or whatever necessary,"" she said.



Miller said she'll receive the money back for the permit application fee since Mother Nature eventually took its course but is grateful for everyone who helped her along the way.



""I do appreciate them very much,"" she said.

150,Man extricated from pickup that overturned Saturday on I-75,"Marion County Fire Rescue officials extricated a Titusville man from a pickup that slammed into an Interstate 75 guardrail and then entered a highway where it overturned onto its roof early Saturday morning.

Brandon Ceon, the 33-year-old driver and sole occupant in an older model Chevy Silverado, was transported to Ocala Regional Medical Center where he’s expected to recover from his injuries, according to a Florida Highway Patrol trooper on scene. Ceon was wearing a seat belt, according to the trooper.

FHP officials were notified about the single-vehicle wreck shortly after 12:30 a.m.

The crash, located less than five miles from the County Road 484 exit, blocked the middle and left lanes on I-75 southbound for several hours.

It was the second single vehicle crash that shut down two lanes of I-75 within the last several days. On Monday night, the driver of a semi-truck hauling 41,000 pounds of bananas crashed into the guardrail and overturned onto its side roughly eight miles south of the County Road 318 interchange. The driver was not seriously injured, troopers said.

Officials said the Chevy was traveling southbound in the outside lane. A female witness told authorities she was in the center lane and the pickup drove by her. The woman said that while was passing her, the driver veered for an unknown reason oto the west grassy shoulder. He tried to return to the roadway and in doing so over-corrected, which caused the vehicle to cross all three lanes. The vehicle drove onto the shoulder where the passenger side struck the guardrail.

The vehicle then made its way back onto I-75 and flipped on its roof, pinning the driver inside. Rescue officials arrived and removed the man from the vehicle.

The witness told troopers it appeared the man was speeding.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190511/man-extricated-from-pickup-that-overturned-saturday-on-i-75?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T18:38:39Z,Ocala.com,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471
151,Drug enforcement team arrests trafficking suspect,"Taken into custody on Wednesday was Aleisha Diane Oliver, who was charged with two counts of conspiracy to sell marijuana and one count conspiracy to sell heroin. Drug officials said the woman was part of a once-high level drug trafficking group that operated in Marion County.

The local Unified Drug Enforcement Strike Team, or UDEST narcotics agents, arrested a woman who they say transported drugs for a once high-level drug trafficking organization that distributed illegal drugs throughout the Marion County area.

Taken into custody on Wednesday was Aleisha Diane Oliver, who was charged with two counts of conspiracy to sell marijuana and one count conspiracy to sell heroin. The Ocala woman was apprehended in the afternoon at her residence at 9570 SW 32nd Court.

Marion County Jail records show the 30-year-old was released at 2:10 a.m. Thursday on $30,000 bond. Oliver could not be reached for comment.

Drug officials said that in 2017 they received information that a drug trafficking group was operating within Marion County and in their investigation they received detailed information about its structure and its members. Agents said they came to suspect that Angel Marin, 30, was a drug dealer who regularly conspired with others to traffic drugs.

In the case of Oliver, authorities said that on March 16, Marin told Oliver to bring a pound of marijuana to someone in Ocala. Oliver delivered the drug to the individual, and four days later, Marin told Oliver to drop off another pound of marijuana to another person in Ocala, which she did, authorities said.

Then on April 6, Marin told Oliver to bring .5 grams of a substance, believed to be heroin, to a third person in Ocala. Marin allegedly told Oliver to go to a safe in his home, get the drugs, and weigh them.

Agents said when they executed a search warrant on April 24 at Marin's home, located in the 13100 block of Southwest 84th Terrace Road in Marion Oaks, they found 90 grams of heroin in the only safe found in the residence.

Marin’s brothers Angel Marin, 30, and Artime Marin, 26, all of Marion Oaks, were arrested on several drug charges by agents last month. Angel Marin is represented by William Ramputi, while Andys Marin is represented by James Tarquin. Court records show Artime Marin, who has Jeremy Powers as his attorney, was released on $25,000 bond.

Last month a judge ordered that before Andys Marin posted his bond of $410,000, the judged needed to know how Andys Marin planned on paying for his bail. The question came up at a bond hearing where it was revealed his detailing job pays him less than $100 per instance.



At the same hearing, Ramputi, the attorney for Angel Marin, asked the court for a continuance because he said he had just received the case. Ramputi told the Star-Banner he needed to be prepared to address the evidence that prosecutors may bring before the court. Angel Marin has no bond, according to Marion County Jail records.



UDEST agents described the Marins as the heads of a drug organization that's responsible for distributing heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana in Marion County. They believe the organization has brought in drugs with a street value of about $3.3 million into Marion County within the past few years.



Authorities began surveillance on the group in 2017 and conducted street level buys. They believe at least two of the brothers took several trips to California to purchase drugs in large quantities and returned to Marion County to sell them. Agents got word that at least one of the brothers was seen entering Mexico.



In April, Andys Marin went to California and bought marijuana, which was placed in suitcases and transported by various couriers to Orlando and then to Marion County, according to agents.



Agents seized two of the suitcases that they say contained marijuana.



On April 24, agents, after obtaining a search warrant, arrested the Marin brothers, along with about a half-dozen other people. Agents said more arrests are pending.



Assisting local agents with the case were the DEA, SWAT Team law enforcement officials from the Ocala Police Department, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office and Citrus County, as well as members of the North California High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area and the North Florida High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.

152,A happy Mother's Day wish to the strong women in our lives,"Rev. Candace McKibben (Photo: Candace McKibben)

It wasn’t an immediate recognition and I cannot remember just how it came to me. But somehow over the course of the three weeks since the death of my mother on April 15, I realized that I am now the matriarch of my family. It has set me to thinking about what it means to be a matriarch and what the matriarchs in my family have meant to me in my life.

By definition, a matriarch is a woman who rules a family, group or state, and often is a mother who is the head of her family. In my own larger family, it is the later definition that I find relevant.

On my father’s side of the family, I think of his oldest sister, Elizabeth, after whom I named my youngest daughter. Her life was far from easy. A husband who suffered from alcohol addiction, an adult son killed in a tragic car accident as he tried to dodge a dog on a desolate country road, and the challenge of trying to raise a family on her own without an education to empower her, might have understandably diminished her. Rather, it strengthened her resolve and resilience.

Raised poor on a farm in south Georgia, she remarkably ran a successful dress shop in the Riverside area of Jacksonville for years. She ended up caring not only for her own family but for her nieces and nephews who were numerous as she had nine siblings. It was my Aunt Elizabeth who rallied the larger family to make it possible for me to study in England the fall semester of my senior year at Furman University.

When I married, it was my Aunt Elizabeth who bought my wedding dress and who rallied the family to purchase beautiful Waterford crystal that I cherish to this day. No one was more enthusiastic about my successes or sympathetic toward my failures.

On my mother’s side of the family, her eldest sister, Jalie, was as generous and kind a person as I have ever met. Like my Aunt Elizabeth, she had lost a son, her only son, when he was a young adult leaving behind two young children. Her sorrow was deep, but she found a way to transform her sorrow into compassion for others.

She cared for her mother in her home for years before her death and then took on the role of holding the family together. She often hosted family gatherings in her home when she was well into her eighties. She was certain to remember important dates in the lives of her family members and mail cards of appreciation and encouragement.

She was very supportive of me in my ministry, sending donations to the churches I have been privileged to serve regularly. She was nurse to many of her siblings including her baby sister.

At age 89, she hired a driver to take her from her home near Meridian, Mississippi, to the hospice house in Saint Augustine, Florida, so that she could sit at the bedside of her dying sister until she passed. She was there for weeks, ushering her baby sister into heaven.

But the matriarch I am thinking of most as Mother's Day approaches is my own mother, after whom I named my first daughter. I see in many ways that she was a matriarch not by default of being the one left to take charge, but by her own strength of character and commitment to her values.

Family was a priority to my mother and for decades she invited her local family members into her home every Saturday evening for dinner and her husband’s family members into her home every Sunday after church. Both meals, weekend after weekend, were stellar with delicious food and warm fellowship. She made it a point to visit her family in Mississippi twice a year for a week at a time. In between, she was supporting them financially and always with her prayers.

She was an advocate for those in the family who were suffering and needed support. She was generous toward those in need. She was unwavering in her faith in God in times both good and bad. And even in her later years, when the dementia with which she bravely lived diminished her in so many ways, she was still the matriarch, the one who held our family together and caused us to commit to the highest good.

I know some do not like the label of matriarch. It is a reminder of being the oldest generation and of responsibilities we may prefer to ignore. As I think of the matriarchs in my own family, I am filled with gratitude for the strong women from whom I come and feel humbled to bear the title.

I hope you have a moment to reflect on the matriarchs who have influenced you and, whether they are still living or have moved on from this life, will send them a Happy Mother’s Day wish.

154,Kimberly Kessler asks about death penalty in jailhouse call,"NASSAU COUNTY, Fla. - Jailhouse phone calls that Kimberly Kessler, the woman charged with killing her co-worker Joleen Cummings, made after she was arrested last year were obtained Friday by News4Jax.

Kessler, 50, discusses complains jail conditions in a couple of the calls, but in the first one, she asks about the death penalty.

Kessler: “Florida and Texas, are those the only two states with the death penalty?”

Caller: “I don’t know, I haven’t done the research on that. You might want to YouTube that and get back to me on it.”

Kessler: “Yeah, I don’t think I’d want to know and then tell you bad news. I thought someone said they weren’t doing that anymore, and they shouldn’t do it anymore because the dumb***** get everything wrong.""

The release of the calls comes ahead of Mother's Day weekend, which marks one year since Cummings, a 34-year-old mother of three, disappeared.

Investigators suspect Kessler, who worked with Cummings at Tangles hair salon in Yulee, was the last person to see Cummings alive.

Following Cummings’ disappearance, her SUV was found parked outside a Home Depot. Kessler was arrested May 16, 2018, after investigators said they found footage showing her getting out of the vehicle and booked into the Nassau County jail, where she went on a hunger strike that prompted her to later be moved to the Duval County jail.

It's unclear at which jail the calls were made from, but she complains about the treatment in the jail in two of them.

“My attorney told me he has no control over them. They mistreat me. That’s just how it is, basically. He didn’t say it exactly in those words. That’s my interpretation of it. So I’m surprised they let me call you. Perhaps they were looking to listen to a fascinating conversation in between us. I don’t know why they let me call you, but they did. He said they should let me call him whenever I want, and they didn’t, they didn’t let me do it. They make excuses, like, ‘Oh we’re busy,’ then shut the door and walk away. It’s kind of funny they keep me in solitary confinement, like, it’s a bad thing,"" Kessler said with a laugh in one jailhouse call. ""It’s heaven, girl.”

In another call, Kessler, who went by Jennifer Sybert, talks about wanting out of jail. Authorities said she has used 17 aliases over the years.

Kessler: “Bail me out under my name that I’m going under, which is Jennifer Marie Sybert. And then eventually everything’s going to come together, but, with my real name Kim Kessler. But you know, go about it, jump through the hoops.”

Person on the other end of the call: “OK. You said bail you out under Jennifer?""

Kessler: “Yeah, because that’s how they arrested me under. Until the FBI corrects it, it’s gonna be Jennifer.”

Other person: “The FBI? Oh, my God, they won’t correct.“

Kessler: “They will. You just put the money up as Jennifer Marie Sybert. I gave you my Social, by date of birth the name, my name my alias or whatever that I’ve been living under for 19 years. You’re all set.”

Other person: “Oh, my God. Are you warm, sleeping alright? They gave you a blanket?”

Kessler: “Of course not. It’s terrible. I’m in jail. It’s very, very bad.""

Other person: “It would be nice if they treated you the way they would want to be treated.”

Kessler: “Well, if you really want to help come and get me out. So, that would be great.”

Kessler is now charged with first-degree murder in Cummings’ death. The day after she was indicted on Sept. 7, she discusses how unexpected the indictment was during a call.

“I didn’t expect it to come, but I was… I guess it was always in the back of my mind because I knew they were crazy like that, because they did it to me before. I don’t know. I guess I got too trusting, like, I thought their BS was over. Tom Townsend (her lawyer) told me today that I was on the front page of the newspaper, I’m all over the news. He said they had a bunch of people call the public defender’s office -- Newsline or Dateline called, a bunch of entities or whatever, like news channels, were calling today. I was (like), 'Really?’ He said, 'They were all calling. You’re all over the newspaper, all over the news.' And I was, like, 'Really?’” she can be heard saying in the call.

A year later, Cummings’s body has not been found, despite an extensive search at a Georgia landfill that turned up items of interest.

Since then, the state has released reams of evidence in the case through the discovery process that suggest a struggle occurred at the salon and that steps were taken to dispose of that evidence.

155,WEEKLY ROUNDUP: THE PRESIDENT COMES CALLING,"TALLAHASSEE — President Donald Trump pumped up Panhandle residents in person this week with a pledge to deliver big bucks for storm relief and a promise to rebuild an Air Force base that is an economic backbone for the region.

But that’s not all.

In one of the state’s reddest regions, the president pulled out his re-election playbook by chiding Democrats in Congress, mocking Democrats running for the White House and riffing on some of the usual Trump targets: China, Venezuela and Puerto Rico.

But it was a woman in the Panama City Beach crowd, and the president’s response to her, that sparked international headlines following Wednesday night’s rally.

The interaction came during a familiar Trump refrain in which the president griped about a continued influx of migrants seeking asylum at the southwestern border of the United States.

Trump pointed out that border agents aren’t allowed to use deadly force.

“Other countries do. We can’t. I would never do that. But how do you stop these people? You can’t,” Trump said.

“Shoot ‘em!” an unidentified woman said, prompting the president to point to the crowd and shake his head.

“That’s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement,” Trump said, eliciting a roar from an obviously tickled audience. “Only in the Panhandle.”

The latest immigration-related controversy came less than a week after the Republican-dominated Legislature passed one of the nation’s strictest laws against so-called sanctuary cities. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who joined Trump at the rally, made the sanctuary-city ban a cornerstone of his campaign last year.

The president also tweaked “Governor Ron” during his 90-minute remarks, recalling that DeSantis visited him at some unspecified time in the White House.

“Governor Ron, he’d say, ‘President please,’ in the Oval Office, ‘please we’re winning too much, we’re not used to this, Mr. President, we’re not used to this,’ ” Trump said.

“ ‘For years and years, we’ve been losers, we’ve been losing Mr. President,’ ” he went on, continuing to quote DeSantis. “ ‘Now we’re winning, the people of Florida can’t stand winning so much. Can you maybe pull it back a little bit Mr. President?’ ”

“And I said, ‘No I can’t Ron, I’m sorry,’ ” Trump said.

DeSantis’ spokeswoman, Helen Ferré, helped translate Trump’s remarks.

“The President was using good humor to say that Governor DeSantis is taking great care of Florida,” she said in an email.

‘THERE IS A LOT MORE COMING’

Trump vowed Tyndall Air Force Base will be rebuilt after sustaining massive damage in Hurricane Michael and said he will approve the state’s request to boost federal funding for storm recovery in Northwest Florida.

Trump, who last visited the region 45 days after the Category 5 storm made landfall in October, said the federal reimbursement levels for hurricane recovery in the region will be boosted from 75 percent to 90 percent “in many circumstances.”

“We will never, ever leave your side,” Trump said following chants of “USA” and “four more years” from a crowd at the Aaron Bessant Park Amphitheater. “We’ve already given you billions of dollars, and there is a lot more coming.”

He said $448 million has been approved by his administration for housing disaster recovery assistance.

Trump’s comments came as he and Senate Republicans are locked in a battle with Democrats over how much of a stalled federal disaster-relief package should go to Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017. Delays in the relief package have frustrated Panhandle officials and residents.

DeSantis requested increased federal assistance after the storm was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane last month.

Trump’s rally followed a tour of Tyndall, where he was joined by DeSantis, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, both Florida Republicans.

“I really believe Northwest Florida is going to come back stronger than ever before,” DeSantis told the crowd.

EMPOWERING TEACHERS?

In other business Wednesday, DeSantis signed legislation that expands the controversial school “guardian” program to allow armed classroom teachers.

DeSantis’ office announced the signing shortly after 6 p.m. without ceremony or comments about the bill, which was widely backed by House and Senate Republicans and heavily opposed by gun-control activists, Democrats and some students who survived last year’s mass shooting at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

The governor signed the bill (SB 7030) hours after he received it.

Earlier in the week, DeSantis praised the Legislature for implementing “dozens of school safety recommendations” made by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, noting the recommendations included expansion of the guardian program. The Legislature formed the commission last year to investigate the February 2018 shooting and recommend ways to make schools safer.

Other changes included in the wide-ranging bill will put $75 million into school mental-health services, strengthen reporting requirements for potentially threatening incidents that happen on school premises, improve information-sharing between school districts on students with behavioral issues and continue investment in a tool that assists with school emergencies.

Lawmakers praised most parts of the bill but were sharply divided on the expansion of the guardian program to allow districts to have armed teachers. When the guardian program was created last year, it was geared toward school staff members whose main duties were outside the classroom. The only classroom teachers who could volunteer to participate in the program had to double in other positions, such as serving as coaches, administrators or cafeteria employees.

The program is voluntary for school districts and employees. Currently, 30 of Florida’s 67 school districts have decided to allow trained and armed school staff members.

EMPOWERING PARENTS

A day after signing the school guardian expansion, DeSantis signed into law another controversial education measure that creates an additional school-vouchers program.

DeSantis, flanked by key lawmakers, appeared Thursday morning at Potter’s House Christian Academy in Jacksonville and at Mount Moriah Christian Fundamental Academy in St. Petersburg. Later, he went to William A. Kirlew Junior Academy in Miami Gardens, where he signed the bill.

Lawmakers last week gave final approval to the plan (SB 7070), which includes creating the Family Empowerment Scholarship Program to provide vouchers to as many as 18,000 students next year to attend private schools.

DeSantis pointed to what he called a “historic legislative session” on education issues, including creation of the vouchers program and other efforts to bolster school choice.

“Let’s empower parents. Let’s allow them to make the decisions, and I think that is going to mean more achievements in the future for all of our students,” DeSantis said during the Jacksonville event.

Critics of the bill, however, have warned that the Family Empowerment Scholarship Program likely will face a legal challenge.

The Florida Supreme Court in 2006 ruled that a similar program, spearheaded by then-Gov. Jeb Bush, was unconstitutional. That ruling, in a case known as Bush v. Holmes, said sending tax dollars to private schools violated part of the Florida Constitution requiring a “uniform system of free public schools.”

Florida Education Association President Fedrick Ingram contends “neighborhood public schools are under attack.” The teachers’ union is holding a “summit” May 18 in Orlando to discuss issues such as vouchers.

“If public education is going to have a future in Florida, it’s time for the people who care about our public schools to step forward and take control of the conversation,” Ingram said.

My mom was a nurse-turned-social worker who often worked long hours, as did my dad, before coming home to wrangle three rambunctious kids. When she was particularly exhausted, she used to sigh, “My get-up-and-go just got-up-and-went.”

Mama, I feel ya.

After the grueling final weeks of the legislative session with my day job (editor in the Senate bill drafting office), keeping up with the bangin’ spring music and culture scene with my side ride (this column and other bits for the Democrat) and wrapping up two freelance stories for another publication (somehow, miraculously, on deadline), I am plumb tuckered out. The well is dry. The tank is drained. The needle is buried on “empty.”

So I’m going to go away soon for a little vacation. Which means that for a few weeks, I won’t be monitoring and chronicling the scene in this column. My last Roundup before my holiday will be in next week’s May 17 Limelight, but I’ll be back in action for the June 14 Limelight.

Legendary bluesman Guitar Shorty may not do back flips, headstands and somersaults anymore, but he can still heat up the frets when he picks up the guitar. Shorty — a Kissimmee, Fla., native whose raw, scorching blues has been captured on such acclaimed releases as the aptly titled “Bare Knuckle” and “We the People” — was a regular visitor to Tallahassee before he moved to the Left Coast several years ago. He cut his teeth as a teen playing with Ray Charles’ band and has recorded with Willie Dixon and toured with T-Bone Walker, Big Joe Turner, Little Richard and Sam Cooke. Shorty even has a Hendrix connection — he married the late legend’s step-sister in 1961 and was an influence on the world-changing guitarist.

""Give me my [explitive!] Give me my [explitive]!"" the man yells at the woman after smashing the block into her vehicle.

The video, recorded Thursday, May 8, shows a tan vehicle parked sideways on San Miguel Drive in Port Richey, Florida. A black car is parked on the roadway in front of the tan car. The man, standing with his hand on the side of the tan vehicle, appears to yell at the person driving the black vehicle.

168,Bride shames wedding guest who allegedly brought '10 Tupperware containers' to take home leftovers,"- This guest is apparently a big fan of leftovers, and upsetting the bride.

A woman from western Pennsylvania wrote on Facebook’s immensely popular “That’s it I’m Wedding Shaming” group about an alleged incident involving her wedding and a very hungry guest.

“My husband and I had a very small wedding ceremony and reception, probably about 25 people were invited,” she writes. “Only close family and a handful of friends.”

However, a few days before the wedding her dad’s friend asked if he could bring his daughter and her husband to the nuptials — to which she said she “didn’t have a problem with it.”

“So [the daughter] shows up, without her husband, but with about 10 Tupperware containers. TO TAKE FOOD,” the outraged bride claims, stating her wedding was buffet style.

“She loaded up 7 Tupperware containers with food to take home, took about 3 containers of homemade cookies, a couple of bottles of beers, and most [of] the centerpieces,” she wrote.

Though the anonymous bride said she “didn’t notice any of this” at the time because she was busy tending to the other guests at the wedding, she said her dad told her about it the next day.

However, the bride’s frustration with the guest continued when she opened up the woman’s gift to the couple.

“And when we opened up our ‘gift’ from her — she gave us $5. Not even kidding. A five dollar bill.”

The bride went on to claim that the offending woman was “not poor by any stretch of the imagination,” and stated she was “probably better off than [the bride.]”

Those on the post were also horrified by the woman’s actions.

“She loaded up 7 Tupperware containers with food to take home, took about 3 containers of homemade cookies, a couple of bottles of beers, and most [of] the centerpieces,” the bride wrote of the offending guest.

“She loaded up 7 Tupperware containers with food to take home, took about 3 containers of homemade cookies, a couple of bottles of beers, and most [of] the centerpieces,” the bride wrote of the offending guest. (iStock)

""Some people have no shame, I would be mortified to scab off someone like this, esp (especially) at a wedding,” one wrote.

“Message her asking for money to cover the cost of the food and center pieces she took,” another suggested.

“Omg my in-laws (husband's aunts) did this at our engagement party. I didn't know what to say, and they are medical doctors too, so not poor,” one woman shared.

Though the bride was clearly not happy with where her buffet food went, at least she wasn’t shamed for the spread like this couple.

170,"'It was horrifying,' says woman who gave birth in Broward jail","Tammy Jackson was released from the hospital on Wednesday.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - Tammy Jackson -- the woman who gave birth, alone, in a Broward County jail cell -- is home Wednesday, and spoke to exclusively to Local 10 News about her ordeal.

Jackson suffers from a mental illness, bipolar schizophrenia, according to her mother, Shirley Nixon, who was with her when she was released from the hospital Wednesday after several days of mental health evaluation.

Her condition is delicate, and what happened to her is disturbing.

But, Jackson was determined to say what she had to say.

""If anything, blessed to be alive,"" Jackson said.

Her little girl, Miranda, who weighed 6 6 pounds, 7 ounces, was also released from the hospital Wednesday.

""I'm glad she's out and hopefully, things will fall into place, She'll get her the help she needs, and I can get my grandbaby,"" Nixon said.

Nixon learned from me that her granddaughter was not born in the hospital where she first held her.

She was born at the North Broward Bureau. She also learned that her daughter was alone in an isolation cell when she went into labor.

""It was horrifying. It was horrifying,"" Jackson said. ""When she fell, I had to bend down to pick her up and tell her, ‘I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that to happen.' She was still crying,"" Jackson said.

Later, at her home, I asked Jackson why she apologized to her baby.

""I didn't even get clean before I had her. Also, she had hit the floor, and to me that was hard because she was just coming out of me,"" Jackson said. ""I just apologized for her being in the jailhouse. The situation, because I would rather for my mom to be by my side in the hospital with me having her.""

Jackson was arrested this year and held on trespassing and drug charges.

She's struggled with homelessness and bipolar schizophrenia, according to her mother. An incident report details how a Broward County Sheriff's Office deputy saw Jackson inside her isolation cell the morning of April 10 ""screaming in pain.""

The deputy reported later hearing a baby crying and seeing Jackson holding her child in her arms before she was rushed to the hospital.

""It isn't a joke when it comes to pregnancy. And if they don't want to abide by that, they should get fired because I don't believe no woman should really have to go through that,"" Jackson said.

Asked if she thinks anyone will be held accountable for what happened, Jackson said, ""No, but they should. It was neglect ... emotional abuse.""

Jackson said she is looking forward to moving on from this and hopes to be reunited with her daughter soon.

On Wednesday, she gave herself a pep talk.

""You're a strong woman. Don't put yourself down not yet. Just be grateful and thankful that you're standing and, yes, you are strong,"" she said.

Jackson also thanked her public defender who worked to get her released on her own recognizance.

The public defender's office is working to see whether Jackson will be able to have her parental rights restored.

In the meantime, the internal affairs investigation into this incident continues.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (WFLA) – A woman was arrested for attempting to bring CBD oil into Disney World’s Magic Kingdom.

According to an arrest affidavit, on April 15, an Orange County deputy was working in an off-duty capacity at Magic Kingdom.

Disney World security personnel notified the deputy that potentially illegal narcotics, believed to be THC oil, had been located.

The employee said he found the THC oil, labeled “Select CBD” in the purse of Jordan Burkhalter, 69, when she put it on the table for inspection.

When the employee asked Burkhalter if it was CBD oil, she allegedly stated, “Is there a problem?”

She refused to answer if the bottle contained CBD oil.

The Orange County deputy tested the bottled using a marijuana presumptive drug test kit and got a positive result for the presence of THC.

Burkhalter was arrested for possession of hashish and trespassed from Disney property.

Troopers with the Florida Highway Patrol said Kyah Muntz has been charged in the death of Kavika Chugh, who was a passenger in the vehicle Muntz crashed into while driving while intoxicated.

[PREVIOUS: Woman, 23, killed in wrong-way, head-on crash on SR A1A in Brevard]

About a month after the Dec. 14 crash at the intersection of State Road A1A and Sabal Ridge Lane, blood tests revealed Muntz had a .101 blood alcohol level at the time of the crash, according to the report. She also tested positive for THC, troopers said.

The crash, which left Muntz severely injured, also left the driver and another passenger in the other vehicle hospitalized, according to the Highway Patrol.

Following the results of the lab work, Muntz was charged with driving under the influence and causing serious bodily injury, DUI damage to property and DUI manslaughter, records show.

She is being held in the Brevard County Jail without bond.

179,It's the police's job to protect. Profiling might be necessary| Opinion,"Buy Photo Marshall Frank is a retired Miami-Dade County police captain. (Photo: MALCOLM DENEMARK/FLORIDA TODAY)

Who said, “Damned if you do, damned if you don’t?”

Imagine this scenario:

Officers O’Keefe and Sullivan are patrolling midnight shift in a predominantly white, upscale neighborhood when they spot a Mercedes being driven by two black teens wearing baseball caps. It’s 1:30 a.m.

O’Keefe: ""Hey, Rudy, those guys don’t belong here. Let’s pull ‘em over.""

Sullivan: ""Forget it, Bill. Remember our orders, no stopping people because of race. Profiling can get us time off or fired.""

O’Keefe: ""But Rudy, those guys are cruising the neighborhood. What if they break in, or hurt someone?""

Sullivan: ""Tough. I don’t need an Internal Affairs complaint. Unless we see them commit a crime, we’re outta here.""

Tough choice these days.

Racial profiling by police officers was commonplace in America not long ago. I know. I was one of them. In 1960, my trainer taught me to look for poor blacks driving old jalopies with broken taillights and slick tires, a sure bet for padding the night’s work sheet. Raised in a segregated world, I thought nothing of it — then.

Once stopped, a radio name check would likely show that some of the occupants were wanted on a warrant for failing to pay a ticket or failing to appear in court. Good stats for the sergeant.

Retro guilt? Certainly. I can’t change the past, but I did change myself, as have millions of police officers and their departments during these last 50 years.

Indiscriminate racial profiling is a rarity today, yet people are quick to judge if and when police misconduct makes headlines. A very small percentage of cops may hold personal prejudices now and then, but the systemic application of profiling has been relegated to the history books. Media spotlight on any one incident is nothing more than sensationalism that stirs the pot.

Today, police agencies generally represent the ethnic and racial proportions of the community they serve. The importance of good race relations and the bane of profiling is part of police training in all four corners of the nation. It is not tolerated by any department. Yet, officers of the 21st century walk an insidious tightrope, ever-teetering between performing their jobs, protecting the public or yet, protecting their butts.

The fact remains: It’s a cop’s job to protect law abiding citizens. Thus, there may be occasions when profiling is warranted. A car weaving across lanes is a profile for a drunk driver. A parade of shoddy people coming in and out of a shanty all hours of day and night is a profile for drug activity. Two black teens cruising in a $40,000 car at 1:30 a.m. in a mostly white residential neighborhood — or white teens cruising in a black neighborhood — is cause for suspicion. If the cops don’t check them out, they’re not doing their job.

I knew of a woman and her daughter who were the victims of a multiple rape in their home by three men. The mom was brutally murdered. Prior to the assault, the killers had been cruising the neighborhood. Had the police spotted and pulled them over, that mother might have been a happy grandmother today.

I’d rather subscribe to the old adage: Better safe than sorry.

How would you choose?

180,Woman finds gator in garage after stepping on it,"- A Clermont family got first-hand experience on what it's like to live on a lake in Florida.

Mick Sprinkle says his wife walked into the garage and stepped on an alligator.

The alligator was tiny, and it didn't appear the mama was around, so Sprinkle shooed it out of the garage with a broom as it hissed at him. ""Do not hiss on me! You are in my garage!"" he says as the baby gator makes its way out into the driveway.

""We recently moved from MetroWest and don't see such things,"" Sprinkle laughed.

Sprinkle said he went back outside to check on the tiny gator but it was gone. ""I can only assume it made its way back to the lake behind the house,"" he said.

181,"Jabar Gaffney breaks his silence about vandalism case, other allegations","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Facing a felony charge in the vandalism of his former teammate's car and lingering accusations of bad behavior, Derrick ""Jabar"" Gaffney is going on the record -- saying he's been silent long enough and wants to set the record straight.

For the first time in years, the former football player says it's time to explain who he is and why he believes he is misunderstood.

Sitting in a conference room on the second floor of News4Jax studios, calm and focused, Gaffney told his side to the I-TEAM about accusations that have been made against him, his faith in God and family, and the game of football.

Jenese Harris: Do you remember the first time you picked up a football?

Jabar Gaffney: Yes, 2 years old. That was a gift that my mom and dad gave me, and I just ran with it.

Gaffney's talent is not just his own; it's embedded in his DNA. His father, Derrick, uncles Don, Warren and Johnny all played football, too.

His fans will say he was quick on his feet and with his hands as a football player for Raines High School in the 1997 state championship.

""I was a member of the '97 State team, got to catch the game winning touchdown in that game, and we were the first public school to win one,"" Gaffney said.

He got the attention of recruiters, but he stayed close to home and played as a wide receiver for the University of Florida before leaving after two years for a career in the NFL.

Accused of theft at UF

At times, his success on the field became a secondary headline. While at UF, Gaffney was accused of stealing $240 and a watch from Florida Field's locker room. He was dropped from the team.

Gaffney signed a deferred prosecution agreement for felony petty theft that included restitution, and the charges were dropped. He apologized and was allowed back on the team.

Accused of vandalism

Fast forward to the week of Father's Day in 2018, when the car of Gaffney's former teammate and friend Lito Sheppard is caught on surveillance camera being vandalized. According to the police report, Sheppard told investigators he believed the man seen in the video was Jabar Gaffney.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Allegations of vandalism

Sheppard posted a photo from the surveillance video of the incident on his Facebook page, and people began to post that the man had similar features to Gaffney, and they believed that he was the man with a mystery woman. Gaffney says he didn't do it and doesn't know why Sheppard is accusing him.

Sheppard and Jabar Gaffney were childhood friends, playing ball together in high school and college. But, their friendship turned sour.

Harris: When did it fall apart? Your relationship with Lito Sheppard?

Gaffney: I don't really know? Father's Day.

Harris: Of last year?

Gaffney: Yeah.

Harris: So everything between you and Lito Sheppard has been okay you had an okay relationship with him until last year when you were accused of vandalizing his vehicle?

Gaffney: Yes.

Gaffney insists he didn’t have a grudge against Sheppard and Gaffney insists he is not the man in the surveillance video damaging Sheppard's car.

Harris: So have you seen the video? The surveillance video or the photos at least of the surveillance video that people have alleged is you? Have you seen it?

Gaffney: Yes, I have seen it.

Harris: And people say that it's you?

Gaffney: I say that they are lying.

Harris: Where were you that day?

Gaffney: I was with my kids. I was at church, and then I spent the rest of that day with my kids at the house. We were watching movies and we left to go to Popeye's which is just a couple of miles down the street from my house and came back. That's where I was -- with my family.

Gaffney's arrest warrant obtained by the I-TEAM claims the night of the vandalism, another surveillance camera -- one from the Jacksonville neighborhood where Gaffney was living -- captured Gaffney and a woman leaving the neighborhood in the same Audi spotted a short time later pulling up to Sheppard's BMW in Jax Beach

Gaffney told us he was with his children that day, and he does not know who that woman is in the surveillance photos. He showed us a copy of a Popeye's transaction from his bank account from that same day that he said supports his claim of not being the person who vandalized Sheppard's car. However, the document does not show the time of the transaction made at the Neptune Beach restaurant.

""I have pictures of me on Father's Day showing what I look like. The guy in that picture, he looks like he had a haircut I have very long hair and again there's no tattoos and again the guy at the beach, it wasn't me,"" said Gaffney.

Gaffney told us despite the felony charge against him, and despite the fact that Sheppard filed a temporary restraining order that later expired, he still sees Sheppard as a brother.

Harris: If you could talk to Lito right now, what would you say?

Gaffney: Why? That's all I could say. Why? There is nothing else. He knows, he knows that I didn't do it. He knows that it was not me or else there would be all kinds of evidence.

Gaffney's next pre-trial hearing in the vandalism case is set for May 14 with jury selection in his trial set for May 20. However, his attorneys have filed a motion to delay the trial.

The I-TEAM reached out to Lito Sheppard for comment on Gaffney's interview and he said, ""I have nothing to comment about. I'll let him (Jabar Gaffney) proceed.""

Held under the Baker Act

Harris: There is the charge about the vandalism for the vehicle, then we hear information about you being suicidal or wanting to hurt yourself. What was that?

Gaffney: That was, I don't know. I don't know. That was girls being upset with me being brutally honest it was two girls that I was talking to and trying to make connections with and along the way things got turned ugly and we weren't going to see each other.

Gaffney: They made a call to police and said that I wanted to kill myself and that was totally false. I was on the way to Tampa that day. My son had a band recital. He was playing in the band and that was his first time he was going to be performing and I was going to see my son that day. I had never once tried to kill myself at all.

Harris: So then, how do you explain police being at that house and saying that you were taken and committed somewhere? Are you saying that never happened?

Gaffney: I just came out because I was getting phone calls and they were saying that the police were at my house. I said the police are not at my house, I'm in here. I got this call from my sister I told her no I'm fine. She was like are you sure? I was like, ain't nobody at my house because I didn't know that anything was going on. I had took a nap and I was getting ready to get on the road and I walked outside and it's like 50 guns pointed at me and I just I just dropped like I didn't know what to do I just froze up because that was terrifying. I didn't expect to see a whole bunch of guns drawn out on me in front of my house. They took me to the mental health place and locked me up there.

Gaffney said he was at the mental health facility for three days. Prior to arriving there, he said he got sick -- but it was not because he had ingested pills or was trying to kill himself.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Accusations of mental health issues, brain injury

""When I got to the place, they took a sample, drug tested me, didn't find anything. Didn't find no sleeping pills at all in my system. The police were at my house. They came in, they went through my house. There was no gun found in my house or anything,"" he said.

Gaffney said the women made a false claim to police.

Harris: So you are saying you were falsely committed in a mental facility for three days?

Gaffney: Yes.

Harris: What was it like being in there?

Gaffney: It was tough, but I mean I prayed about it and I was just like, God wouldn't have me here if it wasn't a reason behind it I guess. I mean it did good. I got to talk to a lot of people there about this and I talked to the doctor. He said that I was fine, that he just wanted me to stay because I could be a good influence on people that was the whole reason for keeping me there not because I was trying to commit suicide or because I had anything in my system. Got to meet with people, got to pray with people. Made friends with a skin head. I mean it was, I tried to make the best of it so that it wouldn't tear me down that I was in there for no reason.

Accused of having a brain injury from playing football

Shortly after Jabar Gaffney was held for three days, his uncle, Councilman Reggie Gaffney, spoke to the I-TEAM about Jabar. His uncle claimed Jabar's mood had changed. Jabar told us he didn't know his uncle was doing the interview until News4Jax called, asking Jabar for a statement about his uncle's comments.

Harris:​​​​​ What do you have to say about what your uncle said?

Gaffney: It was very disheartening to hear coming from him, when they don't even, me and my uncle, we don't even talk too much.

Harris: So as far as your uncle, do you feel like he even has the ability or the right to say what he is saying?

Gaffney: No, not at all, anybody in my family that should've answered that question should've been my dad or my mom or grandmother.

Gaffney told us his legal issues have reached the ears of his children. He said he comforts them, explaining their dad is fine.

Harris: How do you explain that to them?

Gaffney: Before they could say anything I said, ""You know I love you, right? You know your dad is not going anywhere?"" They said, ""We know."" They smile, (I) hug them and that's it. That's the end of the conversation.

Accused of domestic violence

Jabar Gaffney has also had protective orders filed against him, but he said he's never hit a woman. But, he said women have hit him.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Allegations of domestic violence

Harris: You've also been accused of domestic violence, what do you have to say to that?

Gaffney: That it was all false.

Harris: Why was it false?

Gaffney: Because it was, it was females that were upset and trying to take me down and one of their words was...one of their own words was I am going to take down your whole empire and they just got mad at me for whatever reason it may have been. And trying to take a shot at ruining my name.

Harris: So you never hit a woman in your life?

Gaffney: No.

Harris: Never hit a woman before?

Gaffney: No.

Harris: Never did anything against a woman?

Gaffney: No, never, never before. I have been hit a lot and I have called the police on women and nothing ever happened.

Harris: And why have they been assaulting you?

Gaffney: The same thing. Jealousy for whatever reason.

Accusations of being a ""troublemaker""

Harris: You have these incidents that keep happening and this person says to you, why you? Why do bad things keep happening to you and do you take an accountability for it?

Gaffney: I take accountability for everything that I have ever done in my life. I have always come clean on what I have done whether it was me by myself or other people with me. Like I have always just said my name and never told on anybody else.

For Gaffney, he believes the damage is already done. He told us his mistakes coupled with his name being tarnished has cost him honors at his alma mater.

Gaffney: It cost me part of my legacy with the University of Florida.

Harris: How so?

Gaffney: I am still not in the Athletic Hall of Fame right now. I am not in the Ring of Honor even though I meet the qualifications.

Gaffney: I was the best receiver that ever came through the University of Florida. There has never been a receiver that has two thousand-yard seasons back-to-back. Averaged 100 yards and a touchdown every game. Nobody has came through and done that at the university. Walter Camp, All-American everything, I was the team MVP, National Freshman of the Year, did everything to be in their Athletic Hall of Fame. But it seems like, after that Florida-Georgia thing and Hall of Fame induction, the hate started turning up a little more. The trouble came and from that point, I mean, it's 2019 and I still haven't been put in there, I mean, I know that has something to do with it.

For every accusation, Gaffney said he has been told to remain silent. He said he is tired of being silent. In breaking his silence, he recalls advice given to him from his former New England Patriots coach.

Gaffney: Coach Belichick always told us to speak for yourself so I am here to speak for myself I don't need anyone else to speaking for me anymore.

Harris: What is next for you in your life?

Gaffney: Just continuing what I have been doing, just trying to help the youth reach their potential work with Scott Park. Since we got Scott Park, we have kids going to college every year. It puts a smile on my face.

Gaffney said he has been working behind the scenes to help the youth football teams that practice and play there. As he helps the children with similar dreams of being an NFL star he is cutting people out of his personal life.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Accusations of being a ""troublemaker""

""I am going to continue to live my life, I cut, cut a lot of people out of my life that's how I have been able to stay out of the limelight without negative people around, without people that want to be in your business,"" said Gaffney.

He told us his faith in God keeps him centered.

""I am not saying that I lived a perfect life but I know I am not close to what I am being perceived as now and that's not fair,"" he explained.

Since this interview, Gaffney says he now has a medicinal marijuana card for Florida, which allows him to smoke cannabis for health reasons.

184,Nikki Fried on gas pump stickers: 'It's working',"<p>Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried has something to say about the stickers of her face that are prominently affixed to gas station pumps throughout the state: ""It's working.""</p>

<p>Fried, during a news conference Thursday to <a href=""https://www.local10.com/news/florida/broward/florida-agriculture-commissioner-other-leaders-warn-people-about-skimmer-scams"" target=""_blank"">discuss the growing risk of gas pump skimmer fraud</a> in South Florida, addressed the controversy surrounding her decision to modify the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services certification stickers.</p>

<p>""They're seeing that there's somebody who is accountable to what is happening at the gas station pumps,"" Fried said.</p>

<p>Whenever Fried's office conducts a gas pump inspection, a certification sticker is affixed to it. Unlike her Republican predecessor, Adam Putnam, who used the department's logo, Fried is using her smiling face.</p>

<p>Fried said the intent behind the sticker is ""making sure that the consumer is aware that there's somebody there who is watching out for their best interests.""</p>

<p>""That has always been our priority and that will continue to be our priority,"" she said.</p>

<p>Fried said the attention that the decal has received is proof that the strategy is working.</p>

<p>""Most people in the state of Florida didn't even know that there was a sticker on the gas station pumps until this change happened,"" Fried said.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But the change has prompted backlash from the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature, which included language in a budget implementation bill that requires the stickers to have ""only a combination of lettering, numbering, words or the department logo.""</p>

<p>""Our legal team is looking into it, but we're assessing it to see if, in fact, something has to be done for the future,"" Fried said.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, her office has purchased the stickers with her face on them for ""almost the entire state already.""</p>

<p>Fried said that, since the implementation bill takes effect July 1, the stickers are ""connected to future purchases.""</p>

186,"'Hundreds of bugs' in child's backpack, poor hygiene, leads to Florida mom's arrest","A Florida woman was arrested last week after her children's poor hygiene at school prompted a Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office inquiry into the family's home life, which discovered living conditions deemed unfit for children.

Jessica Stevenson, 33, was arrested Friday and charged with child neglect without causing great bodily harm. Her bond was set at $12,500.

According to her arrest report, a Bagdad Elementary School staff member made a Florida Department of Children and Families report concerning three siblings who attended the elementary school.

Based on that DCF report, the Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office opened an investigation April 18 into the living conditions of the students, the arrest report stated.

The employee said she’d noticed a second-grade student wearing the same clothing for an entire week in April and that the child’s body odor was hard to ignore, the report stated.

The employee questioned the second-grader as to when their last bath had been, the report stated. The student replied they did not know.

The employee said she provided the student with a new pair of clothing and took the old outfit. The old clothes were “severely soiled” with dirt caked into the fabric, the report stated.

Additionally, the employee informed investigators that “hundreds of bugs crawled out” of the student’s “backpack in the lunchroom,” the report stated.

The second-grade student has four siblings, according to the arrest report. The five siblings were between the ages of 5 and 14.

Three of the five children attended Bagdad Elementary School, the report stated.

Another teacher at Bagdad Elementary School told investigators that she’d met with the children’s caretaker, Jessica Stevenson. The teacher said Stevenson “immediately berated her after assuming it was her who called DCF,” the report stated.

The teacher said that she knew that one of the siblings had repeatedly been given new clothing by the school, the report stated.

Each new outfit would be worn continuously, day-after-after, until it was inevitably worn out, at which point, another new set of clothing would be provided by the school to the student, the report stated.

Additionally, the teacher said her student was frequently crying, “having meltdowns” and seemed depressed, the report stated.

When deputies visited the siblings’ residence they discovered a cockroach infestation. The report stated, “The roaches were on nearly every surface in the home” including “on the children’s mattress, in the pots and pans in the kitchen, and inside the cabinets/fridge.”

The cabinets were empty of food, and the refrigerator contained two cartons of rancid milk, spoiled eggs, some sugar and a stick of butter, the report stated. A plugged in microwave dangled out of a window by its cord.

Overall, the home was “filthy,” the report stated, except for Stevenson’s bedroom. Compared to the rest of the home, Stevenson’s bedroom was clean with minimal roaches and had a stashed bag of snacks.

Stevenson made bond the day after her arrest and was released from custody on May 4.

188,Registered sex offender accused of publicly masturbating at UCF's campus,"Malik Gaither seen in a surveillance photo and in a mug shot, according to UCF police.

ORLANDO, Fla. - A registered sex offender is accused of publicly masturbating in front of students at the University of Central Florida on Tuesday, according to authorities.

The UCF Police Department said a woman reported that she was getting into her car, which was parked in a lot near Garage I, when she noticed a man, later identified as Malik Gaither, touching himself inappropriately while looking in her direction.

Police said they searched the campus and noticed a man who matched the description provided by the witness. Gaither, 25, abandoned a backpack and began walking faster when he noticed an officer approaching him, according to the report.

While investigating, police said they found surveillance video that showed Gaither masturbating near a woman who was on the phone and appeared to be unaware outside Trevor Colbourn Hall.

The backpack in Gaither's possession had been reported stolen by a student, according to the affidavit. It contained a laptop, headphones, $300 cash and a plane ticket with the victim's name on it, authorities said.

Police said Gaither has no ties to the university. He was trespassed from campus and arrested on charges of exposure of sexual organs, grand theft and loitering/prowling.

Records from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement show Gaither was adjudicated on a sexual battery charge in 2007, when he was a juvenile.

A mentally ill woman had to give birth alone in a Broward County, Florida, jail cell, almost seven hours after asking for medical assistance, her lawyers said in a letter to the sheriff.Calling their client's treatment ""outrageous and inhumane,"" public defenders Howard Finkelstein and Gordon Weekes Jr. said jail and medical personnel knew Tammy Jackson was full term when she complained early April 10 that she was having contractions and requested help.The staff did not take Jackson to a hospital, the lawyers further told Sheriff Gregory Tony. Rather, at 3:16 a.m., they tried to contact an on-call doctor, who could not be reached until 7:22 a.m., according to the attorneys.The doctor said he would check on Jackson when he arrived at the jail, the letter said.An hour and 38 minutes later, Jackson told her lawyers, she was still in the jail cell by herself, bleeding, ""and no urgency was demonstrated by your staff,"" the lawyers wrote.""Six hours and 54 minutes after asking for help, a (Broward Sheriff's Office) tech notified medical staff that Ms. Jackson was holding her newborn baby in her arms, having delivered the baby without medication or the assistance of a physician,"" the letter said.The sheriff's office has launched an investigation into the delivery, said spokeswoman Gina Carter. A doctor and two nurses provided Jackson care after she gave birth at the North Broward Bureau, Carter said, and the child ""was placed with an appropriate caregiver.""After providing a short statement via email, Carter said CNN would have to file an official records request to see the incident report filed after Jackson gave birth.The North Broward Bureau houses minimum- and medium-security offenders and its main mission is to manage ""the mentally ill, medically infirm and special needs inmate population,"" according to the sheriff's office.Since Jackson's arrest in April, her lawyers said, she had been placed in an infirmary for monitoring.""The birth was not premature or unexpected,"" their letter said. ""Yet in her time of extreme need and vulnerability, BSO neglected to provide Ms. Jackson with the assistance and medical care all mothers need and deserve.""Not only was Ms. Jackson's health callously ignored, the life of her child was also put at grave risk.""How the incident will affect the woman's ""already fragile mental health"" remains to be determined, the lawyers said.Other inmates heard Jackson's screams during labor, CNN affiliate WPLG reported.

WEST MILFORD, N.J. (AP) — A woman has been charged in the death of a 10-week-old puppy whose body was found submerged and in a weighted cage in a northern New Jersey pond.

193,"Woman who set fire, stabbed deputy gets year in prison","- A Florida woman who set her ex-boyfriend's house on fire and stabbed a deputy has been sentenced to a year and a day in prison.

The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports 27-year-old Brittany Bonin was sentenced Monday after pleading no contest to charges including of first-degree arson and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. She'll get credit for 314 days spent in county jail, meaning she'll serve another 52 in state prison.

Authorities say Bonin set fire to her ex-boyfriend's Edgewater home in 2017. The ex-boyfriend went to get help from a neighbor, who was a captain with the Volusia County Sheriff's Office. The neighbor called 911 and reported that Bonin stabbed him in the lower back while he was trying to restrain her.

Bonin's attorney said Bonin was remorseful and that her ex-boyfriend had been physically and emotionally abusive.

199,"Lake City police: Woman beaten, raped, held captive for hours","LAKE CITY, Fla. - A Lake City woman was held captive in her home, beaten and raped during a three-hour period of time, according to an arrest report obtained by News4Jax.

The Lake City Police Department identified the suspect as Ernest Lee Wilson.

Wilson, 61, of Lake City, was already on probation when he was arrested Sunday morning on charges of battery, sexual assault, false imprisonment and trespassing.

According to the arrest report, the incident happened late Saturday night and carried over into early Sunday morning at the woman's home. The report suggests Wilson and the woman knew each other.

The woman told police that Wilson showed up at her doorstep around 9 p.m. Saturday and began to apologize to her while slowly walking his way into her home, despite having a no trespass warning previously issued against him, according to police. The report states that at some point, Wilson’s apology turned into him arguing with her and questioning her about relationships she was having with other men.

According to the report, the argument turned physical when Wilson attacked the woman by striking her multiple times in the head and body.

The report states the woman told investigators that Wilson raped her after forcing her to take off her clothing. According to the report, the sexual assault lasted for three hours. At one point during the assault, the woman grabbed her phone and attempted to call 911 when she said Wilson took the phone away and disabled it by removing the battery. After the phone was disabled, the woman told police she tried to run out the front door, but Wilson grabbed her by the hair and pulled her back into the home as she screamed for help, the report states.

Once the woman was back in the house, according to the report, she was physically assaulted again. The woman told police that while inside the home, she managed to gain access to a second phone and called 911. The report states that Wilson ran from the home when he realized police were on the way.

Officers located Wilson on Southwest Arlington Boulevard, where he was taken into custody.

Wilson is no stranger to the Lake City police. Court record show he has a past arrests on charges of:

Battery on law enforcement

Felony battery

Corruption by threat

According to the Florida Department of Corrections, Wilson (pictured in previous FDOC photo) has been in and out of jail and prison since the late 1970s for convictions on charges that include:

Burglary

Grand theft

Battery on law enforcement

Felony battery

Threatening unlawful harm

His last release from prison was in 2013.

When Wilson went before a judge on the new charges, his bond was set at $159,000, but because there is a hold on him for a probation violation out of Hamilton County, a judge ordered he be held without bond on the probation violation.

201,Two people surrender to police after standoff on West Lloyd Street,"CLOSE A SWAT team begins to move toward a home on West Lloyd Street where a man allegedly fired shots. Colin Warren-Hicks, Pensacola

Two people surrendered to authorities Friday after a more than two-hour standoff with law enforcement at a home on West Lloyd Street where a person had barricaded themselves inside.

One man and one woman were taken into police custody. As of 5 p.m. Friday, authorities had not released their names or announced charges against them.

The two people surrendered shortly before noon after the SWAT team, carrying AR-15 assault rifles and at least one shotgun, approached the home.

Shots were fired at 9:31 a.m. in the backyard of the house at 1101 W. Lloyd St. and law enforcement was notified a minute later, according to Pensacola Police Department spokesman Mike Wood.

Officers arrived at the house at 9:34 a.m., at which time, the person who had fired the shots had retreated inside and barricaded themselves inside the home, Wood said.

By 9:50 a.m., officers had encircled the house near the corner of Lloyd and G streets and closed streets within a one-block radius of the intersection to both car and pedestrian traffic. All neighbors were advised to take shelter.

Officers attempted to contact the person inside the home via megaphone, a house phone line and cellphones to no avail, Wood said. A warning over the megaphone stated that a SWAT team was en route, but no one inside the home responded, according to authorities.

Isaiah Henry, 40, of Pensacola, was riding his bike north on H Street around 9:45 a.m. when he encountered one of the roadblocks around West Lloyd Street.

""I've lived here all my life and seen a lot of crazy stuff, but this really tops it all,"" he said. ""This is a quiet neighborhood.""

Henry said he has a child who lives several blocks away with their mother.

""It’s really shocking, really. Other than the regular traffic stop, you really don’t see this type of thing around here,” Henry said, gesturing toward a scene of law enforcement cruisers, trucks, crime scene tape and busy investigators.

Nearby, one school had been placed on lockdown.

All teachers and children at the A.A. Dixon Early Head Start Center at 1201 North H St. were forced to remain in their classrooms until the standoff ended, according to the school’s social services advocate.

The school is approximately two blocks from 1101 W. Lloyd St. and was less than 200 yards from the police’s mobile command center. Escambia County School District Superintendent Malcolm Thomas confirmed no other schools went on lockdown due to Friday’s incident.

Emergency response vehicles continued to arrive throughout the morning as police parked SUVs with flashing lights in the center of streets, further fortifying their roadblocks.

By 11 a.m., the SWAT team arrived and began to assemble a block away from the barricaded home. Shortly after 11:45 a.m., SWAT members wearing body armor moved as a unit down the street.

By 11:56 a.m., police announced two suspects had surrendered to authorities. Following standard protocol, SWAT cleared the house. The team checked for additional suspects but found none.

""The house has been cleared. It is all over,"" Wood said at 12:02 p.m.

202,"Adopted mom of Dericka Lindsay found guilty of manslaughter, child abuse","When Dericka Lindsay was face-down in a chair, her cousin's weight crushing the air out of her lungs, the young girl's mom wasn't concerned that the child couldn't breathe, a prosecutor alleged.

She wasn't concerned that the 9-year was being ""disciplined"" too harshly.

Her concern was whether the discipline was harsh enough.

That was the case Assistant State Attorney Amy Shea made to jurors in her closing argument Friday in the trial of Grace Joan Smith, and if the verdict is any evidence, jurors were convinced.

It only took jurors about 2.5 hours to find Smith, 71, guilty of aggravated manslaughter of a child and aggravated child abuse.

Smith was one of the three adults in the room when Veronica Green Posey sat on Dericka in an effort to discipline the ""unruly"" child. However, Posey weighed about 320 pounds at the time, and Dericka was unable to draw any breath with Posey on top of her.

► Grace Smith:Woman charged in death of child will be treated for delirium, 'failure to thrive'

► Veronica Posey: Dericka Lindsay case: Woman convicted of murder, sentenced to life for sitting on child

► James Smith:Man sentenced in death of adopted 9-year-old who was sat on

The state argued Smith failed in her duty to protect her child, and engaged in aggravated child abuse that went far beyond what was necessary, reasonable or legal.

Smith's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Bradley Rowe, argued Smith had simply asked a trusted family member help her control a rebellious child, and things had gotten out of hand before she realized it.

Showing photos from the Smith's Navy Point home, Shea described it as a ""house of horrors"" for Dericka and the girl's younger sister. The girls' room had barely any furniture or toys to keep the children occupied.

During an autopsy, the medical examiner found Dericka had severe bruising on her rear indicative of regular and vicious spankings. Dericka had repeatedly tried to run away, and the night before her death she tried to pick the lock on the front door with a kitchen knife and escape.

The autopsy revealed Dericka had been wearing four pairs of panties when she died, which officials interpreted as the girl trying to give herself a little padding in preparation for her next spanking.

""That's all she had to protect herself from what she knew was coming,"" Shea said.

Smith called Posey to help her discipline Dericka for threatening her with a knife and hammer. Both women spanked Dericka, hitting her with a belt, a pipe and a ruler that snapped under the force of the strikes.

According to the evidence, Dericka was running and resisting during the beating, which prompted Posey to sit on her to hold her still.

Twice during the punishment Dericka said she couldn't breathe, and Shea said that Smith had a duty to intervene. Instead — as Smith attested in a recorded interview with Escambia County Sheriff's Office investigators — Smith was more focused on whether the punishment was enough to get Dericka to behave.

""When she says, 'I can't breathe,' (Smith) is thinking, 'Is (Dericka) going to change her behavior?'"" Shea said. ""A reasonable parent is not going to let the child suffer to the point of death to prove their point.""

Bradley Rowe, Smith's attorney, said the Smiths never imagined Posey would kill Dericka, and that everything happened in a span of just a few minutes. He argued from Smith's vantage point, she thought Posey was straddling the arms of the chair and not actually putting her full weight on the girl.

""Grace trusted her niece Veronica. She trusted her completely ... . She was family. She was her niece,"" Rowe said.

Rowe urged jurors not to blame Smith for Posey's actions, but jurors wasted no time indicating they found Smith just as responsible for the child's death.

Judge Jan Shackelford has tentatively set Smith's sentencing date for May 28. The judge also denied Smith's request for bond pending her sentencing.

Grace Smith's husband, James, pleaded no contest to aggravated manslaughter charges and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. Posey was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment for her role in the incident.

204,NASA is using the same spacesuits astronauts wore 30 years ago. Experts say that needs to change.,"When astronauts Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson conducted the space shuttle program’s first spacewalk in 1983, they probably wouldn’t have imagined their spacesuits would still be in use on the International Space Station some 36 years later.

Not only are they still in use but the suits, intended to last 15 years, are currently the only ones available for astronauts whizzing around Earth at thousands of miles per hour.

Now, as NASA prepares to head back to the moon, the agency must scramble to develop a next-generation suit or the next American astronauts will be forced to don some hand-me-down, 1980s equipment.

Sure, the suits get updated after six years in orbit or 25 spacewalks, but with outdated technology and only a limited quantity available, the fact of the matter is the nearly 40-year-old suits NASA employs will not serve the needs of future moonwalkers.

The current spacesuits are expected to last until 2028 – four years after NASA hopes to land astronauts on the moon again.But a series of incidents and issues from the spacesuits suggests the need for change is more urgent. A recent example is the all-female spacewalk cancellation in March, which instead had a male and female astronaut perform the walk.

NASA has known for a while that it needs to update its spacesuits. The agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel reiterated the urgency to develop the next-generation suit during a meeting last month.

In 2017, a similar report by NASA's inspector general came to the same conclusion and stated ""the agency remains years away from having a flight-ready spacesuit capable of replacing the EMU or suitable for use on future exploration missions.""

EMUs, or Extravehicular Mobility Units, are the current suits used on the ISS.

Considered to be a “mini spacecraft” in itself, the spacesuit astronauts currently wear to survive the harsh environment of space is complex and requires major modifications based on the user.

""The EMU, of course, is very bulky. It's a big, bulky, awkward suit to work in,"" former NASA astronaut Winston Scott told FLORIDA TODAY. ""But your life depends on it. It is a totally self-contained life support system.""

Since the retirement of the shuttle program in 2011, ""NASA has had limited ability to return the EMUs from the ISS because only one of the commercial vehicles that ferry supplies to the station has the capability to return items to Earth,"" according to the inspector general's report.

""As a result, astronauts are using the EMUs for much longer periods of time between maintenance and refurbishment than originally intended,"" the report reads.

And only 11 of the 18 ""EMU Primary Life Support System units,"" backpack-like structures required to keep astronauts alive when conducting spacewalks, are still in use. Five were destroyed in the Challenger and Columbia disasters as well as the SpaceX cargo mission that broke apart in 2015. Another was lost during ground testing and the last was built for certification only and is not suitable for flight.

NASA has had years to develop a next-generation spacesuit, but a ""lack of a formal plan and specific destinations for future missions has complicated spacesuit development,"" the report noted.

Starting in 2005 with the establishment of the Constellation program, which called for the development of a suite of vehicles to take astronauts back to the moon and beyond, NASA has spent almost $200 million on three spacesuit development efforts.

On May 1, NASA said on Twitter there would be a ""transition suit"" for the first mission to return to the moon that would include modern designs for astronauts to explore the lunar surface. As to what those advancements will be or what the transition suit will entail, the agency is still unsure.

""We’re looking at internal and external options for a transition spacesuit for the Moon 2024 landing with American astronauts as well as options for modern spacesuits for sustainable surface missions,"" NASA spokeswoman Cheryl Warner said.

Possible future spacesuits

As part of 18 studies being funded by NASA, the SmartSuit project would be an intelligent suit that would increase human performance and allow astronauts to travel to other celestial bodies like the moon and Mars. (Photo: NASA)

On the local front, Florida Institute of Technology academics have their own ideas on how to upgrade NASA's spacesuits.

In 2016, Ondrej Doule, director and founder of the university's Human Spaceflight Laboratory, along with students and team members, won the grand prize for their design of the interior of a single-person spacecraft in the Genesis Engineering Solutions competition.

The ""Wholly Human Integrated Single Person Spacecraft"" could replace the current spacesuits, Doule said. Instead of modeling the single-person spacecraft to look like a suit, the device would essentially become a mini-spacecraft with robotic arms and would have enough room for one astronaut.

Not only could any astronaut perform spacewalks regardless of their body shape, the walks would also be safer to perform because the robotic arms, operated by the astronauts, would do all the repairs needed outside of the space station instead of actual people, Doule said.

Though NASA does not know what the next spacesuit will look like, the agency is casting a wide net in its search.

As part of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, the agency is funding 18 studies, one of which includes the development of a ""SmartSuit,"" an intelligent suit designed with self-healing skin and data collection for spacewalks in extreme environments, NASA said last month.

The SmartSuit could be used to travel to other celestial bodies like the moon and Mars, and will incorporate ""soft-robotics technology that allows astronauts to be highly mobile and better interact with their surroundings,"" according to the release.

The $125,000 project, however, is only in the first phase and can only receive additional funding after successful studies and a transition to the second phase.

Scott, who conducted three spacewalks in NASA's current spacesuit, has his own wishes for how future suits should operate.

""An ideal spacesuit would be one that you don't even think about while you're wearing it,"" Scott said. ""So that means the suit would be light. It would fit you, it wouldn't be big and bulky.""

Instead of inhibiting movement, vision or restricting the astronaut in any way, Scott hopes for a much lighter, tighter-fit suit that still protects the astronaut. He also wouldn't mind an ""Iron Man"" version of a spacesuit.

""Perhaps the suit will be smaller and lighter than what we have, but maybe with some human assist functions like some robotics inside the suit to help you move,"" Scott said. ""Like the suits we develop for our military, the super soldier suits. Like the real version of Iron Man.""

Current suits won't work for deep space missions

With the race back on to send humans to the moon again by 2024, why won't the current spacesuits work if they've already been approved to last until 2028?

According to the inspector general's report, spacesuit requirements vary for each mission. A spacesuit designed for the moon has different needs than one for Mars since ""each destination has different temperatures, radiation levels, pressures, mobility requirements, and exposure to dust and debris.""

Though the current spacesuits are sufficient for use aboard the space station, it won't suffice for deep space exploration missions.

""For example, the current EMU lacks the hip and flexibility needed to walk on and explore planetary surfaces,"" the report reads.

Typically, spacesuits are designed with the mission in mind.

Custom-fit suits were made specifically for astronauts of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions. But with the shuttle program, NASA took a different approach.

As the astronaut class grew larger, it became too expensive to custom-tailor each suit to each astronaut. Instead, NASA’s current suits are a combination of several detachable parts that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

This allows multiple astronauts to wear the same suit, something the agency has done since the 1980s. But that's not to say they haven't come with their own sets of issues.

Past incidents and current issues

CLOSE Astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch were to make landmark history, but NASA canceled it keeping their safety in mind before anything else. USA TODAY

In March, NASA was planning the first all-female spacewalk with astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch. But a lack of readily available spacesuits aboard the space station prevented a historic event from occurring.

With limited sizes available, sometimes astronauts — usually females — cannot perform spacewalks due to sizing issues with available spacesuits, NASA design engineer Elizabeth Benson said in a 2009 paper named ""Complexity of Sizing for Space Suit Applications.""

This was essentially the problem with the planned all-female spacewalk – both McClain and Koch required mediums, but there was only one on board that would be ready in time, NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz said. The spacewalk did happen, just not with two female astronauts. Instead, NASA astronaut Nick Hague took over McClain's spot and accompanied Koch on the walk.

A simple solution would have been making more sizes available, but due to high costs, NASA had to downgrade the options to only medium, large and extra large sizes, preventing smaller astronauts from wearing the suits and conducting spacewalks.

And if limited sizing and quantity weren't already issues, according to NASA, a spacesuit weighs approximately 280 pounds on the ground. In space, it may not weigh anything, but that still doesn't mean astronauts aren't carrying around all that mass, Scott said.

""Its bulk makes it difficult to work in and some of the smaller stature people or some of the weaker physical people can't manipulate the suit,"" Scott said. ""And of course, they may or may not be able to conduct a spacewalk.""

Kathryn Sullivan, the first American woman to perform a spacewalk in 1985, had her own issues with the suit. In an interview with Outside Magazine in April, Sullivan explained how the suit never fit her correctly.

""The suit's knee was a bit above mine,"" she told the magazine. ""Every time I needed to bend, I wasn't bending a natural joint.""

Astronaut Linda Godwin also told the magazine the shoulders of the spacesuit were the biggest issue.

The suits were initially designed to fit a wide variety of both women and men, but that changed after the agency cut back in sizes.

Astronaut Peggy Whitson, who holds the American record for time spent in space, said in a documentary interview: ""As a woman, doing spacewalks is more challenging, mostly because the suits are sized bigger than the average female.""

So why is this a big deal?

As men and women of different shapes and sizes join NASA's astronaut corps, a poorly fitted suit not only prevents certain astronauts from conducting spacewalks, but ""can also increase the effort that a wearer must exert to move in the suit, since their joints are not lined up with the suit joints,"" Benson said.

""Also, a poorly fit suit has the potential to actually impinge on the wearer during motion and lead to a reduction in mobility and risk of injury,"" she said.

In space, astronauts are essentially floating within their pressurized spacesuit, Scott said. Because the suit is pressurized, which basically means the suit is inflated like a balloon, a common problem astronauts find when wearing the suit is the ability to bend their joints.

""Imagine you're trying to reach for a tool in space and you're reaching to wrap your fingers around the tool. When you try to close and open your fingers, your suit is working against you because it's pressurized,"" Scott said.

In fact, since they were designed in the 1970s, there have been more than 3,400 anomalies with the current spacesuits, according to the inspector general's report. They range from a loose boot thread to glove damage, uncomfortable body temperatures and helmet water intrusions.

Such was the case in 2013 when European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano reported water, a little over a third of a gallon, in his helmet while conducting a spacewalk. A similar instance occurred again in 2016 with NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra. Both spacewalks were terminated early.

None of the incidents that occurred during spacewalks have resulted in deaths or serious injuries, and only five were terminated early. But that's not to say a new spacesuit isn't necessary for future space exploration.

""As we go forward in space, we need to figure out ways to build suits that provide the protection that you need,"" Scott said. ""But also that are lighter and more flexible and better able to allow a person to work in them.""

205,Eric Yutzy reunites with birth mother nearly 4 decades later,"Local 10 News anchor Eric Yutzy shares a tender embrace with his birth mother for the first time since she gave him up for adoption as a baby.

MIAMI - After nearly four decades knowing just one image of my birth mother and just weeks after hearing her voice for the first time I can remember, we were finally going to meet face to face.

My family went with me to the Hyde Midtown Miami, where the hotel reserved a special room for the reunion.

""It's weird to look at somebody and see yourself,"" I said. ""I've never had that in my entire life.""

""That's true,"" Lisa said. ""That's true, but I'm looking at you and I'm like, 'Holy mackerel, you are us.'""

Local 10 News anchor Eric Yutzy hugs his birth mother during a meeting at the Hyde Midtown Miami.

It was surreal to meet the woman who gave me life and then gave me up so I could have a better life.

""I was 16, you know what I mean? And you needed more than I could give you,"" Lisa said.

""You're amazing,"" I told her.

""No, I'm not,"" she replied.

""Yes, you are,"" I said. ""Because, I mean, it's one thing to say you'll do something, but it's another thing to do it.""

""It was rough,"" Lisa explained. ""You know, it was really hard, because I got to hold you and I got to feed you and I got to change your diaper, but I talked to your mom and I knew then that I was doing the right thing.""

My four children immediately gravitated to their new ""abuela.""

Eric Yutzy, his wife and children posed for a picture with their new ""abuela"" for the first time.

""We have a lifetime of questions and answers,"" I told her.

""Yeah we do,"" she said, laughing. ""We do.""

""And the best part of that is that door is open,"" I continued. ""That conversation is open. This is the beginning of an addition to our family, almost a homecoming. I mean, there's so many parts of this that looking forward makes it so exciting because now you've got these four in your world.""

I've been calling Lisa ""mom,"" filling her in on the little things many mothers know about their children -- favorite foods, friends and memories. I've been getting answers to the questions that have hovered in my head and heart for years.

""Would you do it again?"" I asked her.

""At 16, yes, because look at who you are now,"" she said. ""I wouldn't change that for the world.""

I thanked her and told her, ""I love you.""

""I love you, too,"" she said.

""I'm so thankful and grateful for what you did for me,"" I told her.

206,Mother charged after throwing baby in dumpster in West Boca Raton; Deputies,"Update:



Deputies have charged Rafaelle Sousa with cruelty towards a child and attempted felony murder after they say she abandoned her newborn baby.

In her interview, police say Rafaelle admitted to delivering the baby, placing her in a bag and throwing her in a dumpster.

She is set to appear in court this morning.

CBS12 News will continue to follow this story





Detectives say the woman who they called a person of interest has been charged and booked into the Palm Beach County Jail.

Palm Beach County deputies confirm that she's the mother of the newborn baby found inside a dumpster at the Alister Apartments on Boca Entrada Boulevard.

Maria Saenz lives next door to the mother of the newborn and says she never knew she was expecting.

""She was really slim,"" she said. ""We never thought she was pregnant, maybe because she didn't have that much of a belly.""

The mother was transported to West Boca Medical Center and examined by doctors. Saenz says the woman is originally from Brazil, in her mid-30s, married and is the mother of a 3-year-old boy.

""He's a very happy little boy,"" Saenz said. ""I would always say hi to him and he always had a big smile.""

No word yet on what the charges are. The mother is expected to stand before a judge Friday morning.

209,Tom Cruise visits NAS Pensacola to speak at private event,"CLOSE Tom Cruise has found a familiar wingman for ""Top Gun 2."" Time

The ""Top Gun"" himself swung through Pensacola Tuesday morning for a private event at Naval Air Station Pensacola.

Tom Cruise, who played the role of hot shot fighter pilot Capt. Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell in the iconic 1986 ""Top Gun"" film, delighted real life naval aviators and flight officers at this year's Aviation Flag Officers Training Symposium with a speech.

Retired Marine Lt. Gen. Duane Thiessen, director of the National Naval Aviation Museum Foundation, confirmed that Cruise visited NAS Pensacola for a private event that was not related to the museum.

Thiessen said the actor was at the base for a short period of time.

Cruise has already filmed a sequel to ""Top Gun"" called ""Top Gun: Maverick."" The action movie is set for a 2020 release.

Cruise's Paramount Pictures publicist declined to comment on the actor's Pensacola visit.

But news of the star's trip to Pensacola spilled onto social media Tuesday when a military wife gushed over the experience in a Facebook status. Her post read:

""I kid you not, I am in Pensacola, for AFOTS, and Tom Cruise was the first presenter and gave us a sneak peek at what he is doing for the new TOP GUN/ MAVERICK!!! Coming out Summer 2020. (Aviation Flag Officers Training Symposium) cell phones were all secured, no pictures allowed.""

Naturally, her Facebook friends were inquisitive, and the Virginia resident was happy to offer more details in the comment section of her post.

When asked if Cruise wore a uniform, the woman responded with: ""No. Black Jeans and a sweater. Aviator sunglasses, tucked into the neck line.""

To a user who asked if the woman personally met the ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Risky Business"" star, she replied: ""There were over a hundred people in the room, so no personal contact. We also have a schedule to keep. I was thrilled to be sitting next to my own Top Gun guy, in his flight suit.""

Over the years, Cruise has publicly talked about how he flew in an F-14 with the Blue Angels during the filming of the original ""Top Gun.""

Like many who have fallen victim before and after him, Cruise has confirmed he did indeed puke while airborne.

210,Dericka Lindsay's adopted mom stands trial in her death,"Grace Smith suffered severe diabetes, and sometimes the 69-year-old's legs and feet got so swollen she couldn't wear shoes or walk around her own house.

In her condition, Smith was weaker than her 9-year-old adopted daughter, the woman's attorney said, and sometimes she asked for help keeping the ""unruly girl"" under control.

Smith never intended or imagined that her attempts at discipline would lead to the child's death, Smith's attorney argued in the first day of her trial Thursday.

Smith is charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child and aggravated child abuse in connection with the October 2017 death of Dericka Chavonne Lindsey, a young girl who suffocated when her 320-pound cousin, Veronica Posey, sat on her as a form of discipline.

Veronica Posey: Woman convicted of murder, sentenced to life for sitting on child

James Smith: Man sentenced in death of adopted 9-year-old who was sat on

In her opening statements to jurors Thursday, Assistant State Attorney Amy Shea said Posey was charged with murder for what she did to Dericka, but Smith was being charged because ""she failed to do her duty as a parent and protect her child from the abuse of another person.""

Shea said that before Dericka's death, the child had threatened Grace Smith and her husband, James, with a knife and a hammer. Smith called Posey over to her Navy Point home, and when she arrived both women spanked Dericka using a belt, a ruler and a small pipe.

When the girl resisted, she was made to kneel on the floor with her torso bent forward over the seat of an arm chair, and Posey put her weight on the girl's torso. A minute or two into the ""punishment,"" Dericka said she couldn't breathe, but Posey didn't move. A little while later Dericka repeated that she couldn't breathe, and Posey got up, but at that point Dericka had already lost her pulse.

A later autopsy revealed that Lindsey had severe bruising on her buttocks that appeared to be the result of severe, repeated beatings. The medical examiner said during Posey's trial that the bruising was the worst of its type she had ever seen.

Shea said the discipline meted out against Dericka ""goes far beyond what punishment is permitted by the law,"" and she noted that although Smith was frail, ""that doesn't stop her from beating that child, and it doesn't stop her from inviting (Posey's) abuse into her home.""

Case unfolds

Initial arrest: Pensacola child dies after 325-pound adult sat on her as punishment

Charges upgraded: State upgrades charges for 2 allegedly involved in child's punishment death

Autopsy: Lindsay had bruising, brain swelling after cousin allegedly sat on her

Additional charges: Three defendants face additional child abuse charge

Audio: 911 call released from Dericka Lindsay death

Smith's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Bradley Rowe, said that Smith and her husband had been caring for Dericka for most of the girl's life and they loved her dearly. But while the Smiths was getting older and weaker, Dericka was ""getting bigger, stronger and more defiant everyday,"" he said.

Rowe said the couple trusted Posey to help them discipline Dercika because she was an evangelical minister who had children of her own, and sometimes she was able to get the 9-year-old to behave just by using the right words.

► Community gathers to honor, remember girl allegedly killed by cousin

► Dericka Lindsay's school installs 'buddy bench' after 9-year-old's alleged abuse death

► Dericka Lindsay death: Parents, friends say girl with troubled home life was happy, bubbly

When she did resort to corporal punishment, the Smiths never thought Dericka would come to any real harm, Rowe suggested. He said the incident involving Posey and the chair happened so quickly that the Smiths didn't understand the tragic consequences until it was already too late.

""(Posey did not sit on Dericka) at the direction, encouragement, recommendation or order of Grace (Smith),"" Rowe told jurors. ""... She loved her daughter. She didn't want her daughter to die.""

Smith's trial is expected to wrap up Friday.

James Smith, who was also charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child, plead no contest to his charges and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. A jury convicted Posey of first-degree murder, and she was issued the mandatory life sentence for her role in the death.

212,"UF student, 22, charged with sexual battery","A Gainesville man accused of sexually battering a woman on March 22 after spending time in a bar was arrested by the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office.

Maxim Emilio Portillo, 22, of 6418 SW 90th St., was charged with one count of sexual battery, according to an arrest report.

The woman told authorities she has known Portillo for about five years and they went to school together. They were at a bar with two of Portillo’s friends.

She told deputies she had two drinks, well within her tolerance level. However, she became ill and disoriented. She vomited in the bathroom. The group left in an Uber, but she became sick again so the Uber driver let her and Portillo out.

Portillo hailed a Lyft. The driver told deputies the woman was extremely intoxicated and that he had to stop so she could vomit. Portillo also seemed drunk but was steady on his feet, the driver said. They were eventually dropped off at Portillo’s home.

The woman told authorities he sexually battered her there, first on his sister’s bed and then on a couch in the room, where he reportedly put a pillow over her face. She said she repeatedly told him to stop.

""The victim was so impaired she was unable to resist the defendant's attack and unable to give consent to sexual activity,"" the report said.

213,Exiled Guatemalan who started Florida refugee nonprofit dies,"Gaspar gained a prominent role in helping many Guatemalan families adapt to a new life in Florida during and after their country's brutal armed conflict.

MIAMI — Policarpia Gaspar, a Guatemalan civil war exile who co-founded a Florida organization mentoring Indian refugee children and connecting pregnant women to doctors has died, her family said Wednesday. She was 53.

Her son, Glenn Mendez, said his mother had been battling leukemia for more than three years and died last week. She was buried Wednesday.

Gaspar gained a prominent role in helping many Guatemalan families adapt to a new life in Florida during and after their country's brutal armed conflict. She continued to speak her native Maya language and dress in traditional indigenous garb.

""She was all about helping Guatemalans transition properly into the U.S. culture and helping their kids to advance,"" said Mendez. ""But she wanted them to still maintain their heritage.""

Born to peasant farmers on Dec. 3, 1965, in the village of San Miguel Acatan, Gaspar and her family fled their country's hostilities in 1980, when the Guatemalan government was systematically destroying villages seeking to root out leftist guerrillas.

According to the United Nations, about 200,000 people were killed during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, which ended in 1996. The conflict forced thousands of Guatemalans to escape, and many exiles settled in Florida.

Gaspar attended high school in California, where her family originally arrived, before moving to Florida. She then graduated with an associate's degree from Palm Beach Community College, now known as Palm Beach State College.

Gaspar and a Catholic priest who ran the diocese immigration and refugee office in West Palm Beach founded the Guatemalan Maya-Center in nearby Lake Worth in 1992. Father Frank O'Loughlin had already worked with the petite Guatemalan woman assisting other refugees with immigration procedures in Indiantown, where many Guatemalans worked in the farm fields.

Growing up speaking the ancient language of Kanjobal, Gaspar would help translate information between immigrants and lawyers. She also drove pregnant women to doctor's visits, so they wound understand the medical orders.

The nonprofit has grown since its creation and now serves 1,000 families monthly. There are some 80,000 Guatemalans living in Florida, many of them are concentrated in Palm Beach County, home to Lake Worth.

Known as Polly, Gaspar and her husband Juan Mendez also began a Saturday mentoring program to help refugee children with little schooling and limited English.

Gaspar was known for wearing traditional long and loose tunics designed with vivid patterns of birds, flowers or geometrical shapes, known as huipiles.

""She was unapologetic. She was taken out of her country, but the country wasn't taken out of her,"" said her daughter Mallyn Mendez.

♪♪ SOLEDAD: WELCOME BACK TO THE NEARLY A CENTURY SINCE WINNING THE VOTE, WOMEN NOW VOTE AT HIGHER RATES THAN MEN. ACCORDING TO THE RUTGERS CENTER FOR AMERICAN WOMEN IN POLITICS, VOTER TURN OUT FOR WOMEN HAS OUT PACED MEN IN EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE 1980, AND THEY VOTED AT HIGHER RATES IN THE 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS AS WELL. ALL AGE GROUPS SAW A BOOST IN NUMBERS, BUT TURN OUT INCREASED THE MOST AMONG WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18-24. SHE IS A SENIOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, AND ALLISON IS A JUNIOR AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. NICE TO HAVE YOU. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF POLITICALLY? >> SURE. SO I AM A REGISTERED REPRESENT, BUT I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO DEFINE MYSELF AS MORE OF A MILLENNIAL DEFINITION OF THAT. I REMEMBER -- SOLEDAD: WHAT IS A MILLENNIAL DEFINITION OF A REGISTERED REPUBLICAN? >> THANK YOU FOR ASKING. I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SIGNED UP AS A REPRESENT, AND IT WAS ME AND MY FAMILY WHO WERE SITTING THERE IN OUR AUDITORIUM IN FLORIDA. WE WERE THINKING WE DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE DIRECTION THE REPRESENT PARTY IS GOING IN. BUT IF THERE IS ONE PERSON THAT CAN PUSH THE PARTY TO THE RIGHT, THEN THERE IS ONE THAT CAN PUSH IT MORE TOWARD THE LEFT, AS WE WANT TO SEE. SOLEDAD: ALLISON, YOU ARE A JUNIOR, YOU HAVE FOCUSED A LOT ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN. WHERE ARE YOU? >> I AM A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT. FEMALE DOMINATED HOME BY MY MOTHER, WHO IS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT WOMEN'S ADVOCACY, WOMEN'S WORK, IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT SHAPED MY IDEA OF WHAT IS FAIR, WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT WOMEN DESERVE. SOLEDAD: AND WHAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND? WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? >> I AM FROM STANFORD, CONNECTICUT. MY MOTHER IS FROM EAST COAST TEX. MY FATHER IS COLOMBIAN. IT IS DEFINITELY THE TWO NARRATIVES OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LATINO IN THE UNITED STATES. SOLEDAD: WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THE POLLS BUT DRIVE YOUR ENGAGEMENT? FOR EXAMPLE, A WOMAN THAN OUGHT PROCEEDINGS TICKET IN SOME COMPASS AT THIS TIME, PRESIDENT OR VICE PRESIDENT. INSPIRE YOU OR I WILL RELEVANT TO ME? HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? >> I WANT IT TO BE THE NORM. I THINK WRITING SO MANY ARTICLES ABOUT IT IS IMPORTANT. BUT I HOPE THAT ONE DAY IT IS THE NORM, THAT IT IS NOT SHOCKING THAT 25% OF CONGRESS IS MADE UP OF WOMEN. >> I THINK STATISTICALLY WOMEN ARE JUST AS LIKELY, IF NOT MORE THAN MEN, TO WIN ELECTIONS. BUT IT IS ABOUT GETTING THE WOMEN IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RUN. ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS PEOPLE DON'T RUN, THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE THEM UP THERE. FOR ME IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO SEE A WOMAN BE AT THE TOP OF A CONTINGENT JUST BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION TO HAVE THAT CHANCE AND SAY I COULD DO THAT TOO ONE DAY. SOLEDAD: WHEN YOU THINK THAT WE ABOUT THIS HISTORY? HOW DO YOU VIEW IT? >> IT SPEAKS TO WHAT OUR NATION IS. WOMEN WHO IS SUCCESSED IN WHAT THEY EP INTENDED TO DO. BUT IT IS A CHANCE TO REFLECT ON HOW WE CAN DO BETTER. THAT IS WHAT GETS LOST IN A LOT OF THE MILLENNIAL CONVERSATION. WE ARE ANGRY AND WE WANT TO RADICALIZE THE SYSTEM. WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE WE CAN DO BETTER AND TAKE THESE STRONG WOMEN'S IDEAS AND OPINIONS WITH US FORWARD AND MOLD THEM INTO SOMETHING MORE INCREDIBLE FOR OUR FUTURE. >> FOR ME THE 19TH AMENDMENT WAS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S EVERYTHING. ANY SORT OF POLITICAL ACTIVISM COMES DOWN TO THAT MOMENT.

228,Pit bull euthanized after shelter volunteer's death,"Workers euthanized the pit bull mix involved in an attack that left a Humane Society volunteer dead.

Authorities on Thursday afternoon responded to a report of a dog bite at the Humane Society of St. Lucie County's Second Chance Shelter in Fort Pierce.



Police found Christine Liquori dead in the play area. The medical examiner said Friday she bled to death.

The Humane Society told CBS12 News there were no witnesses to the attack and it's not known how long she was in the play area before someone found her.

The shelter called Liquori a ""valued volunteer"" who worked with friends at Paws Fur Recovery.

The woman's death is under investigation by Fort Pierce Police.

230,"Puppy found badly burned, tossed in trash in Coachella","(CNN/WFLA) - Another horrific case of animal abuse surfaced over the weekend in Coachella, California.

NBC Palm Springs reports a woman found a 2-week-old puppy that had been badly burned and thrown in the trash.

“It was so horrible…sorry,"" Alexandra Zazueta recalled. “Her belly was stuck to a plastic bag and she cried a lot when I was trying to remove her from the plastic bag.”

Zazueta said the puppy smelled like it was rotting and its skin was falling off.

""I visibly saw lacerations down from her mid back all the way to her back legs. Her tail was cut, so her skin flap was just hanging off of her tail,"" she recalled. ""My mom was like you know what. Like maybe she'll pass away. And I was like no we can't give up. But if it happens she's not going to die in a box or in a bag like if she was trash. So (inaudible).""

""The puppy was tossed into this dumpster left to die rotting inside in over 100-degree temperatures. Now the question becomes why does this keep happening?"" said Luzdelia Caballero.

The incident comes weeks after Deborah Caldwell, 53, was seen tossing seven puppies in a dumpster in the same town. She was charged with seven felony counts of injuring the 3-day-old puppies and seven misdemeanor counts of abandoning them. She could face a maximum of seven years in prison.

""As much as we are shocked and then of course saddened to see the penalties not maybe as stiff as everyone would like to see, it's just that's the reality in California,"" said a man interviewed by the station. ""There are a lot of people harming humans and have been convicted and then released. So it's our world.""

The puppy is recovering at a clinic and is said to be on the up and up. It already has a new name and a home.

“Yes, Hope has a home and she has four other dogs waiting for her. And we are so happy and can’t wait to bring her home.”",https://www.wfla.com/national/puppy-found-badly-burned-tossed-in-trash/1994299047,2019-05-10T12:41:14Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

233,Community baby shower in Immokalee offers support to expectant moms,"Marie O. Jean is expecting her first child, a baby girl she can't wait to dress up and do girly things with.

She considers it a gift being able to have a baby, especially because she knows women who have wanted to but whose bodies couldn’t.

Jean, 25, has a way with children. She has worked with kids in one form or another since she was a teenager and is currently a tutor at the Boys & Girls Club in Immokalee.

“Kids have always been exciting for me,” Jean said.

While she’s eager to welcome her little girl this summer, she realized she had some unexpected things to learn about motherhood.

Jean and more than 30 other expectant mothers attended the 4th annual community baby shower at the Immokalee Boys & Girls Club on Thursday. They received information from more than a dozen organizations offering various social services and resources to moms in Immokalee.

The community baby shower, organized through a partnership between the Florida State University Center for Child Stress and Health in Immokalee and Healthy Start of Southwest Florida, is offered to low-income women and migrant workers, many of whom receive medical services through the Healthcare Network of Southwest Florida and mental health services from the FSU clinic.

“The main goal is to provide education and information for moms,” said Rosa Martinez, the event organizer and outreach coordinator for the FSU center. “And some of these women will never have a baby shower of their own.”

The moms got to pick out clothes for their children and left the baby shower with essentials and gifts — diapers, baby wipes, teething rings, toys, Pack 'n Plays, strollers, car seats, medical kits. A few women left with bigger raffle items like a rocking chair and a crib.

A certified car seat technician from Golisano Children’s Hospital of Southwest Florida taught the parents about child passenger safety and stressed the importance of correctly installing car seats to protect children during crashes.

Dr. Adriana Ziemba with the Healthcare Network of Southwest Florida talked to the women in Spanish and English about the importance of self-care during and after their pregnancies.

She encouraged them to exercise, dance, play music, talk to friends and family, take walks, watch funny videos online or any other activity that could help ease the stresses of motherhood.

She emphasized the importance of taking care of not just their bodies, but their minds. Ziemba talked about some of the psychological symptoms women can experience during and after childbirth — sadness, crying, irritability, anger, frustration. She talked to them about postpartum depression and implored them to get help if they experienced serious psychological symptoms for too long. She told them suicidal thoughts are an emergency.

“We don’t want you to suffer in silence,” Ziemba told the women. “ ... Self-care also means getting help and asking for help.”

Jean said she didn’t know about car seat safety. She also didn’t know about postpartum depression.

She said her pregnancy has been healthy and relatively symptom-free. She has a good support system with her group of friends and family. She turns to them or does research when she’s uncertain about something or when she doesn’t feel well. She said she would seek help if she experiences symptoms of postpartum depression now that she knows about it.

For right now, Jean, a cosmetologist, awaits the July arrival of her baby girl and dreams about owning a beauty salon.

She can’t wait for her “little mini-me” to be at her side when that dream becomes a reality.

Visitors also can hunt a skunk ape and take photos of a headless dinosaur. Here is a list of unique places and attractions worth checking out in Florida. MAUREEN KENYON/TCPALM Wochit

The wacky, weird and wild world of Florida Man is getting its own show.

Oxygen Media, which announced in 2017 a full-time shift to true crime-related television, revealed Tuesday that a series based on ""America's most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State,"" has been added to the channel's projects.

There is no start date for the show, however, the series will be developed by Blumhouse Productions and Man vs. Robot. Blumhouse, founded by Jason Blum, an Academy Award nominee and Emmy Award winner, is known for producing low-budget horror films ""Get Out,"" ""The Purge"" and ""Insidious.""

Oxygen Media announced Tuesday a series called ""Florida Man,"" based on ""America's most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State,"" will be developed for the true-crime channel. (Photo: Vladone, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Officials at Oxygen say the series, with the working title of ""Florida Man,"" will focus on ""America’s most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State and will unravel the strange twists and turns and try in vain to reason how and why this breed of killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension.""

A description of the show reads: ""When the murder is so bizarre, the motive so far-fetched and the crime so outlandish that it sounds like something from a Hollywood screenplay, there’s a good chance it was actually committed by a ‘Florida Man.’ ""

Yep. Sounds about right.

Other true crime shows in development at Oxygen include “The DNA of Murder;” “The Lover’s Lane Murders;” “Exploited;” “Framed by the Killer;” and “The Jane Doe Murders.”

The true-crime channel in 2018 was the fastest growing network in basic cable for the second consecutive year, according to Oxygen.

In March, users on social media got a kick out of Googling ""Florida Man"" with their birthday, which generated a Florida Man story that occurred on or near that day.

For example, Googling ""Florida Man September 14,"" which is Gov. Ron DeSantis' birthday — by default he's Florida Man because he leads the Sunshine State — this wacky story is generated: ""Shirtless Florida man is back to take on Hurricane Florence because the internet made it so.""

242,Woman creates bulletproof hoodies for all ages due to widespread shootings,"EAST PALO ALTO, Calif. - A woman whose neighbor was shot and killed in an attempted robbery has started a company that makes bulletproof hoodies to keep people of all ages safe.

The California company, Wonder Hoodie, produces the bulletproof protection in smaller sizes for young children and teens after the rash of school shootings in the U.S.

Vy Tran, 25, says she came up with the idea after her neighbor was killed in front of their home and she couldn't find protective gear for her mother or brother.

Wonder Hoodie products meet the requirements for body armor by the National Institute of Justice. The company also sells bulletproof jean jackets, vests and other accessories, reports KTRK.

All of the company's bulletproof products can protect people from weapons such as a .44 magnum.

""We only use dupont kevlar and a newer version of their kevlar, called kevlar xp,"" said Tran. ""They're rated as 3A, which is the highest level of protection you can get from soft body armor.""

Tran says one man bought a hoodie for his wife, who is a teacher. Another customer bought one to feel safe to go to the movies.

245,Cyberstalking of alleged battery victim lands Rockledge man back in jail,"CLOSE And it can happen to anyone Lamaur Stancil

ROCKLEDGE — A judge has revoked the bail of the Rockledge man accused of torturing a woman and keeping her trapped in a dog crate.

One year ago, the Rockledge Public Safety Department charged Robert Carilli, 38, of the 900 block of Cardon Drive, with five crimes based on the woman's recount of her time being trapped. He spent a few weeks at the Brevard County Jail, then posted $60,000 bail.

The bail revocation hearing happened April 23. Carilli remained at the jail Tuesday without bail.

Previous story: Rockledge man accused of sadistic acts against woman

One of the conditions of his release was Carilli could not contact the woman. But the State Attorney's Office said that happened several times last summer, despite the woman leaving Florida, getting a new phone number and making adjustments to her social media accounts.

She had unknowingly connected with Carilli on Facebook when he created a fake profile impersonating another woman she knew, according to the police report. She told police he likely got her new cell number from her Facebook profile as well and began sending text messages. Despite blocking his number, Carilli used other phone lines to continue texting her, police said.

One message sent to the woman included a map attachment featuring her new home.

In September, prosecutors filed a motion to revoke Carilli's bail. The 33-year-old woman who said she was Carilli's captive asked that she be able to testify remotely because she had moved out of state and wouldn't be able to leave work to travel. That request required its own motion and hearing separate from the bond revocation hearing.

""Due to the overall context of this case, to include the overall allegations of prior sadomasochistic sexual abuse perpetuated by the defendant, it would be unduly and extraordinarily traumatic for (her) to appear in the actual physical presence of the defendant at this time,"" Assistant State Attorney Michael Doyle wrote in the motion to allow her to testify via Skype.

The woman said she will testify in person at trial, Doyle said.

A judge granted the Skype request in December. A date for the bail hearing was set for March 1, then rescheduled for April 23.

Carilli is charged with two counts of aggravated battery and charges of false imprisonment, domestic violence and domestic battery by strangulation. Rockledge investigators said Carilli spent months torturing the woman and treating her as a slave.

Carilli's next court appearance is scheduled for June 19. He will remain at the jail until his case is resolved, according to a court order.

246,Florida woman pulls gator from pants during traffic stop,"""Not to be outdone by #FloridaMan, a #FloridaWoman pulled an alligator out of her pants,"" The Charlotte County Sheriff's Office tweeted.

PUNTA GORDA — Sheriff's officials say a Florida woman pulled a small alligator from her yoga pants during a traffic stop.

The Charlotte County sheriff's deputy stopped a pickup truck Monday afternoon after it ran a stop sign and 22-year-old driver Michael Clemons told him he and his 25-year-old passenger Ariel Machan-Le Quire were collecting frogs and snakes under an overpass. He gave the deputy permission to search bags in the truck.

When the deputy found 41 3-stripe turtles in the woman's backpack, he asked if she had anything else. She pulled the 1-foot alligator from her yoga pants.

Charlotte County Sheriff's officials suggested an explanation on Twitter for the incident: ""Not to be outdone by #FloridaMan, a #FloridaWoman pulled an alligator out of her pants.""

248,Florida woman pulls gator out of her pants during traffic stop,"CHARLOTTE COUNTY, Fla. - A Florida woman has some explaining to do after she pulled a live alligator out of her pants during a traffic stop, authorities said.

On Monday afternoon, the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office posted an image of the gator on Facebook, saying the unnamed woman was pulled over for unspecified reasons earlier in the day.

""Do you have anything else?"" deputies asked the woman at one point, according to the post. To which she replied by retrieving the scaly critter from her trowsers because we're in Florida.

It turns out the woman also had 41 three-striped mud turtles in her vehicle. As a result, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has taken over the investigation.

(Photo: MALCOLM DENEMARK/FLORIDA TODAY)

Spotting a cute, young woman headed to the ATM machine, Jaden McCart never thought he'd be changing the meaning of ""grocery store checkout line.""

""I came in shopping for groceries but I didn't know I was going to find a wife,"" said Jaden, recalling that day 20 years ago at the Melbourne Beach Publix. ""The minute I laid my eyes on her ...""

Cristle was 15 heading to Sebastian River High; Jaden was 16 at Melbourne High. Somehow, love found its way among the asparagus, yogurt and soda pop.

Recently, the Indialantic couple celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary by eating baked goods for lunch in Cristle's classroom at Gemini Elementary in Melbourne Beach. She teaches first grade in the same room where shelearned her ABCs.

Now the mother of four is ready to spend Mother's Day with her all-American family, which includes 10-year-old twin surfers, Beckham and Daya, who already are stirring waves.

A model family? Perhaps.

""We definitely make mistakes, like we all do; we have to grow from those mistakes,"" Cristle said. ""Being with someone for so long, through teenagers, we've relied on our faith in God and really working hard to get where we are today.""

Jaden, 36, co-owner of McCart Insurance in Palm Bay, said: ""She's the type of mom that puts her kids and family 100 percent first ... she's very passionate.""

Their eldest daughter, Reese, 15, plays soccer and lacrosse at Melbourne Central Catholic, while her baby brother, 2-year-old Aris, is a bundle of fun playing in the sand at the beach.

But it's the twin surfing sensations, Beckham and his sister Daya, who have gotten plenty of notice lately.

Surfers get 'twin inspiration'

Toes in the sand, Cristle kept a close eye on her kids during the recent Eastern Surfing Association Regional contest at Paradise Beach in Indialantic, where Beckham and Daya were competing in the finals.

The fraternal twins, who often surf up in age class, have collected so many trophies that their father donates many of them back to the Gnarly Charley Surf Series, ""where we all started.""

Recently, Beckham took second place in two divisions at the National Scholastic Surfing Association East Coast Championships in New Smyrna Beach and placed third in the 12-under division at the ESA event.

Daya claimed double first places in the 12s and 14s for the entire season of ESA, won the 12-under NSSA, Open 10-under title and reached the 12-under ESA Regional finals.

They'll head to California for the nationals in June at Huntington Beach.

So, who's the better surfer?

""Me,"" Daya quickly said. ""I have a better backside (surfing maneuver) and I am stronger.""

""No. no, no, don't write that down,"" Beckham said, pointing at his chest. ""Me, me, me.""

The twins already have collected an assortment of sponsors, including world-famous Billabong clothing, a deal struck with the help of local company rep Scott Bouchard, a surfing star during his heyday.

""They're adorable; they wear the clothing and look good in it,"" Cristle said.

Posters, marquees, ads ... ""hopefully, one day,"" she said.

""There's a Beckham in soccer, there's one in football, and now one in surfing,"" she said, laughing.

The twins were 3 years old when they first hopped on their dad's surfboard wanting to learn.

Jaden happens to be an accomplished surfer, who caught waves coast to coast as a youngster and remains among the top amateurs, winning the 2019 NSSA and ESA season crowns and is ranked second on the East Coast. His brother, Rylan, competed for years on the World Qualifying Series and now is the area director for Trinity Fitness Centers.

The twins also train with surfing legend John Holeman.

And mom? ""I sit on the beach and look pretty,"" she said. ""But I do love the ocean.""

Beckham has gotten to surf with 11-time world champion Kelly Slater of Cocoa Beach, and he and his sister have gotten some ""twin inspiration"" when the world's most famous surfing twins, C.J. and Damien Hobgood of Satellite Beach, spent a day at their house watching an NBA game.

""Their dad's a classic (surfer), I grew up surfing with him,"" said C.J., the 2001 world champion who has surfed with Beckham at Sebastian Inlet. ""The twins are so funny and they rip, too. That would be so cool for them both to make the tour, one on the female side and one on the men's.""

Before that, though, there's reading, writing and arithmetic.

Beckham and Daya ride their bikes together to school and are in the same fourth-grade class at Indialantic Elementary. ""We got each other's backs,"" Daya said.

While they share common traits, there are a couple of differences between the twins, who have even tricked their mom by dressing as each other.

""We're different,"" Beckham said. ""My sister likes avocados and ... what are those red things called? Tomatoes! I don't like those.""

Their only confrontation comes when they get back from the beach.

""Who gets in the hot shower first,"" Beckham said.

Pregnancy scare for mom

Cristle's pregnancy with the twins was a challenge for her and Jaden.

""I knew I was pregnant, but three months in, I got really sick,"" she said.

""I had a full OB exam, and they discovered that Beckham was hiding behind Daya in my womb, since twins share the same sac. So I knew I was having twins.""

Her illness forced her to lie in a hospital bed at Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne, where Dr. Wesley Foster monitored her preeclampsia complications and blood pressure, which ""was way too high.""

""Sure enough, the twins arrived happy and healthy. And they're still giving me high blood pressure,"" Cristle said jokingly.

During those three months, Jaden naturally had to limit his surfing.

""I was like a single parent (with Reese, then 5),"" Jaden said. ""I never had to operate without (Cristle). I was definitely worried about her health and the babies' health. I had to adapt. Luckily, my parents live in Melbourne Beach and Cristle's parents live in Grant, and both were a great help. Cristle's mom is a great cook.""

Cristle said she was concerned, as well.

""I kind of am the one that does everything, cooks, does mainly all the stuff,"" she said. ""But he's really good with kids and this pretty much prepared him for our life today. With four kids, we have a lot going on, a lot of activities. I'm not here all the time, so it was a good learning experience.

""A lot of prayer and faith got us through.""

Mother's Day is always special for the McCarts. A trip to mom's, dinner at a seafood restaurant with the family.

And who knows? Maybe a trip to the grocery store. Just to bring back some memories.

259,"How 'bizarre': Stolen police car chases stolen Cadillac, which then wrecks a home, police say","CLOSE A stolen Orange County Sheriff's Office vehicle was involved in a chase that caused another vehicle to hit a Cocoa home May 9, 2019. 911 TAPE CONTRIBUTED BY COCOA POLICE DEPARTMENT

Investigators from three agencies were working to unravel who stole an Orange County sheriff’s deputy’s patrol vehicle and used it to chase several cars Wednesday night before one of the vehicles being pursued – a stolen Cadillac – rammed a garage in a Cocoa neighborhood.

Authorities were mum on the circumstances leading up to the deputy’s vehicle being stolen from a Rockledge home or the deputy’s identity but said the stolen patrol vehicle apparently attempted to pull over other vehicles before the Cadillac plowed into the Cocoa residence.

No arrests have been made in the case and it was not immediately clear if any suspects had been identified.

“It’s very bizarre,” said Yvonne Martinez, spokeswoman for the Cocoa Police Department, the agency that responded to call initially.

At 1:41 a.m., Cocoa police were told about a hit-and-run crash in the 1100 block of Greenwood Way. A caller to 9-1-1 alerted dispatchers with information that it appeared that a police vehicle was involved with chasing the black Cadillac.

“A police was chasing someone…the car is a black Cadillac…it just went through a house,” the caller told a dispatcher. The Orange County patrol vehicle, a marked white SUV, had its lights activated and appeared to be pursuing the Cadillac at the time of the crash, witnesses told the police.

Officers arrived within moments and the black Cadillac – reported stolen out of West Palm Beach – sitting in a wrecked garage. Several parked vehicles were also hit in the area of Japonica Lane, Martinez said. The Brevard County sheriff’s helicopter was alerted along with surrounding agencies. A search then got underway for the patrol vehicle and suspects who ran off from the wrecked Cadillac.

As officers investigated the crash scene at the home, another Cocoa police officer spotted the Orange County patrol vehicle with its lights on attempting to pull over a black Nissan on Fiske Boulevard, Martinez said.

“Apparently, the occupant or occupants of this stolen patrol vehicle were going around pulling people over and getting into pursuits. We don’t know when the patrol car was stolen. But as a result of this crash on Greenwood Way, it caused this whole thing to unravel,” Martinez said.

The patrol vehicle was later found about 3:30 a.m. abandoned behind the Save-A-Lot shopping plaza on Dixon Boulevard in Cocoa.

Police were not sure if the suspect or suspect in the stolen Cadillac knew the person in the stolen patrol vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the patrol vehicle had been stolen in Rockledge.

Rockledge police talked to the deputy and turned the patrol vehicle over to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office for further processing. It was not immediately known if Orange County was conducting an administrative review of the incident. The suspect could face charges of impersonating a police officer.

There were no injuries reported during the crime spree, Martinez said.

Rockledge Deputy Chief Donna Seyferth said an investigation was ongoing into how the vehicle was stolen.

“We’re working this case like any other stolen vehicle case,” Seyferth said.

Anyone who encountered the stolen patrol vehicle or has additional information should call the Central Florida Crimeline at 1-800-423-TIPS (8477).

No arrests have been made in the case and it was not immediately clear if any suspects had been identified.

“It’s very bizarre,” said Yvonne Martinez, spokeswoman for the Cocoa Police Department, the agency that responded to call initially.

At 1:41 a.m., Cocoa police were told about a hit-and-run crash in the 1100 block of Greenwood Way. A caller to 9-1-1 alerted dispatchers with information that it appeared that a police vehicle was involved with chasing the black Cadillac.

“A police was chasing someone…the car is a black Cadillac…it just went through a house,” the caller told a dispatcher. The Orange County patrol vehicle, a marked white SUV, had its lights activated and appeared to be pursuing the Cadillac at the time of the crash, witnesses told the police.

Officers arrived within moments and the black Cadillac – reported stolen out of West Palm Beach – sitting in a wrecked garage. Several parked vehicles were also hit in the area of Japonica Lane, Martinez said. The Brevard County sheriff’s helicopter was alerted along with surrounding agencies. A search then got underway for the patrol vehicle and suspects who ran off from the wrecked Cadillac.

As officers investigated the crash scene at the home, another Cocoa police officer spotted the Orange County patrol vehicle with its lights on attempting to pull over a black Nissan on Fiske Boulevard, Martinez said.

“Apparently, the occupant or occupants of this stolen patrol vehicle were going around pulling people over and getting into pursuits. We don’t know when the patrol car was stolen. But as a result of this crash on Greenwood Way, it caused this whole thing to unravel,” Martinez said.

The patrol vehicle was later found about 3:30 a.m. abandoned behind the Save-A-Lot shopping plaza on Dixon Boulevard in Cocoa.

Police were not sure if the suspect or suspect in the stolen Cadillac knew the person in the stolen patrol vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the patrol vehicle had been stolen in Rockledge.

Rockledge police talked to the deputy and turned the patrol vehicle over to the Orange County sheriff’s office for further processing. It was not immediately known if Orange County was conducting an administrative review of the incident. The suspect could face charges of impersonating a police officer.

There were no injuries reported during the crime spree, Martinez said.

Rockledge Deputy Chief Donna Seyferth said an investigation was ongoing into how the vehicle was stolen.

“We’re working this case like any other stolen vehicle case,” Seyferth said.

Anyone who encountered the stolen patrol vehicle or has additional information should call the Central Florida Crimeline at 1-800-423-TIPS (8477).

262,Alleged Pasco child predator faced similar accusations more than 10 years ago,"8 On Your Side Investigates has uncovered new information about an accused child sex predator from Pasco County.

Since February, Joseph Anthony Ponchot, 49, has been in custody for various alleged crimes including possessing and transmitting child pornography, promoting sexual performance by a child and sexual battery. 8 On Your Side has learned that more than 10 years ago, Ponchot was accused of sexually abusing another child in Zephyrhills. That case went nowhere.

Records show that the 49-year-old was arrested after alleged pornographic files were flagged online in February.

8 On Your Side spoke with a woman who says her son was one of Ponchot's victims.

We are not releasing her identity in order to protect the child's privacy.

""My son was friends with his son,"" said the woman.

According to a Pasco County arrest report dated Feb. 11, Ponchot admitted to having child pornography and also producing it.

Deputies continued their investigation after the 49-year-old was booked. Additional charges were added twice in February and once in April.

According to a Pasco County arrest report dated April 17, Ponchot raped a 12-year-old boy and filmed the incident.

Detectives also state they've found more than 1,200 photos and videos of child pornography.

8 On Your Side continued to dig through documents released by the Zephyrhills Police Department.

We discovered that in November of 2008, another mother contacted police. The woman's son also claimed he had been sexually abused by Ponchot.

According to the paperwork, the child said it had happened ""numerous times when they lived with Mr. Ponchot.""

The State Attorney's Office declined to prosecute the case, according to Zephyrhills police.

In December of 2013, there was another case.

Police received an anonymous tip about a suspicious comment online. The person thought Ponchot was having a relationship with a child.

According to police documents, Zephyrhills detectives investigated and found the complaint to be baseless.

This story mirrors that of another accused child sex predator that 8 On Your Side has been tracking.

Manuel McGhee is a former decorated veteran. According to the Winter Haven Police Department, he slipped through the cracks for at least 13 years.

Right now, both men are in custody.

We will continue to follow this developing story.",http://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/investigations/alleged-pasco-child-predator-faced-similar-accusations-more-than-10-years-ago/1990401655,2019-05-08T22:28:11Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
263,"'Hundreds of bugs' in child's backpack, poor hygiene, leads to Bagdad mom's arrest","A Milton woman was arrested last week after her children’s poor hygiene at school prompted a Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office inquiry into their home life, which discovered living conditions deemed unfit for children.

Jessica Stevenson, 33, was arrested May 3 and charged with child neglect without causing great bodily harm. She was given a bond of $12,500.

According to her arrest report, a Bagdad Elementary School staff member made a Florida Department of Children and Families report concerning three siblings who attended the elementary school.

Based on that DCF report, the Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office opened an investigation into the living conditions of the students on April 18, the arrest report stated.

The employee said she’d noticed a second-grade student wearing the same clothing for an entire week in April and that the child’s body odor was hard to ignore, the report stated.

The employee questioned the second-grader as to when their last bath had been, the report stated. The student replied they did not know.

The employee said she provided the student with a new pair of clothing and took the old outfit. The old clothes were “severely soiled” with dirt caked into the fabric, the report stated.

Additionally, the employee informed investigators that “hundreds of bugs crawled out” of the student’s “backpack in the lunchroom,” the report stated.

The second-grade student has four siblings, according to the arrest report. The five siblings are aged 5, 7, 11, 12 and 14 years old.

Three of the five children attended Bagdad Elementary School, the report stated.

Another teacher at Bagdad Elementary School told investigators that she’d met with the children’s caretaker, Jessica Stevenson. The teacher said Stevenson “immediately berated her after assuming it was her who called DCF,” the report stated.

The teacher said that she knew that one of the siblings had repeatedly been given new clothing by the school, the report stated.

Each new outfit would be worn continuously, day-after-after, until it was inevitably worn out, at which point, another new set of clothing would be provided by the school to the student, the report stated.

Additionally, the teacher said her student was frequently crying, “having meltdowns” and seemed depressed, the report stated.

When deputies visited the siblings’ residence they discovered a cockroach infestation. The report stated, “The roaches were on nearly every surface in the home” including “on the children’s mattress, in the pots and pans in the kitchen, and inside the cabinets/fridge.”

The cabinets were empty of food, and the refrigerator contained two cartons of rancid milk, spoiled eggs, some sugar and a stick of butter, the report stated. A plugged in microwave dangled out of a window by its cord.

Overall, the home was “filthy,” the report stated, except for Stevenson’s bedroom. Compared to the rest of the home, Stevenson’s bedroom was clean with minimal roaches and had a stashed bag of snacks.

Stevenson made bond the day after her arrest and was released from custody on May 4.

265,Tampa woman resorts to theft to get help for heroin addiction in jail,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

LARGO, Fla. (WFLA) - A Tampa woman told police she resorted to stealing from a Largo CVS and asked to go to jail because she is ""addicted to heroin and cannot get help anywhere else.""

A arrest report shows that on May 5, Michelle Hildebrandt, 32, walked into the CVS Pharmacy at 2390 East Bay Dr. and ripped open various food items, dumping them out on the floor. When Largo police officers arrived, Hildebrandt asked them to take her to jail.

The report goes on to say Hildebrandt made spontaneous statements admitting to her actions and said she wanted to go to jail due to her addiction.

Even though Hildebrandt lives in Tampa, her father, Mike Morris, told News Channel 8 his daughter specifically went to Pinellas County to commit her crime because she heard that particular jail was better for addicts behind bars.

A former addict now clean for 25 years, Morris said he didn't mind that his daughter broke the law in order to get clean.

""She knew she needed to be some place where she couldn't just leave,"" he said. ""I'm proud of her for having gone to those lengths to try and get help.""

He explained his daughter started using heroin about two years ago after getting hooked on pills a couple years before that. Morris added that it took Hildebrandt three shoplifting attempts on Sunday to even get caught, going to two stores prior to CVS.

He also explained his daughter has tried to get help before but gave up when the withdrawals got too bad. She also doesn't have the money or insurance to cover entering a rehab facility.

For the sake of his 5-year-old granddaughter, Morris hopes his daughter's most recent act of desperation is enough to get her clean.

""There's literally millions of people out there right now that need help, and want help, but they can't get it because they don't have any money,"" he said.

Hildebrandt has priors on her record including theft and prostitution.

268,Police: Ohio fugitive captured at St. Augustine homeless shelter,"ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. - A woman who had been on the run for months from authorities in Ohio was finally captured in St. Augustine, police said.

Jessica Glusic, 22, was a wanted woman after prosecutors in Ohio said she was indicted on one count of illegal sexual conduct involving a minor.

On Monday night, she was taken into custody by St. Augustine police when she showed up at a homeless shelter.

Every time a new homeless person shows up at a shelter, they can’t gain access until they have undergone a criminal background check. In this case, a background check is what led to Glusic getting caught.

Police said Glusic tried to get into St. Francis House, a homeless shelter in St. Augustine, without an ID. Because she didn’t have identification, police were called to conduct a background check to make sure she wasn’t a wanted suspect. Homeless people who interacted with her said she seemed to fit in.

""She seemed like a nice person. We clicked because of our ages. She told me she was pregnant and homeless and (was) trying to get it together,"" Chante King said.

But when police conducted a background check on her name, they said they discovered she was actually wanted fugitive from Ohio who was accused of having sex with a minor.

""It's unbelievable,"" King said.

""That’s pretty concerning,"" added Kaylin Walrath, who stays at St. Francis House.

According to court documents, a Youngstown, Ohio, grand jury indicted Glusic in February on a charge of illegal sexual conduct with a minor who was under the age of 16 but older than 13. Prosecutors told News4Jax that she had been on the run since she was indicted.

Several homeless people who recognized Glusic’s booking photo said she came down from Ohio with another woman and that both women were sitting right here when police arrived Monday.

""She was, like, 'Oh, my God,'"" said Dustin Warring, who stays at St. Francis House. ""They called her over there and her friend starts flipping. She was, like, 'I can’t be down here without her.'""

Glusic was immediately taken into custody on the warrant for her arrest.

She is being held without bond in the St. Johns County jail. There's no word when she will be extradited back to Ohio.

CHARLOTTE COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) – A Florida woman pulled an alligator out of her pants during a traffic stop in Charlotte County Monday morning.

The Charlotte County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post that the woman removed the gator from her pants after being asked the standard “do you have anything else?”

The sheriff’s office said she also had 41 three-stripe turtles in the vehicle.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission responded to take over the investigation.

276,"Action 9 helped two local families recover $22,000","0 Action 9 helped two local families recover $22,000

ORLANDO, Fla. - Action 9 helped two local families recover $22,000.

Just days after buying a puppy, a Rockledge woman found out it was not fit to sell, and the dog could not be saved.

“She's licking your face and I feel, I'm about to kill her and I love her,” Allison Navigato said.

Navigato had to euthanize her silver lab puppy days after buying it from Petland in Waterford Lakes.

Then she said the store refused to cover most of her losses, which included more than $6,000 to buy the puppy and vet bills.

Navigato contacted Action 9.

“You guys let others know what's going on. You raised attention to it,” Navigato said.

Todd Ulrich’s investigation found similar complaints were sent to the Better Business Bureau and Florida's Attorney General.

Two weeks after Action 9’s story aired, Petland sent the couple a $6,400 check. That was all they were asking for.

“It's not like they're giving us extra money, they're just making us whole again,” Navigato said.

Action 9 also helped a Palm Bay with a contractor issue.

Rafael Del Toro said he has a lot of damage on his roof. 17 months after Hurricane Irma, he can finally get a new roof.

But not from the company he first hired to do the job.

Del Toro paid Armadillo Roofing in Melbourne nearly $17,000 as a deposit for a new metal roof.

Weeks then months passed, and nothing happened.

“Then I started making phone calls. Hey, where is my roof?” Del Toro said.

He said they kept promising that he was next. After waiting for seven months he turned to Action 9.

“I said, I need help and that's when I decided to give your organization a call,” Del Toro said.

Action 9 found Armadillo Roofing had similar BBB complaints involving deposits for work not done.

Ulrich contacted company managers about Del Toro’s missing deposit. About a month later, he picked up refund checks for nearly $17,000.

“I'm glad you guys are listening to a small little voice in the wilderness,” Del Toro said.

Armadillo Roofing did not say what caused months in delays.

With any new roof contract, pay a minimal deposit, and try to include a completion date in the contract.

279,"Naples Zoo celebrates 50th year as a zoo, 100th year as a garden","In Naples, 100th birthdays aren't necessarily uncommon, but they're none the less a cause for celebration, which is exactly what the Naples Zoo is doing as it marks its 100th year as a botanical garden and 50th year as a zoo.

The zoo is hosting a birthday party Saturday for Dr. Henry Nehrling, the man without whom the zoo might not exist today.

Two men with a vision (and green thumbs)

Nehrling, a botanist from Wisconsin, moved to Central Florida in the early 1900s to study and collect tropical plants. A freeze devastated his garden in 1917, so in 1919 he moved further south to Naples and purchased 13 acres along the Gordon River.

The tree was planted sometime between 1919 and 1929 when the garden was owned by conservationist Dr. Henry Nehrling. This year the Naples Zoo is celebrating 100 years as a botanical garden and 50 years as a zoo. (Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

His work thrived there and by 1925 Nehrling's collection had more than 3,000 species of tropical plants. He also helped introduce more than 300 new and beneficial plants to the United States.

More: Naples Zoo makes TripAdvisor's Hall of Fame

Nehrling died in 1929 and for the next two decades his garden went unattended, said Tim Tetzlaff, the zoo's director of conservation.

""Basically nobody was keeping watch, nobody was paying attention, so there was a fair amount of botanical vandalism and stealing. Things that were either small enough or still in pots at the time kind of vanished,"" he said. ""That’s why we’ve got dozens of historic specimens, not thousands from that era.""

Julius Fleischmann, Jr., a philanthropist from Cincinnati, came to town in 1946 ""with his checkbook and a vision,"" Tetzlaff said. He bought Nehrling's property in 1951 and not only restored the garden to its former glory, but also expanded it.

""He added 30 more acres and also hundreds of species of birds,"" said Elaine Reed, president of Naples Historical Society. ""At one point he actually had 1,200 different species of birds.""

Fleischmann renamed the property ""Caribbean Gardens,"" a name it still bears today, and opened it to guests in 1954. Three years later he installed the famed toucan sign on U.S. 41 that welcomed visitors to the garden a few blocks away on Goodlette-Frank Road.

Fleischmann owned and operated the property until his death in 1968. A year later, the land fell into a new set of hands that would once again transform it forever.

Lawrence and Nancy Jane Tetzlaff, better known as Jungle Larry and Safari Jane, were well-known expedition leaders and zoo operators in the Midwest.

The couple visited Naples in 1967 and fell in love with Caribbean Gardens. They inquired about purchasing the property, but Fleischmann refused to sell.

Shortly after Fleischmann's death, his son, who had inherited the property, offered to lease it to the Tetzlaffs and they immediately agreed.

Work began to incorporate the Tetzlaffs' animals into the garden while preserving as much of the botanical garden as possible.

""All the original animal exhibits were put in with the removal of just one tree,"" said Tim Tetzlaff, Larry and Jane's son. ""That way it maintained the nature of what was then a 50-year-old botanical garden.""

The Tetzlaffs owned and operated the zoo until 2002 when the Fleischmann family expressed an interest in selling the 43 acres of zoo property and the nearly 120 surrounding acres.

Knowing that a buyer would most likely bulldoze the area, the Tetzlaffs asked Collier County to buy the land. In a 2004 referendum, Collier County voters overwhelming agreed to tax themselves to buy the zoo from the Fleischmann family.

Preserving the past and looking to the future

Today the zoo's staff is working to preserve the property's history and ensure that it will be around for the next 100 years.

""The most unique thing about this property is this is as close as you could get to what Naples would have looked like a long time ago,"" said Danielle Green, the zoo's director of gardens and grounds.

""I think it’s very unique in this day and age, no matter where you are in the country, that you’re able to go and visit a place on a regular basis and see plants that your great-great-grandmother would have seen at the time. I think that’s really special.""

Making a Difference: Naples Zoo striving to be a conservation leader

Green and her team care for the hundreds of plants and trees on the property, including eight Nehrling and 11 Fleischmann historic tree specimens.

“Older specimens require a little additional care, no different than that of humans or animals, so we try to pay special attention to them versus some of the younger ones,"" Green said.

Sometimes that additional care means injecting pesticides directly into the tree, said Darryl Windham, the zoo's horticultural manager.

“Some of these trees are so large when you’re trying to do pest control or even fertilizer you can’t just spray the trees,"" he said. ""It’s just not feasible and very impractical to do that.""

In addition to preserving the property's history, the zoo is also working on expansion plans.

The Naples Zoo launched a $25 million fundraising campaign in 2016 to add a flamingo/roseate spoonbill exhibit, Alligator Bay feature, Komodo dragon exhibit, South American rain forest and grasslands trail, nature and water play area for children, and education center, which will be used to host camps and programs for students from Collier and Lee counties and night lectures for adults.

The zoo is also adding a new on-site animal hospital set to be complete in July, a welcome center and a revamped entrance that will remind visitors of the zoo's long history.

“The new entrance has an Old Florida theme, so it will recreate the entrance sign that was on U.S. 41 for all those years with the big toucan we have preserved,"" Tetzlaff said. ""So we’re connecting people with the past, but also with everything that’s new inside.""

280,Immigrant's attorneys want charges dropped after Nassau deputy's death,"NASSAU COUNTY, Fla. - Attorneys for an illegal immigrant who was running from a Nassau County deputy when the deputy was hit and killed while crossing a busy road have asked a judge to dismiss criminal charges that stemmed from the deputy's death.

Investigators said Deputy Eric Oliver was hit and killed by a car in 2016 while chasing Francisco Portillo-Fuentes across A1A in Yulee. Lawyers for Portillo-Fuentes are asking a judge to dismiss their client's charges of felony murder and aggravated manslaughter.

Defense attorneys have zeroed in on three concerns in the hopes of getting the case dropped. They claim that a federal agent involved in the case lied, that Oliver flouted traffic laws and that the driver who struck Oliver was driving carelessly.

In the motion, attorneys wrote: ""A series of unfortunate events and the State is now attempting to blame Mr. Fuentes for those misfortunes by prosecuting him.""

According to the defense, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent escalated a benign situation into a dangerous one, and ""fabricated testimony"" to the grand jury that returned the indictment. The agent said he noticed the men acting nervously when they spotted the deputies, and that's when the agent approached them, asking deputies to back him up.

The defense claims surveillance video from an adjacent car wash shows that Oliver and another deputy were not at the Gate gas station when the agent said they were. The agent went to the pickup truck and three of the men admitted they were illegal immigrants.

The agent started to handcuff three of them, and that's when Portillo-Fuentes ran, according to defense attorneys. Oliver and another deputy started chasing Portillo-Fuentes, and Oliver was killed when he ran into traffic on A1A.

Defense lawyers claim neither Oliver nor the federal agent knew Portillo-Fuentes, and that the agent admitted in his deposition the men at the Gate weren't doing anything wrong. Portillo-Fuentes told prosecutors he knew he was going to be arrested, which they contend made him a fleeing felon.

The motion argued that ""the agent fabricated his rationale for detaining and interrogating the subjects."" It said the agent lied multiple times and that Portillo-Fuentes could only be detained for an immigration check. It said he had not committed any crimes and was not going to be arrested.

The filing also raised concerns about Oliver's own actions, saying he ""lagged behind in his unjustified pursuit of Mr. Fuentes, did not see oncoming traffic and was found to be the cause of the accident.""

As for the woman driving the SUV that hit Oliver, the motion said, ""She was drinking tea at the time and was putting it back in the cup holder … She admitted that she may have glanced down for a moment to make sure she did not spill her tea.""

It continued, ""She did not see what she hit.""

Rick Sitka, Portillo-Fuentes' attorney, said he feels the arguments will hold up in court.

""The case law we cited supports that fact, and it's up to the judge to decide,"" he said. ""That is all i can comment at this time.""

Oliver's father did not wish to make a comment. News4Jax did not immediately receive a response from Nassau County Sheriff Bill Leeper.

285,Tired of seeing Nikki Fried's face on gas pumps? You may not be alone,"These ""inspected and approved for accuracy"" stickers affixed to gas pumps throughout the state prominently feature Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, much to the chagrin of some.

PEMBROKE PARK, Fla. - The Republican-controlled Florida Legislature is apparently done looking at Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried.

Fried, the lone Democrat in the Florida Cabinet, has affixed a picture of her face to gas pumps throughout the state.

Every time the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services conducts a gas pump inspection, a certification sticker is affixed to it. Unlike her Republican predecessor Adam Putnam, who used the department's logo instead of his photograph, Fried is using her portrait to put a face with the name.

Max Flugrath, a spokesman for Fried, told Local10.com in an email that the new decal is intended to ""drive consumer awareness and gain attention around our consumer fraud resources, and it seems to be working.""

But not everyone is happy about it.

Evan Power, chairman of the Leon County Republican Party in Tallahassee, took to Twitter to blast the decal, writing Tuesday that it ""looks like an election ad.""

Great to see this reporting. I can’t believe the AG Commissioner’s office thought it was ok to go with what looks like an election ad https://t.co/978wc3PKJF — Evan Power (@EvanPower) May 7, 2019

Fried's smiling face may have even been the driving force behind Section 92 of a budget-implementation bill that requires the stickers to have ""only a combination of lettering, numbering, words or the department logo.""

The implementation bill takes effect July 1, which could force Fried's office to swap out the stickers.

Flugrath said at least 84,000 decals ""and counting"" have already been placed on gas pumps throughout the state.

""We're reviewing the implementing language to see if any changes may be needed for future decal revisions,"" Flugrath said.

Fried, 41, is an attorney from Fort Lauderdale. She narrowly defeated Republican nominee Matt Caldwell in the November election and is the first woman elected to the position.

286,"DCPS officer, his stepfather face child sex charges involving same girl","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A police lieutenant with Duval County Public Schools who was arrested Tuesday is facing child sex charges for an incident involving a young girl, News4Jax has learned.

As if that wasn't disturbing enough, the Michigan Attorney General's Office said the man's stepfather is facing the same charges -- involving the same child.

Authorities did not release the child's exact age or her relationship to the two men.

Lt. Sean MacMaster, 45, is charged with two counts of criminal conduct with a child, which is a first-degree felony. He was taken into custody on the out-of-state arrest warrant at the Duval County School Police Department. He was set to go before a judge Wednesday afternoon.

MacMaster's stepfather, Larry Orr, who is a registered sex offender in Michigan, is facing the same charges. He was arraigned in Oakland County Superior Court on Thursday and is being held without bond.

A statement from a Duval County Public Schools spokesperson reads in part:

We have received notification that an employee with the Duval County School Police Department, Lt. Sean MacMaster, was arrested (Tuesday) morning on an out of state warrant. The charges are not related to the school district or any student in the district. However, the district is closely monitoring this situation. The individual is currently in custody. Should he be released from custody, he will not have any contact with students pending the outcome of an internal investigation.

It wasn't immediately clear which school MacMaster worked at.

A woman who was at the home of MacMaster's listed address told News4Jax, ""We don't have any comment.""

287,Inmates file class action lawsuit over Florida's use of solitary confinement,"Admire Harvard spent most of his adult life in solitary confinement at Florida State Prison.

Jac'Quann ""Admire"" Harvard, an inmate at Florida State Prison in Raiford, has filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Corrections over its solitary confinement policies (Photo: Florida Department of Corrections)

And now she is suing to get out of the men's prison.

Harvard and five other inmates, including a minor, are the plaintiffs in a federal class action lawsuit against the Department of Corrections brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Florida Legal Services and the Florida Justice Institute. The lawsuit, announced at a news conference today, challenges the department’s use of solitary confinement as cruel and unusual punishment.

“At any given time there are close to 10,000 people locked away in solitary confinement in Florida’s prison system for months, even years, in cells smaller than a parking space,” SPLC Senior Supervising Attorney Shalini Goel Agarwal said in a news release.

The lawsuit claims that FDC knows about the damaging effects of solitary confinement but has not done enough to fix them. While they are 3 percent of the prison population, they make up 40 percent of the people receiving mental health treatment, the lawsuit said.

Solitary confinement is increasingly recognized as torture by medical and mental health professionals, the organizations said. And while other states are taking steps to reduce or eliminate solitary, Florida is an outlier. It has more than double the national average of its prison population in solitary, about 10 percent.

Solitary increases the risk of suicide, they said. From January 2013 to August 2018, FDC reported 46 of 80 inmates who committed suicide were in isolation and another 24 had previously been in solitary. And more than 60 percent of those in solitary are black in a state where only 16 percent of the population is black.

""Racial disparities plague Florida's criminal justice system,"" Agarwal said.

Harvard, the 28-year-old transgender black woman whose birth name is Jac’Quann Harvard, began her sentence at Florida State Prison in July 2009. She was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, gender dysphoria and hypertension and placed in solitary by prison staff two months later. They allegedly accused her of lying to get a high-calorie meal in the dining hall after being in prison for two months, the complaint said.

“Within her first three months of isolation, Defendants found her guilty of nine new disciplinary infractions, adding an additional 270 days in isolation,” said the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Tallahassee. She was accused of fighting with a cellmate, yelling, kicking her door and disrespecting staff.

The prison prescribed her powerful mood stabilizers and anti-psychotic medications, noting that because of her mental illness she suffered from anxiety and impulsivity.

Over the last nine years she attempted suicide several times and suffers from depression, hallucinations and delusions, the complaint said. She was hospitalized more than 20 times for psychiatric reasons, and placed in a suicide watch cell more than 50 times. She cut or injured herself at least 40 times.

The prison cited her for 127 disciplinary infractions. “They have left her in a bare cell with nothing but her underwear for several days at a time as punishment,” the complaint said. She never received a personal visit, reading material other than religious texts, education or exercise outside of a cage, the complaint said.

Another plaintiff, a minor identified only as J.H., has been in custody since he was 14 and was placed in solitary at Suwannee Correctional Institution in Live Oak for 90 days when he was 16. Since his transfer to Florida State Prison in December, he has been kept separated from the rest of the population and rarely let out of his cell. He has been in the exercise cages once and the day room twice in the last five months.

Angel Meddler, a 21-year-old black woman with asthma, anxiety and mood disorders, has been in isolation for more than three years at Lowell Correctional Institution Annex in Ocala. She has been placed in a suicide watch cell 12 times. She is eligible to get her GED but cannot because she is in isolation, the complaint said.

Juan Espinosa, 58, is in isolation at the Reception and Medical Center in Lake Butler. He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, major disruptive disorder and bipolar disorder and has hallucinations and mood swings. He tried to kill himself at least five times before he was placed in isolation. He also has tumors in his throat that makes swallowing difficult.

He’s been in and out of isolation since last June.

Jerome Burgess, 46, is black and uses a wheelchair. He’s been in isolation since September 2017. The cell where he is isolated for 22 hours a day is not big enough for him to use his wheelchair.

James W. Kendrick, Jr., is 39, black, has diabetes, high blood pressure and is obese. He was placed in maximum management last June and kept there through October after being accused of beating a corrections officer. He is isolated in a wing with inmates assigned to disciplinary confinement, where his out-of-cell exercise, visits, phone calls and reading materials are restricted.

“Depriving anyone of human contact exacerbates mental health conditions and leaves people unprepared to face life outside of prison, even though most will be returned to their communities,” said Christopher Jones, executive director of Florida Legal Services.

288,Armed detention deputy accused in road rage incident in Florida Keys,"Jatavi Wendall Lee told deputies that he was running late for work at the Stock Island jail.

KEY LARGO, Fla. - A Monroe County detention deputy was arrested Tuesday after authorities said he drove erratically, nearly causing multiple collisions, and then berated one of the drivers while armed and in uniform.

Jatavi Wendall Lee, 35, of Miami, faces charges of reckless driving and obstructing a highway.

Adam Linhardt, a spokesman for the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, said the incident happened March 29 when Lee was driving along the Overseas Highway in Key Largo.

A motorist who witnessed Lee's reckless driving contacted the Monroe County Sheriff's Office and provided deputies with video of the incident from his dashboard camera, Linhardt said.

Witnesses told deputies that Lee was driving at high rate of speed and weaving in and out of lanes. Linhardt said Lee almost caused two collisions with his erratic maneuvers.

At one point, Lee, while driving an unmarked black car, illegally passed a white pickup truck, Linhardt said. After Lee passed the truck, he abruptly stopped, causing drivers behind him to slam on their brakes to avoid a crash, deputies said. Lee then got out of the car and shouted obscenities at the driver of the pickup truck, witnesses said.

Wearing a Sheriff's Office uniform and gun belt, Lee told the truck driver to “never do that again,” saying the truck driver didn't know where he was going, Lindhardt said.

The truck driver, a retired firefighter, said he did not report incident out of respect for law enforcement, but once he was contacted by deputies he corroborated the account of the man with the dashboard camera. The truck driver said Lee did not use any police lights during the stop. Linhardt added that as a detention deputy, Lee was not authorized to make traffic stops.

When questioned by deputies, Lee said he was running late for work at the Stock Island jail and admitted to driving erratically and stopping traffic.

At the time of the incident, Linhardt said Lee, who was hired as a detention deputy in 2017, was on probation in Miami-Dade County after he pleaded no contest to domestic battery and theft of a license plate tag in 2018.

According to Miami Gardens police, Lee slapped the mother of one of his children across the face when he ran into her and her new boyfriend at his child's day care center. He then followed the woman to a nearby gas station, where he stole the woman's license plate and threatened to shoot the couple, police said.

In 2009, Lee was accused of battery against the same woman.

The Monroe County Sheriff's Office has started the process to terminate Lee. He will have a hearing to determine whether he will be terminated on May 13. In the meantime, Lee has been placed on leave without pay and ordered to turn in his badge and uniform.

""I take these incidents very seriously,"" Sheriff Rick Ramsay said in a statement. ""I expect the highest level of professional conduct from Sheriff's Office staff. This type of behavior will never be tolerated under my leadership as reflected in the actions we have taken.""

289,"Orlando woman arrested for threatening kids with gun, deputies say","- An Orlando woman has been arrested after police say she threatened a group of children with a loaded gun.

According to a police report from the Orange County Sheriff's Office, Christina Thomas, 42, was arrested Monday at a home on Picadilly Circus Court in Orlando.

The sheriff's office says that a group of children told them that a black female wearing a white shirt, blue jeans and a black backpack had threatened them with a gun. The children also reportedly told deputies that the woman made threats to shoot up the apartment complex ""like the 4th of July.""

One child claims to have seen the woman pull out a silver and black handgun and point it at them as they ran away. The kids then flagged someone down and called 911.

The deputy that responded to the scene came across Thomas sitting on a porch less than 10 feet from where the incident occurred and who matched the description the children gave authorities. The deputy made repeated requests to Thomas to come out from the porch area.

292,Orange County man said stranger yelled anti-Semitic insults at him while he was landscaping,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - An Orange County homeowner said a woman drove onto his private property causing damage to his landscaping while hurling anti-Semitic insults.

Jeff Gelman said the incident happened Saturday while he was having breakfast with his wife and believes the woman drove in through an unlocked gate.

“We looked out to window and we saw someone doing donuts in our backyard, right there,” Gelman said.

Gelman said he has never seen the woman before.

Orange County Sheriff's deputies identified the woman as Kristen Kelly. The 45-year-old Winter Garden woman is accused of verbally attacking the Gelmans at at one point trying to run them over with her Dodge SUV.

“She was yelling, go home Jew tell your neighbors that Jesus Christ is here and that I’m going to clean some dirty Jews,” Gelman said.

Gelman said he snapped pictures of the woman and her vehicle to help authorities catch her.

“We didn’t recognize her at all; never saw her in our lives.”

The Windermere father said things got worse when he and his wife tried approaching Kelly to ask her to get off their property.

“When she got out of the car she sprayed us with detergent and said ‘cleaning the dirty Jews,’” Gelman said.

Kelly is charged with aggravated assault and is being held at the Orange County jail.

302,"After addiction and loss, Seminole mother finds strength in family, customs and herself","Every time Dakota Osceola hit rock bottom, she had the will to get back up and a mom who stood by her with outstretched hands — no judgment, no shaming, no ultimatums.

Through years of Dakota’s drug addiction, rehab treatments, depression, the overdose deaths of her friends, relapses and unhealthy relationships, Tina Marie Osceola was there — a stable, determined force of tough love and support for her daughter regardless of the circumstances and decisions that led her girl down an agonizing path.

“There was no playbook to go by, other than the way I was raised by my own parents,” Osceola said. “I wanted Dakota to know that I would always be there, regardless of what the problem was. If your kid feels like you’re judging them, they’re going to think you think they’re a bad person. And they’re not going to come to you. They’re going to shut you out.”

Dakota Osceola and her daughter, Mia, walk down the driveway of their home in Naples on May 3, 2019. Many members of their family, including Dakota's mother, brother, and grandparents, live on the same street as Dakota and Mia. ""We have everything we need, and that's each other,"" she said. ""We're trying to be financially independent, trying our best to work as hard as we can to accomplish our goals, and that's really what it's been about since the beginning of the Osceolas."" (Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Osceola said she had to check herself frequently when figuring out how to help her daughter and how involved to get in Dakota’s life during her difficult periods.

In Osceola’s experience, giving tough love sometimes meant letting Dakota sit in jail when she was arrested, taking her to rehab centers again and again, telling her daughter what she needed to hear and letting her make her own mistakes while remaining vigilant.

Osceola said she’s a problem solver and a fixer. But she knew she couldn’t fix her daughter’s problems for her no matter how much she wanted to.

“It’s letting them fall,” Osceola said. “It’s the hardest thing a parent can do. But if you don’t let them hit their own version of rock bottom and let them get back up themselves, they’re not going to find that road to recovery.”

She left an abusive relationship and is a single mom to her 2-year-old daughter, Mia. She has become actively involved in her family’s Seminole culture, including causes related to indigenous women’s issues. She raises awareness about violence against women and raises money for the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center.

Dakota started a business selling traditional Seminole jewelry. She spends hours every day buried in beads, creating necklaces, bracelets and earrings in intricate color patterns. Dakota and her mom, who also beads, sell their creations on Seminole and Miccosukee reservations in South Florida and beyond.

“I’m really proud. It saved my life,” Dakota said of beading.

History of drug use

Dakota said she started partying and skipping class in high school. She said she started smoking marijuana when she was 16 years old. She eventually moved on to hallucinogens. Then Xanax.

“That was my first time getting to the point where I wasn’t remembering giant blocks of time,” she said.

In 2012, when Dakota was 18, Collier County Sheriff’s deputies arrested her at her mom’s house on charges of possession of alcohol by a minor, marijuana and drug paraphernalia. She was arrested again soon after being released from the Collier jail on another marijuana possession charge.

Osceola was out of town a lot because of her job with the Seminole Tribe of Florida. She’s currently a tribal judge and worked at the Sheriff’s Office from 1995 to 2004.

Osceola said it felt like she blinked and things changed with her daughter. She can’t remember when the transition happened.

“I was on the road a lot, and so I think that’s why it seemed like it happened so fast…,” she said.

Dakota’s drug use became an emergency for Osceola, and she wanted it to be everybody else’s emergency, too. When Osceola needed help for herself and her daughter, she turned to her tribe and her former coworkers at the Sheriff’s Office. They became her extended support network. She reached out to whatever resources she could find.

“I didn’t care if they arrested her. That was fine,” Osceola said. “Jail, institutions or death, and I’ll choose jail. I’ll choose an institution for my daughter. Who wants to choose death?”

Dakota was always open about her struggles, her mom said. She’s unapologetically herself and was brutally honest about her addiction. It was never a secret, but it was still difficult for Osceola to accept.

“I’m the one who had to tell myself the truth about what was really going on most of the time,” Osceola said. “I had to be brave enough to start asking questions. And that’s not easy when you know your child will tell you the truth. That’s the ground floor of denial, not knowing and not being brave enough to even ask the questions.”

Dakota’s first rehab treatment began days after her 2012 arrest. She stayed at a treatment center for about 100 days, she said.

“It gave me a dose of independence and really showed me what life could be,” Dakota said.

Her sobriety didn’t last long when she got back home. She had more rehab stints between 2013 and 2015. A series of traumatic losses compounded her struggle.

One friend died in a motorcycle crash. Others died of overdoses. A guy she was dating died of an overdose in March 2015, one day after the pair went looking for apartments to move into together.

“ … My drug use went off the charts after that happened,” Dakota said. “I was self-medicating not to feel that pain.”

Dakota’s mom took her to a rehab center in Tampa three days later.

“After that I was like, you know what? This is the reality of it: You can either die, go to jail, or be institutionalized for the rest of your life because you did some pretty bad harm to yourself,” Dakota said. “I didn’t take it seriously before that.”

Beading, beading, beading

Dakota believes beautiful things can come from terrible situations.

Everything she has gone through, she said, was meant to happen to bring better things into her life. She feels that way about her beadwork and her daughter.

In 2015, during one of their weekly phone calls when she was at the Tampa center, Dakota asked her mom to bring her plastic bin full of beads.

Osceola visited a bead store in Naples and bought pliers and wire. She stuffed Dakota’s bead bin with everything she would need and delivered it to her.

Dakota grew up in a house full of beads. When she was little, she sat in her family’s booths at various reservations while they sold their art.

Her mom has had a massive collection since she was a kid, and when Dakota was about 5 years old, she started collecting her own.

Osceola grew up in Naples but lived within her tribal culture. Her life was all about her family and the traditional art they made and sold so they could pay the bills. Her aunts and cousins sew Seminole patchwork “like no one’s business,” and her dad makes jewelry. Osceola learned how to weave baskets, make dolls and sew, though she said she was a failure as a seamstress. Osceola and her dad also have a beading business together.

“Beading was my thing,” Osceola said.

(Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

And it’s become her daughter’s thing. Making traditional art for survival took on a different meaning for Dakota. She didn’t need to make jewelry to support a family, pay bills or put herself through school; she needed it to work through her struggles.

The day Dakota picked up her beads at the rehab facility became her first day of healing.

“I was like: Wow, I really love this. This is what’s gonna keep me sober,” Dakota said. “This is what’s gonna keep me clean. This is what’s gonna give me purpose.”

Dakota began thriving. She made jewelry for her friends in rehab and taught some of them how to bead. When she left the center, she got a booth at a market in Ybor City near downtown Tampa and sold countless pieces.

“You know, that independence and the ability to set goals for herself, and to know that she did it and it was 100 percent her effort … that did more than anything toward her sobriety,” Osceola said.

Finding peace

Dakota had another major obstacle to overcome before she found her peace.

She said she was in an abusive relationship with her daughter’s father. Dakota said he was physically abusive before she became pregnant and he didn’t stop after. The man was arrested on a domestic battery charge in late 2015 after hitting Dakota in the face, court records show.

Dakota said she was on the phone with her mom when her ex hit her, and she told her mom what happened.

Looking back on that day, Dakota’s mom said her daughter’s life sometimes felt like she was walking back through some of her own experiences.

“I had to get past an emotional reaction and wanting to be the mom that picks up a stick, goes out and beats the crap out of somebody to rational thought,” Osceola said.

She had to think to herself: What tools have I learned along the way?

Osceola said she experienced a years-long abusive relationship when she was in college. She said she thought the abuse was her fault at the time, that she must have done something to deserve it. She stayed for five years, and it was five years too long, she said.

Osceola knows her daughter. She knows telling Dakota what to do doesn’t work, because being told what to do didn’t work for Osceola, either. Osceola checked herself again.

She believed in allowing her daughter to make her own mistakes before. To reach rock bottom so she could get back up. But Dakota had only been in recovery for a few months. She wasn’t on solid ground just yet.

“I knew this was something that could push her over the edge,” Osceola said.

This was not a rock bottom she would let her daughter reach.

Osceola put her foot down in her own way. She told Dakota she couldn’t let the man do that to her and asked her daughter to let her call the Sheriff’s Office.

The man was arrested. He was adjudicated guilty in 2016 and sentenced to a year in the county jail with credit for time served, followed by three years of state probation.

Dakota said she tried to work things out with him when he was released from the jail. She knew immediately it wouldn’t work out. She said she thinks he would have become violent again.

“I didn’t want that around my child,” she said.

Dakota moved back to Naples after the incident. She had her family’s support throughout her pregnancy and in the two years since she had Mia.

Dakota said she now feels like she’s in a good place — in her home, her work and motherhood.

“My daughter’s happy,” Dakota said. “She loves this space, she loves our house, she loves coming home. And that’s where I wanna be. This is where I’m happy.”

It takes a tribe

Dakota said her mom and grandparents have given her everything she needs emotionally and mentally.

She and her mom get their strength from their family, their culture and their moments of darkness.

When Dakota was using drugs, and even when she wasn’t, her mom was always there to pick her up and come up with solutions to whatever she was going through. Her grandma was there to make her feel warm and loved. Her grandma made her feel like she was something special.

Dakota and her mom said they also derive their strength from what it means to be indigenous women: community-oriented, strong, loving, accepting. Warriors.

Since Dakota started selling her jewelry on reservations, she has opened herself up to people and made lasting friendships with other indigenous women. They support each other’s businesses and talk about their traditional arts and preserving culture.

“We all try to empower each other,” Dakota said. “We show up for each other and have our own economy.”

The strength, rich culture and power that Dakota’s family has passed on to her is something she wants to pass on to Mia.

Dakota’s mom was driven to work, be financially independent, support her family and be involved in tribal issues locally and nationally. Now Dakota is at a stage in which she values her business, financial independence, providing for her daughter and being involved in her community.

Everything the Osceolas do they do together, for each other, and with the help of their family.

She’s raising Mia with a secure, united family. Dakota likes to say her mom is a badass, and that she’s lucky to be a mom to a little girl she knows is going to turn out the same way.

“I want Mia to be unapologetically herself, no matter how weird or silly that may be,” Dakota said. “To treat people how she wants to be treated and never settle for anybody less than what her family can provide for her.”

Dakota has a lot of hope — for her daughter, herself, her business, her future.

That hope came from surviving her addictions and finding her power through family background. She said she has lost the desire to use drugs. While she feels like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders, she works on herself and her mental health regularly and makes sure she maintains a healthy, balanced lifestyle.

(Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Dakota’s mom said addiction runs in their family. And substance abuse issues affect indigenous populations in general. Osceola has worried about history repeating itself, but she believes in Dakota and her commitment to her sobriety.

“I think a lot of people in our society look at addiction as a weakness instead of a source of strength,” Osceola said. “That’s not our weakness. The battles native people have gone through, it’s not our weakness. It’s our strength that we survived.”

During that final stint in rehab, Dakota willed herself to get back up. Her survival is inextricably linked to the strength she gets from her family.

“We have everything we need, and that’s each other,” Dakota said.

Story Highlights Hurricane Michael made landfall seven months ago

Areas like Mexico Beach and eastern Panama City are still disaster zones, with recovery taking time

Congress has failed to pass any supplemental relief funding for the Florida Panhandle

Sitting inside the quaint Caribbean Coffee restaurant in Mexico Beach, it’s a normal Wednesday afternoon.

The owner, Dave Kiser, is busy making cappuccinos and chicken salad croissant sandwiches for a small line of customers. Beacon Hill residents Dana and Charlie Black sit at a table near the front window, drinking coffee and talking about their fitness studio, Fit as a Fiddle, which is located in neighboring Windmark Beach.

Caribbean Coffee is located on the north side of U.S. 98, with a crystal clear view of the Gulf of Mexico visible from the shop’s front windows. But as beautiful as the view may be, it still gives the Blacks pause. Just seven months ago, you wouldn’t have been able to see the Gulf of Mexico from the shop window.

“There used to be houses there. It was all houses, our neighbors. My friend Natalie lived over there,” Dana Black said, pointing across the street to an empty beachfront lot. “When she returned after the storm, all she found left of her house were two plates. People drive over here and they look at views like that and they think, ‘Oh, this looks really good.’ But for people who live here, it just makes us sad. Because we know what it used to be.”

Seven months after Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 monstrosity, struck the eastern Florida Panhandle on Oct. 10, residents in the hardest-hit areas are only now starting to find a sense of normalcy.

A massive storm: Hurricane Michael upgraded to Category 5 — only fourth on record

Financial toll: Hurricane Michael insurance losses top $4.65 billion

That new normal looks different every few miles. In Mexico Beach, for instance, construction workers and contractors outnumber the remaining residents 10 to one. Houses (the ones that are lucky enough to still be intact) have insurance claim numbers spray painted on their exterior walls. “For Sale” signs sit next to rows of empty house foundations on streets that used to be lined with million-dollar mansions.

In Panama City, neighborhood streets look more like nuclear war zones than habitable housing developments. Twisted trees that used to tower over homes are now resting in the homes’ living rooms, and piles of debris dot every street corner. Many restaurants and businesses have reopened — some still with plywood on the windows, but with the words “We’re open!” enthusiastically painted on the wood.

As lawmakers in Washington continue to spar over the details of supplemental disaster relief funding that has still not made its way to the devastated Panhandle, residents who are living there are just trying to get by, day by day.

“We are still living in a disaster,” said Diane Pugh, who’s living in a FEMA trailer in what used to be her front yard in Mexico Beach. “We need gas stations, furniture stores, groceries. We just need help, period.”

Stories of survival and sunsets

Nearly everyone you come across in Mexico Beach and Panama City has their own Hurricane Michael story.

Some rode out the storms in their houses, like Pugh, who recalled floating in her bedroom on her mattress with her Chihuahua, Zoey, until she finally heard the wind die down.

Some, like church pastor Dave Gieseking, evacuated, only to return when it was finally safe just to find their homes completely gone.

Charlie and Dana Black, the couple in the coffee shop, rode out the storm in their Beacon Hill home, in their bathroom with their mattress on top of them.

“I guess at about 6:15 p.m. the rain finally stopped, you could see the end of the storm,” Charlie Black said. “It came right in and blew right over us, and then I’ll never forget that night. There was the most beautiful sunset after the storm.”

Like Charlie Black, many residents who stayed behind to rebuild after the hurricane do their best to find the “sunset” in every day.

Gieseking, the church pastor, used to hold Sunday services in his Living Water Church at the Beach on U.S. 98 in Mexico Beach. Now, all that’s left of the church is the foundation, and Gieseking lives in a FEMA trailer on the church’s property. But he still holds services every Sunday — only now, they’re on the beach instead of in a church.

“Day to day, it’s just trying to connect up with people and find out who’s still here and who’s not,” he said, standing on the foundation of his old church. “It’s slow, person-to-person kind of stuff, because a good number of people are now scattered all across the country. With the people who are still here, they range from going through depression to determination.”

Olga Cemore lived in Panama City during the hurricane, but has since moved to Dallas because she was unable to find work in the area after the storm. But she came back to the area this past week to pass out Home Depot gift cards to churches from a virtual triathlon she held to raise money for the area. Cemore gave Gieseking a hand full of $50 Home Depot gift cards to help his church buy materials for their new structure.

“I hosted a triathlon here for 13 years, but obviously this year, we couldn’t do it,” Cemore said. “So I did a virtual run, people signed up for it online and I mailed them a bib number and a medal. We collected over $5,000, so I bought a bunch of gift cards and am driving around today handing them out to churches and people.”

Clutching the stack of gift cards in his hand and standing on the empty lot his church used to be on, Gieseking told Cemore how grateful he was for the help and gave her a hug.

“Sometimes you look around here and go, ‘what’s going to happen?’” Gieseking said. “But we’re going to make it work, whatever it takes.”

Day by day, rebuilding is happening everywhere

The hurricane permanently displaced thousands of Panhandle residents, most of whom had no home to go back to or office building from which to work. But for those who stayed behind, the process of rebuilding will be long, arduous — and worth it.

The Blacks said they considered themselves the “lucky ones.” Their home sustained minor roof damage, loss of power and some flooding, but they have been able to remain in their home as they await contractors to come. Their gym, Fit as a Fiddle, lost more than half its clientele after the storm.

“Dana came home after we first opened back up, and she was really upset,” Charlie Black said. “People were calling her to say, ‘I can’t be a member anymore, I’m homeless,’ or, ‘I’m living with my son in Little Rock until we can rebuild.’ A lot of people haven’t come back, and will probably never come back.”

Dana Black said one of the biggest challenges facing residents as they try and rebuild is finding qualified, honest contractors. She said a lot of people came to the area after the storm and scammed residents by price gouging, promising work that was never done and taking money for doing shoddy construction work.

“The worst part of all of it is that people need roofs, but people are coming in trying to help us but they jack the prices way up,” she said. “And some people don’t have insurance.”

Pugh, the woman living in a FEMA trailer in her front yard, said she was lucky to have a family friend who was a contractor who was working on fixing her home. The biggest challenge facing her, she said, was the lack of access to groceries, medical care and basic needs like gas.

“It’s still hard just trying to get basic things,” Pugh said. “Gas stations, stores, they’re all gone. You’ve got to go down to Port St. Joe, or I go to Callaway, but it’s real hard when you’re used to just being able to walk up the street.”

Gieseking, the church pastor, said one of the most critical parts of rebuilding the area will be Tyndall Air Force Base, which is sandwiched in between Mexico City and Panama City. The base was a huge economic anchor for the area and was decimated during Michael. Reconstruction on base stopped May 1 when Congress failed to pass a supplemental funding bill.

President Donald Trump toured Tyndall on Wednesday before his rally in Panama City Beach, and vowed to rebuild the base.

Gieseking said many residents are waiting to return until the future of the base is more certain, but until then, those who stayed behind are taking things day by day, brick by brick.

“We want people to know that we’re still here,” he said. “We’re still here, and we’re going to rebuild, and we’re going to be this quaint little town on the coast again. They called us the ‘Forgotten Coast’ for a long time before the storm, but to me, now, we’re the ‘Unforgettable Coast.’”

307,NASA is using the same space suits astronauts wore 30 years ago. Experts say that needs to change.,"When astronauts Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson conducted the space shuttle program’s first spacewalk in 1983, they probably wouldn’t have imagined their spacesuits would still be in use on the International Space Station some 36 years later.

Not only are they still in use but the suits, intended to last 15 years, are currently the only ones available for astronauts whizzing around Earth at thousands of miles per hour.

Now, as NASA prepares to head back to the moon, the agency must scramble to develop a next-generation suit or the next American astronauts will be forced to don some hand-me-down, 1980s equipment.

Sure, the suits get updated after six years in orbit or 25 spacewalks, but with outdated technology and only a limited quantity available, the fact of the matter is the nearly 40-year-old suits NASA employs will not serve the needs of future moonwalkers.

The current spacesuits are expected to last until 2028 – four years after NASA hopes to land astronauts on the moon again.But a series of incidents and issues from the spacesuits, like the all-female spacewalk cancellation in March caused by a lack of available suits, suggests the need for change is more urgent.

NASA has known for a while that it needs to update its spacesuits. The agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel reiterated the urgency to develop the next-generation suit during a meeting last month.

In 2017, a similar report by NASA's inspector general came to the same conclusion and stated ""the agency remains years away from having a flight-ready spacesuit capable of replacing the EMU or suitable for use on future exploration missions.""

EMUs, or Extravehicular Mobility Units, are the current suits used on the ISS.

Considered to be a “mini spacecraft” in itself, the spacesuit astronauts currently wear to survive the harsh environment of space is complex and requires major modifications based on the user.

""The EMU, of course, is very bulky. It's a big, bulky, awkward suit to work in,"" former NASA astronaut Winston Scott told FLORIDA TODAY. ""But your life depends on it. It is a totally self-contained life support system.""

Since the retirement of the shuttle program in 2011, ""NASA has had limited ability to return the EMUs from the ISS because only one of the commercial vehicles that ferry supplies to the station has the capability to return items to Earth,"" according to the inspector general's report.

""As a result, astronauts are using the EMUs for much longer periods of time between maintenance and refurbishment than originally intended,"" the report reads.

And only 11 of the 18 ""EMU Primary Life Support System units,"" backpack-like structures required to keep astronauts alive when conducting spacewalks, are still in use. Five were destroyed in the Challenger and Columbia disasters as well as the SpaceX cargo mission that broke apart in 2015. Another was lost during ground testing and the last was built for certification only and is not suitable for flight.

NASA has had years to develop a next-generation spacesuit, but a ""lack of a formal plan and specific destinations for future missions has complicated spacesuit development,"" the report noted.

Starting in 2005 with the establishment of the Constellation program, which called for the development of a suite of vehicles to take astronauts back to the moon and beyond, NASA has spent almost $200 million on three spacesuit development efforts.

On May 1, NASA said on Twitter there would be a ""transition suit"" for the first mission to return to the moon that would include modern designs for astronauts to explore the lunar surface. As to what those advancements will be or what the transition suit will entail, the agency is still unsure.

""We’re looking at internal and external options for a transition spacesuit for the Moon 2024 landing with American astronauts as well as options for modern spacesuits for sustainable surface missions,"" NASA spokeswoman Cheryl Warner said.

Possible future spacesuits

On the local front, Florida Institute of Technology academics has their own ideas on how to upgrade NASA's spacesuits.

In 2016, Ondrej Doule, director and founder of the university's Human Spaceflight Laboratory, along with students and team members, won the grand prize for their design of the interior of a single-person spacecraft in the Genesis Engineering Solutions competition.

The ""Wholly Human Integrated Single Person Spacecraft"" could replace the current spacesuits, Doule said. Instead of modeling the single-person spacecraft to look like a suit, the device would essentially become a mini-spacecraft with robotic arms and would have enough room for one astronaut.

Not only could any astronaut perform spacewalks regardless of their body shape, the walks would also be safer to perform because the robotic arms would do all the repairs needed outside of the space station instead of the actual astronauts, Doule said.

Though NASA does not know what the next spacesuit will look like, the agency is casting a wide net in its search.

As part of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, the agency is funding 18 studies, one of which includes the development of a ""SmartSuit,"" an intelligent suit designed with self-healing skin and data collection for spacewalks in extreme environments, NASA said last month.

The SmartSuit could be used to travel to other celestial bodies like the moon and Mars, and will incorporate ""soft-robotics technology that allows astronauts to be highly mobile and better interact with their surroundings,"" according to the release.

The $125,000 project, however, is only in the first phase and can only receive additional funding after successful studies and a transition to the second phase.

Scott, who conducted three spacewalks in NASA's current spacesuit, has his own wishes for how future suits should operate.

""An ideal spacesuit would be one that you don't even think about while you're wearing it,"" Scott said. ""So that means the suit would be light. It would fit you, it wouldn't be big and bulky.""

Instead of inhibiting movement, vision or restricting the astronaut in any way, Scott hopes for a much lighter, tighter-fit suit that still protects the astronaut. He also wouldn't mind an ""Iron Man"" version of a spacesuit.

""Perhaps the suit will be smaller and lighter than what we have, but maybe with some human assist functions like some robotics inside the suit to help you move,"" Scott said. ""Like the suits we develop for our military, the super soldier suits. Like the real version of Iron Man.""

Current suits won't work for deep space missions

With the race back on to send humans to the moon again by 2024, why won't the current spacesuits work if they've already been approved to last until 2028?

According to the inspector general's report, spacesuit requirements vary for each mission. A spacesuit designed for the moon has different needs than one for Mars since ""each destination has different temperatures, radiation levels, pressures, mobility requirements, and exposure to dust and debris.""

Though the current spacesuits are sufficient for use aboard the space station, it won't suffice for deep space exploration missions.

""For example, the current EMU lacks the hip and flexibility needed to walk on and explore planetary surfaces,"" the report reads.

Typically, spacesuits are designed with the mission in mind.

Custom-fit suits were made specifically for astronauts of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions. But with the shuttle program, NASA took a different approach.

As the astronaut class grew larger, it became too expensive to custom-tailor each suit to each astronaut. Instead, NASA’s current suits are a combination of several detachable parts that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

This allows multiple astronauts to wear the same suit, something the agency has done since the 1980s. But that's not to say they haven't come with their own sets of issues.

Past incidents and current issues

CLOSE Astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch were to make landmark history, but NASA canceled it keeping their safety in mind before anything else. USA TODAY

In March, NASA was planning the first all-female spacewalkwith astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch. But a lack of readily available spacesuits aboard the space station prevented a historic event from occurring.

With limited sizes available, sometimes astronauts — usually females — cannot perform spacewalks due to sizing issues with available spacesuits, NASA design engineer Elizabeth Benson said in a 2009 paper named ""Complexity of Sizing for Space Suit Applications.""

This was essentially the problem with the planned all-female spacewalk – both McClain and Koch required mediums, but there was only one on board that would be ready in time, NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz said.

A simple solution would have been making more sizes available, but due to high costs, NASA had to downgrade the options to only medium, large and extra large sizes, preventing smaller astronauts from wearing the suits and conducting spacewalks.

And if limited sizing and quantity weren't already issues, according to NASA, a spacesuit weighs approximately 280 pounds on the ground. In space, it may not weigh anything, but that still doesn't mean astronauts aren't carrying around all that mass, Scott said.

""Its bulk makes it difficult to work in and some of the smaller stature people or some of the weaker physical people can't manipulate the suit,"" Scott said. ""And of course, they may or may not be able to conduct a spacewalk.""

Kathryn Sullivan, the first American woman to perform a spacewalk in 1985, had her own issues with the suit. In an interview with Outside Magazine in April, Sullivan explained how the suit never fit her correctly.

""The suit's knee was a bit above mine,"" she told the magazine. ""Every time I needed to bend, I wasn't bending a natural joint.""

Astronaut Linda Godwin also told the magazine the shoulders of the spacesuit were the biggest issue.

The suits were initially designed to fit a wide variety of both women and men, but that changed after the agency cut back in sizes.

Astronaut Peggy Whitson, who holds the American record for time spent in space, said in a documentary interview: ""As a woman, doing spacewalks is more challenging, mostly because the suits are sized bigger than the average female.""

So why is this a big deal?

As men and women of different shapes and sizes join NASA's astronaut corps, a poorly fitted suit not only prevents certain astronauts from conducting spacewalks, but ""can also increase the effort that a wearer must exert to move in the suit, since their joints are not lined up with the suit joints,"" Benson said.

""Also, a poorly fit suit has the potential to actually impinge on the wearer during motion and lead to a reduction in mobility and risk of injury,"" she said.

In space, astronauts are essentially floating within their pressurized spacesuit, Scott said. Because the suit is pressurized, which basically means the suit is inflated like a balloon, a common problem astronauts find when wearing the suit is the ability to bend their joints.

""Imagine you're trying to reach for a tool in space and you're reaching to wrap your fingers around the tool. When you try to close and open your fingers, your suit is working against you because it's pressurized,"" Scott said.

In fact, since they were designed in the 1970s, there have been more than 3,400 anomalies with the current spacesuits, according to the inspector general's report. They range from a loose boot thread to glove damage, uncomfortable body temperatures and helmet water intrusions.

Such was the case in 2013 when European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano reported water, a little over a third of a gallon, in his helmet while conducting a spacewalk. A similar instance occurred again in 2016 with NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra. Both spacewalks were terminated early.

None of the incidents that occurred during spacewalks have resulted in deaths or serious injuries, and only five were terminated early. But that's not to say a new spacesuit isn't necessary for future space exploration.

""As we go forward in space, we need to figure out ways to build suits that provide the protection that you need,"" Scott said. ""But also that are lighter and more flexible and better able to allow a person to work in them.""

308,Jesse Watters Finds a Way to Jeer Ilhan Omar's Death Threats,"Screenshot: Fox News

Fox News host Jesse Waters—known for spewing racist, sexist putrid garbage all over the network—simply couldn’t help himself on Wednesday evening’s episode of The Five, shit-talking Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and shrugging off the arrests of people who have made threats on her life.



Speaking about Meghan McCain’s appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, where Meyers challenged McCain’s comments tying Omar to anti-Semitism, including the California synagogue shooting, Watters questioned why “the left” would stand up for Omar.



“I think the reason they do that, it’s not because they want to protect her personally, because she’s not that talented, she doesn’t raise a lot of money, she’s not that likable or empathetic,” Watters said. “The left wants to protect the ability of the left to traffic in anti-Semitism.”

Only on Fox News would a woman being “likable” and a “money maker” be a necessary excuse to defend her against threats on her life.

“I don’t think you want to be [to the left] when you’re in line for that late night show, and when everybody gets death threats. McCain gets them big time. We get them, we don’t whine about them,” Watters said, willfully minimizing the credible threats against Omar and the multiple arrests made in connection to them.



In New York, a man was arrested in April for calling Omar’s office and threatening to “put a bullet in her fucking skull,” later telling FBI agents “if our forefathers were still alive, they’d put a bullet in her head.” Two weeks later, a second man was arrested in Florida after making threats to Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib in a voicemail he left for Tlaib.

“...It was your Taliban, bitch, who fucking opened up her fucking towel head mouth about ‘some people did it,” the Florida man reportedly said. “You know what, she’s lucky she’s just getting death threats...So are you. All right?…‘Cuz the day when the bell tolls…and this country comes to a war, there will be no more threats.”

And a bomb threat was called into the California hotel where Omar made her speech against Islamophobia at the Council on American Islamic Relations of Greater Los Angeles banquet in March. That same month, the FBI opened an investigation into a threat written in a men’s bathroom in a Minnesota convenience store that read, “Assassinate Ilhan Omar.”

The first cut in the Marco Island police chief search has dwindled the candidate list from 81 to 12.

Eight of the 12 remaining candidates looking to replace outgoing Police Chief Al Schettino reside in Florida, including a few local candidates.

The 12 candidates are:

Asst. Chief John Barkley, Naples Police Department

Deputy Chief Jerry Connolly, Haines City Police Department

Captain John Crane-Baker, Delray Beach Police Department

Deputy Chief Tracy Frazzano, Montclair (N.J.) Police Department

Chief Anthony Giaimo, Florida Southwestern College Police Department

Captain Tina Heysler, Village of Palm Springs Police Department

Deputy Chief Michael Kreher, Atlanta Police Department

Deputy Chief Stephen McCosker, Ocoee Police Department

Deputy Chief Joseph Penze, Village of Niles (Ill.) Police Department

Assistant Chief Terrence Pierce, Gainesville Police Department

Retired Chief Tomas Sanchez, Hollywood Police Department

Chief Timothy Sheehan, Tewksbury (Ma.) Police Department

The candidates that survived the first cut will now complete a questionnaire before the next round of cuts names 4-8 finalists for the position.

During Monday's City Council meeting, City Manager David Harden said he hoped to have that short list by the council's May 20 meeting, which Florida Police Chiefs Association Executive Director Amy Mercer said was a possibility.

More: Marco Island police chief intends to retire June 15

The vacancy in the department was created in February after Schettino issued a letter on Feb. 21 announcing his retirement.

As more details came to light, it was revealed that his retirement was not of his choosing as Harden had originally requested his resignation after another embarrassing incident hit the police department.

In 2018, three members of the department were found to have had sex on duty, resulting in two of them tendering their resignations and another being terminated from the force. A fourth officer that knew about one of the officer's actions but didn't report it was reprimanded only to be promoted months later.

The woman involved with all of the officers has also announced her intention to sue the city for damages resulting from the negligence in hiring, retaining and supervising the offending officers.

The last straw, however, came when a high profile incident in which a man barricaded himself in his home with a cache of weapons, drawing a response from SWAT, could not be prosecuted due to the involvement of a Marco Island officer.

Despite the State Attorney's Office refusing for years to use Officer Tige Thompson as a witness in any criminal trials due to his tarnished credibility, he had remained on patrol during Schettino's watch.

In lieu of resigning, Schettino proposed retiring from the department on June 15, which was accepted by Harden.

Although Harden had originally believed the department could have a new police chief in place by that date, Mercer said Wednesday that she was not sure whether that would be feasible.

""I do believe they can possibly name their new chief by then but I am not sure if someone can begin that early due to backgrounds and having to give notice for their current position,"" Mercer said.

Once finalists are named, they will be invited to Marco Island for interviews and to participate in assessment exercises.

What that will look like has yet to be determined, Mercer said.

""We will work with the City Manager on determining the onsite process,"" Mercer said. ""Nothing has been finalized or discussed at this point in the process. However, those talks will begin shortly.""

LARGO, Fla. (WFLA) - A Tampa woman told police she resorted to stealing from a Largo CVS and asked to go to jail because she is ""addicted to heroin and cannot get help anywhere else.""

A arrest report shows that on May 5, Michelle Hildebrandt, 32, walked into the CVS Pharmacy at 2390 East Bay Dr. and ripped open various food items, dumping them out on the floor. When Largo police officers arrived, Hildebrandt asked them to take her to jail.

The report goes on to say Hildebrandt made spontaneous statements admitting to her actions and said she wanted to go to jail due to her addiction.

Even though Hildebrandt lives in Tampa, her father, Mike Morris, told News Channel 8 his daughter specifically went to Pinellas County to commit her crime because she heard that particular jail was better for addicts behind bars.

A former addict now clean for 25 years, Morris said he didn't mind that his daughter broke the law in order to get clean.

""She knew she needed to be some place where she couldn't just leave,"" he said. ""I'm proud of her for having gone to those lengths to try and get help.""

He explained his daughter started using heroin about two years ago after getting hooked on pills a couple years before that. Morris added that it took Hildebrandt three shoplifting attempts on Sunday to even get caught, going to two stores prior to CVS.

He also explained his daughter has tried to get help before but gave up when the withdrawals got too bad. She also doesn't have the money or insurance to cover entering a rehab facility.

For the sake of his 5-year-old granddaughter, Morris hopes his daughter's most recent act of desperation is enough to get her clean.

""There's literally millions of people out there right now that need help, and want help, but they can't get it because they don't have any money,"" he said.

She's the first woman to head the agency,"The new acting deputy director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — the first woman to head the federal agency — has her heart in Southwest Florida despite leading an agency based in Washington, D.C.

Regina Lombardo, 56 and known to everyone as ""Reggie"", looks fondly on her days in Fort Myers and Cape Coral when she worked in her parent's deli, was competitive in high school sports and modeled hairstyles for a top local stylist.

""It's been a ride,"" she said Tuesday, adding that the first female acting director aspect ""feels really profound.""

Lombardo said being the first female was never at the forefront of why she was at ATF.

""It's an agency that regulates gun laws,"" she said, and not really a place a lot of women generally think of or naturally gravitate to.

""I hope to change that,"" she said. ""I feel humble and proud. I hope to be a role model. You can't be what you can't see.""

The ATF protects communities from violent criminals, criminal organizations, the illegal use and trafficking of firearms, the illegal use and storage of explosives, acts of arson and bombings, acts of terrorism, and the illegal diversion of alcohol and tobacco products

Attorney General William P. Barr announced Lombardo's appointment April 24 and she was sworn-in as head of the agency on Wednesday, replacing retiring Deputy Director Thomas Brandon.

In a statement, Barr said Lombardo has proven herself an outstanding leader.

""She is well qualified to continue ATF's successes of recent years, including helping the Department investigate and prosecute more firearms offenders than ever before,"" he said.

Lombardo, speaking from ATF headquarters in Washington, D.C., said her heart is usually split between Southwest Florida and New York, where her family originally settled.

Where the heart is

""I still fight with that,"" she said. ""I go back to where my family is, where my heart is. When I go back to Fort Myers, it makes me feel peaceful. It still feels like home.""

Still, she loves her New York travels.

She also considers her path to the ATF a bit unorthodox, going from a family that had a legitimate liquor business to an agency that targets illicit liquor activities.

The Lombardos have roots that go deep into New York's past — she said one part of the family has the second liquor license issued — and they operated a wine and liquor business in East Harlem in the 1920s.

""We took out what we knew and brought it to Fort Myers,"" she said.

More: Fort Myers police unveil high-tech center it hopes will help catch criminals

No surprise to mom

Her promotion to the top came as no surprise to her mom, Milly Lombardo, 86, and older sister Rosemarie Lombardo, 63, both of whom still live in Southwest Florida.

""Mom is excited, and proud ... and worried,"" Rosemarie Lombardo said. She then added with a chuckle: ""She's not worried about the criminals, she's worried about Washington D.C.""

Rosemarie Lombardo, oldest of the four Lombardo children, said her little sister was no ballerina type.

""She was rough and tumble,"" she said. ""She was a very hard worker and determined. But she was friendly and sociable too.""

Rosemarie Lombardo said her sister worked at the family business in Cape Coral, Lombardo's Italian Deli and Bakery, started in New York by their grandparents.

Reggie Lombardo said the deli here first opened as an Italian food shop in Fort Myers on U.S. 41 and moved to the larger deli location in Cape Coral in 1979. Her parents closed it at the end of 2000.

""I don't think work (at the deli) was her first passion,"" Rosemarie Lombardo said.

That restaurant experience obviously stayed with her, Rosemarie Lombardo said. ""She is an avid cook,"" she said. ""She knows her food.""

Reggie Lombardo readily agreed.

""One of my passions is to cook,"" she said. ""That's where my creative side comes out.""

Her sister said Reggie Lombardo, along with her brother, Raphael, were also interested in dancing and would serve as hair style models when top local stylist Valentino did hair shows.

""We competed in disco and danced at the Edison pageant,"" Reggie Lombardo said.

Just a year apart in age from her brother, his death in 1996 devastated her.

""It was the greatest heartbreak of my life,"" she said.

Carolyn Rogers, of Fort Myers, said she and Lombardo went to school together, graduating from Bishop Verot High School in Fort Myers in 1981.

""My heart is full of pride for her today,"" Rogers said.

She remembers when the Lombardos moved to Cape Coral in the 1970s, the new ATF head was in fourth grade and the city was still fairly unpopulated.

""There was no more than 10,000 people living there,"" Rogers said.

Rogers remembered Lombardo working at the family business for a number of years.

""She’s beautiful, kind and amazing,"" she said. ""And quite an athlete in her day.""

Reggie Lombardo went to college assisted by a softball scholarship.

She figured out her future in college segueing from education to law and then to law enforcement.

""Not a lot of women wanted to work on bombs and explosives,"" she said. ""It was more of a challenge. That's what triggered me to focus.""

The new director is close to the mandatory retirement age for federal agency workers — 57 — but an extension isn't outside the realm of possibilities.

""Whatever role they want me to play,"" she said. ""I am willing, no discussions.""

BIG COPPITT KEY, Fla. - A Big Coppitt Key man was arrested Sunday afternoon after he beat up a woman and threw her into a canal, authorities said.

According to Monroe County Sheriff's Office spokesman Adam Linhardt, a deputy arrived to 9 Riviera Drive around 1 p.m. to find the 44-year-old victim bleeding profusely from the head and with multiple bruises throughout her body.

Linhardt said the woman told the deputy that Calvin Joseph Teal, 38, beat her, threw her down onto the floor and then threw her into the canal.

A neighbor told the deputy that Teal was asleep inside the home.

The deputy went inside the home and saw blood on the floor, ""a large amount of bloody paper towels in the kitchen trash can and a blood trail leading down a hallway to a bedroom where Teal was sleeping,"" Linhardt said.

Authorities said the victim was taken to the Lower Keys Medical Center on Stock Island, where she told a second deputy that Teal had hit her in the head with a conch shell before he threw her into the canal.

Teal was arrested. Authorities said they found a bottle of 34 Xanax pills that he didn't have a prescription for while he was being booked into jail. Teal faces charges of aggravated battery, possession of Xanax without a prescription and smuggling contraband (Xanax) into a detention facility.

A motive for the attack is unclear.

326,"Cape Coral mom celebrates miracle daughter this Mother's Day, 9 months after dad's death","CLOSE Cape Coral mom welcomes girl after dad's death Ricardo Rolon, Fort Myers News-Press

Tiffany Bannworth looks into the faces of her seven children and sees her husband.

They are all she has left of the man who'd been her life partner for nearly 20 years. Stephen Bannworth died in August in a Fort Myers motorcycle crash.

This Mother's Day, the Cape Coral mother will celebrate each of the boys they created and the miracle daughter born nine months after his death with a nice dinner and family outing.

""We're replacing a bad memory with remembrance of happiness and celebration,"" she said of the holidays and anniversaries since their lives upended.

Tiffany Bannworth sits with her children Dante Alexander, 16; Cairo Hawthorne, 12; Jasper Constantine, 10; Roman Zhivago, 8; Quinton Phineas,7; Kipling Cicero, 5; and Amunet Corencia Pearl, 2.5 weeks. Bannworth's husband Steven died in a motorcycle crash last year. Calling him the ""perfect husband"" he left her a lingering gift: A baby girl, born on Good Friday.

The six boys look like their dad Stephen Bannworth at different stages of his life, she said, as she cradles his final gift in her arms.

Amunet Corencia Pearl Bannworth arrived on Good Friday. The 35-year-old mother gave her the moniker they'd decided upon if it was girl during a 2007 pregnancy, their third.

""He would recognize it anywhere,"" she said of their daughter's name. Amunet is the Egyptian goddess of mystery. She joins siblings Dante, Cairo, Jasper, Roman, Quinton and Kipling Bannworth. A seventh son, Gatsby Bannworth, died six years ago at 3 months old.

Oldest son Dante, 16, said last year started out ""great at first,"" the six boys and their parents taking weekend outings and enjoying their time with one another.

Then, his father's death abruptly changed their trajectory.

""Now it sucks because my dad wanted a girl,"" Dante Bannworth said, his father's prayers answered in death, only never to see her.

Stephen Bannworth was a stay-at-home dad. He and Tiffany met and courted, having Dante when Tiffany was 19. Stephen supported her dreams, saw her through college and her doctorate.

She is now executive director at Nicaea Academy of Southwest Florida, a birth through college education facility in Cape Coral. Amunet sleeps in her mother's office, all six boys always nearby, attending classes.

The family's closeness is no surprise. It's what Stephen Bannworth cultivated, Tiffany Bannworth said.

Tiffany and Stephen Bannworth were with each other every day — a streak of 3,992 of them — since Sept. 1, 2007, she said. If she went on a quick archaeology trip — one of her many interests and qualifications — she left Saturday morning and returned Sunday night, making sure they kissed good-bye and hello.

Tiffany, an only child, had always known Stephen wanted a big family.

The Bannworth family is nearly three times the size of the average family. The U.S. Census Bureau counted about 83.09 million families with an average of 3.14 persons in 2018, down from 3.7 in the 1960s.

Dante was the first baby Tiffany Bannworth ever held. Within weeks, she told Stephen she wanted more. Lots more.

Four years after Dante, the Bannworths had five more sons within six years.

Their sixth, Gatsby, died in his sleep three months after his birth.

""We thought that was the unthinkable,"" she said. But Stephen held the family together.

""He was so strong and cultivated a tight-knit family,"" she said. ""A part of our hearts were missing. He carried us through the grief.""

Within the year, son Kipling was born, and Stephen understood Tiffany's fears of losing another child.

""I was scared it could happen again,"" Tiffany Bannworth said. ""He said he would quit his job and watch Kipling until he went to school.""

He kept that promise: Kipling started kindergarten days after Stephen's death.

In the years between, Stephen Bannworth washed their clothes, cooked and cleaned and did all the home repairs himself.

""Some people thought he was just some schlub,"" she said. ""He was so incredible. He was more of a man than I could ever imagine meeting.""

Their passion lasted their entire marriage.

Over the summer, the family car needed replacing.

While waiting on a new vehicle to arrive last August, Stephen Bannworth would take Tiffany to work on the back of his motorcycle. He did so the Saturday before his death.

He would park across from the main building on campus and rev the engine as she walked across the lot.

""He'd blow kisses and wink,"" she said. ""I still got flustered. We were really love struck.""

She drove the new vehicle to school for the first time the morning he died. He had fixed the locks on the vehicle to prepare it for use the day before. He'd also repaired the curio cabinet glass, cleaned the house and washed every bit of laundry, not knowing he wouldn't return from his motorcycle ride.

She remembers the acute feeling of loss in the days after his death — she didn't have a single stitch of clothing remaining that carried his scent.

""The glaring absence of him was noticed by me,"" she said, adding she was in her bed, crying to God: ""Let me be pregnant with his last child.'""

Then, when her pregnancy was confirmed six weeks later, ""How blessed I felt. What a miracle it was.""

Friends, family and even strangers stepped up to help fill the void. A GoFundMe campaign raised more than $12,000; a woman linked to the Nicaea school paid for the entire funeral. Christmas came and people showered the family with gift cards.

People told her stories about how Stephen had helped them, without her ever knowing.

On the weekend that would have been their wedding anniversary, friends gathered to celebrate the couple. The next day, Tiffany Bannworth said, 50 people came to her baby shower.

On her birthday Tuesday, the school's students gathered around a store-bought birthday cake with the bright yellow icing, macaroons and doughnuts. Her sons surrounded her, Amunet on her lap, as everyone sang 'Happy Birthday.""

It's a new memory, to complement the other birthdays where Stephen would make any kind of cake she asked.

""It's difficult to be away from him,"" she said. ""There's never going to be another man like Steve.""

As Mother's Day loomed, she reflected on what she learned from the man she knew she could spend several lifetimes with and follow the example he set.

""He was very loving and doting and protective and very pure,"" she said. "" ... Co-parenting with him was a piece of cake.""

That they are a strong family and going through life together shows in how the brothers have welcomed Amunet.

""They are very protective of her,"" Tiffany Bannworth said, ""especially (Kipling). They don't want anybody to touch her.""

She will spend her Mother's Day, the first having a daughter, thinking about the man who helped her become a mom and making memories with the six versions of himself he left behind.

""This was a day that Stevie lavished me with gifts and attention,"" she said. He'd take the boys to a thrift store to look for antique glass.

""I have a big collection, but I refuse to spend a lot of money on it,"" she said. ""That used to bug Steve. He liked to buy me expensive things, but I liked the novelty of finding it for next to nothing.

""This year there will be none of that.""

She planned to cook a nice dinner on Saturday, inviting her mother to join them.

She cherishes the memories Stephen left her with, their last morning together and their final embrace.

""Boy, would I kill for another kiss from my husband,"" she said.

327,Tavares dentist preaching the gospel of mouth health,"TAVARES – If you’ve made the drive on U.S. Highway 441 from Tavares into Leesburg, you’ve probably noticed a peculiar billboard.

On it, a woman covers her mouth with both hands and sports worried look on her face.

Next to her is a web address: YourFilthyMouth.com.

Don’t worry, it’s safe for work. The domain name is just a catchy way that local dentist Chuck Reinertsen drives people to the site, where he explains just how much oral health affects overall health.

Spoiler alert: “You cannot have a healthy body without a healthy mouth,” Reinertsen said.

Talking with Reinertsen for just a few minutes reveals his passion for that message, backed up by years of medical research and studies. His website, launched last year, reaffirms it. He co-hosts weekly podcasts with titles like “Surprising facts about your mouth,” “A complete oral exam explained,” and “What to look for in a good dentist.”

“I’m not the expert,” Reinertsen said. “I’m just the messenger.”

He graduated from the University of Florida’s College of Dentistry in 1979. He’s been working in Central Florida for 30 years and has own his practice, LifeTime Dental, in Tavares.

But it wasn’t until fairly recently that he began preaching the critical importance of dental health.

About five years ago, he attended a conference hosted by The American Academy for Oral Systemic Health, “expanding awareness of the relationship between oral health and whole body health.”

“They were connected the dots between the mouth and the body, and it just blew me away,” Reinersten said.

Medical reports, many of them linked on Reinertsen’s site, connect poor oral health to a slew of complications including heart disease, diabetes, strokes, Alzheimer’s disease, pregnancy issues and more.

And it makes sense, Reinertsen says.

“What do you call the build-up on your teeth?” he asks. “Plaque.”

What about buildup on your heart? Also plaque.

“Is this related? Absolutely,” he said. “There’s a huge picture we’re missing. The mouth is the front door to the body.”

Reinertsen said that there’s plenty of attention paid to the “back door” – doctors rightfully prioritize colon health.

“But the bacteria is coming in right here,” he said, pointing to the mouth.

What’s even scarier, Reinertsen said, is that issues like oral cancer and gum disease aren’t really painful. That underlines the importance of consistent oral care because “no pain is not a motivator,” he said.

Reinertsen said that in recent years, he’s felt like Johnny Appleseed, who is said to have traveled across the country planting apple trees. His message, he said, shouldn’t be a controversial one.

“It’s just not what we’re taught,” Reinertsen said.

But he’s gaining traction. Reinertsen is now working on establishing relationships with local physicians in the hopes of providing more complete care for the mouth and the body.

“If you think your mouth isn’t part of your body, when you go to work on Monday, leave your mouth at home,” he said.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190510/tavares-dentist-preaching-gospel-of-mouth-health?rssfeed=true,2019-05-10T05:05:00Z,Daily Commercial,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748
328,"Let facts, not emotion, guide you on mining in Lee County: your say","0509 CARTOON (Photo: Rick McKee, The Augusta Chronicle, GA)

Mining facts

The opponents of mining recently attacked members of the Lee County Board of County Commissioners on their decision to change the county’s mining regulations. They claim these changes will further erode our water quality and cause the proliferation of mines. These claims are made based on misinformation driven by groups pushing an anti-growth agenda.



Here are the facts: these amendments do nothing to increase mining throughout the county or harm water quality. The regulations that have been in place remain the same and require protection of open space, wetlands, wildlife habitat and stringent water monitoring. In fact, most of the proposed changes strengthen the requirements with increased setbacks and additional community meetings for mine approval.

Commissioner Hamman said recently that he had spoken to water experts at all levels of government and academia and found no link between our recent water quality issues and mining.



Commissioners Hamman, Pendergrass and Manning have continuously shown their support of a balanced approach to growth and our environment. They let facts, not emotion, guide good public policy. The facts about mining are there. Do your research and do not be misled by those with a hidden agenda.

An impartial FBI agent or a standby for America's greatest and most dangerous of all-times scandal, coming soon to a TV near you.

John McCuen, Cape Coral

Thank you

Whoever is responsible for making changes to the editorial section deserves a hearty thank you. I am now seeing more guest editors with, gasp, conservative views. And I can't tell you how refreshing it is to see the editorial cartoons express conservative views.

In the bad old days when you had the local cartoon writer doing the cartoons, all he ever did was bash conservatives. Not only did that alienate half of your readers, but the biggest fault of it was that it was boring. You are starting to take the view of famous commentators such as Will Rodgers and Samuel Clements. They realized that there is enough buffoonery, corruption, and ineptitude in both parties, and were able to demonstrate this with clarity and humor.

I am really enjoying reading about the indignation expressed against President Trump. We deplorables are loving it. The latest outrage seems to be alleged lying and firing an investigator. Does anyone remember Clinton getting in front of the camera saying, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman?"" Or his firing of 90 some federal prosecutors his second day in office? Guess there really are two standards.

Totally false

I think The News-Press is shirking its' duty to not correct false statements in the letters published. Recently, a contributor commented on the idea put forward by a new member of the House that income taxes should be raised to 70%. The writer stated that at her salary of $174,000 she would then pay over $121,000 of her salary in taxes and how foolish she must be.

That statement is totally false. The 70% tax plan would be levied on unearned income, such as dividends, and would apply to those individuals with incomes of $25 million or more. Currently, unearned income is taxed at a much lower rate. That is a totally different scenario from what was stated in the letter.

Now, it could be the writer is just ignorant of the plan or perhaps feels they get more bang for the buck with a little misinformation. This is when The News-Press should step in and correct the misinformation.

333,Florida prisons targeted over solitary confinement,"- Florida is an “outlier” in prison systems across the nation when it comes to the use of solitary confinement, according to a 90-page federal lawsuit filed Wednesday that alleges the state Department of Corrections is violating the constitutional rights of inmates.

Attorneys with the Southern Poverty Law Center named the state agency and Secretary Mark Inch as defendants in the lawsuit, which contends state prison officials “discriminate against people with disabilities in its use of isolation” and are “deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm caused” by isolation policies.

Ruthie Michell, the mother of Angel Meddler, who has been in solitary confinement for a cumulative three years, choked up Wednesday at a news conference when she told reporters that her daughter is very depressed and suicidal living in a “cage.”

“She really is just going crazy there,” Mitchell said.

Florida’s prison system is “widely overusing” the practice of solitary confinement to manage inmates, sometimes locking them up in cells that are no bigger than a parking spaces over often-minor infractions, according to Shalini Goel Agarwal, a senior supervising attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Agarwal added that while many states are reducing the use of solitary confinement as a punishment, Florida uses the practice to manage 10 percent of its population, or roughly 10,000 inmates at any given time.

“Despite their knowledge of the risk of harm, defendants (state officials) have no policies to exclude known vulnerable people from isolation, including, but not limited to people with serious mental illness or intellectual disabilities, pregnant women, juveniles, or people with histories of suicide attempts,” the lawsuit said.

Michelle Glady, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman, did not comment on the lawsuit because the department had not been served with the case. But she said the department uses solitary confinement for security reasons or to effectively manage prisons. She added it is only used when “absolutely necessary.”

“Protections are in place to ensure all medical and mental health needs of these inmates are being met. Mandatory visits from security officers, chaplaincy and medical are made routinely to inmates in this level of housing,” Glady said in a statement.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Tallahassee by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Florida Legal Services and the Florida Justice Institute, accuses the department of violating a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Laurette Philipsen, a former inmate who was placed in isolation, told reporters Wednesday that after three days in a room where you can’t determine whether it is night or day, “your mind starts playing games,” and the effects have continued.

“I can’t sleep for more than three hours at a time,” Philipsen said. “At 1 a.m. or 2 a.m., I am awake. By 8 a.m., I am tired and take another three-hour nap. This pattern has not changed.”

Highlighted in the lawsuit are the cases of five inmates, some of whom have been diagnosed with mental illness, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Admire Harvard, a transgender woman who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, has spent nearly 10 years locked up in solitary confinement, according to the lawsuit.

The complaint also points to the case of Jerome Burgess, 46-year-old inmate isolated in Suwannee Correctional Institution. Burgess uses a wheelchair due to paralysis on the left side of his body and cannot urinate without the assistance of a catheter. Attorneys allege he is “losing mobility and range of motion” because there is “no space to ambulate” in the tiny cell where he stays for at least 22 hours a day.

Agarwal said the ultimate goal is to have the state abolish the isolation practice, but the lawsuit is requesting that the court force the department to revise its policies on isolation to “accommodate the needs of people with disabilities and minimize the traumatic impact of isolation,” as soon as “practical.”

Attorneys also point to one detained juvenile, identified by initials J.H., who has cycled in and out of isolation in response to “behavior related to his immaturity and difficulty adapting to prison at such a young age.”

During the 2019 legislative session, which ended last week, Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee, filed a proposal that would have prohibited youths from being placed in solitary confinement except in emergency cases. The bill died in a committee.

334,Lawsuit seeks to end solitary confinement in Florida prisons,"Inmates say solitary confinement is cruel and unusual punishment.

TALLAHASSEE — A half-dozen inmates who in some cases have endured years in solitary confinement filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday demanding the practice stop in Florida prisons, claiming it violates constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.

The lawsuit seeks to be declared a class-action claim on behalf of about 10,000 Florida prisoners held in isolation — about one in 10 state inmates. Florida’s percentage of prisoners in solitary confinement is double the national average, said attorneys for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is representing the six named plaintiffs.

“Solitary confinement is increasingly recognized in the United States and around the world as torture,” said Shalini Goel Agarwal, one of the attorneys who filed the suit in Tallahassee’s federal court. “It can have devastating psychological effects.”

Ruthy Mitchell of Jacksonville, whose daughter Angel Meddler, 21, has been held in isolation at Lowell Correctional Institution Annex for most of the past three-and-a-half years, said it has worsened her daughter’s mental and physical state.

She was placed in solitary three days after arriving behind bars for attempted murder when she refused a correctional officer’s order to do pushups. Meddler continued to be kept in solitary after drawing more disciplinary charges in isolation and since has been put on suicide watch at least a dozen times, the lawsuit maintains.

“It’s hard for her, and it’s hard for me,” Mitchell said, adding, “she’s not a bad person. She’s made mistakes.”

Another former inmate, Laurette Philipsen, 63, of Pasco County, served eight-and-a-half years for grand theft at Lowell, including 28 days in solitary before her release in March 2018. She said the time spent in isolation was her worst experience.

“You have no human contact with anybody,” she said. “You cannot talk to your family. It’s very difficult. And your mind starts playing games after about three days. And then, you don’t know what time of day it is ... nighttime, or daytime. You have nothing to do but be in your cell.”

“After about two weeks, you start considering how to end your life,” she said.

With about 96,000 inmates behind bars, the Florida prison system is the nation’s third-largest. It has struggled with a host of problems, including gang-related violence, a spike in inmate deaths, skyrocketing health costs and difficulty in hiring and retaining correctional officers, leaving some facilities dangerously short-staffed, according to analysts.

A Florida Department of Corrections spokesman responded to Wednesday’s lawsuit with a statement about how solitary confinement is used at state lockups.

“An inmate is placed in close management when the inmate through his or her behavior, has demonstrated an inability to live in the general population without abusing the rights and privileges of others,” said Rob Klepper of Florida DOC.

He added, “There are processes in place to evaluate these inmates and transition them back into general population. Close management is only utilized when absolutely necessary to ensure the safe and secure operation of our institutions.”

Among the inmates named in the lawsuit is a transgender woman in isolation at Florida State Prison, a men’s institution, who has been held in solitary for almost 10 years. Another is a 17-year-old at Suwannee Correctional Institution held in isolation for most of the past three years he has spent behind bars.

Two middle-aged inmates named in the lawsuit also are suffering from severe physical problems along with mental health disorders.

“The Florida Department of Corrections has long known about the harms of solitary confinement, but hasn’t done enough to limit how many people are in isolation or how bad the conditions are there,” said Agarwal.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190508/lawsuit-seeks-to-end-solitary-confinement-in-florida-prisons?rssfeed=true,2019-05-08T14:50:43Z,Sarasota Herald,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

337,Prosecutors say doctor caused patient's fatal overdose,"KEY LARGO, Fla. - A Miami-Dade County doctor was arrested Tuesday after state prosecutors said she illegally prescribed opioid drugs to a patient, resulting in the woman's death.

Dr. Marta Farinas, 48, faces charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic in oxycodone and delivery of oxycodone.

""Doctors are supposed to heal their patients, not feed their addictions,"" Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said in a statement. ""This doctor prescribed opioid substances illegally and in bad faith while conspiring with the victim to traffic and deliver oxycodone.”

In March, Monroe County sheriff's deputies found 35-year-old Leigh Anne Milazzo dead at her home in Key Largo. Milazzo's body was found next to a bottle of oxycodone and Farinas had written the prescription the day before. A toxicology report determined that Milazzo died of an overdose of oxycodone and alprazolam, a sedative sold under the brand name Xanax.

After an investigation involving the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, authorities said they discovered that Farinas and Milazzo conspired to traffic narcotics. Prosecutors said text messages between the two showed Farinas provided prescriptions at Milazzo's request, even delivering the prescription to her home.

Farinas received a portion of the medications after she prescribed them to Milazzo, prosecutors said. She operates a private practice in Miami Gardens.

In May 2018, Farinas' boyfriend died of a drug overdose in Miami-Dade County. During that investigation, authorities interviewed Farinas about her possible involvement in his death, prosecutors said.

On Tuesday afternoon, Farinas was held on $100,000 bond at Miami-Dade County's Turner Guilford Knight Correction Center.

340,"Former Cape Coral resident now leading the ATF, first woman to head the agency","Regina ""Reggie"" Lombardo was sworn-in as the Acting Deputy Director of the agency on Wednesday, replacing retiring Deputy Director Thomas Brandon. (Photo: Special to The News-Press)

The new Acting Deputy Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — the first woman to head the federal agency — has her heart in Southwest Florida despite leading an agency based in Washington, D.C.

Regina Lombardo, 56 and known to everyone as ""Reggie"", looks fondly on her days in Fort Myers and Cape Coral when she worked in her parent's deli, was competitive in high school sports and even modeled hairstyles for a top local stylist.

""It's been a ride,"" she said Tuesday, adding that the first female acting director aspect ""feels really profound.""

Reggie Lombardo said being the first female was never at the forefront of why she was at ATF.

Regina ""Reggie"" Lombardo, a former student in Cape Coral, is the first woman to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. (Photo: U.S. Department of Justice)

""Its an agency that regulates gun laws,"" she said, and not really a place a lot of women generally think of or naturally gravitate to.

""I hope to change that,"" she said. ""I feel humble and proud. I hope to be a role model. You can't be what you can't see.""

Attorney General William P. Barr announced Lombardo's appointment April 24 and she was sworn-in as head of the agency on Wednesday, replacing retiring Deputy Director Thomas Brandon.

In a statement, Barr said Lombardo has proven herself to be an outstanding leader.

""She is well qualified to continue ATF's successes of recent years, including helping the Department investigate and prosecute more firearms offenders than ever before,"" he said.

Lombardo, speaking from ATF headquarters in Washington, D.C., said her heart is usually split between Southwest Florida and New York, where her family originally settled.

""I still fight with that,"" she said. ""I go back to where my family is, where my heart is. When I go back to Fort Myers it makes me feel peaceful. It still feels like home.""

Still, she loves her New York travels.

She also considers her path to the ATF a bit unorthodox, going from a family that had a legitimate liquor business to an agency that targets illicit liquor activities.

The Lombardos have roots that go deep into New York's past — she said one part of the family has the second liquor license issued there — and they operated a wine and liquor business in East Harlem in the 1920s.

""We took out what we knew and brought it to Fort Myers,"" she said.

Her promotion to the top of the ATF came as no surprise to her mom Milly Lombardo, 86, and older sister Rosemarie Lombardo, 63, both of whom still live in Southwest Florida.

""Mom is excited, and proud ... and worried,"" Rosemarie Lombardo said. She then added with a chuckle: ""She's not worried about the criminals, she's worried about Washington D.C.""

Rosemarie Lombardo, oldest of the four Lombardo children, said her little sister was no ballerina type growing up.

""She was rough and tumble,"" she said. ""She was a very hard worker and determined. But she was friendly and sociable too.""

Rosemarie Lombardo said her sister worked at the family business in Cape Coral, Lombardo's Italian Deli and Bakery, which was actually started in New York by their grandparents.

Actually, Reggie Lombardo said, the deli here first opened as an Italian food shop in Fort Myers on U.S. 41 and moved to the larger deli location in Cape Coral in 1979. Her parents closed it at the end of 2000.

""I don't think work (at the deli) was her first passion,"" Rosemarie said. ""It was always there, it wasn't punishment. It was very lighthearted.""

Rosemarie Lombardo said her sister did well working at the deli and was good with the customers and later helped her in a pasta-making enterprise.

That restaurant experience obviously stayed with her, her sister said. ""She is an avid cook,"" she said. ""She knows her food.""

Reggie Lombardo readily agreed.

""One of my passions is to cook,"" she said. ""That's where my creative side comes out.""

Her sister said Reggie Lombardo, along with her brother, Raphael, were also interested in dancing and would serve as hair style models when top local stylist Valentino did hair shows.

""We competed in disco and danced at the Edison pageant,"" Reggie Lombardo said.

Just a year apart in age from her brother, his death in 1996 devastated her.

""It was the greatest heartbreak of my life,"" she said.

Carolyn Rogers of Fort Myers said she and Lombardo went to school together, graduating from Bishop Verot High School in Fort Myers in 1981. She said that Reggie Lombardo was class president one year and was always a leader and a hard worker.

""My heart is full of pride for her today,"" Rogers said.

She remembers when the Lombardos moved to Cape Coral in the 1970s when the new ATF head was in fourth grade and the city was still fairly unpopulated.

""There was no more than 10,000 people living there ... in the early 70s,"" Rogers said.

She said growing up in New York gave Lombardo ""street smarts"" and likely helped her as she rose through the ATF ranks.

Rogers remembered Lombardo working at the family business for a number of years.

""She’s beautiful, kind and amazing,"" she said. ""And quite an athlete in her day.""

Rosemarie Lombardo agreed with Rogers' assessment.

""Sports was her passion,"" she said. ""She was an avid softball player. I think she even played on one of the boys' teams.""

That sports activity helped her as she went to college assisted by a softball scholarship.

She figured out her future in college segueing from education to law and then to law enforcement.

""Not a lot of women wanted to work on bombs and explosives,"" she said. ""It was more of a challenge. That's what triggered me to focus.""

The new director is close to the mandatory retirement age for federal agency workers, 57, but an extension isn't outside the realm of possibilities.

""Whatever role they want me to play,"" she said. ""I am willing, no discussions.""

341,UF football player charged with battery,"Brian Edwards, 20, is accused of grabbing his girlfriend by the neck to stop her from leaving.

Florida junior cornerback Brian Edwards was arrested by Gainesville police Monday and is facing a charge of simple battery/date violence following an altercation with his girlfriend in his apartment.

Edwards and the woman got into an argument, and as she attempted to leave the apartment, Edward grabbed her by the neck to stop her, according to a Gainesville Police Department arrest report. She had marks on her neck and a scratch on her shoulder.

Edwards, 20, and the woman have been dating for two years, according to the report. A witness to the incident intervened in an effort to stop the argument and then called 911.

A simple battery charge is a misdemeanor under Florida law.

Edwards, who is from Miramar, has played in 18 games in his UF career. This past season, he recorded nine tackles, four pass breakups, one quarterback hurry and a fumble recovery.

A nurse at Health First's Holmes Regional Medical Center was arrested Monday afternoon after police said he sexually assaulted a patient in his care last week.



Jose Cruz, 38, of Palm Bay, tried to pass inappropriate touching off as part of an examination May 2, according to arrest reports. Police said Cruz told the patient he was checking her body for lesions or other abnormalities.

The patient was initially being examined by Cruz and a female certified nurse's aide. The patient told police Cruz asked the aide to leave the room to retrieve something. When the aide left, Cruz began to touch the woman inappropriately, police said.

Detectives said Cruz confirmed ""significant portions of the victim's statement"" when interviewed. Cruz told police the exam he gave is commonly referred to as a ""four eyes"" exam, meaning two pairs of eyes are supposed to be on the patient at all times.



He originally told detectives the aide remained in the exam room before changing his story. Investigators said they noted several discrepancies in his story. Cruz initially said he didn't touch the patient inappropriately before describing touches that were outside the scope of the normal exam.

At one point during his exam, the woman felt uncomfortable and said she questioned his actions.



Cruz replied by telling her that it was just a routine procedure, police said.



Health First took immediate action after the incident was reported.

“The safety of our customers and associates is a top priority. We are fully cooperating with authorities to assist in the investigation. The associate has been suspended pending the investigation,"" said Pat Guerry, Health First's vice president of communications, in an emailed statement.

Cruz was arrested and charged with sexual battery. He is being held at the Brevard County Jail Complex in lieu of $35,500 bond.

Anyone with information is asked to call Melbourne Police Department at 321-608-6461.

355,"Hunt charged with murder, attempted murder X3 in Cove quadruple shooting","PANAMA CITY — Michael Hunt, the man initially sought as a ""person of interest"" in the April 4 quadruple shooting on Allen Avenue that left one woman dead and three people critically injured is now charged with first-degree murder and three counts of attempted felony murder, Panama City police announced shortly after 3 p.m. today.

Panama City police Friday afternoon announced the arrest of Hunt on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Alexandra “Lexie” Elise Peck, 19. She was one of four people shot late April 4, with three surviving with critical injuries. Hunt is charged with attempted felony murder in each of those shootings. In addition, police have now also charged Hunt with armed burglary of a dwelling and two counts of failure to register as a sex offender.

Hunt has been in custody since April 5, one day after four people were shot in the 100 block of Allen Avenue. He was caught the day after the shooting but until today was charged with Human Trafficking and Sexual Assault from another case, as well as being held without bond for failure to appear on a charge of ""unlawful sex acts with certain minors"" and aggravated assault with a firearm. Hunt actually appeared for that hearing April 1, but disappeared after the prosecutor announced there was a new warrant out for him for sexual battery but a hard copy of it was not on hand.

Three days later the shootings occurred.

The Panama City Police Department has since been working with a bevy of agencies on the case - they maintained the crime scene for a week to gather evidence - which left many in the Cove area frightened and wondering what had actually happened, particularly after Hunt was picked up the day after the shootings but not charged with in connection with them until today.

Police have still released few details about the shootings and did not take any today after issuing the press release. They have said the case is of such a nature that public records laws do not apply to much of the information sought and prevents them from releasing certain details. They have also said the public has provided ""invaluable"" information to investigators.

Hunt, 53 is a registered sex offender, who was set for a hearing April 1 on a new sex charge from last fall. Hunt was at the hearing, but when confusion over a new sex charge brought the hearing to a temporary halt, Hunt was gone when court reconvened and the warrant for sexual battery had been found.

Courtroom video obtained by The News Herald shows Hunt and his appointed attorney at the time standing at one podium and the prosecutor at another.

As the hearing begins at 2:42 p.m., the prosecutor quickly tells the judge, “I believe Mr. Hunt has an active warrant. I was (unintelligible) this morning.”

“A what?” Hunt says, looking back toward the audience in the courtroom.

The judge can be heard a short time later saying, “Yeah, I’m not showing it in (unintelligible) but that doesn’t mean it’s not active.”

The prosecutor then is seen pulling up the information on her smartphone, saying, “A warrant for Michael Harrison Hunt, uh, for sexual battery on a victim under 18.”

Hunt at this point raises his left hand in what looks like a gesture of disbelief.

Hunt’s attorney tells the judge it’s likely just a continuation of the charge Hunt is in court for that day — for which his previously posted $65,000 bond was reduced to a release on his own recognizance bond in November by another judge. Hunt had made his court appearances since then.

“What’s your date of birth, Mr. Hunt?” the judge asks.

“6-1-65, your honor,” Hunt replies.

Using that as a comparison point, the prosecutor a short time later, again using her smartphone, says, “I have it right here” and says that the date of birth matches Hunt’s.

“Alright, well, I’m not going to take any action yet until I see an actual capias has been issued so I’ll wait and see what that is and maybe that will give a chance for Ms. Miron to get with (the prosecutor) to discuss that issue,” the judge says says.

Hunt remains standing by his attorney as the prosecutor asks if they can “just recall the case (when we’ve) sorted it out?”

“You can,” the judge replies. “Mr. Hunt, if you will take a seat and we’ll see if we can get to the bottom of this for you.”

“Yes sir,” Hunt replies, and he is seen walking out of camera range toward the audience, and the door, less than 2 minutes after the hearing started.

Forty-five minutes later the video picks back up with the court clerk calling, “The State recalls Michael Hunt.”

The judge asks Miron to get her client but less than a minute later her voice can be heard from beyond camera range, “It appears Mr. Hunt has vacated the courthouse.”

The judge immediately ruled that Hunt had failed to appear by leaving early and ordered him held without bond, making Hunt a wanted man. The search that ensued turned into an all-out manhunt three days later when four people were gunned down Thursday night in an Allen Avenue home.

Panama City police quickly declared Hunt a “person of interest” in the case and he was located the following evening and taken into custody for failure to appear, but he has not been charged in connection with the shootings.

Police have not said if they think the shootings are related to any of the previous or pending charges against Hunt or why he is a “person of interest” in the case. The scene of the crime remained roped off with crime scene tape Wednesday. In addition to the earlier charges, Hunt, now being held without bond, is facing new charges of human trafficking, living off the earnings of a prostitute and sexual battery no physical force by offender 18 or older, victim greater than 12 years of age/less than 18 years of age.

Hunt previously served prison time from April 3, 2013, until June 1, 2015, for three drug charges — including trafficking — as well as grand theft and living off the earnings of a prostitute, according to Florida Department of Corrections records. Those records also indicate Hunt “qualified” for sexual offender status for a 1990 conviction for “US MILITARY (RAPE) GCMO 16 Us Army, NJ.”

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Sexual Offenders and Predators Search website shows that on Jan. 3, Hunt registered his address as being 2119 E. Fifth St., which is the address for Polecats, a business that advertises on social media as a “Dance Studio & VIP Event Venue.” On social media it appears to have a warehouse-type interior that includes a small stage and dance pole.

According to the Florida Department of State, Division of Corporations, Hunt is listed as the registered agent and manager of POLECATS LLC.

And according to the Bay County Property Appraiser’s Office, that property is owned by 6316 E INDEPENDENCE BLVD, LLC., which, in turn, according to the Division of Corporations, lists its title manager as George Kingston, who owns a number of other properties downtown and in Panama City.

360,Florida sued over prison system's solitary confinement policies,"TALLAHASSEE — Florida is an “outlier” in prison systems across the nation when it comes to the use of solitary confinement, according to a 90-page federal lawsuit filed Wednesday that alleges the state Department of Corrections is violating the constitutional rights of inmates.

Attorneys with the Southern Poverty Law Center named the state agency and Secretary Mark Inch as defendants in the lawsuit, which contends state prison officials “discriminate against people with disabilities in its use of isolation” and are “deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm caused” by isolation policies.

Ruthie Michell, the mother of Angel Meddler, who has been in solitary confinement for a cumulative three years, choked up Wednesday at a news conference when she told reporters that her daughter is very depressed and suicidal living in a “cage.”

“She really is just going crazy there,” Mitchell said.

Florida’s prison system is “widely overusing” the practice of solitary confinement to manage inmates, sometimes locking them up in cells that are no bigger than a parking spaces over often-minor infractions, according to Shalini Goel Agarwal, a senior supervising attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Agarwal added that while many states are reducing the use of solitary confinement as a punishment, Florida uses the practice to manage 10 percent of its population, or roughly 10,000 inmates at any given time.

“Despite their knowledge of the risk of harm, defendants (state officials) have no policies to exclude known vulnerable people from isolation, including, but not limited to people with serious mental illness or intellectual disabilities, pregnant women, juveniles, or people with histories of suicide attempts,” the lawsuit said.

Michelle Glady, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman, did not comment on the lawsuit because the department had not been served with the case. But she said the department uses solitary confinement for security reasons or to effectively manage prisons. She added it is only used when “absolutely necessary.”

“Protections are in place to ensure all medical and mental health needs of these inmates are being met. Mandatory visits from security officers, chaplaincy and medical are made routinely to inmates in this level of housing,” Glady said in a statement.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Tallahassee by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Florida Legal Services and the Florida Justice Institute, accuses the department of violating a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Laurette Philipsen, a former inmate who was placed in isolation, told reporters Wednesday that after three days in a room where you can’t determine whether it is night or day, “your mind starts playing games,” and the effects have continued.

“I can’t sleep for more than three hours at a time,” Philipsen said. “At 1 a.m. or 2 a.m., I am awake. By 8 a.m., I am tired and take another three-hour nap. This pattern has not changed.”

Highlighted in the lawsuit are the cases of five inmates, some of whom have been diagnosed with mental illness, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Admire Harvard, a transgender woman who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, has spent nearly 10 years locked up in solitary confinement, according to the lawsuit.

The complaint also points to the case of Jerome Burgess, 46-year-old inmate isolated in Suwannee Correctional Institution. Burgess uses a wheelchair due to paralysis on the left side of his body and cannot urinate without the assistance of a catheter. Attorneys allege he is “losing mobility and range of motion” because there is “no space to ambulate” in the tiny cell where he stays for at least 22 hours a day.

Agarwal said the ultimate goal is to have the state abolish the isolation practice, but the lawsuit is requesting that the court force the department to revise its policies on isolation to “accommodate the needs of people with disabilities and minimize the traumatic impact of isolation,” as soon as “practical.”

Attorneys also point to one detained juvenile, identified by initials J.H., who has cycled in and out of isolation in response to “behavior related to his immaturity and difficulty adapting to prison at such a young age.”

361,Cruel and unusual? Florida Department of Corrections sued over solitary confinement,"The Florida Department of Corrections is being sued over its use of solitary confinement in a complaint that alleges the state's isolation techniques are cruel and can cause permanent damage.

TALLAHASSEE — Florida is an “outlier” in prison systems across the nation when it comes to the use of solitary confinement, according to a 90-page federal lawsuit filed Wednesday that alleges the state Department of Corrections is violating the constitutional rights of inmates.

Attorneys with the Southern Poverty Law Center named the state agency and Secretary Mark Inch as defendants in the lawsuit, which contends state prison officials “discriminate against people with disabilities in its use of isolation” and are “deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm caused” by isolation policies.

Ruthie Michell, the mother of Angel Meddler, who has been in solitary confinement for a cumulative three years, choked up Wednesday at a news conference when she told reporters that her daughter is very depressed and suicidal living in a “cage.”

“She really is just going crazy there,” Mitchell said.

370,Former FSU QB Wyatt Sexton accused of battering Lyft driver,"Wyatt Sexton was arrested Monday after accusations he hailed a Lyft driver in January and assaulted her during the ride.

The 34-year-old former Florida State University quarterback was booked into the Leon County Detention Facility on charges of battery after an arrest warrant was signed Monday.

He will appear before a judge this morning when his bail will be set.

The ride-share driver picked Sexton up on the morning Jan. 23. At the start of the 11-minute ride, he got in the front seat and began waiving a lighter in the driver’s face and up and down his own body.

The woman told Tallahassee Police investigators she felt uncomfortable but continued the fare. Sexton began yelling and grabbed the woman by the hair and arm as the ride finished, according to court records.

She immediately went to TPD’s headquarters on 7th Avenue to report the incident.

On April 18, she picked him out of a photo lineup.

Police who were familiar with Sexton followed up almost two weeks later. During a phone call, Sexton claimed to know nothing about the incident and denied attacking anyone.

Sexton, who is the son of former FSU running back Billy Sexton, has struggled with legal and health issues in the past. His family has stressed to police investigators he needs mental health counseling. Charges stemming from a 2016 domestic incident were dropped.

Sexton's football career was cut short by personal troubles in 2005 after behavioral issues off the field. He finished spring practice as the starter that year in front of Xavier Lee and Drew Weatherford.

Police found the junior behaving erratically in June 2005 and took him to the hospital for observation. Officers said he appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but he was never arrested.

373,"Hills, hawks and animals on the path to the Tails & Trails half-marathon","Buy Photo Herb Wills, running column. (Photo: Democrat files)

On the east side of Tallahassee, Tom Brown Park, Lafayette Heritage Park, and the Alford Greenway are connected by dozens if not hundreds of miles of trails. Charlie Johnson covered 13.1 miles on those trails in 1:25:32 to win the half-marathon at the 18th annual Tails & Trails on Saturday morning, May 4. Amanda Sava was the first woman in the race, defending her 2018 title in the half marathon with a 1:38:43 and placing seventh overall.

The Animal Shelter Foundation has always hosted the event, starting in 2002 with a 5K race, adding a 10K in 2006 and the half marathon in 2015. Two days before the 2019 Tails & Trails, the longest run was in peril.

“I got a call from the city on Thursday at 4:30,” said Tom Perkins. “There was a hawk attacking people in Lafayette Heritage Park. We were going to have to cancel the race or re-route it.”

It turned out that a very minor change of course satisfied the hawk’s territorial instincts, and the half-marathon started from the Animal Shelter as scheduled at 7:45 a.m., with Jeff Nielsen guiding the runners on the lead bicycle. After the first minute of running, Charlie Johnson was already well ahead of the field. No one, athlete or irate bird, challenged Johnson for the rest of the race.

“I was hoping for a hawk attack,” said Johnson. “Anything to have some excitement out there. It helped to have Jeff Nielsen out there on the bicycle, telling me, ‘OK, there’s a big hill coming up.’”

There are numerous hills on the Tails & Trails half marathon course, which takes the runners in and out of the Lake Lafayette basin before finishing back at the Animal Shelter, atop the ridge that Easterwood Drive runs along. Amanda Sava also noticed those hills.

It was tough!” said Sava. “I ran a lot faster this year. I think I’m in better shape, but I ran a triathlon last week and my legs are still recovering. I’m happy with my race, though. I’ll probably take a little break after this.”

Behind Johnson’s winning 1:25:32, Brad Busboom took second in 1:32:31 and Andrew Theodore third in 1:36:47. Jack McDermott was the first master runner in the half marathon, placing fourth overall in 1:36:47.

Melissa Thompson finished runner-up to Sava in the women's standings, placing sixteenth overall in 1:52:26. Courtney Mason was the third woman and seventeenth overall in 1:53:19. Laura Reina was the first woman master and fifth female finisher, twentieth overall in 1:55:11.

The Tails & Trails 10K started at 8:30, when the fastest half marathon runners were still exploring the Alford Greenway. Pensacola, Florida master runner Jennifer McGranahan was not only the first woman in the race, she was also the overall winner. McGranahan grabbed the lead right after the start, shadowed by Sean Landeta of Thomasville, Georgia. Landeta hung on for the first half of the race, but McGranahan got away after the leaders had turned around for the return trip to the Animal Shelter. 50 meters ahead by the six-kilometer mark, McGranahan finished with a lead of nearly 200 meters and a winning time of 46:08.

“That was fun!” said McGranahan. “I’ll be out there next year. I liked everything that went into this race; the trails, the family discount, the animals. It’s a nice way to find good homes for some animals.”

McGranahan has deep running roots in Pensacola, having raced cross-country and track for Pensacola High before going on to compete for the University of Florida. Currently, she’s working on a degree in physical therapy at Florida A&M University.

“I usually run the Fiesta of Five Flags 10K in Pensacola, and I could have driven back for that,” said McGranahan. “But I thought, ‘No!’ I love Tom Brown Park and the trails.”

Sean Landeta was the first man in the race, coming in second overall in 46:57. Paul Guyas was the first male master, third overall in 47:12. Master runner Tim Unger was third on the men's side and fifth overall in 48:40.

Tim Unger is Lilli Unger’s father, and Lilli Unger was second in the women’s standings.The Leon High cross-country runner placed fourth overall in 47:54. Alyssa Terry finished third in the women's division and seventh overall in 50:04.

The Tails & Trails 5K started at the same time as the 10K. Kurt Dietrich took the early lead in the 3.1-mile race. Having won the 5K in 2017 and 2018, Dietrich was going for a third straight title, but Connor Edwards denied him that. Edwards, an eighth-grader at Swift Creek Middle School, overtook Dietrich then went on to win the race in 19:44. Dietrich was second in 20:00, and Daniel Wurgler third in 20:14. Aaron Guyer was the top master runner in the 5K, placing seventh overall in 21:06.

In the 2015 Tails & Trails 10K Brittney Barnes had been the first woman. In the 2016 Tails & Trails 5K Barnes had been the first woman. In the 2019 5K she was again the first woman, placing ninth overall in 21:38. Amelia Bryant was second to Barnes, placing thirteenth overall in 25:10. Twelve-year-old Liliana Lewis edged Paula O'Neill for the third spot in the women's standings, 25:47 to 25:49. The two were sixteenth and seventeenth overall. O'Neill was the first woman master in the race.

643 athletes crossed the finish line at the 2019 Tails & Trails, with 125 completing the half marathon, 148 the 10K, 302 the 5K, and 68 the one-mile fun run. Gulf Winds Track Club of Tallahassee chip-timed each of the four races.

377,Cape Coral city trip to China in limbo after council members voice concerns,"CLOSE A rundown of who's who in Cape Coral's City Council. Sarah Jarvis/news-press.com

Plans for Cape Coral city officials to travel to China for a cultural and economic development trip are up in the air, after council members voiced concerns Monday about trip details.

A three-person delegation from Baise, China visited the Cape in February as part of an exchange intended to form a sister city relationship between the two cities. City staff initially suggested that a delegation of Cape Coral representatives visit China in late April or early May, but concerns about the cost and nature of the trip have put the plans into question.

City staff has requested a budget of $17,000 for the May 31 - June 7 trip. Council previously approved a $10,000 budget, which covered lodging and some meals for the Chinese delegation's visit.

""Baise has a population of nearly 4 million and offers a host of cultural, economic and trade opportunities for the City of Cape Coral,"" reads a city memo on the proposal.

The main concerns raised by council were a visit to an additional Chinese city that wasn't previously discussed and inclusion of a city staff member that council previously decided against.

Ricardo Noguera, the city's economic development manager, said he added the additional trip to Chengdu, China after the mayor expressed concern that the initial agenda for the Cape delegation's visit didn't include enough time for pursuing economic development opportunities.

“When we looked at the schedule that we had going to Baise, many of the activities looked more cultural,” Noguera said, adding that the mayor then asked him if he had any other contacts in China. “I see it as a worthwhile trip spending one night in Chengdu and the rest of the time in Baise.”

Noguera — who said he previously did business in China to bring about a mixed-use project and four-star hotel in Tacoma, Washington — said the brother of one of his contacts in Shanghai is a high-ranking official in Chengdu who could initiate meetings with government officials and business owners.

“So yes, it increased the cost maybe just a few thousand dollars, but in the long run, I thought we’d get a bigger bang for our buck by doing it,” Mayor Joe Coviello said of adding the Chengdu trip to the proposed itinerary.

District 1 Council Member John Gunter said council decided not to include the mayor's legislative executive assistant, Pearl Taylor, on the trip to China, but determined later that month that she could go if private funding was available.

By late January, the proposed Cape Coral delegation included Coviello, Noguera business recruitment specialist Nita Whaley, Assistant City Manager Connie Barron, Community Development Director Vince Cautero and local business owner JoAnne Killion. Monday's proposal included Coviello, Taylor, Noguera, Cautero and Killion, who initially brought forward the sister city idea and who can serve as a translator.

Whaley said in January that the Chinese delegation coming to the Cape would include six people, but that number shrank to three by the time they visited Cape Coral in February. The delegation included a chairman of the central committee of the Communist Party of China, the director of municipal industrial management and the director of foreign affairs, Gunter said.

During their stay, the delegates from China visited Cape Coral Hospital, Oasis Cape Coral Charter School System, Astro-Durance and Ecological Laboratories, according to a city news release about the visit. They also took a boat tour of the Bimini Basin area provided by Nor-Tech Hi-Performance Boats.

District 7 Council Member Jessica Cosden said that in previous discussions, it was determined that the only cost to the city would be airfare. But with the addition of the trip to Chengdu, costs include visas, ground transportation, hotel, meals and incidentals.

She said she would support the proposal if it didn’t include the Chengdu trip.

“While I appreciate where you’re coming from, that’s not what we approved previously as a council,” Cosden said. “If that’s an important part of it, I wish we had had more information about that ahead of time.”

Coviello said a revised proposal would come forward at a later date, but did not specify when.

379,Symphony Under the Stars will shine again,"Mother's Day tradition at the Ocala Golf Club

It’s all about Mom on Sunday, and one of the best ways to treat her and the whole family is with tickets to the 31st annual Symphony Under the Stars, held at the Ocala Golf Club, 3130 E. Silver Springs Blvd., with the Ocala Symphony Orchestra and Fine Arts for Ocala. Music at the event is set to be hip and fun, with tunes from pop culture and well-known movies. And don’t forget the finale: a massive harmony of fiery fireworks.

“We are so excited about this year, as we are every year,” said Maggie Weakley, administrative coordinator for FAFO, which presents the event with its 25-member volunteer board. “It is a lot of work, but we love it.”

Symphony Under the Stars typically attracts 4,000-5,000 people. Tickets are available at the gate, online and at a handful of local retailers.

“This event has become our way of giving back to the community,” said Karen Hatch, FAFO board member. “Our family looks forward to this evening every year. We enjoy the time together in such a beautiful display of Florida weather, music and fireworks.”

Gates open at 4 p.m. Miranda MADison will warm up the early crowd at 5 p.m. with her bluesy singing style. The orchestra begins its performance at 7 p.m., following the national anthem, in a rendition by Hatch’s daughter, Krista.

This year’s orchestra has something for everyone. Guests will recognize themes from movies such as “E.T.,” “Wonder Woman,” “Braveheart,” “Apollo 13,” “Titanic,” “Grease!” and “Harry Potter.” There will be songs from the Beach Boys, tunes from video games and selections from the musical “Crazy for You.” During the fireworks, look forward to music from “Back to the Future.”

The evening will be broadcasted live on Classic Hits FM-104.7.

“You can bring a blanket, or bring an entire spread of food and drinks,” Weakley said. “Some people really get into their setups with fine china, and their entire families come for a nice meal as they listen to the music and take in the show.”

Parking is available in areas surrounding the Ocala Golf Club, with only VIP and handicapped parking available at the club. FAFO board members and volunteers will help shuttle guests who are unable to walk long distances.

“The VIP is a big deal,” Weakley said. “The menu is wonderful. You’ll get access to prime areas and prime seating. The great thing — if it does rain, which it won’t, the VIP tickets are valid for food and drinks, and some musicians will stay under the tents for a smaller performance.”

Those not in VIP spaces or not packing picnics can grab some grub at food trucks. Look for Curbside Cuisine, Papa Pineapples, Humble Wood Fire, Kona Ice, Brusters and The Krafty Kettle. The Ocala Golf Club will be selling beer and wine.

Dryer sheets may seem like a laundry-day essential — how else are we supposed to keep our clothes soft and static-free? — when in reality, they may be doing more harm than good. Not only are they damaging our wardrobe, but also our health. The Environmental Working Group’s senior research and database analyst, Samara Geller, told Apartment Therapy that dryer sheets contain potentially harmful chemicals called quaternary ammonium compounds.

382,Real Holocaust victim's life 'relived' as millennial on Instagram,"Railway tracks leading to the main gates at Auschwitz II - Birkenau. (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images)

“It’s 1944, and Nazis have conquered most of Europe … They do terrible things to us Jews … I’m about to turn 13 — finally.”

If that wasn’t a common diary entry for every pre-teen Jewish girl during World War II, it was for Eva Heyman, and the creator of a new Instagram account is determined to show what Eva's life was really like, in a way that her peers now could relate to: through Instagram.

Many of us are familiar with Anne Frank, but Eva was also a real person who endured the tragic life of being a Jew in the 1940s.

She began journaling her life on her 13th birthday, Feb. 13, 1944. She died on Oct. 17, 1944, as one of six million Jews killed at the hands of Nazis in the Holocaust.

An Israeli tech executive, Mati Kochavi, created the Instagram account as an innovative way of getting millennials who are attached to their phones and social media to engage in Holocaust education as the last of the survivors are dying out, according to The New York Times.

Kochavi and his daughter, Maya, created the project that went live on Israel’s annual Holocaust Martyrs’ and Heroes’ Remembrance Day.

In 70 short episodes, Eva, played by a British actress, takes followers with her on her Holocaust journey. And these are based on real entries from a real diary by a real girl.

We witness Eva, through the Instagram posts, go from a happy, imaginative and fun-loving young woman to a scared, lost and hopeless girl.

She talks about her crush and wanting to be a news photographer when she grows up.

Then, as she and her best friend are playing one day, before things get really bad, a man walks past them, spits on the ground and mumbles, ""Dirty Jew.""

""I'm surrounded by war, but I'm always seeing the sun."" -- Eva

As we begin nearing the end of Eva's journey, once the Nazis begin to take over her community, her tone changes drastically.

“You are so lucky that you cannot feel what terrible things are happening to us ... I so much want to live,” she says as she cries.

In her last post, Eva is put on a train to Auschwitz.

The project then ends with a glimpse into the life and death of the real Eva Heyman.

Kochavi's project has received a ton of support, including an endorsement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and plenty of Instagram followers (there were 1.6 million followers of the page as of Tuesday).

""What a great idea. 👏 Thank you for this. I am a teacher in Germany and will bring that to my students,"" one Instagram user said.

And another responded to one of the posts, ""I think this is great idea to ensure also the younger generations remembers the holocaust!!!""

But the project has not come without criticism.

Some Israelis say the use of “selfie culture” and the use of hashtags and emojis to try to simulate life during the Holocaust is cheapening and trivializing that period of history.

Regardless, Kochavi said he spent several million dollars on the project because the Holocaust needs attention from today's youth.

“The memory of the Holocaust outside of Israel is disappearing,” Kochavi said in an interview with The New York Times. “We thought, 'Let’s do something really disruptive.' We found the journal and said, ‘Let’s assume that instead of pen and paper, Eva had a smartphone and documented what was happening to her.’ So we brought a smartphone to 1944.”

After searching through about 30 young people's journals from the Holocaust, Kochavi and his daughter chose to tell Eva's story because of something very ""modern and relatable"" to her.

""I have no doubt in my mind that young people around the world want to have serious content and be connected in the right way,” he said.

383,State prisons sued over solitary confinement,"TALLAHASSEE — Florida is an “outlier” in prison systems across the nation when it comes to the use of solitary confinement, according to a 90-page federal lawsuit filed Wednesday that alleges the state Department of Corrections is violating inmates' constitutional rights.

Attorneys with the Southern Poverty Law Center named the state agency and Secretary Mark Inch as defendants in the lawsuit, which contends state prison officials “discriminate against people with disabilities in its use of isolation” and are “deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm caused” by isolation policies.

Ruthie Mitchell, the mother of Angel Meddler, who has been in solitary confinement for a cumulative three years, choked up Wednesday at a news conference when she told reporters that her daughter is very depressed and suicidal living in a “cage.”

“She really is just going crazy there,” Mitchell said.

Florida’s prison system is “widely overusing” the practice of solitary confinement to manage inmates, sometimes locking them in cells no bigger than a parking space over often-minor infractions, according to Shalini Goel Agarwal, a senior supervising attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Agarwal added that while many states are reducing the use of solitary confinement as a punishment, Florida uses the practice to manage 10 percent of its population, or roughly 10,000 inmates at any given time.

“Despite their knowledge of the risk of harm, defendants (state officials) have no policies to exclude known vulnerable people from isolation, including, but not limited to people with serious mental illness or intellectual disabilities, pregnant women, juveniles, or people with histories of suicide attempts,” the lawsuit said.

Michelle Glady, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman, did not comment on the lawsuit because the department had not been served with the case. But she said the department uses solitary confinement for security reasons or to effectively manage prisons. She added it is only used when “absolutely necessary.”

“Protections are in place to ensure all medical and mental health needs of these inmates are being met. Mandatory visits from security officers, chaplaincy and medical are made routinely to inmates in this level of housing,” Glady said in a statement.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Tallahassee by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Florida Legal Services and the Florida Justice Institute, accuses the department of violating a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Laurette Philipsen, a former inmate who was placed in isolation, told reporters Wednesday that after three days in a room where you can’t determine whether it is night or day, “your mind starts playing games,” and the effects have continued.

“I can’t sleep for more than three hours at a time,” Philipsen said. “At 1 a.m. or 2 a.m., I am awake. By 8 a.m., I am tired and take another three-hour nap. This pattern has not changed.”

Highlighted in the lawsuit are the cases of five inmates, some of whom have been diagnosed with mental illness, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Admire Harvard, a transgender woman who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, has spent nearly 10 years in solitary confinement, according to the lawsuit.

The complaint also points to the case of Jerome Burgess, a 46-year-old inmate isolated in Suwannee Correctional Institution. Burgess uses a wheelchair due to paralysis on the left side of his body and cannot urinate without the assistance of a catheter. Attorneys allege he is “losing mobility and range of motion” because there is “no space to ambulate” in the tiny cell where he stays at least 22 hours a day.

Agarwal said the ultimate goal is to have the state abolish the isolation practice, but the lawsuit is requesting that the court force the department to revise its policies on isolation to “accommodate the needs of people with disabilities and minimize the traumatic impact of isolation,” as soon as it's “practical.”

Attorneys also point to one detained juvenile, identified by initials J.H., who has cycled in and out of isolation in response to “behavior related to his immaturity and difficulty adapting to prison at such a young age.”

During the 2019 legislative session, which ended last week, Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee, filed a proposal that would have prohibited youths from being placed in solitary confinement except in emergencies. The bill died in committee.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190508/state-prisons-sued-over-solitary-confinement?rssfeed=true,2019-05-08T12:34:16Z,Ocala.com,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471
385,Prosecutors say Robert Kraft's attorneys intentionally made 'false statement of fact' in sex spa case,"CLOSE SportsPulse: USA TODAY Sports' A.J. Perez breaks down the numerous developments in the Robert Kraft case. USA TODAY

Prosecutors are seeking criminal contempt charges against two of Robert Kraft’s lawyers over their courtroom conduct in defending the New England Patriots owner against soliciting prostitution charges, according to a court filing Tuesday in Florida.

Palm Beach County state attorney Dave Aronberg alleges that Kraft attorneys William Burck and Alex Spiro intentionally made “a false statement of fact” during a motion to suppress hearing May 1.

That hearing dealt with video obtained by police in Jupiter from inside the Orchids of Asia Day Spa that Kraft and other men allegedly patronized. The contempt request comes as Judge Leonard Hanser is expected to rule on the admissibility of the evidence any time.

CLOSE A seldom used ""sneak and peek"" warrant was used to install hidden cameras in the massage parlors involved in the Florida sex spa scandal. Now the question is: Will the videotaped evidence hold up in court? Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

Burck told USA TODAY Sports that the allegations are “ridiculous, false and laughable.”

“Alex and I and our law firm, Quinn Emanuel, will not be intimidated by the state attorney for Palm Beach County,” Burck said. “This is amateur hour. Nobody goes and threatens criminal contempt against lawyers in a case asking questions of a witness.”

Aronberg's office did not immediately return messages left by USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday.

Kraft, 77, pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution.

The request to hold the two lawyers in criminal contempt focused on Spiro’s examination of Jupiter police officer Scott Kimbark. Kimbark stopped many of the 25 men charged and initially identified Kraft on Jan. 19 after he left the spa as a passenger in a Bentley.

Along with a bid to suppress the video footage, Kraft's attorneys have argued police did not have probable cause to stop Kraft.

""Did you say, jokingly or not, that you would, 'make some (expletive) up?' "" Spiro asked Kimbark about another stop on Jan. 19.

""I'm sure I say a lot of things that are captured on body-worn camera, however, I do not remember specifically saying that,” Kimbark responded. “As it seems like it's a home run on your side, I would (not) have (brought) that profane word up.""

Prosecutors wrote in the filing that “a review of the radio transmissions and the body worn camera video conclusively show that Officer Kimbark never made the inflammatory remark.”

“Both Attorneys Spiro and Burck represented to the Court that they had watched the body camera tape and heard this comment allegedly made during a previous stop,” the state attorney wrote in the filing. “Either the assertion that they had reviewed the tape was untrue, or their representation of what occurred during the tape was untrue.”

Burck told USA TODAY Sports they have evidence that Kimbark made the remark and will submit it Wednesday.

“We will have a full explanation of the evidence to show everything Alex asked about and it will back up what he said in court,” Burck said.

Florida statutes don’t specifically lay out punishments for direct or indirect criminal contempt, although they can include jail, a fine and could impact a lawyer’s license to practice.

""It also raises issues not only as to whether or not they have their permission to appear revoked, but whether they can any longer represent Kraft, since the judge will be determining whether or not they were in contempt,"" former Assistant U.S. Attorney David S. Weinstein told USA TODAY Sports.

Heather Reid, 26, was arrested Monday after the Leon County Sheriff’s Office was dispatched at about 11 a.m. to her home in the 4700 block of Crossway Court, according to an LCSO news release.

When deputies arrived, they found the toddler seriously injured and she was taken to the emergency room where she is still being treated. Reid told deputies the child’s injuries were caused by a fall, but her condition did not match her mother’s story.

LCSO Special Victims Unit detectives were called to the hospital and probable cause was established for the arrest of Reid and 23-year-old Clayton Pafford, who was not at the home when deputies arrived.

LCSO deputies, along with members of the U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force and the Florida Highway Patrol, searched for Pafford all night. He was finally located at about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday driving on Back Forest Road by a member of LCSO’s Special Projects Investigations Detection Enforcement Response Unit and members of the Florida Highway Patrol. When they tried to stop him, Pafford refused to stop and fled.

Persuing deputies and troopers used stop sticks in the southbound travel lane of Old Woodville Highway, but Pafford swerved toward the deputy onto the St. Marks bike trail, narrowly missing him. Pafford turned back onto Old Woodville Highway and crossed over Bob Miller Road before troopers were able to stop his vehicle, LCSO reported.

Pafford, who had a passenger in his vehicle, refused to surrender. A LCSO K9 was used to take him into custody and after being treated at a local hospital was taken to the Leon County Detention Facility.

ATLANTA (AP) - Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Tuesday signed into law one of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws, a measure that bans the procedure once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant.

Kemp, a Republican, said he approved the bill ""to ensure that all Georgians have the opportunity to live, grow, learn and prosper in our great state.""

The signing caps weeks of tension and protests at the state Capitol and begins what could be a lengthy and costly legal battle over the law's constitutionality. But a legal showdown is exactly what supporters want.

""We will not back down,"" Kemp said. ""We will always continue to fight for life.""

Anti-abortion activists and lawmakers across the country have been energized by the new conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court that includes President Donald Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. They are pushing abortion bans in an attack on the high court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion nationwide until a fetus is developed enough to live outside a woman's uterus.

Staci Fox, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast, said she had one message for Kemp: ""We will see you, sir, in court.""

At a news conference on the Capitol steps, she said the new law criminalizes doctors for providing lifesaving care. The organization vowed to campaign to unseat the lawmakers who supported it, saying they would ""be held accountable for playing politics with women's health.""

The legal director of the ACLU of Georgia, Sean Young, has said that the group is preparing a legal challenge.

""Under 50 years of Supreme Court precedent, this abortion ban is clearly unconstitutional,"" Young said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. ""Every federal court that has heard a challenge to a similar ban has ruled that it's unconstitutional.""

Under current law, women in Georgia can seek an abortion during the first 20 weeks of a pregnancy. If it's not blocked in court, the new ban would take effect Jan. 1.

The measure makes exceptions in the case of rape and incest - if the woman files a police report first - and to save the life of the mother. It also would allow for abortions when a fetus is determined not to be viable because of serious medical issues.

In addition, the bill includes provisions for alimony, child support and even income tax deductions for fetuses, declaring that ""the full value of a child begins at the point when a detectable human heartbeat exists.""

The bill's author, Republican Rep. Ed Setzler, called it a ""common sense"" measure that seeks to ""balance the difficult circumstances women find themselves in with the basic right to life of a child.""

But Democratic Sen. Jen Jordan said ""there's nothing balanced about it: It's an all-out abortion ban.""

Jordan said she is particularly worried that the new law will push obstetricians away from practicing in Georgia, worsening health care outcomes for women in a state that already has one of the nation's worst maternal mortality rates.

""It's about the unintended consequences,"" Jordan said. ""They're making policy choices that are going to end up causing women to die, and they're preventable deaths.""

Some abortion providers have already faced negative effects from the bill, according to Wula Dawson, director of development and communications for the Feminist Women's Health Center, an abortion clinic in Georgia.

Dawson said anti-abortion protesters outside their clinic have become ""bolder and more aggressive"" toward patients.

In the first few months of 2019, ""heartbeat"" abortion bans have been signed into law in four states: Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio, and now Georgia. Lawmakers in some other states, including Tennessee, Missouri, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Louisiana and West Virginia, are considering similar proposals. A bill that recently passed the Alabama House would outlaw abortions at any stage of pregnancy, with a few narrow exceptions.

Kentucky's law was immediately challenged by the ACLU after it was signed in March, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, about 33,000 abortions were provided in Georgia in 2014.",http://www.wfla.com/news/national/georgias-republican-gov-kemp-signs-early-abortion-ban/1986065713,2019-05-07T17:16:41Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
391,Men face felony murder charges in fatal shooting outside McDonald's,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - Two men have been arrested in connection with a shooting outside a McDonald's last month that left a man dead and a woman injured, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies announced Tuesday morning the arrests of Shaddrick Wright, 20, and Deon Justice, 19, on first-degree felony murder charges.

The shooting happened April 25 at 12:14 a.m.outside the fast-food restaurant on North Pine Hills Road.

The victim, 19-year-old Jamario Dixon, and his brother went to the McDonald's to sell a gun to Justice, documents show. Justice and Wright both shot at the vehicle Dixon was in, hitting him in the shoulder, according to the report.

Deputies said surveillance video showed Justice and Wright running away after the shooting. At least nine shots were fired, the report said.

Dixon's brother drove him to Orlando Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

Wright's 19-year-old girlfriend, who was driving the Volkswagen Jetta in which the two suspects arrived, was also shot in the back of the head during the shooting, records show.

Deputies said Wright moved her from the driver's seat to the passenger's seat then drove her to his mother's house and his mother drove her to ORMC. The story Wright provided deputies did not match with the surveillance video and forensic evidence recovered from the scene, the report said.

Both men are being held at the Orange County Jail without bond.

392,Investigation underway after shocking video shows officer body slamming woman,"Advertisement Investigation underway after shocking video shows officer body slamming woman Share Shares Copy Link Copy

The Rio Vista Police Department launched an internal investigation after cellphone videos surfaced showing an officer body slamming 31-year-old Cherish Thomas to the ground.Police Chief Dan Dailey said the investigation is looking into whether the officer used excessive force during a traffic stop. The incident began as a routine traffic stop along Harris Drive on Sunday evening. Officers stopped a car for suspended registration, Dailey said. They detained all four people inside the car because officers said they refused to the exit the vehicle, preventing the officers from impounding the car. Thomas' family said they had the proper documentation and the officers refused to review it. One of the passengers, Tyrone Clayton Jr., called his relatives to come to the scene in order to record the incident on their cellphones for transparency. “Just being pulled over, I fear for my life every time as an African American in Rio Vista,” Clayton said. Clayton’s stepsister, Cherish Thomas, and his stepmother, Deshaunna Payne, arrived on the scene and started recording the incident on their phones. “I have four kids in that car,"" Payne said. ""I wanted to make sure they were OK.""Dailey said Thomas and Payne obstructed the investigation. Officers said Thomas pushed one of them as Payne tried to hit the other officer. Dailey said that is when the officer tackled Thomas to the ground.“(The) officer tackled her to the ground in order to gain control of her while his partner stepped in to take Deshaunna Payne into custody,” Dailey said in a news release.Thomas said she did not push the officer. “What can I do at this point? He’s a police officer. And I’m (120 pounds),"" she said. ""So what am I going to do? Fight him? No.""Payne said she was not being aggressive toward the officers. “I wasn’t trying to attack them. He slammed my baby,"" she said. ""I went in mother mode to protect my child.""Thomas returned home after going to the hospital on Monday. She said the officer slammed her head into the ground. She said she has suffered from headaches, sore legs and arms since the arrest. “I was scared. I’m not going to lie. Because at the end of the day, that’s a police officer, and they can do what they want to do,” she said.Her family says they want justice. “I want to see the same aggressive action that he took with my child done to him. Yes, I would like to see him fired,” Payne said. According to police, Thomas and Payne have been charged with resisting arrest and obstructing an investigation. Dailey said the family’s videos only show a portion of the incident and he plans to release the officers’ body camera videos by the end of the week to “show the totality of this situation.”Dailey said a third car arrived on the scene with more family members who were “confrontational and uncooperative.” He said officers had to request assistance from the Solano and Sacramento County sheriff offices to deal with the crowd. He added that two other relatives who were detained during the traffic stop tried to escape the patrol car by kicking the door and window. They were charged with felony vandalism.",https://www.wesh.com/article/investigation-underway-after-shocking-video-shows-officer-body-slamming-woman/27390518,2019-05-07T13:21:00Z,WESH-TV,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789

394,Fishing line tied across bike path in Ormond Beach slices man's throat,"ORMOND BEACH, Fla. - A couple riding bikes in Central Park in Ormond Beach said a fishing line was tied across the path and sliced the man's throat.



""I thought it was a spider web. It was literally burning,"" he said. For what it was, I'm lucky to walk away.""



The couple declined to reveal their identity in fear of retaliation but they showed News 6 pictures of what the man's throat looked like yesterday and where they found the line, tied from a fishing dock to a tree at the Joyce Ebbins Fishing Pier and Observation Deck.



""He literally could have been decapitated. If we were going faster like we normally do and it wasn't raining,"" said the woman. ""There's no way this could have been somebody's fishing line that got hung up on the dock and they just walked with it because it would be laying on the ground. It was strung up around neck height on purpose.""



The couple notified Ormond Beach police who are now investigating the incident.

The woman said it hasn't stopped them from riding their bikes on Monday, but said they'll be extra careful and warns others to be as well.



""If you're out here just be vigilant and keep your eyes out. You don't know what's out there,"" she said.

395,Former inmates say jail cell looked like murder scene after inmate forced to give birth alone,"POMPANO BEACH, Fla. - Two women who say they heard another inmate in agony as the inmate was forced to give birth by herself in a Broward County jail cell spoke with Local 10 News about what they witnessed.

Local 10 News reporter Layron Livingston spoke with both women days after they were released from jail.

They said they were in an area with other pregnant women, including 34-year-old Tammy Jackson, and were terrified by what they heard and saw, adding that someone should be held accountable.

""It was horrendous -- the worst experience ever. I hope I never ever hear or see anything like that ever again,"" one woman said.

""What happened was completely inhumane,"" another woman said.

Both former inmates, who will be referred to as witness 1 and 2, asked to remain anonymous. They both said they were housed with other pregnant women in April at the North Broward Bureau in Pompano Beach, where Jackson gave birth.

""The way it's set up, it's all glass, so you can see and hear everything,"" witness 1 said.

Relatives said Jackson suffers from bipolar schizophrenia. We're told she was moved into a neighboring isolation cell the night before she gave birth alone in that same cell.

""She started telling them she was in labor and she was having pains,"" witness 1 said.

""Telling whom?"" Livingston asked.

""The staff and the deputies,"" the woman said.

""I remember, at one point, a bunch of nurses and deputies were over at her isolation cell,"" witness 2 told Livingston.

""Obviously, when your water breaks, it's a big mess,"" witness 1 said. ""They opened up the cell door, got her new clothes and blankets, allowed her to change. She continued to voice that she was in labor. They told her, 'Don't worry about it. It's going to be a long time,' closed the door back and left her.""

""And she was screaming, like, bloody murder. Like screaming all night long,"" witness 2 said.

""It was horrible just to hear it and not be able to help someone, but in that situation, there's nothing we could do,"" witness 1 said.

According to an incident report, an officer saw Jackson in her cell the next morning ""squatting and screaming"" in pain.

The officer then heard a baby crying and saw Jackson standing with her baby in her arms, the report stated.

""Everyone's screaming. We're banging on the glass and screaming. As soon as they saw that, they made everybody get away from the window,"" witness 1 said.

The women said they later saw medics rush in to take Jackson and her baby to a hospital. A crew was also brought in to clean the cell, they said.

""It looked like someone was murdered in there,"" witness 1 said.

""I can't even imagine, and she didn't even have anyone to hold her hand,"" witness 2 said.

The former inmates said they hope Jackson gets justice for what she went through at the jail.

396,Deputies: Man claims demons made him batter pregnant woman in Hudson,"HUDSON, Fla. (WFLA) - A Pasco County man who was arrested for battering a pregnant woman claims demons took over his body and made him do it, deputies say.

Pasco deputies arrested 26-year-old Matthew Douglas Saturday night at his home in Hudson.

Deputies were called to the home around 10:30 to investigate a domestic battery call. When they got to the scene, deputies say Douglas refused to cooperate and wouldn't state his name.

Douglas was detained and put in the back of a patrol car. He later provided his name and admitted he didn't want to cooperate originally because he knew there was a warrant out for his arrest, deputies say.

According to the arrest report, Douglas told deputies demons took over his body and made him black out. He said that may have led him to become physical with his the pregnant woman, deputies noted in the report.

The victim, who is 18 weeks pregnant, told deputies she was playing Xbox Saturday night when Douglas told her to go to sleep. Douglas turned the game system off, but the victim turned it back on.

That's when the victim says Douglas grabbed her around the neck and started to choke her, the arrest report says. The victim told deputies she couldn't breathe and was scared. Deputies noted in the arrest report that the victim had a small area of bruising on her neck and three long scratch marks.

Douglas was charged with domestic aggravated battery on a pregnant female. He was taken to the Land O' Lakes Detention Center.",https://www.wfla.com/news/pasco-county/deputies-man-claims-demons-made-him-batter-pregnant-woman-in-hudson/1982926904,2019-05-06T14:56:16Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

Belinda Boyles, 49, is accused of stealing more than $53,700 using the credit cards of her workplace and co-workers at Agri Products Incorporated.

Boyles, who worked at the company for 10 years, is charged with 34 counts of forgery, one count each of use of the identity of another person, grand theft of more than $20,000, illegal use of a credit card and two counts of use of the identification of another person without consent.

She was released Saturday from the Leon County Detention Facility after posting $15,800 bail.

The president of the company reported to the Tallahassee Police Department that one of his employees’ company credit cards was declined. The pending charges that caused the card to be declined were linked back to Boyles, who admitted to the president that she’d made fraudulent purchases.

“Boyles told him she could not recall when she had begun using the company credit cards or how much she spent, but admitted to doing it and to making changes to the billing statements which she reviewed and turned in,” TPD investigators wrote in their report.

Boyles was responsible for reviewing credit card statements for the company. To hide the purchases, she would alter the statements by removing the charges completely, change the amount or change the name of the vendor, according to TPD.

In all, she altered 34 bank statements.

Between 2014 and 2018, she made multiple charges to Walmart, a Valdosta catering company for a reception, Double Tree Hotel, Bass Pro Shops as wells as satellite radio and cellphone accounts.

Investigators attempted to contact Boyles so they could interview her. Her attorney John Leace advised she would not make a statement to police.

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office said they arrested Robert Walls despite his attempt at disguise.

The sheriff's office says in a statement that when agents caught up with Walls last Thursday to arrest him, he admitted that he was using the wig as a disguise to elude them.

The sheriff's office says he was wanted by a fugitive task force seeking suspects from a major drug investigation that led to arrest warrants for more than 100 defendants.

Online court records show no attorney listed for Walls. He faces charges of solicitation to sell a controlled substance and criminal conspiracy.

404,Interim Polk Fire Rescue chief selected to replace Stravino,"Robert Weech, deputy fire chief of logistics and special services for Polk County Fire Rescue, was tapped to lead the beleaguered department a day after Chief Tony Stravino announced he was retiring in 30 days.

BARTOW — A county deputy fire chief has been named interim chief of the department.

Robert Weech, deputy fire chief of logistics and special services for Polk County Fire Rescue, was tapped to lead the beleaguered department a day after Chief Tony Stravino announced he was retiring in 30 days.

Weech, 52, started at Polk County Fire Rescue in February 2017.

County Manager Jim Freeman, who is retiring in August, said incoming County Manager Bill Beasley will make a decision on a permanent hire after he leaves. Neither Weech nor Beasley, currently the deputy county manager who oversees infrastructure, could be reached for comment.

The new chief will face challenges in the wake of a critical outside report that pointed to numerous problems in the department, including a high turnover rate in one of the fastest-growing areas in the country.

County Commissioner George Lindsey said he suspects Weech will be in charge for several months before Beasley decides whether he will permanently appoint him or conduct a search.

Weech started his firefighting career at the city of Deerfield Beach in 1999 and rose through the ranks to become assistant chief of administration in 2008.

When that agency merged with other operations, Weech served as division chief of finance and was later promoted to assistant chief of operations.

Before becoming a firefighter, Weech was a certified public accountant for a large international accounting firm. He has an accounting degree from Florida State University and a master’s degree in Organizational Development from Upper Iowa University.

If Weech is the permanent selection, he will likely oversee some big changes in the department. A report released by Emergency Services Consulting International showed a number of errors that occurred during the response to a Nov. 23 fire on Rockridge Road in North Lakeland that left a 76-year-old woman dead. Lorretta Pickard died speaking with a 911 operator as she waited for more than 20 minutes to be rescued.

Lindsey said during the next public meeting he plans to instruct staff to ask fire officials to begin constructing a timeline of how the county can achieve the recommendations made by the consulting group. There were recommendations from 24 key findings in the 250-page report. A number are centered around a lack of staffing.

""I want to get a realistic expectation of the accomplishments and a dollar figure on them so the board can begin to tackle these issues,"" Lindsey said.

Some of the more important issues could be expensive, including offering firefighters more money so they will stay at the department rather than leave for neighboring counties.

""We can't be this training ground for other departments,"" Lindsey said. ""We have to be competitive.""

Lindsey said the county is on the right track with plans for new fire stations and investments in other assets, such as tools and trucks.

405,Port St. Lucie widow climbs for a cure and awareness about rare cancer,"A local woman will hike the highest peak in the northeastern United States in memory of her husband, a retired Martin County Sheriff’s deputy, who passed away from a deadly, rare form of blood cancer.

“I’m going to Mount Washington in New Hampshire,” said Lauren Arango, a mother of two.

Arango will be part of a 22-person team of patients, nurses, caregivers and doctors to raise funds and awareness for Multiple Myeloma, an incurable disease that affects your bones.

Moving Mountains for Multiple Myeloma is a collaboration between CURE Media Group, Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation and Celgene.

“My mission is to honor a great husband,” said Arango, a retired nurse.

Her late husband, Richard Arango, worked for the Martin County Sheriff’s Office for 25 years.

The West Virginia native was an avid guitar player and enjoyed the outdoors with his wife of 32 years.

“It’s sad. I was looking forward to 60, 70 years, but God didn’t want it that way,” Arango said.

His battle began in 2010, shortly after his retirement.

“I’m a nurse and I tried to go everywhere, trying to get an answer of that pain in his ribs, nobody couldn’t find anything, not even testing,” Arango said.

Then, five years later, doctors diagnosed him with the cancer she says it’s on the rise.

“By the time they found and did the full diagnosis, he's in stage 3,” Arango said.

According to the National Cancer Institute, this disease gives 50 percent of patients less than five years to survive.

Richard Arango only lasted three.

“A very complex disease that not too many, even health care professionals, recognize,” Arango said.

Symptoms are hard to spot in the initial stages.

“He had multiple tumors in his bones, his kidneys were shut down,” Arango said.

Though some patients can manage symptoms and life expectancy can be extended using treatments, continued research funding is needed to reach the ultimate goal of finding a cure.

“What kept us going is that he always had a smile on him,” Arango said.

It’s why Arango will join the Moving Mountain initiative, so that nobody has to relive her nightmare.

“Our common goal is to not allow other people to go through what we went through and give hope to those who are battling Multiple Myeloma,” she said.

The climb will be taking place on June 28-30.

You can help find a cure by donating.

Arango said 100 percent of the proceeds goes to cancer research.",http://cw34.com/news/local/port-st-lucie-widow-climbs-for-a-cure-and-awareness-about-rare-cancer,2019-05-09T02:19:12Z,WTVX,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407

At New Vision Community outside Apopka, the quiet work of the church and seminary continues under the image of light while a shadow of unnerving questions still looms from a murder investigation that began nearby. Several days after the bodies of two women were found on the church's property, detectives are still working to answer why they were killed and who is behind it. Only one of the victims has been identified, Kristina Upchurch. She was 34 years old. As work continues to identify the other woman found there, a report from the Sheriff's Office gives a glimpse at how the homicide case started.The document describes how landscapers, a father and son team who tend to the property, first made a gruesome discovery. The father and son were working on the church's lawn as they usually do, according to an incident report, and as they mowed toward the end of the property toward a tree line, they noticed a blue tarp set at the edge of it. The tarp seemed amiss immediately, so they stopped their work to see what it was and why it was there.The Sheriff's Office report notes the men saw one of the bodies when they peered behind the tarp used to shroud it. They told deputies they immediately told church staff members, who then called 911.Now several days after this 40-acre plot was scoured for clues, deputies haven't said how the women were killed or what, if any, leads have materialized toward possible motives or suspects.As their investigation first began, deputies said the victims' bodies did show some signs of decomposition. So far, no timeline has emerged detailing when the killings took place. Deputies are asking anyone with information to contact the Sheriff's Office or call Crimeline at 1-800-423-TIPS.",https://www.wesh.com/article/docs-slain-women-were-wrapped-in-tarp-left-behind-church/27397979,2019-05-07T22:24:00Z,WESH-TV,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789
409,Rent in Titusville and Melbourne,"Every year at this time – the end of the theatrical season – Steven J Heron, artistic director of the Titusville Playhouse (TPI), and now the Henegar Center, engages in a bit of self-indulgence. It comes in the form of plays that give audiences the chance to see what local actors can do with drama.

They are plays Heron loves, and no play does he love better than “Rent.” It will be presented May 10 through June 7 at the Emma Parrish Theatre, and June 7 through 16 at the Henegar. This year, having spent the last several months commuting between downtown Titusville and downtown Melbourne, said self-indulgence is more than warranted.

“It’s been hectic because we’re spread so thin,” he said, referring to TPI staffers who have joined him in going from one theater to the other. “Once we get this season finished, things should be better.”

Still, for Heron, things cannot be better than “Rent.” The Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning musical based on “La Boheme” in this case the story of young Bohemians living in New York City that addresses poverty, art, love and AIDS.

‘“Rent’ was the first show I ever became obsessed with,” Heron said. “I saw it 15 times with the original cast and I saw it Off-Broadway before it moved uptown.”

It “changed the face of Broadway,” he added. “I don’t think we’d have ‘Hamilton’ if we did not have ‘Rent.”

It also is personal.

“When I moved to New York in 1992, being from the South, I was the one who was . . . different, and so it appealed to me, as it did to so many others,” he said. “It was my generation’s ‘Spring Awakening,’ my generation’s ‘South Pacific.’ But more important, it meant so much because, having had the experience of friends suffer and pass away from AIDS. When I lived in New York, gay society was dealing with it better than anyone else.”

Heron, who never has tested positive for HIV, dealt with it directly, as a volunteer at the famed David Geffen Center for HIV Prevention and Health Education.

""Rent"" moves from Titusville Playhouse to The Henegar Center in Melbourne on June 7. (Photo: Photo by Niko Stamos)

“We did whatever was necessary, and they would pair volunteers with patients. I learned a lot there,” he said.

Still, what a generation that cannot remember or fail to understand the significance of the AIDS crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s – people of the age to portray characters in “Rent” – bothers him.

“They really don’t realize how pervasive it was, how destructive,” he said softly. “An entire generation of artists was lost.”

“Rent” at TPI and Henegar elicits anything but sadness, though. Heron, always ebullient, is nothing short of elated about how it is working out.

“Are people excited about this?” he asked. “We had 96 people audition for the show, which has a cast of 15. It is incredible.”

The cast, he called, “freaking spectacular. They came in with a sense of the show because they’re so familiar with it.”

Little will change after the show moves to Henegar, either; it will have the same cast, the same set, the same almost everything, with a few technical exceptions because of the way Henegar is built. And after its run finishes, Henegar will be a bit different too.

Heron would love to paint the interior of the 99-year-old building, though that may have to wait in favor of other improvements. Orchestra seating will be stripped out and replaced with wider seats; the stage will have been extended.

“We’d love to make changes that our audiences will appreciate because they will be more comfortable,” he said. “Will we lose a few seats? Yes, but people who come to the theater will understand.”

People who come to either theater will understand why “Rent” will close the season too.

“It is just phenomenal,” Heron said. “Everything about it is incredible. Come see ‘Rent.’”

412,FLORIDA DRUG DEALER GETS LIFE SENTENCE: Clay County drug dealer sentenced to life in prison for teen's overdose death,"0 Clay County drug dealer sentenced to life in prison for teen's overdose death

CLAY COUNTY, Fla. - A federal judge sentenced a 34-year-old Clay County drug dealer to life in prison Monday for the death of a woman who overdosed on fentanyl.

Trumaine ""Lucky"" Muller was convicted for distributing a lethal dose of fentanyl that resulted in death in January, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. He was also convicted of other felony drug offenses and possession of a firearm by a felon.

TRENDING:

Muller is one of three men who were arrested in May 2017 in the overdose death of 18-year-old Ariell Brundige, according to the Clay County Sheriff's Office.

Federal prosecutors say Christopher Williams and Tyler Hamilton bought what they thought was heroin from Muller, but it was actually fentanyl.

Williams and Hamilton gave some of the drug to Brundige, who then snorted what she thought was a small dose of heroin, according to court records. Prosecutors says she was a first-time opiate user.

The drug deal happened about 10:30 p.m. on Nov. 9, 2016, according to court records, and Brundige died about 4:45 the next morning.

Deputies bought heroin and furanylfentanyl from Muller during the Sheriff's Office investigation into Brundige's death and later found furanylfentanyl and a loaded gun in a Clay County apartment where he had been living, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Furanylfentanyl is similar to fentanyl but not as potent.

Court records show both Williams and Hamilton pleaded guilty to manslaughter in state court.

Authorities say it's the first time in Clay County that someone has been convicted of murder in a drug overdose death.

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office said they arrested Robert Walls despite his attempt at disguise.

The sheriff's office says in a statement that when agents caught up with Walls last Thursday to arrest him, he admitted that he was using the wig as a disguise to elude them.

The sheriff's office says he was wanted by a fugitive task force seeking suspects from a major drug investigation that led to arrest warrants for more than 100 defendants.

Online court records show no attorney listed for Walls. He faces charges of solicitation to sell a controlled substance and criminal conspiracy.

428,Clermont man guilty of hit-and-run fatality,"TAVARES — David Sheets is guilty of leaving the scene of an accident that claimed the life of pedestrian Aaron Zacharias in 2015, a jury decided after one hour Thursday.

The state argued that it proved four elements necessary for a conviction: that the driver was involved in a crash leaving the scene of an accident; knew he was involved in a crash; knew or should have known that the accident caused injury or death; and that he willfully failed to stop at or near the scene.

Much of the week-long testimony was highly technical, including Highway Patrol investigators talking about the complex mathematical equations used in their crime scene calculations, and a state crime lab analyst who testified that the odds of another person’s blood other than Zacharias’ being on the pickup truck’s broken windshield was 700-billion-to-1, or 100 times greater than the world’s population.

What the jurors did not hear was that Zacharias was a “mama’s boy,” in the words of his mother, Neena Zacharias.

“He was single … humble, loving, kind, a man anyone would like to talk to,” she said. “There was no judgment. He was a greater listener.”

He was the kind of person who would support his friends, no matter what. Unemployed at the time of the accident, he once worked at the Circle K he had walked to that night.

For someone with a gentle spirit, he had an unusual dream: He wanted to be an MMA fighter.

He walked the route down Lakeshore, not even a mile, every night, to lose weight, Neena laughed. He would always buy a bag of spicy potato chips, then walk home to his mother’s house on Priebe Road to play video games.

Defense attorney Kelly Johnson blasted what she called “weak links in the chain,” including a 911 caller’s testimony that he saw a light in the road and stopped to check it out. It was a cell phone with a flashlight app, he said, and he picked it up and used it to survey the scene. However, a later crime scene photo showed the phone lying face down, and it is unclear how the phone ended up in the hands of investigators.

There was also no proof that a flashlight found in the “on” position belonged to Zacharias, she said.

She also suggested that witnesses, including a woman who lived near the crash site, had “perfect times” in their timeline testimony because they had reviewed crash reports.

Assistant State Attorney Jason Nimeth, however, pointed out inconsistencies in Sheets'original statement to Florida Highway Patrol and a recorded report he made to his insurance company a month later.

Sheets claimed he thought he hit a deer, like the time he hit one on a country road in Georgia in 2008 or 2009. He said he stopped, went down Lake Shore, turned around and came back and still did not see anything.

Nimeth showed jurors a map and said the time, distance and cross streets Sheet cited made no sense.

Sheets self-reported the accident on Dec. 8, 2015 but did so because one of the clues at the accident site were pieces of Bondo, an auto body repair paste. His 1968 Chevy truck had chunks of the substance on the front from a prior accident, and he knew it would be difficult to get repairs with that information published in news reports, Nimeth said.

Circuit Judge Heidi Davis ordered a pre-sentence investigation. The maximum sentence is 30 years, with a four-year-minimum mandatory, although technically the judge could waive that requirement.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190509/clermont-man-guilty-of-hit-and-run-fatality?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T13:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748

""The Crazy Water Day"" by Ella Rose Briones

Let me describe a daft water fun day!

The day’s temperature was hot and humid.

My sister said, “Do you want to go play?”

I hopped up and made a pyramid.

“Look out,” screamed my Jack Russell Terrier,

“Yikes, there’s a baby shark on the next street.”

“Oh who cares,” Sis said, “the more the merrier,

but be careful or you’ll be its sweet treat.”

“Run fast, “cried my Husky, “it will get you!”

“No way, I want the excitement,” I said.

But when I saw the shark it just sang pew.

Mom yelled, “You are insane! Go to bed!”

I know this all sounds incredibly crazy.

It really is very surprisingly hazy.

""Yesterday’s Sonnet"" by Abby Lunsford

With paper in hand, I watch the sun rise;

The sun has gone down on my yesterday,

Marking the hardships the past years comprise

As I brush the sadness and pain away.

Looking forth from the past to what’s ahead,

Thinking of all I did and all I’ll do;

Of the things I wanted to do instead,

And all I did despite knowing the truth.

Now at the dawn I begin life again,

So sparkling and fresh, a tender new day.

And all the more as I pick up a pen,

I consider my new sonnet today.

My burdens laid down, I know I can say

I’m glad I let go of my yesterday.

""Misery"" by Vanessa Yunussova

Everyone knows that feeling of despair,

How you feel that you'll be blue forever,

When all you wish to do, is just sit there,

The thought that feeling glee is a never.

This feeling and I have become quite close,

I know this too well to act unconcerned,

Some people have their daily dreary dose,

Feeling that all this pain, they simply earned.

No one enjoys these melancholic thoughts,

Where you feel all empty on the inside,

And you believe all your heart does, is rots,

That joy is lost, regardless if you tried.

The thought that dismal is where you belong,

Fills your heard, but you must be extra strong.

From 2018: Read the sonnet finalists from the Southern Shakespeare Festival contest

High School

Untitled by Liz Garone

In our youth we do not anticipate

Bliss lost along with ignorance we’ll find

Comes with the end of spring it is innate

Can opened eyes retain an opened mind?

Yet youth is like a flower yet to bloom

Left closed how can it show what is inside?

Left sealed a bud will not know of the room

It had to grow if only it had tried

But as a bud has petals all along

So do our minds with knowledge to be found

Need to taste the fruit called life is not wrong,

But rather the only way we are unbound

So growing up is just a way to bide

The child that we all still have inside.

""Siren Song"" by Thelonious Linford

...and as I floated on the tranquil sea

I came across a strange, small, floating isle

And there one lone young woman sang to me

Her voice stretched out, all men near to beguile

Her skin was soft and fair like brightest snow

Around her head her golden braids did twist

None other did my red heart want to know

Than this fair maiden; salt air and sea kiss’d

But something made her seem more siren like

Perhaps the scaly glint upon her skin

Or yellow teeth each sharpened like a knife

Which shone as her voice tried to draw me in

Thus warned, we set out 'cross the stormy brine

But even now she preys upon my mind

""Sonnet of Beckett"" by Aidan Monroe

To stand before the tyrant of nine kings

Beneath the confines of hallowed comfort,

Thy lord enslaves me through locks without keys

Lest I appeal to his home winter court.

His words will cut through my skin as if swords,

His posture transforms abodes into cells;

And those among him patrol 'bout the ward

directing their demands till I've been felled.

But what grand honors my king provides me:

To groom his fur coat and polish his crown;

Dependence unheard, affections unseen

His love makes this heart dare not let him down.

For never a storm born summer compare

A monster so loyal, brutish and fair.

""Gloriana"" by Bob Ferdinand

(an acrostic sonnet)

England’s great queen, fairest jewel of our isle!

Lady most gracious, whose praises we sing —

Inspire fair-flourishing Nature, while

Zephyrs blow sweetly in earliest Spring.

Abounding in virtue, temp’rate and wise,

Benevolent justice flows from her hands

Ensnaring the wicked, dishonor and lies

To strengthen and prosper all she commands.

Her beauty shines warmly, pure as the sun!

Timeless and radiant, heaven’s true light.

Unrival’d in glory, God’s Chosen One!

Dauntless she rises to take up the fight.

Our love and devotion grow stronger each year,

Renown’d Gloriana — queen without peer.

""One Fair Morn’"" by John Ryan Hall

One fair morn I found me in a forest

Beside a birch I imagined I would form

An arrow from it’s faithful inmost breast

I fancied that I would face the storm

Of those fierce darts that cause me dread

I decided I too would be armed

To strike the little demon of love dead

Only then could I be free from harms

Yet Jove’s imp scorned the image in my mind

And swiftly assigned your eyes to reside

Instead of those arrows only orbs I find

Thus he did all my engines deride

For how can I that deathless boy overcome

When I looked in your eyes and knew you’re the one.

"" Ah, Time Itself doth help us ably age"" by Thomas Robert Moore

(The title is from Line 9, a frequent Shakespearean “transition"")

Whilst young, n’er did I fret ‘bout growing old.

Yet Time doth boldly bring its storms and rain.

So soon learned I, one’s health’s worth more than gold,

As Time deals deftly Aging’s aches and pain.

My eyes and ears do fail me all too fast.

How can I win Life’s fickle flirt with Fate?

Or hope to cope, breathe breaths that long will last?

And find loud laughs, sweet smiles? And not too late?

Ah, Time Itself doth help us ably age:

We find the means o’er time to learn what’s real.

The very limits Life makes us engage,

Do bring near, All we see, hear, smell and feel.

We can embrace whate’er we treasure most.

Then, daily live that love we each hold close.

432,Interim fire chief selected to replace Stravino,"BARTOW — A county deputy fire chief has been named interim chief of the department.

Robert Weech, deputy fire chief of logistics and special services for Polk County Fire Rescue, was tapped to lead the beleaguered department a day after Chief Tony Stravino announced he was retiring in 30 days.

Weech, 52, started at Polk County Fire Rescue in February 2017.

County Manager Jim Freeman, who is retiring in August, said incoming County Manager Bill Beasley will make a decision on a permanent hire after he leaves. Neither Weech nor Beasley, currently the deputy county manager who oversees infrastructure, could be reached for comment.

The new chief will face challenges in the wake of a critical outside report that pointed to numerous problems in the department, including a high turnover rate in one of the fastest growing areas in the country.

County Commissioner George Lindsey said he suspects Weech will be in charge for several months before Beasley decides whether he will permanently appoint him or conduct a search.

Weech started his firefighting career at the city of Deerfield Beach in 1999 and rose through the ranks to become assistant chief of administration in 2008.

When that agency merged with other operations, Weech served as division chief of finance and was later promoted to assistant chief of operations.

Before becoming a firefighter, Weech was a certified public accountant for a large international accounting firm. He has an accounting degree from Florida State University and a master’s degree in Organizational Development from Upper Iowa University.

If Weech is the permanent selection, he will likely oversee some big changes in the department. A report released by Emergency Services Consulting International showed a number of errors that occurred during the response to a Nov. 23 fire on Rockridge Road in North Lakeland that left a 76-year-old woman dead. Lorretta Pickard died speaking with a 911 operator as she waited for more than 20 minutes to be rescued.

Lindsey said during the next public meeting he plans to instruct staff to ask fire officials to begin constructing a timeline of how the county can achieve the recommendations made by the consulting group. There were recommendations from 24 key findings in the 250-page report. A number are centered around a lack of staffing.

""I want to get a realistic expectation of the accomplishments and a dollar figure on them so the Board can begin to tackle these issues,"" Lindsey said.

Some of the more important issues could be expensive, including offering firefighters more money so they will stay at the department rather than leave for neighboring counties.

""We can't be this training ground for other departments,"" Lindsey said. ""We have to be competitive.""

Lindsey said the county is on the right track with plans for new fire stations and investments in other assets, such as tools and trucks.

440,20 women honored for contributions,"FORT WALTON BEACH — The room was packed Tuesday at the University of West Florida Emerald Coast campus.

The crowd, made up mostly of women, gathered for the annual Okaloosa County Commission on the Status of Women’s (OCCSW) Women of Honor event.

Jeanne Rief, historian for OCCSW, said that the Commission on the Status of Women was first established in 1946 by the United Nations. The Okaloosa chapter, however was not founded until 1995, after the Board of County Commissioners passed a resolution to approve it. The group was originally called the Okaloosa County Women’s Hall of Fame.

“The purpose of the Hall of Fame is to recognize and honor women who have made significant contributions to the improvement of women and citizens of Okaloosa County,” Rief said to the crowd. “Most of the women are true pioneers in the community.”

At Tuesday’s event, 20 local women were inducted. Most have served in the public realm in some way either by leading nonprofits, women’s health initiatives, environmental preservation projects or other significant services. Of the 2019 honorees, two women were nominated posthumously: Paula Riggs and Catherine Prince.

Sarah Marcrom, who received her mother Paula Riggs’ certificate, said she felt the significance of her mother’s contribution to the community during the induction ceremony.

“She loved this community so well, she loved it for a long time,” Marcrom said. “It means a lot for her to be recognized after she passed. Just to look around the room and see all of the women who worked so hard for equality, today it hit me that I’m standing on my mother’s shoulders.”

Another group of women, dubbed the “Magnificent Seven,” were inducted together. The group represented the female employees of the Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce. This was the first year the OCCSW has inducted honorees in a group format.

One woman in the chamber group, Patricia Payne, noted that this was actually her second nomination to the Women of Honor, as she was inducted in 2012 for creating a cultural awareness committee for the chamber.

“I’m just a people person and I love it,” she said of her job at the chamber. “I was in shock that my name was actually part of it. I said, ‘Are you serious?’ But it’s very nice, it’s very much of an honor.”

The 2019 Women of Honor inductees are: Michael Baugh, Megan Betancourt, Barbara Britt, Shari Flowers Bruns, Mary Gutierrez, Linda Sue Heller, Tracy McCreary, Sara Michaelson, Julie Sacco Porterfield, Catherine Prince, Paula Riggs, Elia Saxor, Laurel Vermillion, Eppi Azzaretto, Debbie Dodge, Chrissy Flanigan, Rachelle Graves, Patricia Payne, Dayna Stinebiser and Camille Webster.

The names of all current and past OCCSW honorees are on display on a large plaque in the Emerald Coast UWF library in Fort Walton Beach.

441,"Woman who stabbed Volusia deputy, burned boyfriend's home, to serve 52 days in prison","An Edgewater woman who set her boyfriend’s home on fire and stabbed a sheriff’s captain was sentenced this week to a year in prison, but will only serve 52 days in a state facility, court records show.

That is because Brittany Bonin, 27, spent 314 days in the Volusia County Branch Jail when she was arrested Oct. 21, 2017. Those days were credited to Bonin, her Orlando attorney Richard Hornsby said.

""Fifty-two days. That's one way of looking at it but she really did more than a year,"" Hornsby said in a telephone interview on Tuesday afternoon.

Bonin's no contest plea resulted in her being adjudicated guilty on two felonies, first-degree arson and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and misdemeanor domestic battery.

The sentence did not please the family of Michael Demalia, whose house was destroyed by the fire, his mother, Donna Demalia, said on Tuesday.

Bonin's prison time will be followed by two years house arrest and five years probation, court records show.

""Come on! I guess that's the Florida justice system for you,"" Donna Demalia said by phone Tuesday.

Edgewater police said they arrived at 4:17 p.m. Oct. 21, 2017 at 3319 Pine Tree Drive to find black smoke coming from the home. In a neighboring driveway, police found sheriff’s Capt. Clifford Williams restraining Bonin. Williams told officers and was heard in a 9-1-1 call saying Bonin had stabbed him in the lower back, reports state.

Bonin pleaded no contest in open court on March 29 to domestic battery, aggravated battery on a person with a deadly weapon and first-degree arson. She faced a minimum of four years and 10 months in prison but Hornsby filed a motion asking the court to impose a downward departure sentence.

On Monday, Circuit Judge Dawn Nichols sentenced Bonin to 366 days, of which 52 days will be served in state prison followed by the supervised probation.

Bonin will also have to complete mental health treatment and 100 hours of community service, court documents state.

In Bonin’s arrest report, Edgewater police said the woman went to the Pine Tree Drive home, where her boyfriend Michael Demalia lived, to get her belongings and end their relationship. The pair got into a physical confrontation.

When Michael Demalia left the home, Bonin broke a fish tank and started setting clothes and a shower curtain on fire, police reports state.

Michael Demalia had gone to a neighbor, Williams, to call 9-1-1, investigators said.

Bonin planned to commit suicide by crashing her car into a tree but couldn’t get the car started to leave the scene, police said. Instead, when she saw Michael Demalia in Williams' driveway, she grabbed a knife and went after the boyfriend, police said.

Bonin swung at Michael Demalia and that’s when Williams got in between them to stop the fight. The sheriff’s captain said he was unaware Bonin had a knife until he punched her in the face to bring her down to the ground and felt a sharp object go into his back, reports state.

In his motion asking the court to impose a lower sentence, Hornsby argued that Bonin had no prior criminal history and that Michael Demalia was physically and emotionally abusive to her. Bonin wanted a monogamous relationship with Michael Demalia but he manipulated Bonin's emotions and used her for sexual purposes, the attorney said in his motion.

Hornsby argued that the deputy was injured while Bonin was flailing wildly towards Michael Demalia and in response Williams punched her in the face. Williams' injury did not require any treatment beyond a cleaning and a small bandage, Hornsby said to the court.

""The judge found that (Bonin) needed specialized mental treatment, that the offense was unsophisticated, isolated and that she is remorseful,"" Hornsby said on Tuesday.

Donna Demalia said her son is not talking to the media about the case but she wanted people to know that her family is not pleased with the court's decision.

Her son is slowly recovering from the 2017 incident.

""He's got a lot of help rebuilding but he lost a lot of sentimental things he won't get back,"" Donna Demalia said. ""I hope that every night she closes her eyes, she remembers what she took from him.""

442,Southwest Florida golf column: Naples woman makes two aces in four-hole span,"Naples' Kim Spreng made two holes-in-one in a four-hole span on April 26 on the Sabal Course at The Strand. (Photo: Submitted)

Kim Spreng and her husband Rick went out to play a quick nine holes on April 26 on The Sabal Course at The Club at The Strand.

Spreng had no idea how memorable that was going to turn out.

Neither did Kathy Beers when she played at two different courses within a week last month.

Spreng, 53. used a pitching wedge and made a hole-in-one on the 78-yard No. 5.

""The ball's in flight and Rick called and said 'It's going to be a hole-in-one' and I said 'No' and it went in,"" Spreng said. ""It was pretty cool.""

Three holes later, Spreng stepped up on the 80-yard No. 8 with her pitching wedge again.

""(Rick) was in the golf cart and he couldn't see the green, but he could see the flight of the ball, and he said 'Oh, another hole-in-one,'"" she said. ""I just shook my head yes. He said I don't see the ball, and I said 'No, it's in the cup.'

""It's pretty fun. He's still looking for his first.""

As he puts it, her husband has a ""hole-in-three."" He made a hole-in-one on a par 3 after hitting a ball out of bounds.

Spreng is now up to three. Her first was at her home club in Ashland, Ohio, a few years ago. The Sprengs have been coming to Southwest Florida since the late 1990s, bought a place in 2011, and are now retired.

""I played through high school and when I was working, I quite for a while and then started back up probably 15 years ago,"" Spreng said. ""I started playing more and since we retired a couple of years ago. When you live on a golf course, it makes it a lot easier to play more.""

Beers, 73, was playing in the Women's Gulf Coast Interclub tournament at Worthington Golf & Country Club in Bonita Springs on April 15.

""It was our second hole (No. 7), and it was a 119-yard par 3 up a hill and into the wind,"" Beers said. ""I hit it a 7-iron and it just kind of went over the ridge and we never saw it again.""

Beers almost had more excitement. No. 5, a par 3, was their final hole. She hit the flagstick and stopped a foot to the right of the hole.

Ellen Bonn, Mary Ann Rohloff, Mary Pendergast witnessed that one.

A week later, at almost the same time of day, Beers was at her home club, Highland Woods Golf & Country Club, and she came to No. 5, a 93-yard par 3.

""I hit a 9-iron and it just kept rolling around and went in the hole,"" she said. ""We saw that one. I've been playing golf for 50 years and bemoaning the fact that I've never had a hole-in-one.""

Shirley Wood, Marianne Patton, and Wendy Gardner witnessed that ace.

Beers' strong string has continued. On Sunday, her ball went over the edge of the hole on a par 3 and stopped a foot behind.

""All of a sudden, it's been working,"" said Beers, who will head back north to Oconomowoc Golf Club in Wisconsin.



Joe Fitori and Jim Fahey had a different twist on a unique golf feat.

While playing in the same group at Pelican Marsh, Fahey made a hole-in-one on No. 4 from 137 yards out with an 8-iron. Later in the round, Fitori made a double eagle on the 16th hole. Bob Call and John Weaver witnessed each.

Advertisement Skin care products made from salmon hit South Florida Line of topicals uses component of salmon to rejuvenate skin, smooth wrinkles Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Dermatologists believe a key to having youthful skin could be found in the water or even on your dinner plate. A line of products called Restorsea PRO use the protein from salmon roe to help minimize the effects of aging on the skin.""I think it’s a novel protein and a novel product, and I think there’s science behind it,"" said Dr. Kenneth Beer. The idea for the topicals actually started as an observation in Norway. Beer said he knows the woman who noticed workers at a fishery there had very smooth hands and wanted to conduct more research. Tests revealed that an enzyme that hatching salmon release to dissolve the shells of their eggs is a natural exfoliant. ""So she distilled it, isolated it, purified it and started to make a skin care product that harnesses the various proteins for antiaging effects,"" Beer said. ""With wrinkles, you’d see results in the first few weeks.""A version of Restorsea was released in 2013, and after more trials and research, changes were made to increase the effectiveness of the product now called Restorsea PRO. Items have to be ordered through a licensed medical practitioner, and Beer is the only one currently offering it in Palm Beach County.""I think that fair-skinned, thin-skinned people, where there’s less of the barrier of the molecule getting through the skin, will do well,"" he said in regards to the types of people who will benefit most from using the products. ""I think people that tend to have a lot of dry skin will do well, and people that have blue eyes with a lot of sun exposure will tend to do well.""Beer noted that the product does best with the improvement of fine lines and wrinkles but can help with the pigment of dark spots over time. Similar to how the main ingredient of the salmon protein helps dissolve the shell of the egg, the topicals aim to get rid of dead cells to help rejuvenate the skin.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/skin-care-products-made-from-salmon-hit-south-florida/27355421,2019-05-07T09:34:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

446,Woman found with alleged arcade-scamming device in St. Lucie County,"CLOSE If you see a crime being committed, leave anonymous tips with Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers. GINNY BEAGAN/TCPALM April 2019 Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

ST. LUCIE COUNTY — A woman was arrested after St. Lucie County Sheriff’s investigators said they found her with an electronic device that apparently helped her scam arcade machines out of money, according to an affidavit.

Karolyn Griffith (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY ST. LUCIE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE)

Karolyn Griffith, 30, of Sanford, was arrested May 3 on charges related to grand theft, fraud and giving false information to a law enforcement officer.

More: Man jailed in two alleged violent cases, including home invasion, in St. Lucie County

Deputies about 3:15 a.m. went to the Gold Rush arcade in the 6600 block of South U.S. 1 and spoke to Griffith, who investigators say tried to hide “a black electronic box with a red button and an antenna,” an affidavit states.

An employee said Griffith was winning too much money and it didn’t make sense.

The employee said Griffith and two others were there at the time, with “all acting like they did not know each other.” Griffith and a man occasionally changed between machines.

Investigators tested the device that Griffith had. A deputy switched on the device and was able to add credits to one of the machines.

The amount of money missing from the two machines totaled nearly $2,800.

Griffith was taken to the St. Lucie County jail, but it could not be determined Monday whether she had been released on bail.

447,Sentencing for drug dealer charged in overdose death,"<p>An Orange Park man convicted of selling the drugs that led to a woman's fatal overdose will be sentenced in federal court Monday.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a federal jury found Trumaine ""Lucky"" Muller guilty of selling heroin and fentanyl, among other charges. Investigators said Ariell Brundige, 18, her boyfriend and another man went to Muller's apartment and bought what they thought was heroin in 2016. But that heroin turned out to be fentanyl.</p>

<p>Brundige died of an overdose the next morning. Prosecutors said toxicology results showed Brundige had well over the lethal amount of fentanyl in her system.</p>

<p>Her boyfriend, Tyler Hamilton and that second man, Christopher Williams, were charged with manslaughter in the case and pleaded guilty last year.  </p>

<p>The State Attorney's Office had previously charged Muller with first-degree murder, but the case was moved to federal court and the murder charge was dropped.</p>

448,Army vet saves Titusville woman who floated hundreds of yards out into the Indian River Lagoon,"TITUSVILLE, Fla. - A Titusville woman is thanking an Army veteran for saving her life after the current took her hundreds of yards into the Indian River Lagoon.

Kay Reed said she and her boyfriend were at the lagoon Friday afternoon. She was floating in an inner tube when the current pulled her far out into the water.

""I couldn't swim back in,"" Reed said.

Her boyfriend, who was on the shore, called for her to come back, but she couldn't. He was on the phone with 911 dispatchers when Army veteran Kyle Ahart saw what was happening.

""She was really far out there,"" Ahart said.

The 34-year-old veteran who served for nine years and was deployed five times said he just happened to be in the right place at the right time.

""I guess that was God's plan,"" he said.

He was parked near Reed's vehicle reading and studying to become a commercial pilot.

He said that, when he saw Reed struggling his instincts took over. He jumped into the water and swam out to save her. He said he knew he couldn't wait for first responders to arrive.

""If I hesitate, she'll be gone,"" Ahart said.

Ahart, who said he is not a strong swimmer, got Reed back to shore where she was checked out by paramedics.

Reed said she is overwhelmed with gratitude. She reunited with Ahart on Sunday morning at the site of the incident and thanked him by giving him a card and an angel statue.

""I could have died. I could have drowned until he came to me,"" Reed said.

Ahart said he did what he was trained to do and is thankful he was there when Reed needed him the most.

""I consider myself somebody that sees somebody who needs help, I would hope that anybody would do that if they seen somebody else,"" Ahart said.

Reed is calling him her hero and angel.

""God bless him. He's my life. He's my angel,"" she said.

450,"St. Lucie County sheriff's captain to be memorialized in Washington, D.C., before thousands of people","Almost 30 years ago, Charlie Scavuzzo was a Fort Pierce police officer when his best friend and fellow officer Danny Parrish got shot and killed in the line of duty.

Scavuzzo went to Washington, D.C., when Parrish’s name was added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, the country’s monument to officers who die in the line of duty.

“When they put Danny on the wall in Washington, Charlie went and he always talked about it and what a huge deal it was and how awesome and amazing it was,” said Scavuzzo’s widow, Tonya Scavuzzo.

Charlie Scavuzzo, 49, died in September 2017 when he was a captain with the St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office. His name is joining Parrish's on the wall.

He is one of 371 names added this year, and the only one from the Treasure Coast.

More: Arcade scamming device a first for St. Lucie County Sheriff's investigators

A candlelight vigil is scheduled Monday night on the National Mall. The names will be read. It's an event St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara expects 10,000 to 12,000 people will attend. A memorial at the U.S. Capitol is planned for Wednesday.

“It’s going to be hard. I think it’s going to be super emotional, but I can’t think of any better way than this for Charlie to be remembered on this kind of scale,” Tonya Scavuzzo said. “It’s a tremendous honor and he absolutely deserves it.”

Charlie Scavuzzo, who spent more than a decade as a narcotics investigator, died of a heart attack after a particularly difficult period on the job.

From 2009 through 2018, the top three causes of law enforcement officer deaths are gunshots, job-related illnesses and automobile crashes, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.

‘No matter what it took’

Sheriff’s Chief Deputy Garry Wilson said Scavuzzo worked around the clock in the days before his death, helping prepare for Hurricane Irma, and immersing himself in a homicide investigation.

Mascara and Tonya Scavuzzo, 49, said his work ethic was typical.

More: Man jailed in two alleged violent cases, including home invasion, in St. Lucie County

“He was going to finish the job no matter what it took,” Mascara said. “If it took working day and night for three or four days that’s what he always did. That’s just the kind of guy he was.”

Mascara remembered that on the day Scavuzzo died, he ran into him at a Dunkin’ Donuts. Mascara asked him how he was doing. He said Scavuzzo remarked he was exhausted, and Mascara encouraged him to sit down and relax. Scavuzzo wouldn’t have it, Mascara said, saying he had to get going because he thought he had a lead on the homicide case he was working.

Later that day he told some people in his unit he was going home because he felt exhausted and wanted to shower, freshen up and come back to work, Mascara said.

“He was coming back to work, but he never came back,” he said.

‘Poncho’

Mascara shared a story about Scavuzzo and his deep connections to the community.

Shortly after he was elected sheriff, he answered a call from a woman who wanted to remain anonymous, he said. She had important information for “Poncho.”

More: AK-47, drugs seized in St. Lucie County after deputies told about planned gang shooting, robbery

He said his secretary didn’t know Poncho, nor did Mascara. Mascara said he called the woman back and said he needed more information.

“She said, ‘You don’t know who Poncho is? Everybody in Fort Pierce knows who Poncho is. It’s Charlie Scavuzzo’,” Mascara said. “That was his street name.""

Everyone called him that and adored him and shared a tremendous amount of information with him because they knew they could trust him, Mascara said.

Charlie Scavuzzo was honored during the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office's Laying of the Wreath Service for National Law Enforcement Memorial Week on May 6 in Fort Pierce. That service honored the Sheriff's Office's eight heroes and one K9 that gave their lives while serving the community in St. Lucie County.

Mascara said he’s been to the ceremonies for three other deputies, including sheriff’s Sgt. Gary Morales, who was shot to death in a traffic stop in 2013 south of Edwards Road.

The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is located in Washington DC. The memorial is where those who died are remembered while providing a place where survivors can pay tribute to their loved ones. (Photo: MATTHEW SOBOCINSKI/USA TODAY staff)

Charlie Scavuzzo was close with Morales, mentoring Morales while Morales was in the drug unit until he became a sergeant.

Tonya Scavuzzo said her husband didn’t attend the event in Washington when Morales’ name was added to the wall.

“He did CPR on Danny (Parrish) so when it happened to Gary I don’t think he could have went, honestly,” Tonya Scavuzzo said. “He was Gary’s boss and he thought of Gary as a son, so it was really tough on him.”

More: Robert Kraft sex spa video evidence will not be released in masseuse's court case

Mascara said he thought Scavuzzo may have been elected the next sheriff after Mascara retires. That, he said, is why he moved Scavuzzo to different areas in the agency so he could get experience.

Mascara said after he first was elected in 2000, he tried to speak to all sheriff’s employees to ask what was working and what needed to be changed or improved.

“One of the things that I heard quite often from the employees of the Sheriff’s Office was that Charlie Scavuzzo had to be returned back to the drug unit,” Mascara said.

Mascara said moving Scavuzzo from road patrol back to the drug unit was his first transfer.

'Deserves every bit of this’

Tonya Scavuzzo said several family members, including their three children, who range in age from 18 to 22, will be in Washington for the event.

“Being recognized locally is one thing and Charlie deserves it,"" Tonya Scavuzzo said. ""But nationally, where he’ll be there forever and everybody will know that he was a real hero, that’s what I want my kids to see.

“They already know that he was our superman, but he was more than that. He deserves every bit of this.”

455,Sex cult leader on trial says he just wanted to create a 'secret society of women',"Advertisement Sex cult leader on trial says he just wanted to create a 'secret society of women' Share Shares Copy Link Copy

The members of the upstate New York group called Nxivm looked up to Keith Raniere as a leader who spread his ideas on how to achieve success and happiness, but prosecutors say, he was actually a conman who took advantage of vulnerable people.""He targeted people who were looking to improve their lives,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Tanya Hajjar in her opening statement Tuesday at Raniere's trial in New York City. ""Once he gained their trust he took advantage of them. The defendant said that he was a mentor, but he was a predator.""Raniere, 58, has been charged with racketeering, sex trafficking, sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking, among other offenses. He has been held in federal custody in Brooklyn since his arrest in Mexico in March 2018. On Tuesday, he appeared in court wearing a gray sweater with a button down shirt, seated next to his attorney Marc Agnifilo.""I certainly agree with one thing,"" Agnifilo said in his own opening statement, in response to claims raised by the prosecution. ""You are going to hear the truth.""Agnifilo argued that the prosecution's own witnesses will testify that they loved being part of Nxivm -- an organization that prosecutors have deemed a pyramid scheme but others call a cult.Nearly 17,000 people took the self-help classes that Nxivm offered, Agnifilo said, and he urged the 12 jurors to look at the facts of the case through Raniere's perspective.Raniere's five other co-defendants have pleaded guilty and might testify against their former mentor. Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, ""Smallville"" actress Allison Mack, Kathy Russell, Lauren Salzman and Nancy Salzman have pleaded guilty to crimes ranging from visa fraud to racketeering.One former Nxivm member, identified only as Sylvie to protect her identity, began testifying Tuesday afternoon about coercion she said she experienced while part of the organization.Raniere has pleaded not guilty to all charges. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.Recruits provided 'collateral' information, prosecutors sayNxivm, created by Raniere in 2003, exploited recruits ""both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants' benefit,"" said U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue.An affidavit prepared by an FBI agent that was filed in support of the arrest warrant said Nxivm was based in upstate New York and operated like a multilevel marketing scheme, pushing members to take classes that cost as much as $5,000.It encouraged members to take more classes to move up the ranks and to recruit other members to help create more revenue, which left some members in debt to Nxivm itself, the affidavit said.The members in Nxivm called themselves ""Nxians,"" and wore different colored sashes that signified their ranks, the affidavit said. They signed nondisclosure agreements and promised not to reveal certain things about Nxivm's teachings, the affidavit said.Within the group was a secret society called DOS that prosecutors say consisted of dozens of women who were ""masters"" or ""slaves."" The affidavit said DOS masters went after recruits who were ""experiencing difficulties"" in their lives.While recruiting them, the masters would insist the recruits provide information about themselves as ""collateral,"" to encourage the recruits to keep information about DOS a secret, the affidavit said.The collateral included sexually explicit photos, videos in which the member tells damaging stories about themselves and letters making damaging statements against friends or family, the affidavit said.DOS had a pyramid structure, with Raniere at the top as the highest master and the only male, the affidavit said.Women who served as ""slaves"" were expected to complete tasks for their masters, and could be punished if they failed, the affidavit said. The affidavit said some slaves were expected to have sex with Raniere and stick to extremely low-calorie diets to stay thin -- because Rainere liked thin women.In one of the most bizarre allegations, some DOS members were branded with a cauterizing pen on their pubic regions in ceremonies that were recorded and could take half an hour, the affidavit said.""Some DOS victims were told that the brand stood for the four elements (the lines represented air, earth, and water and the cauterizing pen represented sealing with fire),"" the affidavit said. ""Based on information obtained during the course of the investigation, however, it is clear that the brand in fact consisted of Rainere's initials.""The man at the topRaniere's mission was teaching others about how to achieve true happiness, said his lawyer, Agnifilo.""Part of what I feel I have to prove is that Keith Raniere is not a monster,"" Agnifilo said. ""He's a well-intentioned person who spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how to help people be happier.""Raniere denies Nxivm is a cult, Agnifilo said.""He's nervous that the case has created a lot of what he views as sort of prejudice against him and his ideas,"" Angifilo said. ""He firmly believes his ideas are sound ideas, are good ideas, are humanitarian ideas.""He thinks DOS is a good idea and is a pro-woman group. He created it to have women have their own society ... where men would play no role.""Before starting Nxivm, Raniere had founded a company called Executive Success Programs which was supposed to ""actualize human potential,"" said the affidavit.Is Nxivm really a cult?Prosecutors don't go as far as to call the group a cult in court filings.But cult expert and former cult member Janja Lalich -- who was not a member of Nxivm and is not a witness in the trial -- says it ""absolutely"" is a cult, which she defines as a group or social movement with a shared devotion to a charismatic, authoritarian leader that's structured in such a way that it asserts influence and control over its members to keep them under their control. She believes this is the biggest trial of a purported cult leader in nearly a decade.""The Nxivm courses were used as a way to draw people into the more restricted and more perverse inner circles, including DOS,"" Lalich said. ""In a sense, Nxivm is a front to draw people in to be able to target certain people and pull them in further and further.""Lalich said that most people who become involved with cults were recruited as members by family or friends. And once inside, it became difficult to leave.Actress Catherine Oxenberg, a former star on the TV show ""Dynasty,"" also thinks Nxivm is a cult. Oxenberg was able to get her daughter, India, out of the group. She had no comment on if India was asked to testify in the trial.Mother and daughter started taking Nxivm classes in 2011, thinking they would learn about entrepreneurship, Catherine Oxenberg said in an email to CNN. India became more engrossed in the classes and moved from Los Angeles to Nxivm's upstate New York headquarters, her mother said.""One of the most deeply evil tricks of cults, Nxivm/DOS in particular, is that they hide behind the veneer of choice, even choices many rightly say are virtuous,"" Catherine Oxenberg said. ""But in cults such 'choices' only serve the perverted goals of the leader.""Testifying could be 'empowering but devastating'Bronfman, Mack, Russell, Lauren Salzman and Nancy Salzman were accused of serious crimes of their own, including prosecutors' allegation that they ""were aware of and facilitated Raniere's sexual relationship with two underage victims,"" including a 15-year-old girl. Dozens of child pornography images are part of the evidence.Mack, 36, pleaded guilty in April to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges and faces up to 40 years in prison. She was a DOS master and helped co-found DOS, which was targeted toward actors, prosecutors said.Bronfman, who served on Nxivm's executive board for nearly a decade, used her wealth to help finance Nxivm's activities, prosecutors said. She tearfully pleaded guilty in April to concealing and harboring undocumented immigrants for financial gain and fraudulent use of identification. She faces up to 27 months in prison and agreed to pay $6 million in forfeiture to the government.Lalich said she has spoken with about a dozen former Nxivm members, and believes it will be difficult for Raniere's former followers to face him in court, especially those who have recently pleaded guilty.""It'll feel empowering but it'll also be devastating,"" Lalich said. ""I'm hoping that the attorneys have a good support system set up for all of those women.""Agnifilo told CNN he believes that if any of the women who have pleaded guilty testify against Raniere, it would only help his case, and that Raniere has repeatedly told his attorney that he hopes his co-defendants don't have to serve prison time.""I think they're going to be important witnesses for both sides,"" Agnifilo said. ""I think they're going to give an accurate, balanced perspective.""",https://www.wpbf.com/article/sex-cult-leader-on-trial-says-he-just-wanted-to-create-a-secret-society-of-women/27407763,2019-05-08T17:11:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
456,Stetson professors venture to prison to educate inmates,"In her first class there, Stetson University associate professor of philosophy Melinda Hall discussed whether it was wrong to lie — a likely thought-provoking choice for her audience, inmates at the Tomoka Correctional Institution in Daytona Beach.

As a 5-foot-2-inch woman venturing into a men’s prison to teach for the university’s community education project, Hall admitted she was a little nervous at first. She didn’t know the offenders’ backgrounds, their crimes, or if they’d take to the lesson. The austere surroundings of razor wire, security checkpoints and numerous guards didn’t help settle her.

But her fear quickly dissipated after getting to know her students, who she said were receptive, friendly, but most of all, curious.

“It became clear to me that this space that the incarcerated students and the faculty … what we’re building together is not a space to be fearful about,” said Hall, one of the program’s four co-directors. “What we’re building together was a community.”

The volunteer effort started simple enough when it began in 2014: Bring a few books to the prison and read them. The idea was spurred on in part because of Florida’s above average incarceration rate, Hall said.

In 2018, Florida ranked 14th in the nation for incarcerations, where for every 100,000 residents, 833 — or nearly 20 percent more than the national average of 698, were jailed, according to a prisonpolicy.org report.

“The idea was always just to connect incarcerated people in Florida with college education,” Hall said.

The program has grown since its first meeting as a reading group in the prison visiting park, Hall said. Now there’s a dedicated classroom in the prison library, and the courses covered have included workshops and guest lectures on everything from computer science to film, said fellow program co-director Jelena Petrovic, an assistant professor in communication media studies.

Because of a $210,000 grant from the Laughing Gull Foundation, which aims to increase incarcerated students’ access to college courses, the program now offers one college credit course to inmates each semester. The program is just one of two in the state that offers college credit courses to inmates, Hall said.

About six instructors taught 14 students Approaches to World Cultural Studies this semester, Petrovic said.

Because some students might not have been to college, instructors need to be flexible in how they teach the material. However, that doesn’t mean inmates get a free pass. The classes are as rigorous as those taught on campus, Hall said.

In order to focus on education, rather than the dehumanizing aspect of criminalization, instructors deliberately aren’t made aware of the inmates’ crimes, Petrovic said.

“We were all driven by this idea of community service, education as right for everybody,” Petrovic said.

Recently, in an effort to uncover the “history that was erased by slavery,” three inmates have been collecting, transcribing and analyzing archival documents about slaves who worked at the Spring Garden Plantation, now DeLeon Springs State Park. Their findings have been published on historical websites, Petrovic said.

While critics might claim there’s more use in learning a trade than in exploring metaphysics or debating the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Hall said they’d be missing the point.

“I think it’s about soft skills of communication and connection,” Hall said. “The thing is, is that they’re being treated as a member of the community in that space … and it provides a new sense of self-worth and the ability to imagine a different future for yourself. They might not necessarily need to know how to fix a car, but they’re always going to need to know how to talk to somebody.”

Besides offering skills that could open to doors to a multitude of jobs, Petrovic said that the program, being credit bearing, also could help inmates earn degrees. Further, while many prisons offer some sort of vocational education, higher education offerings are “sorely needed,” she said.

“Our partnership with Stetson University and the staff at Tomoka Correctional Institution is one that provides an incredible opportunity for inmates to broaden their higher education studies,"" Patrick Mahoney, who oversees the prison's academic inmate education programs, said in an emailed statement. ""Stetson’s emphasis on high quality education creates an academic atmosphere that is essential to the continued learning and betterment of those involved.”

The benefits of inmate education aren’t anecdotal; a 2014 RAND Corporation study funded by the Justice Department found that inmates who participate in correctional education programs had a 43 percent lower chance of returning to prison and a 13 percent higher chance of finding a job when they were released than for those who did not.

Given the overcrowding of prisons and expense of housing inmates, programs that reduce rates of return to prison provide value for the communities the serve, Hall said.

Hall said the rewards of seeing the student accomplishments were “huge,” and that some students, through virtual presentations of their work at conferences, have had their voices heard “outside the walls of Tomoka.”

“I found it very, very meaningful, because I was able to take what I had learned, this very rarefied stuff that you only get access to with a certain amount of privilege and make an impact and give it to people in a different way, who otherwise wouldn’t be able to access it,” Hall said.

Stetson is looking to expand the program, enrolling 30 students next year. Eventually the university would like to be able to offer inmates a degree, Petrovic said.

However, for that to happen, the program would need more resources, she said, adding that those looking to volunteer or donate can visit here.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190508/stetson-professors-venture-to-prison-to-educate-inmates?rssfeed=true,2019-05-08T13:04:06Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

459,Adopted son of Jerry Sandusky wants to help child abuse survivors,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - It's a name you don't hear often in the news anymore, but one that's hard to forget: Jerry Sandusky. The former Penn State assistant football coach is serving up to 60 years in prison on child sex abuse charges. He still says he's innocent, but one of his sons -- Matt Sandusky -- insists he's not.

Matt spoke with News4Jax anchor Staci Spanos while he was in town speaking to Jacksonville's Exchange Club. He talked about how he was adopted by Jerry and now travels the country talking about what he said Jerry did to him.

Matt wants others to hear his story, learn from it, and heal from any abuse they may have experienced -- just like he's healing.

""The very first memory I have I was about 3 years old. I was sitting on the edge of a bed. My biological dad was sitting beside me, my mother and my grandfather were pounding on the door trying to get in. What my dad was doing was burning my toes with a cigarette lighter,"" Matt explained while speaking recently at Jacksonville's Exchange Club .

Matt said that difficult start to his life primed him to be the perfect prey. Matt claims he fell victim to his predator, Jerry Sandusky -- whom he met as a troubled youth.

Jerry would go on to be his foster father and ultimately his adoptive dad. During his Jacksonville speaking engagement, Matt said that the abuse started with a simple but sinister grooming process when Sandusky picked him up one day to watch a football game.

""I got into the car, shut the door and he put his hand on my left knee. He didn't squeeze my knee, he didn't move it, he didn't ask anything about it. I just knew it made me super uncomfortable as a 9-year-old boy, but as I would do many times over the years, I told myself it felt weird because it wasn't natural to me,"" Matt explained.

When Staci asked Matt what kind of guy Jerry Sandusky was, he told her, ""90 percent of the time that I spent with him and the Sandusky family was everything that I wish every single child would have in their lives.""

""That's very hard for people to understand because they seem to be this great person and behind closed doors they're a monster,"" Staci followed up.

""Yeah, and that's how society wants to reckon with these issues,"" Matt said. ""We want to paint the people that do these crimes, these heinous monsters. It's hard when we have to justify and come to the realization that they are parents they are coaches, they are loved ones in the child's life, in our lives, they're friends of ours and that's hard for us to grasp and why we still have a hard time dealing with this issue.""

Staci Spanos also spoke with child safety expert Stacy Pendarvis, who implements safety programs in schools across the country. Pendarvis said one statistic shows 95 percent of sexual abuse is preventable through education -- and that education needs to start at home.

""So I always tell parents start today. All a parent needs to do is say I saw a story on the news today about sexual abuse, I want to have a conversation about it. It's a perfect introduction even if you've never had a conversation with your child. And then every opportunity you can get, talk about it,"" Pendarvis suggested.

Matt said no one was there to talk to him about what was acceptable behavior, and subsequently, he said Jerry Sandusky abused him for years.

When Jerry Sandusky was brought to trial in 2012 on dozens of charges of child sexual abuse involving 10 victims, Matt -- at least outwardly -- appeared to support Sandusky.

""I didn't stick by him,"" Matt stated. ""I need people to understand that I was protecting myself. This was the biggest secret I had in my life. I didn't want anybody to know what he had ever done to me and what he had forced me to do to him.""

""For 20 years, every single day, all I could think about was making sure no one found out what ever happened to me,"" he explained.

Matt said he has severed ties with the Sandusky family, including Dottie Sandusky -- Jerry's wife, and the woman he once considered his adoptive mother. None of the Sandusky siblings support him, and one of them, Jeff Sandusky, is serving up to 7 years in prison for pleading guilty for child sex abuse charges.

Matt has since founded the Peaceful Hearts Foundation, dedicated to the healing of sexual abuse survivors. And he has a message for anyone who is suffering the trauma of abuse.

""Number one, I would say you're not alone. Number two, I would say it wasn't your fault, you're not to blame for any part of it. Number 3 is you are loved. You are deserving of love. And number 4 is you can heal from this, you will heal from this.""

460,Records show recent airline crashes run against trend toward safer flying,"ASSOCIATED PRESS - After a long trend toward greater safety in air travel, there has been an uptick in airline accidents and deaths in 2018 and 2019.

Many aviation experts regard that recent increase as a statistical blip, however. They note that accidents and deaths remain a fraction of the numbers from as recently as the 1990s.

Advances in aircraft and airport design, better air traffic control, and improved pilot training are often cited as factors in reducing accidents.

""I don't think we'll ever get to zero accidents, but aviation is still the safest it's ever been,"" said Seth Young, director of the aviation program at Ohio State University.

In the U.S., no airline passengers were killed in accidents from 2009 until April 2018, when a woman on a Southwest Airlines jet died after an engine broke apart in flight.

Worldwide, there were more than 50 fatal airline accidents a year through the early and mid-1990s, claiming well over 1,000 lives annually, according to figures compiled by the Flight Safety Foundation. Fatalities dropped from 1,844 in 1996 to just 59 in 2017, then rose to 561 last year and 209 already this year.

Nearly half of the airline deaths in 2018 and 2019 occurred during the crashes of two Boeing 737 Max jets in Indonesia and Ethiopia. In each case, investigators are examining the role of flight software that pushed the nose of the plane down based on faulty sensor readings.

That raises concern about safety around automated flight controls, said William Waldock, an expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

""Pilots are not being trained as much as pilots as they are system operators and system managers,"" he said. ""So when something happens and the automation fails, they get flummoxed.""

Beyond the two Max crashes, safety experts see little immediate connection between other incidents such as the deadly weekend crash of a Russian plane that caught fire after an emergency landing in Moscow and the case of the charter airliner that ran off a Florida runway into a river; no one died in that one.

Investigators probe crashes in search of clues to prevent more accidents from the same cause. In the case of the Aeroflot jet that caught fire, killing more than 40 people on board, attention is likely to turn to Russian media reports that lightning disabled the plane's communications system and whether pilots should have burned off fuel before the emergency landing.

Lightning strikes are not uncommon. In the U.S. alone, there are about 25 million every year, according to the National Weather Service. A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said airline planes get hit about once a year on average.

Planes are built so that the fuselage acts as an electricity-conducting shield, keeping the voltage away from passengers and critical systems. The jolt is often dissipated off wings or the tail. Critical electronics have surge protection. Nitrogen is used to reduce the risk that electrical arcing could spark a fire in a fuel tank.

Newer planes like the Boeing 787, which uses carbon composite material instead of aluminum, includes fine wiring in the wings to direct current off the plane, said John Hansman, an aeronautics professor at MIT.

""They should be designed to take a lightning strike,"" Hansman said, ""but if you don't have a perfectly grounded airplane, if you don't have the right surge suppressors, it's possible you can take out some of the avionics or electronics.""

Sunday's fiery crash in Moscow raised questions about making an emergency landing shortly after takeoff, while the plane is still fully loaded with fuel and likely over the maximum landing weight.

Only very large airliners have the ability to dump fuel. Most jetliners including the popular Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 do not. That leaves only one option for lightening the fuel load on a plane like the Russian-made Sukhoi SSJ100 - circling long enough to burn fuel.

John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant, said he would only circle if he were concerned that something was wrong with the plane's landing gear, or the runway was too short.

Video of the landing showed the Aeroflot plane seem to touch down on its main landing gear, then bounce up before coming down hard a second time. At that point, flames can be seen coming from the jet.

Video also captured passengers toting their carry-on luggage as they fled the burning jet. Passengers on U.S. airlines are told to leave personal belongs in an emergency because it can slow the evacuation when seconds are precious.

""We will never know if more lives could have been saved if the bags were left behind,"" said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants.

461,Stories of Destin: 'He was happiest when he was out on the water',"NICEVILLE — Lee Johnson Neugin stands on a deck outside her Niceville home. Built by her parents, it was the first home ever built on Bayshore Drive.

“He (Neugin's dad) would get up at 3 in the morning and catch trout and redfish off the dock,” she said. “Then he would jump in the boat, head out to the gulf and usually by 9 a.m., he was back.”

Although the deck has been re-done since her parents' time, it still holds special memories for Neugin.

Her parents would spend many afternoons sitting on the deck with a beer, talking and laughing with each other. Only a few feet from the back deck is the dock where her dad spent most of his time.

Born in 1934 in Safford, Arizona, Larry Johnson grew up riding horses and hunting, but fishing was always his favorite. Neugin pulls out a picture that shows her father holding a string of fish as a toddler.

She smiles.

“He was happiest when he was out on the water,” she said.

Fate and the Air Force brought Johnson and his family to Destin. After joining the military out of college, he was stationed at Eglin Air Force Base three times before eventually retiring to Niceville in 1972.

He and his wife, Jean, bought property on Boggy Bayou and built their dream home with only the help of their two kids. Neugin still remembers pulling down giant vines from the pine trees that covered the lot.

Neugin can still see him pull up in his teal Volkswagen.

The Johnsons were very involved with the Eglin Yacht Club, where they made friends with local Destin fishing captains such as John Zwaska and Chubby Destin.

“They loved everyone in the yacht club so we would spend out weekends out on the harbor,” Neugin said.

In those days, Crab Island was still an island, but Neugin said no one ever went there. Instead, the place to be was a small island called My Island, which was located near East Pass before the jetties were built.

“One year they planted palm trees on Crab Island and after Hurricane Katrina, we found them floating in the water.”

Neugin recalls a time when Destin and her dad rescued an injured porpoise and nursed it back to health in Destin.

“Destin built a 3- or 4-foot-high pool and had a pump pumping saltwater into it for the porpoise,” she said. “My dad and brother would catch live baby mullet to feed it until Destin released it back into the wild.”

Before he retired, Johnson served as a weapons officer on a C-130 during the Vietnam War. The family was living in Los Angeles at the time and after not hearing from her dad for over eight weeks, Neugin and her mom were told his plane had been downed — and he was listed as being missing in action.

“We thought we had lost him and after four months, my mom started making arrangements to move back here because they had already bought this property,” Neugin said. “Then one day, out of nowhere, he came through the door.”

Johnson had been injured and lost in the jungle when his plane went down. Nuegin said some good Samaritans found him and hid him in tunnels to help him avoid being captured until he could be rescued. During that time, he was exposed to Agent Orange, a defoliant chemical sprayed on the jungle by U.S. planes.

Johnson developed leukemia and died two years after he retired. Even as he lay in the hospital bed during his final days, Neugin remembers him believing he was on a boat. He was laid to rest at sea at his favorite fishing spot, White Hill. Nuegin said it was the prettiest ceremony she'd ever attended.

Neugin was supposed to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy to become the first female pilot, but when her dad passed away, she said she lost her courage. Instead she became the first woman to graduate from the University of Florida’s engineering program and the first female aerospace engineer at Eglin Air Force Base.

“I guess in a way, I still came through for him,” she said.

Her mom passed away four years after her dad, leaving a hole in Neugin’s heart that she said will never be filled. But with the help of pictures, family recipes and memories, she can smile and remember “the good old days.”",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190507/stories-of-destin-he-was-happiest-when-he-was-out-on-water?rssfeed=true,2019-05-07T09:39:13Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548

Brian Kemp addresses the 2019 Season Joint Budget hearings, in Atlanta. Kemp is set to sign legislation on Tuesday, May 7, 2019, (Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, File)

ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp is set to sign legislation banning abortions at around six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they’re pregnant.

Kemp’s office says the signing at 10 a.m. Tuesday at the state Capitol in Atlanta will be attended by lawmakers including state Rep. Ed Setzler, the bill’s author.

The signing ceremony caps weeks of protest and marks the beginning of what could be a costly legal battle.

ACLU of Georgia legal director Sean Young said the law is unconstitutional and that the ACLU plans to challenge it in court.

“Every federal court that has heard a challenge to a similar ban has ruled that it’s unconstitutional,” Young said in a recent interview.

Anti-abortion activists and lawmakers across the country have been energized by the new conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court.

Several GOP-controlled states are pushing abortion bans in an attack on the high court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

Similar abortion bans have recently been signed into law in Mississippi, Kentucky and Ohio, and are being considered in a number of other states.

Kentucky’s law was immediately challenged by the ACLU after it was signed in March, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it.

Under current law, women in Georgia can seek an abortion during the first 20 weeks of a pregnancy. If it’s not blocked in court, the new ban would take effect on Jan. 1, 2020.

The Georgia measure makes exceptions in the case of rape and incest — if the woman files a police report first — and to save the life of the mother. It also would allow for abortions when a fetus is determined not to be viable because of serious medical issues.",https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/georgia-s-republican-gov-kemp-set-to-sign-abortion-ban/1985505905,2019-05-07T08:20:50Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

The rainy season that doesn't officially begin until May 15 in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties, comes with the kind of life-threatening lightning, tornadoes and flooding that have highlighted the area's weather since Friday.

Underscoring the atmospheric mayhem was an unusual bolt of lightning up to 10 times stronger than a typical flash that was caught on video by Boynton Beach resident Erica Hite on Sunday.

>> RELATED: Why Florida's summer thunderstorms are unique, deadly

The so-called continuous current, or positive lighting, which was identified by the National Weather Service in Miami after seeing the video, hit outside Hite's apartment when she was taking video to show her family how bad the weather was.

The 12-second clip of the blinding strike that sounded like firecrackers going of was played on MSNBC's Morning Joe and repeatedly on The Weather Channel. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, positive lightning originates in the upper reaches of a cloud's anvil and make up less than 5 percent of all strikes.

""It was crazy. Very scary, very loud,"" Hite said. ""It was just the right place at the right time. I could probably never in my life get something like that again.""

Hite said the strike damaged a concrete dumpster enclosure.

Weather-related damage on Friday included the loss of half a horse stable roof in Loxahatchee when a weak tornado touched down. The EF-0 with 70-mph winds was confirmed by an NWS survey team. No people or animals were injured, according to the survey team.

And up to 300 lightning bolts as hot as the sun cracked the sky in West Palm Beach between 4 and 7 p.m. Sunday, leading to the cancellation of the Tears for Fears show at SunFest to the dismay and ire of fans. Country music star Keith Urban's flight was diverted from PBIA to Miami because of heavy rains, winds and lightning on Sunday, but somehow his band hit the stage just after 9 p.m.

Meteorologist Larry Kelly said the Miami office of the NWS was in constant contact with SunFest or police officials to give them weather updates, but didn't make any decisions as far as far as asking people to seek shelter or canceling shows.

While Florida's unique sea breeze-initiated thunderstorms are the norm for summer as daytime heating lures in winds from both coasts, the recent storms also had an upper-level southwest flow that pushed them to pile up along the coast.

Rain totals Sunday were highest in Miami-Dade County, but areas in Boynton Beach and Jupiter received more than 2 inches, with Lake Worth getting 1.95 inches.

The official measure at Palm Beach International Airport was 0.91 inches.

>> RELATED: Date, not dew point, starts ""rainy season""

Miami's National Weather Service office decided last year to set standard rainy season dates beginning May 15 and ending Oct. 15. South Florida gets an average of 70 percent of its rain during the wet season.

""It's just like hurricane season starting June 1,"" Kelly said. ""Sometimes you get storms before.""

Before the dates became standard, the rainy season was determined by looking at dew point temperatures, sea surface temperatures and an established pattern of rainfall typical to the rainy season for at least three consecutive days.

The National Weather Service in Melbourne still does it the old fashioned way.

""We are getting to the point where everything switches to the afternoon thunderstorms and basically rain every day,"" said meteorologist Krizia Negron, who works in the Melbourne NWS office. ""We are getting close to it for sure.""

469,"Prince Harry embodies every proud new dad, offers sweet words about wife, son","Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks to the media at Windsor Castle on Monday following the birth of his son (Steve Parsons - WPA Pool/Getty Images).

The newest member of the royal family has arrived: a son, born to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the duke and duchess of Sussex.

Prince Harry stepped away from royal father duty just briefly to speak with members of the media.

“This little thing is absolutely to die for, so I’m just over the moon,” he told reporters Monday outside Frogmore Cottage, the couple’s home not far from Windsor Castle, according to published reports. “Mother and baby are doing incredibly well. It’s been the most amazing experience I can ever possibly imagine. How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension, and we’re both absolutely thrilled.”

This marks the first interracial baby in the monarchy’s recent history. The newborn sits just behind Prince Harry in line to the British throne -- in the seventh spot. It’s unclear if he’ll get a royal title.

The baby, whose name still hasn’t been announced, arrived at 5:26 a.m. May 6. Prince Harry was said to have been there, and then the royals announced the birth on a recently created Instagram account a short time later.

The infant weighs 7 pounds, 3 ounces.

Markle’s mother, Doria Ragland, is with the couple as well at Frogmore Cottage.

The royal pregnancy was announced in October 2018, and for months, people only knew the couple were due in spring 2019. Eventually, Markle told the public when she was six months along, meaning we were able to assume the baby would arrive in late April or early May.

Prince Harry and Markle are coming up on their one-year anniversary, as they wed in May 2018.

“More details will be shared in the forthcoming days,” the Instagram post announcing the birth says.

The break-in was reported Saturday in the 600 block of Deltona Boulevard.

According to a Volusia County sheriff's incident report, the homeowner said he was awakened by the sound of breaking glass and discovered a man, later identified by officials as Michael Jiminez, in his home.

The homeowner said he got his 9mm handgun and told the man to leave and fired a warning shot into the ceiling because the man didn't immediately comply, according to deputies. The homeowner said he was in fear for his life, the incident report said.

Jiminez dropped to the ground when the gun was fired, and the homeowner called 911, deputies said.

Jiminez said he believed he heard a woman screaming for help inside the home, which used to be a business owned by someone he knew, according to authorities.

Jiminez said he broke a window with a pocketknife and entered the home, according to officials.

Deputies said Jiminez had a backpack containing hypodermic needles and cut straws, all of which tested positive for methamphetamine.

Jiminez was arrested on charges of armed burglary to an occupied structure, possession of amphetamine, possession of methamphetamine, possession of narcotics paraphernalia and criminal mischief.

No one was injured in the incident.

479,There Is Nothing on Earth We Want to See Less Than Jerry Falwell Jr.'s 'Personal' Photos,"Photo: Alex Wong/Getty

Former Trump lawyer and current prison inmate Michael Cohen said in a recording earlier this year that he helped conservative scumbag Jerry Falwell Jr. cover up “personal” photographs of the sort that would generally be kept “between husband and wife,” according to Reuters. Cohen helped Falwell out with this dilemma in 2016, months before Falwell endorsed Trump for president.



That these photos of Falwell exist at all is ironclad proof that we live in hell.

Falwell, whose father was a well-known conservative evangelical psycho, is the president of the hyper-Christian Liberty University. Leaked nudes wouldn’t exactly be a good look for him.



The Falwells declined Reuters’ request for comment.



This cursed story was uncovered via a secret recording of a phone call made by comedian Tom Arnold to Cohen in March and obtained by the Wall Street Journal last month. Cohen’s comments about Falwell on the call weren’t previously reported.

From Reuters:

The Falwells wanted to keep “a bunch of photographs, personal photographs” from becoming public, Cohen told Arnold. “I actually have one of the photos,” he said, without going into specifics. “It’s terrible.”

Michael, we believe you!!! Please don’t say more!!!

What did Cohen actually do to fix the situation for Falwell?

The source said Cohen flew to Florida and soon met with an attorney for the person with the photographs. Cohen spoke with the attorney, telling the lawyer that his client was committing a crime, and that law enforcement authorities would be called if the demands didn’t stop, the source said. The matter was soon resolved, the source said, and the lawyer told Cohen that all of the photographs were destroyed.

Thank god.

Two sources told Reuters that Cohen later convinced Falwell to endorse Trump for president before the Iowa caucuses. The sources told Reuters that the endorsement was not connected with Cohen’s help on the photograph issue. Regardless, Falwell’s endorsement was a major boon for Trump’s credibility with evangelicals at a critical point in his campaign.

Cohen reported to prison in upstate New York earlier this week to serve out a three year sentence for bank fraud and tax evasion. In his call with Arnold, Cohen said that he pleaded guilty to crimes he didn’t actually commit in order to protect his wife.

481,"US pregnancy deaths are up, especially among minorities","Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (AP Photo/Teresa Crawford)

Pregnancy-related deaths are rising in the United States and the main risk factor is being black, according to new reports that highlight racial disparities in care during and after childbirth.

Black women, along with Native Americans and Alaska natives, are three times more likely to die before, during or after having a baby, and more than half of these deaths are preventable, Tuesday’s report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes.

Although these deaths are rare — about 700 a year — they have been rising for decades.

“An American mom today is 50% more likely to die in childbirth than her own mother was,” said Dr. Neel Shah, a Harvard Medical School obstetrician.

Separately, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released new guidelines saying being black is the greatest risk factor for these deaths. The guidelines say women should have a comprehensive heart-risk evaluation 12 weeks after delivery, but up to 40% of women don’t return for that visit and payment issues may be one reason.

Bleeding and infections used to cause most pregnancy-related deaths, but heart-related problems do now.

“Pregnancy is really a stress test” because of the extra blood the heart is moving for mom and child, said the head of the guidelines panel, Dr. James Martin. That can reveal previously unknown problems or lead to new ones.

The CDC report found that about one third of maternal deaths happened during pregnancy, a third were during or within a week of birth, and the rest were up to a year later.

Globally, maternal mortality fell about 44% between 1990 and 2015, according to the World Health Organization. But the U.S. is out of step: Moms die in about 17 out of every 100,000 U.S. births each year, up from 12 per 100,000 a quarter century ago.

Possible factors include the high C-section rates in the U.S. and soaring rates of obesity, which raises the risk of heart disease, diabetes and other complications.

Black women in the U.S. are about three times as likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause as others, partly because of racial bias they may experience in getting care and doctors not recognizing risk factors such as high blood pressure, said Dr. Lisa Hollier, the obstetrician group’s president.

Stacy Ann Walker may be an example. She was 29, healthy and excited to be expecting her first child eight years ago “when the unimaginable happened and left both of us fighting for our life.”

The Hartford, Connecticut, woman said her doctor brushed off her complaints of shortness of breath, exhaustion and swelling in her legs as normal aches and pains of pregnancy. Her baby developed life-threatening complications requiring an emergency cesarean section, and weighed less than 3 pounds at delivery.

But her ordeal wasn’t over. After the birth, she developed heart valve problems and heart failure, requiring surgery.

“Never did I think my life would be in danger,” said Walker, who is black. She spoke at a news conference the obstetricians group held on the guidelines.

The CDC looked at about 3,000 pregnancy-related deaths from 2011 through 2015, using death certificates. Researchers also looked at more intensive investigations of about 250 deaths done in 13 states.

The latter review determined that 60% of deaths were preventable. Often, three or four problems contributed to a death, ranging from doctors’ mistakes to the difficulty some women had getting housing and healthy food.

The report shows the need to educate doctors and patients about risks for new moms, and to expand Medicaid health coverage in all states so that postpartum care is available for all moms up to a year after giving birth, said Dr. Alison Stuebe of the University of North Carolina.

“We as a society do a terrible job of taking care of mothers after the baby comes out,” she said.

“It’s like the baby is the candy and the mama is the wrapper,” she added. “Once the baby is out of the wrapper, the wrapper is tossed aside.”",http://www.wfla.com/national/us-pregnancy-deaths-are-up-especially-among-minorities/1987241283,2019-05-07T23:01:00Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
482,Arcade scamming device a first for St. Lucie County Sheriff's investigators,"CLOSE If you see a crime being committed, leave anonymous tips with Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers. GINNY BEAGAN/TCPALM April 2019 Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

ST. LUCIE COUNTY — An incident in which a woman apparently used an electronic device to scam an arcade is the first time St. Lucie County sheriff’s investigators have encountered such a device, according to an official Tuesday and an affidavit.

Karolyn Griffith, 30, of Sanford, was arrested May 3 on charges related to grand theft, fraud and giving false information to a law enforcement officer.

Deputies about 3:15 a.m. went to the Gold Rush arcade in the 6600 block of South U.S. 1 and spoke to Griffith, who investigators said tried to hide “a black electronic box with a red button and an antenna,” an affidavit states.

An employee said Griffith was winning too much money and it didn’t make sense.

Representatives at other arcades said they know of such devices.

Michael Shine said he manages the Tropicana arcade, which opened recently a short drive south of Gold Rush on the west side of U.S. 1

“We know that these devices are out there,” Shine said. “We haven’t seen them as of yet in our place, but we’re very tight on our security.”

Shine said there are different devices, with some incorporated into cell phones or garage door opening-type objects.

He described them as electro-magnetic pulse devices that can manipulate the credit counter in machines.

Investigators tested the Griffith's device. A deputy switched on the device and was able to add credits to one of the machines.

Shine suggested other arcades remain vigilant.

“People are less likely to do things when they feel like they’re being watched,” Shine said.

Meg Pizano works at 777 arcade in a plaza south of Shine’s business.

Pizano said she's heard of such devices. She said they have installed alarms on machines that go off when someone tries to use them.

“There’s all kinds of tricks in this business,” Pizano said.

Pizano said 90 percent of her business is regulars, and when a new face comes in, ""you watch them.

“That’s your job. We don’t know this person,” she said. “Nobody else knows this person.”

She said she talks to people, and asks questions.

In the Gold Rush case, the amount of money missing from the two machines totaled nearly $2,800.

A sheriff’s official said the case is the first time the agency has encountered such a device.

They ""are placed in close proximity to the gaming machine and use a radio frequency to manipulate the programming of the machine to add ‘credits,’” according to the sheriff’s office.

Griffith was the only person arrested, but investigators say it did not appear she was alone.

484,Experts reveal how much you should spend on Mother's Day gifts,"Advertisement Experts reveal how much you should spend on Mother's Day gifts Etiquette experts weigh in on the right amount to spend on Mother's Day Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Oftentimes when we're shopping for the right Mother's Day gift, we're stuck with the question: How much should I spend this Mother's Day? Am I spending too little on the woman who gave me life, or am I spending too much money on a gift that she might not even use? To give you the short answer, experts say there's nothing set in stone on how much money should be spent on a gift. ""What might be a good budget for myself might be a lot of money for someone else,"" said Diane Gottsman, national etiquette expert from the Protocol School of Texas. ""Money should have nothing to do with the value of a gift,"" added Lisa Grotts, an etiquette expert known to many as Golden Rules Gal. ""The adage still rings true: It’s the thought that counts."" If you still yearn to find out the dollar amount you should spend on a Mother's Day gift, a recent Offers.com poll surveyed over 1,000 U.S. consumers about their Mother's Day spending habits and these were the results: The average consumer spent $60.16 on their own mothers (a 43% increase from 2018)$65.95 was spent on wives or partners (down by 14% from 2018) $55.72 as spent on mothers-in-law (down by 28% from 2018) That means most consumers spend well under $100 on Mother's Day gifts. To help you even further with your shopping this year, experts weigh in on other commonly asked questions.What's the best Mother's Day gift?Short answer: Always tailor the gift to your mother's personality. Be observant, noted Gottsman: ""Listen for clues or observe things she makes comments on. Her Pinterest page, and other social media account where she posts things she likes is a great place to start.""If you're still not sure, other great ideas include shoes and accessories — but never clothes, experts suggest. ""Unless you know she has been eyeing a particular dress and she has openly shared her clothing-size, it’s best to skip out on gifts that are clothing size related, as you may quickly offend someone,"" said Myka Meier, etiquette expert at Beaumont Etiquette. Anything mom can pamper herself with is a safe bet, too, like a gift certificate to a salon or spa, suggests Jacqueline Whitmore, founder and CEO of the Protocol School of Palm Beach. When in doubt, opt for something customized. ""Customized gifts tend to make people feel special and show that you went above and beyond to choose something just for them,"" said Meier. ""And always wrap your gift beautifully to show that you put in effort."" How much should I spend on Mother’s Day flowers? There is no minimum for flowers, but be mindful that prices go up on this holiday. Expect to spend at least $75 on a dozen roses, estimates Grotts, but online flower delivery services are more competitively priced.If you're already getting mom another gift, there's no need to break the bank for flowers. ""Your mom wouldn't want you spending outside of your budget,"" said Gottsman. Is money an appropriate Mother’s Day gift?It depends, but Meier recommends against it. ""If you are not sure what she would like, instead try giving her a gift card to a large store or website where she will have lots of options,"" she said.Whitmore had another stance:""Cash is king, especially when it comes to younger moms,"" she said. First-time and new moms might appreciate a little green. And if you do end up giving her some cash, just make sure to gift it right. ""Get a special card and put the cash or a bank debit card she can use anywhere,"" said Grotts. Do I need to buy a gift for my mother-in-law or wife?Yes. ""If you are moved to give someone a gift because you want them to know how special they are, don't hesitate to do so,"" said Gottsman. Jennifer Porter, etiquette expert and founder of Satsuma Designs, agreed. ""Gift giving during Mother’s Day is about showing care for the special mothers and mother-like mentors in our lives,"" she said.""A gift for mom, step-mom and mother-in-law should always top the list and other special moms should receive a card and/or a call on Mother’s Day."" Whitmore recommended getting your mother-in-law a similar gift to what you're getting your own mother, especially if the two are friends: ""If you're getting your mom roses, gift your mother-in-law some nice orchids."" For your wife, try gifts that say something about your relationship or the family. ""I would recommend a locket with the kids' pictures, a spa package for the both of you to enjoy together or a handwritten love letter,"" suggested Gottman, ""which is probably the best gift of all!""What shouldn't you buy for Mother's Day? ""Cleaning supplies,"" said Meier. ""Gift giving should be about spoiling her, not giving her work!"" Instead, opt for a home-cleaning service so she can catch a break.Do I buy a Mother's Day gift, even if she says she doesn't want anything?All experts agreed that for the mom who has everything, time is the best thing you can give. ""I have never met a mother who didn't love the gift of time,"" said Grotts. ""Think day spa or a weekend getaway.""Porter recommended gifting her an experience she can share with you and the family: ""Get her the best tickets you can afford to her favorite sporting or artistic event. These experiences often end up being the best gifts!"" I forgot about Mother’s Day, should I still get a gift?Absolutely, and luckily, you don't have to ever let on that you forgot thanks to super thoughtful last-minute gifts that can be ordered and delivered on Mother's Day. You can disguise a lack of planning by thinking up a very thoughtful gift that mom will love: The key is to make sure the gift doesn't look or feel like it was rushed. Look for retailers that offer fast shipping options such as Amazon Prime, flower services with same-day delivery, a thoughtful DIY Mother's Day gift or whip up a nice homemade brunch just for her. And for the love or all things holy, do not forget a Mother's Day card!",https://www.wpbf.com/article/how-much-money-mothers-day-gift/27392445,2019-05-07T15:28:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
488,Georgia's GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signs restrictive fetal 'heartbeat' abortion ban,"Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed legislation on Tuesday banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. That can be as early as six weeks, before many women know they're pregnant.

ATLANTA — Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed legislation on Tuesday banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. That can be as early as six weeks, before many women know they're pregnant.

Kemp said he was signing the bill ""to ensure that all Georgians have the opportunity to live, grow, learn and prosper in our great state.""

The signing caps weeks of tension and protests at the state Capitol in Atlanta, and marks the beginning of what could be a lengthy and costly legal battle over the law's constitutionality.

The legal showdown is exactly what supporters are looking for.

Anti-abortion activists and lawmakers across the country , energized by the new conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court that includes President Donald Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, are pushing abortion bans in an attack on the high court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion nationwide until a fetus is developed enough to live outside a woman's uterus.

ACLU of Georgia legal director Sean Young said the group would challenge Georgia's new abortion restriction in court.

""Under 50 years of Supreme Court precedent, this abortion ban is clearly unconstitutional,"" Young said in a recent interview. ""Every federal court that has heard a challenge to a similar ban has ruled that it's unconstitutional.""

Under current law, women in Georgia can seek an abortion during the first 20 weeks of a pregnancy. If it's not blocked in court, the new ban would take effect Jan. 1, 2020.

HB 481 makes exceptions in the case of rape and incest — if the woman files a police report first — and to save the life of the mother. It also would allow for abortions when a fetus is determined not to be viable because of serious medical issues.

The bill also deals with alimony, child support and even income tax deductions for fetuses, declaring that ""the full value of a child begins at the point when a detectable human heartbeat exists.""

Republican Rep. Ed Setzler, the bill's author, said in an interview after the bill passed the state House that it's a ""common sense"" measure that seeks to ""balance the difficult circumstances women find themselves in with the basic right to life of a child.""

But Democratic Sen. Jen Jordan disagreed that the legislation was balanced. ""There's nothing balanced about it, it's an all-out abortion ban,"" Jordan said in a recent interview.

Jordan said she is especially worried the new law will push obstetricians away from practicing in Georgia, worsening health care outcomes for women in a state that already has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the country.

""It's about the unintended consequences,"" Jordan said. ""They're making policy choices that are going to end up causing women to die, and they're preventable deaths.""

In the first few months of 2019, ""heartbeat abortion"" bans have been signed into law in four states: Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio, and now Georgia. Lawmakers in a number of other states including Tennessee, Missouri, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Louisiana and West Virginia are considering similar proposals. A bill that recently passed the Alabama House would outlaw abortions at any stage of pregnancy, with a few narrow exceptions.

Kentucky's law was immediately challenged by the ACLU after it was signed in March, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, about 33,000 abortions were provided in Georgia in 2014.",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190507/georgias-republican-gov-kemp-signs-early-fetal-heartbeat-abortion-ban?rssfeed=true,2019-05-07T14:12:19Z,News Chief,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA",FL,33881
490,Seidman: Florida Legislature offers bright spot for adults with disabilities,"Amidst the actions at this year’s Legislature that gave cause for my despair — the arming of teachers; the expanded vouchers program that threatens public school funding; the crackdown on “sanctuary cities” and immigration; the ban on bans of single-use plastics, and the undermining of voting rights for former felons — there was one bright spot that went virtually unnoticed, but by those it most effects.

Even as lawmakers discussed making the Medicaid program more restrictive, they acceded, as part of a budget agreement, to allowing adults receiving disability assistance to earn more money and accrue more savings without losing their government benefits.

“I was wondering if this day would ever come,” Jim DeBeaugrine, a lobbyist and former director of the state Agency for Persons with Disabilities, told the News Service of Florida. That was a sentiment many individuals receiving SSI and SSDI (Social Security Income and Social Security Disability Income) likely shared.

Under current rules, an adult who receives disability benefits while employed cannot earn more than $27,000 a year or have more than $2,000 in cash savings. For anyone hoping to work their way off assistance, this becomes a Catch-22, forcing them to cut back on their hours or even quit their jobs in order to retain the health and medical support their benefits provide.

Florida was one of just four states whose lawmakers had not requested the required federal approval for an increase in income limit for working adults with disabilities. After the idea was floated in 2016, the Legislature said it wouldn’t consider a higher threshold unless an analysis assured it wouldn’t increase numbers in the program.

Money was included in the 2018 budget to pay for that analysis and the result led the House and Senate to agree to seek federal approval for adults on disability to earn up to $50,886 annually and accrue up to $13,000 in a savings account without losing essential adjunct services.

Valerie Breen, executive director of the Florida Developmental Disabilities Council, told the News Service the adjustment was one of her organization’s top priorities for this session and would assure individuals receiving benefits “can remain employed and not lose the care benefits that help them get to and sustain work on a daily basis.”

Through my mental health work, I’ve developed friendships with at least a dozen individuals who’ve admitted to struggling with the income cap while trying to work toward increasing their employment and self-sufficiency. Often the jobs available to them offer minimal wages and are inadequate to cover basic life expenses even while receiving benefits.

For them, this change represents possibly the biggest legislative victory of the session. But for others, it may have come a little late.

Several years after my son was diagnosed with a disabling mental health disorder, he qualified for disability benefits (SSDI) based on his inability to work. Since he didn’t have much employment history at that point, the payments were very small, but the determination also allowed him to receive his healthcare through Medicare. Given his preexisting condition, that was a godsend.

As the person tasked with overseeing and accounting for those payments, I set up a separate bank account where they could be directly deposited, and the cash reserve would be evident. When he regained his health, he returned to work (at minimum wage), first for 15 hours a week, then 30. The job gave him a steady, though nominal income which I supplemented, but as his hours increased, the account began to accrue a small reserve.

When, about 18 months ago, he went full-time, we made a visit to the local Social Security office to ask if his payments could be halted, but the medical benefits continued until such time as he could obtain affordable healthcare elsewhere. Not possible, we were told; if you give up his disability status, you give up the medical benefits — immediately.

Instead, they advised, he should stay on disability and when his income exceeded the allowance, Social Security would itself make that determination and discontinue the payments — and he could then retain his Medicare benefits for up to eight more years! That was an offer I couldn’t refuse.

So my son continued to work, and as he became more self-supporting by using the payments and his wages for his living expenses, my own contributions diminished. The payments did not stop, so he continued to use them until, about six months ago, I requested another review.

During the three months (and three more payments) it took to conduct the review, we let the money accrue untouched in the bank account, despite it being over the allowance. Then came a letter from Social Security, confirming his disability status had been revoked. And oh, by the way, it also noted the payments should actually have stopped almost a year earlier. So, as the payee, I should immediately refund the $8,326 in “overpayments” in the thoughtfully-provided postage-paid envelope enclosed.

I tried not to hyperventilate for the 45 minutes on hold it took to speak to someone by phone. I provided this long and involved explanation and offered to send the balance in the account, which amounted to about a third of the total they were asking for. The impatient woman on the other end of the line cut me off dismissively. “Just send it in,” she said. ""Then you can make monthly payments until you’ve met your full obligation.” She didn't seem inclined to sympathy when I said that money was long gone.

If the federal government approves the Legislature’s request for these new income levels (which is probable), it will increase the likelihood and feasibility of recipients gradually working their way off government assistance. In the meanwhile, my son still has his healthcare and a new job to boot. But the government will be garnishing a portion of his wages for a very long time to recover the payments I asked them not to make in the first place.

494,Tarnished Brass: 22 Big Bend cops lost credentials for misconduct over past decade,"Tarnished Brass Investigation (Photo: Spencer Holladay, USA TODAY)

More than 100 police officers and sheriff’s deputies in Leon and surrounding counties lost their badges over the past 35-plus years for a wide range of misconduct including everything from smuggling contraband into jails and sex on the job to possession of drugs and child pornography.

In the worst cases, officers were fired and sent off to prison. In other instances, officers were terminated for offenses including positive drug tests and DUI. Some of the cases made headlines. Others flew under the radar.

The officers were among 30,000 from across the country whose law enforcement credentials were revoked over the span of more than three decades, according to a database created as part of a USA TODAY investigation.

The ""Tarnished Brass"" investigation:

►We found 85,000 cops who’ve been investigated for misconduct. Now you can read their records.

►Fired for a felony, again for perjury. Meet the new police chief.

► Search the database: More than 30,000 police officers have been banned in 44 states

A total of 106 officers at 15 local law enforcement agencies across Franklin, Gadsden, Leon, Jefferson and Wakulla counties lost their certification for misdeeds dating back to 1984. About a fifth of those officers, some 22, were fired for more recent wrongdoing going back to 2010. Among those cases were officers whose misconduct made headlines.

A well-known former Gadsden County sheriff’s captain, James Corder, was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison in 2015 for stealing more than $1,700 from a pair of burglary suspects and lying about it to the FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

John Crouse, a former Leon County Sheriff’s office reserve deputy, was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2012 for possession of child porn after he got busted sharing the images with an undercover officer in an internet chat room sting.

Roughly half of the 100-plus area cases — some 56 — involved officers with the two biggest local law enforcement agencies in the five counties: the Tallahassee Police Department and the Leon County Sheriff’s Office. However, only eight of those cases occurred over the past decade.

Since 2010, six LCSO deputies and two TPD officers lost their credentials. In both of the TPD cases, the officers were disciplined for testing positive for marijuana.

Aside from Crouse, the five other LCSO deputies were disciplined for domestic battery, unprofessional relationships, obscene communications and smuggling contraband.

Several former law enforcement officers who were fired amid misconduct probes are not included in the database of decertified cops. They include Zachary Wester, a former Jackson County deputy who remains under FDLE investigation for allegedly planting drugs on motorists, and Vincent Crump, an ex-TPD officer whose charges of sexually assaulted a woman he pulled over recently ended for the second time with a hung jury.

496,Suspect wore woman's wig to escape arrest,"VIERA — A drug suspect on Florida's Space Coast tried to elude deputies setting up a perimeter around his house for a bust by bicycling away disguised in a woman's blond wig.

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office said they arrested Robert Walls despite his attempt at disguise.

The sheriff's office said in a statement that when agents caught up with Walls last Thursday to arrest him, he admitted that he was using the wig as a disguise to elude them.

The sheriff's office says he was wanted by a fugitive task force seeking suspects from a major drug investigation that led to arrest warrants for more than 100 defendants.

499,Police: Woman stops to help jogger when suspicious stranger approaches,"LAKE CITY, Fla. - A Lake City woman is being praised for spotting what might have been a dangerous situation for a female jogger and stepping in to help.

The woman said she saw a man driving a pickup truck slow down next to the jogger, who was running on the sidewalk along Southwest McLane Avenue.

The woman said when the man pulled off to the side of the road, she slowed down to keep an eye on things. The man then got out of the truck and approached the jogger.

The man was described as an older white male in his mid-40s to early 50s, wearing a dark ball cap and blue jeans.

When the woman saw him approaching the jogger, she honked and called the jogger over to ask if she knew the man and make sure everything was OK. The jogger said she didn't know him and thanked the woman for stopping.

While they were talking, the man got back in his truck and drove away.

The woman stayed with the jogger until the truck had driven out of sight.

“It is of the utmost importance to be aware of our surroundings,” said Dr. Argatha Gilmore, chief of police for Lake City. “Assisting fellow citizens in this manner is how we keep our community safe. If you see something, say something.”

507,Polk commissioners discuss newly-released analysis of fatal fire,"LAKELAND, Fla. (WFLA) - Polk County Commissioners will discuss the results of a new report surrounding a deadly fire in Polk County.

Commissioners will have a board/staff work session Tuesday to discuss the analysis around 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. The outside company that completed the report, ESCI, will be giving a presentation. The county is then expected to hold a news conference to answer questions.

Polk County officials released the 242-page post-incident analysis on a tragic fire that led to the death of a 76-year-old woman last year in Lakeland, which appeared to back up many of the findings 8 On Your Side has revealed in recent months.

8 On Your Side previously revealed that Polk County Fire Rescue firefighters who arrived first on the scene back in November may not have tried to rescue 76-year-old Lorretta Pickard.

""(Polk County) spent over $30,000 on a report that Channel 8 has already uncovered,"" Pickard's niece Amber Addison said after the report was released. ""You guys have already stated everything that is in that report. But they spent $30,000 to do all of that.""

Pickard died in her burning home while on the phone with a 911 dispatcher for more than 20 minutes on Nov. 23, 2018. Our investigation revealed that firefighters stood outside, and instead tried to fight the flames.

What did the report find? (This will be updated as we continue poring through the pages of the report)

The report completed by Emergency Services Consulting International (ESCI) confirmed many findings of our previous 8 On Your Side investigations.

In the report, ESCI notes the difficulties crews faced when responding to the fire back in November. They stated the home was in a heavily-wooded area and was surrounded by trees. There was also no marked address on the home or main road.

“The home was not visible” from the road and access to the structure was challenging, the report states. They also noted there are no fire hydrants directly near the home.

Capt. James Williams was the captain of Engine 6 (E6) - the first crew that arrived at the scene that night. According to the report, Capt. Williams “chose to forgo bringing Water Tender 6, stating that he wanted to keep the integrity of his crew together should they need to make a rescue of an occupant.”

ESCI found that Capt. Williams’ crew got to the scene at 7:22 p.m. They also found that the dispatcher announced five times between 7:09 and 7:12 that someone was trapped in the home. However, they did state that, “it may not have been apparent to all responding crews that the caller reporting the entrapment and the victim were on in the same.”

The report states that the dispatcher again mentioned that someone was trapped at 7:25. That information was acknowledged by E6. But according to the report, “it was not until after Engine 6’s arrival and upon questioning by Battalion Chief 1 that dispatch reported that, ‘Command, we are still landline there is somebody inside the structure’ and noted the location as the kitchen.” According to ESCI, that happened at 7:30. That was more than 3 minutes after the last contact with Pickard.

After the fire, ESCI found Polk County Fire Rescue personnel did not receive any follow-up or debriefing of themselves or their crews. There was an effort to look at the incident more closely to figure out what happened, but ESCI says that didn’t happen until the county manager was contacted by a concerned Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd on Nov. 26 – three days after the fire.

ESCI also found that there was no contact with Pickard’s family the night of the fire or in the days following the incident.

In their report, ESCI noted that the initial arriving officer (Capt. Williams) ""was relatively new in his position with limited experience and likely had not been faced with an incident like this before.""

According to ESCI, Capt. Williams reported he and his firefighter tried to do a 360-degree survey. But ESCI says “the officer’s focus on the involved side of the home thwarted his attempt” to make that full walk. That would have allowed him to “ascertain more about the progression of the fire, survivable space entry or egress points and other hazards as is standard protocol,” ESCI wrote.

At 7:25, logs show Capt. Williams radioed in saying he needed the next arriving crew to come straight to the house for a “two-in/two-out” to possibly enter the home. But ESCI says the lack of the initial 360-degree survey by Williams made the reconnaissance ineffective.

ESCI notes that the information that was gathered by the call-taker was very good and that the call-taker kept in contact with the caller up until communication was lost 20 minutes into the fire. That was five minutes after Engine 6 reported they were on scene.

“Based on the timeline, radio communication logs and discussion with responders, there was no indication that the E6 crew was either focused on or in a mode to perform a search and rescue after the initial size-up as described,” ESCI wrote in the report.

ESCI also noted that Captain Williams had “tunnel vision” that resulted in him focusing on only one part of the situation rather than the whole losing situational awareness.

According to ESCI, neither Capt. Williams nor his firefighters brought forcible-entry tools, a Thermal Imaging Camera or a pressurized water extinguisher to the structure to help them get inside or search to execute a victim rescue.

In their report, ESCI states that Pickard's body was found near a door that would have been hidden from the initial-arriving crew when standing on a different side of the home. But if the 360-degree survey could have been completed, ESCI says the door would have likely been seen.

According to ESCI, two injuries to responding firefighters were reported and documented from the fire. The report states they were both similar in nature and were documented as first-degree burns due to their close proximity to the fire for a prolonged period. But ESCI found the affected personnel were not treated for the reported injuries. They also found the injuries weren't reported until Nov. 29 - six days after the fire.

One of the key findings that ESCI noted in their report was that information provided by the caller is ""vitally important"" to units assigned to the incident. ESCI found that, in this incident, the caller provided ""considerable information about the structure, her location within the structure, her condition, and access points to enter the structure."" All of that information was put into the CAD and showed up on mobile computers. But ESCI found the first arriving unit had a computer that was out of service. That means none of the information was available to the crew of E6.

During interviews with fire officers, ESCI said it was clear that ""a majority of these officers are concerned with officer training, mentoring and development of the existing officer cadre as well as the newly-promoted and those aspiring for promotions.""

Another key finding ESCI noted in their report was that ""there was no indication that E6 was in a mode to perform a search and rescue"" after arriving at the scene.

""The officer and firefighter reported that they did not take any tools or other firefighter equipment with them to the scene,"" the report states. ""This may further imply the crew was not in a search and rescue mode.""

That infuriated the victim's niece.

""Isn't that sickening? It's absolutely disturbing that you get a call that there's an elderly woman in this building,"" said Addison. ""And then you don't bring anything to get her out with?""

A Sunday bike ride through an Ormond Beach park was anything but pleasant for a woman and her boyfriend.He said he rode right into a fishing line, tied off between a dock and a tree, that was at neck height.The man said he had to fall off his bike to avoid a possible life-threatening injury.The couple alerted police, who took a report and suggested it might have been homeless people in the woods using fishing line to dry clothes, but the couple feels certain this was no accident.""I'm lucky to walk away. It's just scary to think that something like that is out here,"" the man said.The man and his girlfriend asked WESH 2 News not to show their faces since they ride bikes in Central Park almost daily, and fear reprisal for sounding the alarm. But the victim showed WESH 2 News his neck with an angry red mark along his throat where fishing line tied across a path near the Joyce Ebbets Pier caught him. He had to fall off his bike to save himself.""It was burning, like somebody was like, taking fishing wire or something like that trying to decapitate me the whole time,"" he said.""All of a sudden, he goes down to the ground and I see the line come up out of his neck,"" the man's girlfriend said.His girlfriend shared a picture on social media with an arrow showing where the fishing line was located -- fishing line with a hook attached. It had rained, so the pair weren't riding too fast. If they had been riding faster or if the test line had been thicker, she thinks the outcome could have been far more serious.""He could have gone right through it, and it could have taken his head off in all reality,"" she said.Both are sure the fishing line was placed along the path deliberately.It was intentional. There's no way that this could have been somebody's fishing line that got hung up on the dock and they just walked with it because it would have been laying on the ground. It was strung up at neck height on purpose.:Police did a search and didn't find any more possible booby traps.The couple just wants other people in the area to be aware.

512,Georgia's Republican Gov. Kemp signs early fetal heartbeat abortion ban,"Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed legislation on Tuesday banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. That can be as early as six weeks, before many women know they're pregnant.

ATLANTA — Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed legislation on Tuesday banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. That can be as early as six weeks, before many women know they're pregnant.

Kemp said he was signing the bill ""to ensure that all Georgians have the opportunity to live, grow, learn and prosper in our great state.""

The signing caps weeks of tension and protests at the state Capitol in Atlanta, and marks the beginning of what could be a lengthy and costly legal battle over the law's constitutionality.

The legal showdown is exactly what supporters are looking for.

Anti-abortion activists and lawmakers across the country , energized by the new conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court that includes President Donald Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, are pushing abortion bans in an attack on the high court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion nationwide until a fetus is developed enough to live outside a woman's uterus.

ACLU of Georgia legal director Sean Young said the group would challenge Georgia's new abortion restriction in court.

""Under 50 years of Supreme Court precedent, this abortion ban is clearly unconstitutional,"" Young said in a recent interview. ""Every federal court that has heard a challenge to a similar ban has ruled that it's unconstitutional.""

Under current law, women in Georgia can seek an abortion during the first 20 weeks of a pregnancy. If it's not blocked in court, the new ban would take effect Jan. 1, 2020.

HB 481 makes exceptions in the case of rape and incest — if the woman files a police report first — and to save the life of the mother. It also would allow for abortions when a fetus is determined not to be viable because of serious medical issues.

The bill also deals with alimony, child support and even income tax deductions for fetuses, declaring that ""the full value of a child begins at the point when a detectable human heartbeat exists.""

Republican Rep. Ed Setzler, the bill's author, said in an interview after the bill passed the state House that it's a ""common sense"" measure that seeks to ""balance the difficult circumstances women find themselves in with the basic right to life of a child.""

But Democratic Sen. Jen Jordan disagreed that the legislation was balanced. ""There's nothing balanced about it, it's an all-out abortion ban,"" Jordan said in a recent interview.

Jordan said she is especially worried the new law will push obstetricians away from practicing in Georgia, worsening health care outcomes for women in a state that already has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the country.

""It's about the unintended consequences,"" Jordan said. ""They're making policy choices that are going to end up causing women to die, and they're preventable deaths.""

In the first few months of 2019, ""heartbeat abortion"" bans have been signed into law in four states: Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio, and now Georgia. Lawmakers in a number of other states including Tennessee, Missouri, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Louisiana and West Virginia are considering similar proposals. A bill that recently passed the Alabama House would outlaw abortions at any stage of pregnancy, with a few narrow exceptions.

Kentucky's law was immediately challenged by the ACLU after it was signed in March, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, about 33,000 abortions were provided in Georgia in 2014.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190507/georgias-republican-gov-kemp-signs-early-fetal-heartbeat-abortion-ban?rssfeed=true,2019-05-07T09:14:44Z,The Ledger,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815
513,Young kids find pornographic images on free video game platform,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - News4Jax has uncovered a shocking element to Roblox, one of the most popular video game platforms for kids on the internet. The free online platform that allows users to create their own games reaches over 90 million users around the world. However, some parents are on high alert after their kids found pornographic content while playing.

It's not a new problem, but it's still happening. In fact, we have reports of pornographic and inappropriate content that goes back to 2017, with the most recent happening this past month. It didn’t take long for other parents to come forward.

“Unfortunately I walked into the room looked at the screen and it looked like someone hacked into the game, and posted a pornographic image of a woman on one side of the building,” explained George Tudor, a St. Johns County father with three girls.

Tudor says he was horrified when at the age of 6, one of his daughters showed him a very graphic image.

""My first reaction was absolutely shock, how could this happen to my little girl? Then it quickly turned into anger,” said Tudor.

Tudor reported it to Roblox immediately and says the company got back to him quickly. However, he says he couldn’t take back what his daughter saw.

“More than anything, as frustrating as it was, I felt bad having her innocence taken away like that,” he explained.

News4Jax learned this was not an isolated incident. More pornographic images were sent to us by a parent who wished to remain anonymous.

The easiest way to understand Roblox is to think about it as a YouTube for video games. A gamer makes an account through the Roblox website or app.

Yulia Willmore, owner of Code Ninja, in St. Johns, uses the Roblox platform to teach kids coding and how to create online games.

""They can publish a game, they can code it, they can design it, and then they can upload it and it’s available,” Willmore explained.

But she admits, like any open platform, inappropriate users can find their way in. That's why she says parents need to pull up a chair to observe and learn what their kids are doing, ask questions about the games they are playing, and check in on chat rooms -- even ask to see the chats. (In privacy settings, chats can be turned off.)

With issues being reported for years, we reached out to Roblox to find out how inappropriate material continues to make its way onto the platform where potentially millions of children are exposed.

""Even if it's reported, I feel like the damage is already done if a child has seen it. So what is being done, and what do you recommend parents to do to make sure we don't get to that point?"" we asked Roblox VP of Marketing Tami Bhaumik.

“We do everything in our power to filter out everything, and moderation of all of the content. If there is an incident like that we work with parents to make sure we are responding as quickly as possible,” she answered.

Changes have been made over the last two years, Roblox says it has hired more than 800 people to moderate the site and has implemented several different privacy features.

READ: Roblox Parent's Guide

Kids have free access to Roblox by either downloading the app or going through its website, but must create an account before using it. The gaming platform says parents need to adjust those privacy settings when the account is made, to ensure added protections are in place before their child begins.

If you see inappropriate content, report it to Roblox immediately. It has a pretty good response time -- within 20 minutes.

But, Tudor believes safety starts with having real conversations with your children.

“For something like that, you’re not going to be in trouble at all, because we want to know things like that, because our number one goal as parents is to protect our kids,” Tudor suggested.

Below is what Roblox sent News4Jax in response to efforts to protect kids

Moderators

""Our moderators and support teams are global and include an internal team at our headquarters in California and numerous teams around the world to ensure round the clock 24x7 coverage and multilingual capability.

""We monitor and moderate the behavior of our player community and review every uploaded image, video, and audio file used within our games to make sure they are safe and age appropriate.

""Users exhibiting bad behavior have their Roblox accounts moderated, which can include suspensions and deletion of their accounts on Roblox.""

Technology

""We use automated machine learning technology to review all communication between users, looking for inappropriate behavior.

""We also use automation to flag other content for further review by our moderators.

""We have significant restrictions for what users 12 and under can share, including the use of words or phrases that we feel could be potentially dangerous (e.g., sharing any numbers that could be part of a phone number or address).""

Community

""Parental control features allow for the selection of messaging options: (no chat, chat with friends, chat with everyone)

""Players can report inappropriate behavior using our Report Abuse system, which is located prominently throughout the site and in-game.

""In addition, users can easily mute or block any other player that they come across in game.

""Safety is our number one priority, but we don’t stop there. Roblox is committed to empowering kids, teens, parents, and caregivers with the skills to create positive online experiences.""

Roblox's new Digital Civility Initiative is investing in three main areas:

1. Enhancing the in-game experience for players; such as collaborating with leaders in the industry to develop algorithms to help identify and weed out bad actors.

2. Equipping parents, caregivers and educators with actionable resources to promote learning community safety and digital civility.

""This summer, we will launch a new site for digital well-being including safety tips, expert advice from online safety, parenting and education experts, and conversation starters to help parents navigate difficult topics about the digital world. To that end, we have also published a parent’s guide that we continually update with new resources and information as it becomes available.""

3. Partnering with digital safety leaders to strengthen the platform and make a positive impact on the industry.

""We have established partnerships with leading organizations nationwide that focus on child safety and internet safety including Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), Connect Safely, Fair Play Alliance, and kidSAFE among others. Our Trust & Safety Advisory Board is comprised of world-renowned digital safety authorities who help the company strengthen the platform and make a positive impact on the industry.""

515,Deliberations begin in second jury trial for East Naples man accused of DUI manslaughter,"Kiereek Seymour Jr. appears at a hearing to confirm a date for his trial on charges of DUI and fleeing and eluding at the Collier County Courthouse on Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2016. (Photo: Dorothy Edwards/Naples Daily New)

Deliberations in the case of an East Naples man accused of impaired driving and killing a woman in a 2014 crash began at the Collier County Courthouse Monday.

Kiereek Seymour, 29, of East Naples, was charged with DUI manslaughter after an early morning crash at Lakewood and Davis boulevards in East Naples on May 19, 2014.

Sandra Marie Maddux, 54, of East Naples, died from injuries suffered in the crash.

Collier Circuit Judge Joseph Foster declared a mistrial in the case in February after a juror came out of the jury room during deliberations and indicated she was feeling uncomfortable.

Jurors began deliberations around 4:30 p.m. Monday after the new trial began on April 22.

The trial included conflicting assertions about whether Seymour was driving the Jaguar, who was at fault in the crash and whether Seymour's blood-alcohol content was above 0.08, the legal limit for driving.

Assistant State Attorney Mara Marzano began her closing argument by telling the jurors that Maddux lost her life because Seymour was driving impaired due to the alcohol and alprazolam he had in his system at the time of the crash.

While Defense Attorney Peter Adrien said the state had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Seymour was driving the vehicle, was actually impaired or was at fault in the crash that killed Maddux.

Witness testimony proved Seymour was driving the vehicle involved in the crash with Maddux, Marzano said.

""There was never anyone else there,” Marzano said. “There was never any possibility that anyone else got out of that car and ran away.”

Seymour was found by witnesses positioned on the passenger side of the vehicle after the crash and it’s not the defense’s burden to prove who, if it wasn’t Seymour, was driving the vehicle, Adrien said.

Evidence collected by officers from the Florida Highway Patrol showed that Seymour was speeding and driving at least 62 mph at the time of the crash, while Maddux was driving 18 mph, Marzano said.

Adrien told the jurors the investigation by Florida Highway Patrol officers was not done properly and the speeds of the vehicles involved in the crash changed in various versions of the crash report.

Witness testimony also showed that Seymour had a yellow traffic signal and Maddux a red traffic signal, Adrien said.

In addition, Adrien said Maddux’s car had no lights on after the crash. Maddux could have been driving the dark vehicle at night with no lights, which could have contributed to the crash, he said.

However, Seymour’s slurred speech and medical records from the hospital after the crash prove he was impaired, Marzano told the jurors.

“Nowhere here does it say we have to prove he was falling down drunk,” Marzano said.

Seymour admitted to an emergency responder that he had a consumed one and a half beers before the crash and hospital staff recorded Seymour as clinically intoxicated and high, Marzano said.

The additive effect of alprazolam and alcohol impaired Seymour, Marzano said.

“I told you this was a complicated matter,” Marzano said. “I would suggest to you when you pare it down to what is real and not real you will find the defendant guilty.""

Adrien said none of the testing or evidence presented by the state proved that Seymour was over the 0.08 blood-alcohol level limit.

""The defendant is not guilty and this was a horrible accident,” Adrien said. “How could he be? He was following all the traffic rules.”

Even before February’s mistrial, Seymour had been in court before to face charges related to the crash that killed Maddux.

The state attorney's office refiled the DUI manslaughter charge in 2016 after then-Collier Circuit Judge Fred Hardt vacated an earlier plea agreement.

The negotiated plea agreement related to charges stemming from a Marco Island crash and charges from the crash involving Maddux. Hardt wrote that he had to vacate all sentences in the two cases.

516,Sheriff's Office looking for fast fingered scofflaw (VIDEO),"FREEPORT — A thief needed less than a second to snatch a woman’s wallet from her purse — but security cameras are always on the alert.

The crime, committed March 22, occurred at the Publix grocery store in Freeport, and now that the fast-fingered pickpocket has used a stolen credit card, the Walton County Sheriff’s Office has released video footage of the original theft.

Video footage from inside the Publix showed a black female stepping behind the victim, taking the wallet out of her purse and walking off, a Monday news release from the Sheriff’s Office said.

The suspect was wearing a black long sleeve shirt, dark gray sweat pants, sandals and a baseball cap, it said.

A woman who fit the description obtained following the Freeport heist used the stolen credit card at the Walmart in DeFuniak Springs. This time, the Sheriff’s Office said, she was wearing a long-sleeved pink sweatshirt with the words “Panama City Beach Florida,” gray pants, a ball cap, and what appeared to be a wig.

Anyone with information regarding the identity of this person is asked to call the Walton County Sheriff’s Office at 892-8111 or remain anonymous by calling Emerald Coast Crime Stoppers at (850) 863-TIPS.

518,"From extroverts to introverts, podcasting is a growing trend for all to participate","- Imagine being able to say anything you want, whenever you want. Welcome to the world of podcasting where anything goes, as long as the audience loves you.

Some call it a community, while others say it's a movement. But there's no doubt about it, podcasting has arrived. Currently there are over 660,000 podcasts across the U.S. but veteran podcasters, Glenn Heber and Jaime Legagneur, from the popular podcast Finding Florida say it wasn't always this way.

""It's exploding now. Right now it's exploding. I started 11 years ago when nobody listened,"" Glenn explained.

""The biggest response was, 'What's a podcast?'"" Jaime added.

There's one for just about anything. Think of a topic, any topic, and there is mostly likely a podcast for it.

Everyday people like Shondrea Smith have also been driving the podcast movement. She is a young African American woman who travelled from Philadelphia to the Podfest Multi-Media Expo in Orlando.

""This is what I've been looking for, this is where I belong,"" Shondrea explained. ""I'm an introvert so it sort of allows me to create the terms of how I want to rely my message. I think Podcasting is the purest form of expression.""

And a good podcast can bring in up to $50,000 a month, with top shows earning six figures. But veteran podcaster and mentor Shawn Smith said you've got to build an audience.

""Once they build a listenership that's large enough -- two to five-thousand downloads per episode -- that's when sponsors start getting interested,"" smith said.

521,Woman aboard plane that skidded into river says landing 'didn't feel right',"The Jacksonville, Florida, Sheriff's Office Marine Unit was called to assist the Naval Air Station Jacksonville in reference to an airplane in shallow water, according to the Sheriff's Office.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A civilian defense attorney aboard the military-chartered Boeing 737 that skidded into a Florida river said the landing ""didn't feel right.""

Cheryl Bormann spoke to CNN's Don Lemon as she waited with the rest of the passengers rescued following the incident.

Seven crew members and 136 passengers were on the plane flying from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into Naval Air Station Jacksonville. There were no fatalities, but the Jacksonville Fire Rescue said 21 people were taken to local hospitals.

Bormann described a scene of fear, confusion and people coming together to help one another.

The plane arrived four hours late in Guantanamo Bay, and those getting off warned them that the air-conditioning was broken, she said.

""They were pretty universally miserable, so none of us were looking forward to getting onto the plane,"" Bormann said. ""We got on anyway.""

They flew through a storm of thunder and lightning, but the frightening part came when the plane came in for a landing.

'The pilot was trying to control it'

""The plane ... literally hit the ground and then it bounced. It was clear that the pilot did not have complete control of the plane because it bounced some more, it swerved and tilted left and right,"" she said. ""The pilot was trying to control it but couldn't, and then all of a sudden it smashed into something.""

The plane skidded from the runway into the St. Johns River at 9:40 p.m. ET, but did not submerge because it was in shallow water.

Some oxygen masks deployed, and overhead bins opened up and sent belongings spilling out. Bormann said her identification, cash, credit cards, computers, phone and passport were sent flying to the seats behind her so she could not retrieve them.

The passengers onboard didn't know what happened, she said. And they didn't know where they were. For all they knew, Bormann said, they could have been in a river or they could have been in an ocean.

People weren't screaming, Bormann said, because the flight staff worked quickly to give direction. Everyone on the aircraft helped one another to put on their life vests and then climb out onto the wing, into the water, onto the raft and over to the safety of land.

Soldiers, grandparents, children and pets

The plane was carrying military personnel headed home, on vacation, or to get medical care. It included families, civilians, grandparents and children -- all connected to the military.

There were also pets checked in the luggage compartment below. Bormann said they have not been rescued, and they likely didn't make it.

This statement was released by NAS Jacksonville this morning:

""Many people are asking about the pets aboard the aircraft that skidded off the runway into the St. Johns River last night at NAS Jacksonville. Unfortunately, they have not been retrieved yet due to safety issues with the aircraft. Our hearts and prayers go out to those pet owners during this terrible incident.""

Many calls have come into the news room at News4Jax from people concerned about the pets.

The owner of Jacksonville Pet Funeral Home on Beach Boulevard has offered to cremate the pets' remains free of charge. The same business memorialized JSO K-9 Fang last year when the police dog was killed in the line of duty.

Fire rescue officials used a cable to pull an inflated raft with people to a nearby pier.

Naval Air Station Jacksonville said pets have not been rescued due to safety reasons. ""Our hearts and prayers go out to those pet owners during this terrible incident,"" it said in a Facebook post.

After the rescue, Bormann said, border control was processing the travelers. But most passengers don't have the identification that authorities are asking for — those are back on the plane.

""Everyone is sort of milling around because no one knows quite what to do. They won't let us leave,"" Bormann said. ""Everybody is curious about their belongings and want to know what will happen next.""

A Sunday bike ride through an Ormond Beach park was anything but pleasant for a woman and her boyfriend.He said he rode right into a fishing line, tied off between a dock and a tree, that was at neck height.The man said he had to fall off his bike to avoid a possible life-threatening injury.The couple alerted police, who took a report and suggested it might have been homeless people in the woods using fishing line to dry clothes, but the couple feels certain this was no accident.""I'm lucky to walk away. It's just scary to think that something like that is out here,"" the man said.The man and his girlfriend asked WESH 2 News not to show their faces since they ride bikes in Central Park almost daily, and fear reprisal for sounding the alarm.

LAKELAND, Fla. (WFLA) - Polk County officials have released a 242-page post-incident analysis on a tragic fire that led to the death of a 76-year-old woman last year in Lakeland.

The analysis was completed by an outside company that was hired to investigate the fire. 8 On Your Side previously revealed that Polk County Fire Rescue firefighters who arrived first on the scene back in November may not have tried to rescue 76-year-old Loretta Pickard.

The report released Monday essentially confirms that 8 On Your Side report.

""(Polk County) spent over $30,000 on a report that Channel 8 has already uncovered,"" Pickard's niece Amber Addison said after the report was released. ""You guys have already stated everything that is in that report. But they spent $30,000 to do all of that.""

Pickard died in her burning home while on the phone with a 911 dispatcher for more than 20 minutes on Nov. 23, 2018. Our investigation revealed that firefighters stood outside, and instead tried to fight the flames.

What did the report find? (This will be updated as we continue poring through the pages of the report)

The report completed by Emergency Services Consulting International (ESCI) confirmed many findings of our previous 8 On Your Side investigations.

In the report, ESCI notes the difficulties crews faced when responding to the fire back in November. They stated the home was in a heavily-wooded area and was surrounded by trees. There was also no marked address on the home or main road.

“The home was not visible” from the road and access to the structure was challenging, the report states. They also noted there are no fire hydrants directly near the home.

Capt. James Williams was the captain of Engine 6 (E6) - the first crew that arrived at the scene that night. According to the report, Capt. Williams “chose to forgo bringing Water Tender 6, stating that he wanted to keep the integrity of his crew together should they need to make a rescue of an occupant.”

ESCI found that Capt. Williams’ crew got to the scene at 7:22 p.m. They also found that the dispatcher announced five times between 7:09 and 7:12 that someone was trapped in the home. However, they did state that, “it may not have been apparent to all responding crews that the caller reporting the entrapment and the victim were on in the same.”

The report states that the dispatcher again mentioned that someone was trapped at 7:25. That information was acknowledged by E6. But according to the report, “it was not until after Engine 6’s arrival and upon questioning by Battalion Chief 1 that dispatch reported that, ‘Command, we are still landline there is somebody inside the structure’ and noted the location as the kitchen.” According to ESCI, that happened at 7:30. That was more than 3 minutes after the last contact with Pickard.

Dispatch transmission from fatal Polk...

After the fire, ESCI found Polk County Fire Rescue personnel did not receive any follow-up or debriefing of themselves or their crews. There was an effort to look at the incident more closely to figure out what happened, but ESCI says that didn’t happen until the county manager was contacted by a concerned Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd on Nov. 26 – three days after the fire.

ESCI also found that there was no contact with Pickard’s family the night of the fire or in the days following the incident.

In their report, ESCI noted that the initial arriving officer (Capt. Williams) ""was relatively new in his position with limited experience and likely had not been faced with an incident like this before.""

According to ESCI, Capt. Williams reported he and his firefighter tried to do a 360-degree survey. But ESCI says “the officer’s focus on the involved side of the home thwarted his attempt” to make that full walk. That would have allowed him to “ascertain more about the progression of the fire, survivable space entry or egress points and other hazards as is standard protocol,” ESCI wrote.

At 7:25, logs show Capt. Williams radioed in saying he needed the next arriving crew to come straight to the house for a “two-in/two-out” to possibly enter the home. But ESCI says the lack of the initial 360-degree survey by Williams made the reconnaissance ineffective.

ESCI notes that the information that was gathered by the call-taker was very good and that the call-taker kept in contact with the caller up until communication was lost 20 minutes into the fire. That was five minutes after Engine 6 reported they were on scene.

“Based on the timeline, radio communication logs and discussion with responders, there was no indication that the E6 crew was either focused on or in a mode to perform a search and rescue after the initial size-up as described,” ESCI wrote in the report.

ESCI also noted that Captain Williams had “tunnel vision” that resulted in him focusing on only one part of the situation rather than the whole losing situational awareness.

According to ESCI, neither Capt. Williams nor his firefighters brought forcible-entry tools, a Thermal Imaging Camera or a pressurized water extinguisher to the structure to help them get inside or search to execute a victim rescue.

In their report, ESCI states that Pickard's body was found near a door that would have been hidden from the initial-arriving crew when standing on a different side of the home. But if the 360-degree survey could have been completed, ESCI says the door would have likely been seen.

According to ESCI, two injuries to responding firefighters were reported and documented from the fire. The report states they were both similar in nature and were documented as first-degree burns due to their close proximity to the fire for a prolonged period. But ESCI found the affected personnel were not treated for the reported injuries. They also found the injuries weren't reported until Nov. 29 - six days after the fire.

One of the key findings that ESCI noted in their report was that information provided by the caller is ""vitally important"" to units assigned to the incident. ESCI found that, in this incident, the caller provided ""considerable information about the structure, her location within the structure, her condition and access points to enter the structure."" All of that information was put into the CAD and showed up on mobile computers. But ESCI found the first arriving unit had a computer that was out of service. That means none of the information was available to the crew of E6.

During interviews with fire officers, ESCI said it was clear that ""a majority of these officers are concerned with officer training, mentoring and development of the existing officer cadre as well as the newly-promoted and those aspiring for promotions.""

Another key finding ESCI noted in their report was that ""there was no indication that E6 was in a mode to perform a search and rescue"" after arriving at the scene.

""The officer and firefighter reported that they did not take any tools or other firefighter equipment with them to the scene,"" the report states. ""This may further imply the crew was not in a search and rescue mode.""

That infuriated the victim's niece.

""Isn't that sickening? It's absolutely disturbing that you get a call that there's an elderly woman in this building,"" said Addison. ""And then you don't bring anything to get her out with?""

What's next?

The Board of County Commissioners is scheduled to have a board/staff work session to discuss the analysis around 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. ESCI will be giving a presentation. The county is then expected to hold a news conference to answer any questions.

Report: what went wrong with deadly...

Jurors convicted an East Naples man accused of driving under the influence and killing a woman in a 2014 crash after deliberating for a little over an hour on Monday.

Kiereek Seymour, 29, of East Naples, was charged with DUI manslaughter after an early morning crash at Lakewood and Davis boulevards in East Naples on May 19, 2014.

Sandra Marie Maddux, 54, of East Naples, died from injuries suffered in the crash.

Jurors began deliberations around 4:30 p.m. Monday and returned with the guilty verdict at 5:45 p.m.

The two-week trial began April 22 and was the second related to the DUI manslaughter charge brought against Seymour.

The first trial ended in February when Collier Circuit Judge Joseph Foster declared a mistrial after a juror came out of the jury room during deliberations and indicated she was feeling uncomfortable.

Seymour is set to be sentenced in front of Foster on June 26 at 3:30 p.m.

Both trials included conflicting assertions about whether Seymour was driving the vehicle he was found in, who was at fault in the crash and whether Seymour's blood-alcohol content was above 0.08, the legal limit for driving.

Assistant State Attorney Mara Marzano began her closing argument on Monday by telling the jurors that Maddux lost her life because Seymour was driving impaired due to the alcohol and alprazolam he had in his system at the time of the crash.

While Defense Attorney Peter Adrien said the state had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Seymour was driving the vehicle, was actually impaired or was at fault in the crash that killed Maddux.

Witness testimony proved Seymour was driving the vehicle involved in the crash with Maddux, Marzano said.

""There was never anyone else there,” Marzano said. “There was never any possibility that anyone else got out of that car and ran away.”

Seymour was found by witnesses positioned on the passenger side of the vehicle after the crash and it’s not the defense’s burden to prove who, if it wasn’t Seymour, was driving the vehicle, Adrien said.

Evidence collected by officers from the Florida Highway Patrol showed that Seymour was speeding and driving at least 62 mph at the time of the crash, while Maddux was driving 18 mph, Marzano said.

Adrien told the jurors the investigation by Florida Highway Patrol officers was not done properly and the speeds of the vehicles involved in the crash changed in various versions of the crash report.

Witness testimony also showed that Seymour had a yellow traffic signal and Maddux a red traffic signal, Adrien said.

In addition, Adrien said Maddux’s car had no lights on after the crash. Maddux could have been driving the dark vehicle at night with no lights, which could have contributed to the crash, he said.

However, Seymour’s slurred speech and medical records from the hospital after the crash prove he was impaired, Marzano told the jurors.

“Nowhere here does it say we have to prove he was falling down drunk,” Marzano said.

Seymour admitted to an emergency responder that he had a consumed one and a half beers before the crash and hospital staff recorded Seymour as clinically intoxicated and high, Marzano said.

The additive effect of alprazolam and alcohol impaired Seymour, Marzano said.

“I told you this was a complicated matter,” Marzano said. “I would suggest to you when you pare it down to what is real and not real you will find the defendant guilty.""

Adrien said none of the testing or evidence presented by the state proved that Seymour was over the 0.08 blood-alcohol level limit.

""The defendant is not guilty and this was a horrible accident,” Adrien said. “How could he be? He was following all the traffic rules.”

Even before February’s mistrial, Seymour had been in court before to face charges related to the crash that killed Maddux.

The state attorney's office refiled the DUI manslaughter charge in 2016 after then-Collier Circuit Judge Fred Hardt vacated an earlier plea agreement.

The negotiated plea agreement related to charges stemming from a Marco Island crash and charges from the crash involving Maddux. Hardt wrote that he had to vacate all sentences in the two cases.

At a hearing in June 2016, Seymour’s attorneys argued that the officer’s sirens were not activated during the pursuit of Seymour in the Marco Island incident, court documents show.

In an August 2016 order to vacate the sentence, Hardt agreed with Seymour’s attorneys, writing that “the officer’s dash cam clearly demonstrates that his siren was not activated.”

Seymour was back at the Collier County Courthouse in April 2018 for a jury trial to face charges in the Marco Island incident.

After deliberating for four hours and returning for four more hours on a second day, six jurors found Seymour guilty on all charges related to the Marco Island incident on April 27, 2018.

However, in May 2018, Seymour was granted a new trial in that case after testimony revealed jurors found a law book left behind in the jury room and used it to deliberate.

The book had been left behind by a bailiff who was studying for the sergeant’s exam, the bailiff testified during the hearing in which Seymour was granted a new trial.

A new jury trial in the case related to the Marco Island incident is set to begin July 1 at 9 a.m. at the Collier County Courthouse.

540,Students give touching sendoff to 'waving granny',"Vancouver Island, British Columbia (WFLA/CNN)- An elderly woman in Vancouver Island, British Columbia, waved to students from her window for years. They gathered outside her home for one final send-off before she moves into an independent living facility.

Tinney Davidson is now 88 years old, but around 2007 when she and her husband moved into the home on Guthrie Road near Highland they just started waving to the students every day and the students began waving back and a bond between generations was born.

Tinney maintained the daily practice and the children even held a Valentine's Day assembly in her honor just to show how much they appreciated her.

""I just like the look of the children and they all looked in-and I thought well, if they're looking in I'll wave to them. And that's how it started,"" Davidson said.

When the children became aware that ""Waving Granny"" was moving into an assisted living home, they again showed up to repay her for her kindness. 400 students at the nearby secondary school congregated on Davidson's front lawn to say goodbye. The children gave her flowers and let her know just how much her kindness has meant to them.

""I think I've connected very well with them (laughs). It's been fun,"" Tinney said. It's not often you see a bond like this between teenagers and the elderly.",https://www.wfla.com/news/viral-news/students-give-touching-sendoff-to-waving-granny-/1980602949,2019-05-05T15:13:47Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

544,Videos show deputies in action in Monroe County,"<p>On a Sunday evening in March, Monroe County Sheriff's Office deputies rushed to a house in Key Largo after receiving a 911 call about a medical emergency there.</p>

<p>By time deputies arrived, they heard a man yelling for help. The woman inside ""had no pulse, was not breathing, and her face was blue,"" deputies reported.</p>

<p>""She had a pulse... she's going back down,"" one deputy said on body camera video.</p>

<p>After performing CPR and placing automated external defibrillator (AED) pads on the woman, both deputies on scene administered Narcan, the medication used to reverse opioid overdose.</p>

<p>In minutes, the woman regained a heartbeat and began breathing on her own.</p>

<p>That night was one of many that sticks with Deputy Ignacio Molina, one of the deputies who helped save her life.</p>

<p>Molina, deployed five times with the Marines and now working in the Sheriff's Office Upper Keys unit, said calls in the Keys range from drug and alcohol related crimes, crashes, property crimes, to the occasional violent incident.</p>

<p>""Drunk driving is a big, big thing here,"" Molina said.</p>

<p>On a night a Local 10 crew rode with Molina, during his 6p.m. to 6a.m. shift, Molina pulled over a car speeding on the Overseas Highway. He said he smelled marijuana in the car and asked to search the driver's bag, where he found suspected joints.</p>

<p>""There it is - positive for marijuana,"" Molina said after performing a field test on the substance.</p>

<p>He let the driver go with a notice to appear.</p>

<p>In the course of the night, Molina also pulled over a swerving car, which ended up being full of lost tourists. He pulled over a man on a golf cart illegally driving on the pedestrian path along U.S. 1, who had a suspended license and a warrant, according to records.</p>

<p>He also deftly dealt with a tourist at a swanky resort, suspected of being unruly and drunk. Molina convinced him to go back to his room and order food.</p>

<p>And around midnight, he stopped a man on a bicycle with a chainsaw that was suspected to be stolen property. But saving lives, like on that night in March, is one of a law enforcement officer's most important jobs.</p>

<p>Deputies in the Keys have been carrying Narcan for the last two years, according to a department spokesman. School Resource Officers now carry the potent drug as well.</p>

<p>""It feels good. It gives you a sense of:  'this is why I do the job.'"" Molina said.</p>

545,Judge denies bail for accused Volusia County serial rapist,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - The charges are stacking up for an accused serial rapist, 44-year-old Markeith Martin, who stood quiet in Volusia County court Friday facing new sexual battery charges.

Friday's court appearance was a stark contrast from earlier this week when Martin shouted, ""I didn't do nothing that they said.""



Daytona Beach police said the convicted felon raped at least three women, one in 2017 and two in 2018. DNA evidence linked the accused serial rapist to the latest sexual assault cases that were released Thursday, according to police.



Investigators said a 31-year-old woman met Martin at a 7-Eleven convenience store on Ridgewood Avenue back in July 2017 and followed him and a woman to the Royal Inn Motel, where Martin gave the victim marijuana. Police said once Martin was alone with the victim, he ""grabbed her by the throat and forced her to the bed,"" where he sexually assaulted her. The woman finally escaped and called authorities.



Another attack happened in July 2018. Martin approached the 36-year-old woman on Ridgewood Avenue, where investigators said he told her, ""Come here"" and brandished a knife. Martin reportedly forced her into the woods, where he raped and beat her repeatedly, before bringing her back her to the same motel, where police said he raped her again.



Martin is currently accused of six sexual assaults in Daytona Beach and one in Holly Hill. So far, he's facing charges for three of those cases. His public defender argued for a bond today, but the state said there wasn't a safe bond for him as he's a danger to society. He remains behind bars for now.



The state attorney's office said there could be additional charges filed against Martin in the future.

Police said they were called to a beach on North Ocean Shore Boulevard around noon by a woman who said she saw a man, later identified as Kenneth Andrews, 52, inappropriately touching himself while staring at her.

When officers arrived, they said they watched and recorded video for about 30 minutes as Andrews laid on his back with his legs open, touching himself through his swim bottoms, which were pulled up so high that he was nearly exposed, according to the report.

Andrews made statements that he ""knew better"" and was only making sure that he was ""not hanging out"" as officers arrested him then later at the police station, he made comments about women showing up to the beach in thongs, the affidavit said.

The woman who called 911 was able to identify Andrews as the man she saw on the beach, according to authorities.

He faces a charge of lewd and lascivious exhibition.

548,"Evicted 90-year-old woman gets violent, refuses to leave home, police say","MELBOURNE, Fla. - A 90-year-old woman who was recently evicted got violent and refused to leave the home where she used to live, according to the Melbourne Police Department.

Police said they were called to a home on Oxford Avenue Thursday morning because Maria Bailey, 90, was screaming, demanding to be let inside and ignoring the property owner's requests for her to leave.

Court records show that a judge ruled on April 25 that Bailey should be evicted.

The landlord said Bailey broke a laundry room window by throwing a bucket at it and was kicking the house before officers arrived, according to the report.

An officer who tried to question Bailey said she kept pulling on the handle of the door to the laundry room door in an attempt to get in. She continued yelling and claiming the landlord broke some of her belongings as the officer escorted her to the front of the home, the affidavit said.

The landlord opened the door of the home to show the officer any damage, and Bailey rushed inside and refused to leave, according to authorities.

She sat down on a couch, grabbed the officer's hand and tugged her arm away in an attempt to not be handcuffed, the report said.

Police said Bailey continued to yell as she was placed in the back of a patrol vehicle.

She was arrested on charges of burglary to a dwelling, criminal mischief and resisting an officer without violence.

557,Meghan Markle and 7 other American princesses who had a royal baby,"CLOSE With the birth of Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's royal baby, enjoy looking back at these historic royal births, from the 1940s to today. USA TODAY

Nearly a year after her wedding to Prince Harry, the Duchess Meghan of Sussex gave birth to her first child. Buckingham Palace said the boy arrived early this morning, weighing 7 pounds and 3 ounces.

A statement said the family, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Prince William and Duchess Kate and Harry's maternal aunts and uncle, have all been informed and ""are delighted with the news.""

The Duchess, better known as Meghan Markle, was born and raised in Los Angeles. Her newborn son is now seventh in line for the throne, right behind his father, Harry. The child is also the first ever mixed-race baby born into the royal family.

That said, the baby is not the first royal with an American mother.

Rita Hayworth

American actress Rita Hayworth wed Italian-born Indian Prince Aly Khan, son of the Aga Khan in 1949. They were married four years. (Photo: AP)

The actress was best known for her roles in films like ""Gilda"" and ""The Lady from Shanghai"" in the 1940s. But in 1949, Rita Hayworth left Hollywood behind to marry Prince Aly Khan, son of the leader of Nizārī Ismaili Muslims. She met him a year prior at the Cannes Film Festival.

They had both been married before, Khan once before and Hayworth twice, most recently to Orson Welles in a marriage that lasted from 1943 to 1947.

She gave birth to a daughter at the end of 1949, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan. Hayworth had previously given birth to another daughter fathered by Orson Welles. Her marriage to either child's father did not last.

Hayworth brought her daughter with her to Nevada to establish residency in order to qualify for a divorce, later saying there were threats against the child's life if the girl was not raised Muslim, according to a 1953 newspaper clipping. Hayworth said she wanted the child raised Christian.

The couple eventually divorced in 1953 but their daughter became her mother's caretaker as she suffered through Alzheimer's toward the end of her life.

Royals: Where will Harry and Meghan's child fit in the line of succession?

Grace Kelly

Another Hollywood actress left behind a successful career in the 1950s after appearing in films like ""Rear Window"" and ""Dial M for Murder."" Grace Kelly also met her future husband at the Cannes Film Festival.

After a year-long courtship, Kelly married Rainer III, Prince of Monaco in 1956. The wedding was televised to an audience of an estimated 30 million viewers, according to the book ""Planet Wedding.""

As Princess of Monaco, she gave birth to three children: Princess Caroline in 1957, Prince Albert in 1958 and Princess Stéphanie in 1965. Albert is the current reigning monarch of Monaco, the second-smallest country in the world after the Vatican.

Kelly died in 1982 in a car crash after suffering a stroke while driving with Stéphanie in the car. Her daughter survived the crash.

Caroline Lee Radziwill

The sister of First Lady Jackie Kennedy, Radziwill divorced another American, Michael Temple Canfield before marrying Polish Prince Stanisław Albrecht ""Stash"" Radziwiłł in 1959. The prince also divorced his second wife in order to wed the American socialite.

Her title became ""Her Serene Highness Princess Caroline Radziwill,"" and she gave birth to a boy, Anthony, in 1959 and a daughter, Anna Christina, in 1960. Neither made a career out of being a royal.

Born in San Francisco, Hope Cooke traveled to India while a freshman at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959. There, she met Palden Thondup Namgyal, the Crown Prince of Sikhism. He had two children, was nearly twice her age, and a widower, but in 1963, the two wed.

The marriage required Cooke to renounce her U.S. citizenship. She became Queen of Sikhism, giving birth to two children, Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. She was also a step-mother to her husband's other three children.

But political conflict with the nation of India ultimately led to the kingdom coming to an end in the 1970s. Cooke then traveled back to the U.S. with her two children, according to The New York Times. She was granted permanent residency in the U.S and later, divorced Mamgyal.

Lisa Halaby

Years after her grandfather immigrated to the U.S. from Syria, Halaby returned to the Middle East in the 1970s, meeting Hussein bin Talal, the King of Jordan. The two married in 1978, the King's fourth and final marriage.

Halaby took the royal name Noor Al-Hussein and converted to Islam. As Queen, she was step-mother to three of the King's children and gave birth to four more in the royal line:

Prince Hamzah in 1980, Prince Hashim in 1981, Princess Iman in 1983 and Princess Raiyah in 1986. Hamzah was Crown Prince of Jordan between 1999 to 2004 until his half-brother, King Abdullah II, removed him from the position. Abdullah has been King of the country since his father's death in 1999.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Maximum Security led the Kentucky Derby every step of the way except for the last one — into the winner’s circle.

The colt became the first winner disqualified for interference in the Derby’s 145-year history, leading to an agonizing wait and an eventual stunning reversal that made 65-1 shot Country House the winner Saturday.

Country House finished second in the slop before objections were raised, causing a 20-minute delay while three stewards repeatedly reviewed different video angles before they unanimously elevated him into the winner’s circle.

That gave Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott his first Derby victory at age 65.

“It’s bittersweet. You always want to win with a clean trip and have everybody recognize the horse as the very good horse and great athlete that he is,” Mott said. “Due to the disqualification, I think some of that is diminished.”

Jockey Flavien Prat, one of two jockeys who originated the claim of foul, also won his first Derby.

“I’m kind of speechless right now,” Prat said, letting out a long sigh.

Country House paid $132.40 to win — the second-highest payout in Derby history. He was the least affected horse in the chain of events, but the biggest beneficiary.

“Looking at the tote board there’s probably a lot of people that didn’t think we could win,” Mott said, “but that’s horse racing.”

Gary West, who owns Maximum Security with his wife, Mary, indicated they may pursue an appeal.

“I think this is the most egregious disqualification in the history of horse racing,” he told The Associated Press by phone, “and not just because it’s our horse.”

Country House was dismissed as a long shot with a bad post on the far outside. It was only the chestnut colt’s second win in seven career starts and his first stakes victory.

Maybe this was one for his father: Lookin At Lucky got saddled with the dreaded No. 1 post in the 2010 Derby, where he got pinned to the rail and wound up sixth. He rebounded to win the Preakness two weeks later.

The disqualification was a crushing turn of events for Maximum Security trainer Jason Servis and jockey Luis Saez, who already had begun celebrating what they thought were their first Derby victories.

Instead, previously undefeated Maximum Security was dropped to 17th of 19 horses for veering out turning for home and stacking up War of Will, Long Range Toddy and Bodexpress (also owned by the Wests), according to Barbara Borden, chief steward of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission. Country House, in turn, was brushed by Long Range Toddy.

Sent off as the 9-2 second choice, Maximum Security was placed behind all the horses that he bothered.

“I never put anybody in danger,” Saez said.

Servis backed up his jockey, saying: “He’s right. He straightened him up right away and I didn’t think it affects the outcome of the race.”

Prat claimed that Maximum Security ducked out in the final turn and forced several horses to steady, including Long Range Toddy, whose jockey, Jon Court, also lodged an objection. War of Will came perilously close to clipping heels with Maximum Security, which could have caused a chain-reaction accident.

“There were two horses in the race that lost all chance to win a Kentucky Derby,” Mott said. “They were in position at the time to hit the board. If what happened to us was the only thing they were looking at I don’t think you would have seen a disqualification.”

Mott said the incident was caused by Maximum Security’s action and not Saez’s riding tactics.

“I don’t think Luis Saez did anything intentionally,” the trainer said. “My heart actually aches for them a little bit. That’s the way it is. I’ve been on the other end of it, just not in the Kentucky Derby.”

The stewards reviewed race footage and interviewed the affected jockeys while keeping the crowd of 150,729 and millions more watching on television and online in suspense, clutching their betting tickets. Trainers and jockeys involved stared at the closest video screen waiting for a result.

“I know the stewards had a very, very difficult decision,” Mott said. “I’m damn glad they put our number up.”

Code of Honor was moved up to second and Tacitus — also trained by Mott — was third.

Improbable was fourth and Game Winner fifth, two of trainer Bob Baffert’s trio of entries. His other horse, Roadster, was 15th.

The last claim of foul by a jockey in the Derby was unsuccessful. John Velazquez, aboard runner-up Invisible Ink in 2001, alleged interference at the quarter pole against Monarchos and Jorge Chavez, who crossed the finish line 4¾ lengths in front. The stewards didn’t change the result.

The only other disqualification in the Derby occurred long after the race in 1968. Dancer’s Image, the first-place finisher, tested positive for a prohibited medication, and Kentucky state racing officials ordered the purse money to be redistributed. Forward Pass got the winner’s share. A subsequent court challenge upheld the stewards’ decision.

Country House wore the garland of red roses, but it’s possible the situation doesn’t end here. There could be appeals to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission or the courts.

“We are exploring our options to appeal,” West told the AP. “If we can’t appeal to the stewards, our other options are the state racing commission. If those don’t work, we might go to legal options.”

Mott hopes it doesn’t come to that.

“That’s a nightmare. It’s a no-win situation for anybody involved,” said Mott, who spoke with Servis after the reversal. “I didn’t get a hint of that from him. He’s been around long enough, and I’m sure he watched the films well enough. He knows what happened.”

The surprising flip threw a few bettors into a frenzy, too. Some who had wagered on Country House to win immediately tossed away their tickets at the finish, only to then scramble to the ground at Churchill Downs, frantically searching for their betting slips.

Master Fencer, the first Japan-bred to run in the Derby, was sixth. War of Will was seventh, followed by Plus Que Parfait, Win Win Win, Cutting Humor, By My Standards and Vekoma.

Bodexpress finished 13th, followed by Tax, Roadster, Long Range Toddy, Maximum Security, Spinoff and Gray Magician.

559,Source describes dramatic rescue after 737 skids into river,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Children were among the passengers pulled to safety overnight after a Boeing 737 charter flight overran a runway at Naval Air Station Jacksonville and slid into the shallow waters of the St. Johns River.

A source close to the NAS Jacksonville Fire Department described the rescue as chaotic and difficult because so many people needed to be pulled to shore.

But the firefighters were prepared. The NAS Jacksonville fire crew had about 20 members helping out, and 80 members of the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department responded to the scene.

They floated rafts in the water and pulled the passengers and crew members off the wings of the plane into the rafts, then pulled them to shore.

The firefighters helped them out of the rafts onto rocks and then to the safety of land.

Of the 143 on board, 23 were taken to area hospitals, including three children. All had been treated and released by Saturday morning, hospital officials confirmed.

""I want to thank the local community, thank first responders (and) the city of Jacksonville for the amazing support, as well as all the community organizations -- Red Cross -- that have come out and supported the Navy and the passengers,"" said Capt. Michael Connor, commanding officer of NAS Jacksonville.

Aviation expert Ed Booth said the situation could have been much worse had the plane not come to rest in the shallow waters of the river.

“This was the best-case scenario if the airplane had to overrun the runway,” Booth said.

No luggage was seen floating in the water, but leaking fuel was a concern.

568,"Here's why I support Recycle Brevard — and hope you'll want to be part of it, too","Buy Photo Recyclables whiz past on a conveyor belt inside Waste Management Recycling Brevard in Cocoa. (Photo: MALCOLM DENEMARK/FLORIDA TODAY)

I’ve been volunteering now with Recycle Brevard for more than five years. During that time it’s become clear to me that very few people realize just who Recycle Brevard really is and, more particularly, what Recycle Brevard does.

That fact was brought home in a big way during the recent back-and-forth on the ever-changing list of acceptable recyclable items through the county’s contract with Waste Management. I couldn’t believe the amount of complaints Recycle Brevard received having to do with what was or was not acceptable to be recycled through the county’s program and how many people blamed us for the county’s failure to notify them of changes.

More: Brevard County seeks ways to cut polystyrene use

So, let me try to clarify a few facts while explaining just why I love Recycle Brevard.

Recycle Brevard is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit that operates solely through volunteers — no one is paid. It was started back in 2011, when a mother responded to a question from her daughter about where their garbage goes. That mom realized in a big way that there was a void and she did something about it. That mom is Marcia Booth, who for the past eight years has put her own money into the organization. There is no funding from the county for her work, or from anyone else for that matter. She relies totally on sponsorships and donations, which are few and far between because most people think her work is funded by someone else.

This is a woman who personally goes through recyclables which she personally picks up from events, in her own personal vehicle, because a lot of people — a lot — don’t seem to know what goes into a recycling container. I’ve seen her pull dirty diapers out of recycling containers, along with all the other things that shouldn’t be in them. Marcia spends most weekends trekking back and forth from events, delivering recycling containers and picking them up. She works with schools doing educational programs on recycling because she is adamant that our youth are the answer to this whole recycling fiasco and she’s right about that.

As if all of that wasn’t enough, Marcia recently partnered with an international organization and is sponsoring environmental discussion courses at Recycle Brevard’s facility. She is pretty much a one-woman band. Go to recyclebrevard.org and you’ll find out all of the things this woman does. She’s also incredibly humble when it comes to her work in the community and she is also well respected for that work. The way that Recycle Brevard is funded is through Marcia’s own money. She works a full time job in addition to running Recycle Brevard, and has a husband who is very supportive of her passion. That is how the lights stay on at Recycle Brevard.

Organizations such as Recycle Brevard aren’t found too often and that’s why I love it so much. People who volunteer here are passionate about what they do, partly because they’re inspired by its founder.

Things in the recycling world are getting harder. This country has dug itself into a huge hole and the time is fast approaching when individuals are going to have to make some significant changes to their personal habits. We no longer have a far-off country that will take all of our garbage to make it more convenient for us. Fewer and fewer items are going to be recycled because there is no longer any market for them. We need organizations that are passionate about what they do and who work to educate people about they can do to make things better.

So, the next time you get aggravated or angry at what is or is no longer recyclable, please know that Recycle Brevard is doing everything in its power to help folks out. It’s the one making comprehensive lists online because people complained that there wasn’t one out there and said that they couldn’t get a straight answer anywhere else, And Marcia Booth is the one going through the containers pulling out things that shouldn’t be in there.

Recycle Brevard can always use help — always. If you're interested, maybe consider volunteering for three hours a month or so yourself to help the cause.

PORT RICHEY, Fla (WFLA) - A Port Richey woman arrested on a child abuse charge is now free on bond.

When News Channel 8 approached 38-year-old Latoya Dortch about her arrest, she had no comment and rushed back into her home.

Investigators say she and the victim got into an argument at a home on Lancelot Road in Port Richey.

That's when they say she kicked him out and locked the door.

He broke into the house to retreive his seizure medication, which he has to take at certain hours of the day. He then left the home and started walking down the street.

Detectives say Dortch got behind the wheel of her 2018 Nissan Rogue and went after him.

""The suspect attempted to strike the victim several times, not just once. And again we have a witness who saw this occur multiple times, not just once,"" said Amanda Hunter, sheriff's office spokeswoman.

Shakayla Denson was ruled incompetent last year to stand trial and the case couldn't continue until she got mental treatment, but now she’s back in the county jail ahead of Friday’s court hearing.

Court documents indicate doctors finished an evaluation and could have an update on the case Friday.

Police Chief Brian Dugan called the whole thing, “tragic, chaotic, and unbelievable.”

Witnesses saw Denson steal a car from a car lot and shoved her daughter Je'Hyrah into the back seat.

Police said Denson then drove to the river, dragged her screaming daughter out of the car and walked into the water.

Witnesses also saw Denson pull Je'Hyra in for a hug, release her daughter into the water, turned and walked away.

But that’s what happened last night at a dollar store in Pensacola, and it resulted in the arrest of a woman for child neglect.

According to a press release from the Florida Highway Patrol, the woman, Cassady N. Ellis, no age or city of residence given, parked her Dodge SUV at the Dollar Tree at 8992 Pensacola Boulevard and went inside the store, leaving a 6-year-old, 4-year-old and 3-year-old in the vehicle.

While Ellis was in the store the 6-year-old took control of the SUV and backed it out of the parking spot, then drove it forward, hitting 2010 Dodge Charger parked next to it. The SUV then came to rest against a tree in the parking lot.

All three kids were uninjured and no significant damage was done to either vehicle.

590,Central Florida refuge celebrates 30 years of helping wildlife,"OSCEOLA COUNTY, Fla. - Thirty years ago, a Central Florida woman's dream was to have a place where rescued wildlife could be treated and nurtured back into their habitat.

Today, that dream continues to be fulfilled in Osceola County, coupled with education.

""Teaching people how to live and understand Florida wildlife is crucial,"" Kelly Verduin said.

She's been working with wildlife animals for about 16 years at the Back to Nature Wildlife Refuge.

""Anything from squirrels to possums, raccoons, your common backyard wildlife,"" Verduin, an administrative manager, said. ""Some are exotic that we've housed from other sanctuaries and live with us permanently now, and some were perhaps initially a patient that came in that we were treating but unfortunately wasn't able to be returned.""

The nonprofit organization started three decades ago out of a Central Florida woman's love for animals.

""This literally started in the backyard of Carmen Shaw, who is our founder of Back to Nature. She grew up even doing this with her father of just finding wildlife and helping it until they could put it back out,"" Verduin said.

Since then, the refuge has been providing a safe haven for about 3,000 animals each year.

""Most of the time, they've been either attacked by a domestic animal or they've been hit by a car,"" Verduin said.

There are currently 19 species and 22 enclosures housing everthing from bobcats to tortoises to an emu and even a few laid-back lemurs.

The facility operates solely on donations and with help from volunteers.

Among the permanent residents is 12-year-old Nigel, a sherman fox squirrel with an amputated paw.

""They are a Florida native species of special concern, which is one above being listed as threatened. Nigel came to us in 2007, when he was found unconscious in the Lake Mary area after being electrocuted by a transformer box,"" Verduin said.

Nigel has surpassed his lifetime expectations.

""Every day, these animals have to be tended to, not just feeding them and cleaning them, they also have to be enriched. Their lives are in an enclosure. They do have impairments, they have special needs. They do get different forms of enrichment so every day they have a different activity that's created for them,"" Verduin said.

The organization is only getting busier. Every day, someone walks in with an injured or abandoned animal.

""With the growing developments around us, the population is continuously growing. The majority of people that are coming from places elsewhere that are not familiar with Florida, it's just so important to have a resource like this,"" Verduin said.

On Saturday, there will be a big celebration for the organization's 30th anniversary. The event takes places from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

591,"DNA connects suspected Volusia serial rapist to 2 more cases, police say","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - A Volusia County man suspected in a series of rapes in the area since 2010 was charged Thursday in connection with two additional sexual battery attacks, according to Daytona Beach police.

According to Daytona Beach and Holly Hill police, Markeith Martin, 44, is suspected in seven attacks from 2010 to 2018. Martin often made his victims call him ""New York,"" according to the police reports.

Charges were filed Thursday in connection with rapes that occurred in Daytona Beach in July 2017 and July 2018.

On July 27, 2017, the victim said she met Martin and another woman at a 7-Eleven on South Ridgewood Avenue and went back with them to their hotel room where they smoked some marijuana, according to the police report.

When the other woman left the room, Martin took off his clothes and told the victim to do the same. When she said no, he stripped her clothes off and raped her, according to the report. When she attempted to leave, she said, Martin grabbed her by the throat and choked her.

Police said Martin later denied the allegations because he “never offers anyone marijuana.”

The victim told police she was able to leave when she told Martin she would go out and “mail him money.” She left and called police when she went home, according to the report.

A rape kit was completed at Halifax Medical Hospital and evidence was sent to the FDLE lab. The FDLE completed a lab report in September 2017, and investigators said they found a match for Martin's DNA from another rape in August 2017.

In the July 2018 case, authorities said the victim was walking on Beach Street around 8 p.m. when Martin approached her, brandished a pocket knife and said, ""If you leave my side, I'll kill you, (expletive).""

He dragged her into a wooded area, choked her, punched her and repeatedly raped her while forcing her to tell him that she loved him and threatening to kill her for screaming, according to the report.

After the assault, authorities said Martin forced the woman to a hotel room where he raped her again. She escaped to call 911 when he fell asleep, the report said.

Martin was in custody for another sexual battery case in which he was accused of raping a woman who's bicyclwhen investigators used DNA to link him to the July 2017 and July 2018 cases. Martin remains in the Volusia County Jail held without bail.

595,"Home health employee who raped blind woman could have more victims, deputies say","SEMINOLE COUNTY, Fla. - An employee of a home health care company raped a blind woman for more than an hour then tried to tell deputies that he was blackmailed into doing it, according to the Seminole County Sheriff's Office.

The victim, a blind woman in her 50s, used BrightStar Care medical staffing to help her out with chores and other things at her home in unincorporated Longwood but when she was unhappy with the aide provided, she contacted sales manager Gregory Porras to provide her with a different employee, the report said.

On Tuesday morning, Porras went to the home to discuss providing the woman with a different aide but as they were speaking, Porras began making inappropriate advances, authorities said.

The victim pulled away when Porras tried to hold her hand then later he asked her to stand up so she could try to guess his height based on hers and that's when he grabbed her and kissed her, according to the affidavit.

Deputies said the victim repeatedly said no but she couldn't stop him from raping her for more than hour. Once the assault was over, Porras got dressed and spoke to the victim about replacing the aide in her home as if nothing happened, the report said.

Evidence at the scene and an examination were consistent with the information the victim provided, according to authorities.

Deputies said they interviewed Porras at BrightStar Care in Lake Mary and he offered several conflicting explanations about what happened, including saying that he was using male enhancement pills and that he was blackmailed into doing what he did.

Eventually, deputies said Porras provided details that matched the ones the victim provided.

Porras is facing two counts of sexual battery, one count of crimes against a disabled adult and one count of an employee having sex with a disability client. He posted $108,000 bond Thursday morning and has since been released from the Seminole County Jail.

Deputies said they are concerned that Porras could have more victims. Anyone with information about Porras is asked to call Seminole County Sheriff's Office investigator Lilliam Agrinsoni at 407-665-6945.

After being alerted by a passerby Tuesday that a couple appeared to be ready to fornicate in front of the Key West Police Station, an officer caught the man and woman in action, so to speak.

The man, Gary Hill, was found with his shorts down around his ankles; while the woman, Crystal Frances, was wearing neither pants or underwear.

When the officer asked the couple what they were doing, Hill replied, ""It was a Key West moment.""

While Hill followed the officer's orders and put his clothes back on, Frances refused, leading to the officer to believe she was intoxicated.

Without being prompted, Hill blurted out to the officer, ""I'm horny"" and admitted the couple had drank a pint of vodka earlier in the evening. A bottle of vodka was found next to the spot where Hill and Frances were having sex.

Hill was arrested and charged with Lewd & Lascivious Indecent Exposure | Having sex in public, while Frances was taken to the hospital. Once she is released from the hospital, a warrant is expected to be issued for her arrest.

600,Help 'Stamp Out Hunger' on Saturday,"Donations made locally through the nation's largest single-day food drive will remain in Marion County.

Got an extra can of beans, or some peanut butter and jelly? Someone else could use it. Actually, lots of others could use a bag of groceries.

Single moms trying to feed their children. Someone who lost a job and is now homeless. A man or woman who is simply down on their luck. These are all examples of people who visit area help agencies, food banks and soup kitchens on a daily basis.

On Saturday, area residents can help the needy in Marion County by placing bags of non-perishable food items on mailboxes for collection by local letter carriers.

The second Saturday of May is collection day for the annual National Association of Letter Carriers Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive. This is the 27th year for what has become the nation's largest single-day food drive. The food collected in Marion County will remain here to help local people.

To learn more, we did this question and answer session with Timothy Legge, a letter carrier and the local drive organizer; Karla Grimsley, executive director of Interfaith Emergency Services; and Jessica Nisbett, donor relations director for United Way of Marion County.

TIMOTHY LEGGE

Question: Marion County has long been a national leader in collections for the drive. How do you think this year will compare to past drives?

Answer: Donations locally have been in a downtrend the last few years. The biggest change this year is that Farm Share (Farmshare.org) has stepped up and provided plastic food drive bags for the entire state of Florida. Every resident should be receiving one of these bags in their mailbox before Friday. We are hoping that this serves as another reminder to donate and helps to reverse the trend.

Our carriers and volunteers are ready, and we would like to see a donation in every mailbox this year. Donations can also be dropped off at your local post office.

Q: How many letter carriers will be collecting items Saturday in Marion County?

A: There will be hundreds of Marion County rural and city carriers in 19 offices participating in this year's food drive.

Q: What kinds of food are needed?

A: Lists what type of items can be donated can be found at this website: www.nalc.org/community-service/food-drive/frequently-asked-questions.

Q: Some of the annual postcards announcing the date were distributed last week and some people placed donations on their mailboxes last Saturday. Is the food being stored for addition to the drive on Saturday?

A: Some routes began delivering the cards as early as last Thursday but most residents in Marion County will be receiving them this week. Many residents have already given their donations to their carriers, and we appreciate that. We are getting these donations to Interfaith as we receive them.

KARLA GRIMSLEY

Question: How many agencies will this food go to?

Answer: It goes to all of Interfaith’ s pantries (Ocala, Fellowship, Fort McCoy, Marion Oaks, Dunnellon and Reddick) as well as nine other local agencies and churches countywide, including Brothers Keeper, Salvation Army, His Compassion, St. Theresa’s, Gateway to Hope and the Help Agency of the Forest. Basically, those agencies who come and help that day get to take a portion of the food.

Q: What is the impact of this drive on area families?

A: This drive is the saving grace for the summer months. You have families with children who were getting food at school during the week that now have to come up with more meals and utility bills running high due to the summer heat, so families are stretched. These families will need assistance to make ends meet and without this food drive Interfaith definitely wouldn’t be able to meet the needs of everyone coming to us in the summer months.

Q: What else can people do to help at other times of the year?

A: Volunteer in the pantry; donate money to help us keep lights on and trucks running that pick-up food throughout the year; and ask your church, civic group or neighborhood to hold a food drive. If you collect the food, Interfaith will come and pick it up. Call 629-8868, ext. 212, for a food pick-up and ext. 207 to learn about becoming a volunteer.

Note that this one day of the year our letter carriers go above and beyond the call of duty to help needy families in this county. They are the real heroes of the day. It is a long, back-breaking day for them. Leave a note of encouragement or thanks on your mailbox.

JESSICA NISBETT

Question: How is this drive important to United Way of Marion County programs?

Answer: Many of United Way of Marion County’s internal and funded programs help support families and individuals who take advantage of the generous donations provided through this annual food drive.

Hunger is a major barrier to success for children, adults and seniors in Marion County. Imagine how difficult it must be for a student to focus when their belly is empty, or an adult attempting to be productive when their mind may be focused on where their next meal will come from.

Without this drive, many could go hungry as our local food pantries run low, so it is critical to the overall success of our community to give back and ensure that our neighbors have one of their most basic needs met. Each year, our community does an outstanding job to rally around our most vulnerable and exemplify what it means to Live United.

Q: Will you have volunteers working on the drive?

A: United Way of Marion County supports the drive through public awareness efforts, ensuring that our community is aware of the opportunity to give back through this annual effort and helping to recruit volunteers to pick-up or sort food the day-of.

Q: What are other ways people can help your mission?

A: United Way of Marion County allows you to find your voice and fight to make a difference for what is most meaningful to you. We are a partner of choice for individuals and businesses in our community as they give, advocate and volunteer for causes that they are passionate about.

603,All Incarcerated People Deserve What Michael Cohen Is Getting,"Photo: Jonathan Carroll/AP

Today, former Trump lawyer and massive idiot Michael Cohen is going to prison. This is a pretty astonishing fact, considering how much power this slime ball had until just a few years ago, and it’s tempting to take it as a victory and then forget about it.



But it seems that Cohen isn’t going to the kind of place you envision when you think “federal prison.” The prison where Cohen will be serving out his three-year sentence for bank fraud and campaign finance violations, the Federal Correctional Institute in Otisville, NY, is pretty damn nice.

Advertisement

“He’s going to what I like to refer to as ‘Jewish heaven,’” Larry Levine, a former convict for racketeering who spent ten years in prison and who founded the truly grotesque organization Wall Street Prison Consultants, told Reuters.

Otisville has a commissary list online that includes a variety of kosher foods, from matzoh ball soup to gefilte fish to the Jewish pastry rugelach. According to Reuters, the grounds feature amenities like a bocce ball court and tennis court. If inmates need spiritual advice, the prison employs a full-time rabbi. Inmates are given jobs like cleaning, which they are expected to perform for a few hours a day. But most of the time, they get to sit around and do whatever. Furloughs for weekends home are commonly granted. There isn’t even a barrier around the prison’s perimeter.

It hardly needs to be said that this isn’t the norm in the U.S. criminal justice system, which treats most people who pass through it with horrifying brutality.

Advertisement

For example: earlier this week, a mentally ill woman named Tammy Jackson gave birth unassisted in an isolation cell at a Florida jail. She asked for help from guards when her contractions began, but they ignored her.

Jackson was arrested earlier this year on cocaine possession charges. She was subsequently released, but arrested again when she didn’t report for her pretrial services. Like 76 percent of those held in local jails, Jackson hasn’t been convicted of any crime. Broward County Chief Assistant Public Defender Gordon Weekes described her mental health problems as “significant.”

After Jackson gave birth alone and totally unassisted, the sheriff’s office told the Miami Herald that they called Child Protective Services and that the child was “placed with an appropriate caregiver.” It’s unclear whether or not Jackson is still in jail.

It’s easy to react to this kind of deep injustice by wishing Cohen was just stuck in any old regular prison, where he’d have to personally experience some of the horror to which most people are subjected, not to mention a jail like the one where Jackson was forced to bleed and scream alone, waiting for hours as no one helped her. But the truth is that no one, not convicted criminals, not even former Trump allies, deserves that kind of treatment.

Instead of seeking retribution for Cohen’s unequal treatment, what if we made every prison more like Otisville and much less like Broward County Jail? What if we treated incarcerated people like human beings, providing a setting where those who have done harm can reflect on their actions instead of constantly worrying about being raped or killed? What if we stopped criminalizing poverty? What if we adequately funded mental health and substance abuse treatment? What if we legalized drugs and ended cash bail so people like Jackson never ended up in jail in the first place?

Our country can feel pretty dark. Jackson’s story shows that it’s already a horror movie for some of us. But we cannot improve it by merely spreading brutality more equitably. Personally, I don’t really care what happens to Cohen—I’m sure he’ll be fine regardless. But I would love to live in a society where what happened to Jackson never happens to anyone else ever again.",https://splinternews.com/all-incarcerated-people-deserve-what-michael-cohen-is-g-1834543345,2019-05-06T12:21:00Z,Splinter,"8551 NW 30th Terrace, Doral, FL 33122",FL,33122

605,Man killed during internet cafe robbery was US Marine,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The girlfriend of a man who was shot while trying to thwart a robbery at a Jacksonville internet cafe is praying for a quick arrest.

Lisa Fighter said her boyfriend, Douglas Cox, a U.S. Marine, did what he could to save a life, but lost his own life in the process. She said Cox was killed while trying to stop an armed robber Wednesday evening at the Dream Arcade on Edgewood Avenue.

""He's gone,"" Fighter said. ""He isn't going to make anybody laugh or smile or giggle anymore.""

Fighter relived the moment she learned what happened.

""We (were) going to McDonald's and we came across and saw the cops and our friends' SUV that they were in,"" Fighter said. ""He just looked at me and I could tell. I hit my knees and he said he was gone. There's nothing more that could be done.""

Cox, 47, was a regular at the Dream Arcade. Barry Jackson was there on the night of the shooting and called his friend's actions heroic.

""They were going to go in there and kill that woman, and he jumped in,"" Jackson said. ""Got the bullet before she did.""

According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, only one employee was inside the internet cafe at the time and no one else was injured.

""He died doing what he believed in,"" Fighter said.

The deadly shooting is one recent example in a string of violence at Jacksonville internet cafes. Early Friday morning, the Wilson Arcade on Wilson Boulevard was robbed by two masked gunmen.

As of Thursday night, no arrests were announced. Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 904-630-0500 or email JSOCrimeTips@jaxsheriff.org. To remain anonymous, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-866-845-TIPS (8477).

607,Newborn in intensive care after mom of 4 dies during childbirth,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Resting inside Wolfsons Children's Hospital next to his father is newborn Matthew Jr. As he was coming into the world, his mother, Lauren Accurso, was leaving unexpectedly during childbirth.

As her husband, daughters and church family grieve, they pray baby Matthew survives.

The family's pastor, Matt McCloghry, recalled the moment he learned something went wrong during Accurso's fourth childbirth.

""(It was) very sudden, really, just through text message and a phone: Something is happening, and we need to pray,"" McCloghry said. ""It was really shortly thereafter a group of us went down to the hospital, and we heard the news.""

McCloghry has pastored the Accurso family since he opened his church three years ago.

As Matthew Jr. and his father continue to bond in the neonatal intensive care unit, their pastor and their church are praying endlessly.

It's unclear what led to Accurso's death, but it was described as an unpreventable and rare medical condition.

Though Matthew Jr. will not grow up with his mother, there are many memories that others, like his father, sisters and McCloghry, can share about Accurso, who was a wife, mother, friend and believer -- a woman who had a bright smile and a caring heart.

""Her personality was just lovely,"" McCloghry said. ""She was so bubbly. She was an incredible wife and incredible mom but she was a strong believer.""

McCloghry believes Accurso, the kind mother of four, is resting peacefully in heaven.

A donation account was created to support the Accurso family. As of Friday evening, $125,000 had been raised.

609,Chevy vs. Ford argument leads to shooting at family dinner,"Three people in Virgina were hurt in a family argument-turned-shooting, and it all stemmed from a debate over which was the superior auto manufacturer: Chevy or Ford.

At least they can agree on their support for the American car industry, right?

All jokes aside, none of the three victims suffered life-threatening injuries. And Mark Edwin Turner, 56, has been charged with felony malicious wounding, the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and possession of a firearm by a felon, according to WSET-TV, in Lynchuburg, which cited the Bedford County Sheriff's Office.

A 911 call reporting the shooting came in around 11:30 p.m. April 22.

Prior to the gunfire, Turner, his girlfriend, her son and her son's girlfriend were having dinner before the Easter holiday, Bedford County Commonwealth's Attorney Wes Nance said.

""The allegation is that there was alcohol involved and a dispute began against Logan Bailey, the son of the girlfriend, and Mr. Turner about what type of vehicle is best -- Chevy vs. Ford,"" Nance said.

The argument, and the subsequent shooting, took place in the front yard, officials said.

Nance said Turner pulled out a knife and his girlfriend tried to intervene.

Nance said the woman was struck with the knife, which caused about a 6-inch wound, according to the news station.

Turner, at some point, went into the home and came back outside with a gun, officials said.

One person was shot five times in the legs, another victim was shot in the arm and a third was hit by two bullets that Nance said ricocheted.

Deputies arrived at the home, located the victims then hit Turner with a bean bag round before his eventual arrest, which took place after a standoff.

There's no word on which Turner preferred: Ford or Chevy? Either way, safe to say, perhaps we could have just ""agreed to disagree.""

610,Deputies release name of suspect they are searching for in Seminole County burglary,"SEMINOLE COUNTY, Fla. - A large law enforcement response is underway in Seminole County as deputies look for a possible shooting suspect near Sanford.

According to deputies, a person returned to their home on Virginia Avenue in unincorporated Altamonte Springs at 1:15 p.m. to find two people in the home.

Deputies said one of those people was armed and the homeowner shot at the suspects. No one was injured.

The suspects fled the home and deputies spotted their vehicle in the area of I-4 and Lake Mary Boulevard. They abandoned their four-door sedan near the Dunwoody Plaza on State Road 46 at International Parkway.

Deputies have a man and a woman in custody.

Investigators are still looking for Daquon Atkins.

Deputies said he is considered armed and dangerous. He has two active warrants out of Seminole County and Volusia County.

People who live near Dunwoody Plaza said they're concerned.

""Obviously it’s a little scary when you come home and see all of this action,"" Christy Prickard said. ""It’s scary, very scary. I walk up here all the time, so of course you don’t want to see all of this in neighborhood.""

Helicopters have circled the woods looking for the suspect. Neighbors said there has been several burglaries in the area.

611,Caught on video: Tallahassee Police investigating two week-old armed robberies,"CLOSE TPD's Violent Crimes Unit is investigating an Armed Robbery at Arcade Center on North Martin Luther King Blvd. Tallahassee Police Department

The Tallahassee Police Department is investigating two armed robberies that happened an hour and a half apart the night of April 26 on two different sides of town.

TPD posted dramatic video Thursday afternoon on Twitter of a robbery that happened around 9 p.m. at the Arcade Center, 1889 N. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.

The video, nearly a minute and a half long, shows a man walking into the business and firing a gun into the ceiling as he approached the front desk clerk and demanded money.

The man tried to fire the gun several times before it finally went off, startling a customer who was standing right next to him. Customers appeared oblivious to the gunman at first, though they later put their heads down on the tables in front of them. No injuries were reported.

The other incident, an armed mugging, happened around 10:30 p.m. outside the CVS Pharmacy, 5466 Thomasville Road, according to a heavily redacted police report.

A woman tried to fend off the mugger in the drug store parking lot, but her attacker made off with a wallet containing her credit cards. She told officers someone pointed a gun in her face and demanded she hand over her purse. She was not injured, according to the TPD report.

A Good Samaritan later found the woman's wallet and returned it to her. He posted on the Next Door website that she initially refused to give the mugger her purse but turned it over after realizing he had a gun. The mugger got into a car that sped away.

TPD didn't post any information about the mugging on its Facebook or Twitter pages and didn't issue a press release. Citizens have complained to city commissioners, the Police Department and the Tallahassee Democrat about the fact the mugging was not publicized.

No arrests have been made in either incident. Both remain under investigation.

612,Miami-Dade police officer in rough arrest to face criminal charges,"<p>Authorities have arrested a Miami-Dade County police officer who was recorded getting into a struggle with a woman after she had reported a crime.</p>

<p>Officer Alejandro Giraldo faces charges of official misconduct and battery.</p>

<p>""After taking the sworn statements ... and reviewing all the known video evidence, we believe that there is sufficient evidence to charge a violation of Florida's criminal statues,"" prosecutors said in a statement.</p>

<p>Dyma Loving said a neighbor pulled a gun on her while she was walking in southwest Miami-Dade County in early March. Loving called police for help, but when Giraldo arrived, she and Giraldo started to argue. Giraldo eventually grabbed her by the neck, forced Loving to the ground and arrested her. A bystander recorded the incident using a mobile phone.</p>

<p>The Miami-Dade Police Department also released video from Giraldo's body camera. After video of the arrest attracted widespread attention, the department relieved Giraldo of duty, calling the incident ""deeply troubling.""</p>

<p>""An arrest of one of our own is disappointing, and overshadows the hard work of the dedicated men and women of law enforcement, who strive daily to serve and protect our community,"" Miami-Dade County police Director Juan Perez said in a statement. ""This particular case underscores our commitment to cooperate and work together with the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office in our continued effort to hold ourselves accountable.""</p>

<p>Loving, 26, was initially charged with disorderly conduct and resisting an officer without violence, but those charges were later dropped. She is pursuing a civil lawsuit against Giraldo.</p>

<p>In the arrest report, prosecutors rebutted Giraldo's explanations for why he arrested Loving. In his police report, Giraldo said Loving would not obey commands, was uncooperative, screaming at officers. However prosecutors said they found no evidence to support Giraldo's statements.</p>

<p>In the video, prosecutors said Loving did obey Giraldo's commands calming down after Giraldo threatened her with arrest. Officer Cassandra Bissett, who initially responded to Loving's call, said Loving was upset, but she was not being disruptive.</p>

<p>""Giraldo knowingly and intentionally caused harm to Ms. Loving,"" the report said.</p>",https://www.local10.com/news/florida/miami-dade/miami-dade-police-officer-in-rough-arrest-to-face-criminal-charges,2019-05-03T17:01:36Z,WPLG,"3401 W Hallandale Beach Blvd, Pembroke Park, FL 33023, USA",FL,33023

PORT RICHEY, Fla (WFLA) - A Port Richey woman arrested on a child abuse charge is now free on bond. When Newschannel Eight approached 38-year old Latoya Dortch about her arrest she had no comment and rushed back into her home.

Investigators say she and the victim got into an argument at a home on Lancelot Road in Port Richey. And that's when they say she kicked him out and locked the door. He broke into the house to retreive his seizure medication which he has to take at certain hours of the day. He then left the home and started walking down the street.

Detectives say Dortch got behind the wheel of her 2018 Nissan Rogue and went after him. Amanda Hunter is a spokeswoman with the sheriff's office.

""The suspect attempted to strike the victim several times, not just once. and again we have a witness who saw this occur multiple times, not just onc,"" said Hunter. ""So we're very fortunate the victim in this case was able to get out without serious injury.""

619,"Stacey Pierre finds family, success at Florida State University, now eyes medical school","Stacey Pierre, who served as student body president at FSU 2018-2019, graduates on Friday, May 3, 2019. (Photo: Jarvis Floyd/Special to the Democrat)

Stacey Pierre’s last week as an undergraduate at Florida State University played out right down to the wire with a 7:30 a.m. Friday final — in comparative vertebrate anatomy.

Her graduation is set for 2 p.m.

On Monday, it was marine biology, and another in immunology. Thursday, it was evolution.

“I will feel relieved after receiving my diploma,” said Pierre, who is majoring in biology, minoring in chemistry and talking the MCAT in August with plans to enroll in medical school.

An outward sense of confidence and composure exudes from Pierre, a first-generation college student from Miramar, whose undergraduate tenure has been marked with success.

Having been accepted to the University of Miami, Florida International University, Spelman College and Baylor, she chose Florida State.

That was largely due to its CARE program, or Center for Academic Retention and Enhancement, which provides preparation, orientation, and academic support programming for students who are among the first in their family to attend college.

Pierre enrolled in summer 2015, taking advantage of the CARE program’s rigorous pre-fall program that allows students to get acclimated to the sprawling campus.

“The CARE center not only does a really good job of attracting you to Florida State University, but they help retain you and help make sure you graduate in four years,” said Pierre, born in Miami to Haitian immigrants, making her a first-generation American.

“I know that although my Mom did a great job raising me and making me into the woman I am today in terms of my core values, but she couldn’t necessarily navigate me through college. That was a new territory for her.”

Pierre hit the ground running her freshman year at FSU and hasn’t looked back. Her resume is filled with academic honors, achievements and community service involvement.

In spring 2017, she was elected vice president of the Student Government Association, and in spring 2018, she was elected student body president, the second black woman to earn the distinction at FSU. The first was Michelle Pletch, who served from 2002-2003.

Pierre said getting involved in student government was a natural progression for her.

“Student government offered a lot of what I wanted during my collegiate career,” she said. “It offered professional development. It offered family. It offered a place to bounce creative ideas off people. Most importantly, it gave me the opportunity to help empower students who were like myself and others who were unlike myself to dare to make a difference.”

As president, Pierre said, she represented “all Florida State students,” but she feels she was able to inspire first-generation students, minority students, women and “people in STEM who didn’t think they would be able to get involved because of their schedules.”

“I’m not a traditional leader,” she said. “I’m a bit quirky. I focused more on relationship building and service. Typically, when people assume roles as president, vice president or treasurer, sometimes they feel they have to act a certain way. I was very good at being myself, so I wasn’t necessarily stoic all the time.”

That made her approachable across campus, she said.

“Stacey Pierre is someone who genuinely cares about the well-being of others around her,” said Brandon Brown, who served as student body vice president with Pierre, and is graduating Saturday. “Stacey’s ability to go above and beyond in her personal goals while also constantly extending a helping hand to others it what makes her a special individual. “

Pierre said being only the second black woman to hold the presidency came with a certain expectation.

“I knew I had a big responsibility, not necessarily to represent my race properly, but to break the glass ceiling of what people thought a student body president had to be or what they were used to seeing,” she said. “I was able to inspire a lot of young women who were like myself, first-generation who are black, and I think they saw a different set of possibilities.”

Pierre is most proud of her administration’s focus on inclusion, bringing in people of diverse voices to address issues that would lead to improving life for students at FSU.

She lists among her accomplishments helping to establish the Mental Health Council and the Diversity and Inclusion Institute partnering with the Student Disability Resource Center and instituting a statewide voter registration drive among the State University System institutions.

Now she will focus on getting into medical school.

“I know I want to be an obstetrician,” she said. “It’s bringing life into the world and I think that’s something I would like to be a part of.”

She plans to apply to the University of Miami, Howard University and Florida State’s College of Medicine, which she admits is her first choice.

“FSU has given me a family and it sharpened my mind and it provided a new path for me in life, a path of opportunities,” she said.

620,"Orlando murder, carjacking suspect arrested in Tallahassee","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - A man wanted in connection with a 2017 homicide and carjacking in Orlando was arrested Wednesday in Tallahassee, police said.

Antwaun Streeter, 33, was on the run for almost 17 months after being named a person of interest in the shooting death of Radeya Haughton.

Investigators said Haughton was shot and killed on Halloween in 2017. The mother of three was a workforce management consultant.

Police believe Streeter is also responsible for shooting another woman while trying to carjack her at the same location on Vista Largo Drive.

An 80-year-old woman was also injured when she was thrown out of her car and was held at gunpoint, police said.

Streeter was arrested on charges of attempted first-degree murder, homicide and armed carjacking. He's being held at the Leon County Jail in Tallahassee.

FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. - A reward is being offered for information about a Jeep that ran over a woman sunbathing last week on a Nassau County beach.

The Law Offices of John M. Phillips announced Wednesday that there is $500 reward if someone is able to identify the vehicle or its driver.

The hit-and-run unfolded about 4:30 p.m. Thursday at Peters Point Park, a beach access off South Fletcher Avenue in an unincorporated part of Amelia Island, the Nassau County Sheriff’s Office said.

The St. Marys woman, who asked not to be named, said she had gotten off work early, so she went out to the beach. She was lying down on a bright-colored beach towel when the Jeep ran over her.

The woman was taken to Baptist Medical Center Nassau, where she was treated for injuries to her legs. Fortunately, she didn’t suffer any broken bones or more serious injuries.

The Jeep, described as a light-colored, late model Wrangler with a black canvas top, was last seen heading toward State Road 200.

On Wednesday, the attorneys representing the woman who was run over released an image showing a Jeep that matches the description of the Jeep that left the scene of the accident.

Attorney John Phillips said if the person made a mistake, just come forward. Otherwise, attorneys said they plan to seek criminal charges.

The attorneys said they are looking for any videos, photos, witness accounts or more details about similar incidents in Nassau County.

The sunbather's attorneys also ask that anyone with details about the incident call 904-444-4444 or email hitandrun@floridajustice.com.

Anyone with information about Thursday's case or the whereabouts of the driver or vehicle involved is also asked to call the Sheriff’s Office at 904-225-5174.

Drug complaints

Shots fired

Prostitution

Car theft

Suspicious persons, at least one with a gun

Cardiac arrest

Police won't say who was found dead inside the home Monday night, but they do suspect foul play in her death. They said it will be up to the medical examiner to determine how she died.

Police no longer name crime victims and even neighbors aren't sure who she was. They said people come and go from that house all the time, so they aren't sure who lives there.

""I wouldn’t call it the best neighborhood in the town,"" Joseph James told News4Jax on Tuesday.

James, who has lived about a block away on Susie Street for more than 20 years, said the crime has gotten out of control.

""I’m not scared to admit to it. I will tell you guys flat out, I know what’s going on around here,"" James said. ""I would love to see it cleaned up a lot nicer, to where we can walk around outside and not have to worry about violence, not have to worry about arguments or something like that.

623,Woman dies after allegedly being attacked in hospital for snoring,"HULL, UNITED KINGDOM - A woman has died after she was attacked in the hospital by another patient who was apparently annoyed with her snoring.

Eileen Bunting, 64, died April 4 after her hospital roommate at the Hull Royal Infirmary threw a cup at her head a few weeks earlier, causing her to suffer facial injuries.

While Bunting's official cause of death was renal failure, her family believes the attack led to a setback from recovery and ultimately caused her passing, according to The Sun.

Bunting's husband said his wife was scheduled to come home the next day and took a sleeping pill the night she was allegedly attacked.

""I know it was to do with snoring,"" said Philip Bunting. ""I know it’s the reason.""

Mark Bunting believes his mother was targeted in a premeditated attack because he claims the door handles to the room were tied together.

Hospital officials say they were staffed properly, but admitted it is impossible to monitor each and every patient around the clock.

Police are now investigating the incident.

(Photo: Michael Braun/news-press.com)

The year of Esther Batista's birth was one of great upheaval around the world.

The world was at war in 1917, with the U.S. jumping into the War to End All Wars before the year was half over. The communist revolution upended Russia. Thousands of African-Americans marched in New York City to decry lynching, and the 18th Amendment — prohibition — was approved by Congress and sent to the states for ratification.

Batista, a native of Santiago in the Dominican Republic, celebrated her 102nd birthday Sunday at St. Andrew Catholic Church in Cape Coral, and said the most important thing she has learned in that time has been her faith.

""The faith that my father taught me,"" said the woman whom an entire church calls 'Abuela,' Spanish for grandmother.

""She was brought up going to church,"" said her son, Ramone Batista, 64. ""She was strong in her faith. That's what we recognize as a sample of her. That's what motivates me in my life. It has been a privilege.""

He said her faith is such that when she prays, she has told others, she often sees angels.

During the Spanish-language Mass at the church Sunday, Pastor Eduardo Coll called her up to receive a special blessing.

Other family members agreed that their abuela's hallmark is a strong Christian belief.

""She prays six or seven times a day,"" said Natalie Koa, 30, a granddaughter. ""She is a very passionate person.""

She remains very active and viable at 102, walking only with a little help from a wooden cane. In fact, she has plans to fly to see relatives in the Dominican Republic later this week, something she does on a regular basis.

""She takes care of herself very well,"" her son said. ""She is phenomenal.""

As of the 2010 U.S. census, of the 618,754 residents in Lee County, there were only 104 — 17 men and 87 women — between 100 and 104. There were only four men and eight women between 105 and 109 and none 110 or older.

A decade earlier, during the 2000 census, the population was 440,888, and those older than 100 were even fewer, 16 men and 68 women, between 100 and 104 and only two men and four women between 105 and 109. However, there were three women 110 or older.

Batista is surrounded by five generations of her family who live in Lee County. She has six children and 26 grandchildren and too many great- and great-great-grandchildren to accurately count, the family jokes.

Esther Batista, who speaks no English, has seen quite a bit of life flow by and has been surprised by some things. But the one thing that modern times have brought her that she enjoys is communication through new technology.

""Being able to Facetime her children in the Dominican Republic,"" granddaughter Esther O'Keefe said.

Along with Esther Batista's passion and faith is a strong will. Koa said her grandmother is always giving her advice about life.

""She says, 'Stay strong',"" Koa said. ""She's always giving her two cents.""

O'Keefe agreed with that and added that her grandmother is often blunt, but in a good way.

""She's the person everyone comes to when they have trouble,"" she said. ""And they walk away with joy. She gets a lot of love at her church.""

632,Woman who lost legs in explosion remembers 'miracle',"FORT LAUDERDALE — After a tourist boat exploded beneath Stefanie Schaffer's seat, mangling her legs, she lay in a hospital bed wondering whether she would ever walk again. But before she surrendered to despair, her doctors unknowingly inspired her.

""Every day when the trauma team would do their rounds, I would hear them outside my door,"" said Schaffer, 22, about her stay at Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale. ""And they'd say, 'The girl in this room is a miracle.' And it just made me feel grateful to be alive for a couple of minutes each day.""

On the back of the Rutland, Vt. college student's left arm is a tattoo.

""Miracle,"" it says.

On June 30, Schaffer, her mother Stacey Bender, 51, stepfather Paul Bender, 56, and sister Brooke Schaffer, 13, were vacationing in Exuma, in the Bahamas. They were in a tour boat on their way to see pigs that swim in the sea.

But, ""five minutes into it, the boat exploded right under my seat,"" Schaffer said. ""Both of my legs were broken beyond repair,"" leading to amputations below her knees.

Her other injuries included compound fractures of her left arm and right wrist; a broken left femur; broken pelvic bones; a broken back and lacerations to her kidneys, liver and spleen. Both her lungs had filled with blood. And she underwent dialysis for three months.

Her family was also hurt in the explosion that day.

Stacy Bender had a broken left leg and right ankle; fractured right wrist, broken ribs, a collapsed lung and internal injuries similar to Stefanie's but not as severe, she said.

Brooke Schaffer was knocked out for a little while and Paul Bender was thrown to the front of the boat; the back of his head was cut open, requiring stitches.

Also aboard the boat was Maleka Grimes Jackson of Tennessee, who was killed in the explosion. Her husband Tyran Jackson survived, and like Schaffer and her family, was flown to South Florida and treated at a Broward Health hospital.

Recently, at the end of the Schaffer-Bender family's weeklong vacation in Key Largo, they stopped at Broward Health in Fort Lauderdale.

Stefanie Schaffer wanted to ""meet the doctors that had really saved my life that I wasn't really conscious to meet. My parents got to know them but I never really got the chance to thank them. I really just wanted to show them what they've given me the opportunity to achieve.

""Because without them, I wouldn't be here,"" she said.

Some of Schaffer's former caregivers, including nurse Rafael Toloza, who has a daughter the same age as Schaffer, and Dr. Christopher Roberts, a neurosurgeon, were brought to tears at the sight of her.

Roberts had performed a fusion procedure on Schaffer's spine, and also took away bone fragments from the lower portion of her spinal cord, which is stabilized with titanium rods and screws.

He greeted her with a hug and a warning not to go snowboarding just yet.

""But we'll get there,"" Roberts told her.

""A lot of times we fix patients and that's it,"" he said. ""Occasionally you'll get a card from another state or another country. But to actually see someone that you touched like this and walking like that, nobody warned me about that. It was a hell of a surprise.""

Her doctors' confidence in Schaffer's recovery, which seemed long and far away for her battered body during those six weeks last summer, helped her to power through another 16 weeks of treatment in two different Boston hospitals.

In all, she has had more than 25 surgeries, and still has 20 doctors who are helping with everything from scar management to physical therapy and pain from the prostheses that she began walking with in November, her parents said.

While in treatment in Boston, Schaffer was visited by survivors of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, in which three people were killed and more than 200 injured. Some of those amputees taught her to look to the future.

""All the time I thought (why me?) in the beginning,"" Schaffer said. ""But one of the Boston bombing victims said when you go through something like this, you can't just keep thinking 'why did this happen?' and 'why me?' because then you're just stuck in it. So I tried to stop asking that question.""

Schaffer doesn't hide her artificial limbs or evidence of her injuries. And for the hospital visit, she chose a short sundress and cute sandals to wear. The toes of her prosthetic feet were painted a light blue — because they were boring before, she said.

""When I first got hurt, I thought I would never be able to show my prosthetics,"" Schaffer said. ""I thought I would never wear shorts again, never wear a bathing suit again, never wear a dress again.""

When she was a patient at Broward Health last summer, ""even if it was 85 degrees out I would cover myself with blankets and I'd go sweat outside and I would refuse to take it off.

""But now, I mean I'm in a dress showing my prosthetics,"" she said. ""I think realizing how much work it takes (to walk with them) makes me more proud to wear them. So people can just understand maybe what I've gone through a little bit. I'm just not embarrassed by it anymore.""

For the pretty, petite brunette, what others may think of her appearance is no longer important.

""Even before I got the prosthetics, I would go around with no legs and covered in scars,"" Schaffer said. ""I knew people were staring but it just didn't really bother me anymore. And that would have just killed me before the accident.""

As Schaffer masters using her new legs, she said she is realizing how hard it is to do.

""I can't feel the ground when I am walking,"" she said. Where her legs meet the devices, there is pain and the skin breaks down. There are fitting issues, and she has phantom limb pain. And her back hurts if she spends too much time in her wheelchair.

""Your whole body has to be strong just to stand up,"" Schaffer said. ""When I first started I couldn't hold myself up, even with parallel bars and a harness. Now I can hold myself up without holding on to anything. But that took a long time.""

Schaffer wants to finish her final year at Castleton University in Vermont, where she is majoring in public health. She wants to earn a master's degree in the same subject, and eventually work with people who have disabilities.

She isn't dating, and said, ""I never really dated before the accident, either. It's a possibility. We'll see.""

Learning to drive with hand controls is also on her to do list.

To those who survive life-altering injuries that require extensive rehabilitation, she said, ""The most important part is to stay motivated. Even when it feels like it's not gonna get any better.

""The medical staff can do their part, but the rest is on you,"" she said. ""And you have to keep going to therapy and you have to keep pushing yourself hard. Because if you don't, you never know where you're gonna get to.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190505/woman-who-lost-legs-in-explosion-remembers-miracle?rssfeed=true,2019-05-05T16:19:58Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
635,Venezuela's counter intelligence agents search for cracks in loyalty to Maduro,"Residents of El Altillo protest as they take part in a rally of pacific protest against the Government of Nicolas Maduro on May 03, 2019 in Caracas, Venezuela. Residents also formed a human chain as they expressed their fight to reach a new…

BOGOTA, Colombia - Venezuela's embattled President Nicolás Maduro's counter intelligence agents are on the hunt.

Counter intelligence agents have been investigating how opposition leader Leopoldo López was able to escape from house arrest Tuesday. They were also searching for government employees who are critical of Maduro.

Sen. Marco Rubio wrote on Twitter that counter intelligence agents were going to carry out arrests. Rubio, Juan Guaidó and López have said there are cracks in the command's allegiance to Maduro.

""The very director of intelligence under Maduro, who used to be Chavez's guy for 12 years is against what’s happening now,"" Guaidó said in Spanish during an interview with ABC News that aired Friday. ""And it’s not like he’s on my side necessarily, but on the side of the constitution.""

Guaidó asked his supporters to meet in front of Venezuelan military barracks on Saturday. He is asking civilians to ask members of the military to defend the 1999 Constitution and join his effort to change the situation in Venezuela.

Counter intelligence agents have been investigating members of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service, or SEBIN, since the secret police director, Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera, stepped down and denounced the ""disproportionate corruption"" that ""many high-level public servants practice as a sport.""

In a letter, Figuera didn't recognize Guaidó as Venezuela's interim president, but he did say it was time for a political change.

""You cannot live in misery in such a rich country,"" Figuera wrote, adding that he was a loyal patriot whose integrity couldn't be bought.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, recognized by many members of the international community as the country's rightful interim ruler, meets workers of Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company PDVSA at Universidad…

While tired of the power outages and water disruptions, many are changing loyalties. On Friday, Guaidó held a rally with Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., employees and leaders in academia launched a strike to protest Maduro's administration.

Amid the paranoia, Lt. Néstor Padilla, the director of operations of the State Police Miranda, also known as Polimiranda. He was dismissed after officers confronted armed members of a ""colectivo,"" a gang of socialist party loyalists who was shooting at civilian protesters in Chacao, NTN24 reported Friday.

Meanwhile in Colombia, 66 former members of the Venezuelan military who deserted and were living in a hotel in Cucuta feared they were a step away from being homeless. And there was also a shootout at the Simon Bolivar bridge connecting Venezuela and Colombia. El Pitazo reported a woman from San Cristóbal was injured while hiking a trail known as ""La Playita.""

637,Search underway for suspect in alleged burglary interrupted by homeowner,"- Deputies with the Seminole County Sheriff's Office, decked-out in body armor and armed with rifles, joined members of the Sheriff's SWAT Team to comb a wooded area late Friday afternoon, for a suspect on the run.

They are looking for a male suspect, between the Lake Forest and Terracina communities. Earlier in the afternoon, deputies took a man and a woman into custody, after investigators said they bailed out a white sedan that got caught up in some bushes at State Road 46 and International Parkway. However, according to deputies, the trouble started almost ten miles away, on Virginia Avenue in Longwood.

“I heard what sounded like a fire cracker going off. Then it sounded like squealing tires going around the corner, taking off or whatever,” said Chris Davis.

Minutes later, he said the home across the street was surrounded by deputies.

“Cops running around, guns drawn!”

Investigators said the homeowner arrived at that house and interrupted a burglary in progress. Deputies said they believe the burglary suspects were armed and there was some kind of confrontation. That ended with the homeowner shooting one shot at the suspects, before they took off in that white sedan.

“I heard the shot…then two cars coming. The black car come behind the [white one] run all the way like a city mile way down,” said neighbor Juan Rivera.

Deputies have not yet released a description of the suspect who remains at large.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/search-underway-for-suspect-in-alleged-burglary-interupted,2019-05-03T23:53:43Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

642,Home healthcare manager accused of sexual assault,"- Seminole County deputies arrested the manager of a home healthcare service, based out of Lake Mary.

Authorities say Gregory Porras, 42, was supposed tobe assisting a blind woman, but instead, he took advantage of her.

""This is someone particularly vunerable. She was home alone at the time, and this suspect was absolutely a predator,"" said Seminole County Sheriff's Office spokesman Bob Kealing. ""He comes to her house, starts having inappropriate context in conversations and it leads to a sexual assault of this victim.""

According to investigators, Porras was both sales manager and caregiver representative at BrightStar Care in Lake Mary.

In the arrest report, deputies say Porras told deputies that he was blackmailed into having sex with the woman -- something investigators didn't believe.

""He gave several stories, but it did not match up with the subsequent investigations and forensic evidence that we were able to gather at the scene.""

BrightStar Care says they fired Porras, and investigators tell us they are looking through two months of records at the company, to see if there are any other victims.

""We're concerned that this brazen level of activity that he showed, could be an indication that he's comfortable doing this and he's done it before,"" Kealing added.

Authorities recommend clients have another person with them when a home healthcare representative comes to visit.

652,TIMELINE: 8 On Your Side's months-long investigation into deadly Lakeland fire,"LAKELAND, Fla. (WFLA) - It's been nearly six months since tragedy struck and a 76-year-old woman died while on the phone with 911 inside her burning Lakeland home.

This week, a report summarizing a post-analysis investigation completed by an outside agency was released to the public. The report done by ESCI appeared to confirm many of the findings 8 On Your Side's Melissa Marino has uncovered since the November fire.

This is a timeline of the tragic fire and Melissa Marino's investigation:

Nov. 23, 2018:

Polk County Fire Rescue is called to a house fire on Rockridge Road in North Lakeland. Loretta Pickard was home when the flames broke out. She died in the fire, just five days before her 77th birthday.

The ESCI investigation found Polk County Fire Rescue had no contact with Pickard's family the night of the fire or in the following days.

Nov. 26, 2018:

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd contacts the county manager about the fire.

According to the report from ESCI, Sheriff Judd reached out to County Manager Jim Freeman three days after the fire to express his concerns about what happened. ESCI says an effort to look at the deadly fire more closely didn't happen until the sheriff voiced his concerns.

Nov. 29, 2018:

Injuries to two Polk County Fire Rescue personnel are reported six days after the fire.

The ESCI report says the injuries were ""reported and documented as having occurred on the scene...both injuries were similar in nature and were documented as first-degree burns to the arm and face due to close proximity to the fire for a prolonged period. The affected personnel were not treated for these reported injuries and only reported them after the fire on November 29, 2018.""

Feb. 7, 2019:

8 On Your Side breaks the story that Loretta Pickard was on the phone with 911 for 20 minutes pleading for her life while her home burned around her.

Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Family wants answers after Polk...

According to the 911 call, Loretta managed to stay on the phone and talk to the 911 dispatcher for 12 minutes after hearing sirens.

""They know I'm in here right?"" she is heard asking on the call.

She took her finals breaths while on the phone as the dispatcher assured her crews were coming in to rescue her.

Feb 8, 2019:

8 On Your Side reveals discrepancies about what happened the night Loretta died.

Deputy County Manager Joe Halman Jr. told Melissa Marino first responders tried to rescue Loretta, but claimed it was too hot. A log we obtained between dispatchers and fire crews tells a different story.

According to the log that was brought to 8 On Your Side's attention by a source in Polk County Fire Rescue, firefighters did not attempt to get into the home or check around it. In fact, they never mentioned the person trapped inside.

Investigation reveals Captain...

The log shows that a dispatcher told the firefighters several times that Loretta was inside, where she was located and that she was still alive. Yet there is no record in the log of any search, rescue attempt, or any mention of the victim from firefighters on scene.

8 On Your Side also learned that Captain James, the person calling the shots at the scene, sents a Snapchat video showing the fire at Loretta's home. Williams was suspended for 24 hours without pay for sending the Snapchat.

Feb. 11, 2019:

Melissa Marino reports dispatch reveals the first crew that responded to the scene of the fire did not attempt to rescue Loretta.

The 911 dispatcher sent at least six transmissions to fire rescue letting them know someone was trapped inside the home. Capt. Williams can be heard acknowledging the information in audio that was obtained by 8 On Your Side.

Capt. Williams then reported over the radio that they were going into ""defensive mode,"" meaning they started to fight the fire from the outside.

8 On Your Side learned that Polk Fire Rescue's policy, and industry standard, is to have two firefighters on the outside before two firefighters go in.

Halman told us that doesn't apply in a situation involving life and death. But according to radio transmissions, Capt. Williams waited instead of sending anyone in.

""When you get here I need your help up at the structure - two in, two out - so we can make entry and see if anybody's inside please,"" he is heard saying to another crew.

A few minutes later on the dispatch call, a chief came on the radio and asked if there was entrapment. Williams replied that it was ""too far gone for us to even attempt to make access to the structure now.""

The captain clarified that he was not asking him to make access but was asking if anyone confirmed there was entrapment. Despite the dispatcher repeatedly notifying the crew that someone was trapped inside, Captain Williams appeared to believe no one was inside.

Polk County commissioners hold a board/staff work session to discuss the findings in ESCI's report.

ESCI gave a presentation to the board outlining what they found while looking into the deadly fire and the recommendations they had moving forward. Officials and investigators then held a news conference to answer questions.

Shortly before that question and answer session began, 8 On Your Side broke the news that Polk County Fire Rescue Chief Tony Stravino was retiring. County officials then confirmed in the news conference that Stravino ""tendered his intent to retire"" and would be leaving within the next 30 days.

DOCUMENTS OBTAINED BY 8 ON YOUR SIDE:

What did the ESCI report find?

The report completed by ESCI confirmed many findings of our previous 8 On Your Side investigations.

In the report, ESCI notes the difficulties crews faced when responding to the fire back in November. They stated the home was in a heavily-wooded area and was surrounded by trees. There was also no marked address on the home or main road.

“The home was not visible” from the road and access to the structure was challenging, the report states. They also noted there are no fire hydrants directly near the home.

Capt. James Williams was the captain of Engine 6 (E6) - the first crew that arrived at the scene that night. According to the report, Capt. Williams “chose to forgo bringing Water Tender 6, stating that he wanted to keep the integrity of his crew together should they need to make a rescue of an occupant.”

ESCI found that Capt. Williams’ crew got to the scene at 7:22 p.m. They also found that the dispatcher announced five times between 7:09 and 7:12 that someone was trapped in the home. However, they did state that, “it may not have been apparent to all responding crews that the caller reporting the entrapment and the victim were on in the same.”

The report states that the dispatcher again mentioned that someone was trapped at 7:25. That information was acknowledged by E6. But according to the report, “it was not until after Engine 6’s arrival and upon questioning by Battalion Chief 1 that dispatch reported that, ‘Command, we are still landline there is somebody inside the structure’ and noted the location as the kitchen.” According to ESCI, that happened at 7:30. That was more than 3 minutes after the last contact with Pickard.

After the fire, ESCI found Polk County Fire Rescue personnel did not receive any follow-up or debriefing of themselves or their crews. There was an effort to look at the incident more closely to figure out what happened, but ESCI says that didn’t happen until the county manager was contacted by a concerned Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd on Nov. 26 – three days after the fire.

ESCI also found that there was no contact with Pickard’s family the night of the fire or in the days following the incident.

In their report, ESCI noted that the initial arriving officer (Capt. Williams) ""was relatively new in his position with limited experience and likely had not been faced with an incident like this before.""

According to ESCI, Capt. Williams reported he and his firefighter tried to do a 360-degree survey. But ESCI says “the officer’s focus on the involved side of the home thwarted his attempt” to make that full walk. That would have allowed him to “ascertain more about the progression of the fire, survivable space entry or egress points and other hazards as is standard protocol,” ESCI wrote.

At 7:25, logs show Capt. Williams radioed in saying he needed the next arriving crew to come straight to the house for a “two-in/two-out” to possibly enter the home. But ESCI says the lack of the initial 360-degree survey by Williams made the reconnaissance ineffective.

ESCI notes that the information that was gathered by the call-taker was very good and that the call-taker kept in contact with the caller up until communication was lost 20 minutes into the fire. That was five minutes after Engine 6 reported they were on scene.

“Based on the timeline, radio communication logs and discussion with responders, there was no indication that the E6 crew was either focused on or in a mode to perform a search and rescue after the initial size-up as described,” ESCI wrote in the report.

ESCI also noted that Captain Williams had “tunnel vision” that resulted in him focusing on only one part of the situation rather than the whole losing situational awareness.

According to ESCI, neither Capt. Williams nor his firefighters brought forcible-entry tools, a Thermal Imaging Camera or a pressurized water extinguisher to the structure to help them get inside or search to execute a victim rescue.

In their report, ESCI states that Pickard's body was found near a door that would have been hidden from the initial-arriving crew when standing on a different side of the home. But if the 360-degree survey could have been completed, ESCI says the door would have likely been seen.

According to ESCI, two injuries to responding firefighters were reported and documented from the fire. The report states they were both similar in nature and were documented as first-degree burns due to their close proximity to the fire for a prolonged period. But ESCI found the affected personnel were not treated for the reported injuries. They also found the injuries weren't reported until Nov. 29 - six days after the fire.

One of the key findings that ESCI noted in their report was that information provided by the caller is ""vitally important"" to units assigned to the incident. ESCI found that, in this incident, the caller provided ""considerable information about the structure, her location within the structure, her condition, and access points to enter the structure."" All of that information was put into the CAD and showed up on mobile computers. But ESCI found the first arriving unit had a computer that was out of service. That means none of the information was available to the crew of E6.

During interviews with fire officers, ESCI said it was clear that ""a majority of these officers are concerned with officer training, mentoring and development of the existing officer cadre as well as the newly-promoted and those aspiring for promotions.""

Another key finding ESCI noted in their report was that ""there was no indication that E6 was in a mode to perform a search and rescue"" after arriving at the scene.

""The officer and firefighter reported that they did not take any tools or other firefighter equipment with them to the scene,"" the report states. ""This may further imply the crew was not in a search and rescue mode.""",http://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/timeline-8-on-your-side-s-months-long-investigation-into-deadly-lakeland-fire/1987196564,2019-05-07T23:49:28Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
654,Kathy Lehner brings innovation to Venice chamber,"In a busy first year as president and CEO of the Venice Area Chamber of Commerce, Kathy Lehner has brought in several programs designed to foster growth among area businesses

VENICE — In her first year as president and CEO of the Venice Area Chamber Commerce, Kathy Lehner has started several initiatives, including a Leadership Venice program, a Women Empowering Women Program and this June will welcome Grow with Google trainer Pamela Starr to the 2019 Marketing Summit.

Lehner started her tenure on March 5, 2018, after the chamber conducted an exhaustive search for someone to succeed the late John Ryan, who died in August 2017 after suffering a heart attack.

She came in with a five-year plan and desire to place her own stamp on the organization where she served as board president in 2005-06.

“I think she’s been able to do a remarkable job continuing John’s legacy and yet opening up new programs for the chamber and new visions and opportunities,” said Virginia Haley, president of Visit Sarasota County.

Lehner said that in many cases the formula was to take existing programs and “enhance them with energy, more substance.

“The economy has a lot to do with it now, too, but we’re giving our folks tools to expand their businesses,” she added.

Some of the most easily noticed changes involved sprucing up the lobby of the 17-year-old chamber building — including glass walls and video monitors that showcase advertising for chamber members — and a mild revamp of the logo to include the chamber tower building.

The logo was redone by marketing and public relations director Erin Lilly — the first of four new employees brought in by Lehner.

“You notice the logo,” Lehner said. “We were our own worst enemy by not letting people know it was us.

“Now we’re a brand,” she added. “Erin has definitely branded us.”

To which, Lilly interjected, “Kathy, she’s being very humble, she talks up the team.

“I like Kathy. I was excited to come to work for her,” she continued, noting that Lehner’s enthusiasm convinced her to take the part-time marketing job. “It sounds like she was on the launch pad.”

In many cases, only a small tweak was in order. For example, early morning meetings member morphed into “Breakfast Brew,” where businesses now have an opportunity to describe what it is they do.

That’s how Mary Elizabeth Petty, with AAA Venice, explained the auto club’s deal with Budweiser to promote cab service for someone who had too much to drink.

Petty brought everyone a Budweiser and explained the service at a recent Breakfast Brew, Lehner said.

“That’s what the business brew is, to stir up and brew up business among each other,” she said.

One of the more obvious partnerships involved teaming up with Visit Sarasota, which now rents an office and has someone staff an enhanced library of tourism information for people who drop by the chamber with queries.

“It’s just such a natural when you look at the kind of traffic that the Venice chamber has,” Haley said. “Everyone always makes a trip to the chamber when they’re visiting.

“It was only natural that we have the county visitor information in the chamber.”

Lehner noted that every year, more than 15,000 people stop in at the chamber asking about local attractions and well over 10,000 people call.

“So the relationship with Visit Sarasota is perfect,” Lehner said, then added that she expects inquiries to grow, once they add a sign on the tower outside that advertises that the visitor’s center is inside.

Selfishly, Haley admitted, it’s nice to now have a south county office to stop in between meetings, instead of working at a local Starbucks.

“We’ve always had a close relationship with the chamber, but I think Kathy’s brought it closer,” Haley said.

Searching for fresh ideas

Lehner also looked to neighboring chambers, as well as organizations as far away as Georgia and the Carolinas, and as far away as Grand Rapids, Michigan, for successful programs she could then emulate in Venice.

So, after she saw the success SCORE Manasota chairman Dennis Zink was having with his CEO Roundtable with the Manatee Chamber of Commerce, she reached out to him to start a similar roundtable in Venice.

The roundtables — which started in October — bring together business owners, some of whom have been in business for 30-plus years, with other non-competing businesses and talk about what does and doesn’t work for them.

One week they discuss team talent — who to hire, who to phase out. Another week they discuss business plans.

“It’s a win-win for us, they don’t charge and it was a nice monthly program where they bring in somebody,” Lehner said.

Currently the chamber has filled three business roundtables, and a waiting list of 28 business owners who want to join in.

Lehner called the Women Empowering Women program — which occurred in October and featured former Sarasota County school board member, state senator and current Sarasota County Commissioner Nancy Detert as the keynote speaker — a dream for her.

Other speakers on a star-studded panel included Debbie LaPinska of PGT Innovations; Lynn Moseley of Jimco Maintenance, Inc.; Brenda Symons, with McDonald’s restaurants; Ashley Brown, from the Women’s Resource Center; Dr. Ki Hassler of Venice Regional Bayfront Health; and Dr. Carol Probsfeld, president of the State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota.

“A lot of times there are these big businesses that women are running and you don’t even know them and you wouldn’t even expect that,” Lehner said.

Lehner points to Mosely, whose Jimco Maintenance services rolling carts, as one example of an atypical career path for a female executive.

“Who thinks of a woman with shopping carts and loading docks?” Lehner said. “It’s not glamorous but you’re successful.”

After Mosely, Lehner said, it just snowballed as to who joined the panel.

Eye on the future

Lehner sees the chamber as a facilitator for area businesses; for example, she hopes to organize a coffee to talk with administrators at local hospitals, home health agencies and schools such as SCF to brainstorm a solution to the shortage of nurses and certified nursing assistants.

“They’re all competing for the same people,” Lehner said. She’d like to see if it’s possible to coordinate so that employees who may be part-time with one employer work additional hours with a second one.

“You use the same people, why can’t we use the same people together,” Lehner said. “That’s what the chamber is supposed to do, be a catalyst to bring those things together.

“Sometimes that’s all it takes is coffee.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190506/kathy-lehner-brings-innovation-to-venice-chamber?rssfeed=true,2019-05-06T07:44:33Z,Sarasota Herald,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236
655,Mental health and children in SWFL: Special report on a growing crisis,"The first in an occasional series of children’s mental health in Southwest Florida. Read our editor’s note for more information and join us as we explore solutions on this important topic.

A LaBelle teenager was doing homework in her room last fall when her mind drifted to worries, dark thoughts and doubts about the future.

The 16-year-old carried a heavy load of honors and college classes and had dreams of becoming a doctor. Good grades seemed like the path to escape the financial struggles of her father, a landscaper, and her mother, a dialysis technician.

Will I have a future? What will I do with it? Is it even worth it? Am I worth it?

She felt so tired. She brought a stashed razor blade to her wrist and cut, something she had done before.

For years, she had hidden her cutting by covering up her scars. But two days after that incident last fall, her parents learned of her injuries. She told them she didn’t want to die.

Within two hours, the family was at Golisano Children’s Hospital of Southwest Florida in south Fort Myers.

It would take days before space in an emergency mental health center, known as a crisis stabilization unit, became available anywhere in South Florida to treat the real reason for the girl’s potentially deadly injuries.

“That was alarming,” said Edith Ortiz, the girl's mother. “You have Naples. You have Fort Myers. You have the west coast. They told me it could be all the way up in Tampa. They did not have one bed in three days.”

The News-Press agreed not to fully identify the girl because she is a minor and her family worries about the negative consequences of sharing her ongoing struggle.

Finally, a spot opened in Bradenton — more than 100 miles away from home.

Problem outpaces population growth

More than a decade ago, Southwest Florida community leaders declared the shortage of mental health services, particularly for children, as one of the region’s most pressing problems.

Since that time, the number of children harming themselves, threatening or attempting suicide, and seeking mental health care has far outpaced population growth.

Mental health evaluations for children under the state’s Baker Act have more than doubled between 2011 and 2017 in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties, state records show. The need has outstripped the rate of population growth: Lee County, for example, grew 17.1 percent during the same period.

About 2,000 children a year in the region are now subject to such examinations, which are designed to stabilize people in immediate danger of harming themselves or others.

Baker Acts referrals for children while in school, a rarity in the early 2000s, now happen hundreds of times a year, even at the elementary school level, according to records from sheriffs' offices. Some schools average several such cases a month.

Graphic by Janie Haseman / The News-Press

And, while local mental health treatment services continue to expand, providers in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties struggle to keep up with demand and sometimes can’t treat children in immediate crisis.

This troubling rise comes amid national jumps in diagnosed anxiety and suicide attempts among children. Experts can’t fully explain why this is happening but say social media, bullying, school pressures, and increased awareness and acceptance of mental illness are likely contributing.

This growing Southwest Florida medical crisis falls to a local health care and social service system stymied by low funding, fragmentation, turf battles and uncertainty about how to deal with the problem.

Two suicides this year of survivors of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland have amplified the need to do more. In March, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for government action on mental health.

Even so, Florida has long ranked at or near the bottom in spending for per-person state-managed mental health programs.

Although the state is far from impoverished, it still acts like it when it comes to mental health, said Kevin Lewis, who led mental health and substance abuse agencies in Fort Myers for decades. Lewis now sits on a regional board overseeing the region’s public mental health treatment services.

“Behavioral health care has been rationed during my entire career and it’s always a horrible situation,” he said. “With many things, we would not tolerate that. Imagine if you had diabetes and there was a six-month wait for insulin?”

It's hard to pinpoint why state funding has historically been scarce, but child welfare experts floated possibilities such as the political influence of older voters who may be removed from the reality of children's needs and a state mental health budget that has grown piecemeal rather than by priorities and needs.

Crisis units often crowded

Southwest Florida’s three closest crisis units for children — SalusCare Fort Myers, the David Lawrence Center in East Naples and Charlotte Behavioral Health in Punta Gorda — collectively have space for little more than 40 children at any time. They commonly face crowding.

SalusCare operated above its funded capacity on average 39 percent of the time last year, or 142 days of the year, according to data obtained from the Central Florida Behavioral Health Network, which oversees publicly funded mental health services in this region.

The East Naples unit also had an average 39 percent rate during that same time.

Charlotte Behavioral Health, which has the region’s largest children’s unit, was above capacity an average 14 percent of the time, or 52 days.

Crisis centers work to avoid turning away children if possible. For instance, the David Lawrence Center sets up extra cots in common areas during busy times, administrators say.

“It happens a lot, a little more during season,” said Tamara Glynn, the center’s acute care director. “We have more need than we have rooms for, unfortunately.”

Even those who receive crisis treatment often wait days or, in some circumstances, weeks — and return to the hospital or Baker Act units because they have trouble accessing follow-up care.

A 2017 state report pointed to several factors contributing to the rise of children in mental health crisis. Those included: “waiting lists for services, limitations on coverage or approval, limited or no funding for prevention and diversion services, and a shortage of psychiatrists and other professionals.”

“The Task Force concluded that Florida is not adequately investing in its children, youth, and families,” said the Florida Department of Children & Families report.

Southwest Florida mental health providers echoed those findings. They described a system focused on crises, such as self-harm requiring hospitalization and suicide threats, and one that is woefully lacking in prevention, such as mental health screenings and quick access to affordable counseling and psychiatric care.

Services have expanded some in recent years. But few providers think it's enough to meet ever increasing demands.

“The situation here is dire,” said Christina Hansen, a Fort Myers psychologist. Edith Ortiz said Hansen is treating her daughter, the LaBelle teenager mentioned at the beginning of this story.

Elite DNA Therapy Services, a large private provider that accepts all insurances, said the number of appointments for Southwest Florida children more than doubled from 25,000 in 2016 to about 60,000 in 2018.

Top diagnoses for those appointments were attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and insomnia.

Elite DNA employs 47 therapists, including 10 licensed clinical social workers, and 18 psychiatric providers who see children. Of those 18, four are psychiatrists. The rest are nurse practitioners and physicians assistants paired with a psychiatrist because of the ""extreme"" shortage of child psychiatrists, company leaders said.

“We could bring in five psychiatrists and 10 social workers and there would still be an issue because there’s been so much need for so long,” said Elizabeth Dosoretz, Elite DNA founder.

Too ashamed to tell parents

The morning after cutting her wrist, the teenager chose a long-sleeved shirt for church.

It was the third time she had attempted suicide in the past year or so, but she was too ashamed to tell her parents.

Twice she had cut her wrists; another time she swallowed some random pills she had found in the house. None of the earlier attempts ever required hospitalization or alerted her family to her problem.

Depression and anxiety were just problems they never talked about, she said, particularly because the subject of mental health remains taboo among many Mexican-Americans.

Over dinner that Sunday, the high school junior considered how her death would affect her family, her two little brothers especially.

Maybe I’m still here for a reason.

At some point before dawn, she pulled a pillow and blanket into the laundry room leading to the back door, knowing she'd catch her mother as she left early for work. She planned to tell her everything.

""Are you OK?,"" her mother asked when she saw her daughter on the floor.

Her daughter still couldn't open up. ""I have a stomach ache.""

But a few hours later, her little brother found a bloody towel and showed their father. He called Edith Ortiz at work and passed her daughter the phone. She said she needed help.

“I do it so that I don’t feel anything,"" the girl later explained. ""I overthink things too much, and all these emotions are in your head. I just don’t want to do anything. I don’t want to feel anything. I just want to be numb.”

Ortiz rushed home from her job in Clewiston and, with her husband and their 6-year-old son, drove more than an hour from LaBelle to Golisano.

Doctors checked the girl’s wounds and ran a battery of tests to make sure she hadn’t taken drugs. They told her she would need a psychiatric examination at a state-approved facility that received individuals under the Baker Act.

Hospital staff could not find a space for her in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties. They called centers as far as Orlando and Miami, the family said.

Nothing was available. She would have to wait. No one knew how long.

Thousands go to hospital ERs

Hospitals increasingly find themselves on the front lines of the region’s mental health crisis.

Between 2005 and 2015, more than 31,000 children showed up in ERs in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties with diagnosable mental illnesses — from substance addiction to severe anxiety and depression, according to non-identifiable patient discharge records obtained by The News-Press.

The number who reported suicidal thoughts or had committed serious self-harm, such as cutting, went up at least 50 percent between 2005 and 2015, those records show. That now translates into roughly 300 children a year.

Hospital staff sometimes struggle to find crisis centers with room to take them. Records from Lee Health, the largest hospital operator between Tampa and Miami, show that an average of 1-in-10 pediatric ER patients subject to Baker Act evaluations had to use crisis centers outside their home counties over the past decade.

As many as a quarter of children have had to use out-of-town crisis units during certain stretches of busy months, medical staff say.

The vast majority of these Lee Health patients are in low-income families who are uninsured or are covered by Medicaid.

“They don’t always have transportation readily available,” said Armando Llechu, chief administrative officer of Golisano Children’s Hospital, which Lee Health operates. “And now, for at least the next 72 hours for the Baker Act period, three days, they’re basically going to have to travel to Tampa and back to visit their child, participate in group therapy sessions, and speak to the physicians.”

Waiting and watched

For Edith Ortiz’s daughter, the time at Golisano was stretches of boredom punctuated by episodes of “Law & Order.” She wasn’t allowed on computers or phones and couldn't do school work. She worried her grades would drop and ruin her chances at a good college.

Hospital volunteers known as “sitters” kept constant watch. One pulled her chair over to an open bathroom to watch her shower. A hospital social worker kept her apprised of crowding at crisis units.

“She just kept telling me that she was calling places and that there were no open spots and that, supposedly, there were going to be open spots the next day,” the girl said. “She kept trying and trying and trying.”

Another surprise: The social worker warned that if the girl were transported to SalusCare, the Lee County Sheriff’s Office would, according to its own policy, handcuff her for the trip. This didn't bother the girl as much as it did her mother, who thought the system was punishing her daughter for seeking help.

""I didn't really do it to cover up the scars, but I did it to give people something to stare at."" Amanda Inscore/The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA

Lee Health has no psychiatrists on staff or on call for patients showing up in the ER after suicide attempts, administrators said. Nor does it plan to add such staffing, because they are already available at crisis stabilization units, Llechu said.

The delayed mental health treatment was also unexpected to Ortiz, who is studying to be a nurse.

“If you have somebody coming into your ER with a heart attack, are you going to wait and see and study everything why you had the heart attack? No, you’re going to treat the heart attack right there and then.”

The family’s wait ended after two days. Sometime around 1 a.m., the girl was rousted. A spot had opened in Bradenton. She would have to leave immediately.

The girl was strapped in a gurney and placed in an ambulance around 3 a.m. It would be a two-hour trip.

Not enough screening or doctors

Treatment providers say the region’s mental health system is largely focused on crises, such as self-harm requiring hospitalization and threats of suicide.

But they say it’s failing when it comes to preventive mental health screenings and easy access to affordable counseling and psychiatric care. And demand is quickly rising.

The behavioral health team with Lee Physician Group, an outpatient medical group Lee Health operates, saw 1,088 patient visits in 2017. Lee Health projects that number will be nearly 12,000 this year.

Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties each have roughly one mental health provider of any type per 1,000 residents, compared with the Florida average of one per 670 people, according to a University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute analysis of the nation’s health care this year.

The top-performing U.S. counties, particularly some affluent and highly populated areas of the nation, have an average ratio of 310-to-1.

For more than a decade, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry has sounded alarms about the shortage of child psychiatrists.

There are about 8,300 practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists in the United States to serve more than 15 million children in need, it notes. The academy points to factors swaying medical students from the path, including educational debt, long training requirements, and insurance reimbursement hassles.

For providers overall, pay can be a problem. It's tough for local mental health agencies dependent on public funding to be competitive.

“Sometimes we are not as competitive as we would like to be, so that opens up the window a bit for some staff to look elsewhere,” said Stacey Cook, president and CEO of SalusCare. “We serve a largely indigent and underinsured population, so it can make it difficult to stay competitive.”

Funding initiatives

The news is not all bad.

Millions in state funding for mental health services is filtering into Southwest Florida in the wake of the 2018 killings in Parkland. As part of that, the state created mobile crisis units designed to respond to young people in mental health crises within 60 minutes.

Lee and Collier wine festivals have made raising money for children's mental health services a priority.

Collier County agencies, for several years, have collaborated to reach at-risk children before they are in crises through the Beautiful Minds initiative, organized and supported by the Naples Children & Education Foundation, the philanthropy arm of the Naples Winter Wine Festival. The foundation counts more than 55,200 youth who received services and treatment since the initiative began.

Another fundraising effort, the Kids’ Minds Matter campaign in Lee County, aims to raise $10 million over the next three years to finance more programming and mental health providers.

Lee Health also recently announced a new pediatric mental health screening program for a select group of children on its “Vivida” Medicaid managed-care program, though they are likely to number in the hundreds.

A broader program it has participated in for years provides basic mental health training to pediatricians to help them spot problems early.

But all of this is unlikely to be enough, said Paul Simeone, Lee Health’s recently hired medical director for behavioral and mental health.

“It’s fairly shocking, really, that people get as little coverage as they do down here,” said Simeone, who last worked for a Boston health system. “One of the things I’m concerned about, as we screen more people is: Are we going to have enough resources for them?”

Children can get better when they can get the care they need. The News-Press spoke to several teenagers who healed with medication, therapy or both.

Whether they get that care often depends on their parents. Getting the correct diagnosis and finding the right therapist can be trial-and-error and take months, even years. The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry notes average delays of up to 10 years between the start of symptoms and treatment.

Another factor: the child's willingness to engage.

Many children’s mental health providers and community leaders have tried to respond to the rising number of children in need.

SalusCare expanded its children's crisis unit from 12 to 16 beds in 2016. The David Lawrence Center in East Naples doubled its capacity from four to eight about the same time and is now planning possibly three to five more beds. Charlotte Behavioral Health Care doubled the number of children's beds to 20 in 2017.

Finally, an outpatient appointment

Edith Ortiz scanned the waiting room of the LaBelle mental health clinic.

It was November, nearly two months after her daughter was released from the Bradenton crisis unit. The dim room contained mostly adults. A middle-aged woman, appearing to be the throes of a drug withdrawal, trembled and scratched.

Where in the world did I bring my daughter?

Still, she was grateful. This was the first outpatient mental health appointment she could get for her daughter.

Edith Ortiz's daughter got a sunflower tattoo over the scars on her wrist. ""I did it to give people something to stare at because I thought, 'Well, if you’re going to stare, why not stare at something nice.' "" Amanda Inscore/The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA

The Bradenton crisis unit had given her daughter lithium, a powerful antidepressant commonly prescribed to people at risk for suicide. The drug mostly just made her daughter sleepy.

This clinic offered a different approach and prescribed her a month’s supply of low-dose Prozac. The provider urged her to participate in group therapy.

Clinic staff promised to call soon to schedule another appointment. They never did. No one called back despite Ortiz’s repeated attempts. Later, she would learn the clinic had closed.

The family had found a good psychologist in Fort Myers and were happy to drive up to two hours each week for the appointments. The therapy was helping her cope with the anxiety and depressive disorder, her diagnoses. But psychologists, who don't have medical degrees, can't prescribe medication.

On New Year's Day, her daughter got a sunflower tattoo over the scars on her wrist.

""I did it to give people something to stare at because I thought, 'Well, if you’re going to stare, why not stare at something nice.' ""

In February, the family managed to secure a psychiatric appointment in Fort Myers. She was seen quickly and received new prescriptions they hope will work. After months of struggle, it felt like a new start.

656,Siri helps Mom move out of isolation and into the modern world | Gary Yordon,"Anne Yordon with grandson Jackson Yordon. (Photo: Gary Yordon)

I imagined this must be similar to the lifeline a cave diver would use — a cord through the labyrinth used to find their way safely back to the surface. I knew holding onto this line was my only hope. It was the phone wire from my parents' landline to the plug in the wall — a wire that had not been touched since Eisenhower signed the Korean peace treaty.

I packed some trail mix and bottled water and started the journey. I followed the landline along the carpet in front of the fireplace and around the second shelf of the first bookcase, then along the base of the crown molding, before pivoting back to the same bookcase.

There seemed to be a path right behind Julia Child’s first cookbook, under a Hebrew songbook and then back down the second bookcase. Along the way I found Alexander Graham Bell’s driver's license.

Finally, in a dark musty corner, neatly tucked between a binder with my grandmother’s kugel recipe and my brother Steve’s Bar Mitzvah picture, there it was — the phone plug. Little did I know, my journey had just begun.

After my dad, Lenny Yordon, passed away last fall, my 93-year-old mom Anne had found herself in a communications desert. Her only two links to the outside world were her ancient landline and the equivalent of an iPhone 1, which she got when Siri was a third-grader.

I was also not aware that my dad had developed encryption long before it became a recognized worldwide security tool. Any successful attempt to interpret his handwritten pad of passwords and sticky notes would make the CIA Hall of Fame. But somehow, he made their entire network operate seamlessly.

Dad had his own divine brilliance. He controlled their only computer and he was the gatekeeper of their joint email account. He had wired their home printer and Wi-Fi apparently using a map of the human nervous system. When I surveyed the web of wires, I thought to myself, with a little marinara this could work as a main dish. Dad had enough sticky notes to wallpaper the Louvre.

After multiple attempts to figure out his hieroglyphics, Dad’s iPad is now locked until 2053. I did manage to crack the code for his computer to find the 8,000 unread emails that have accumulated since he passed.

After we fought our way through the maze of passwords, wires and sticky notes, Berneice and I decided the best thing for Mom was to just start over.

New iPhone, iPad and new wireless printer. A brand spanking new Gmail account and her very own Facebook page. No more eight-second videos of her foot on Facebook. No more 10 minute shots of her ceiling fan on FaceTime calls. Look out world, here comes Anne Yordon.

Mom’s grit to embrace change since Dad’s passing has been inspiring, and she found her communication isolation frustratingly unacceptable. And while she didn’t know the difference between a PIN code and a password, she accepted the challenge with grace.

One major stumbling block was her grasp of the internet as a worldwide phenomenon. While we were setting up her internet banking she got a little frustrated with the bank rep in Pakistan and asked him if he could just stop talking and give her the name of the woman she talked with a few months ago at her branch around the corner from their home in Daytona Beach. Unproductive but adorable.

When we were setting up Siri on her iPad and the screen directions said, “Repeat this phrase: 'Hey, Siri, what’s the weather forecast?'” Mom would say, “Repeat this phrase, 'Hey, Siri, what’s the weather forecast.'” Again, totally cute.

For those of us who have adapted to rapidly changing advances in the way we communicate, simple changes are just that, simple. But when you are 93 and you lose your 66-year partner, the person who made sure you were always in touch with the social universe, adapting to a new electronic language is a big hill to climb.

But three simple words let me know that Mom was going to be OK. It was when I received her first unsolicited text message to me. It said simply, “I got this.”

On that point, Siri and I agree. We know you do, Mom.

657,It's better to be interested than interesting | Quint Studer,"Am I interested or interesting? This is a question that every leader (in fact, every person) needs to ask themselves. When we come across as interested in others rather than trying to be interesting to them, there’s a better chance they’ll like and trust us. This is a huge part of engaging people and creating strong relationships both in and out of the workplace.

A few weeks back, I received an email from a woman named Becca Smith who shared that she recalls a talk I gave on this topic. Becca and I worked together years ago, and she and her family now live in Texas. She told me she found this talk helpful at the time and wondered if I had anything written on the subject I could send her. I looked and could not find anything, so I decided to write a column about interested vs. interesting.

Being interested in others may sound simple, but it’s a lot harder than one might think. As I sat down to think about it, I realized there are actually three parts to this equation. One is overcoming the natural urge to try to be interesting. (That’s this week’s column.) The second part — which will come next week — is developing the skill of being interested, which centers on asking good questions. Finally, two weeks from now, we will zero-in on listening, which is a vital part of showing people you’re interested.

EAP services: Why EAP services are important — and how to help employees use them

Being interested gets people to open up, which paves the way to an authentic connection. It gets us beyond arm’s length and creates the kind of relationship that makes people want to sign on as clients or buy from us or partner with us. It helps us build the kind of strong relationships with employees that inspire them to do their best work. It helps us create loyal customers. It’s an awesome business skill.

Yes, we also need to have the right leadership and technical skills — and our company’s products and service have to have the right price and a good level of quality — but all of these are just the price of entry. In the end, we do business with people we like. Ask yourself whom you enjoy being around the most: the person who is interested or interesting?

I struggle with being interested myself. Many do. It’s natural to want to hear our own voices and tell our own stories. A lot of this has to do with the signals we get all our lives. We are taught that to be leaders we need to come across as experts, always sharing advice and giving feedback. Being interested in and listening to others isn’t always emphasized. But it’s what gets results.

For years I would spend three or four nights a week in a hotel. I would flip on the TV and channel surf. Many times, I was just looking for some show to watch without requiring deep thinking, which gives me a headache. Anyway, years ago I came across a show called ""Blind Date."" It would match up two adults who would go out on an evening date and follow that up with a full-day date. At the end of the show, each person would be interviewed about their experience. Then the question would be asked, “Do you want to go out with this person again?”

Sometimes both would say yes or both would say no. Other times one would say yes, and one would say no. The person who said yes was always surprised when the other said no, for their perception was that the date had gone well. I noticed those who spent the most time being interested were much more likely to get a yes versus those who spent more time trying to be interesting. The person trying to be interesting spent most of the time talking about themselves instead of listening and asking questions. Those who were interested often used appreciative inquiry, meaning they were able to ask questions in a positive, insightful, interesting manner.

I know firsthand it can be tough to resist the urge to be interesting. In particular, being a good listener is hard for me. Every report card I ever received had checkmarks by “Needs improvement in listening.” This can come across as lack of respect. It is a characteristic I must work on constantly.

The first step is to get really intentional about being interested. Just being aware of our natural tendency to try to be interesting is a huge part of the battle. Then we can take steps to change this. In my case, I have found there are some simple tools and techniques that help me to do a better job of being interested. Here are some that work for me:

• At the top of an agenda for a meeting, I write myself a note to be quiet. (OK, it actually reads, “Quint, keep your big mouth shut.”)

• After a conversation, I ask myself, Do I know more about the other person or do they know more about me? If I know more about the other person, the conversation was a success.

• I write down the names of the attendees of meetings (including my own). When someone speaks, I put a checkmark by their name. This helps me hold up the mirror so I will listen more and talk less.

• Wait. Let others weigh in first. Many times, I find the point I wanted to make or information I wanted to share is said by someone else.

• Ask questions before sharing information about self or company. When you’re in a meeting, it’s a natural urge to talk about your company’s product or value. Plus, we’re often trained to do this. Before speaking, pause to shift your focus to the other person. If waiting on a customer, take time to gauge what their needs are. Why are they in the store? Even if you feel it is obvious, ask anyway. Sure, a couple coming into a restaurant wants to eat. However, maybe it’s because it is the place they had their first date, or they are craving something on the menu, or someone recommended it.

• Do the same in the workplace. This past week, it was time for me to meet with Crissy Nettles, the newly hired manager of the bookstore that will be opening in Southtowne. My role was to share with her the history of the Studer Family of Companies. Becca’s email had reminded me to be interested more than interesting, so I started by asking Crissy about herself. I learned about her parents, where she grew up, received her undergraduate degree, her overseas experience in her course of study, her master’s degree, how she met her husband, her children, her experience of owning a bookstore in Monroeville, Alabama, her family’s move here, where she worked before accepting the bookstore job, and her first impressions of whether we are walking the talk.

I found our conversation interesting and I learned things that I feel will help me know more about bookstores and how I can be helpful. Without “being interested” being top of mind, I wouldn’t have handled our time together this way. That would have been a shame, because I feel it got our relationship off on the right foot. The saying “Nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care” comes to mind here. (We will talk more about the power of asking great questions next week.)

• Look for ways to build tactics showing you are interested into the workplace. In past columns, I’ve described such techniques as rounding on employees and customers, utilizing peers in the hiring of new staff, sending thank-you notes, and calling customers to see how they are doing. Each one shows interest. (Again, we will cover these in more detail in next week’s column.)

• Work hard to hone your listening skills. Along with asking questions, great listening is a cornerstone of being interested. (We’ll cover the fundamentals of great listening in two weeks.)

• Working to become more interested can lead to great enlightenment about others and one’s self. Also, it completely changes the way they see you. And it takes a lot of pressure off—once you realize that you don’t have to keep trying to prove you’re the smartest person in the room, it’s amazing how much you’ll enjoy connecting with the people around you, and how much you’ll learn in the process.

660,Florida SouthWestern State College graduates have head start with career paths,"As the “pomp and circumstance” of graduation began, with the song being played by a six-piece jazz band, hundreds of students filed in to celebrate, set to begin the next phase of their lives.

Except many of them already had started.

Florida SouthWestern State College celebrated the graduations of 3,278 students with morning and afternoon ceremonies Friday at Suncoast Credit Union Arena. About 1,000 students participated in the ceremonies.

With packed crowds of about 2,500 family members, friends and professors at each ceremony, they walked to their seats on the arena floor to great applause and fanfare.

Graduates Samantha Fitzpatrick, 20, and Lindsay Guzman, 22, each were tapped to deliver commencement addresses.

Wearing flowing black robes and the traditional black caps, many grads chose to decorate the top of those caps with playful messages. One had a Wonder Woman logo on it and “2019.” One said: “I worked hard so my dog can have a better life.” Another said, “Be Fearless.” It had a cross at the bottom and was adorned with a sunflower and a pink ribbon.

Guzman wrote “Don’t make me use my teacher’s voice” on hers. She already has started the next chapter of her life. She did so in the fall as a third-grade teacher at Manatee Elementary School in Fort Myers.

“What we learned in school, with classroom experience, we could apply to the real world,” Guzman said of her time at FSW, from which she graduated in December with a degree in elementary education. “I feel that put me ahead of some other schools. You could see what works and what doesn’t.”

Because of her classroom experience, Guzman is no stranger to speaking to groups. But usually, she’s talking to 17 students, not a couple of thousand people.

“I’m just going into it like it’s one, giant classroom,” she said, prior to her speech.

Like Guzman, the graduating Nicole Smith also has real-world experience.

Smith, 38 and originally from Washington, D.C., moved to Lee County in 1998, attending Estero High for the last two months of high school. She graduated from FSW for the first time in 2008, when it was known as Edison College and held the ceremony at Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall. She graduated then with a degree in respiratory care. She left Friday with a degree in cardiopulmonary science.

Smith has worked at Health Park Medical Center. She also works for FSW as a clinical associate and even helped one of her professors by writing a chapter for a medical textbook, published in March.

“I love it,” Smith said of FSW. “It’s come along way from its days as Edison College. Sports, student activities, the arena.”

Smith said she too has come a long way. She credited faculty members Sindee Karpel and Jean Newberry with mentoring and motivating her.

“When I first started, I was a little bit of a problem child,” said Smith, who hopes to get a master’s degree in health care administration from LSU. “They helped me realize that I’m worth it, and I can do anything.”

Like Smith, Ricardo Ortega, 20, graduated with cum laude honors, meaning a grade point average above 3.5.

Ortega also has a real-world job, working for Suncoast Credit Union as a loan officer. Born in Mexico City, the temporary U.S. resident became the first member of his family to earn a college degree. His parents, Cornelio and Araceli Ortega, just didn’t have the means, he said. He hopes to inspire his sister, Lucia, 7, to seek higher education as well.

“I was able to escape that path thanks to the opportunities that this country gives,” Ortega said. His father is an electrician. “This country is full of opportunities for us to be able to work and for me to continue my education.”

Fitzpatrick, who moved to Fort Myers two years ago with her mom after graduating from Trumball High School in Connecticut, graduated with an accounting degree.

“I’ll be transferring to FGCU in the fall to get my master’s in business and human resources,” she said. “I changed my major a bit. I want to interact more with people.

“While I was at FSW, I was part of a peer mentor team. That helps students with their introduction to college life. It’s called the cornerstone experience class. I realized I loved helping people. I do have a speech prepared. I’m going to be talking about transformation and how FSW has helped my transformation from someone who was quite shy to someone who wants to be a part of a team.”

As Guzman took the podium for her speech, she read from a prepared script on her phone. She weaved into it the theme of technology. But she imparted a message that in the end, you can only rely on technology so much.

“As I began to write this very speech, I did what most college students do,” she told the audience. “go to Google….

“What I soon realized was, you can Google for an answer. You can Google for a career. You can even Google for a strange rash that suddenly appears and then you soon find out you’re going to die tomorrow. Or not.

“Yet what you can’t Google is what is found in your heart. The passion that lifts you and gets you up every morning.”

""Each bounce house is a little different but there is printed rules on each one for you to look at,"" Larson told KXLY. ""There's different things you want to do, make sure you're using stakes or weights to weigh it down and straps to tie it down.""

It is unclear what caused the bounce house to go airborne.

For one man in Virginia, the debate landed him behind bars after authorities said he shot three people.

WSET-TV reported police in Bedford County Virginia arrested 56-year-old Mark Edwin Turner on charges of felony malicious wounding, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony and possession of a firearm by a felon.

The station reported that Turner, his girlfriend, his girlfriend’s son and her son’s girlfriend were having dinner on April 20 when the debate over whether Ford or Chevy were the better manufacturer.

""The allegation is that there was alcohol involved and a dispute began against Logan Bailey, the son of the girlfriend, and Mr. Turner about what type of vehicle is best. Chevy vs. Ford,"" Bedford County Commonwealth's Attorney Wes Nance said.

Nance said the group eventually moved into the front yard where the argument continued.

At some point, Turner allegedly pulled out a knife and his girlfriend tried to break the two up when the confrontation began to escalate.

""The evidence would be that Mr. Turner got so upset that he brandished a knife, that Ms. Bailey got between Mr. Turner, and Ms. Bailey and was actually struck with the knife causing about a 6-inch injury,"" Nance said.

The incident then continued after Nance said Turner went back inside the home, only to return with a gun. Turner allegedly fired the weapon, striking his girlfriend five times in the leg, and shooting her son once in the arm. The son’s girlfriend was also injured when the bullets ricocheted.

665,Defense claims Kimberly Kessler is unfit to stand trial,"YULEE, Fla. - The defense for Kimberly Kessler, the woman charged with murdering her former co-worker Joleen Cummings, said a psychiatrist has found their client incompetent for trial.

But a prosecutor disputed that characterization of Kessler’s mental health, saying the state disagrees with the defense expert’s findings and plans to file a motion seeking a second opinion.

Kessler, 50, was not in court Thursday morning. Her next hearing date was pushed back to June 27.

Investigators suspect Kessler, who worked with Cummings at Tangles hair salon in Yulee, was the last person to see Cummings alive. The Nassau County mother of three was reported missing last May.

Kessler is charged with first-degree murder in Cummings’ death. A year later, the 37-year-old’s body has not been found, despite an extensive search at a Georgia landfill that turned up items of interest.

Following Cummings’ disappearance, her SUV was found parked outside a Home Depot. Kessler was arrested May 16 after investigators said they found footage showing her getting out of the vehicle.

Since then, the state has released reams of evidence in the case through the discovery process that suggest a struggle occurred at the salon and that steps were taken to dispose of that evidence.

666,'A force' for goodness: Longtime library FriendShop manager Helga Jackson remembered by patrons,"Helga Jackson. (Photo: Peggy Adair/Special to the Democrat)

Those who knew Helga Jackson echo each other: her wide, bright smile, warm hugs and energetic personality were magnetic.

For the past 14 years, Jackson was the familiar, friendly face at the FriendShop, the bookstore she ran at the LeRoy Collins Public Library off Park Avenue.

Jackson died April 24 after a quiet battle with cancer. She was 63.

""It won't be the same going in there without her,"" said Daniel Parker, who frequented the library and FriendShop with his family.

When his daughter Arwen, 11, found a book she liked, Jackson would often whisper to her, ""I'll buy it.""

""She was just a pleasant, authentic, loving person,"" Parker said.

Jackson was born in Kronach, Germany. She met her husband Morris Jackson when he was a U.S. soldier stationed in the country. The couple married in 1981 in Bad Tolz, Germany when she was 25 and moved to Tallahassee where Morris has family, friends said.

Jackson knew her customers well, with a keen knowledge on their tastes. When a 45-rpm record of ""Purple Rain"" was donated to the shop, she knew just the right person for it.

She'd decorate the store with colorful posters and artwork, was meticulous about organization and was a driving force behind the Friends of the Library fundraiser.

""Helga was someone who only had friends. She liked people very much. I think a lot of her customers came back partly because of the merchandise — but a lot because of who she was. She was very friendly, very caring and she had a great sense of humor,"" said Library Director Debra Sears. She's known Jackson for 13 years. ""She genuinely cared that people could find things that they were interested in and the shop was welcoming.""

Coworkers and friends say the woman was a private person who didn't speak much of herself. She instead exuded a warm curiosity.

She was ""always happy and always asked you about yourself,"" said Darby Tish, Friends of the Library president. ""She was just a gem... She gave the best hugs. She would almost crack your back when she gave you a hug. She was a force.""

In her spare time, the vibrant woman loved gardening, caring for stray cats and taking long strolls.

""I would have loved to say goodbye,"" Parker said. ""The best goodbye is just to remember her because I didn't get to say goodbye.""

668,Brevard moms band together over postpartum depression,"Kristy Losapio’s car was parked in her closed garage. She sat in the driver’s seat and prepared to turn the car on with hopes of slipping away.

Losapio’s then husband walked into the garage and found her sitting in a daze.

“He said, ‘what are you doing,’ and I said ‘I don’t know. I just want to turn the car on,’” Losapio recalled of the incident that took place 14 years ago.

At the time, she had a toddler and a newborn waiting for her inside the house.

“I thought, if I just turn the car on, my husband can find someone who can take better care of these kids,” Losapio said. “At the time it felt like this was a good solution for me. It made sense. I can’t take care of (my children) so he needs to find someone better, which is obviously completely crazy now. I didn’t have confidence in my ability to take care of my newborn.”

Unbeknownst to Losapio, she was experiencing postpartum depression.

About one in 9 women experience symptoms of postpartum depression, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts estimate even more women are affected because many do not report symptoms or do not understand what they are feeling.

Losapio, a nurse practitioner, said even being in the medical profession, she still didn’t realize what was happening to her while she was in the thick of it. She also added, postpartum depression isn’t exactly a topic most people are comfortable sharing.

“I was embarrassed to talk about it,” Losapio said. “I think there is a lot of shame as a mom that you would have those feelings.”

Losapio wants to change that. She teamed up with other moms and health professionals to bring awareness and help get treatment for a condition often unrecognized or ignored because of shame.

Postpartum Support Network is a newly-formed non-profit group supporting moms and families in Brevard who are experiencing postpartum depression. The group officially launched this week in honor of Maternal Mental Health Week.

Tina Lange is the group’s founder and president. She experienced postpartum depression 15 years ago when her oldest child was born.

“It destroyed my marriage and really impacted my life in every way,” she said. “Since I went through that, I have always felt passionately about helping woman going through it. There’s a lot of guilt and shame because woman don’t want to admit they are having these thoughts.”

She has three main goals for the organization, the first is educating the public and getting people talking, making them more aware of postpartum depression and making it more comfortable for new moms and families to ask for help.

Secondly, Lange is in the process of creating a network of mental health experts. Lastly, she would like to create a model that other cities, counties, groups, whomever, can replicate.

“If a mom calls me today and says she needs help, we would be a safe place for her and we would be able to connect her with people who can help her,” Lange said.

Most of the mental health experts the group currently works with do not accept insurance. However, they have agreed to provide a sliding scale payment system for those who need financial help. Lange’s group is trying to raise money to provide sponsorship to moms who cannot afford treatment.

“We do not want anybody to not get treated because they can’t afford it,” Lange said.

The group also is working to get postpartum screening in all OBGYN offices.

Dr. Stephen Tobia, an OBGYN with Health First Medical Group, said patients within his practice are universally screened for postpartum depression.

“They are followed closely after delivery for developing symptoms,” Tobia said. “Those with significant risk factors, such as a history of postpartum depression in a previous pregnancy, are followed closer.”

He said it can be difficult for patients to understand the difference between typical baby blues and postpartum depression, and that is why a medical doctor should conduct screenings. Those patients who do have postpartum depression have options such as pharmacologic therapy, lifestyle changes and counseling.

“It is important for women to know how common postpartum depression is and that they are not alone,” Tobia said. “It is also imperative to identify and help alleviate additional factors such as combined stressful events, fatigue, or poor social and financial support.”

Lydia Baker is a childbirth educator with Health First Medical Group and Hibiscus Women’s Center as well as an independent birth and postpartum doula. She said families are often lost in those first few “survivor mode” weeks and they do not know who to turn to for help. The Postpartum Support Network, she said, will bridge the gap between patients and providers.

“It’s important for moms and partners to know where to go for help if needed,” Baker said. “Partners also need to know that providing non-judgmental support and encouragement are important to her postpartum recovery.”

Baker said as high as 80 percent of new moms experience some negative feelings or mood swings during the three weeks after delivery. She makes it a point in her childbirth classes to talk to expectant parents about the warning signs and differences between postpartum depression and “baby blues.”

Baby blues is exactly what Kristin Wallace experienced after the birth of her first child. After delivering her second child, Wallace said the feelings were elevated to a whole new level.

“My head was playing these what-if scenerios,” Wallace said. “I started to wonder if I was a safe person and if I should even be left alone with my baby. It was painful to experience my imagination. At the time I was pretty suicidal.”

Wallace reached out to her husband and contacted her doctor. She was put on medicine, which along with a strong support system helped.

“My husband was saying , ‘”I love you and I need you and the kids need you,” she recalled. “For me it just came to having to decide to walk through the motions of life or weather to decide I wasn’t cut out of this. I believe it was the grace of God who kept me through.”

Wallace went on to have four more children. She said there were some low points after those births, but nothing like what she previously experienced. She was much more prepared and knew how to handle any postpartum depression feelings.

“If you feel like you don’t have a support group, there are resources, find them,” Wallace said. “Talk about these experience. Reach out and get yourself a good mental health physician.”

HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - A 24-year-old Hillsborough County woman was arrested this week for aggravated child abuse that deputies say likely will impact the victim forever.

The incident happened on April 10 and involved a 2-month-old child. Deputies say Brienna Craig took the child to the hospital after he was found unresponsive.

Detectives on the case say the baby suffered numerous injuries that are consistent with shaken baby syndrome. The victim will likely suffer from the effects of his injuries for the rest of his life, they say.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office issued an arrest warrant for Craig after the incident. Deputies say she fled the county but was found Tuesday in Polk County.

671,Report: Suspected sex trafficking victim gave police look at life inside Vero Beach spa,"CLOSE An undercover law enforcement official was offered sexual acts for pay while at AA Spa in Sebastian. The spa was one of 10 Florida spas raided in a prostitution crackdown potentially linked to a Chinese human trafficking ring in February 2019. CONTRIBUTED VIDEO FROM SEBASTIAN POLICE DEPARTMENT, Treasure Coast Newspapers

VERO BEACH — Three women charged with prostitution after the February raid on a Vero Beach massage parlor told police they had no knowledge of illicit activities at the spa and were free to come and go as they pleased.

But one woman, a suspected victim of human trafficking identified in redacted police reports only as ""Jane Doe #9,"" told a much different story.

In an interview with investigators, recounted in a case report, she described an atmosphere of intimidation that made her feel trapped, fearful and pressured to perform sex acts for money.

East Spa, in downtown Vero Beach, was one of 10 spas targeted by law enforcement in a coordinated series of raids Feb. 19 in the Treasure Coast, Jupiter and Orlando. Authorities said the spas were fronts for prostitution with suspected links to human trafficking from China.

The woman told police she arrived at East Spa from New York a week before the raid, after connecting with spa manager Lanyun Ma through an ad on a Chinese-language digital news site.

Lanyun Ma, 49, of Orlando, was charged with human trafficking, racketeering, unlawful transportation for the purpose of prostitution, deriving support from proceeds of prostitution and engaging in prostitution. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY VERO BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT)

She was confined to the building almost immediately on arrival, she said. She could not leave to buy food or groceries without supervision by Ma or Ma’s husband and was required to live at the spa, for which she paid a fee of $10 a day.

Expecting to work as a masseuse, she said, on her second day Ma told her she would have to perform sex acts on clients, which she told investigators she did, reluctantly, at Ma's behest.

Persistent feelings of fear and intimidation kept her in line, she said.

She told police she was ""afraid to disobey"" Ma, who had taken a photo of her identification and knew where her family lived in New York. She suspected she was being watched by cameras placed around the spa, which she said forced her to ""be careful"" around customers and the other women.

Ma herself was ""cold"" and ""very strict,"" sometimes to the point of being verbally abusive, the woman told police. Laser-focused on the bottom line, she said, Ma pressured the women to satisfy their clients needs, illicit or otherwise.

Fear of upsetting Ma kept her from leaving, the woman said. Had police not intervened, she said she would have been moved from the spa in early March as part of a ""rotation of girls"" meant to attract customers.

The woman, who has not been charged with a crime, was transferred to ""appropriate human trafficking services"" following the interview and moved to a safe location for further assistance, police said.

Ma remains the only person charged with human trafficking in a wide-ranging investigation involving multiple agencies and hundreds of arrests across the Treasure Coast.

She was released April 9 on $155,500 bail from the Indian River County Jail and is awaiting trial at her Orlando home.

Police said on April 30, 2016, officers responded to a home on West Franklin Street in reference to an injured woman.

She was transported to a local hospital, where she later died.

Investigators said her death was ruled a homicide.

Officers said the suspect was probably someone the victim trusted and knew.

Mike Bryant in a 2016 interview. ""But it was somebody who somehow got into the house, had her trust for a little while and for some reason the visit went bad.""

673,Missing St. Cloud woman found and in good health,"- A St. Cloud woman with the mental capacity of a 13-year-old has been found safe after going missing earlier this month.

20-year-old Faith Kepner went missing on April 19th after leaving her residence on foot. She was spotted via surveillance video at the Walmart Neighborhood Market on Nolte Road, but she did not return home.

Police reported her missing and endangered, as she lacked the mental capacity for her age due to a disability. They soon learned though that Faith had told a bus operator that she had intentions to travel to north Florida, leading police to believe that she left home voluntarily.

On Tuesday, the St. Cloud Police Department reported that Faith was recovered in good health.

681,Our caring community shows kindness in many ways,"Rev. Candace McKibben (Photo: Candace McKibben)

On Tuesday past, Jason Rosenthal, the husband referenced in the March 3, 2017, New York Times Modern Love article, “You May Want to Marry My Husband,” spoke to nearly 200 people at the Goodwood Museum Carriage House. His compelling story, told with such passion and beauty, left us all thinking about important life matters.

At dinner afterwards and on a morning walk the next day, Jason made the same assessment of our community. “It is beautiful the way you people take care of each other,” he said with a bit of wonderment.

He had heard from my husband, Bruce, who picked him up at the airport, about his work as a volunteer with AmeriCorps through Big Bend Hospice. He had heard from me about the Tallahassee Area Threshold Choir singing to my mother in her dying days. He had felt the helpfulness of the Midtown Reader crew who had ordered not only his book for sale, but other popular titles by his late wife, Amy.

He saw the helpful crew of volunteers from Big Bend Hospice and the Community Advance Care Planning Encouragement Task Force assisting in the setup at Goodwood. And then he met you, the people of our community, who made a very positive impression on his spirit. He began his presentation with a short movie by his wife on kindness. It was what he felt in his interactions with you.

We took our walk at the Fred George Greenway, a beautiful, but rustic place to walk. He, a Chicago attorney, and I, a person with absolutely no navigational instincts, really did not know which of the apparent paths to take. A lovely woman named Mary was stretching after her walk. When I asked her which path, she said let me show you the options. Her kindness was icing on the cake for Jason and for me. We do live in a community that cares about each other.

Jason Rosenthal, left forward, at dinner with Candace, Bruce, and Paul Malley, left back. (Photo: Candace McKibben)

I am so grateful for the care I have received in the past few weeks since my mother’s death. Many of you have sent cards with lovely messages of encouragement and hope. One that touched me deeply said, “The very one who rocked you in the beginning needed you most in the end.” It was so true and I am so grateful for the caring of many in our community to help me support my mother until the end and now to help me grieve her death.

This week in the faith community, our Jewish brothers and sisters have observed Yom HaShoah. HaShoah is a Hebrew word for catastrophe or utter destruction.

Since 1953 when the observance was established in Israel, persons of the Jewish faith have set aside this day to reflect on what was done to their people, approximately 6 million of them, in the Holocaust, a Greek word for sacrifice by fire. This day is not the United Nations’ organized Holocaust Remembrance Day that is held on Jan. 27, worldwide, but a day of reflection within the Jewish faith community.

It grieves my spirit that this year there is more hatred and acts of violence toward Jews across the world than we have seen since we first started documenting anti-Semitism. I think of the ways we need to exercise our caring spirit that is evident to Jason, a stranger coming to our community for the first time, as we support our Jewish neighbors and look for ways to take care of those who are experiencing hate at record levels.

We join our voices with theirs saying, “Never again.”

Our Muslim friends in this community and around the world begin Ramadan on Monday, May 6.

One of the five pillars of Islam, Ramadan involves a month of fasting from food and drink during the sunlight hours. Muslims focus instead on self-discipline, gratitude, and compassion during this their most holy month of the year. They come to this sacred time this year with increasing concern over growing hatred toward Muslims worldwide.

Again our community can demonstrate our characteristic caring spirit to the Muslims in our midst.

I felt so proud to hear Jason’s observation that we are a caring community and couldn’t agree more. May we continue to find ways to take care of each other with all of our differences and our common core of human kindness. Jason’s wife Amy said it is fundamental. I agree.

683,From Denzel Washington to Joe Pesci: What movies were filmed in Southwest Florida?,"Denzel Washington spent time here. So did Ernest Borgnine and Sean Connery and Jane Mansfield, to name a few.

From the Everglades to Boca Grande, Southwest Florida has served as a scenic and steamy backdrop for movies for more than a half century.

Here's a rundown of movies that include the Paradise Coast in their backdrop, from an entire film to glimpses in a scene or two.

""Adaptation"" (2006) — Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park figured prominently in the movie based on Susan Orlean's non-fiction book ""The Orchid Thief"" and a screenwriter's experience trying to adapt the book into a screenplay while suffering from writer's block. The book is about the arrest of a poacher (Chris Cooper's character) and Seminole Indians for stealing rare ghost orchids from Fakahatchee. The film was a critical and box office success, co-starring Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep and Cooper, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

""Hoot"" (2006) — A comedy, ""Hoot"" centers around children trying to save an owl habitat in a small Florida town. Luke Wilson and Brie Larson co-star (with Jimmy Buffett in a minimal role but who also co-produced it) in the film based on Carl Hiaasen's novel of the same name. Mainly filmed on Florida's east coast (including Fort Lauderdale), other locations featured Boca Grande and Gasparilla Island on the Gulf Coast.

""Out of Time"" (2003) — Boca Grande stars again, this time in a thriller featuring actress Eva Mendes and actor Denzel Washington who plays a police officer of a fictional Florida Keys city. Critics were lukewarm about the film, but few could complain about the Gulf-side setting.

""Palmetto"" (1998) — Woody Harrelson plays a journalist jailed in a corruption scandal, with Elisabeth Shue co-starring. Fort Myers plays a small role in the movie that received a 38 percent score from Rotten Tomatoes.

""Gone Fishin'"" (1997) — This Disney comedy co-starring Danny Glover and Joe Pesci is about two goofy buddies from New Jersey who go fishing in Florida. The movie was filmed near Marco Island, Naples and other parts of Southwest Florida but was a box office flop. And a stuntwoman died during filming when a stunt boat went out of control and hit the woman in another boat north of Goodland Bay. Her husband and others on the set suffered minor injuries.

""Striptease"" (1996) — Demi Moore bared more than her soul in this film that also stars Burt Reynolds and is based on the 1993 Carl Hiaasen novel of the same name. Primarily filmed in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Clewiston also played a role in this comedy that critics widely panned and some believe contributed to the demise of Moore's cinematic career.

""Just Cause"" (1995) — Sean Connery plays a Harvard professor, and Laurence Fishbourne a detective. The thriller's movie poster reads: ""Deep in the Florida Everglades is a secret that can save an innocent man or let a killer kill again."" Filming took place throughout Florida, including parts of Lee and Collier counties and Bonita Springs and Fort Myers.

""Captiva Island"" (1995) — Amazon doesn't even sell it in DVD or VHS form and, if it did, save your money unless you want to see the serene scenery shot on this Southwest Florida treasure. Ernest Borgnine and Arte Johnson co-star in the comedy about a teen who finds an attractive girl while visiting the Gulf island while also meeting three goofy pensioners always hatching schemes.

""Coupe de Ville"" (1990) — Shot partially in Cape Coral, the comedy drama starred Patrick Dempsey is one of three brothers asked by their father to drive a 1954 Cadillac from Detroit to Florida for their mother. A box office bomb, the movie generated less than $70,000 revenue in its opening weekend across the U.S. that spring.

""Day of the Dead"" (1985) — This American zombie film is about zombies who have overtaken the world and scientists and soldiers hidden in an Everglades facility working to find a solution. Fort Myers figures prominently in the George A. Romero film, completing his ""Night of the Living Dead"" trilogy.

""Night Moves"" (1975) — Gene Hackman portrays a retired football player in Los Angeles. In his new job as a private investigator, he finds that his wife (Susan Clark) is having an affair with another man while working another case.

'Wind Across the Everglades"" (1958) — Burl Ives, Christopher Plummer and Gypsy Rose Lee visited Southwest Florida for filming in Chokoloskee. The movie is about bird poachers who want the feathers for women's hats. Director Nicholas Ray (""Rebel Without A Cause"") beautifully captures the region. The movie also marks the big-screen debut of Peter Falk (""Columbo,"" popular cop show in the 1970s).

The film also features the handicraft of Budd Schulberg, who, along with his brother Stuart, wrote and co-produced the film. Budd Schulberg was best known for his original screenplay in the 1954 crime drama classic ""On The Waterfront,"" which won him an Academy Award.

685,"Fort Lauderdale man accused of repeatedly beating 3 children at home, gym","Jayce Ja'von Monroe, 32, is accused of beating his three young children.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A Fort Lauderdale man was arrested Wednesday on three counts of aggravated child abuse for repeatedly beating his three young children at his home, inside his car and at his gym, authorities said.

According to an arrest report, Jayce Ja'von Monroe, 32, beat his children with extension cords and belts, causing permanent scars throughout their bodies.

Fort Lauderdale police said child protective investigators first interviewed the children on April 5.

Police said one of the children had several open and scabbed lash marks to his arms.

He told investigators his father beat him with an extension cord for writing a bad word on the sidewalk outside Monroe's gym -- JJ's Boxing Gym at 1782 NW 38th Ave. in Lauderhill, authorities said.

According to the arrest report, one child had 29 ""linear"" and ""curvilinear"" new and old loop marks throughout their body. The child told investigators Monroe struck the victim with a cord while they were inside the father's Ford SUV in the parking lot of the gym, authorities said.

Police said another child had wounds on their shoulders, triceps, biceps, forearms, back, sides of their chest, waist, front thighs, ankles and calves.

During another interview with the children on April 23, one of the victims told investigators he gets hit by his father for bad behavior with a cord or with a belt on his arms and legs.

Police said the child told investigators, ""I get lucky sometimes and don't bleed.""

According to the arrest report, the child said the most recent beating occurred at Monroe's gym and said, ""He whopped me and when he saw me bleeding, he felt bad and put cocoa butter on it.""

Police said Monroe took his children to Taco Bell after the incident, but did not get the child who was beaten any food.

Authorities said Monroe's wife, who is the mother of his three children, was also interviewed by investigators and was aware that her husband beat one of their children March 27 for writing the bad word on the sidewalk. She said she saw the injuries March 30 while at her child's track meet.

Investigators said the child's injuries were still healing nearly a month after the beating.

According to the arrest report, the woman said she had called Women in Distress to help her and her children escape future abuse from Monroe.

Monroe is being held at the Broward County Main Jail.

College-based issues a great concern

Ed Taylor’s recent letter about college education was a conservative screed full of rants but lacking facts. Only a very small portion of the U.S. Department of Education’s budget consists of loans to college attendees. The U.S. has now fallen to 13th place in the world in percentage of population with a college degree — behind Russia and even Lithuania.

The value of a college degree is undeniable. Statistics show college graduates will earn an average $24,000 a year more than non-graduates for a lifetime gain of $1 million over non-graduates.

Artificial intelligence and automation are expected to make jobs more interesting but may eliminate 20 to 25 percent of current jobs in coming years and reduce wages for many others. But they will add jobs for those who are multi-talented and skilled in critical thinking. That’s critical in a knowledge industry-driven world. Tech companies are driving our country and our world, and they’re searching for employees who are trained in STEM and have complementary skills in soft skills of communications, business and humanities.

But this is the seventh year in a row that college admissions have decreased due to increased tuition and staggering student loans. Combined with our decreasing place in the world, we need to be concerned. This is a critical issue for our country. This should be a MAGA issue.

Many Democrats are pushing to help fund college tuition and repay loans. Personally, I would rather do that than give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations.

Column on GOP has 'gaps'

Recent guest columnist Carolyn Perrine says she left the Republican Party because of learning about ""gaps"" in her public school education. She included in those gaps a litany of supposedly historical American evils. Apparently in the process of ""soaking up"" history (as she put it) there are still some blatant gaps.



Lets just pick the low-hanging fruit. Her litany begins with ""Native American extermination,"" the worst of which was the Cherokee ""Trail of Tears"" perpetrated by President Andrew Jackson — a Democrat. She then mentions segregation, which was solely the result of southern state laws enacted by Democrats in reaction to post-Civil War Reconstruction laws protecting former slaves enacted by the Republican-controlled federal government. That, of course, followed the emancipation of the slaves by (wait for it) — Republican President Abraham Lincoln.



She mentions U.S. internment camps, presumably meaning those which held Japanese-Americans during World War II. Those camps were established under an executive order by Democrat President Franklin Roosevelt. As to exactly how the Holocaust (another on her list) was an American evil escapes me completely — unless she is referring to how President Roosevelt refused to allow any but very few German Jewish refugees from the Nazis to enter the United States.

Perrine didn’t “soak up” an education in history. She merely bought into the propaganda which passes for education in contemporary universities. You are free to choose whichever party you wish, Ms. Perrine. But don't try to justify your choice by distorting history.

Respecting a woman's right to choose

One in every four American women has had an abortion. Mull that over. Look around: See your aunt, your cousin, your mom or yourself? Abortion is a modern, sane solution to an age-old problem: unwanted pregnancies, nonviable ones, and deadly ones.

Women are not incubation vessels that belong to men or any government. They are people who have an innate right to full body autonomy. So yes, I'm pro-abortion. And I fully respect each woman's individual and crucial right to choose.

'Set record straight' on CRNAs

I recently read Dr. Jonathan Slonin's misleading opinion piece about Florida's anesthesia professionals, and as a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), I wanted to set the record straight.

The physician supervision Dr. Slonin speaks of already doesn't exist as he would have you believe. In fact, in Florida, CRNAs are not required to work with anesthesiologists in any practice setting. But when we do, it's the CRNAs who usually provide the hands-on care and stay with the patient throughout the procedure, not the anesthesiologists. Many other states have already recognized the important role of CRNAs and no longer require any physician supervision.

Numerous studies have confirmed CRNAs provide safe, high-quality care, further supporting the repeal of these archaic, unnecessary supervision requirements. The truth is, CRNAs are highly educated, highly trained professionals. Nurse anesthetists must complete seven years to eight and a half years of healthcare and anesthesia-related education and more than 9,000 hours of clinical training prior to graduating with an advanced degree. By comparison, anesthesiologists typically obtain eight years of healthcare and anesthesia-related education and more than 11,000 hours of clinical training. The anesthesia-specific education and training both receive is about the same.

At the end of the day, we all agree the safety and well-being of patients is paramount. But CRNAs are absolutely qualified to deliver every type of anesthetic for every type of procedure to every type of patient in every type of facility, without the oversight of anesthesiologists. We should be allowed to practice to the full extent of our abilities.

696,‘Dignity' for incarcerated women en route to Florida governor,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Women who are incarcerated in Florida could soon have access to adequate feminine products, such as tampons and sanitary napkins, under a bill on its way to Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The House on Monday unanimously approved the “Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act,” which would require prisons and jails to provide female inmates with certain health-care products at no cost.

The Senate unanimously passed the measure (HB 49) last week.

The proposal would require prisons and jails to make “health care products” -- including tampons, moisturizing soap that is not lye-based, toothbrushes and toothpaste -- available to female inmates “at no cost to the woman in a quantity that is appropriate to the needs of the woman.”

The products must be available “in common housing areas,” so that women don’t have to request them from guards.

The proposal also would require that pat downs and strip searches of inmates be done by female guards and would ban male corrections officers from entering showers, restrooms or other places where incarcerated women may be undressed, policies that are already in place in some facilities.

Mariah Cain and Jeff Elkins have always dreamed of flying.

Not within the confines of a helicopter or airplane, but unenclosed, immersed in their surroundings and soaring over hills and waterscapes.

It’s no longer just a fantasy.

The Panama City duo has designed the Airboard, a personal flight device that lifts off the ground using eight motors, maneuvered by body movement. Cain is its pilot and project manager, and Elkins is the brains behind the mechanics, along with colleague Ray Brandes.

""Team Dragonair"" is one of five Phase II winners of the GoFly Prize, a global challenge to create a safe, quiet and compact flying device that can travel 20 miles without refueling or recharging.

“We don't really call it flying ... it's levitating, it's lifting. You can just sit in one spot like a helicopter, but it doesn't cost $2 million and anybody can do it,” Elkins said.

The 56-year-old inventor has worked in the field of prosthetics, created LED suits and architectural renderings. His fascination with electronics started with designing model airplanes in his high school wood shop class.

Cain used to work at a 3D imaging company in Arizona, proofreading manuals. As a little girl, she tinkered with her grandfather in his metalworking shop in their small hometown of Thatcher, Arizona.

With aviation a male-dominated field, Cain aims to break gender norms and expectations.

Thrill isn't new to the nimble 24-year-old athlete, who met Elkins playing Hydroflight, where people on hoverboards are propelled into the air by water-jet propulsion. Together they merged their skills in building, testing and flying the Airboard.

“It lifts from underneath you so since you're on top of it, it doesn't feel like you're flying a machine. It just feels like you're gliding in the air, like you're sliding across ice,” said Cain, who’s the only woman captain among the Phase II winners.

In a video, she’s seen standing on the Airboard prototype, gliding in mid-air over a lake in St. Marys, Georgia.

The electric-powered Airboard can push 100 feet into the air and zoom as the pilot stands buckled in the middle holding two poles. The prototype can only operate for five minutes after take-off, but the team has been toiling in the shop working on the Airboard 2.0, which will be able to fly for more than 30 minutes, Elkins said.

Sponsored by Boeing, the GoFly competition, founded by entrepreneur Gwen Lighter, will award a grand prize winner in the fall.

“The way that we fly now in these big airplanes is not what anyone pictured. It's this experience of flying yourself around like you are a bird unguided through the air,” Cain said. “I've certainly been dreaming of it since I was a little girl. And getting to experience this now — it's unlike anything else.”

Safety measures are in place that allow the Airboard to continue to fly even if half the motors glitch, according to a press release, and the team is also incorporating a parachute system.

Elkins compares the aerial vehicle to a “motorcycle in the sky” and a ""Jetsons"" car.

The team hopes their device can be replicated and used for fun, but also employed in rescue efforts or other industry-specific needs.

“I'm just going to keep working on this for the rest of my life,” Elkins said. “However long it takes to get this to be something mainstream and acceptable.”

According to deputies, the victim used BrightStar Care medical staffing to help her with chores around her home in unincorporated Longwood.

After contacting Porras to tell him she was unhappy with the worker that they sent her and requesting a new one, Porras reportedly went to her home to discuss their services. The victim claims that during their conversation, Porras began making inappropriate advances and eventually raped her for more than an hour.

A sheriff's office report states that after the assault, Porras got dressed and began discussing business like nothing had happened. Deputies said that evidence at the scene matches what the victim described.

Deputies are now concerned that there are more victims and are asking anyone with information to come forward.

Kingston Crowell and Marion County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremie Nix have a strong bond. From the toddler's first birthday in January to frequent play dates and visiting on Christmas, Kingston has been part of the family to Jeremie Nix and his wife Nikki for the past year, ever since the deputy helped save his life.When Kingston stopped breathing on May 9, 2018, his frantic mother and her sister pulled over and flagged down the deputy. He was captured on dashcam video doing CPR, but when that didn't work, he rushed the baby to Ocala Regional, where doctors revived the child.""I think it was a God thing. I think it was the right place, right time and being put in that position for the right reason,"" Jeremie Nix said. ""I remember dropping to my knees and just screaming, 'Thank God!' I could breathe!"" Nechole Crowell, Kingston's mother, said.Months later, Crowell asked the Jeremie and Nikki Nix to be Kingston's godparents, and the two families adopted one another.""Like we were kind of attached from the moment it happened. He just said, 'I'm not leaving your son, until I know he's OK' and it's just been him and Nikki since,"" Crowell said.But over time, the union forged by a life-threatening emergency on the side of the road has evolved into something unexpectedly special.Kingston's fight for survival has spawned a relationship that's changing culture in both families: a woman seeing past the uniform to a hero, and a cop understanding the struggles of a single mother working full-time and earning a nursing degree.""So, it's opened a door to have conversations and create new relationships and friends that we would have never had before,"" Jeremie Nix said.""It doesn't have to be blood related to be family and it doesn't have to be just your family to teach life lessons,"" Crowell said. ""And so he has another family that can teach him a lot more and we can all work together.

LUCIE COUNTY — A 21-year-old man accused in a home invasion robbery and an attempted sexual battery last year was apprehended after two women identified his picture, according to arrest and court records obtained Thursday.

Corl Lamos Jones, of Homestead, was arrested Wednesday and held in the St. Lucie County Jail on charges including attempted sexual battery with great force or deadly weapon, burglary of an occupied dwelling with an assault or battery while armed with a firearm, home invasion robbery with a firearm and grand theft motor vehicle.

Jones is accused Feb. 17, 2018, of confronting a woman in St. Lucie County who told investigators she was by herself in her home.

She said she was in her bedroom and noticed a man standing in the doorway to her closet. The man had her wallet in one hand, and a handgun in the other.

The man said he wanted money, but then said he wanted sex. Scared, the woman said she agreed as he still had the handgun. She said he made advances, but she was able to run out to a neighbor’s home to call 911.

Within about 40 minutes at a home less than 2 miles away, investigators said another violent incident occurred.

A woman said she was watching television in her den, and saw a man in the doorway.

She said he demanded money and pointed a handgun at her.

She gave him money, and he took the keys to her Buick. She said he drove away in the vehicle, which sheriff’s officials said turned up the next day in Vero Beach.

A few days later, one of the women told sheriff’s investigators she recognized a mugshot while browsing an Indian River County sheriff’s social media site.

That person was Jones, who investigators said had been arrested two days after the incidents in St. Lucie County. At the time, investigators said he had a BB gun that looked like a real firearm, a pocket knife and other items.

Sheriff’s officials said Jones was linked to both cases in St. Lucie County.

He was held Thursday on no bond, a jail official said.

716,'Dignity' for incarcerated women en route to Governor,"- Women who are incarcerated in Florida could soon have access to adequate feminine products, such as tampons and sanitary napkins, under a bill on its way to Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The House on Monday unanimously approved the “Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act,” which would require prisons and jails to provide female inmates with certain health-care products at no cost.

The Senate unanimously passed the measure (HB 49) last week.

The proposal would require prisons and jails to make “health care products” --- including tampons, moisturizing soap that is not lye-based, toothbrushes and toothpaste --- available to female inmates “at no cost to the woman in a quantity that is appropriate to the needs of the woman.” The products must be available “in common housing areas,” so that women don’t have to request them from guards.

The proposal also would require that pat downs and strip searches of inmates be done by female guards and would ban male corrections officers from entering showers, restrooms or other places where incarcerated women may be undressed, policies that are already in place in some facilities.

Deputies said they received an alert Monday from a license plate reader that a Land Rover stolen during an armed carjacking in North Miami was in Orange City.

A deputy tried to conduct a traffic stop, but the vehicle fled, according to the report.

Video from the Volusia County Sheriff's Office helicopter unit shows the Land Rover running a red light and speeding on Interstate 4 before exiting onto State Road 436 in Seminole County.

Deputies said they found the vehicle abandoned at an apartment complex on Douglas Avenue. Witnesses told them a man in a white tank top and a woman in a black sports bra ran from the vehicle, the affidavit said.

Volusia County K-9 Endo, who was honored with a Purple Heart in 2016 after being shot in the line of duty, was brought to the scene to track down the vehicle's occupants.

Video shows the German shepherd leading a deputy through a wooded area and locating two of the man's sandals before approaching a dumpster.

Behind the dumpster, deputies said they found Jamie Snell and a woman, who both matched the descriptions witnesses provided.

Snell and the woman at first denied being in the stolen Land Rover and said they were just behind the dumpster to have sex, but they both eventually admitted to their involvement, according to the report.

The woman said Snell picked her up in the Land Rover to drive her to a job interview and wanted to stay in the vehicle when they parked it the apartment complex, but she was afraid she would go to jail too, the affidavit said.

Snell was arrested on charges of grand theft auto, fleeing and attempting to elude and resisting an officer without violence.

Details about the armed carjacking in North Miami were not immediately available.

724,Woman walking across USA for homeless vets makes stop in Central Florida,"- A woman walking across the country helping homeless veterans made a stop in Daytona and Flagler Beaches over the weekend.

Kim Denmark walked across 16 states before getting to Florida. She walks with an American flag over her shoulder and carries signs about her mission.

As she walks, she talks to veterans, and in some cases, helps those who are homeless.

“I’m going city-to-city, state-to-state, finding homeless [people] who want to get off the street, get a job, want to be self-sufficient and be independent. And as it relates to veterans, I take them for medical attention, try to find housing for them and a job,” she said. “There’s a lot of homeless veterans out there and I’m reaching out.”

Denmark started in her journey in Ohio. Recently, during a stop in Daytona Beach, she received her 31st pair of shoes. Her shoes get worn out as she walks.

Daytona Beach Police Chief Craig Capri bought them for her.

“He took me to Dicks and we got my 31st pair of shoes. So, I put a 31 to say, 'OK, this is pair 31 now.' I’ll probably get to 70 by the time I get to California.”

Denmark’s goal is to reach Burbank, California to meet Ellen Degeneres.

She hopes Ellen can help her open up a self-sufficiency camp for veterans.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/woman-walking-across-usa-for-homeless-vets-makes-stop-in-central-florida,2019-04-30T02:09:54Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746

An East Naples man accused of holding a teenage girl overnight and sexually battering her was arrested Thursday.

Jose Amaya, 51, picked the girl up from her home on Monday and brought her to JD Auto Repair, where he lived and worked, according to an arrest report from the Collier County Sheriff’s Office.

Amaya was an acquaintance of the victim and knew her from doing auto repairs for her family. The victim was supposed to clean Amaya’s office in exchange for the work he did for her family, according to the report.

The victim, whose name and age were redacted from the report to protect her identity, was from out of the country and moved to the U.S. with her father. Her father was killed in a biking accident shortly after, according to the report.

After her father died, the victim began living with a woman in Golden Gate. After she cleaned Amaya’s office, he refused to take her home, according to the sheriff’s office report.

The victim wanted to leave the auto repair shop but saw Amaya secure the exterior of the door with a key as he left and thought she was locked inside the building with no way out, according to the report.

The victim has a kindergarten education and is timid like a young child, according to the sheriff's office.

731,"Husband kills wife, then himself in what family calls 'mercy shooting'","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The sister of a man who killed his wife and then himself in a San Souci home Wednesday night said he did it because he couldn't stand to see his wife suffer any longer.

Officers found the couple dead in their home on Goltare Drive about 3:30 p.m. when a man called 911 to report that he had shot his wife and was prepared to take his own life.

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office won't identify the victims, but family members said John and Gwendolyn Thombleson died in the home. The husband's sister said after the wife had surgery eight months ago, her health began declining rapidly and she developed several health conditions, including dementia.

The medical bills were piling up, and neighbors told News4Jax that John Thombleson had said their insurance was expiring, leaving them no way to pay for the mounting expenses.

According to police, officers sent to the home made numerous attempts to contact the people inside but the attempts were unsuccessful.

Eventually, members of the SWAT team entered the home, finding the man and woman in a bedroom.

The couple were high school sweethearts and had been married 47 years. John Thombleson was retired and Gwendolyn Thombleson worked for the school district.

This was not a domestic dispute, according to the family. They said they tried to help as much as they could during the time when the wife's health was deteriorating.

Family members called this a mercy killing and said that John Thombleson was motivated by his love for his wife.

The neighbor who lives across the street said the last time he spoke with John Thombleson, the conversation was about the couple potentially losing their home because of their mounting medical bills.

Drazen Klacer, another neighbor, said he never noticed any red flags.

“He was nice guy, older guy, ready to retire,"" Klacer said.

Lisa Veres, a third neighbor, was shocked to hear about what happened.

""You don’t hear of anything like this happening in this neighborhood,"" Veres said. ""We’ve lived here for so long and my husband’s family has lived here for so long, and everybody is just so quiet and so sweet.""

The family is planning the funeral arrangements.

733,"Pasco deputies: Woman posted man's nude photos, asked for $500 to take them down","- A Pasco County woman is accused of using nude photos of a man to try and extort money from him.

Deputies say she managed to change the man’s social media passwords and then posted the pictures on his accounts.

Pasco County deputies say Breyanna Helen Dean used shame and embarrassment to try and manipulate a man into giving her $500.

“These photos were pictures of his genitalia that he took,” attorney Denis DeVlaming explained.

Investigators aren’t saying what Dean’s relationship is to the man or his name, but they arrested Dean’s ex-boyfriend, Christian Belanger-Leppinen, for breaking into her home around the same time she posted the photos.

Continue reading below

Deputies say Dean found the pictures on an old phone. That’s when she apparently devised the scheme and contacted the man demanding payment if he wanted the photos to be deleted.

“This is the first case where I’ve seen a woman doing it to a man,” said DeVlaming.

Dean’s charges stem from the threat of extortion, which is a felony. Some call it ‘sextortion.’

But even without extortion, the simple act of sharing nude photos of someone else, without permission, will get you in trouble.

“If you send it into the internet without the consent of the person of whose picture you’re sending, you’ve committed a crime in Florida,” DeVlaming explained.

That crime is sexual cyber harassment. A first offense is a misdemeanor. Do it again and it’s a felony.

A 2013 study found more than 55% of young adults have sent nude selfies. Law enforcement says it’s leading to more crimes like this.

“It might not even be a monetary request, it might be, ‘You’ll have to meet me here or do this or do that.’ And it’s going to happen more and more,” DeVlaming said.

Madeline Pumariega, who served as chancellor of the Florida College System for three years before resigning in November, has been named executive vice president and provost at Tallahassee Community College, President Jim Murdaugh announced late Wednesday.

Pumariega succeeds Feleccia Moore-Davis, who has served as provost and vice president for academic affairs since 2015. Moore-Davis announced her resignation, for personal reasons, in early April.

She will remain in the position until June 30th.

Pumariega starts May 13 with the added new title of executive vice president.

TCC President Jim Murdaugh (Photo: Special to the Democrat)

“Madeline will fill an important role on TCC’s senior leadership team,” Murdaugh said. “She is an exceptional leader. I believe that her extensive background in higher education, her vision and her record of innovation and collaboration make her an excellent choice for this newly created position.”

As executive vice president, Pumariega will be responsible for ""aligning and advancing the high-impact practices within the college’s three core divisions of academic affairs, student affairs and workforce development,"" the TCC release said.

“I am honored to be joining an institution recognized for its academic excellence and student success,” Pumariega said. “I believe in the values of TCC and the important role that the college plays in the community. I am excited to work with our faculty and staff to build upon this success and the vision President Murdaugh has set for the college.”

TCC spokesman Al Moran said there will be an overlap between Pumariega and Moore-Davis, “which is beneficial to the college.”

Pumariega was appointed chancellor of the Florida College System in August 2015 by Education Commissioner Pam Stewart, making her the first woman and first Hispanic educator to hold the post.

The Florida College System is comprised of 28 colleges with 84 campuses and centers serving over 800,000 students.

Her annual budget was $2.4 billion.

She resigned in November, effective Dec. 3, 2018.

Before that appointment, she was president and CEO of Take Stock in Children, the statewide nonprofit organization focused on creating pathways for students living in poverty to complete high school and move into post secondary education.

From June 2011 to July 2013, she served as president of Miami Dade College’s Wolfson campus in Miami.

It served 30,000 students and had a budget of $65 million.

Graduates show what's possible after addiction recovery

“They gave me my life back. I was going to die if I didn’t get help. I just thought I was going to die a heroin addict.”

This is one of the quotes from the three subjects in a story by health reporter Liz Freeman about Justin’s Place Recovery Program at St. Matthew’s House, a year-long Christian-based substance abuse recovery program with boot camp-like rules.

Stan Schoenewald, right, instructs Trish Conway, left, during a TRX, or total body resistance exercise, class at Kensington Country Club fitness center in Naples on Monday, April 15, 2019. Schoenewald, a recovering alcoholic, went through the Justin's Place Recovery Program at St. Matthew's House after attempting suicide in December 2014. With the help of a grant through St. Matthew's House, Schoenewald got certified as a personal trainer and now works at Kensington, Wyndemere Country Club, and the Greater Naples YMCA. (Photo: Alex Driehaus/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Freeman's story provides details of the programs and the different levels of recovery an addict faces. In the story, she reports the program has graduated 470 former substance abusers since it began in 2010. They are tracked for two years for sobriety and there is an 87 percent success rate, according to St. Matthew's House.

Some graduates have started their own businesses, earned degrees and have careers with opportunities.

From the reporter:

""All three individuals were remarkably candid. What really struck me is how happy they are in their daily lives. I learned a lot about gratitude from them.

""I wanted them to think about it for a day or two before I met with them. One woman backed down. With a sensitive story like this, it’s important to let them set the pace of what they shared.""

738,Off-duty deputy who shot dog cleared by internal affairs,"CLAY COUNTY, Fla. - An internal affairs investigation determined that an off-duty Clay County Sheriff's Office deputy who shot and killed a dog at a public park in Lake Asbury was justified in his actions.

According to the Sheriff's Office, the internal affairs review found that no agency policies were violated. The case was closed as a non-offense, and the internal affairs review reflected that as well.

ORIGINAL STORY: Dog shot, killed by off-duty deputy at Clay County park

Originally, a Sheriff's Office spokesperson told News4Jax that, ""This was not an on-duty case, so we do not have a statement to provide."" On Tuesday night, the Sheriff's Office made the following post addressing the investigation, which included the original incident report:

According to the incident report, the owner's friend who was watching the dog took his leash off so he could run and play while they were at the park. The woman said the dog, Parker, got excited when he saw Clay County Sheriff's Office Lt. Mark Cowan and his dog and ran toward them.

The incident report stated that the deputy felt threatened. Cowan said he thought Parker looked like a pit bull that appeared to be about 40 to 50 pounds. Cowan said he yelled at Parker to stop and the dog did not. ""In fear for his safety and his dog's,"" the report states, Cowan drew his own personal handgun and fired.

A Silver Springs woman on probation for drug possession has been arrested for having, and for getting rid of, illegal drugs during a raid at her residence.

A deputy was called Monday to the home of Traci Allen, 46, in the 500 block of Northeast 167th Avenue in Silver Springs, by a Florida Department of Corrections officer. The DOC official said they had gotten word that Allen, who is on probation for involuntary manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance, was selling drugs from the home.

Officers with Probation and Parole removed several people from the home. Authorities found a pipe in Allen’s room that tested positive for methamphetamine residue. Allen was asked if there were drugs in the home and she said she threw a bag of drugs under a probation officer’s vehicle when the person was distracted.

Marion County Sheriff's Office Deputy Walter Ray recovered bags that contained about 14 grams of meth and fewer than 20 grams of marijuana.

Allen was arrested on charges of trafficking in meth and possession of marijuana and was taken to the Marion County Jail, where she remained Wednesday on no bond.

According to The Telegraph newspaper in Georgia, Allen pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death of her daughter at a hotel in 2010 and possession of methadone with intent to distribute in 2014. Allen was sentenced to nine years in prison and 11 years probation.

Just this month, alligators have been seen knocking on people’s windows, disrupting golf tournaments and crossing busy streets.

Aside from roaming farther from the water in search for mates, alligators also bellow — a prehistoric sound that was caught on video at a Florida zoo last week.

READ MORE @FOXNEWS

In a video posted on Facebook from the Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens in Naples, Florida, three alligators can be seen bobbing in the water, making loud growling or roaring sounds.

A person nearby can be heard comparing the sound to dinosaurs.

“It sounds like something out of Jurassic Park,” the person is overheard saying.

According to the zoo’s caption on the video, alligators bellow all year, but they do it more often during mating season.



“Alligators also may bellow to communicate size to each other,” the zoo said. “While both males and females bellow, males can reach a lower frequency, which causes the water to ‘dance’ on their backs, like you can see here with the gator in the middle!”

One commenter wrote: “Good thing they are at the zoo and not in my yard!”

Another person said: “To me, that sound means, ‘I'm going to est (sic) you alive if you come near me!’”

Someone else joked about snoring, saying: “From what I'm told, this is me sleeping.”

According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), alligators begin courting in early April and mate in May or June.

Aside from roaming farther from their lagoons, warmer temperatures also revs up alligators’ metabolism, making them more active and aggressive as they hunt for prey and mate.

The FWC recommends not swimming during dusk or dawn — an alligator’s most active hours — keeping animals on a leash and away from water and keeping a safe distance if they come into contact with the large creature.

741,Former Minneapolis police officer found guilty for ﻿fatally shooting woman while responding to her 911 call,"Advertisement Former Minneapolis police officer found guilty for ﻿fatally shooting woman while responding to her 911 call Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Former Minneapolis Police Officer Mohamed Noor was found guilty Tuesday of third-degree murder and manslaughter for fatally shooting Justine Ruszczyk while responding to her 911 call.The jury of 10 men and two women acquitted Noor on an additional count of second-degree murder in the killing.Noor, a 33-year-old Somali-American, is believed to be the first police officer to be convicted of murder in Minnesota in recent memory, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said.Noor sat quietly with his hands clasped as the verdict was read. He was immediately taken into custody and led out of the courtroom in handcuffs.He faces up to 12 and a half years for third-degree murder and four years for second-degree manslaughter. The judge set a sentencing date of June 7.The fallout from the shootingNoor's lawyer said a ""perfect storm"" of events led him to open fire on Ruszczyk the night of July 15, 2017, when she called 911 to report a possible assault in progress in an alley behind her Minneapolis home.Noor testified that he feared for his partner's life as Ruszczyk approached their squad car in the dark, empty alley. But Hennepin County prosecutors said Noor overreacted and failed to properly assess the situation before firing a gunshot into Ruszczyk's abdomen.Ruszczyk's death drew widespread attention, in the United States and in her native Australia. She had moved to Minneapolis to be with her fiancé and was killed a month before her wedding.Members of the Australian media packed the courtroom along with Ruszczyk's family, and representatives of the Somali community in Minneapolis.Ruszczyk's family said in a statement that they were satisfied with the verdict.Her fiancé, Don Damond, said he hoped her death would lead to further reform of MPD's procedures and policies. He noted that MPD squad cars bear the motto, ""To protect with courage, to serve with compassion.""""Where were those values that night?"" he asked.""She called them because she needed them to protect with courage and serve with compassion,"" he said. ""But that night, there was a tragic lack of care and compassion for the sanctity of life.""The shooting cast a harsh spotlight on the Minneapolis Police Department and the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for its handling of the investigation, culminating in the resignation of Minneapolis' police chief and a change in the department's body camera policy.Ruszczyk's case also drew comparisons to the killing of Philando Castile, a black man shot by a police officer in Minnesota one year earlier. Some observers wondered during the trial if the cases would receive disparate treatment because of the race of the victims.After the verdict, Freeman, the Hennepin county attorney, rejected the idea that race played a factor in the decision to prosecute Noor.""We have to look at each case based on the facts and the evidence and the law in front of us,"" he said.The evidence in this case, he said, ""showed that the officer acted unreasonable.""What the witnesses saidSixty witnesses testified during the nearly month-long trial, including use-of-force experts, neighbors, and Noor's partner, Matthew Harrity.Harrity was behind the wheel of their squad car when Noor shot Ruszczyk from the passenger seat. He testified that he was startled by a noise on the rear driver's side door as Ruszczyk approached the vehicle, according to CNN affiliate WCCO.Noor took the witness stand toward the trial's end, testifying that Harrity's terrified expression and the sight of Ruszczyk with her hand raised jolted him into action. Although he did not see a gun in Ruszczyks' hand, he feared his partner might be shot as she began to raise her hand, he said.Two neighbors testified they heard a sound that the defense argued could have been Ruszczyk slapping the squad car. But the prosecution argued the slap did not happen, based on expert testimony that none of the fingerprints found on the squad car matched Ruszczyk's.Dueling experts differed on whether Noor's use of force was reasonable and therefore justified.Testifying for the prosecution, Lt. Derrick Hacker of the Crystal Police Department in Minnesota said that Noor's use of deadly force was ""excessive and objectively unreasonable.""Being ""startled"" is different than ""fearing death or great bodily harm,"" Hacker said.Testifying for the defense, lawyer and use of force expert Emanuel Kapelsohn said Noor's conduct was an ""objectively reasonable"" response to the situation.""It's late at night. It's dark in the alley,"" Kapelsohn said, noting Noor heard his partner say ""oh Jesus.""What the lawyers arguedHennepin County Attorney Amy Sweasy said in her closing argument Monday that the appearance of a woman in the alley should not have surprised the officers.Sweasy repeatedly pointed out that Noor never said he had saved his partner's life when discussing the shooting with other officers, something she said he surely would have mentioned given his claims that he feared for his life.""Wouldn't that have been a good time to say it?"" Sweasy asked Noor when he was on the stand.Noor said he couldn't remember all the events of the shooting, which he described as a ""traumatic experience.""In his closing argument, defense attorney Tom Plunkett said now was not the time for ""Monday morning quarterbacking.""""An officer may use deadly force to protect themselves or others from apparent danger"" Plunkett said.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/former-minneapolis-police-officer-found-guilty-for-fatally-shooting-woman-while-responding-to-her-911-call/27330620,2019-05-01T12:25:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
742,Brevard County deputy fired after getting shot in Jacksonville post-rodeo brawl,"For the second time in just over a year, a decorated deputy has been fired by Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey after being involved in shooting incident while off duty.

In the latest incident, Deputy Jason Roberts — credited by the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office in January for his role in a multi-agency investigation of an overdose death — faced potential criminal charges after he was shot and wounded in February in a Jacksonville hotel room.

Records obtained by FLORIDA TODAY Tuesday show that Ivey fired Roberts after an administrative investigation found the deputy ""operated outside the boundaries"" of department rules.

“The investigation was initiated over concerns that you failed to adhere to established agency policies,” Ivey wrote in the memo. “…specifically that while off-duty and visiting Jacksonville, Florida, you were intoxicated and physically attacked another guest of a hotel. The victim then armed himself with a handgun and shot you in self-defense to stop the alleged unprovoked attack,” wrote Ivey, who said Roberts also refused to cooperate with the investigation.

Roberts was off duty, attending a rodeo in Jacksonville, with his fiancee, who used to work for the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office as a community services specialist, when he was shot several times by a motorcycle club member the couple had met hours earlier.

The Duval County state attorney's office declined to prosecute either the shooter — described as ""shaken"" by the incident — or Roberts, who agents said attacked the shooter.

""Although there is probable cause to bring charges against Roberts for striking (the shooter), proving this case beyond a reasonable doubt may prove challenging although certainly not impossible,"" Assistant State Attorney Joseph Licandro wrote in an assessment of the case. ""Ultimately, the state will respect (the shooter's) wishes that charges not be pursued in this matter,"" Licandro wrote.

At the time of the shooting, the Sheriff's Office would not release the deputy's name or confirm that he was involved in the incident. In subsequent weeks, the Sheriff's Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Space Coast Daily, a Brevard County-based online publication often used by the Sheriff's Office to break news, first reported Roberts dismissal on Monday. Sheriff Ivey often writes reports for the publication. FLORIDA TODAY previously filed multiple public records requests to get the the information, which was released to other media Tuesday.

THE SHOOTING

The Jacksonville shooting took place on Feb. 17 at the Lexington Hotel. Duval County Sheriff’s investigators reported that Roberts and his fiancee had met a Michael Donn of Georgia, a member of the #1 Stunnas Motor Sport Club, a motorcycle group

Roberts, his fiancee, and Donn at some point decided to go back to the hotel with a bottle of cognac, reports show. Donn told investigators that Roberts had talked to him about ""moving"" kilos of narcotics, reports show.

At some point, according to the reports, Roberts' fiancee locked herself in the hotel room bathroom, prompting Roberts to try to kick down the door. Donn attempted to calm Roberts, who responded by hitting him, reports show. Investigators said Roberts grabbed his fiancee when Donn attempted to intervene and help her.

Roberts and Donn struggled for a moment when Donn reached for his own handgun. Roberts was quoted as saying, “You ain’t going to do nothing. I’m going to destroy you.”

Donn, investigators said, feared for his life and fired a shot. The biker fired two more times after Roberts jumped at him, throwing punches.

Local deputies arrived and found blood along the walls, several shell casings and a tooth on the floor.

""Call 911, I just shot a guy,"" the biker was heard saying, the report shows. A woman with Donn's motorcycle club attempted to help Roberts as he lie wounded.

Roberts was rushed to the University of Florida Shands hospital. Jacksonville authorities then notified the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office. Todd Goodyear, BCSO spokesman, would not confirm local reports that Sheriff Ivey and senior staff members traveled to Jacksonville in response to the shooting.

Roberts was hired by the agency in 2009. He was part of drug trafficking investigation in 2018 that began with the discovery of a woman’s body in a Melbourne ditch. Agents — including Roberts — led to the arrest of a suspect on federal charges. In January, the sheriff’s office recognized Roberts with a meritorious service award for his work on the case.

A 'PATTERN OF SUBSTANDARD BEHAVIOR'

In his memo, Ivey wrote that Roberts appeared to have a ""documented pattern of substandard behavior."" Records show nine separate instances where Roberts was given letters of reprimand or written counseling for department violations ranging from intoxication on and off duty, substandard performance in several cases.

Another former deputy Nick Worthy was fired by Ivey in March 2018, after Worthy's neighbors reported hearing gunshots and a woman's scream come from Worthy's home. Deputies arrived to find Worthy's 2-year-old child living in squalid conditions, along with small amounts of cocaine and marijuana.

Worthy, 29, and his girlfriend, Rachel Trexler, 32, were charged with two felonies, including child neglect without great bodily harm and possession of cocaine.

Worthy had been named law enforcement of the year in 2016, but, following his arrest and dismissal it emerged that he too had several reprimands and patterns of behavior not consistent with agency rules, records show.

Roberts has the right to appeal the sheriff's decision.

While the state of Florida works to make sure consumers are actually getting what they pay for, in the meantime, it's buyer beware.

""It's one of the few CBD products out ther that has that certification."", said Rena Greenberg.

A 2017 study in the Journal of American Medical Association found 70 percent of CBD products where mislabeled.

Greenberg suggest making sure you are buying a full spectrum CBD product.

""That's another important distinction for viewers to realize you see CBD, and shoppers may not realize there is a big difference between full spectrum CBD and a simple CBD label. CBD full spectrum uses the whole plant, all the Cannabinoids in the plant and that's what gives it the medicinal value."" said Greenburg.

Everyone will get a safety briefing to see how to handle a firearm and them it's off for some fun. Certified instructors will also be out to work one-on-one with those who need it.

""We're gonna have several stations that include some of our program material to help them learn about the outdoors, how to live with the wildlife; how to camp properly and how to navigate out in the woods and such,"" Dave Sklarek, range manager of the site said.

""Our facility will have sporting clays, archery and some of the rifle, pistol things as well.""

755,Admitted sex offender stalker indicted for murder,"MILTON — Rocky Ali Beamon, an already twice convicted murderer who claims he has a duty to kill sex offenders, has been indicted by a Santa Rosa County grand jury for the first degree premeditated murder of fellow inmate Nicholas Anderson.

The Santa Rosa indictment, announced Thursday in a news release issued by the First Judicial Circuit State Attorney’s Office, clears the way for prosecutors to seek a second death penalty sentence.

Beamon was sentenced to die Jan. 28 for killing a fellow inmate in 2012 at Apalachee Correctional Institution in Jackson County. He had pleaded guilty to the crime and waived his right to trial.

Beamon’s victim in the 2012 homicide was Brian Hunsicker, a registered sex offender. Beamon stalked Hunsicker for days before the victim was choked and stabbed more than 80 times with a homemade shank in the shower of the prison dormitory, reports said.

Anderson, who was serving time on a child molestation charge, was Beamon’s cellmate at the Santa Rosa Correctional Institution in 2017 when he was killed. He was found bound and strangled, his neck cut with a homemade weapon, the news release said.

At the time of the Hunsucker murder, Beamon was serving a life sentence for the 2005 killing of a woman from whom he had purchased drugs.

In May of 2018, Beamon wrote a letter to a Judge Christopher Patterson in the 14th Judicial Circuit. He claimed killing sex offenders “was the best feeling I’ve had in a long time” and pledged to continue doing so if he was not sentenced to death.

“I’ll do my best to eliminate every single one until one of three things happens: (1) someone kills me, (2) I run out of people to kill, or (3) they put me where I can kill no more, death row,” the letter said.

In the letter, Beamon told Patterson “if you don’t send me to death row, I vow to dedicate my next (killing) to you.”

Beamon is presently being held at the Florida State Prison under close management in a single-man cell, according to the Florida Department of Corrections.

If Beamon is convicted of first degree murder in the 2017 case, the State Attorney's Office can either seek the death penalty or a life sentence. The news release issued Thursday said a decision on whether to seek the death penalty would be made within 30 days.",https://www.crestviewbulletin.com/news/20190502/admitted-sex-offender-stalker-indicted-for-murder?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T12:03:42Z,Crestview News Bulletin,"638 N Ferdon Blvd, Crestview, FL 32536, USA",FL,32536

Start preparing

Yes, America will get some form of Medicare for All in the near future. It is what the people want and need.

But, as with all major economic changes, there will be employee dislocation. We now have 35 insurance companies, with subsidiaries, employing about 2.6 million people. Not all are Americans. Some are H1-B visa workers. Some jobs are offshored to foreign countries. Of the remaining citizen employees some are doctors, nurses or various technical experts who could find jobs in other industries.

What will happen to the clerks, customer support or other people with only insurance-related skills? Some might be absorbed by the new Medicare department in local or national positions. The remainder should be retrained. There will be a growing need for health care administrators, X-ray and other technicians, nurses, etc. Retraining plans should be started now.

The funding could come out of insurance executive bonuses, to show that these people really care about their workers. Employees should see the writing on the wall and start preparing for their new futures.

No surprise

Have you heard the stories of people who get scammed by crafty criminals? One victim was convinced to send $50k to a scammer, claiming to be from Social Security, for the purpose of verifying their identity. Another victim sent gift cards to another scammer claiming to be from the IRS. Or, how about the scammer, claiming to be the victim’s grandson, who convinced her to wire thousands of dollars for bail to get him out of jail?

The “catfish” scammers are diabolical. They convince their victim, via chat room, that they are in love with each other. The “catfish” scammer is always stranded in a foreign country with no money to return home. So, who does he turn to for money? Of course, the poor lonely love of his life, who is only too happy to drain their bank account to help get the love of their life back home so they can marry.

It has been reported that scammers rake in billions of dollars annually by taking advantage of naive, impressionable people. So, why would it surprise anyone that a Trump could be elected president?

RIP, Havlicek

John Havlicek was the face of many of the Boston Celtics' signature moments. His defining traits as a player were his relentless hustle and wholehearted commitment to team over self.

He was extraordinarily thoughtful and generous, both on a personal level and for those in need, as illustrated by his commitment to raising money for The Genesis Foundation for Children over three decades through his fishing tournament.

He was kind and considerate, humble and gracious. He was a champion in every sense.

We will remember John Havlicek as a Boston Celtics legend always and forever.

Pretty fundamental

Joseph Biden is quoted in The News-Press recently as saying, ""But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.""

If Mr. Biden actually believes that Donald Trump or any president can accomplish this, he is dumber than I thought. By the way, whose party wants to ""fundamentally alter"" our character with ""free"" college, ""free"" health care, open borders, abortion at any time during pregnancy, even infanticide?

Elimination of the need for personal responsibility in our nation is pretty fundamental, isn't it?

759,Study: Nearly half of young women are behind on lifesaving screening,"May is Women’s Health Month.

A recent study shows a disturbing trend when it comes to screening for one of the most preventable cancers in young women.

Dr. Robert DeBernardo, of Cleveland Clinic, did not take part in the research, but said it shows that when it comes to cervical cancer screening, women in their 20s were most likely to miss important tests.

""What they found was if you asked the question, 'How many women that are between 21 and 29 have gotten Pap smear screening, according to the new guidelines?' And the answer is roughly half,"" he said.

The study looked at data on more than 47,000 women.

Researchers found that while 64.6% of women between the ages of 30 and 65 were up-to-date on their cervical cancer screening, women in their 20s were lagging behind at 53.8%.

The guidelines for women in their 20s call for more frequent screenings and change once a woman reaches age 30.

DeBernardo said screening is especially important for young women in their 20s because cervical cancer, when caught early, is very treatable.

He said one of the reasons for the discrepancy between age groups could be a result of the new guidelines being somewhat confusing for patients and health care providers.

DeBernardo said the bottom line is that it’s important for all women to see a doctor every year and take charge of their personal health.

""Women need to be empowered to understand that they’re responsible -- not just for their child or their husband or their parent or their sibling -- they’re responsible for their own health,"" he said.""And going to the doctor should be all that’s required. If you show up to your family physician or your gynecologist, you should get the adequate screening.""

DeBernardo recommends women ask their doctors for paper copies of all screening results, just in case of an unforeseen change in employment or insurance, so that they have their most recent health information in their hands.

Complete results of the study can be found in the Journal of Women’s Health.

760,4 deputies shoot man playing loud music at Sweetwater Country Club,"APOPKA, Fla. - Four deputies shot and critically wounded a man who they say pointed a gun at them during a confrontation early Wednesday at the Sweetwater Country Club near Apopka, officials said.

Orange County Sheriff John Mina said deputies were called to the home early Wednesday because loud music was coming from a home on Majestic Oak Drive.

Mina said a 49-year-old man, whose name has not been released, pointed a gun at deputies, who opened fire, striking him. The man was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center in critical condition.

The deputies were not hurt, Mina said.

A woman was in the home but did not witness the shooting, nor was she injured, according to Mina.

Mina said deputies were called to the same home twice in March because of loud music and a man who was drunk. Mina said the man was beligerent toward deputies during at least one of those calls.

The deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in law enforcement shootings.

Mina said his agency and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the shooting.

In a tweet, the Orange County Sheriff's Office asked people to avoid the area.

— A motorcyclist who lost control and crashed after allegedly flipping off a driver on a Texas highway is in critical condition, deputies said.

A woman and her child were in a Chevy Suburban making a left turn Sunday night on the North Eldridge Parkway in Cypress, just northwest of Houston, when the motorcyclist was revving his engine behind her, according to authorities.

The man, driving a black Harley-Davidson, passed the woman on her right and made an obscene gesture, KPRC reported. He then got in front of her vehicle and turned around and flipped her off a second time, but lost control and crashed.

NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Pasco County woman is facing charges after deputies say she assaulted a man in an attempt to sober him up.

Pasco deputies were called a home on Hummingbird Lane in New Port Richey just before 1 a.m. Sunday and arrested 39-year-old Amber Lynnee Grace.

According to an arrest report, Grace slapped the victim in the face during an argument inside the home. The victim told deputies he then walked away from Grace and went to his bedroom.

Deputies say the victim later woke up and found Grace standing over him with a kitchen knife raised above her head. Grace then stabbed the bed with the knife, the arrest report says.

The victim told deputies he was scared he was going to be stabbed by Grace. A responding deputy noted in the arrest report that there was a slice in the bedsheets just inches away from the pillow where the victim's head was.

771,Mother warns of pornographic images on popular video game,"ATLANTA - Because Roblox is one of the most popular video games among kids, one mother is warning other parents about pornographic images that showed up in her son's game.

The Georgia woman's 8-year-old son was playing Roblox when he saw images best suited for adults, according to WSB.

“I started recording the screen because I had never seen anything this inappropriate in a game,” the woman said. “He said, ‘Look mom, a p****.’ I’m, like, ‘A what?’ That’s when I immediately grabbed the phone from him.”

Roblox allows users to create their own online worlds, but all are allegedly monitored by the game developers. However, the woman said what she saw crossed the line.

“Male body parts, female body parts. They’re able to have intercourse with each other,” the mother said.

On its website, Roblox includes a parents guide where the company claims ""all uploaded images, video, and audio files are pre-reviewed by moderators before being allowed on the site.""

780,Daytona Beach Shores woman recalls childhood escape from Nazi Germany,"Beatrice Deutsch and her sister begged their mother to awaken them in time to see the Statue of Liberty as their ship entered New York Harbor.

But it was dark as they approached the port in the early hours of that March 1939 morning, and Bea’s mother let the girls sleep.

“(I wanted to see it) for the whole rest of my life,” said Bea, 85, of Daytona Beach Shores. “I’ve seen the Statue of Liberty from different places in New York, but I never saw it as an immigrant coming in.”

Bea and her family were Jewish refugees from Cronheim, Germany, a small Bavarian town about 100 miles northwest of Munich.

Her father, a Jewish spiritual leader, provided rabbinical services and slaughtered chickens and cattle for the Orthodox community’s kosher consumption.

Bea was born in her parents’ synagogue-attached apartment in 1933, the year Adolf Hitler came to power.

“There were lots of people in Germany that didn't think (Nazi ideology) was going anywhere. They thought Hitler was just a nut,” said Bea, whose surname is now Schemer. But her father wasn’t one of them. “He knew that he needed to take his family off of the European continent.”

Bea’s family sought asylum in South America in 1937, and gained entrance to the U.S. two years later. But before they left Germany, Bea got a taste of the roiling hatred that later would turn into full-fledged genocide.

“We all read about the history of the Holocaust and all of that, but individual experiences like (my family’s) need to be told,” Bea said.

She was only 2 in 1935 when Nazi Germany’s Nuremberg Laws institutionalized anti-Semitism, but she recalls the aftermath clearly.

As a toddler, she watched bright orange flames devour a neighbor’s home from the upstairs window of her family’s apartment. Firefighters blew trumpets in the street below, but they weren’t raising an alarm — they were celebrating.

“They were dancing in front of this burning house, not making any effort whatsoever to put it out,” Bea said. “Because the house was the house of Jews.”

Cronheim was known for the harmonious relationships between Jews, Catholics and Lutherans. But the Nuremberg Laws drove a wedge between Jews and their fellow citizens.

Vandals shattered three of the synagogue’s ground-to-ceiling stained glass windows while Bea’s family was home on the Sabbath.

Other threats were more direct.

“My sister and I would be outside playing and we would get attacked by the neighborhood boys,” Bea said.

One boy hurled a rock that struck her sister in the temple. “She bore a scar of that for the rest of her life.”

The Nazis targeted Jewish traditions — kosher meat was outlawed, and Jews could no longer conduct business with non-Jewish Germans.

But not everyone complied with the Nazi agenda.

A local farmer’s wife risked arrest to hide butter, milk and eggs under the stairs outside Bea’s home in the middle of the night so that her family would have something to eat.

In 1936, the Nazis notified Bea’s father that deportation was imminent.

Her mother’s German heritage dated back to the 1700s, but her father’s family had emigrated from Hungary when he was a child. The Nazis intended to send him back.

He immediately began applying for asylum and eventually was granted passage to Cali, Colombia.

In the event that he was deported before his family could set sail from Germany, he planned for Bea, her mother and sister to go live with Bea’s maternal grandparents in Amsterdam.

“I wouldn't be sitting here telling this story if we had wound up going with them,” Bea said. The Nazis invaded the Netherlands in 1940, and her mother’s relatives there were all sent to Sobibor death camp in Poland and exterminated.

Bea’s family boarded a ship from Hamburg to Colombia in April 1937. When they reached their cabin, they found the contents of their suitcases scattered across the floor. Two Nazi soldiers sifted through their belongings.

Jews weren’t allowed to take any valuables out of Germany, so Bea’s mother had sewn their family jewelry into the lining of her clothes.

“You could imagine how terrified she had to have been that they might find that,” Bea said. But they didn’t, and the soldiers left empty-handed.

Her father brought along his 177-volume rabbinical library to prevent Nazis from burning them.

About 50 Jews lived in Cali when Bea’s family arrived. Her father organized a synagogue, and by the time they left for New York two years later, the community had grown to about 300 Jewish refugees.

Bea’s family stayed in New York for six months, and then moved south to Jacksonville, where her mother’s brother taught in a local synagogue.

The war and the plight of their European relatives were ever-present worries.

They received letters from loved ones back home, but Nazis monitored and redacted the mail so details were scant.

News of Germany’s defeat came on Bea’s 12th birthday — May 7, 1945. But anti-Semitism didn’t just disappear.

Children yelled epithets at Bea and her sister, who was two years older, when they went outside to play. Her parents covered their windows during Jewish festival celebrations so the neighbors couldn’t see them lighting religious candles.

As a young adult, Bea was hired for a bank job — and then the manager began questioning her heritage.

“He said to me, ‘I’m sorry, but this bank does not hire Jews,” she recalled.

Despite those setbacks, Bea is a “very patriotic, proud American,” she said. “These are small incidents that occurred, but for the most part the United States of America saved my life.”

Bea has two daughters, and passed down to them the jewelry her mother smuggled from Germany. She also has one grandson.

She donated her late father’s rabbinical library to the University of Florida. The tomes are housed in the Rare Book Room of the Smathers Library Judaica Suite.

And in 2004, she finally captured the experience that eluded her as a young girl.

She went to New York City and took a boat tour to Liberty Island.

“I stood there and saw the Statue of Liberty as if I were coming in as an immigrant,” Bea said. “I will always remember how important that was to me.""

'Never forget'

The Holocaust survivors’ rallying cry has long been “never forget.”

As the youngest survivors age into their 70s, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., makes a special effort to preserve firsthand accounts in order to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike.

To honor this week's Days of Remembrance, established by Congress as the nation’s annual Holocaust commemoration, The News-Journal is sharing the individual accounts of four local Holocaust survivors.

Aimee Rubensteen, the museum's acquisitions coordinator, travels South Florida “rescuing the evidence of the Holocaust by speaking to firsthand witnesses,” she said, and collecting their World War II-era photos, letters, newspaper clippings, clothing and other artifacts of historical value.

“These original artifacts will be the things that teach the Holocaust to future generations,” Rubensteen said.

The museum’s mission is to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike and to encourage critical thinking about how and why those atrocities occurred.

Firsthand stories make those larger themes more personal.

“A lot of people don’t know about these specific, individual stories. The more we spread the word and expand the conversation, the better it is for everyone,” Rubensteen said.

Individuals or families who are interested in sharing their Holocaust artifacts or family keepsakes with the museum may contact Rubensteen at 786-496-2788 or arubensteen@ushmm.org to schedule an appointment.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190502/daytona-beach-shores-woman-recalls-childhood-escape-from-nazi-germany?rssfeed=true,2019-05-02T07:13:16Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
781,2 Philadelphia police officers arrested following domestic dispute in Indian Rocks Beach,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Cindy Caine and Frank Bonett)

INDIAN ROCKS BEACH, Fla. (WFLA) – Three people, including two off-duty Philadelphia police officers, were arrested following a domestic dispute and scuffle with a Pinellas deputy in Indian Rocks Beach on Tuesday.

Deputies were dispatched to the Crabby Bill’s restaurant on Gulf Boulevard after a complaint of a domestic battery that occurred at the business.

When deputies arrived, a witness said a man, later identified as Paul Seeger, 55, pushed a woman, identified as Cindy Caine, 44.

The deputy could see Seeger and Caine arguing near the intersection of 4th Avenue and 1st Street.

The couple walked away from the deputy and he approached them and called out.

Deputies said Seeger refused to stop and continued walking away after being given multiple warnings to stop.

The deputy grabbed Seeger’s arm and he resisted. Caine pushed the deputy’s arm away.

While trying to stop Seeger, a third man, Frank Bonett, 44, approached the deputy and started making threats.

Bonett removed his shirt, clinched his fists and shouted profanities at the deputy, advancing at him after being told numerous times to stay away.

Deputies said Seeger and Bonett approached the deputy in a hostile manner.

The deputy deployed his Taser at Seeger, but it was ineffective.

The deputy took down Seeger to the ground and a violent struggle ensued.

Seeger was eventually handcuff and taken into custody.

Bonett and Caine were also taken into custody.

Caine and Seeger are husband and wife. They were both uncooperative with the investigation.

After years of deaths in Florida's cosmetic surgery clinics, state lawmakers approved sweeping legislation Wednesday that calls for some of the nation's strictest controls of the industry.

If signed by the governor, the new law would allow the state for the first time to punish dangerous plastic surgery facilities and shut down the worst offenders.

The legislation passed after years of no regulation in Florida, where private investors opened high-volume, discount clinics that became magnets for women seeking cosmetic procedures.

""It's been long overdue,"" said Crystal Call, 34, of New York, whose mother found her in a locked recovery room nearly bleeding to death after her surgery in Miami. ""[It's] sad that so many people had to die or have serious injuries to do so.""

The effort to toughen the law began two months ago after an investigation by USA TODAY and the Naples Daily News that showed eight women died after procedures at a plastic surgery business owned by one doctor.

In April, a second story revealed the state tried unsuccessfully to pass legislation four times that would have cracked down on the centers, even as felony offenders opened their own facilities with no background screening by the state.

In those businesses, at least 13 women died after cosmetic surgeries and nearly a dozen others were critically injured, including two hospitalized in septic shock.

The majority of the patients who lost their lives were African American or Hispanic women – ethnic groups singled out in the clinics' advertising blitzes.

State Sen. Anitere Flores, a Miami Republican who led the drive, said it was time to close a dangerous loophole that allowed the state to regulate doctors who owned clinics but not the private entrepreneurs who began opening facilities more than a decade ago.

“People are dying and being horribly disfigured,” she told Senate colleagues before their vote on the bill. “We are going to take a step to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.""

The House finalized the legislation Wednesday, passing it unanimously. It heads to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis for his signature.

The legislation, which would take effect in January, would give the state the power to suspend a clinic's operations or even revoke its registration if the state found the facility posed an imminent threat to the public.

Floridians deserve better. Ensuring these centers are licensed, safe & liable when something goes wrong. I’m filing legislation this session to protect Floridians & those who visit from danger from these pop-up cosmetic surgery centers. #Session2019https://t.co/P8XmmoqN8d — Sen. Anitere Flores (@anitere_flores) January 31, 2019

Each clinic owner would have to appoint a doctor to ensure a facility was safe for patients – a role now filled by anyone in charge of the center. If a surgery office was shut down, the state could ban the owner and the doctors from working in another center for five years.

The legislation is the most successful effort to regulate surgery centers since the late 1990s, when plastic surgery was a cottage industry in Florida dominated by traditional clinics and board-certified practitioners.

Shelia Powell, 35, a Mississippi mother of twin daughters whose lung was punctured during her tummy tuck surgery last year, said the measures could save lives.

""Lots of people came there and died there,"" Powell said. ""It was like they could do whatever they wanted to do, and there were no consequences.""

For patients who are injured, the regulations would require all clinics to carry at least $250,000 in malpractice coverage.

Patients have had to fend for themselves, at times losing their jobs and getting buried in medical debts, said Andres Beregovich, an Orlando lawyer who investigated the clinics on behalf of patients.

""How is that fair?"" he asked.

Beregovich said his main concern with the new legislation is whether the state will require the clinics to show health authorities proof of that coverage.

Patient advocates applauded the changes but were harshly critical of the loss of one protection during negotiations over the bill: a requirement to screen owners for criminal records.

The background checks were pulled off the table after the Agency for Health Care Administration raised concerns about the costs, including the possibility of having to pay for seven new staff positions, records show.

Former state Sen. Eleanor Sobel, who tried unsuccessfully three times to get legislation passed, said removing the requirement was ""crazy,"" citing USA TODAY's story exposing the state for allowing four people with felony convictions to open businesses where patients died.

Dave Aronberg, Palm Beach County's state attorney, questioned whether the state would have needed to hire seven new people.

""It just seems like an inflated number,"" he said. ""The fact that [the background checks] are not being done because they are too expensive is not a legitimate reason to jeopardize public health.""

Flores acknowledged she and other supporters of the bill had to strike some compromises. But she said the core of the plan remains, giving the state ""the tools"" to shut down problem centers.

Seven other states and the District of Columbia have laws that permit health departments to crack down on cosmetic surgery facilities with sanctions including suspensions and fines, according to the Policy Surveillance Program at Temple University.

Flores said that among the things that most disturbed her was that, even after highly publicized death cases, clinic owners remained open by simply removing a troubled doctor and substituting another dangerous surgeon.

""In these cases where someone dies in a clinic, the place will simply shut down for 24 hours and open up the next day,"" Flores said. ""Not a big deal, not a problem.""

Many doctors working in the clinics were not adequately trained in plastic surgery or had been disciplined by medical boards for charges including unethical conduct and malpractice in death cases, USA TODAY found.

During an impassioned speech last week to the Senate, Flores reminded her colleagues that the women traveling to Miami for their surgeries were not only from Florida.

“This is not a Miami problem. It’s not a South Florida problem. It’s a national problem,” she said. “There was a young woman from West Virginia. Her name was Heather Meadows, 29 years old, left behind two children. And her kids are never going to see her again because, quite frankly, we dropped the ball.”

Since filing her bill in February, Flores said she has been contacted by parents who lost their adult children and doctors who treated patients who suffered injuries in the cosmetic clinics.

“If there is a silver lining in there, it is that your family member’s … death was not in vain,” she said. “It was because of that tragedy, today we’re going to take a step to make sure that doesn’t have to happen to anybody else.”

783,Cape Coral man charged with threatening judges; Facebook posts stemmed from custody issue,"CLOSE Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno addresses members of the media Tuesday, April 30, 2019 in Cape Coral in regards to an ongoing threat investigation. Ricardo Rolon, Fort Myers News-Press

A Cape Coral man charged with multiple offenses after he posted on Facebook that Lee County judges should die and led deputies on a chase that ended in his arrest remains in Lee County jail on $465,000 bond.

William Daniel Seyfried, 43, now faces seven charges including aggravated assault on an officer, threatening a judge with death or serious harm, threatening to discharge a destructive device, make or attempting to make a destructive device, fleeing and eluding law enforcement and threaten with death or serious bodily harm.

Seyfried made his first appearance in Lee County Court on Wednesday and will be arraigned June 3.

A report from the Lee County Sheriff's Office said an investigation began Monday into Seyfried's Facebook remarks with several posts and videos showing him with a semi-automatic rifle and a discussion of components used to build explosives.

One post showed a blue container and the description ""FILLED WITH DIESEL STUMP REMOVER A SPARK PLUG AND A LONG (EXPLETIVE) WIRE"".

Seyfried's Facebook comments stemmed from a child custody issue. He also has a past arrest and numerous charges including battery, kidnapping and resisting arrest. Court documents showed several domestic violence cases between him and his wife, Lysanda Seyfried, in September and October.

Lysanda Seyfried is listed as owner of the Northwest 15th Terrace home in Cape Coral.

Initial contact by deputies with Seyfried at Northwest 15th Terrace resulted in him yelling at deputies that they were trespassing and should leave, the report said.

The report said Seyfried armed himself with a bow and arrow, a baseball bat and a machete and broadcast a Facebook Live video saying he was ""going invisible."" The Sheriff's Office report said deputies thought Seyfried might try to detonate an explosive device.

Seyfried was able to leave his home and deputies gave chase, colliding with his vehicle but failing to contain him. Seyfried left the collision area.

A woman claiming to be Seyfried's sister reported to the Sheriff's Office that he was parked next to her home. The report said deputies and Cape Coral police units then began pursuing Seyfried again eventually stopping him using the PIT maneuver, a pursuit tactic police use to force a fleeing car to turn sideways abruptly, causing the driver to lose control and stop.

Deputies broke Seyfried's driver's window to get him from the vehicle and shot him with a Taser to arrest him. Deputies found the bow and arrow and a large tactical knife in his vehicle.

A relative of Seyfried told deputies he claimed to have a live grenade. A search of the 1113 NW 15th address found several ""items of interest,"" Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said.

786,How a violent confrontation led to a military veteran's death,"HOMESTEAD, Fla. - It was a story that shocked a South Florida community last year: An elderly military veteran with a gun was shot down by police in a hail of bullets.

New body camera video given to Local 10 News showed how and why it happened, and how possible discrimination by the man's apartment complex could have contributed to his death.

""For the love of God, man, please put your hands up!"" an officer can be heard shouting in exclusive body camera video obtained by Local 10 News.

The video details the desperate standoff between Miami-Dade police officers and 84-year-old Raymond Bishop. Bishop, a disabled military veteran, was threatening to shoot himself inside his apartment.

""I do not want to hurt you,"" said one officer. ""Sir you are a veteran. You are a hero to us. Please do not do this!""

The video is from February 2018, after a 911 call from Bishop's social worker Jaye Harkow with the Department of Veteran Affairs, brought officers to the Hidden Grove apartments near Homestead.



""He is a veteran. He has a disability of a visual problem,"" Harkow said on the call. ""I would say he's grossly depressed because the apartment where he is living is evicting him. He told me he was going to kill his two dogs and himself.""

The situation ended tragically when Bishop refused to drop his weapon and instead raised the handgun. Officers shot him six times, killing him.

The reason for the confrontation was an ongoing legal battle with management at Hidden Grove, who were trying to evict him over his two service and emotional support dogs.

""It ended horribly and it was unnecessary,"" said attorney Matthew Dietz of the Disability Independence Group, who is representing Bishop's family in the ongoing eviction case.

Court documents show Bishop suffered from multiple disabilities, including a loss of vision and mood disorders. The complex started trying to kick him out in July 2017, after one of his two small dogs was off leash and nearly bit a resident. But neighbors said the woman was fine and didn't want to take any action.

""The girl withdrew her charges,"" one neighbor who did not want to be identified told Local 10's Amy Viteri. ""But they (management) continued, because they wanted the apartment, period.""

Bishop went to his doctors at the VA, who provided letters saying his two dogs -- Ranger, who is 10 years old and blind, and Roxie, who is deaf with a deformed leg -- were essential to his well-being. Dietz said the property manager, Roxanna Sanchez, first refused to see Bishop and then ignored his letters.

""This is one of the largest management companies in the state of Florida,"" Dietz said. ""They're trained in the Fair Housing Act.""

Shortly before the shooting, management told Bishop that, regardless of what happened with the eviction case, they would not be renewing his lease when it was up at the end of the month. Bishop believed he and the dogs would have nowhere to go.

In her 911 call, Harkow said, ""We are having a very hard time finding him accommodations that will take care of the dogs.""

Bishop left a suicide note addressing the housing dilemma: ""I am incapable of keeping myself and my very precious friends, Ranger & Roxie in reasonable comfort and good health…There being no place that we three…can go together.""

""For Mr. Bishop, these dogs were his medication. They were his reason for living and waking up in the morning and when he thought he couldn't have them anymore, he killed himself -- technically, by using the police,"" Dietz said.

Crime scene photos showed one of the dogs hiding in the bed after the shooting. Both dogs have been living with a friend of Bishop's since the shooting.

Management at Hidden Grove had nothing to say when asked about the eviction.

Bishop's granddaughter Ashley Huntsberry-Lett spoke with Viteri from Virginia via Skype.

""It's not right to treat people that way,"" she said.

Huntsberry-Lett said management bullied her fragile grandfather to his breaking point.

""I feel that they're 100% culpable,"" she said. ""He was a disabled man who had nowhere else to go.""

Dietz said the complex had an obligation to try to address the concern before evicting Bishop and had an opportunity to show compassion.

""They know about what emotional support animals are,"" he said. ""And they knew what to do in this situation and they chose not to. And that's why Mr. Bishop is dead.""

Bishop's family also said his computers and televisions, which were visible in police photos, were missing from his apartment when management finally allowed relatives to enter.

An attorney representing Hidden Grove has not returned calls regarding this story.

788,Florida deputy fired after off-duty fight at Jacksonville hotel,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Brevard County Sheriff's Office deputy was fired after being involved in an altercation while off duty in February at a Jacksonville hotel.

According to an internal affairs report from the Sheriff's Office that was obtained by News4Jax on Tuesday, then-Deputy Jason Allen Roberts and his fiancée were staying at the Lexington Hotel on Jacksonville's Southbank. The report said they met an unnamed man who was also staying there and all three drank into the night before returning to their rooms about 4:30 a.m. March 17. The report said Roberts got mad when his fiancée went into the other man's bathroom and he started banging and kicking the door, breaking it. The other man tried to defuse the situation, according to the report, but Roberts punched him in the face, knocking out a tooth. The fiancée came out of the bathroom, Roberts pinned her to the floor, the other man again tried to intervene and Roberts knocked him down to the floor and pinned him, the report said. That’s when the other man pulled a gun from his pocket and shot Roberts, according to the report. The Sheriff's Office said he was injured in the shooting.

The state attorney’s office called it self-defense. The state attorney's office considered charging Roberts with battery, but did not. He was fired.

The man who shot him was questioned and released. He was not charged.

According to the Sheriff's Office, Roberts had been disciplined a number of times, dating back to 2011, including for an unsafe pursuit, failing to respond to a text alert about a shooting, being intoxicated and unprofessional toward first responders while off duty, missing a deposition in a case that led to charges being dropped and not filing a response-to-resistance report after he injured a woman while making a prostitution arrest.

SMITHFIELD, N.C. (WNCN) - A 65-year-old man living on the streets of Bradenton has been arrested in the 1972 murder of a woman at a Johnston County, North Carolina migrant camp, Sheriff Steve Bizzell announced Tuesday.

Bonnie Neighbors was killed Dec. 14, 1972 while she held her son in her arms, Bizzell said.

Her body was found Dec. 17, 1972 bound and shot twice at a migrant camp with her son still alive next to her body.

Larry Joe Scott, 65, who at one time lived in Benson, has been charged with first-degree murder in Neighbors' death, Bizzell said.

Scott was living on the streets of Bradenton, Florida at the time of his arrest.

Scott is being held in Florida as he awaits extradition.

""Justice has been far too delayed,"" Bizzell said.

The sheriff said he was able to look at Neighbor's son in the eyes and tell him his mother's killer had been arrested.

""We have found your mother's murderer,"" Bizzell told the son.

Bizzell said Scott did not know Neighbors at the time of the murder.

Bizzell reopened case in 2007 and despite Scott's arrest, the investigation is ongoing.

DNA was used to identify Scott as the suspect.

Attorney General Josh Stein said District Attorney Susan Doyle never gave up in her pursuit of justice in Neighbors' murder.

""For 47 years many thought this day would never come. but this day has come,"" Doyle said.

Stein pointed out the importance of DNA testing to help solve cold cases.

792,"Almost 6 months after stroke, my only option is to keep going","CLOSE Christina LaFortune chats with FLORIDA TODAY executive editor (retired) Bob Gabordi about his career and life on the Space Coast Rob Landers, FLORIDA TODAY

Editor's note: Former FLORIDA TODAY Executive Editor Bob Gabordi suffered a stroke Nov. 9 while at work. His stroke resulted from atrial fibrillation. AFib causes an irregular heartbeat during which the upper heart beats too quickly, which can cause clotting. For more, visit strokeassociation.org/strokeorg. Gabordi retired in March. This is his first post-retirement column as he writes about his experience.

The woman in the MRI lab recognized me. After all, the last time she saw me was the night I almost died.

“It was quite a night,” she said at least three times as she handed me some papers to sign.

“So I’m told,” I muttered or mumbled or something like that. In truth I have no memory of that night at the Viera Hospital, or the tube that was stuck in me to take over breathing when my body quit. Maybe it’s better that my brain has blocked out that memory.

I did recognize the woman, though. Vaguely — you know how you think you know someone but not enough to say anything because you might be wrong? After all, as she said, that was quite a night.

At lot has happened since then. Too much to put into a single column, maybe too much for my brain to comprehend. My brain is fully functioning. I bring what I’ve always brought, brainwise.

I retired March 1 after more than 40 years in journalism, but I’m not in love with it.

Oh, don’t get me wrong. I do love hanging out more with my wife Donna and daughter Jessica. And I do love the extra time I’ve gotten to spend with my grandchildren and their parents. But I feel I should be … well, I’m not sure what, but I should be, I know that.

I applied for a job and was one of two finalists in what I’m told was a crowded starting field. I would have loved that job. It met all the criteria I set. But I didn’t get picked. It hurt, of course; I’m not used to losing.

I’ll find something else, I know, that will get me back in the game.

And we’ve overcome other setbacks.

Like walking. Sometimes you just have to pick up your feet and put them back down while pushing yourself forward. I remember struggling even with the help of a walker and people on either side of me to help hold me up to make it to the nurses’ station.

“Hi, nurses,” I said that day. I felt I had conquered the world, even though I had gone maybe 10 or 15 feet.

The other morning was one of those beautiful days when low tide and hard sand coincide with a brilliant sunrise on the beach. I walked 3.6 miles. And I’m closing in on 140 miles since Jan. 1. Talk about a good sign: I had to make a trip to Running Zone for new shoes. My toes were popping through the old ones.

One foot after the other. One at a time. Just keep moving forward. Always forward.

I’m regaining strength and muscle, and I’m still losing weight: more than 35 pounds since the stroke Nov. 9. My blood pressure, cholesterol and heart rate would look good on any teenager. I’m healthy and getting more so by the day.

There remain challenges, including the big one: swallowing, my last major obstacle. Since I last wrote about my recovery, I’ve been able to swallow water. It’s hard work, but it happens. The modified barium swallow study showed water went down my throat. Nothing more substantial yet, but the muscles worked, kind of, and my hope it that through therapy and hard work, I’ll more completely regain that function, too.

Right now, it is kind of a trickle, but the hope is we’ll retrain the muscles, strengthen them and eventually I’ll eat again. Until then, I take in nutrition through a tube. But I’m still battling.

Don’t bet against me. Don’t tell me it’s iffy. Don’t paint worst-case scenarios for me. I’ve had therapists and others do that and I don’t want to hear it. I’ve never had any place in my life for negative thinkers. Since I left the hospital in December, some people have been waiting for me to fall. It hasn’t happened, despite my lack of coordination at times.

But it could happen. I might fall at some point.

Guess what. If it does, I promise I’ll get back up and keep going, because that is all I know how to do.

793,"FHP: Driver flees traffic stop, drags Nassau County deputy","NASSAU COUNTY, Fla. - A driver who was pulled over for a traffic stop fled from a deputy, dragging him along for a short distance, troopers said.

Florida Highway Patrol officials said Deputy G. Holton was dragged by the driver of a Hyundai. He was not injured.

Holton quickly got into his marked police vehicle and pursued Westhouse on Fletcher Avenue, and Deputy W. Quick began to assist Holton in a marked vehicle, as well, the FHP said.

Officials said Westhouse made an abrupt turn through the A1A Express parking lot, where a citizen who was standing on the shoulder began flagging down the deputies.

Both deputies reported that they attempted to stop to avoid crashing or hitting the citizen, but Holton’s vehicle crashed into the left side of Quick's, then crossed the southbound lane and struck a Chrysler 200, which was stopped on the side of the road.

The driver of the Chrysler, a 62-year-old woman, had minor injuries as a result, FHP said. It's unclear what happened to the driver of the Hyundai.

795,Vigil held in Mandarin in wake of California synagogue shooting,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - People in Jacksonville gathered at a vigil Monday night at a Mandarin synagogue and said prayers for the Jewish community.

The vigil was held after a woman was shot to death in a Southern California synagogue this past weekend.

Authorities said a gunman on Saturday burst into the Chabad of Poway near San Diego on the last day of Passover, a major Jewish holiday that celebrates freedom, and opened fire with an assault-style rifle, killing 60-year-old Lori Kaye and wounding a rabbi and two others.

797,Nike post shows woman with underarm hair; internet still reeling,"Nigerian-American singer Annahstasia slung her arm over her head and said, “snap the picture” -- probably.

That’s what we’ll assume, considering her power pose!

Annahstasia is modeling a black Nike sports bra, and she looks confident, strong and assertive. Nike posted the photo on its @nikewomen account last week.

But words like “confident” aren’t exactly the kind of comments you’ll find if you scroll through the Instagram post -- well, at least not right away. You’ll probably stumble across the vomit emojis first. It seems as though people are shocked by a woman’s capacity to grow, or show, some body hair.

“No thanks,” one commenter wrote, which garnered more than 400 positive reactions.

Another said, “Horrible PR move. Less than 1% of your female target market doesn’t shave.”

“She needs a shave,” another commenter said.

And those are some examples that don’t use profanity.

Others applauded Nike’s decision to use the photo.

“This photo is beautiful on so many different levels,” one person wrote.

“It’s an active human body,” another responded. “Let her be. It’s nature. What’s the problem?”

Added another commenter, “Thank you, Nike, for your support of being natural.”

At last check, the post had racked up more than 8,000 comments. There isn’t much gray area: People either love the post or seem to hate it.

The comments have transformed into a conversation about beauty standards.

Let it be known that Annahstasia and Nike aren’t exactly the first people to come out strong in 2019, showing some underarm hair.

Paris Jackson and “Bachelor” star Bekah Martinez are among those in the public eye who’ve been open, showing off their own body hair. Sure, they’re not exactly A-listers, but they’ve cultivated a following, and they’re expanding the conversation.

Admittedly, it’s not every day that you see a model shown off on a major brand’s social media page, proudly displaying her underarm hair with no further explanation.

But on the other hand, it’s really not very much. It’s just natural, right?

803,Florida lawmakers OK sweeping reforms to crack down on deadly cosmetic surgery facilities,"Nicola Mason, 46, a Maryland mother of two, was left badly scarred from a botched surgery at one of the more troubled cosmetic surgery centers in Miami. (Photo: Jarrad Henderson, USAT)

After years of rampant deaths in Florida's cosmetic surgery clinics, state lawmakers approved sweeping legislation that calls for some of the nation's strictest controls of the industry.

If signed by the governor, the new law will allow the state for the first time to punish dangerous plastic surgery facilities and shut down the worst offenders.

The legislation passed on Wednesday comes after years of no regulation in Florida, where private investors opened high-volume, discount clinics that became magnets for women seeking cosmetic procedures.

""It's been long overdue,"" said Crystal Call, 34, of New York, whose mother found her in a locked recovery room nearly bleeding to death after her surgery in Miami. ""[It's] sad that so many people had to die or have serious injuries to do so.""

The effort to toughen the law began two months ago following an investigation by USA TODAY and the Naples Daily News that showed eight women died after procedures at a plastic surgery business owned by one doctor.

In April, a second story revealed the state tried unsuccessfully to pass legislation four times that would have cracked down on the centers, even as felony offenders opened their own facilities with no background screening by the state.

In those businesses, at least 13 women died after cosmetic surgeries and nearly a dozen others were critically injured, including two hospitalized in septic shock.

The majority of the patients who lost their lives were African-American or Hispanic women – ethnic groups singled out in the clinics' advertising blitzes.

Anitere Flores, a Miami senate Republican who led the drive, said it was time to close a dangerous loophole that allowed the state to regulate doctors who owned clinics, but not the private entrepreneurs who began opening facilities more than a decade ago.

“People are dying and being horribly disfigured,” she told Senate colleagues before their vote on the bill. “We are going to take a step to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.""

The House finalized the legislation on Wednesday, passing it unanimously. It now heads to Gov. Ron DeSantis for his signature.

The new legislation, which takes effect in January, will give the state the power to suspend a clinic's operations or even revoke its registration if the state finds the facility poses an imminent threat to the public.

Floridians deserve better. Ensuring these centers are licensed, safe & liable when something goes wrong. I’m filing legislation this session to protect Floridians & those who visit from danger from these pop-up cosmetic surgery centers. #Session2019https://t.co/P8XmmoqN8d — Sen. Anitere Flores (@anitere_flores) January 31, 2019

Each clinic owner must appoint a doctor as the key person in charge to ensure a facility is safe for patients – a role now filled by anyone in charge of the center. If a surgery office is shut down, the state can ban the owner and the doctors from working in another center for five years.

The reforms represent the first successful effort to regulate surgery centers since the late 1990s, when plastic surgery was still a cottage industry in Florida dominated by traditional clinics and board-certified practitioners.

Shelia Powell, 35, a Mississippi mother of twin daughters whose lung was punctured during her tummy tuck surgery last year said the measures could save lives.

""Lots of people came there and died there,"" Powell said. ""It was like they could do whatever they wanted to do and there were no consequences.""

For patients who are injured, the new regulations require all clinics to carry at least $250,000 in malpractice coverage.

CLOSE Eight women died after operations at a Miami plastic surgery business, some after doctors botched procedures, a USA TODAY Network investigation found. USA TODAY

Up until now, patients had to fend for themselves, at times losing their jobs and getting buried in medical debts, said Andres Beregovich, an Orlando lawyer who has investigated the clinics on behalf of patients.

""How is that fair?"" he asked.

Beregovich said his main concern with the new legislation is whether the state will require the clinics to show health authorities proof of that coverage.

Patient advocates applauded the reforms but were harshly critical of the loss of one protection during negotiations over the bill: a requirement to screen owners for criminal records.

The background checks were pulled off the table after the Agency for Healthcare Administration raised concerns about the costs, including the possibility of having to pay for seven new staff positions, records show.

Former Sen. Eleanor Sobel, who tried unsuccessfully three times to get legislation passed, said removing the requirement was ""crazy,"" citing USA TODAY's story exposing the state for allowing four people with felony convictions to open businesses where patients died.

Dave Aronberg, Palm Beach County's state attorney, questioned whether the state really would have needed to hire seven new people.

""It just seems like an inflated number,"" he said. ""The fact that [the background checks] are not being done because they are too expensive is not a legitimate reason to jeopardize public health.""

Flores acknowledged she and other supporters of the bill had to strike some compromises. But she said the core of the plan remains, giving the state ""the tools"" to shut down problem centers.

Currently, only seven other states and the District of Columbia have laws that permit health departments to crack down on cosmetic surgery facilities with sanctions including suspensions and fines, according to the Policy Surveillance Program at Temple University.

Flores said among the things that has most disturbed her was that, even after highly publicized death cases, clinic owners remained open by simply removing a troubled doctor and replacing them with another dangerous surgeon.

The ""most frustrating is that in these cases where someone dies in a clinic the place will simply shut down for 24 hours and open up the next day,"" said Flores. ""Not a big deal, not a problem.""

Many doctors working in the clinics were not adequately trained in plastic surgery or had been previously disciplined by medical boards for charges including unethical conduct and malpractice in death cases, USA TODAY found.

During an impassioned speech last week to the Senate, Flores reminded her colleagues that the women traveling to Miami for their surgeries were not only from Florida.

“This is not a Miami problem. It’s not a South Florida problem. It’s a national problem,” she said. “There was a young woman from West Virginia. Her name was Heather Meadows. Twenty-nine years old. Left behind two children. And her kids are never going to see her again because, quite frankly, we dropped the ball.”

Since filing her bill in February, Flores said she has been contacted by parents who lost their adult children and doctors who treated patients who suffered injuries in the cosmetic clinics.

“If there is a silver lining in there, it is that your family member’s…death was not in vain,” she said. “It was because of that tragedy, today we’re going to take a step to make sure that doesn’t have to happen to anybody else.”

808,Riverside shooting stirs debate over domestic violence,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The shooting death of a man in Riverside has sparked debate over domestic violence and the court orders that are supposed to protect victims from it.

Shane Dyson, 36, was shot about 6 p.m. Sunday at a home near College and King streets. He was taken to a hospital, but he later died of his injuries.

So far, no one has been charged in the shooting. Based on information gleaned from police reports it's unclear who investigators suspect pulled the trigger.

RELATED: Mother says woman acted in self-defense when ex-fiance was killed

But News4Jax has been in touch with the mother of Dyson's ex-fiancee, Jennifer Mathis. She told News4Jax that Mathis acted in self-defense.

Mathis, who shared a child with Dyson, had filed a restraining order on him in the past. We discovered she was one of three women, including Mathis' mother, who have filed injunctions against him.

Corrections records show Dyson served eight years in prison for convictions for home invasion and cocaine possession and was released in 2013.

After posting this story to the News4jax Facebook page, multiple women sounded off in support of Mathis (who police have not identified as the shooter). News4Jax reached out to the Glynn County Community Crisis Center to get some information on issues involving domestic violence.

""In fact, we had something in the shelter not too long ago where the abuser had had two or three other victims that we had had here as an agency,"" said Dottie Bromley.

The women who help run the facility also pointed out that domestic violence injunctions are only helpful if an abuser takes it seriously and abides by it.

""A lot of them have a TPO, temporary restraining order, and they still have problems with their abusers,"" said Charmaine Thomas, who also works with domestic abuse victims. ""The problem is they just disregard the piece of paper and just feel like it’s a piece of paper.""

​Jennifer Mathis has been arrested for probation violations but not for the shooting of Dyson. Her arrests are linked to unrelated cases out of Duval and St. Johns counties.

810,Why are we still repeating the mistakes of the past? | Opinion,"Lauren Fantle (Photo: Your Turn)

Exactly six months. It’s been six months since the worst Jewish tragedy in American history, and yet, this past weekend, there was another anti-Semitic shooting. Again in a synagogue. Again on Shabbat, the Sabbath.

Six months ago: October 27, 2018, at the Pittsburgh Tree of Life Synagogue, 11 people were murdered, and seven people were injured — for being Jewish. The murderer was motivated by hate.

This weekend: April 27, 2019, on the last day of Passover, a celebration of Jewish freedom, a 19-year-old entered a synagogue and screamed that Jews are ruining the world. He killed a 60-year-old woman, and he injured a rabbi, a child and a male congregant. Clearly, he hated, too.

We often fear that which we don’t know or understand, and that ignorance breeds hate. Although we are in some dark times, I believe that we can — as an entire community —learn about each other and avoid repeating mistakes of the past. As Anne Frank said, “What is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it happening again.”

Our community has made efforts to come together, and we must continue to move forward in our struggle toward tolerance, acceptance and respect. In order to do just this, Rabbi Romberg of Temple Israel and Rev. Holmes of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church recently traded pulpits for a weekend. This type of modeling of relationship building is what our community needs to supply support, education and understanding to one other. As Romberg said, this is the time to “interact more than to be in our own separate little corners.”

As we interact with others, be it on the job or in our social lives, it is upon all of us to create a safe, healthy, educated community that doesn’t operate on ignorance. If you hear something that vilifies another group or puts them in an “other” category, question it, and then educate yourself.

Yom HaShoah — Holocaust Remembrance Day — begins Wednesday at sundown. Remember the murder of 6 million Jews, and the millions more who were vilified and deemed “other”: LGBT people, Sinti and Roma peoples (sometimes known as Gypsies), Jehovah’s Witnesses, those who were physically or mentally disabled. Take this time to learn about someone of a different religion, lifestyle, age or ability. Take time to get to know your fellow human.

Let’s prevent ignorance and foster a community of understanding. It simply makes sense.

A Lehigh Acres man charged with sexual assault on a victim younger than 12 and cruelty to a child has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Anthony Andrews, 29, was arrested by Lee County Sheriff's Office deputies in January 2018.

A young female victim told investigators that Andrews, who she called ""Gator"", touched her private parts and made her touch his ""peepee"" in late December 2017, police reports indicated. The incident happened in a bathroom at a home in an undisclosed location.

813,Largo beehive relocated to Polk County,"LARGO, Fla. (WFLA) - A beehive that had a Largo neighborhood on edge has been relocated, thanks to beekeepers in Polk Couty.

James Saltzberry, of Beelicious, says he saw our Better Call Behnken report about a woman who is allergic and was stung three times in the past month.

He wanted to help. He had his father run their business together and wanted to save and relocate the bees.

""There's a ton of companies out here that say they're doing what we're doing, and they're killing them off. And obviously we need bees to live. We need them, they don't need us,"" Saltzberry said.

Shelly Hopkins-Rigg, the woman who is allergic, is thrilled.

""I can water my garden every day. I'll have to worry about a bee here and there, but not 60,000 to 70,000 of them, so I'm so happy. Thank you,"" she said.

Pinellas County Code Enforcement officials say they cited the homeowner last week.

The hive was located under a trailer at Cardinal Court Mobile Home Park. Hopkins-Rigg lives in the apartment complex next door.

She turned to Better Call Behnken for help. We took video of the large hive and sent it to Pinellas County Code Enforcement. The video got their attention and officers paid the bees a visit.

""Upon arrival, the officer did feel there was a large infestation of bees and that situation could pose a danger to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Pinellas,"" Jude Reazin, a Code Enforcement supervisor, said.

The question is, who is responsible for the bees being moved?

""There are varying degrees of responsibility when it comes to a mobile home park,"" Reazin said.

""Typically anything that is attached to the mobile home itself is the responsibility of the mobile home owner.""

The bees will go to a farm in Polk County where they can continue to make honey.",http://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/better-call-behnken/largo-beehive-relocated-to-polk-county/1964163226,2019-04-29T21:57:06Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
815,Motion filed to block death penalty in Russell Tillis case,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Having convinced a judge to delay a trial in May, attorneys for Russell Tillis, the man charged with kidnapping, killing and burying a woman in the yard of his Southside home, have filed a motion to block prosecutors from seeking the death penalty.

Attorneys Chuck Fletcher and John Rockwell were appointed in March as the 10th and 11th lawyers to represent Tillis.

Their motion asks Judge Mark Borello to declare Florida’s death penalty law unconstitutional. In addition, the attorneys have filed a motion seeking a mental competency evaluation for Tillis.

Tillis is charged in the murder of Joni Gunter, whose dismembered remains were found buried in his yard in 2016.

Tillis is due back in court Tuesday.

Kingston Crowell and Marion County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremie Nix have a strong bond. From the toddler's first birthday in January to frequent play dates and visiting on Christmas, Kingston has been part of the family to Jeremie Nix and his wife Nikki for the past year, ever since the deputy helped save his life.When Kingston stopped breathing on May 9, 2018, his frantic mother and her sister pulled over and flagged down the deputy. He was captured on dashcam video doing CPR, but when that didn't work, he rushed the baby to Ocala Regional, where doctors revived the child.""I think it was a God thing. I think it was the right place, right time and being put in that position for the right reason,"" Jeremie Nix said. ""I remember dropping to my knees and just screaming, 'Thank God!' I could breathe!"" Nechole Crowell, Kingston's mother, said.Months later, Crowell asked Jeremie and Nikki Nix to be Kingston's godparents, and the two families adopted one another.""Like we were kind of attached from the moment it happened. He just said, 'I'm not leaving your son, until I know he's OK' and it's just been him and Nikki since,"" Crowell said.But over time, the union forged by a life-threatening emergency on the side of the road has evolved into something unexpectedly special.Kingston's fight for survival has spawned a relationship that's changing culture in both families: a woman seeing past the uniform to a hero, and a cop understanding the struggles of a single mother working full-time and earning a nursing degree.""So, it's opened a door to have conversations and create new relationships and friends that we would have never had before,"" Jeremie Nix said.""It doesn't have to be blood related to be family and it doesn't have to be just your family to teach life lessons,"" Crowell said. ""And so he has another family that can teach him a lot more and we can all work together. You know, no matter color, race, whatever, it's just, you see genuine love.""""God's got a great plan for Kingston and he's got great things in store for that little guy that we were able to set on the right path that day,"" Jeremie Nix said.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/sheriffs-deputy-woman-form-deep-bond-after-dramatic-rescue-of-choking-baby/27305665,2019-04-29T14:36:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
817,"After stroke, my only option is to keep going | Gabordi","CLOSE Christina LaFortune chats with FLORIDA TODAY executive editor (retired) Bob Gabordi about his career and life on the Space Coast Rob Landers, FLORIDA TODAY

The woman in the MRI lab recognized me. After all, the last time she saw me was the night I almost died.

“It was quite a night,” she said at least three times as she handed me some papers to sign.

“So I’m told,” I muttered or mumbled or something like that. In truth I have no memory of that night at the Viera Hospital, or the tube that was stuck in me to take over breathing when my body quit. Maybe it’s better that my brain has blocked out that memory.

I did recognize the woman, though. Vaguely — you know how you think you know someone but not enough to say anything because you might be wrong? After all, as she said, that was quite a night.

At lot has happened since then. Too much to put into a single column, maybe too much for my brain to comprehend. My brain is fully functioning. I bring what I’ve always brought, brain-wise.

I retired March 1 after more than 40 years in journalism, but I’m not in love with it.

Oh, don’t get me wrong. I do love hanging out more with my wife Donna and daughter Jessica. And I do love the extra time I’ve gotten to spend with my grandchildren and their parents. But I feel I should be … well, I’m not sure what, but I should be, I know that.

I applied for a job and was one of two finalists in what I’m told was a crowded starting field. I would have loved that job. It met all the criteria I set. But I didn’t get picked. It hurt, of course; I’m not used to losing.

I’ll find something else, I know, that will get me back in the game.

And we’ve overcome other setbacks.

Like walking. Sometimes you just have to pick up your feet and put them back down while pushing yourself forward. I remember struggling even with the help of a walker and people on either side of me to help hold me up to make it to the nurses’ station.

“Hi, nurses,” I said that day. I felt I had conquered the world, even though I had gone maybe 10 or 15 feet.

The other morning was one of those beautiful days when low tide and hard sand coincide with a brilliant sunrise on the beach. I walked 3.6 miles. And I’m closing in on 140 miles since Jan. 1. Talk about a good sign: I had to make a trip to Running Zone for new shoes. My toes were popping through the old ones.

One foot after the other. One at a time. Just keep moving forward. Always forward.

I’m regaining strength and muscle, and I’m still losing weight: more than 35 pounds since the stroke Nov. 9. My blood pressure, cholesterol and heart rate would look good on any teenager. I’m healthy and getting more so by the day.

There remain challenges, including the big one: swallowing, my last major obstacle. Since I last wrote about my recovery, I’ve been able to swallow water. It’s hard work, but it happens. The modified barium swallow study showed water went down my throat. Nothing more substantial yet, but the muscles worked, kind of, and my hope it that through therapy and hard work, I’ll more completely regain that function, too.

Right now, it is kind of a trickle, but the hope is we’ll retrain the muscles, strengthen them and eventually I’ll eat again. Until then, I take in nutrition through a tube. But I’m still battling.

Don’t bet against me. Don’t tell me it’s iffy. Don’t paint worst-case scenarios for me. I’ve had therapists and others do that and I don’t want to hear it. I’ve never had any place in my life for negative thinkers. Since I left the hospital in December, some people have been waiting for me to fall. It hasn’t happened, despite my lack of coordination at times.

But it could happen. I might fall at some point.

Guess what. If it does, I promise I’ll get back up and keep going, because that is all I know how to do.

The 11-year-old boy who was thrown out of the van is Stephon Nihal of Port St. Lucie. The two other people in the van were 35-year-old Mallisa Bridgelal and Jadien Nihal, 5, both from Port St. Lucie.

All four people in the car were wearing seat belts, according to the press release.

819,'She's part of my family now:' Pensacola woman donates kidney to former employee,"CLOSE A Pensacola woman donated her kidney to her former employee in January. Here, the two discuss the special bond they've forged over the past nine years. Jacob Newby, jnewby@pnj.com

The boss-employee relationship between Pensacola woman Donna Huelsbeck and Diana Petersen, of Somerville, Alabama, is far from typical.

That was made clear in 2010 when Petersen, an accountant suffering from the early stages of kidney failure, explained to her boss that she would one day need a kidney.

Huelsbeck had a compatible blood type, and without so much of a hint of trepidation, she told Petersen that when that day came, she would happily donate one of her kidneys.

Grogan Strong: 'It gives us hope:' Pensacola rallies around police officer with brain cancer

""Back then, she told me, 'I'm going to give you a kidney,'"" Petersen recalled. ""You never know, in my situation, when you're going to need it. And a lot of people will say, 'I'll do it.' But I could tell, she was really gung-ho.""

Earlier this year, Huelsbeck made good on that commitment, saving Petersen with a kidney transplant at a time when the woman's bout with Polycystic Kidney Disease had taken a turn for the worse.

""Diana and I clicked from the very beginning,"" said Huelsbeck, who oversaw Petersen when the two worked together at J.H. Wright, an industrial equipment supplier in Alabama. ""No. 1, we hate to even say 'boss,' because she didn't need any supervising.""

While pregnant in 2008 with her now son Garrett, now 10, Petersen learned she had PKD.

""My father, my three uncles, my grandmother on my father's side and then my sister passed away at 26, and we found out during an autopsy that she had PKD, as well,"" Petersen said of her family's tragic battle with the incurable disease.

But Petersen didn't really feel the effects of the hereditary condition until 2018, which is common.

""It's a slow progression,"" said Laura Little, a Fresenius Kidney Care Nurse who helped Petersen with in-home dialysis. ""You don't really have symptoms until you've lost 75% of your kidney function.""

Petersen's kidney function dipped below 25% in 2018, and by September, she started dialysis. She didn't stop working though, often pulling 40-plus hour work weeks while doing her best to keep her condition veiled from her coworkers.

But Petersen admitted her energy was completely zapped.

""I refused to stop working, but I was tired all the time,"" Petersen explained. ""By 1, 2 p.m. in the afternoon, I was ready to go to bed. My husband had to pick up where I left off with taking Garrett to his baseball games. That's when I realized it's probably time to start dialysis. Once I did that, I felt a lot better.""

Volu: 86-year-old retired nurse volunteers weekly at Baptist Medical Park

Little began visiting Petersen's home late last year for home dialysis.

""I had to have a surgery to have a port put in, which, it was basically put in my abdomen, there was this 12-inch tube that came out. And that was a little bit shocking,"" Petersen said. ""When you wake up, you have this image. My little boy called it my 'tentacle.'""

Petersen eventually conducted home dialysis by herself, hooking up to a dialysis machine every day from 7:30 p.m. until 5:30 a.m. the next day.

The transplant surgery was originally estimated to take place this month, but Huelsbeck's son is a pitcher for the University of West Florida baseball team and she wanted to push up the surgery.

""I said it had to be either January or June, I wasn't going to miss any of his season,"" Huelsbeck said.

The sooner the better for Petersen, so the surgery took place Jan. 18 at UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama.

It went off without a hitch, and both women say they've been complication-free since the procedure. Petersen said she's up to 77% kidney function and feels better than she has in years.

""I'm extremely grateful,"" she said. ""It's a new life. I never realized how sick I was until the day after surgery. You wake up after surgery and automatically feel different.

""But I can't even explain to Donna how grateful I am,"" Petersen added. ""She's part of my family now.""

Though the two haven't worked together since 2012, they've obviously remained very close.

And even something so potentially divisive as Huelsbeck's Alabama Crimson Tide fandom and Petersen's love for the Auburn Tigers can't break their lifelong bond.

""Things are rocky in November when the Iron Bowl comes around,"" Huelsbeck joked. ""But now she's got some Crimson Tide blood in her.""

The Pine Bluff Commercial reported Wednesday that both sides agreed on the sentence after Patricia Hill, a former Sunday school teacher, was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of Frank Hill at their Pine Bluff home about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southeast of Little Rock.

Hill testified that she wasn’t thinking when she killed her husband last July and only meant to get his attention. According to testimony, she’d previously canceled the channel from their service twice but shot her husband after seeing the channel had been added again.

At least 22 separate 911 calls informed operators about a “dangerous environment” in a Wichita mobile home before a toddler was found dead and an infant severely injured earlier this month.Officers responding to the last call on April 11 found Zaiden Javonovich, 2, dead and his 4-month-old brother seriously injured. Officials said Zaiden had been dead for days when his body was found in a crib.The two were underweight, with Zaiden weighing just under 15 pounds and his brother weighing 8 pounds, according to a probable cause statement. The statement also said both children showed signs of physical abuse.Most of the emergency calls came from Zaiden’s parents, Brandi Marchant and Patrick Javonovich, who are now charged with felony murder and child abuse. Other calls were from the children’s grandmother, who was asking for help for the children.The calls included shouting, allegations of domestic violence, and a woman crying and asking for help, and show that authorities were aware of problems at the home, according to copies of the calls obtained by The Wichita Eagle.A social worker for the Kansas Department of Children and Families saw the family in their home on Nov. 28 and reported the children were healthy. On a visit Dec. 12, Marchant completed a safety plan. The agency closed the case Jan. 14 without finding abuse or neglect.The Eagle reported a typical call would include Marchant, 22, threatening to kill herself or Javonovich, 28, throwing clothes outside and threatening to set them on fire. Children can be heard in the background of some of the calls.Officers responding to the home on April 11 found Zaiden’s parents fighting outside while the children were inside. Marchant told investigators she was upset that Javonovich let her sleep all day, while Javonovich said she was upset about the baby crying, according to the statement. Officers that night found Zaiden’s body inside the home.Donna Lloyd, Javonovich’s mother and Zaiden’s grandmother, called 911 several times, but it is unclear if her complaints were forwarded to the DCF or resulted in any legal action, The Eagle reported.On Jan. 27, Lloyd warned about “a dangerous environment for those two babies.” She said she was frustrated that her son was staying in a toxic relationship with Marchant, who she said would threaten to kill herself and the baby when Javonovich was at work.Zaiden’s family told the newspaper they have been advised by an attorney not to speak to the media.Sedgwick County sheriff’s deputies handled most of the calls, with only four of 20 calls resulting in reports.Sheriff’s spokesman Lt. Tim Myers said in an email that he doesn’t “consider that to be a lot of contact for the area that they resided.” He said none of the four cases involved child abuse or neglect, adding that there is no documentation showing that the sheriff’s office contacted the DCF.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/22-calls-to-911-2-year-old-died-parents-charged-with-murder-zaiden-javonovich/27321266,2019-04-30T15:57:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
833,"Coachella puppies dumped in trash open eyes, health improving","- A litter of newborn puppies that were saved after their owner threw them in a trash bin in Coachella appear to be getting healthier and have now opened their eyes.

Riverside County Animal Services shared a photo of the 6 puppies to Facebook, who are now in the care of a foster volunteer.

""The woman who has graciously dedicated many hours and a fair amount of her own money toward these abandoned puppies is doing a great job,"" said animal services.

Seven puppies were originally found but the runt of the litter died days later.

""He was just so weak and held on for as long as he could,"" wrote the volunteer on social media. ""When I got him, he was pale and kind of flat looking, so I think he was the cushion that saved his siblings. As the lady threw them in the bag, I think he was at the bottom and took the hit when all of his siblings landed on him.""

Deborah Culwell was arrested after police said she dumped the 3-day-old newborn pups. During a search of her home, investigators found nearly 40 other dogs living in deplorable conditions. The dogs have officially been relinquished to Riverside Animal Services, according to a press release.

""The 38 seized dogs remain at the Coachella Valley Animal Campus in Thousand Palms. These dogs will be made available for adoption or transfer to the department’s rescue group partner organizations this week.""

For now, the 6 Coachella puppies will remain in the care of the foster volunteer who has been nursing them.

Brevard County synagogues continue to be on the alert while reviewing security plans following a shooting at a San Diego Chabad center that left a woman dead and three others wounded on the last day of Passover.

“It’s important that we are strong and steadfast in our spirit. We cannot allow our life to change,” said Rabbi Zvi Konikov, who leads the Chabad of the Space and Treasure Coasts in Satellite Beach.

“On the other side, we need to practically secure ourselves.""

The shooting at the Chabad of Poway took place during the Saturday services marking the last day of Pesach or Passover, one of the busier times of the year for synagogues worldwide. The 19-year-old gunman, whose AR-style weapon jammed following the first wave of shooting, was later captured.

In the days that followed, Jewish worship centers have been discussing security measures in the wake of growing anti-Semitic episodes - from graveyard desecrations to troubling rhetoric turning up on the internet - worldwide.

The shooting at the Chabad in San Diego also came six months after 11 people were killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue and after mass shootings at a Christchurch, New Zealand mosque left 49 dead in March and a wave of coordinated Easter bombings killed at least 253 people.

In Brevard, the sheriff’s office – which offers training to businesses and other entities on ‘active shooter’ scenarios, has discussed security preparations with a number of worship centers in the past. Some Brevard congregations also allow for some members with concealed license permits to carry secured weapons during events. Konikov said the sheriff's office reached out to the congregation shortly after word of the San Diego attack.

The Chabad in Satellite Beach - part of an international network of Jewish outreach centers from the U.S. to Europe, Asia, and Africa - is also talking with other Chabad Houses about security assessments and potential vulnerabilities.

“We’ll be getting guidance and we are in touch with other centers,” Konikov said, adding that law enforcement agencies reached out immediately following the latest shooting. Patrol cars were dispatched to beef up the routine patrols at area synagogues. He also said that the center is not disclosing what measures it has taken but that ‘we are working very closely with law enforcement as to what measures we take.’

Brevard’s other synagogues are also stepping up security.

“Once again, we find ourselves in mourning, six months to the day after the shooting in Pittsburgh – the worst anti-Semitic violence in US history – it happens again, at the time for Yizkor services on the last day of (Passover),” Rabbi Craig Mayers of Temple Beth Sholom in Melbourne said, adding that deputies turned up at the synagogue shortly after the shooting.

“Attacks on houses of worship are on the rise. Just one week ago, a massacre in Sri Lanka. Six weeks ago, mosques in New Zealand. And now, again, Jews are targeted simply for who they are,” he said.

Although no formal memorials or vigils have been planned for the San Diego shooting, both Konikov and Mayers urged worshippers to not be deterred and to turn up for Sabbath services this weekend. ""We will continue living our Jewish lives proudly, openly and in unity with our Jewish brethren everywhere,"" he said.

840,Attorneys for woman in spa case argue for protection of alleged lewd videos,"WEST PALM BEACH — Attorneys for a woman who investigators say was involved in providing sex services to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and others are expected Monday to argue why videos apparently depicting the acts should be protected from release.

The case of Lei Wang, 45, one of four women arrested in connection with the Orchids of Asia Day Spa probe, is scheduled at 1:30 p.m. before Circuit Judge Joseph Marx.

The case involving Orchids of Asia began being disclosed Feb. 19 at a media briefing at the Martin County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff William Snyder said his agency targeted four spas in Martin County and spoke of the cases in the context of human trafficking.

Investigators were led to Orchids of Asia in Jupiter, where covert surveillance cameras were installed after investigators got a warrant.

Wang’s attorneys in court filings argued for a protective order on the videos, alleging they were improperly obtained and shouldn’t be disclosed.

More: Cases against accused sex spa women winding their way through courts

They argue a release would violate Wang’s right to privacy and would make it difficult for her to get a fair trial.

They also argue the videos are “medical records” and thus confidential and not allowed for release in a records request.

“Here, the police created and seized medical records of therapeutic massage sessions without any notice to the affected parties,” court records said.

According to records, police say Wang was seen on video on consecutive days in January during which Kraft got sex services at the spa.

In legal filings, Wang’s attorneys also said that because a description of the content of the videos has been disclosed, then “there is nothing to be gained” by the video release.

They argue media interest in the videos “appeals to the prurient interests of certain members of the public, and is intended to advance the discussion concerning the conduct of one of the Johns, Robert Kraft, and his conduct with respect to football players.”

Kraft has pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor counts of solicit another to commit prostitution.

Wang’s attorneys in filings said the case has gotten more media coverage than possibly “any other misdemeanor prosecution in recent history.”

Filings state Wang has withdrawn her request for discovery.

That’s the procedure by which defense attorneys compel prosecutors to turn over all evidence they plan to use in the case. Once the material is turned over to defense lawyers, it also becomes public record.

Filings state Wang can’t participate in discovery “without risking the public disclosure and mass dissemination of the videos.”

Meanwhile, attorneys for Kraft on Monday filed for discovery materials, with the exclusion of videos of Kraft at Orchids of Asia Day Spa on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20 and of a traffic stop conducted by Jupiter police on Jan. 19.

Kraft’s attorney’s on Friday began a hearing on a motion to suppress the videos from his case, spending about five hours questioning Jupiter Police Detective Andrew Sharp.

That hearing is expected to continue Tuesday afternoon before County Judge Leonard Hanser. A protective order already was issued for Kraft’s videos in his case.

Wang and another woman arrested in the case, Hua Zhang, 58, also filed a motion to suppress the videos.

Keanna and Akeena's father told Local 10 News reporter Trent Kelly that his daughters were in a car being driven by their godmother when the crash occurred.

Battalion Chief Michael Kane, a spokesman for Broward Sheriff's Office Department of Fire Rescue, said two cars collided just before 11 a.m. Sunday in the southbound lanes of I-95, north of Sample Road. One the vehicles also struck a barrier wall, Kane said.

Lt. Alvaro Feola, a spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said the children were not in car seats. According to the crash report, it's unclear, however, whether the sisters were wearing seat belts.

The crash prompted authorities to shut down several lanes of the highway for more than six hours.

Paramedics took the children to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, where Akeena later died.

The children's father told Kelly that he and his wife are staying by Keanna’s side in the hospital, praying for a miracle.

A man, Zachary Schott, and a woman, Raby Rashida, 34, of Deerfield Beach, were also hurt in the crash. Rashida was taken to Broward Health Medical Center, while Schott was treated at the scene. Both of their injuries were not life-threatening, authorities said.

The FHP is investigating the cause of the crash.

A GoFundMe page has been created to help the children's family during their time of need.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — A man in northern Mexico had to be rescued after he accidentally trapped himself in a hole that he dug so he could spy on his former girlfriend in violation of a court order to stay away from her, authorities said Sunday.

The Sonora state attorney general’s office said the 50-year-old man had spent days digging the hole in Puerto Penasco, a town on the Gulf of California, only to become trapped and require assistance to get out.

The man had been ordered to stay away from his former girlfriend due to domestic violence charges and he is now in jail, authorities said.

The newspaper El Universal said the man dug a tunnel under the woman’s house. It said the woman told police that over the course of a week, she had heard scratching noises but assumed the noise was cats. But when the sound grew louder, she investigated and found her former partner of 14 years trapped below, the report said. She said she ended the relationship because her partner was very jealous.

Police said the man appeared intoxicated and severely dehydrated once they got him out of the tunnel.

The 8-year-old boy opened the door to escape but when he began pulling his sister out as well, the suspect grabbed the girl’s hoodie to pull her back in.

Police say the little boy didn’t' give up and was eventually able to pull his sister out of the moving vehicle.

The grandmother was injured in the incident when she tried to stop the suspect by grabbing a hold of the car and was dragged a short distance.

Officers Kirby and Engleka with Middletown Police would later see the stolen vehicle and stop it where they arrested the suspect, 24-year-old Dalvir Singh from India.

Singh has been charged with two counts of kidnapping, felonious assault for dragging the grandmother, and grand theft.

""This little guy is a hero. No question. He pulled his sister out of the car with no concern for his own safety. That is incredible at his age and outstanding work by Officers Kirby and Engleka to find the suspect and take him down without incident. So proud of their work,"" said Middletown Division of Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw.

856,"From Polk County to 'Empire' debut, Sevyn Streeter hasn't forgotten her Haines City roots","- A Polk County woman has made it big in the hip-hop music industry and will soon make her first cameo on the FOX television show, Empire.

Amber Streeter -- best known by her street name, Sevyn Streeter -- is from Haines City and has reached the heights of stardom. Her music has been featured in films like 'Fast & Furious 7.'

While growing up in Florida, she knew she wanted a career in music, she explained during a visit on Good Day Tampa Bay. Streeter said she is proud of where she comes from, and loves her family.

“Shout out to my family in Haines City,” she said. “My family knows…Haines City, Polk County, I’m obsessed. It’s amazing to be home the night that the Empire episode airs.”

The season finale for the show is May 8, but before that, Streeter’s Empire debut will be Wednesday night at 8 p.m. She said there will be a watch party with her family, and she plans to live-tweet.

“I’m so, so excited,” she said. “I’ve been a fan of the show for so long. Some of my best friends have been on the show. One of my best girlfriends, Seryah, she plays Tiana. I was like, ‘Oh my god, it’s like take your best friend to work day.’ It’s amazing.”

When it comes to life in the music industry, she said shows like Empire offer an interesting glance inside that world.

“Me being a singer, songwriter and being in the music industry,” Streeter explained. “It’s way more dramatic on the show, but they really do a good job of giving you guys the insight on what goes on.”

Streeter said she is putting the finishing touches on her next project, “Drunken Words, Sober Thoughts.”

“A lot of my music, it’s always very honest,” she explained. ""I’m in a new space in my life. I was able to have parties in my sessions every single night and for everybody to let their hair down. When you have a drink or two, you tend to tell more of the truth.”

857,'Sexiest Vegan Next Door' contestant lives in Lee County,"Sure, go ahead and call her one of America’s ""Sexiest Vegans Next Door."" Daniela Habermehl says she’s OK with that — even though she doesn’t particularly see herself as a model of sexiness.

“I’ve never classified myself as that,” Habermehl says. “If anything, I’m more modest and I don’t put myself out there in that way.”

Nevertheless, the Lehigh Acres resident is one of 20 men and women competing in PETA’s annual “Sexiest Vegan Next Door” contest.

The winners will be announced May 20 after two more weeks of online voting. Voting ends at noon Monday, May 13.

Habermehl and the other contestants were chosen from hundreds of submissions, according to Sadie Buckles, campaign coordinator for the national animal-rights group.

“It’s based on their general enthusiasm for veganism and living a vegan lifestyle, their personal stories and their photos,” Buckles says. “Not only is Daniela a very attractive vegan, but she used to be a 4-H program participant. Now she’s a dedicated advocate for animals.”

Habermehl became a vegetarian seven years ago and a vegan two years ago. She’s also an animal-rights advocate who attends protests, plans to start a local sanctuary for abused and neglected farm animals, and travels to storm-ravaged cities to rescue abandoned animals.

The Riverdale High graduate says she hadn't considered applying to the annual contest. But then several friends persuaded her to do just that — not for bragging rights and not for the grand prize (an eight-day vacation to Hawaii), but for the chance to get her name and her cause out to the public.

“I’m not a fan of exploitation of myself and kind of the whole sexual side of how women are objectified,” says Habermehl, who works as a local IT manager. “But I just felt like I had to put myself out there for the animals.

“I’m really excited just to be able to share my journey to veganism and show people the truth behind the (meat) industry and also kind of educate people on the health benefits, the environmental benefits and the three pillars for me — for the planet, for the animals and for your health.”

The Fort Myers native says the vegan lifestyle helped her lose 50 pounds and control a thyroid condition. “Going vegan has really stabilized my thyroid and allowed me to have more energy, and just kind of have a healthier body and skin and hair.”

Plus the lifestyle is better for the planet, she says, and certainly better for the animals.

The PETA member has a complicated history with the meat industry. When she was about 8 or 9 years old, she raised pigs for slaughter as part of the national 4-H youth program. And it made her cry every year when she had to say goodbye to the animal she’d fed and tended for months.

More than two decades later, Habermehl still bursts into tears when talking about the experience.

“Sorry if I get emotional,” she says after pausing to compose herself. “I just remember sitting in my pen with my pig every year and having to say goodbye — knowing they were going to get slaughtered.

“There was no way you could keep your pig, even if you wanted to. You couldn’t just take your pig home. … And I had to hide in my pen while I was crying. I didn’t want anyone to know I was so upset.”

Now Habermehl has said goodbye to meat, eggs, milk and all other animal-based products. But she still feels guilty about her previous life as a meat eater and in 4-H.

“I used to love the taste of it,” she says. “But at the end of the day, I don’t think an animal’s life is worth it or the suffering is worth it.”

The annual ""Sexiest Vegan Next Door"" contest was designed to promote and encourage the vegan lifestyle across the country, says Buckles of PETA.

People like Habermehl can serve as role models for others, she adds. “By sharing her story and how she’s living and thriving on this vegan lifestyle, we’re hoping that she’ll inspire others to look at their own plates and their own shopping carts and leave animals out of it.”

Along with online voting, the winners will be determined by a panel of PETA judges. The judges' criteria include the quality of the contestants’ photos, their enthusiasm for the vegan lifestyle (based on submitted questionnaires) and how well the contestants have promoted the competition on social media.

Habermehl says she never thought she’d make it to the finals. But she’s glad she did.

“The contest, for me, is not about showcasing myself,"" she says. ""It’s more about being the platform to really bring activism to life and get more people thinking about the plant-based lifestyle.”

“I’m honored and definitely hoping to win so I can use that to continue my efforts and make more of an impact.""

Model Halima Aden made ""Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue"" history by becoming the first Muslim woman to wear a hijab and burkini in the magazine. While the annual issue has been around since 1964 and has given us legends such as Tyra Banks, Christy Brinkley and Kate Upton (who famously sported barely-there bathing suits), this year's installment marks the first time the magazine has incorporated these modest styles into its editorials. Aden, who is Somali-American, was born in Kenya and lived at the Kakuma Refugee Camp until she was 7 years old before moving to the United States, according to ""SI Swim."" Her editorial came full circle when the crew photographed the 21-year-old model in her picturesque homeland. ""We brought her to both the turquoise water and white sand beaches of coastal Malindi and the mind-blowing Masai Mara at Hemingway’s Ol Seki Mara Camp,"" editor M.J. Day told ""People."" ""Everything she saw was a first for her, and when we touched down on the airstrip on the Mara, there were giraffes roaming around, just seemingly waiting for us right there and she just lost it.""For Aden, the opportunity to take part in a momentous shoot without compromising her morals and values is both exciting and validating. She posted a stunning image from the shoot and behind-the-scenes video to her Instagram, along with an empowering caption: Don’t change yourself .. Change the GAME!! Ladies anything is possible!!! Being in Sports Illustrated is so much bigger than me. It’s sending a message to my community and the world that women of all different backgrounds, looks, upbringings ... can stand together and be celebrated. Thank you so much @si_swimsuit & the entire team for giving me this incredible opportunity. Shot by photographer Yu Tsai, Aden wore two custom-made burkinis, one of which was created by Cynthia Rowley, according to ELLE. ""When we were approached to create a custom burkini for Halima, I was so honored,"" Rowley said in a press release. ""Halima is making strides in the industry through her powerful voice and she is now the first model in history to wear a burkini in the 'Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.' This moment in particular marks a huge win for women’s empowerment, shattering outdated standards of beauty and identity in the industry.""Like her peers Priyanka Chopra, Vanessa Williams and Olivia Culpo, Aden previously competed in beauty pageants. When she was 19 years old in 2016, Aden participated in the Miss Minnesota USA competition and wore her hijab throughout the event, according to the ""Today"" show. She also wore a burkini during the swimwear portion of the event. Although she only made it to the semifinals of the pageant, Aden eventually signed with IMG Models. (Gisele Bundchen, Alek Wek, and a slew of Victoria's Secret Angels are all signed to the agency). Since then, she's landed various campaigns such as Fenty Beauty, editorials and walked down numerous runways, including Kanye West's Yeezy season five show.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/halima-aden-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-hijab-burkini/27326314,2019-04-30T22:09:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
859,"Ohio boy, 8, who saved himself and sister from kidnapping is praised for quick thinking","- A police department in Ohio is praising the actions of an 8-year-old boy after he saved himself and his sister from an attempted kidnapping on Thursday when their grandmother's vehicle was stolen.

The incident happened in Middletown, Ohio after the children's grandmother had gotten out of the vehicle while taking another woman into the emergency room at a hospital and 24-year-old Dalvir Singh jumped into the driver's seat.

That spurred the boy, identified by Middletown Police as Chance, and his sister Skylar to take action as the vehicle sped away.

""This little guy is a hero. No question,"" Middletown Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw said in a statement. ""He pulled his sister out of the car with no concern for his own safety. That is incredible at his age and outstanding work by Officers Kirby and Engleka to find the suspect and take him down without incident.""

As the vehicle began to take off, Chance opened the door of the vehicle to escape as his sister attempted to jump until Singh grabbed the girl's hoodie, according to police.

""We both started screaming and then my grandma went out and grabbed a hold of the car and he just kept opening and shutting the door trying to get her off,"" Chance told FOX19.

Her brother was eventually able to grab a hold of her and pulled her away from the 24-year-old, sending both children tumbling out of the car in a moment that was captured on surveillance video.

""What do you see here? If three heroes was the answer then you are correct!"" police said in a Facebook post.

""Chance made sure that he and his sister Skylar got out of their car when it was stolen,"" police said. ""They weren't about to be taken by some stranger!""

The grandmother of the children, 69-year-old Nita Coburn, made a valiant effort to save the kids by trying to grab onto a door before being dragged. Coburn did not suffer any serious injuries after the incident, according to FOX19.

Singh, who police said is addicted to heroin, was taken into custody and charged with two counts of kidnapping, felonious assault and grand theft.

The man accused of killing five people at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, changed his plea Monday to not guilty by reason of insanity.Lawyers for Jarrod Ramos said in a court filing that the 39-year-old Ramos was not criminally responsible ""because of a mental disorder."" Monday's filing in the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court also said he lacked the ""capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.""Five people were fatally shot in June 2018 in the Capital Gazette newsroom. Ramos was indicted on 23 charges in the attack, including first-degree murder. Ramos had initially pleaded not guilty, and the change of plea filed Monday maintains the not guilty plea.If Ramos were ultimately found not criminally responsible, he could be confined to a mental health prison facility. A November trial has been scheduled.Ramos has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Ann Smith and Wendi Winters.At a court hearing earlier this month, an attorney for Ramos made several references to his client's ""bizarre language"" and ""bizarre behavior"" leading up to the June 28 mass shooting. Attorney William Davis said Ramos had ""longstanding"" mental health issues and a period of ""mental health disturbances."" Davis also said a mental health expert has been working with the defense.The state will conduct its own evaluation to determine whether Ramos was not criminally responsible. A doctor independent from the prosecution will write a report with recommendations and that report will then be sent to defense attorneys, prosecutors and the court.Generally, a judge or jury would consider whether the defendant is not criminally responsible after the trial.Prosecutors are seeking life in prison without possibility of parole.Police said Ramos had used a shotgun to blast his way inside the newsroom. He also has been charged with attempted murder, assault and gun crimes.According to prosecutors, Ramos carefully planned the attack and barricaded the rear exit of the office to prevent people from escaping. Police say they captured Ramos hiding under a desk at the Capital Gazette office after the attack.Ramos, of Laurel, Maryland, had a well-documented history of harassing the newspaper's journalists. He filed a lawsuit against the paper in 2012, alleging he was defamed in an article about his conviction in a criminal harassment case in 2011. The Capital had published a story describing allegations by a woman who said Ramos harassed her online for months. The defamation suit was dismissed as groundless, and Ramos railed against staff at the newspaper in profanity-laced tweets.In the days following the attack, area judges and an attorney received letters that threatened the newsroom and were signed with Ramos' name.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/man-accused-of-killing-5-in-newspaper-massacre-takes-up-an-insanity-defense/27312703,2019-04-30T15:19:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
861,Brother of SoCal terror suspect says family is shocked,"- 22-year-old James Domingo says ""This whole thing is surprising to us to all the Domingo family and to our relatives."" He's talking about the Friday arrest of his 26-year-old brother Mark Steven Domingo on terrorism-related charges.

When the FBI knocked on the family's Reseda door Saturday with a search warrant James Domingo was there. ""Of course we complied. We were compliant. "" says the younger brother. ""We did not resist. We allowed them in to search the house. They showed us the warrant.""

He says, ""I never thought my brother would be charged with any of this."" And, he says he never saw any signs of change after his brother, a former Army infantryman who served in Afghanistan, changed his religion about a year or so ago to Suni Islam.

When asked about that he said, ""I don't want to assume a thing when someone joins a new religion. If anything I thought it was a good thing. I thought maybe my brother found some sort of guidance in this world."" When asked if his brother needed guidance he paused and then said, ""a bit."" He wouldn't elaborate.

When investigators arrived Saturday, he said, they left with a lot of boxes and material as part of their investigation.

A lot of neighbors around here saw the FBI agents wondering what was going on.

One woman said she went into her house to hide when told by an agent to go to her home. Most of the neighbors around here said they never knew Mark Domingo and never saw him.

Many were shocked about the allegations. Neighbor Nataly Lopez said, ""Well it scares me I mean I just live up the street... and I have a son.. and what if I'm walking down the street and he goes bezerk.'

Meanwhile, James Domingo says he's still struggling with what's happening to his older brother. When asked if he wanted to say something in defense of him he said, ""I'll do like any American citizen should and wait for the trial.""

Could his brother be guilty of what's being alleged? Says James Domingo, ""mM heart says he wouldn't, but I'm a logical person and I will wait for evidence.""",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/u-s-and-world-news/brother-of-terror-suspect-says-family-is-shocked,2019-04-30T09:26:36Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA",FL,32746
862,Driver in fatal Killearn crash gets jail time for probation violation,"Nikoleta Koikos (Photo: LCSO)

A woman who was arrested after allegedly running over her boyfriend while high on drugs will remain behind bars for violating probation from an earlier case in which she was accused of driving aggressively toward an ex-boyfriend.

Leon Circuit Judge Robert Long sentenced Nikoleta Koikos to 60 days in jail for the probation violation during a court appearance Thursday. The violation stemmed from her arrest earlier this month on DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide charges in the Jan. 12 death of Gary Diskerud Jr.

Diskerud, 34, was killed after she allegedly ran over him, crushing his skull with her Jeep, according to police reports. She told investigators that before the crash, the two of them argued, prompting him to jump out of the vehicle. She took control of the wheel and started to drive away as he held onto the driver's side window.

The back story:

►Driver in fatal Killearn crash says 'freak accident' killed her boyfriend

►Tight-lipped TPD says body found in Killearn Estates road victim of crash

►Killearn Way crash: DUI manslaughter investigation may take time

She realized she ran over something — she thought it was his foot initially — but stopped to check after seeing him in the rear view mirror lying in the road and called 911. By the time a traffic homicide officer arrived, she was nodding off in the back of a squad car. Blood tests later showed she had drugs in her system, including methamphetamine and the powerful synthetic opioid phentanyl.

After her arrest in Diskerud’s death, Koikos was held at the Leon County Detention Center but released after posting $20,000 bail and agreeing to weekly alcohol tests and twice-weekly drug tests. During one of her recent screenings, she was taken into custody on the probation violation, according to court records.

Koikos, 36, could have sought a hearing on the probation violation but declined. Assistant State Attorney Anna Norris asked for 60 days for the probation violation, the maximum for the underlying second-degree misdemeanor. Long agreed with prosecutors, sentencing her to 60 days with credit for time served.

Her lawyer, David Collins of Monticello, earlier asked for Koikos to remain released on bond, noting she had been in ""full compliance"" with terms of her probation. However, Long denied the request. Collins did not return a phone call seeking comment.

863,First openly autistic lawyer continues to fight stereotypes,"A South Florida woman went from being a nonverbal 3-year-old with behavioral issues to becoming the first openly autistic lawyer in Florida, and possibly around the world.

A stream of positive reactions and comments poured in after CBS12 News introduced Haley Moss back in February.

“It’s just been overwhelming, a very exciting four months, beginning with the day that I got sworn in as an attorney,” said Moss, a lawyer at Zumpano Patricios, a Miami-based law firm.

Her story made national headlines.

“The story went viral, which is still blowing my mind. It’s just been overwhelmingly positive with the feedback and everything,” she said. “I am the first autistic attorney, so I am the first one that we know of that is speaking about being on the spectrum and a lawyer.”

To keep the viral momentum going, Moss speaks at news conferences all over the country to address the negative stigma surrounding autism in the workplace.

“I realize that I can help make a difference. What I think it’s important is that I want to change this conversation surrounding autism,” Moss explained. “I think it’s important to make sure that all kinds of minds are welcomed in the workplace. All kinds of people deserve to have a productive life.”

Moss, who practices anti-terrorism and managed care law, says the National Association of Law placement reports only less than one percent attorneys reveal they have a disability.

It’s just one of the staggering statistics she hopes to tackle.

“There is such widespread negative stigma, discrimination, things like that happen, and employers may not be accommodating,” Moss said. “I think that there’s going to be a day that it is going to be widespread enough that there enough openly autistic, or openly disabled people, that are in positions of power, holding jobs that it won’t be newsworthy.”

Her personal and professional mission is to help lead the way of embracing who you are despite challenges, while encouraging business owners to accept neurodiversity.

“I really want to keep this push going to make sure that other people are included, to help take charge, and help lead the inclusion revolution,"" Moss said.

Moss has a lot ahead of her.

She plans to tour around the country to speak at conferences and private functions to show others that anything is possible.

Moss will visit Naples and Tampa next month, then Cleveland in June.",http://cw34.com/news/local/first-openly-autistic-lawyer-continues-fight-stereotypes,2019-04-30T02:55:08Z,WTVX,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407

871,Van crashes into Cory Booker campaign event in Miami Gardens,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - A van crashed into a cafe where Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker was speaking Sunday in Miami Gardens.

The New Jersey senator's speech was interrupted and spectators were evacuated from the Mo Space by Miami Soul Cafe in the 16100 block of Northwest 27th Avenue after the crash.

After a delay, Booker carried on with the speech. Some spectators left shaken after the crash.

Booker was in Miami Gardens to speak about his presidential campaign and advocate for restoring voting rights to people who have been convicted of felonies. In November, Florida voters overwhelming approved changing the law to allow many former felons to voter, but Florida lawmakers have been debating on how to implement the ballot measure. Booker and others say the Republican-led legislature is trying to undermine the measure and make harder for more people to vote.

The woman driving the van was the hurt, and paramedics transported her to a local hospital. It appeared that no one inside the venue was injured.

This is a breaking news story. It will be updated.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - If you live anywhere near the water, you have probably thought about whether your home is in danger of flooding.

This year, thousands are learning they are now inside FEMA’s newly-updated flood zone danger zone. That is motivating some of your neighbors to elevate their thinking when it comes to property their property. Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

In the summer of 2017, Hurricane Irma clobbered Jeff and Kathleen Grant’s St. Petersburg home. Kathleen describes holes in the roof and water coming down the walls.

They thought about making repairs. Then they read the FEMA rules.

Jeff Grant called the 50% rule brutal. That’s because, in flood zones, if your home is damaged and needs repairs costing more than 50% of the house’s market value minus the value of the land, FEMA won’t allow it.

""The cost to fix that was going to be more than the 50% percent,"" Kathleen Grant said. ""So that's when we said, okay we have to re-look at what we're going to do and we came up with this.”

She’s talking about elevating the family home. They hired AJS Construction to do the work. Jeff Grant took pictures and video with his cell phone showing the house slowly going up about twelve feet.

“They got it all the way up in less than two days,"" Grant said.

Randy Young of ARC Design helped the Grants with their remodeling. He says homeowners in flood zones who don’t want to move really just have two other options when disaster strikes.

""You have to either tear it down at that point and build a new home or you lift it and refashion it the way it was or however you want to fashion it at that point,"" Young said.

Homeowners going to new heights to fight Mother Nature

The good news is when you are above the floodplain, you are no longer bound by the 50% rule.

We caught up with AJS Construction President Mike Knapp at another home that he is lifting in Belleair Bluffs. His elevation business is on the rise.

“On this one, we lifted the slab and all,” explained Knapp. “People don't think you can. Well, you can.”

Yes, you can. For about $65 dollars a square foot. That is not cheap, but he says it is much less than new construction.

FEMA’s updated coastal flood maps impact more Bay area homeowners than ever before and more dramatically. For example, on sections of Davis Islands, the base flood elevation is going up another 6 feet, making the base flood elevation level 16 feet.

Is your home in danger?

Rising with the elevation are flood insurance premiums.

FEMA may provide money to qualified homeowners to elevate their homes, but there is a limit. It also takes a lot of time and patience to work through the system.

Dave Jennings is the Floodplain Manager for the city of Tampa. He can only recall FEMA giving money to a resident for an elevation project once in his 38-year career with the city.

""It literally took the woman three years to get her permits and her grant money from FEMA to elevate it 2 feet,"" said Jennings.

Jeff and Kathleen hope by elevating their home now, it will save them time and money in the long run. It’s been a lot of hard work, they admit, but at least now they are flooded with optimism.

There is much to consider before elevating your home. For example, how much will it cost? How high should you go? Will access be a problem? Will your house look proportional with other homes in the neighborhood after it is raised on piers?

""It was hard for me to imagine it,“ explained Kathleen Grant. “But so far, it's turning out exactly like what we were hoping for.""

882,Patient’s new kidney delivered by drone,"The University of Maryland Medical Center received a historic delivery at its Shock Trauma heliport last week: a human kidney, delivered by drone.

The first-of-its-kind delivery was made by the LG-1,000, a 50-pound drone created by the university’s School of Medicine specifically to transport organs, CBS Baltimore reports.

The kidney was successfully transplanted into the patient, a 44-year-old woman who had been on dialysis for eight years, after the April 19 drone flight. The drone monitored the organ’s status during the 2.8-mile journey from the Living Legacy Foundation in west Baltimore.

Researchers say using drones for delivery could revolutionize the organ transplant process, in which delays sometimes cause an organ to be unviable.

Before the flight, researchers conducted test flights with blood tubes and eventually a healthy but non-viable kidney, USA Today reports.

“There remains a woeful disparity between the number of recipients on the organ transplant waiting list and the total number of transplantable organs,” project head Joseph Scalea said in a statement. “This new technology has the potential to help widen the donor organ pool and access to transplantation.”

Scalea, one of the surgeons who carried out the transplant, praised the “outstanding collaboration” between “surgeons, engineers, the Federal Aviation Administration , organ procurement specialists, pilots, nurses, and, ultimately, the patient.” The current system, he said, takes “too long, it is unsafe and it is way too expensive.” (Read more drone stories.)

890,Winners blast past the scenic flowers at Rose City Run,"Buy Photo Herb Wills, running column. (Photo: Democrat files)

Thomasville, Georgia's 98th annual Rose Show and Festival concluded on Saturday, April 27. You could certainly see some beautiful blossoms at the Show, but you could also see many still on the bush at the Thomasville Rose Garden near Cherokee Lake. Even just strolling around town you could view blooms in yards and green spaces.

If you wanted to cover more ground, you could have done your viewing while running Thomasville's 42nd annual Rose City Run, a 10K. Not everyone in the run was flower watching, though. Chris Haynes hardly had the time for it as he won the 6.2-mile race in 31.35. Nor was Ann Centner stopping to smell the roses as she raced to a women's title in 36:57, placing sixth overall.

""We want to get going before it warms up,"" declared race director Dr. Jim Story as the runners gathered on Broad Street for the 8 a.m. start of the 10K. ""Right now it's perfect for running.""

Dr. Story wasn't exaggerating. It was bright, calm, dry, and cool, with temperatures in the 50s. The consensus was that it was a good morning for a race, a consensus shared by Chris Haynes. The Tallahassee runner had other concerns, though.

""I'm worried,"" admitted Haynes. ""There are some fast guys here. Nathan Haskins, and maybe someone even faster.""

Haynes was a two-time Rose City Run champion, with wins in 2017 and 2018. But Haskins, a Thomasville runner, also had two Rose City wins to his credit, one in 2009 and another in 2015. Right after the start of the race, Haskins took the lead. Haynes trailed a few steps back. The two left the rest of the field far behind.

""Did you see the random surges he was putting in?"" said Haynes. ""He must have made 12 of them.""

""We went through three miles in 15:00,"" continued Haynes. ""The next two miles were slow, really slow. At five miles I could feel he was tired from setting the pace and from all the surges.""

Racing side by side, Haynes and Haskins passed the five-mile mark in 25:33. Haynes made a move. Half a mile later, racing past MacIntyre Park, Haynes was over a hundred meters ahead of Haskins and pulling even farther away. A few minutes later Haynes was back on Broad Street crossing the finish line in a winning 31:35, the fastest of his three Rose City wins and the fastest winning time in the race since 2007, when four-time champ Alan Black went 31:21. Haskins took second in 32:50. Tallahassee triathlete Charlie Johnson was third in 35:14.

""For the third year in a row, from Tallahassee, our women's winner was Ann Centner,"" said Dr. Story at the awards presentation. ""36:57. You're getting faster, Ann.""

She is. In her previous Rose City outings, Centner ran 40:56 and 38:27. 36:57 isn't just her fastest mark at Rose City, it's her personal best and first time breaking 37:00.

""I know! I was happy!"" said Centner.

In Thomasville, Centner lined up with three-time Rose City women's champ Sheryl Rosen, a Tallahassee lawyer. Rosen never mounted a challenge, though, as Centner led the women's field from start to finish. Rosen was second in the women's standings and ninth overall in 37:49. Brittney Barnes, another Tallahassee athlete, was the third woman and nineteenth overall in 40:45.

""I don't think I could PR in the mile right now, but 10K is a lot easier now,"" said Centner about her current state of fitness. ""I remember my first 10K, after high school track season. That was awful. I'm doing a lot of quantity now. Six miles of work on the track on Tuesdays, and my long runs are even longer than in college.""

Haynes is also logging a lot of mileage.

""I'm going to be trying to keep over a hundred miles a week in training,"" said Haynes. ""I'm getting ready for the Grandma's Marathon.""

That's the 43rd annual Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota on 22 June 2019. Haynes won't be the only Rose City Runner there; Haskins is also entered. There aren't any marathons in the near future for Centner, though, or even much racing.

""After this I'm taking a little break,"" said Centner. ""And then the Breakfast on the Track Mile in August.""

Centner can be excused an intermission from competition. Over the last four weeks she's run the Springtime 10K, the Palace Saloon 5K, and the Rose City 10K--three races, three wins, and three personal bests.

Myles Gibson of Donalsonville, Georgia was the fastest master runner in the Rose City Run, covering the 10K in 38:17. Gibson was the ninth male finisher in the race and eleventh overall. Tallahassee's Lourena Maxwell was the first woman master, placing eleventh in the women's standings and 41st overall in 45:37.

397 athletes finished the 10K at the 2019 Rose City Run and another 144 completed the kids' mile. Gulf Winds Track Club of Tallahassee chip-timed both races.

891,Suspected serial rapist may be connected to Holly Hill sex attack,"HOLLY HILL, Fla. - Detectives with the Holly Hill Police Department are meeting with state agents to determine if a serial rape suspect is connected to a 2014 sexual attack in the city.

Daytona Beach Police Chief Craig Capri held a news conference Friday and announced the arrest of Markeith Martin, 44.

Police said Martin attacked and choked multiple women in the Volusia County area.

""This guy's a serial rapist,"" Capri said. ""He's going around hunting women and attacking women, and thank God they're alive.""

According to police, DNA evidence linked Martin to a sexual attack in August.

In that case, the victim was riding her bicycle on Peninsula Drive around 6 a.m. Aug. 1, 2018, when her bicycle stopped working and Martin approached her and offered to help, according to the report.

The victim declined the help and the drugs he offered her, police said. Martin then choked and raped the woman, according to the affidavit. He was violent during the attack and apologetic afterward, the report said.

According to police, Martin is suspected in seven attacks from 2010 and 2018.

Capri said Martin was convicted in 2014 of a sex crime, but only served 37 months and was not required to register as a sex offender.

""Thirty-seven months doesn't seem like a lot of time for someone who commits a rape, a crime like that that basically destroys the sanctity of the victim, it destroys them for life. They're scarred with this for life and this guy gets 37 months to come back on the streets and do it again,"" Capri said.

A representative from the Department of Corrections said Martin served time for a simple battery, but never for a sex crime.

A judge on Saturday ordered Martin to be held without bond on a single charge of sexual battery.

WESTMORELAND, Tenn. (WKRN) - (WKRN) - Officials with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation are investigating after a total of seven bodies were found between Saturday night and Sunday afternoon in Westmoreland.

TBI officials initially said five people were killed and a woman was seriously injured in Sumner County on Saturday night, which is currently under investigation by the TBI and Sumner Co. Sheriff's Office.

Officials confirmed two more victims were discovered by agents Sunday while processing the scene at Charles Brown Road, where four other people had been found dead Saturday. News 2 has also confirmed that one of the victims at the Charles Brown Road scene was a 12-year-old.

According to Sumner Co. District Attorney Ray Whitely, another deceased victim was found near a home on Luby Brown Road. Her car was also stolen. Whitely could not confirm if the woman's death was random or if she is also a relative of the other victims.

Investigators say the scenes are at two sperate residences in Westmoreland and are related.

According to Sheriff Sonny Weatherford, deputies responded to the scene after a family member of the victims found four people dead at a home in the 1000 block of Charles Brown Road.

A woman was also found injured at the scene. She was transported to Skyline Medical Center for treatment. According to a family member, the woman was still in critical condition on Sunday morning.

Through their ongoing investigation, agents identified Michael Cummins, 25, as a suspect in the homicides.

After a coordinated search with multiple law enforcement agencies and a helicopter, authorities located Cummins in a creek bed approximately one mile from the first scene.

When more than a dozen SWAT officers approached Cummins to take him into custody, officials say, the situation escalated. According to DeVine, Cummins pulled multiple weapons, causing at least one SWAT team member to shoot him.

According to the TBI, medics transported Cummins to a local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries As of Sunday afternoon, he remains in the hospital.

No officers were injured in the incident.

Cummins has a lengthy criminal background in Sumner County with signs of escalating violence.

He was first arrested in December 2012 for violation of an order of protection and simple possession of Sch. II drugs. He was released about a month later on time served.

In August 2013, he was arrested again for domestic assault and sentenced to 150 days in jail.

A few years later, in 2017, Cummins was arrested in Sumner County three more times.

In February 2017, he was charged with theft under $1,000 and evading arrest. Police records indicate he posted bond. Later in June, he served nearly two months in jail for robbery, domestic assault and violation of probation (for the theft charge).

Three months later, in Sept. 2017, Cummins was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, aggravated arson (charge reduced to attempted aggravated arson), escape (reduced to resisting arrest), and violation of probation for domestic assault, evading arrest and theft. He was sentenced to 180 days on each charge day-for-day.

News 2 has requested Cummins' full criminal background and will update this story with more information after we receive it.

Both the homicides and the officer-involved shooting remain under active investigation by the TBI, whose forensic scientists are currently gathering evidence and interviews to determine the suspect's relationship to the victims and a possible motive.

TBI officials give an update on Sumner County murder investigation. Posted by WKRN-TV Nashville on Saturday, April 27, 2019

TBI officials will officially release the identities of the victims once their next-of-kin has been notified.

According to the TBI, releasing the name of the officer who shot Cummins will be determined by the Sumner Co. Sheriff's Office.

899,Jeep runs over woman sunbathing on Florida beach,"FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. - A Florida woman is lucky to be alive after she was run over by a sport utility vehicle Wednesday afternoon while sunbathing on the beach in Nassau County.

News 6 partner WJXT-TV reported that the hit-and-run unfolded about 4:30 p.m. at Peters Point Park, a beach access off South Fletcher Avenue in an unincorporated part of Amelia Island.

The woman, who asked not to be named, said she had gotten off work early, so she went to the beach, where she was lying down on a brightly colored beach towel.

“I had my eyes closed and (was) just lying there enjoying my time and I felt a lot of pain and I looked up and there was a Jeep on top of my legs,” the woman told WJXT-TV.

The driver took off in a light-colored late model Wrangler with a black canvas top.

The woman was taken to Baptist Medical Center Nassau, where she was treated for injuries to her legs. Surprisingly, she didn’t suffer any broken bones or more serious injuries.

905,Judge denies killer's appeal related to his sentence,"The judge affirmed the life sentence of Paul Magill, convicted of raping and killing an Ocklawaha store clerk in December 1976.

A judge has denied to grant a motion made by a 60-year-old man sentenced to life in prison to correct what he said was an illegal sentence.

In rejecting the argument of Paul Magill, Judge Steven Rogers said in his three-page ruling that the ""court finds no grounds whereby the Defendant's Motion should be granted.""

The judge wrote that the court finds ""in entering its January 19, 2017, Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence and Setting Status Conference, Judge Ohlman did not vacate the Defendant's previously imposed sentence. Therefore, the Defendant's sentence, imposed by the court on May 6, 1988, is affirmed.""

The ruling means Magill's sentence remains life in prison. He is incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution.

Magill was convicted in 1977 of first-degree murder, robbery with a firearm and sexual battery of an Ocklawaha store clerk in December 1976. He initially was sentenced to death but that sentence was vacated in 1988 and he was given life in prison with a minimum of 25 years and then the possibility of parole.



Magill was 17 when he killed the woman and the U.S. Supreme Court found that juvenile offenders cannot be sentenced to life without parole. Since becoming eligible in 2000, Magill has come up for parole review several times but remains incarcerated. Magill filed a motion to correct his sentence, claiming it was illegal.

In another case, the Florida Supreme Court found that a teen’s sentence with the possibility of probation “effectively resembles a mandatorily imposed life without parole sentence,” according to court filings.



After that ruling, in January 2017, Circuit Judge Jonathan Ohlman, who has since retired, granted Magill’s motion, appointed a public defender and set the case for a hearing.



However, in July, the state supreme court moved away from the previous ruling, stating that a juvenile offender’s sentence of life with the possibility of parole after 25 years does not violate the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, according to a motion filed by Assistant State Attorney William Gladson.

In early February, Judge Rogers granted Gladson’s motion to set aside the earlier order for a hearing to correct the sentence.

On April 10 at a hearing in Ocala, assistant public defender Joshua Woodard asked Rogers to reconsider the February ruling that had overturned Ohlman’s decision.

""Hopefully, this gives some comfort to the victim's family, who has been dealing with these issues for over 40 years. I'm pleased that he will spend the rest of his life in prison where he belongs,"" Gladson said Tuesday.

907,"MARK LANE: 80 years ago, a lynching prosecution fell apart","There were gasps in the courtroom when a constable said he didn't know who drew rifles on him and killed his prisoner.

There was collective gasp in a DeLand courtroom when Constable James Durden testified that his memory of events had changed. “Jesus have mercy!” cried a woman in the gallery as Circuit Judge H.B. Frederick shouted for order.

The date was May 27, 1939, 80 years ago, and the large courtroom in the Volusia County Courthouse was stiflingly hot and crowded. Black spectators usually sat in the west gallery, away from the proceedings on the floor, but the crowd of 150 had overflowed into the less-used east gallery because of the intense interest in this trial.

The black community was there in number because the two white men sitting at the defense table were accused of waylaying and executing a black prisoner Durden had been transporting from Daytona Beach to the county jail in DeLand. A lynching. Something that hadn’t happened in Volusia County since 1891. And one that was getting national attention.

Durden had earlier told a coroner’s inquest that on April 29, at 2:15 p.m., he had picked up Lee Snell, 45, a black cab driver, to bring him to the county jail where he would await arraignment for manslaughter. The morning before, at the corner of Second Avenue and Keech Street, Snell’s cab hit Ben Blackwelder, a white 12-year-old riding a bicycle, crushing his skull and killing him.

“I had decided to take Snell to the county jail for safekeeping as I had heard some indications there might be trouble if he was left in city jail,” Durden had told Justice of the Peace Charles Beers.

A prudent precaution. But Durden had only driven four miles out of town on the narrow brick road between DeLand and Daytona Beach when he encountered a car parked sideways in the road, blocking his way. The two men in the car aimed guns at him and ordered him to stop.

He identified them as Everett and Earl Blackwelder, brothers of the dead 12-year-old. Everett had a double-barrel shotgun and Earl had a Winchester repeating rifle.

After a brief struggle with Durden, Everett shot the fleeing Snell in the leg and Earl finished him off with two shots to the chest.

“I’ll see you after the funeral,” Earl shouted to Durden as they drove off. And after the funeral, the father of the two arranged with Sheriff Stone for the brothers’ surrender.

This happened at a time when Florida was dealing with an uptick in racial violence. A black prisoner had been kidnapped and lynched earlier that same month in Panama City. Florida Gov. Fred Cone issued a statement saying, “It is up to the law to take its course” and assigned the Attorney General’s Office to help with the Volusia County prosecution. The story made the inside pages in white newspapers around the nation and was front-page news in the black press.

The trial began May 26, and an all-white jury of 12 longtime residents was picked. The Blackwelder brothers had the best local representation available: William “Billy” Judge, a celebrated defense attorney who would later serve as state attorney, and Thomas Tappy, an attorney connected with the Courthouse Ring political machine.

State Attorney Murray Sams’ prosecution pivoted on the positive identification by the constable, testimony Durden had so far delivered at the inquest and presumably to the grand jury that had indicted the brothers. But once on the witness stand, Durden’s sudden loss of memory sealed the outcome of the case, as the courtroom spectators realized immediately.

Durden told the court his earlier testimony “might have been mistaken” and that he had been “under great mental strain” when he gave it.

The defense rested without calling any witnesses.

“Blackwelder brothers are acquitted. Constable Durden fails to identify brothers as Snell's assailants” was the front-page multi-deck headline in an extra edition of The Daytona Beach Evening News printed within hours of the verdict.

Quick deliberation by an all-white jury after a local official suddenly couldn’t recall the guys who had trained guns on him the month before. A travesty of justice to be sure.

“Citizens of Volusia County and of Florida, the eyes of America and the world are turned this way, taking note of your standard of justice. We are crushed, but we are not discouraged. We believe that justice will somehow triumph,” Mary McLeod Bethune wrote in an impassioned letter to the editor printed afterward in The Daytona Beach Evening News.

To Gov. Cone, the founder of Bethune-Cookman College wrote: “With such an unjust handling of a case of murder, there is no safety for any Negro citizen in this state.”

Despite Bethune’s best efforts, the case soon dropped out of public consciousness. There was, after all, a depression going on and a world war barreling toward us.

As Congress debated an anti-lynching bill the next year, Snell’s killing was brought up by advocates as more evidence that federal intervention was needed and dismissed by opponents as a local revenge slaying that didn’t count as a lynching. The bill passed the U.S. House but died in the Senate.

As for Everett Blackwelder, he would go on to serve as an Army private in World War II. He worked as a mechanic and was in and out of the court system throughout the 1950s on a variety of firearm and alcohol-related offenses until he was sentenced to five years in prison in 1955 for his part in a burglary ring. He died in 1987. His brother Earl died in 1967.

After 80 years, the case remains a mostly forgotten yet indelible stain on the justice system here.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190430/mark-lane-80-years-ago-lynching-prosecution-fell-apart?rssfeed=true,2019-04-30T10:14:10Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

That’s why we need to take down all the tributes and stop playing recordings of the music of Carole King. Sure, she has written a lot of great music over the years, but her 1962 piece, “He Hit Me,” can’t be ignored. “He hit me, and it felt like a kiss, he hit me, but it didn’t hurt me, he hit me, and I knew he loved me. If he didn’t care for me, I could have never made him mad, but he hit me, and I was glad.”

What could Carole have been thinking?

The Crystals, who recorded the song, must be written out of the music world as well.

The Beatles are universally revered but they won’t be now that we’re re-examining everyone’s work through today’s lens.

Violence against women is described in several of their songs from the 1960s.

“I’d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man,” is the first line of 1965’s “Run for Your Life.”

The 1969 song, “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer,” is a jaunty tune about — murder? “Bang clang Maxwell’s silver hammer came down upon her head/Bang clang Maxwell’s silver hammer made sure that she was dead.”

Paul McCartney’s lyric, “I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved,” from 1967’s “Getting Better” at least acknowledges that the behavior was wrong. But admitting to past mistakes can’t save you from the social justice crusade. Take down those Beatles statues.

Ol’ Blue Eyes, the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Frank Sinatra was a hell of a singer but also was known to be a jerk when it came to his attitudes toward women.

That attitude is reflected in his version of one of the most sexist songs ever, “Wives and Lovers.” “Hey, little girl, comb your hair, fix your make-up. Soon he will open the door. Don't think because there's a ring on your finger, you needn't try any more.”

And they play one of his songs after every Yankees home game?

Popular artists from past eras have done work that shocks current sensibilities.

The best way to confront that reality is to dismiss their entire body of work and expunge them from history.

Or, we could recognize that the human condition differs from time to time and place to place.

We could be heartened by the fact that once acceptable biases and stereotypes are no longer mainstream thinking as society evolves and becomes more enlightened.

We could acknowledge the talent and contributions of people in the past, knowing that they, like the rest of us, weren’t perfect and their imperfections were sometimes recorded for posterity.

We could think ahead with a degree of empathy to a time when our behavior, recorded and broadcast much more routinely than in any previous era, might be looked back on by some future generation in a less-than-favorable light.

Nah, it’s easier to just take down the statues and stop playing the songs.

909,"Shooter hits 10 Georgia schoolkids, with BBs or pellets (PHOTOS)","ATLANTA — Schoolyard routine turned into chaos Thursday at a DeKalb County elementary school when children began running and parents began getting reports with the words that have become one of their nightmares: active shooter.

It turned out the shots that struck 10 students at Wynbrooke Traditional Theme School came from a BB or pellet gun, and no injuries were life-threatening.

Shortly after lunch, children were on the playground at the Stone Mountain school when shots came from a wooded area adjacent to the playground.

Not knowing exactly what was going on, panicked parents rushed to the school to pick up their children.

Tarik Edmondson was among the first to arrive. “You just panic and you want to get your child,” he told members of the media assembled at the entrance.

Barbara Madison, who lives nearby and had rushed to get her niece, said, “My heart dropped when I heard about it.”

The shots appear to have come from a position away from the school grounds, a statement from the district said. It is not clear if the students were targeted. DeKalb County School District police were still searching Thursday afternoon for the person who fired them.

District officials said there will be increased police presence at the school Friday.

Neither school officials nor school police would confirm if students would be allowed on the playground Friday. A suspect had not been identified.

The access road to the north of the school complex was blocked by police. There’s a small playground on that side of the school where kindergartners and first graders often play — away from the bigger kids. The school goes up to fifth grade. There wasn’t much police presence near the playground designated for older students.

The school system did not give the ages of those who were shot.

Nine students were taken to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston and one was picked up by parents, according to according to hospital spokeswoman Ayana Isles. She said all were in good condition and none had to stay in the hospital.

Caleb Edmonson, 11, told WBS-TV Channel 2 that his class was at lunch when a teacher asked a janitor to lock the doors and close the blinds.

“People started to think it was a drill,” Edmonson said, “but then like a couple of minutes later we saw an ambulance and police officers coming in, running down our hallways.”

A statement signed by Principal Jermain Sumler-Faison said, “There was never a threat of anyone getting into the school building and the remaining students were not injured.”

Several parents told reporters they got very little information from school officials.

“I got a text from Channel 2,” a woman who wouldn’t give her name said. “If it wasn’t for the news, I wouldn’t have known anything.”

Student Mya Mark said she was at lunch when she saw an ambulance pull up to the school.

“I was scared,” she said. “I didn’t know what to do.”

Kevin Johnson said his son was struck in the back by a pellet or BB. The kindergartner was expected to be released from the hospital Thursday, as his injuries weren’t life-threatening.

Johnson was grateful for the quick response of emergency workers and said he’s glad it wasn’t a real gun.

The school was put on a level two lockdown, which means all classroom doors are locked, students and staff are not allowed to leave the classroom and all visitors and vendors in the building must immediately report to the main office.

The Orchards subdivision runs along the north side of the school. Several police vehicles were stationed Thursday on Orchards Walk, the main road into the subdivision, as officers appeared to investigate homes on that side of the school.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190429/shooter-hits-10-georgia-schoolkids-with-bbs-or-pellets-photos?rssfeed=true,2019-04-29T10:52:54Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA",FL,32548
910,Florida Southern College business student David Balandi launches self-named sports apparel company,"David Balandi's self-named apparel company combines business with philanthropy. It's mission: Believe, Achieve, Lead, Accomplish, Nourish, Dedicate, Inspire.

LAKELAND — Perhaps someday the name Balandi will be as recognizable in the sportswear realm as Nike, Adidas and Puma.

For now, David Balandi is a Florida Southern College student who has already realized an aspiration formed in eighth grade to create his own business.

Balandi, a native of the African nation of Chad, launched a self-named apparel company two years ago, drawing upon advice from professors in FSC’s Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise. His youth is not the only element that makes the company unusual.

Balandi, 20, also made philanthropy part of his business model. The company includes a separate line, and all proceeds from those sales are devoted to a program that supports orphans in Africa.

Among the 70 products available from Balandi’s online store are a blue T-shirt emblazoned with the word “BELIEVE” below a stylized “B” and women’s tights in black with white letters spelling out “PERSEVERE” on the lower leg.

Using the letters of his last name, Balandi created an acronym that projects his company’s principles: Believe, Achieve, Lead, Accomplish, Nourish, Dedicate, Inspire.

“Our mission is a vision of achieving,” Balandi said, sitting in a conference room at the Becker Business Building on campus. “That’s something I feel very familiar with, and that’s the energy and the motivation that I wanted my company to give off.”

Balandi, who stands 6 feet 3 inches tall, played basketball during his high school days in the West African nation of Burkina Faso. The impetus for his sportswear line arose in the summer of 2017 when he was playing basketball with his older brother, Antonio Balandi, who played last season for Syracuse University.

The brothers noticed that the shorts they wore caused friction on their legs after becoming wet with sweat. David Balandi decided to design a pair of athletic shorts with hemmed bottoms that wouldn’t slide as much during movement.

After having the shorts produced, he asked some Florida Southern basketball players to try them out and got positive reactions. Balandi launched his company and has since expanded into shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts, caps and socks, including products for women.

Every sportswear company needs a distinctive logo, such as Nike’s “swoosh,” and Balandi set out to create an image based on the first letter of his surname. He used various fonts to produce 50 “B’s,” and then he and his brother narrowed their preferences down to a top choice.

The resulting logo is a lower-case “b” with a rounded bottom and a severely shortened ascender, suggesting a stick figure of a cat’s head with only a right ear.

Some of the products bear just the name “Balandi” and/or the logo. Others are printed with such words as “Achieve,” and a purple tank top proclaims “Woman Up.”

Balandi created and operates his company’s website (www.balandi.co), which includes photos of Florida Southern students wearing his products. Balandi said the items are made in Florida, Africa and Asia.

Typical prices are $15 for socks, $20 for caps, $25 for T-shirts and $40 for hoodies.

Balandi, a business administration major scheduled to graduate next fall, said he benefited from concepts he learned in a principals of management course taught by Silviana Falcon, an assistant professor of business administration and health care management.

“Obviously, I’m very proud of him,” Falcon said. “He understands now what a business owner is. It takes a lot of resilience and a lot of work. It’s not for the faint of heart. Running a business in itself is difficult, and then you add the layer of social entrepreneurship and now you’ve made the business endeavor 100 times more complicated.”

Balandi said other FSC professors have provided valuable guidance on accounting and the legal elements of business.

“It’s been really amazing,” he said. “I’m very lucky to be part of a great business school with great faculty members and great students. They have really helped me out in terms of really shaped my vision and shaped what this company means to me.”

After his graduation in December, Balandi plans to run his business out of Catapult, a co-working space in Lakeland geared toward promoting startup ventures.

Balandi has marketed the company through social media, and he enlisted a well-known African comedian, Dulo, to record a commercial. In the spot, the man at first struggles to maintain his balance on inline skates, but after putting on Balandi sportswear he rolls gracefully down the street.

“My balance went from zero to 100 real quick,” Dulo tells the camera.

Though he’ll happily use humor to promote his products, Balandi has a serious purpose for his brand. He spoke of visiting an orphanage in Burkina Faso before starting his company and being shocked to see the children’s lessons were conducted on benches outside.

The company includes the Balandi Kids Program, a nonprofit segment devoted to supporting children in Africa and the United States. Balandi established the $15K Impact program, which aims to raise $15,000 by December for the building of a classroom and library at the Burkina Faso orphanage.

Balandi has a For The Kids line of apparel bearing that phrase and his logo, and he said all receipts from those items go toward the children’s initiative.

Balandi has become active in the Florida Southern chapter of Enactus, a worldwide, college-based nonprofit organization. Along with other Enactus members, he volunteers twice a week at Florida Baptist Children’s Homes in Lakeland.

The students tutor foster children and lead them in social activities. Enactus members have also taken the kids to a Lakeland Magic game and a Florida Southern basketball game, Balandi said.

Falcon serves as faculty advisor to FSC’s Enactus chapter.

“I see in David what I see in a lot of different students, and that is the true desire to help other people through entrepreneurship,” she said. “So that is exciting to see, that this generation is seeing beyond themselves and actually wanting to be part of the solution, and I think Enactus provides that platform.”

LAREDO, Texas (AP) — A South Texas woman granted probation for injuries to her infant son has been sentenced to prison after violating probation when the remains of her 2-year-old daughter were found in a bucket of acid.

Monica Yvonne Dominguez has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for violating probation after she was charged with evidence tampering and child abandonment involving her daughter’s corpse.

She had been sentenced to 10 years’ probation after pleading guilty in 2016 to injury to a child for injuries to her 9-month-old son. State District Jude Oscar Hale Jr. on Friday deemed the new charges violated that probation and handed down the prison sentence. Conviction on the new charges could mean up to two years in state prison on each count.

Dominguez told police her children were bathing unsupervised in their Laredo apartment in February when the girl drowned.

913,"Ocala residents report frauds over phone, text","OCALA — Two unrelated reports of fraud were reported Friday to the Marion County Sheriff's Office.

A 68-year-old Ocala resident told a deputy that she had sent $35,000 in cash by UPS to someone she had met over the phone who supposedly was seeking help for a friend stranded outside the United States.

A UPS employee in Addison, Illinois, noticed the large amount of cash while scanning packages, and alerted law enforcement. Addison Police Department officials said the money is safe and will be returned to the woman.

Also on Friday, a sheriff’s deputy spoke with a 64-year-old man who said he was contacted by a person on Facebook Messenger in January. From there, he said, they began texting. The man was told by the person, who identified herself as a woman, that she has an inheritance from Sweden and needed help to get it.

The man was told until she gets her inheritance, to send her some money. The man said over several months he sent the stranger money through various means such as gift cards and checks totaling $104,879.69.

The victim told the deputy their only communication was through text and they never spoke on the phone.

916,FWC investigators go undercover to combat illegal online sales of wildlife,"Florida Fish Wildlife Conservation Commission investigators recently went undercover to combat illegal internet sales of wildlife in central Florida.

Investigators issued more than a dozen citations and warnings to individuals from multiple counties including Marion, Lake, Sumter and Orange county.

From a spider ball python, a gargoyle gecko, hedgehogs, parrolettes, spider snakes, and even a prairie dog you can find just about anything online.

FWC uncovered dark world of exotic animal sales in an undercover sting dubbed ""Operation Ibis"" to catch individuals sellings wildlife without a permit.

Posing as buyers on Craigslist officers answered ads and busted a 57-year-old woman who attempted to illegally sell two hedgehogs to an undercover officer in a Walmart parking lot in Ocala for $160.00 without a license.

The required ESC license must be issued by FWC but that didn't stop a 47-year-old man from offering an undercover illegal birds in the same parking lot a day later for $200.00.

When the man realized a sale wouldn't be made a report obtained by NEWS 6 reveals he said, ""You set me up, this is one of those buy bust deals.""

This wide-ranging multi-county crime sent covert investigators to an Arby's parking lot in Ocoee where a woman was caught unknowingly trying to sell multiple snakes.

In Wildwood a 20-year-old man was also cited witha second degree misdemeanor for trying to sell a gargoyle gecko at this Zaxby's parking lot.

In an unmarked patrol car FWC investigators used binoculars and waited for a signal from officers before a 64-year-old woman was cited for trying to sell a spider snake to an undercover officer.

Most of the people were cited with second degree misdemeanors. Exotic animals must have oversight and inspections to ensure they aren't carrying disease and come from a safe environment.

922,Florida woman finds large gator knocking at her front door,"- A Florida woman came home to an unwanted guest at her front door.

Donna Heiss tells one station that as she pulled into her garage on Thursday, her neighbors yelled for her to get inside. Once inside, she looked out the glass front door and saw a large alligator looking back at her.

The gator then stands up on its hind legs and peeks inside her home through the window like a Peeping Tom.

She says she was nervous that the gator ""was going to break the glass"" before the alligator trapper arrived. She took cellphone video of the gator pressing its nose against the glass and then walking around the house to find another way inside.

The trapper estimated the gator at between 7 and 8 feet (2.1 and 2.4 meters).

With April comes the start of alligator mating season, meaning more gators are on the prowl in some unlikely places in Florida.

Donna Heiss recorded videos of the pesky gator walking around her front porch at her home on Edward Drive in Palm Coast. The gator then stands up on its hind legs and peeks inside her home through the window like a Peeping Tom!

""It is so important that we are aware of what is outside before we open the door,"" Heiss wrote in a post on Facebook.

Heiss says the alligator was very aggressive. A trapper was called who estimated the gator to be about 7-8 feet long.

929,"Woodbury says he did nothing wrong, but questions about 'The Nation' remain","Buy Photo The Nation Christian Academy on Thursday (Photo: Will Greenlee)

Mike Woodbury hasn't talked to TCPalm in weeks, so I was surprised Monday morning when he returned my call.

I'd asked the CEO of The Nation Christian Academy, which dissolved earlier this month, for his reaction to the latest installment of TCPalm's ongoing investigation. That story focused on Jordi Maatkamp, 18, who came from the Netherlands to play soccer at Nation Christian, only to find out the school didn't have a soccer team.

Maatkamp left after four months — and after his folks had spent $10,000 — believing he'd been sold a bill of goods. But Woodbury said he and Nation Christian did nothing wrong; he never told Maatkamp the school had a soccer team.

More: Nation Christian shuts down

“We didn’t recruit him,” said Woodbury, “he came to us through an agency; our contact said ‘Hey, we have a soccer player who’s willing to pay $15,000.’ ”

That’s often how it works, Woodbury said. Agents will contact him, representing a student-athlete looking for a place to play where they have a shot at a college scholarship — and maybe more.

Jordi Maatkamp (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO FROM ESTHER VAN DER REE-MAATKAMP)

Woodbury insists he never promised Maatkamp a college scholarship, though he conceded the agent might have.

He said the reason the Dutch teen didn't last was because he had academic problems.

Homeland Security may have the last word on that.

The agency is reportedly investigating Maatkamp's allegations; the state Department of Children and Families is probing whether Nation Christian was boarding students without the proper license.

TCPalm's investigation, which began last year after a video of Woodbury angrily berating a Haitian student-athlete at Nation Christian went viral, has raised questions of child welfare, education, immigration, public funding of private schools, a lack of state oversight and Woodbury’s violent criminal history.

The school still faces several lawsuits. And though it officially dissolved April 8, it's pretty clear the story is far from over.

It’s a curious model for a non-profit Christian school, populating the student body with international kids supplied by an agent who reports how much the child’s family is willing to spend on the education.

But apparently it's common for international student athletes to be recruited/represented by agents, who arrange for the kid to come to the U.S. ostensibly to go to school — but really to try and become star athletes.

Those athletes land at prep schools, most of them reputable. But in 2012, the federal Government Accountability Office rebuked ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, for lack of oversight of schools that issue I-20 forms, which allow student-athletes to apply for a non-immigrant visa to study in the U.S.

Unscrupulous operators can then dangle those visas over the student's head, threatening to yank it if they complain to the authorities.

Last July, a North Carolina woman who founded a basketball academy pleaded guilty to human trafficking after federal authorities said she made $75,000 by hiding 75 foreign student-athletes in the country illegally.

In South Carolina, the founder of a basketball academy pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit visa fraud after foreign student athletes were found living in “marginal” conditions and the founder was accused of lying in order to obtain a U.S. visa.

Maybe federal immigration officials should take a more systemic approach rather than playing whack-a-mole, as is now the case.

And the state of Florida has the power to do more, though too often the state merely reacts to complaints rather than ensuring private schools are complying with state laws.

How are parents and student-athletes half a world away to know that these faraway prep schools will deliver on promises made?

It's not like a Dutch kid can swing by Port St. Lucie for a campus visit before agreeing to attend.

Misunderstandings will always happen. And as Mike Woodbury insists, maybe Nation Christian did nothing wrong.

But clearly, it's too easy for kids with stars in their eyes to be exploited. And that needs to change.

930,Family files claim: Daughter was sent lewd photos by now-former firefighter,"Nicholas Macchiarolo has taken a plea deal after he was accused of sending pictures of his genitalia to a 16-year-old girl. (Photo: File)

The family of a teenage girl who was sent lewd photos by a Marco Island firefighter has filed a notice of claim against the city and its fire department.

A letter from the Law Office of Roca & Linares announced the intent to pursue a claim for injuries and damages resulting from negligence and the actions of former Marco Island firefighter Nicholas Macchiarolo, who pleaded no contest nearly two months ago to a third-degree felony charge of unlawfully using a two-way communication device to facilitate or commission a felony.

The notice of claim is the first step in pursuing a lawsuit against a governmental entity in Florida. A lawsuit can proceed six months after the claim is submitted.

More: Marco firefighter takes plea for sending lewd photos to teen

More: Marco firefighter who took plea has been terminated

As part of the plea deal, two counts of transmission of harmful material to a minor and one count of obscene use of a computer to seduce, solicit or lure a child were dropped. Macchiarolo, 27, was sentenced to three years of state probation, no contact with the victim or the victim’s family and the requirement of a psychosexual evaluation. He was also assessed fines and fees adding up $2,789.

The Collier County Sheriff's Office arrested Macchiarolo in May 2018 after the girl's mother contacted authorities about fears that her daughter was engaging in sexual activity.

In an interview with detectives, the girl told them that she had known Macchiarolo for years and only recently had their conversations turned sexual. Detectives learned that Macchiarolo had sent at least two pictures of his genitalia to the girl, who was 16-years-old at the time, in addition to talking about sex acts.

Macchiarolo admitted to detectives during an interview May 4 at the Marco Island Fire Department that he sent the photos and had sexually-charged conversations on Snapchat and Facebook Messenger, according to the arrest report. Macchiarolo, however, said that he believed she was 21-years-old at the time of the incidents.

One week after taking the plea deal, the Fire Department terminated Macchiarolo.

“Marco Island Fire-Rescue Department takes very seriously the conduct of its employees,” Fire-Rescue Chief Mike Murphy wrote in a prepared statement. “FF/EMT Macchiarolo has been given written notice of termination effective immediately. The actions and admission of by FF/EMT Macchiarolo are not consistent with the integrity, trustworthiness and decorum expected of a Firefighter of the City of Marco Island.”

The notice letter to the city also indicates that the family's attorneys are also investigating ""the existence of any additional parties who may have involvement in the subject incident.""

This is also not the first time in recent years that the city has been put on notice regarding potential litigation.

Last year, the woman involved in the police department's sex on duty scandal also filed a notice of claim for damages that resulted from the negligence in the hiring, supervision and retention of officers.

The incidents involving the police department resulted in two officers, Sgts. James Inlow and Neil Giansanti, resigning while under investigation and a third officer, Kevin Hennings, being terminated for engaging in sex acts while on the clock.

A fourth officer, Brian Granneman, received a reprimand for knowing of Inlow's actions but not reporting it to another supervisor. Granneman was promoted months later to a supervisory position.

931,It's about love,"A 57-year-old Ohio woman who visited Daytona Beach this month says she's been walking since the year 2000 to help the homeless.

DAYTONA BEACH — One day back in 1999, Kim Denmark crossed paths with a homeless man begging for money.

The single mother of four, who had finally reached a place of financial security after years of struggling, reacted with disgust at a man she saw as a lazy panhandler. She threw some change at him and kept walking.

It was an encounter she probably would have forgotten in a few years if it hadn't turned her whole life upside down.

The chance meeting redefined who she is, and she has spent the past 20 years walking from state to state to help impoverished and homeless people. The Ohio woman has spread that help across 16 states, and she just spent the past few weeks trekking through Volusia County.

During the two weeks she was in Daytona Beach, she made herself a one-woman parade along Ridgewood Avenue. Wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and carrying an American flag that's almost as long as she is tall, she was impossible to miss.

She also slings a contraption over her shoulders that holds large signs on her front and back in place, signs that say she's walking across America for homelessness, poverty and homeless veterans. She said it's a calling from God, and she won't stop walking until she's traversed every state and created several comprehensive homeless assistance centers.

""This isn't about me,"" Denmark said.

The beginning of Denmark's story is ordinary. She had spent most of her life in Ohio, and her 20s and early 30s were about raising her kids and worrying about paying bills. She didn't have a career so much as a series of jobs, including a tedious position with the U.S. Postal Service she held for six years.

Then she hit on something that started to fill her savings account. Around 1993, she launched a business helping people find jobs that she ran out of her apartment. Eventually she made enough money to buy a home. Then she was able to move her business into an office and hire a secretary.

In late fall of 1999, when she was riding on the crest of the business she had built, she happened upon the man asking for money in her Dayton, Ohio neighborhood.

'A second chance'

""I was very successful, but I was very nasty,"" Denmark said. ""I was very arrogant because my business made it. Instead of helping and giving back, I chose to put it all on my back and bought elaborate clothes and expensive cars. It was all about Kim.""

A day or two after she threw loose change at the man, who she later found out was a homeless veteran, she became ill. Denmark didn't want to elaborate on what was ailing her and just said she had a medical condition that lingered for about a month.

""The Lord convicted me for that one behavior,"" Denmark said. ""I was on my back.""

While she was sick, she said God talked to her.

""All he said was the people I abused and stepped on and ignored were not mine, but were his and I would now walk for those people,"" she said.

Then she said she was completely healed.

""I began to cry and reach for something I never saw before, and that was a higher power,"" she said. ""He gave me a second chance.""

Just 24 hours after her spiritual epiphany, she said she left her ""beautiful home and the cars."" She tells a dramatic story of venturing out into the cold on Jan. 5, 2000, and falling in the snow over and over as she tried to walk.

""The Lord told me, 'walk and let the people know I love them,'"" she said.

In the years since, she said she has walked 5,460 miles and lost 70 pounds trudging across Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Florida.

Although she's approaching her 58th birthday, she said she still intends to walk through every state. She's headed north toward Jacksonville now, and then plans to turn west and go to California. She hopes to be on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" in December, but conceded she is not a booked guest.

It's about love

When asked what she did with her home, cars, business and kids when she started walking more than 19 years ago, she resisted providing an explanation. She did say her children joined her on the road at some point and she home-schooled them with an internet program. Her kids are all in their 30s now and have children of their own.

As for how she gets from state to state and survives, she said she travels with a security truck that's stocked with water, clothes, shoes, blankets, batteries and even oxygen and snake antivenom. When she gets to a destination, she finds a local volunteer who agrees to go to the security truck and drive it to where she winds up after a day's walk. She said she leaves an orange ribbon tied around a sign pole or something else to mark where she needs to start walking the next day.

She survives off donations of cash, food, water and free hotel stays.

""My needs are met,"" she said. ""Sometimes I have $8 left, and then someone pays my phone bill.""

She said parishioners at a South Carolina church donated more than $7,700 for her after she told her story there, but church leaders wouldn't give her the money when she told them she didn't have a nonprofit agency set up.

She said she had attorneys set up a nonprofit for her in 2016. She said it's based in Atlanta and run out of a home, where her mail is sent. She said the nonprofit hasn't raised any money yet for the homeless centers she wants to build, and she lives ""day to day.""

When asked for specifics about her route and timeline over the years, she explained the walking has not been constant. She's taken breaks for weeks or months to get temporary jobs, raise money and recharge.

For the past few years she's been walking the perimeter of Florida, moving south from the Gulf Coast and around to the East Coast.

She said ultimately it's not about the walking. The walking is the billboard she uses to get attention, donations and connections to help impoverished and struggling people.

""My walk across America is about love,"" Denmark said.

A brochure she hands out says she's trying to collect 1 million signatures from people across the country who agree homelessness in the United States needs immediate attention. She'd then like to take the 1-million-signature petition to Washington, D.C., and speak on the floor of the U.S Senate.

'The Lord puts me in places'

""I can't wait to get to the beauty of this journey,"" she said. ""It's not about Kim anymore. When you help a person, it's wonderful.""

She said about seven years ago she helped a 24-year-old woman in New Jersey who was living in a car with three small children. Denmark said she was in a Walmart parking lot when she spotted the car, talked to the woman and helped her get an apartment.

""I wasn't there by accident,"" Denmark said. ""The Lord puts me in places where people are in trouble.""

Denmark said she's helped more than 600 people since her walking started in January 2000. And plenty of people who helped Denmark made that possible.

Bob Davis, president and CEO of the Lodging & Hospitality Association of Volusia County, said Denmark called him about a month ago and said she wanted to come to Daytona Beach. Davis lined her up with free stays at the Hampton Inn hotel across from Volusia Mall and the Sun Viking Lodge on the ocean for much of the two weeks she was in Daytona Beach.

Denmark also got some help from Pam Jenkins, an Ormond Beach retiree she happened to meet in a local store. Jenkins bought Denmark a dress and shoes, covered her hotel bill for one night and invited Denmark to stay in her home another night.

Asked why she was moved to help a stranger, Jenkins said, ""It was just her smile, her presence.""

""I enjoyed her presence so much,"" said Jenkins, an artist. ""It just reminded me what real love is about.""

Jenkins said she has been very ""impressed"" by Jenkins.

""There's a few people you see and say, 'how can I be like that?' "" Jenkins said. ""We've tried to help her as much as we could.""

Denmark attended several local events during her stay in Daytona Beach, including the ribbon-cutting of the new Bone Fish Grill restaurant on International Speedway Boulevard and the April 12 Florida African American Student Association march that drew 100 college students from around the state. At the restaurant ribbon-cutting, Davis said Denmark ""ran up to me and said I owe you so much.""

Mayor Derrick Henry met Denmark at the student march, and he invited her to tell her story at the April 17 City Commission meeting. Henry read a proclamation in Denmark's honor and gave her a key to the city at the meeting.

The mayor said her cause is the same one so many local leaders have embraced: helping the homeless. [ALSO READ: Daytona homeless shelter struggling with fundraising]

""I'm supportive of anyone who raises awareness,"" Henry said.

Denmark did raise some awareness during her stay. As she walked Ridgewood Avenue one afternoon last week, every few steps she took someone was giving her a thumbs up or stopping to talk to her. One man in a pickup truck stopped at a red light waved her over to give her cash and a hug.

She said several people pulled over to give her food and water while she was in the Daytona Beach area. She also tries to help others as she walks, and she found plenty of opportunities along Ridgewood Avenue where there's a concentration of homeless and impoverished people.

She said she met a 19-year-old man who was kicked out by his parents and tried to convince him to enroll at Daytona State College, which has a program to help homeless students.

She also met Corey Keleher, who was walking in the same area and told Denmark he helps homeless people as well. The two talked a while and then high-fived one another before moving on in opposite directions along the sidewalk.

Denmark said she hopes her high-visibility walks help homeless people and help everyone else better understand those living on the streets.

""When you see a homeless person or a vet, do not judge,"" Denmark said. ""They're human and somebody's relative.""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190429/its-about-love?rssfeed=true,2019-04-29T04:40:05Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117
932,SLICE OF SARASOTA: The graceful lace that trims our trees,"With Spanish moss, you can have too much of a really good thing

The other day after a hard rain, I was sitting on my front porch enjoying the freshly rinsed air, a glass of crisp wine, and a hilariously trashy book by the woman who made boatloads of money writing all those ""Shades of Grey"" best-sellers.

With so much going on, I wasn't paying attention when what looked and sounded like a human body fell onto my front yard with a whispery whump.

Peering over the porch wall, I saw a damp tangle on the sidewalk that was indeed the size of a man, but instead of flesh and bone it was moss and broken branches. My first thought was relief that nobody was walking by when this bundle tumbled. My second was to wonder whether the weight of a huge, wet moss clump could actually bring down a limb of our ancient live oak.

Well, yes, it can. But it's not the fault of the moss.

The Spanish didn't discover this marvelous epiphyte. According to the book I'm reading now, ""The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea,"" by Jack E. Davis -- a much more edifying choice than that other one -- the Calusa were twisting moss and palm fibers into fishing nets before those conquistadors even started sniffing around Florida. The name descends from an insult the French explorers lobbed at the Spanish, to mock their scraggly beards. The Spaniards attempted a riposte, but everybody knows the French are superior at ridicule, so their words stuck.

Well-placed swags of Spanish moss give trees such an aesthetically pleasing vertical element that they tend to look naked without it. In springtime, its venerable gray adds a profound accent to tender green growth, especially on a cypress. And in summer, just when you think there's not a breath of air to be had, delicate stirrings of the moss make a lush promise that the afternoon rains are near.

Moss doesn't hurt trees; it beautifies them. But heavy moss accumulating faster than leaves can be a sign that your tree is in decline. And ""be aware,"" warns the University of Florida, ""that the moss can also weigh down and sometimes break branches.""

933,New Georgia laws expand internet; protect Confederate monuments,"ATLANTA - Georgia is expanding internet access to rural areas and making it harder to relocate Confederate monuments under several bills Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law this week.

Kemp formally approved the broadband legislation in Dahlonega — a region in North Georgia where residents have struggled with connectivity issues, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

“We’ve moved the needle on broadband access in rural Georgia,” he said. “We have more to do, but it’s a great step in the right direction.”

One bill would allow the state’s 42 electronic membership corporations to sell internet services, in addition to the power they already provide. Another allows telephone cooperatives to offer internet services. A third lets telecom firms set up 5G technology equipment on public land.

Kemp also signed the Confederate monuments bill Friday. The measure will fine those convicted of vandalizing monuments up to three times the cost of the damage, as well as legal fees and expenses for repairing or replacing the monument.

The legislation came about partly in response to failed proposals that would have allowed local governments to remove Confederate monuments.

Pressure has been mounting for decades to take down monuments honoring the Confederacy. It intensified after a speeding car killed a woman and injured dozens in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, 2017. The vehicle plowed into a crowd of counterprotesters at a rally of white supremacists who were protesting the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

Confederate monuments at public parks, county courthouses and college campuses across the nation were removed almost daily for weeks afterward.

In addition to Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia have laws protecting Confederate monuments.

934,"Sheriff: Shooting at California synagogue leaves 1 dead, 3 injured","- A shooting at a synagogue outside San Diego where worshippers were celebrating the last day of Passover killed 1 woman and injured 3 people Saturday, but the extent of those injuries was unclear, officials said.

There was no known threat after a man was detained in the shooting at the Chabad of Poway, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship as a precaution, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said.

The shooting came exactly six months since a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue killed 11 people in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.

Officials say San Diego County deputies were called just before 11:30 a.m. Four patients were admitted to Palomar Health Medical Center Hospital around 12:30 p.m., spokesman Derryl Acosta said.

A juvenile female and two adult males are in stable condition, but the sheriff said an older woman died as a result of her injuries at the hospital.

935,Florida deputy forms special bond with baby whose life he saved,"OCALA, Fla. (WESH) — Kingston Crowell and Marion County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremie Nix have a strong bond.

From the toddler's first birthday in January to frequent play dates and visiting on Christmas, Kingston has been part of the family to Jeremie Nix and his wife Nikki for the past year, ever since the deputy helped save his life.

When Kingston stopped breathing on May 9, 2018, his frantic mother and her sister pulled over and flagged down the deputy.

He was captured on dashcam video doing CPR, but when that didn't work, he rushed the baby to Ocala Regional, where doctors revived the child.

""I think it was a God thing. I think it was the right place, right time and being put in that position for the right reason,"" Jeremie Nix said.

""I remember dropping to my knees and just screaming, 'Thank godGod!' I could breathe!"" Nechole Crowell, Kingston's mother, said.

Months later, Crowell asked the Jeremie and Nikki Nix to be Kingston's godparents, and the two families adopted one another.

""Like we were kind of attached from the moment it happened. He just said, 'I'm not leaving your son, until I know he's OK' and it's just been him and Nikki since,"" Crowell said.

But over time, the union forged by a life-threatening emergency on the side of the road has evolved into something unexpectedly special.

Kingston's fight for survival has spawned a relationship that's changing culture in both families: a woman seeing past the uniform to a hero, and a cop understanding the struggles of a single mother working full-time and earning a nursing degree.

""So, it's opened a door to have conversations and create new relationships and friends that we would have never had before,"" Jeremie Nix said.

""It doesn't have to be blood related to be family and it doesn't have to be just your family to teach life lessons,"" Crowell said. ""And so he has another family that can teach him a lot more and we can all work together. You know, no matter color, race, whatever, it's just, you see genuine love.""

""God's got a great plan for Kingston and he's got great things in store for that little guy that we were able to set on the right path that day,"" Jeremie Nix said.",http://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-deputy-forms-special-bond-with-baby-whose-life-he-saved/1959545091,2019-04-27T20:54:19Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

943,Orlando Lyft driver sentenced to 13 years in prison for sex attack on passenger,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - A Lyft driver who sexually attacked one of his customers was sentenced Friday to 13 years in prison.

David Glen McNeill, 62, was convicted last year for the attack that happened in March 2017.

On Friday, the victim gave testimony ahead of the sentencing.

""I hope every day that you are behind bars, you think of me and that moment of weakness you used to take advantage of me has only made me stronger,"" the victim said.

Police said McNeill picked up the woman around 3:30 a.m. and two hours later she was partially naked as officers woke her up in the back of his SUV.

Neighbors who called police told investigators, ""The man repeatedly walked around his vehicle in an odd manner. The man entered the back seat and closed the door. He was there for approximately 30 minutes.""

Detectives said they later found pictures taken of the woman in the back seat of McNeill's SUV on his cellphone.

Four months later, McNeill was arrested after investigators made a DNA match. He was charged with sexual battery and giving false information to law enforcement officers.

The victim later filed a civil lawsuit, which claimed Lyft and McNeill were both negligent.

Then, detectives said Belcher intentionally crossed over three lanes and struck the passenger with her vehicle. She fled, they said. The victim was transported to Tampa General Hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Belcher was later located on Mango Road just north of Hillsborough Avenue East. Deputies said she showed signs of impairment and provided breath samples. Her BAC levels were 0.219 and 0.210. The legal limit in Florida is 0.08.

She was arrested on several charges including DUI, leaving the scene of a crash and aggravated battery.

958,"Woodbury says he did nothing wrong, but questions about 'The Nation' remain","Buy Photo The Nation Christian Academy on Thursday (Photo: Will Greenlee)

Mike Woodbury hasn't talked to TCPalm in weeks, so I was surprised Monday morning when he returned my call.

I'd asked the CEO of The Nation Christian Academy, which dissolved earlier this month, for his reaction to the latest installment of TCPalm's ongoing investigation. That story focused on Jordi Maatkamp, 18, who came from the Netherlands to play soccer at Nation Christian, only to find out the school didn't have a soccer team.

Maatkamp left after four months — and after his folks had spent $10,000 — believing he'd been sold a bill of goods. But Woodbury said he and Nation Christian did nothing wrong; he never told Maatkamp the school had a soccer team.

More: Nation Christian shuts down

“We didn’t recruit him,” said Woodbury, “he came to us through an agency; our contact said ‘Hey, we have a soccer player who’s willing to pay $15,000.’ ”

That’s often how it works, Woodbury said. Agents will contact him, representing a student-athlete looking for a place to play where they have a shot at a college scholarship — and maybe more.

Jordi Maatkamp (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO FROM ESTHER VAN DER REE-MAATKAMP)

Woodbury insists he never promised Maatkamp a college scholarship, though he conceded the agent might have.

He said the reason the Dutch teen didn't last was because he had academic problems.

Homeland Security may have the last word on that.

The agency is reportedly investigating Maatkamp's allegations; the state Department of Children and Families is probing whether Nation Christian was boarding students without the proper license.

TCPalm's investigation, which began last year after a video of Woodbury angrily berating a Haitian student-athlete at Nation Christian went viral, has raised questions of child welfare, education, immigration, public funding of private schools, a lack of state oversight and Woodbury’s violent criminal history.

The school still faces several lawsuits. And though it officially dissolved April 8, it's pretty clear the story is far from over.

It’s a curious model for a non-profit Christian school, populating the student body with international kids supplied by an agent who reports how much the child’s family is willing to spend on the education.

But apparently it's common for international student athletes to be recruited/represented by agents, who arrange for the kid to come to the U.S. ostensibly to go to school — but really to try and become star athletes.

Those athletes land at prep schools, most of them reputable. But in 2012, the federal Government Accountability Office rebuked ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, for lack of oversight of schools that issue I-20 forms, which allow student-athletes to apply for a non-immigrant visa to study in the U.S.

Unscrupulous operators can then dangle those visas over the student's head, threatening to yank it if they complain to the authorities.

Last July, a North Carolina woman who founded a basketball academy pleaded guilty to human trafficking after federal authorities said she made $75,000 by hiding 75 foreign student-athletes in the country illegally.

In South Carolina, the founder of a basketball academy pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit visa fraud after foreign student athletes were found living in “marginal” conditions and the founder was accused of lying in order to obtain a U.S. visa.

Maybe federal immigration officials should take a more systemic approach rather than playing whack-a-mole, as is now the case.

And the state of Florida has the power to do more, though too often the state merely reacts to complaints rather than ensuring private schools are complying with state laws.

How are parents and student-athletes half a world away to know that these faraway prep schools will deliver on promises made?

It's not like a Dutch kid can swing by Port St. Lucie for a campus visit before agreeing to attend.

Misunderstandings will always happen. And as Mike Woodbury insists, maybe Nation Christian did nothing wrong.

But clearly, it's too easy for kids with stars in their eyes to be exploited. And that needs to change.

959,"Rabbi's hands are shattered in fatal attack on Calif. synagogue, says gun 'miraculously' jammed","- In the minutes after the gunman fled the scene of a shooting that killed a woman inside a Southern California synagogue, a wounded Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein wrapped his bloodied hand in a prayer shawl, stood on a chair and addressed the panicked congregation, vowing to stay strong in the face of the deadly attack targeting his community.

""We are a Jewish nation that will stand tall. We will not let anyone take us down. Terrorism like this will not take us down,"" Goldstein recalled telling his congregants after the gunfire erupted Saturday at Chabad of Poway.

Congregant Lori Kaye, 60, was killed in the shooting, which injured Goldstein, 8-year-old Noya Dahan and her 34-year-old uncle, Almog Peretz, authorities said. Hours after the three wounded were released from hospitals, Goldstein described the onslaught at a news conference Sunday outside the synagogue north of San Diego.

Goldstein said he was preparing for a service on the last day of Passover, a holiday celebrating freedom, and heard a loud sound. He turned around, and a saw a young man wearing sunglasses standing in front of him with a rifle.

""I couldn't see his eyes. I couldn't see his soul,"" Goldstein said. He raised his hands and lost one of his fingers in the shooting.

And then, Goldstein said, ""miraculously the gun jammed.""

The attack Saturday came exactly six months after a mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue.

John T. Earnest, 19, surrendered to police after bursting into the synagogue and opening fire as about 100 people were worshipping inside.

Earnest, who had no previous contact with law enforcement, may face a hate crime charge in addition to homicide charges when he's arraigned later this week, San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said. He was being held without bail, and it was unclear if he had an attorney. Police searched Earnest's house and said he was also being investigated in connection with an arson attack on a mosque in nearby Escondido, California, on March 24.

The 8-year-old victim said she had just finished praying and was getting ready to go play with other children when gunshots rang out. Her uncle rushed her and the other children outside, the girl said.

Her leg was bleeding but doctors told her she didn't need surgery, she said.

""I was scared, really, really scared,"" she said. ""I didn't see my dad. I thought he was dead.""

Her father, 32-year-old Israel Dahan, said he flipped over a folding table as soon as he saw the man enter carrying a long rifle and told people to run. He went to look for his children and found two had been ushered out and his 5-year-old was hiding in the bathroom, he said.

There were indications an AR-type assault weapon might have malfunctioned after the gunman fired numerous rounds inside, Gore said. An off-duty Border Patrol agent fired at the shooter as he fled, missing him but striking his getaway vehicle, the sheriff said.

Shortly after fleeing, Earnest called 911 to report the shooting, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said. When an officer reached him on a roadway, ""the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" he said.

Friends described Kaye as giving, warm and attentive to community members on their birthdays and when they were sick. A wife and mother, she loved gardening and made delicious challah for her family and friends, said Roneet Lev, 55.

Goldstein described her as a pioneering founding member of the congregation and said he was heartbroken by her death. He said the attack could have harmed many more people had the shooter turned toward the sanctuary where so many were praying.

""Lori took the bullet for all of us,"" the rabbi said, his hands wrapped in bandages. ""She didn't deserve to die.""

He said that Kaye's physician husband was called to tend to a wounded worshipper and fainted when he realized it was his wife.

When the gunfire erupted, another worshipper, Shimon Abitbul, said he immediately placed his 2-year-old grandson on the floor and waited for a break in the shooting to grab the boy and sprint away.

Then Abitbul ran back to the shooting scene to try to help a woman he described as having a hole in her chest and who later died, he said Sunday.

Abitbul, who was visiting from Israel and staying with his daughter and her family in Southern California, said he was still coming to grips with the carnage.

""All of us are human beings,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter if you are Jews or Christians or Muslims.""

Peretz, who was wounded in the leg, said he turned around after hearing gunfire and saw the shooter standing by the door. He grabbed his niece by the hand and carried out another child.

He then saw a group of children and got them running, ""I tell them, 'go this way, go this way,"" said Peretz, who is visiting from Israel.

Gore said authorities were reviewing Earnest's social media posts, including what he described as a ""manifesto."" There was no known threat after Earnest was arrested, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship Saturday and again on Sunday as a precaution, police said.

A person identifying himself as John Earnest posted an anti-Jewish screed online about an hour before the attack. The poster described himself as a nursing school student and praised the suspects accused of carrying out deadly attacks on mosques in New Zealand last month that killed 50 and at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, in which 11 people were killed.

""It was a hate crime, no doubt about it,"" national security adviser John Bolton said on ""Fox News Sunday."" He said investigators have not seen any connection between the suspect and other extremist groups.

California State University, San Marcos, confirmed that Earnest was a student who was on the dean's list and said the school was ""dismayed and disheartened"" that he was suspected in ""this despicable act.""""

Goldstein said President Donald Trump called him to share condolences on behalf of the American people.

The White House acknowledged the call. ""The President expressed his love for the Jewish people and the entire community of Poway,"" Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement.

Several dozen people, many wearing black, gathered on a street corner in Poway Sunday to show their support for the victims and congregation and to call for an end to hate and violence.

They carried signs reading ""no more killing"" and ""Shalom."" A young boy sat with a cardboard sign reading ""we must do better"".

Deb Lira, 71, of San Diego, said she was angry and sickened by the attack in what has long been a peaceful community.

""I'm here because I'm Jewish and this is my message,"" she said, pointing to a sign that read ""never again"" and ""never forget.""

""I will not be silent,"" she said.

962,FSU concludes 50 Years of Women's Athletics Celebration at Garnet and Golden Finale,"FSU announced that it had raised more than $7 million exclusively towards women's athletics at Saturday's Garnet and Golden Finale. (Photo: Ryals Lee, Jr./FSU Athletic Department.)

The stars have aligned this year.

That's a phrase Vanessa Fuchs -- Florida State Senior Associate Athletics Director and Senior Woman Administrator -- said multiple times Saturday.

It's also quite true. In the same year FSU celebrated its 50th anniversary of women's intercollegiate athletics, the school has seen a string of impressive results across its women's sports teams.

The culmination of that year-long celebration of women's athletics at FSU was the Garnet and Golden Finale held at the Tucker Civic Center Saturday afternoon.

""It's been over two years of discussion and planning that has gone into this celebratory year. I'm really proud of that. I think Florida State has really blown it out to honor and create some recognition and awareness of the achievements of our women's sports programs compared to other schools nationally,"" Fuchs told the Democrat.

""Our women have made it an incredible year just with the sheer success alone. It's been a lot of fun to be involved with it, especially being a former student-athlete and alum myself.""

Former FSU Athletic Director Stan Wilcox announced the anniversary celebration at the National Championship Celebration for the FSU softball team last June.

The FSU soccer team added another title when it defeated North Carolina 1-0 to win the second NCAA Championship in program history.

As things currently stand, all five FSU women's spring sports (softball, beach volleyball, golf, tennis and track and field) currently sit in the Top 10 of their respective national polls.

""There's a real possibility our spring sports can bring home another trophy and kind of close out the year for us,"" Fuchs said.

""It's been exceptional and, again, I'm just so proud of our female student-athletes for what they've been able to accomplish this year.""

(Photo: Ryals Lee, Jr./FSU Athletic Department.)

This on-field success has played a major role in the off-field success FSU has found in this year's fundraising effort.

FSU announced as part of its $100 million Unconquered Campaign in September that it was aiming to raise $5 million which would go exclusively towards women's athletics.

At Saturday's event, FSU announced that it has raised nearly 50 percent over this goal, bringing in a total of $7,204,931 towards women's athletics. This is the most money FSU has ever raised in a single year for women's athletics.

""This is a special campaign that has meant a lot to this university and our student-athletes who are sitting out there. The success of the campaign underscores my belief that there are very, very few schools, if any in the country, where the history of women's intercollegiate athletics is beloved like it is at Florida State University,"" FSU President John Thrasher said when addressing the crowd at Saturday's event.

""It's been wonderful to reflect on our wonderful tradition of women's sports dating back to the days when the Florida State College for Women was here. Those early days really laid the groundwork for Florida State to become one of the first schools to fully support women's intercollegiate athletics in the modern era.""

That dedication is what convinced FSU beach volleyball coach Brooke Niles -- who co-hosted the event with sophomore beach volleyball player Madison Fitzpatrick -- to move across the country from California to take the job in Tallahassee.

""I didn't want to go to a program that was just adding a women's sport to have a women's sport. I wanted a program that cared about if we won, cared about how we treat our athletes, cared about putting time and energy into the program,"" Niles said.

""That's the one thing that when I came on my interview I really felt here.""

An impressive group of notable women who were the pioneers of intercollegiate women's athletics at FSU were in attendance Saturday.

So were a number of current FSU coaches and players, who have been able to learn from these trailblazers as each team has thrown a reunion this year as part of the anniversary celebration.

""I learned so much about our history being involved to the level that I was with our planning committee and learning from some of our pioneers what it was like in the late 60s, 70s when our intercollegiate women's programs were first starting,"" Fuchs said.

""That'll stick with me for a lifetime, being able to learn firsthand from some of the women that were there at the beginning. It's pretty special.""

One of the main pioneers in attendance was Dr. Billie Jones. Jones coached the FSU volleyball team in 1970 and 1972 through 1975 and softball in 1971 and 1972 through 1974 before dedicating herself as a full-time professor at FSU.

She expressed praise for how far the department has come since her days as a coach during the early days of Title IX when there was doubt about the future of women's sports at FSU.

""I'm glad they recognized it, I'm glad that it's being celebrated...I'm really pleased for the women, I am pleased for the players. The women athletes have had a wonderful opportunity and they have used what they had,"" Jones said.

""They're exceptional in their skill level and their attitude. You look at the softball team from last spring. Their attitude and their approach captured the hearts of millions. It really did. The soccer team as well. We've been very fortunate.

""I know that last year the athletic department finished in the Top 10 (in the Learfield Director's Cup). Who put them there? The women.""

Each of the seven NCAA and conference championships that FSU women's teams won over the last year were on display at Saturday's event.

As the academic year winds down, FSU has already had one of its better seasons in women's sports in school history.

The Seminoles are currently in second place in the standings for the Capital One Women's Cup -- which awards teams points for Top-10 finishes in all sports -- with 60 points.

With plenty of chances to add to its tally in the spring, FSU has a decent chance to put together its best finish in the Capital One Cup in program history with the previous record standing at 93 points.

""We sure couldn't have picked better timing for the 50th year to roll around,"" Thrasher said.

963,Leaders struggle to make sense of deadly attack on California synagogue,"Advertisement Leaders struggle to make sense of deadly attack on California synagogue Share Shares Copy Link Copy

The rabbi who led a service on the last day of Passover suffered a gunshot wound to his hands and two others endured shrapnel wounds as political, civic and religious leaders across the country struggled to make sense of another fatal attack on a house of worship six months after a mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue.John T. Earnest, 19, surrendered to police after bursting into Chabad of Poway, north of San Diego on Saturday and opening fire with about 100 people inside, killing Lori Kayne, 60, and injuring Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, Noya Dahan, 8, and Almog Peretz, 34, authorities said.Earnest, who had no previous contact with law enforcement, may be charged with a hate crime in addition to homicide, San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said. Earnest is also being investigated in connection with an arson attack on a mosque in nearby Escondido, California, on March 24.“Any time somebody goes into a house of worship and shoots the congregants, in my book, that’s a hate crime,” Poway Mayor Steve Vaus said.There were indications an AR-type assault weapon might have malfunctioned after the gunman fired numerous rounds inside, Gore said. An off-duty Border Patrol agent working as a security guard fired at the shooter as he fled, missing him but striking his getaway vehicle, Gore said.Shortly after fleeing, Earnest called 911 to report the shooting, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said. When an officer reached him on a roadway, “the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,” Nisleit said.Audrey Jacobs, a friend of the slain woman, said on Facebook that Kane was “taking bullets” for the rabbi to save his life and the rabbi continued to give his sermon after being shot.Gore said authorities were reviewing copies of Earnest’s social media posts, including what he described as a “manifesto.”A person identifying themselves as John Earnest posted an anti-Jewish screed online about an hour before the attack. The poster described himself as a nursing school student and praised the suspects accused of carrying out deadly attacks on mosques in New Zealand last month and at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue Oct. 27.California State University, San Marcos, confirmed Earnest was a student on the dean’s list and said the school was “dismayed and disheartened” that he was suspected in “this despicable act.”There was no known threat after Earnest was arrested, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship as a precaution, police said.Minoo Anvari, a member of the synagogue, said her husband was inside during the shooting. She said he called to tell her the shooter was shouting and cursing.She called the shooting “unbelievable” in a peaceful and tight-knit community. “We are strong; you can’t break us,” Anvari said.Rabbi Yonah Fradkin, executive director of Chabad of San Diego County, said that “in the face of senseless hate we commit to live proudly as Jews in this glorious country. We strongly believe that love is exponentially more powerful than hate. We are deeply shaken by the loss of a true woman of valor, Lori Kaye, who lost her life solely for living as a Jew.”Donny Phonea, who lives across the street from the synagogue, turned off his power drill and heard someone shout, “Police!” Then he heard three or four shots.The 38-year-old bank auditor looked over his backyard fence facing the synagogue and saw people hiding behind an electrical box in the parking lot of a neighboring church. At that point, he knew something was “very, very wrong,” went inside and closed his doors and garage.“I’m a little taken aback,” said Phonea, who moved to Poway two weeks ago. “I moved here because safety was a factor. Poway is very safe.”President Donald Trump offered his sympathies Saturday, saying the shooting “looked like a hate crime.”“Our entire nation mourns the loss of life, prays for the wounded and stands in solidarity with the Jewish community,” Trump said later at a rally in Wisconsin. “We forcefully condemn the evils of anti-Semitism and hate, which must be defeated.”Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said he joins the community in grief.“No one should have to fear going to their place of worship, and no one should be targeted for practicing the tenets of their faith,” he said.",https://www.wesh.com/article/shooting-reported-near-san-diego-area-synagogue/27293880,2019-04-28T08:55:00Z,WESH-TV,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789
964,FSC student launches company selling sportswear line,"David Balandi's self-named apparel company combines business with philanthropy. It's mission: Believe, Achieve, Lead, Accomplish, Nourish, Dedicate, Inspire.

LAKELAND — Perhaps someday the name Balandi will be as recognizable in the sportswear realm as Nike, Adidas and Puma.

For now, David Balandi is a Florida Southern College student who has already realized an aspiration formed in eighth grade to create his own business.

Balandi, a native of the African nation of Chad, launched a self-named apparel company two years ago, drawing upon advice from professors in FSC’s Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise. His youth is not the only element that makes the company unusual.

Balandi, 20, also made philanthropy part of his business model. The company includes a separate line, and all proceeds from those sales are devoted to a program that supports orphans in Africa.

Among the 70 products available from Balandi’s online store are a blue T-shirt emblazoned with the word “BELIEVE” below a stylized “B” and women’s tights in black with white letters spelling out “PERSEVERE” on the lower leg.

Using the letters of his last name, Balandi created an acronym that projects his company’s principles: Believe, Achieve, Lead, Accomplish, Nourish, Dedicate, Inspire.

“Our mission is a vision of achieving,” Balandi said, sitting in a conference room at the Becker Business Building on campus. “That’s something I feel very familiar with, and that’s the energy and the motivation that I wanted my company to give off.”

Balandi, who stands 6 feet 3 inches tall, played basketball during his high school days in the West African nation of Burkina Faso. The impetus for his sportswear line arose in the summer of 2017 when he was playing basketball with his older brother, Antonio Balandi, who played last season for Syracuse University.

The brothers noticed that the shorts they wore caused friction on their legs after becoming wet with sweat. David Balandi decided to design a pair of athletic shorts with hemmed bottoms that wouldn’t slide as much during movement.

After having the shorts produced, he asked some Florida Southern basketball players to try them out and got positive reactions. Balandi launched his company and has since expanded into shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts, caps and socks, including products for women.

Every sportswear company needs a distinctive logo, such as Nike’s “swoosh,” and Balandi set out to create an image based on the first letter of his surname. He used various fonts to produce 50 “B’s,” and then he and his brother narrowed their preferences down to a top choice.

The resulting logo is a lower-case “b” with a rounded bottom and a severely shortened ascender, suggesting a stick figure of a cat’s head with only a right ear.

Some of the products bear just the name “Balandi” and/or the logo. Others are printed with such words as “Achieve,” and a purple tank top proclaims “Woman Up.”

Balandi created and operates his company’s website (www.balandi.co), which includes photos of Florida Southern students wearing his products. Balandi said the items are made in Florida, Africa and Asia.

Typical prices are $15 for socks, $20 for caps, $25 for T-shirts and $40 for hoodies.

Balandi, a business administration major scheduled to graduate next fall, said he benefited from concepts he learned in a principals of management course taught by Silviana Falcon, an assistant professor of business administration and health care management.

“Obviously, I’m very proud of him,” Falcon said. “He understands now what a business owner is. It takes a lot of resilience and a lot of work. It’s not for the faint of heart. Running a business in itself is difficult, and then you add the layer of social entrepreneurship and now you’ve made the business endeavor 100 times more complicated.”

Balandi said other FSC professors have provided valuable guidance on accounting and the legal elements of business.

“It’s been really amazing,” he said. “I’m very lucky to be part of a great business school with great faculty members and great students. They have really helped me out in terms of really shaped my vision and shaped what this company means to me.”

After his graduation in December, Balandi plans to run his business out of Catapult, a co-working space in Lakeland geared toward promoting startup ventures.

Balandi has marketed the company through social media, and he enlisted a well-known African comedian, Dulo, to record a commercial. In the spot, the man at first struggles to maintain his balance on inline skates, but after putting on Balandi sportswear he rolls gracefully down the street.

“My balance went from zero to 100 real quick,” Dulo tells the camera.

Though he’ll happily use humor to promote his products, Balandi has a serious purpose for his brand. He spoke of visiting an orphanage in Burkina Faso before starting his company and being shocked to see the children’s lessons were conducted on benches outside.

The company includes the Balandi Kids Program, a nonprofit segment devoted to supporting children in Africa and the United States. Balandi established the $15K Impact program, which aims to raise $15,000 by December for the building of a classroom and library at the Burkina Faso orphanage.

Balandi has a For The Kids line of apparel bearing that phrase and his logo, and he said all receipts from those items go toward the children’s initiative.

Balandi has become active in the Florida Southern chapter of Enactus, a worldwide, college-based nonprofit organization. Along with other Enactus members, he volunteers twice a week at Florida Baptist Children’s Homes in Lakeland.

The students tutor foster children and lead them in social activities. Enactus members have also taken the kids to a Lakeland Magic game and a Florida Southern basketball game, Balandi said.

Falcon serves as faculty advisor to FSC’s Enactus chapter.

“I see in David what I see in a lot of different students, and that is the true desire to help other people through entrepreneurship,” she said. “So that is exciting to see, that this generation is seeing beyond themselves and actually wanting to be part of the solution, and I think Enactus provides that platform.”

The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office arrested 47-year-old Bobbijean Truempy on Thursday.

On Thursday, deputies said Truempy called 911 to report a home invasion at her apartment on Pineapple Tree Drive.



Truempy initially told investigators a black man forced her back into the apartment at gunpoint and made her open a safe where her boyfriend kept a gun. She said the man took the gun. When deputies asked her for more information, they said story kept changing. Truempy's boyfriend called to say she has a drug problem and that she's the only one who knew he kept a gun in the safe, and she's the only one with the code. That's when Truempy admitted to deputies she traded the gun for drugs to a drug dealer named ""Hammer"" in Lake Worth two days ago. According to the arrest report, Truempy said she made up the story so her boyfriend wouldn't get mad at her. He decided to press charges against her.

The sad news comes just a week after the litter was found inside of a closed plastic bag in a Coachella Valley dumpster. The puppy who died is said to be the runt of the litter. The dog's foster believes he was at the bottom of the bag and served as a ""cushion"" to save his siblings.

“As the lady threw them in the bag, I think he was at the bottom and took the hit when all of his siblings landed on him,” Boen Schirm continued. “I gave it everything I had in me, but he never grew. he never recovered. I wanted so much for him to make it and we all were rooting for him.""

(Photo: LANNIS WATERS /AP VIA PALM BEACH POST)

WEST PALM BEACH — A judge Monday granted a protection order preventing the release of videos in the cases of two women arrested in the Orchids of Asia Day Spa investigation in which New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and others are accused of getting sex services.

After hearing from attorneys representing the media, Kraft, prosecution and defendants, Circuit Judge Joseph Marx said he would “piggyback” on County Judge Leonard Hanser’s earlier order that protected the release of videos reportedly depicting Kraft getting sex services on consecutive days in January.

“It’s the only way I’m going to prevent serious and imminent threat to the administration of justice and there are no other alternatives for me, and I’m not changing venue,” Marx said.

Lei Wang (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY MARTIN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE)

Katie Phang, an attorney representing one of the women arrested, Lei Wang, 45, argued in court filings for a protective order on the videos, alleging they were improperly obtained and shouldn’t be disclosed.

Tama Kudman, an attorney representing another woman arrested, Hua Zhang, 58, said she joined Phang.

The case involving Orchids of Asia began being disclosed Feb. 19 at a media briefing at the Martin County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff William Snyder said his agency targeted four spas in Martin County and spoke of the cases in the context of human trafficking.

Hua Zhang (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY PALM BEACH COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE)

Investigators were led to Orchids of Asia in Jupiter, where covert surveillance cameras were installed after investigators got a warrant.

In court filings, attorneys for Wang argued a release would violate Wang’s right to privacy and would make it difficult for her to get a fair trial. They also argued the videos are “medical records” and thus confidential and not allowed for release in a records request.

Dana McElroy, an attorney representing the media, made arguments in opposition.

“We are talking about a First Amendment right to judicial proceedings and to understand what it is that this court rules upon,” McElroy said. “We’re not just talking about a defendant’s right to a fair trial in a vacuum.”

She said the idea that a prostitution business in a strip mall is not of interest to the public and Palm Beach County citizens is “antithetical to an open court system.”

She said whether it was an illicit prostitution business or whether law enforcement overstepped are of great interest to the community. She spoke of narrowing the scope of a protective order.

Phang said there were 41 million results in Google after the state attorney’s office announced an intent to release video.

“Page upon page,” she said. “The instant dissemination worldwide of this information, you cannot put that Jeannie back into the bottle.”

Marx said he would adhere to the conditions that Hanser specified for Kraft’s videos.

Hanser on April 23 entered an order stating the videos should be protected until juries have been sworn in; the case is resolved by plea; the charges are dropped; or at any other time the court determines their release wouldn’t harm Kraft’s right to a fair trial.

In legal filings, Wang’s attorneys also said that because a description of the content of the videos has been disclosed, then “there is nothing to be gained” by the video release.

They argue media interest in the videos “appeals to the prurient interests of certain members of the public, and is intended to advance the discussion concerning the conduct of one of the Johns, Robert Kraft, and his conduct with respect to football players.”

Kraft has pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor counts of soliciting another to commit prostitution.

Wang’s attorneys in filings said the case has gotten more media coverage than possibly “any other misdemeanor prosecution in recent history.”

Meanwhile, attorneys for Kraft on Monday filed for discovery materials, with the exclusion of videos of Kraft at Orchids of Asia Day Spa on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20 and of a traffic stop conducted by Jupiter police on Jan. 19.

Kraft’s attorney’s on Friday began a hearing on a motion to suppress the videos from his case, spending about five hours questioning Jupiter Police Detective Andrew Sharp.

That hearing is expected to continue Tuesday afternoon before Hanser, but it's unclear when it will conclude.

Wang and Zhang also filed a motion to suppress the videos from their criminal cases. Marx set that hearing for May 20, allotting a total of four hours.

But their owners were nowhere to be found.Joe Sweat, a spokesman with the city of Fort Pierce City Manager’s Office told WPBF this is not the first time residents have treated baby animals so cruelly.“Please call our Fort Pierce Animal Control who will gladly come to pick up the animal and relocate them to a shelter without cost,” Sweat said in an email.St. Lucie County Humane Society employees are looking for loving families to adopt the baby girls. “We will spay and neuter them, give them all their vaccines, microchip them,” St. Lucie County Humane Society shelter coordinator Theresa Agosta said.United for Animals’ founder said the situation is very tragic.“In my years of working United for Animals mobile outreach program assisting people and their pets I have seen how ignorance can lead to acts of cruelty!” Parry said.She hopes to find the puppies’ mother.“There are unanswered questions regarding this case and United For Animals is now focused on getting the mother of these pit bull pups spayed as well as getting the word out that there are lots of options and aide for those who need help with their animals,” Parry said in a statement.

Kingston Crowell and Marion County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremie Nix have a strong bond. From the toddler's first birthday in January to frequent play dates and visiting on Christmas, Kingston has been part of the family to Jeremie Nix and his wife Nikki for the past year, ever since the deputy helped save his life.When Kingston stopped breathing on May 9, 2018, his frantic mother and her sister pulled over and flagged down the deputy. He was captured on dashcam video doing CPR, but when that didn't work, he rushed the baby to Ocala Regional, where doctors revived the child.""I think it was a God thing. I think it was the right place, right time and being put in that position for the right reason,"" Jeremie Nix said. ""I remember dropping to my knees and just screaming, 'Thank godGod!' I could breathe!"" Nechole Crowell, Kingston's mother, said.Months later, Crowell asked the Jeremie and Nikki Nix to be Kingston's godparents, and the two families adopted one another.""Like we were kind of attached from the moment it happened. He just said, 'I'm not leaving your son, until I know he's OK' and it's just been him and Nikki since,"" Crowell said.But over time, the union forged by a life-threatening emergency on the side of the road has evolved into something unexpectedly special.Kingston's fight for survival has spawned a relationship that's changing culture in both families: a woman seeing past the uniform to a hero, and a cop understanding the struggles of a single mother working full-time and earning a nursing degree.""So, it's opened a door to have conversations and create new relationships and friends that we would have never had before,"" Jeremie Nix said.""It doesn't have to be blood related to be family and it doesn't have to be just your family to teach life lessons,"" Crowell said. ""And so he has another family that can teach him a lot more and we can all work together. You know, no matter color, race, whatever, it's just, you see genuine love.""""God's got a great plan for Kingston and he's got great things in store for that little guy that we were able to set on the right path that day,"" Jeremie Nix said.",https://www.wesh.com/article/sheriffs-deputy-ocala-woman-form-deep-bond-after-dramatic-rescue-of-choking-baby/27288522,2019-04-26T20:47:00Z,WESH-TV,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA",FL,32789
983,"Lab monkeys get second chance at life, thanks to Florida woman","- Kari Bagnall's Gainesville home has grown into a monkey paradise. The property has primates of all sorts, including marmosets, tamarins and capuchins.

""It's kind of like the rainforest out here, that they would live in naturally,"" she explained.

Kari's a mom of sorts to hundreds of rescued primates. Over half the monkeys at her Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary were brought in from research labs. They were involved in everything from nicotine and cocaine studies to research on vocal cords and cognitive functions.

She says some arrived in rough shape. ""A lot of time when they are in a lab or by themselves, they go mad, they go crazy and they start pulling out their hair.”

Now she gives them the retirement she believes they deserve, a life with all the creature comforts.

Continue reading below

""We want to give them a monkey life and introduce them to other monkeys and do monkey things,” she said.

Twenty-six young squirrel monkeys are her latest arrivals. Kari calls them the FDA Boys. They were part of a Food and Drug Administration nicotine study. It was abruptly cancelled after four monkeys died.

""I was happy that whole study was stopped,"" she offered.

They're adjusting to a far different life at the sanctuary, one where they're being groomed to roam on their own. ""They are still in their lab cages now because we are building for them. We roll them outside, so that they can get used to outside.""

Kari had an interior design career, but her goals shifted in 1992 after she adopted her first orphaned monkey, then another, then dozens more.

Now, her passion has grown to 20 employees and dozens of volunteers.

Some biomedical researchers argue ethically controlled studies on primates are still necessary. Still, primate labs at Harvard and the National Institutes of Health closed, either because of public uproar or alternatives to animal studies.

""Ultimately, I would like to see them out of research. I don't know that I'll see it in my lifetime, but that would be the best,” Kari continued.

Yet, the number of monkeys used in medical research jumped to an all-time high in 2018. ""Most are still being euthanized, but the trend is moving towards retirement, so we're really excited about that.”

984,Knock knock: Gator shows up on Florida woman's doorstep,"Living in Florida means making peace with a few realities – namely, hurricanes, election controversies and, of course, surprising encounters with the native wildlife. It comes with the territory.

But a Palm Coast woman’s recent run-in with an alligator was especially startling because she didn’t have to go far. The unwanted visitor just showed up at her door and wouldn’t take no for an answer.

According to ClickOrlando.com, the episode happened Thursday afternoon as Donna Heiss was getting home. She heard her neighbors warning her to get inside, and it didn’t take her long to figure out why.

Heiss posted two video clips of the encounter on Facebook, saying what all of us would be thinking if we found ourselves in a similar situation: ""Not cool.""

The gator, which measured about seven to eight feet long, can be seen in the video wandering around the porch, knocking on the glass door and even peering through a window at one point.

For Heiss, it was an encounter that was too close for comfort. She told ClickOrlando she was worried that the gator’s knocking might actually shatter the glass. ""It frightened me so much,"" she said.

An animal trapper was called to handle the reptile.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said gators that are four feet long and believed to pose a threat are considered nuisances. If you see a nuisance gator, call 866-392-4286.

987,Minor cut leads to flesh-eating infection on Florida man's hand. Black blisters were sign something was very wrong.,"CLOSE Learn the signs and treatment of the rare disease ""necrotizing fasciitis."" USA TODAY

A Florida man said he is lucky to be alive after a minor prick from a fishing hook led to a life-threatening, flesh-eating bacterial infection.

Fisherman Mike Walton caught his hand in a fishing hook in the Gulf of Mexico days ago, and didn't think much of it, he told Tampa Bay's WFTS. It's an injury he said he's had hundreds of times while fishing.

But, his hand began to swell — with large black blisters. Usual antibiotics weren't working. So, Walton drove himself to an emergency room, where doctors told him he needed surgery or he might lose his arm or worse.

“They said in a few hours, this would have gone up my arm into my chest and I wouldn’t have been here. There was no saving me,” Walton told Florida's FOX 13.

Doctors considered amputating his arm, but were able to remove the bacteria from skin tissue between his elbow and the palm of his hand, he said.

""I got real lucky on this one,"" he told WFTS.

The flesh-eating infection, necrotizing fasciitis, is rare and can be deadly. Bacteria that causes it can enter the body through even small breaks in the skin and spreads quickly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Walton, who works in construction, said this injury won't stop him from fishing in the future.

""I want to go right now,"" he said. ""It ain't going to slow me down. It's one thing I enjoy.""

Doctors told Walton the infection is contained, he said, but he'll likely need to be on antibiotics for another month, and require additional weeks to heal.

Felipe Oquendo, 37, is charged with false imprisonment and possession of drug

paraphernalia in connection with an incident early Friday morning.

Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office deputies were called to the home on Willow Bend

Boulevard around 1:10 a.m. Friday. The caller said Oquendo had started acting erratically and accused her of cheating on him with a man in the mattress.

She claimed Oquendo had stabbed the mattress with a bedpost, then ripped it apart

with his hands. He then locked the bedroom door and refused to let the woman leave, but she was able to escape while he was preoccupied with the mattress, according to an arrest report.

When deputies arrived, Oquendo reportedly told them he had felt the mattress moving. He said had asked his girlfriend to help him figure out what was happening, but had not prevented her from leaving, according to the report.

Oquendo told OCSO deputies he was fighting the man in the mattress, holding him

down when they arrived, but the man then slipped out and left.

He admitted to smoking methamphetamine earlier in the day, and deputies found a glass pipe in his possession they believed was used for narcotics.

Oquendo was taken into custody and booked into Okaloosa County Jail.

994,"Bedridden woman, 10 dogs removed from deplorable Dunedin home","Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

DUNEDIN, Fla. (WFLA) - A welfare check in Dunedin led authorities to a bedridden woman trapped in deplorable conditions plus nearly a dozen neglected and starved dogs, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.

The man tasked with taking care of them, 65 year old Richard Goodwin, is charged with abuse or neglect of an elderly or disabled person and two counts of animal cruelty.

Goodwin was arrested Wednesday night and bonded out of jail as of Thursday. However, he did not come to the door when News Channel 8 stopped by the home on Pinehurst Drive Thursday afternoon.

Neighbors call the case ""sad and sickening.""

""This is a really nice neighborhood, and to know this is going on right next door to you is appalling,"" said Tami Briganti.

Investigators say neither the 67 year old female victim nor the animals appeared to have food or water when they entered the home. Dogs were found in plastic bins, trapped in their own waste. Five large exotic birds were found loose in the home as well.

The victim was transported to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

Pinellas County Animal Services says the birds were not removed from the home but animal services officers removed the ten dogs. Some are puppies, just days old. All are doing okay despite the conditions they came from.

""We don't see (cases) like this everyday, but we see it a lot more frequently than we would like,"" said Pinellas County Animal Services director Doug Brightwell. ""Not an environment that anybody, animal or person, should be living in.""

Goodwin was arrested in May 2018 for neglecting the same woman. Court documents show the home was in just as bad a state then, covered in trash, feces, urine, and dead birds.

""I just would like to see this not ever happen again, for humans and for the animals,"" Tami Briganti said.

Court records show Goodwin is still awaiting trial for the 2018 charges. PCAS director Doug Brightwell says it is legally possible for Goodwin to reclaim the dogs while he waits for these newer charges to play out. However, Brightwell added that PCAS is considering petitioning for custody.

Her mother, Sara Mytnowiecka, filled the basket with family photos — happy memories they made together before Germany’s occupation of Belgium forced Jews into hiding.

Claire spent her childhood frolicking with her aunt in the seaside sand at Blankenberge on Belgium’s northern coast, playing in the wooded Bois de la Cambre park on the outskirts of Brussels, rambling with cousins around a goldfish-filled lake at the lush Jardin Botanique near the Royal Palace and toying with buttons on her father’s tailor shop floor.

Less than a year after Nazis invaded in 1940, that came to an end.

Claire was sent to live with an elderly Catholic couple who could pass her off as their granddaughter, and her close-knit relatives split up among several non-Jewish households.

“By dividing themselves, they felt they gave the children a better chance to survive,” said Claire, 83, of Palm Coast, whose surname is now Soria.

They visited her in secret at first. But one by one, the loved ones in her photos disappeared, snatched up by the Gestapo and shipped to Auschwitz. All she had left was her sewing basket.

‘I could not stop crying’

Claire watched the Nazi troops and tanks parading through the streets of Brussels a few days after her fifth birthday.

Soldiers removed Belgian flags and hoisted the red, white and black Nazi banner in their place. Signs decrying Jews appeared soon after.

“We could never imagine (back) then what was on the horizon,” said Claire. “From one day to the next, everything changed.”

Her parents had to stop going to work, were forbidden from some public places and could only shop during certain hours. Though her youth shielded her from much of the discrimination adults experienced, she sensed a shift.

Her kindergarten friends were afraid to be seen playing with a girl wearing a yellow star, but Claire didn’t understand the correlation.

“I even sewed one on my clothing and didn’t see anything wrong with that,” she said — until her parents realized the stars made it easier for people to report any Jews they knew to the authorities.

“I don’t think in the beginning people had any idea of what was going on,” Claire said. But her parents, fearing arrest, asked their Catholic neighbors to shelter her.

Lambert and Lea Sabaux (pronounced Sa-bow) agreed to take her in and acted as if she were a visiting granddaughter. They loved her like one, too.

Claire’s parents, aunt and cousin Nina visited when they could. They sent her letters and postcards. She stowed them all in her sewing basket.

“That basket has always been paramount to my story,” Claire said. “It’s the one thing I’ve saved my whole life.”

When school was back in session in fall 1941, Jewish children were forbidden to attend.

Grandma and Grandpa, as Claire called her caretakers, thought she’d be safer with a French name. She chose Yvette in honor of one of her lost friends.

The Sabauxes took “Yvette” to a different school to enroll in first grade.

“If this child happens to be Jewish, the Gestapo will come and pick her up,” Claire recalled the principal’s warning. “So we left, and by noon (the Sabauxes) called the school and gave a phony excuse (for me dropping out).”

They found a tutor who would come to their home, but that, too, soon fell through. A teacher visiting each day could attract unwanted Gestapo attention.

A music education was the only option. Lea Sabaux, a former concert pianist, trained Claire to play, and Lambert Sabaux took her along when he played drums at a corner cafe on their street.

Claire was a homebody by nature, so she didn’t mind staying inside. She learned solitaire and spent hours playing card games to pass the time.

Her family’s visits became fewer and eventually stopped all together.

In March 1943, the Gestapo barged into the home where her mother, aunt and uncle were hiding. The three of them were among 1,638 Jews deported on the 20th transport train from Malines, Belgium, to Auschwitz.

Her father was arrested on a streetcar, and shipped out on the 21st train from Malines. Her beloved cousin Nina, then 17, was turned in by a neighbor. She, too, was sent to Auschwitz.

“I could not stop crying,” Claire said. “(I wondered), ‘Who’s next? How much more can I take?’”

Gestapo at the door

Word of an imminent Gestapo raid typically traveled through the Belgian underground resistance network in time for the Sabauxes to whisk Claire to safety in the countryside.

One time the Nazis caught them by surprise.

Claire was asleep upstairs, and her cousins, two sisters ages 7 and 9, had just turned up on the Sabauxes' doorstep seeking shelter.

Knowing they couldn’t care for three children, the Sabauxes took them in anyway. That’s when the Gestapo came knocking.

Lea Sabaux made a show of fumbling with her keys. She knew the cost of collaborating with Jews — they risked being shot or shipped to Auschwitz to join the rest of Claire’s family.

“I can’t open the door,” she called.

The officers moved on to the next house with a warning: “We’ll be back.”

They never returned, and the Sabauxes found Claire’s cousins a new safe house. Both girls survived the war.

Some of the Sabauxes’ neighbors were not so lucky.

“There were times I actually did see the Gestapo going from house to house and pulling people out of their homes and forcing them into trucks,” Claire said. “And if they did not do as they were told, they were shot. I remember that vividly.”

‘They risked their lives’

Claire’s story shares notable similarities with that of Anne Frank, with one distinct difference — Claire survived. But as the war went on, the odds of doing so seemed to diminish.

The Sabauxes lived near a railroad bridge frequently targeted in German airstrikes early in the war and by the Allies near the end of it.

And then there were the “Vengeance” missiles — the low-flying V-1 and the longer-range, deadlier V-2 — that Germany launched toward sites in England and Belgium.

Neither weapon was very accurate, and air raid sirens alerted civilians of incoming missiles that fell short of their targets. Claire learned to distinguish the difference by their sounds.

“Are they going to hit our area or not? You never knew for sure,” Claire said. They huddled in the basement until a second siren signaled it was safe.

“We would come back up and that’s when we could see down the street, up the street, homes demolished,” she said.

Food was rationed, and there wasn’t much.

One night at dinner, Claire’s place at the table was the only one set with food. She realized her caretakers had given her the last of their store and refused to eat alone.

“They said, ‘OK, go to bed, you’ll have it in the morning.’ And I did,” she said. “They were so caring. They just wanted what was best for me.”

The Allies eradicated Nazi forces from Belgium in early 1945, but Belgian towns continued to be a target for Vengeance missiles.

Claire doesn’t have a specific memory associated with the war’s end, but she recalled the trickle of Jews returning to town. “It always gave me hope that next would be my mom and dad,” she said.

But when her cousin Nina was released from Auschwitz, she brought bad news. Claire’s father had been tortured to death and her mother, aunt and uncle all were killed in the camp.

“I remember the day that Nina sat down with me and not only told me that my mom and dad were not coming back, but explained to me the fact that I am Jewish,” Claire said. “That was the beginning of the change in my life.”

Claire spent more than four years with the Sabauxes — and by then was much closer to them than to her surviving family — but the law gave custody of war orphans to adult relatives. Claire had to move in with an aunt.

“I was so upset,” she said. “(Grandma and Grandpa) were so nice to me. They risked their lives to save mine.”

She was permitted to visit them at first, but she would always come home crying. Her aunt stopped letting her see them.

“She did not realize that (my tears were) love,” Claire said.

Her aunt sent her away to summer camp to spend time with children her age, and then, at age 13, to the U.S. She didn’t speak English and was several years behind in school. Those were some of her darkest days, she said.

Claire eventually married and had three children. She has six grandkids and two great-grandchildren.

Grandma’s piano lessons paid off. Claire followed in her footsteps and became a piano teacher. She still has 14 students.

A year after Claire arrived in the U.S., she received correspondence from Lambert Sabaux.

“My dearest Yvette, these few lines are to let you know that it’s been terrible for us since you left. It’s sad to say but Grandma has suddenly gotten very ill,” the letter begins.

Lea Sabaux, hospitalized a few months after Claire’s departure, did not live much longer. Lambert Sabaux passed away soon after that.

“I could almost swear that it’s from a broken heart,” Claire said. She still cries every time she reads the letter.

It continues: “You wrote in your letter that you missed us very much. I know it. But that's life. The only thing I wish for you now is for you to be happy,” Lambert Sabaux wrote. “I must end my letter because I can't stop crying.”

Claire saved the letter in her sewing basket.

'Never forget'

The Holocaust survivors’ rallying cry has long been “never forget.”

As the youngest survivors age into their 70s, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., makes a special effort to preserve firsthand accounts in order to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike.

To honor this week's Days of Remembrance, established by Congress as the nation’s annual Holocaust commemoration, The News-Journal is sharing the individual accounts of four local Holocaust survivors.

Aimee Rubensteen, the museum's acquisitions coordinator, travels South Florida “rescuing the evidence of the Holocaust by speaking to firsthand witnesses,” she said, and collecting their World War II-era photos, letters, newspaper clippings, clothing and other artifacts of historical value.

“These original artifacts will be the things that teach the Holocaust to future generations,” Rubensteen said.

The museum’s mission is to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike and to encourage critical thinking about how and why those atrocities occurred.

Firsthand stories make those larger themes more personal.

“A lot of people don’t know about these specific, individual stories. The more we spread the word and expand the conversation, the better it is for everyone,” Rubensteen said.

Individuals or families who are interested in sharing their Holocaust artifacts or family keepsakes with the museum may contact Rubensteen at 786-496-2788 or arubensteen@ushmm.org to schedule an appointment.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190430/palm-coast-woman-tells-how-neighbors-helped-her-outlast-holocaust?rssfeed=true,2019-04-30T04:24:01Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill. (WTVO) - According to a timeline released Friday by the Illinois Department of Human Services, 5-year-old A.J. Freund told a doctor ""maybe someone hit me with a belt. Maybe mommy didn't mean to hurt me"" after police found a bruise on his hip.

Crystal Lake Police had been called to the home after A.J.'s mother, JoAnn Cunningham, was arrested for driving on a suspended license in December of 2018. Officers noted the home was in deplorable condition: ""the celing was falling down, the floor torn up, and the kids' bedroom smelled of dog urine.""

A.J. allegedly told the DCFS investigator at the time that the bruise had been caused when the family dog pawed at him, but later told an ER doctor that his mother did it.

DCFS released A.J. back into his mother's custody, but asked his father, Andrew Freund, Sr., to remain in the home as a safety precaution

DCFS confirmed that its investigators have been in repeated contact with Andrew's family since he was born with opiates in his system in 2013.

Andrew was taken into DCFS custody and placed into a foster home less than a month after he was born. He was returned to his birth parents in June 2015, DCFS officials said.

Crystal Lake police also have repeatedly been called to the family's house. Officers in police reports described finding filthy living conditions, broken windows, evidence of drug use and the overpowering smell of dog feces.

In 2014, a woman alerted police that the tenants in the family home were using heroin after a she found a syringe on the kitchen floor.

In 2018, neighbors reported saying the house had no power, and was surrounded by grass nearly two feet tall.

After AJ's parents reported him missing, authorities immediately placed his younger brother in the custody of state welfare workers.

Last week, police say his parents forced A.J. into a cold shower and beat him to death. An autopsy revealed the 5-year-old died from blunt force trauma to the head.

Acting Director of DCFS, Marc Smith, released a statement Wednesday, saying, ""After a nearly week-long search for missing Andrew 'A.J.' Freund, law enforcement officials today confirmed his death. This news is heartbreaking. Protecting vulnerable children who come to our attention is at the core of our mission at DCFS. All of us feel this loss. Our priority is the care and safety of Andrew's younger sibling. We will continue to cooperate with law enforcement in their ongoing investigation. The Department is committed to conducting a comprehensive review of the entirety of our work with Andrew's family to understand our shortcomings and to be fully transparent with the public on any steps we are taking to address the issues.""",https://www.wfla.com/news/national/maybe-mommy-didn-t-mean-to-hurt-me-aj-freund-told-doctors-4-months-before-he-was-killed/1959323907,2019-04-27T18:22:04Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

PROSPECT BLUFF — Two hundred years ago, a post overlooking the Apalachicola River housed what historians say was the largest community of freed slaves in North America at the time.

Hurricane Michael has given archaeologists an unprecedented opportunity to study its story, a significant tale of black resistance that ended in bloodshed.

The site, also known as Fort Gadsden, is about 70 miles southwest of Tallahassee in the Apalachicola National Forest near the hamlet of Sumatra.

British lived at Prospect Bluff with allied escaped slaves, called Maroons, who joined the British military in exchange for freedom, along with Seminole, Creek, Miccosukee and Choctaw tribe members.

The Negro Fort, which was built on the site by the British during the War of 1812, became a haven for escaped slaves. Inside, 300 barrels of gunpowder were stored, and defended by both women and men.

Wary of the group of armed former slaves in Spanish Florida living so close to the United States border, U.S. soldiers began to attack. On July 27, 1816, U.S. forces led by Colonel Duncan Clinch ventured down the river and fired a single shot at the fort’s magazine. It exploded, killing 270 escaped slaves and tribes people who were inside. Those who survived were forced back into slavery.

Managed by the U.S. Forest Service, which purchased it in the 1940s, the site has been preserved as a National Historic Landmark and park. Because of that, it was never excavated for artifacts, except in 1963 by Florida State University, mainly to identify structural remains.

“It’s a really intriguing story. There’s so much new ground there that historians of the past never really got into,” said Dale Cox, a Jackson County-based historian.

In an ironic way, Hurricane Michael has changed that — an isolated upside of the devastating storm.

The October Category 5 hurricane caused extensive damage to the site, toppling about 100 trees. Most of the debris has been cleared, but under the remaining massive roots, archaeologists began this month to dig and sift through the soil, uncovering small artifacts and documenting archaeological features revealed by the upturned trees.

The effort is funded by a $15,000 grant awarded from the National Park Service and is in partnership with the Southeast Archaeological Center.

""The easy, low-hanging fruit is European trade ware that dates to that time period. But when you have ceramics that were made by the locals, it's even more unique and special,"" said U.S. Forest Service Archaeologist Rhonda Kimbrough. ""For one thing, there's not much of it, and we don't have a whole lot of historical records other than the European view from what life in these Maroon communities was like.""

So far, Kimbrough and others have found bits of Seminole ceramics, shards of British black glass and gun flint and pipe smoking fragments. They’ve also located the area of a field oven, a large circular ditch that surrounds a fire pit.

The fort was recently inducted into the National Park Service’s Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.

""It’s like connecting the sites, pearls on a string,"" said Kimbrough, ""because these sites, even though they’re spread all over the place, they’re connected by one thing, which is resistance to slavery.""

Historian Cox has been tracking down the former slaves who died at the fort and the descendants of the few who made it out alive, like Polydore, who escaped and was recaptured to work for Andrew Jackson. Cox found his descendants who now live in Louisiana.

It's been a slow process of sifting through Census records, which are private only for 50 years, international archives of Great Britain as well as Spanish archives in Cuba. But Cox is on a quest to name as many as possible.

The people who lived in the Maroon community were very skilled, he said. Many were masons, woodworkers, farmers. They tended the surrounding melon and squash fields, but little is known precisely about their day-to-day lives.

The area has always been ideal for settling, given its higher elevation and clearings amid the river's mostly swampy perimeter, said Andrea Repp, a U.S. Forest Service archaeologist. Prior to European occupation, the site was sacred to natives and was named Achackweithle, which resembles the words for ""standing view"" in Creek, according to the Florida Geological Survey.

Matthew Shack, a Panama City historian, praised the archaeological effort.

Shack, 76, is a descendant of Maroons. His great great grandfather escaped a North Carolina plantation, married a part-Native American woman and settled in Marianna. He remembers his grandmother's stories about the Prospect Bluff community.

""I remember her telling us about the 'Colored Fort' and all the colored folk who died,"" he said. ""A lot of black history wasn't taught. A lot of our history is lost, and some of it we won't get back. I'm glad that there's a renewed interest in capturing the history that I thought was lost.""

1007,Daytona police arrest serial rape suspect linked to 7 attacks,"Markeith Martin, 44, of Daytona Beach, was charged with sexual battery in Aug. 1, 2018 attack. Police hope to charge him in more rapes in Daytona and Holly Hill.

DAYTONA BEACH — A homeless man with a ""horrific criminal history"" and who has been linked to seven rapes in the area was captured Friday by police following a two-day manhunt, Daytona Beach Police Chief Craig Capri said.

Markeith ""Shawn"" Martin, 44, a felon who has been in and out of prison for a decade, admitted to forcibly raping women on the streets of Daytona Beach, Capri said. Martin also has been linked to a rape investigation in Holly Hill, according to police.

[READ MORE: Deputies: Woman attacked, raped on beach near Daytona Beach Shores]

""We hit the streets looking for him (Wednesday) and we were able to track him down today,"" Capri said.

Martin was convicted in 2015 on a charge of aggravated battery with intent to harm, for which he was sentenced to 37 months in prison. Martin originally was charged with sexual battery in that case when he was arrested in July 2014. Capri referred to that incident during a media conference Friday.

""The victim is scarred from this for life and this guy gets 37 months to be back on the streets and (rape) again,"" Capri said.

Capri originally said Martin was linked to five rapes in the area, but Sgt. Kelsey Harris, a police spokesman, said after the media conference that detectives have connected the suspect to a total of seven rapes. More investigative work still needs to be done, but Martin is suspected of committing one rape in 2010, two in 2014, one in 2017 and two in 2018, in addition to the Holly Hill case, Harris said.

He was booked Friday afternoon at the Volusia County Branch Jail on one count of sexual battery in connection with one of the reported rapes from 2018.

During the morning of Aug. 1, a woman was riding her bicycle in the 200 block of North Peninsula Drive when her brakes locked up on her, according to a police report. The woman, whose name and age were redacted from the report, was approached by Martin, who offered her assistance.

After she declined, Martin asked her whether she wanted any crack-cocaine, police said. After she declined that offer, Martin grabbed her by the throat, threw her to the ground and sexually battered her, the report stated.

The woman told detectives that Martin threatened to stab her if she resisted his advances, police said.

After he raped her, Martin became ""apologetic"" and asked the woman whether she thought he was a bad person for what he did to her, the report stated. Martin helped her with the bicycle and offered to take her out later to make up for what he did, police said.

The pair walked to the area of Hollywood Avenue where Martin walked away from the woman. That's when she left her bicycle in a random yard and ran to get help, according to the report.

Police said they called the woman Friday to let her know they caught the suspect, who was linked to the crime through DNA evidence.

During his interview with detectives Friday, Martin was ""graphic in his details"" when he confessed to his crimes, Capri told reporters. Detectives said Martin would offer his victims drugs and if they refused, he would have to ""get rough with them.""

Capri called it ""frustrating"" that Martin was not a registered sex offender, especially after his 2015 conviction. Had he been, police officers would have been monitoring him, which could have led to an arrest sooner, he said.

Martin has been a fixture along Ridgewood Avenue, in an area known for prostitution. He's been arrested for battery and other charges while hanging around Ridgewood, but he has also been seen by the road holding a lantern and praying with other homeless people in the area.

In August 2017, Martin was charged with aggravated battery after punching and choking a woman, who told police that she had previously dated Martin. She also said he had once served as her pimp, according to an arrest report. The charge was reduced to misdemeanor battery and he was found guilty. He was sentenced to 364 days in jail.

Capri called Martin ""deranged."" He also said the suspect has been charged a total of 44 times with 23 of those charges being felonies.

Holly Hill Police Chief Steve Aldrich said he couldn't disclose too many details about the rape investigation involving his agency, but confirmed that his detectives are meeting next week with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to discuss the case.

""Obviously, he's a guy who needs to be off the street,"" Aldrich said of Martin.

1011,'He really missed out on a lot:' Jacksonville widow works to prevent work-related deaths,"0 'He really missed out on a lot:' Jacksonville widow works to prevent work-related deaths

A Jacksonville woman is trying to prevent work-related deaths after she lost her husband on El Faro nearly four years ago.

Rochelle Hamm said not a day goes by that she doesn’t think about her husband, Frank Hamm.

“We have a set of twins, and my two last kids graduated,"" Hamm said. ""My daughter made prom queen and she made vice president of her class. He really missed out on a lot.""

Her husband was among 33 people who died when the ship bound for Puerto Rico sank during Hurricane Joaquin.

On Friday, Hamm shared her story in front of dozens of people wearing purple ribbons at the Florida Safety Council. They remembered 32 men and women who lost their lives while working in North Florida last year.

The Northeast Florida Safety Council says that number more than doubled from 14 people who were killed in work-related incidents in 2017.

Hamm says those tragedies and the one that killed her husband could have been prevented with more oversight from companies.

“It just bothers me, when I had to read in the transcripts. My husband, you know, he didn’t even have a life vest on. He was screaming and crying out for two life vests. He was a man of size so I know they didn’t have one to fit him, you know, and that was a problem for me,” Hamm said.

Hamm says she’s now working to prevent workplace accidents by calling for company accountability.

“My husband always talked about traveling the world and making money, but no one talks about safety,” she said.

Last year, she helped pass the Hamm Alert Maritime Safety Law in honor of her late husband to stop commercial ships from going out to sea in dangerous situations including hurricanes.

The Northeast Florida Safety Council told Action News Jax that the majority of work place related deaths in 2018 involved hurricane cleanup or construction jobs.

In the second incident days later, a 33-year-old woman said she was approached by a man who offered her money for sex. She was then attacked, beaten and raped. That attack happened in the area of Seabreeze Boulevard and Highway A1A in Daytona Beach.

1015,"Bedridden woman, 10 dogs removed from deplorable Dunedin home","Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

DUNEDIN, Fla. (WFLA) - A welfare check in Dunedin led authorities to a bedridden woman trapped in deplorable conditions plus nearly a dozen neglected and starved dogs, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.

The man tasked with taking care of them, 65 year old Richard Goodwin, is charged with abuse or neglect of an elderly or disabled person and two counts of animal cruelty.

Goodwin was arrested Wednesday night and bonded out of jail as of Thursday. However, he did not come to the door when News Channel 8 stopped by the home on Pinehurst Drive Thursday afternoon.

Neighbors call the case ""sad and sickening.""

""This is a really nice neighborhood, and to know this is going on right next door to you is appalling,"" said Tami Briganti.

Investigators say neither the 67 year old female victim nor the animals appeared to have food or water when they entered the home. Dogs were found in plastic bins, trapped in their own waste. Five large exotic birds were found loose in the home as well.

The victim was transported to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

Pinellas County Animal Services says the birds were not removed from the home but animal services officers removed the ten dogs. Some are puppies, just days old. All are doing okay despite the conditions they came from.

""We don't see (cases) like this everyday, but we see it a lot more frequently than we would like,"" said Pinellas County Animal Services director Doug Brightwell. ""Not an environment that anybody, animal or person, should be living in.""

Goodwin was arrested in May 2018 for neglecting the same woman. Court documents show the home was in just as bad a state then, covered in trash, feces, urine, and dead birds.

""I just would like to see this not ever happen again, for humans and for the animals,"" Tami Briganti said.

Court records show Goodwin is still awaiting trial for the 2018 charges. PCAS director Doug Brightwell says it is legally possible for Goodwin to reclaim the dogs while he waits for these newer charges to play out. However, Brightwell added that PCAS is considering petitioning for custody.

Story Highlights '""Sugar babies'""spend time with older men or women in exchange for financial and material support

The website SeekingArrangement.com says UCF has more than 1,000 students looking to become 'sugar babies""

Sugar babies say fears over debt are motivation to join website

ORLANDO, Fla. - With more than 68,000 students enrolled this past fall, the University of Central Florida is the second -largest university in the country by enrollment. UCF undergraduates pay about $17,000 a year for in-state tuition. The price tag increases to $33,000 for out of state students. On its website, the school boasts that 44% of its students graduate with no student debt. That's an accomplishment when the average college graduate owes more than $37,000, according to the website Debt.org.

To make sure they don't finish college deeply in debt, some students have turned to older men to help them pay their bills. The website SeekingArrangement.com ranks UCF as one of the fastest growing universities for relationships for ""sugar dating."" It's defined as a relationship between a ""sugar baby"" and a ""sugar daddy"" or ""sugar mama."" The website says there are more than 1,000 sugar babies at UCF, and Florida State University and the University of Florida aren't far behind. In fact, UCF is considered the second fastest-growing university for sugar babies.

'""Sugar"" terms to know, according to SeekingArrangement.com Sugar Baby - A young man or woman who accepts financial or material support from an older adult in exchange for being in the relationship

Sugar Daddy - A man who offers financial or material support to a younger woman or man

Sugar Mama - A woman who offers financial or material support to a younger man or woman

Channel 9 reporter Lauren Seabrook spoke with one sugar baby named Michelle. Concerned about being identified, Michelle agreed to be interviewed over the phone.

""I get usually, like, $200 or $500 for each date,"" she told Seabrook. ""I don't work enough because of school, so I'm not getting paid enough. It helps me and it helps the other person who I have the arrangement with. It's a mutually beneficial relationship, I feel like.""

Michelle described the relationship she has with her sugar daddy. She says he is a successful businessman in Orlando who pays her to be by his side while networking with investors.

""It's strictly companionship,"" she said. ""The website is just for finding connections and real relationships. If you do any sexual comments or terms, they'll ban you from the website.""

In a statement to WFTV, a representative from SeekingArrangement.com explained its rules, stressing that the website is a platform for consenting adults and is not transactional.

""We do not allow solicitation of any kind, and this includes prostitution and escorting,"" said Kimberly De La Cruz. ""Anyone caught using transactional language will be banned.""

""The sugar babies themselves are not considered prostitutes.""

Some have asked why this is not considered prostitution. Channel 9 legal analyst Bill Sheaffer explained sex is not what is being exchanged for money in these arrangements.

""You're paying for companionship and social interaction and although sex may be involved, it is not what you are paying a woman for,"" Sheaffer said. ""And the sugar babies themselves are not considered prostitutes because they are being compensated for their time and companionship and not being offered money for sex without time and companionship.""

Seabrook reviewed the website and did not find any blatant requests for sex. However, Seeking Arrangement does allow sugar daddies to say they're looking for 'friends with benefits.'

Michelle's sugar daddy is 25 years her senior; she is 23 years old. She told Seabrook she agreed to the relationship because he was good-looking and not creepy.

""We laughed the whole night. It was definitely not uncomfortable or anything,"" she said. ""It's really just dinners in super fancy places I never thought I would actually eat at. But it's really exciting.""

The sugar baby, whose name is Michelle, attends the University of Central Florida. She spoke with Seabrook on the phone because she did not want to be identified. Michelle said she makes up to $500 per date as a sugar baby. © 2019 Cox Media Group.

She's continuing with what she calls a ""business deal"" because she says he respects her as a person and gives her advice on work and school.

""It's not like we're giving up our bodies for men,"" she told Seabrook, ""I don't have to do anything that I'm not comfortable with.""

""He wanted feet pictures as his pleasure.""

Another student at UCF had a different experience as a sugar baby. Tina, who agreed to speak with Seabrook as long as she was not identified, had a sugar daddy who had a foot fetish.

""He would just send, like, an emoji, like the feet emoji. Then I would send him pictures of my feet just crossed or straight or if I got a pedicure or whatever and he would just be, like, 'Go buy yourself something nice.'""

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a fetish as an object or bodily part whose real or fantasied presence is psychologically necessary for sexual gratification and that is an object of fixation to the extent that it may interfere with complete sexual expression.

Tina's arrangement started on the social media website Instagram. She told Seabrook the man would send her $50 here and $30 there all through a cash app, just to get her attention.

Lauren Seabrook spoke with one UCF student who said she cut off a relationship with a sugar daddy when he began to behave strangely. © 2019 Cox Media Group.

""I ignored him for a while. Then I opened up my Venmo one day and there was money just all over.""

When Tina finally replied to the man she agreed to a plan that did not involve an emotional connection or meeting in person.

""You can show me a little bit of respect.""

""He just wanted to be able to text me every day and he wanted feet pictures as his pleasure,"" she said.""

After receiving about $700, Tina said her sugar daddy started to get angry when she did not text him all of the time.

""He was like, 'you know, you can show me a little bit of respect,'"" she said.

Tina stopped responding and the money stopped coming in.

Seabrook reached out to the UCF Police Department about potential safety issues. Officers advised that any relationship with a stranger online should be handled with caution, adding that if something seems to good to be true, it probably is and that should be a red flag.

SeekingArrangement.com claims students turning to sugar daddies can make an average of $3,000 a month. But it's not just students looking for the extra cash.

In 2018, a spokesperson with SeekingArrangement.com told Channel 9's sister station in Jacksonville they had at least 100,000 women who were not just sugar babies, but single mothers.

Action News Jax spoke with a woman from Orange Park, Florida, about her arrangement with her sugar daddy. They did not use her last name to protect the identity of her then 8-year-old son.

""There is romance,"" Kim said, ""but it's not about romance. It's about filling each other's need, showing guidance, support, emotional help, and, obviously, financial.""

At the time, Kim claimed her suigar daddy gave her a minimum of $3000 a month, but sometimes more. She said she used the money to help support her son.

""It got to the point he was wanting to go do things, or want things, and I couldn't provide,"" she said.

In-state students pay $17,000 a year to attend the University of Central Florida. © 2019 Cox Media Group.

Women such as Michelle and Tina, worried about bills before they're out of school, agree it's a legitimate way to take care of yourself.

""Do you think this is a good way for people to pay off their debt?"" asked Seabrook.

""Yes, I do. If you're willing to do it, and you don't find any harm in it, and you enjoy it, and there's nothing scary to you about it, then you should do it,"" said Tina.

Seabrook also spoke with a sugar daddy about his experience with sugar dating. He lives in Manhattan, claims to be a successful businessman and says he shows his 'babies' a good time. Hear about his lifestyle Friday ay 5:30 p.m. on Channel 9 Eyewitness News.

St. Petersburg, Fla. (WFLA) - Cheryl and Arthur Maxwell wanted to be laid to rest together, at Royal Palm Cemetery South in St. Petersburg.

Mr. Maxwell passed away in 2003. Shortly after that, Cheryl began making payments on her own spot, right next to his. She paid off the plot in full and kept her paperwork so that her family would fulfill her wishes.

But when she passed away last month, the family was shocked to discover someone else had already been buried in Cheryl's spot.

""At first, they told us there was no body in the site, and we found it with sand covering it and couldn't see a grave marker for anyone else,"" said Celia Thomas, Cheryl's sister. ""I think they were stalling.""

Soon, though, Thomas says they discovered the truth. Another woman had been buried in the spot beside Arthur. The cemetery put Cheryl in a mausoleum temporarily.

""It's terrible,"" said her mother, Florence Jenkins. ""Her wish was to be buried by her husband. That is where she should be. They should not have sold the site to anyone else.""

The cemetery offered to move Mr. Maxwell to another part of the cemetery and then bury Cheryl beside him, but the family says that is unacceptable.

""I feel badly for the other family,"" Thomas said. ""There is no good resolution here, but the only thing to do is move the person who should not have been buried there. My sister should get what she paid for.""

Thomas and Jenkins turned to Better Call Behnken for help.

""I'm not going to let it go,"" Thomas said. ""I'm not going to let it go. As long as I have breath in my body, I'm not going to let it go.""

So I went with the family to Royal Palm Cemetery South. We were first told to wait outside in the heat for the maintenance supervisor who could help us. That supervisor walked right past us and went inside. We waited for about 50 minutes and watched as pizza was delivered.

Finally, I asked if anyone was coming and was told that they had changed their minds and no one would be talking to us.

The maintenance supervisor finally emerged and admitted that the staff had mixed up the plot numbers and buried someone else in plot number 56 - Cheryl's spot. The woman was supposed to be buried in lot number 51.

We asked to speak to the owner, Cliff Work, but the office administrator asked us to leave. We went to his Tampa home but were stopped by security at the gated Tampa neighborhood. Work did not return messages seeking comment for this story.

Florida's Department of Financial Services regulates cemeteries and a spokeswoman says they're deeply concerned, and they are launching an investigation.

1018,Those on Florida's front lines in the abortion battle know change is coming,"Crusaders on both sides are gearing up for the fight, as conservatives look to court advantage.

TALLAHASSEE — Turn out of the 11th floor elevator bank in the Florida State Capitol and the magenta carpet leads to the offices of two lawmakers who are running out of time.

By this April morning, the year’s legislative session has already ticked halfway past. Stalled bills teeter toward failure.

In suite 1102, by the door with the framed “feminism” poster, freshman Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani knows her pro-choice proposal never had a chance.

Across the hall, in 1101, Republican Rep. Mike Hill tries not to get frustrated that his bill isn’t gaining traction, either. He’s been following the same ban he proposed as it sweeps through Georgia, Ohio, Mississippi, outlawing abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks. Hill reminds himself to trust in God’s timing.

In hallways and on the House floor, Hill and Eskamani don’t often speak. Abortion has long been an uneasy standoff in Florida, where a privacy clause in the state’s Constitution has fended off many of the restrictions that have shuttered clinics in other states.

But politicians on both sides sense the turning tide, that the newly conservative U.S. Supreme Court may chip away at the right to terminate pregnancies or send the issue back to the states to decide, one by one.

Abortion foes across the country, after years of pushing incremental constraints, have launched a barrage of severe restrictions, some designed deliberately to dismantle precedent.

In Florida, a single abortion bill — on parental consent — creeps forward this year, but it has the potential to open the floodgates for many more. Hill and Eskamani are watching, and they can feel the ground moving.

***

Faded billboards dot the scrubby edges of Interstate 10 west toward the capital. Blue-eyed babies plead, “At 18 Days Our Hearts Are Beating!” Fetuses curl in wombs that look like the insides of eyelids.

New billboards flash orange against the Florida pine: “ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE.”

All roads lead to Tallahassee, to windowless committee halls and the white dome of the Florida Supreme Court across from the Capitol, where three new justices give conservatives an overwhelming dominance. If abortion rights contract in Florida, the decision will likely happen here.

For years, Florida has been an outlier, a haven for abortion seekers in a more hostile South. That’s because the state Constitution protects “from governmental intrusion into the person’s private life.”

In 1989, for instance, the state Supreme Court struck down an attempt to make minors get parental consent for abortions: “We can conceive of few more personal or private decisions concerning one's body that one can make in the course of a lifetime.”

Florida lawmakers knew abortion limits would tee up costly court battles most likely doomed to fail.

But the single abortion bill advancing this year, an overhaul of the bill that fell three decades ago, tackles the privacy clause head-on. The House has been receptive, the Senate lukewarm, but advocates on both sides say this is a preview of what’s to come.

***

Eskamani and Hill lie toward the edges of their parties, one a proud progressive and the other the founder of the Northwest Florida Tea Party. Both have had marginal success getting bills to move. Both made waves in their campaigns — Hill for his viral pitch to move Trump’s oft-vandalized Hollywood star to Pensacola; Eskamani for asking her rally crowds, “You see the s--t we put up with?”

They both grew up working class; both are people of color. Eskamani is the daughter of Iranian immigrants, Hill one of just two black Republican lawmakers in Florida — but he hates to be grouped into anything with a hyphen. Call him an American, he says.

They’re on two committees together, and though Hill can’t remember agreeing with Eskamani on a single thing, he respects the genuine beliefs that fuel her. She finds him kind and collegial.

Both tweet often, especially about abortion. Eskamani mixes threads on reproductive health and progressive immigration policy with snappy clap-backs to the GOP, like a Florida version of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

Hill sticks to the MAGA-style formula, decrying the “demonic Muslim horde” and retweeting all-caps posts about liberal lunacy and abortion as murder.

Take @AnnaForFlorida, in early April, in a back-and-forth with a Republican: “Access to a safe & legal abortion can’t be compared to cable TV. 1 in 4 women have had an abortion in this country— the # is on the decline & that’s due to access to birth control & sex-ed.”

Or @Mikehillfl in early April, retweeting a popular pro-Trump account that posted: “This powerful video is a MUST WATCH! The only person who doesn't get a choice in an abortion is the poor baby who's butchered alive!”

***

Outside Hill’s office, a printout sits on his aide’s desk. It’s an invitation to a showing of Unplanned, about a former Planned Parenthood clinic director-turned pro-lifer. Tagline: “What she saw changed everything.”

Inside, there’s a blue couch, beige walls, white lilies. His wide desk is bare but for some papers and a small stack of books, including one that promises The Biblical Path to Pro-Life Victory in the 21st Century and a biography of the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Hill has only read the foreword, but as a fellow devotee of the Constitution, he admired it.

Hill, 60, represents Pensacola, as far west as the Panhandle goes. This session, his second full term, he pushed to protect Confederate and veteran memorials but found little support.

His heartbeat ban, despite its long roster of co-sponsors and likely support from the governor, might have been too extreme for Florida, or not strategic enough. But he wonders: What else is he supposed to do as an Evangelical?

“I have no choice but to run this,” he says, holding his broad hands open, almost helpless.

He remembers being 13 and bored with only the Armed Forces Network to watch on the Italian base where his dad was stationed. Out of options, he picked up the Good News Bible, a leftover from Sunday school in the States. Those classes had never made sense. You’re telling me Jesus is the lamb, but also the shepherd?

He dove into Matthew.

He thought, “I’ve never read anything like that.”

It was ninth grade, 1972, and Hill started carrying the Good News everywhere, even as classmates yelled, “Mike Hill is a Jesus freak!” Later, as he took the ACT that could get him into his dream school, he prayed with each bubble, “Lord, please.”

His first night off the bus at the U.S. Air Force Academy, he got his head shaved. Officers screamed at him. He’d come craving the order his house of nine siblings lacked, but now he wondered what he had done.

Those were the years that his conviction in God wavered. The Bible became just another book.

As for abortion, he thought, let a woman choose.

It was the woman he’d marry who brought him back to church. And it was the era of Reaganomics, and his night MBA classes, that led him to register as a Republican.

In the mid-1980s, early in his wife’s first pregnancy, she miscarried.

“That quickly, she had a bond with that baby,” Hill says. Her grief felt like an epiphany to him. So did the sight of a school bus of kids and the want that filled him. He and his wife grieved together as she miscarried again.

Around that time, a Christian radio station debuted in Fort Walton Beach, where Hill was directing tests on missiles for the Air Force. He remembers hearing — for the first time — that abortion was a sin. That what he thought of as a clump of cells was a life, created by God.

He remembers when a protester at a Pensacola clinic shot Dr. David Gunn three times in 1993, the first known killing of an abortion provider in America, and the next year, when a second Pensacola doctor and his escort also were shot dead. Hill felt that any kind of extremist violence was wrong. Yet he realized just how deeply some people believed abortion needed to end and by any means.

He remembers the young woman who came to his State Farm office, pregnant. He asked her if she wanted life insurance for the baby, too, but she said she didn’t plan on keeping it. They talked. Two days later, she returned and said she’d changed her mind.

His wide-set eyes grow big as he marvels at the creation of new DNA, a new personality, in the womb. His bill replaces the word “fetus” with “unborn human being.” Hill brushes off concerns, though his bill would effectively ban abortion before some women even know they’re pregnant. A woman wouldn’t hurt herself with a coat hanger to end a pregnancy, he scoffs. He wishes he didn’t have to include exceptions for rape and incest.

“To me, it’s utterly amazing that God would give a woman the privilege of carrying a life in her body,” he says, his voice boyish in its awe.

***

In the middle of March, Hill had stood in the Capitol’s marbled rotunda, hoping to give his heartbeat bill momentum at a press conference. Other states were moving forward, faster.

“You can go to prison for destroying an eagle’s egg,” lamented Sen. Dennis Baxley of Ocala, the bill’s Senate sponsor. “Yet, somehow we reconcile that it’s okay to put women in this position and open a doorway that says it’s okay to destroy your offspring.”

Eskamani stood before the men, impassive. She had helped scramble protesters, who flooded in 60-something strong, holding hot pink signs like “WE DECIDE” and “ABORTION BANS ARE DANGEROUS.”

Hill, in a firm voice, said Florida was no New York or Virginia, where pro-choice politicians were trying to ease restrictions on late-term abortions. “We celebrate life,” he said, as cameras rolled.

A fellow activist nudged Eskamani to “do a mic check,” to make a megaphone out of supporters’ voices.

She had nothing scripted, and she worried that she’d offend her legislative colleagues.

But she shut down that thought. They were offending her with their policies.

“Mic check,” she finally said loudly, the muscle memory and adrenaline kicking in.

The crowd around her echoed every line.

“WE SUPPORT ACCESS,” she shouted,

“TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH!”

“INCLUDING” — she paused,

“ACCESS” —

“TO A SAFE AND LEGAL” —

“ABORTION!”

Hill could barely hear reporters’ questions, as others swarmed Eskamani.

“If this ever does reach the governor’s desk,” she told them, breathless, “he should know that the women around me are going to be there.”

***

In her office, Eskamani tracks bills on a beat-up Macbook covered in faded stickers, her walls a gallery. There she is, jubilant at Orlando Pride. A poster shouts, “My favorite season is the fall of the patriarchy.” There’s her face on Time magazine’s 2018 “Avengers” cover: First they marched. Now they’re running.

Recently, she hung a photo from Persian New Year. Dark hair streaming behind her, she leaps with glee over a fire, while her twin sister, Ida, pours on more gasoline just ahead.

She’s got a flurry of bills at play this session, trying to increase training on sexual harassment, make it harder for domestic abusers to keep guns and get money for her local library.

When Eskamani is stressed, which is often recently, she fingers the gold necklace she hasn’t taken off since her mom got sick with cancer.

After she died, Eskamani and her sister didn’t know where to turn when their bodies began to change. They were 13 and couldn’t drive to buy pads or tampons. They didn’t know how to talk with their dad.

Every month, Eskamani bled through the paper towels stuffed into her shorts.

She remembers the shame, too, of her high school sex education in Orlando, the chewed stick of gum held up to illustrate a used woman, and the candy she was offered to mark her “commit-mint” to abstinence. She was a people pleaser but stormed out of the classroom without taking it.

She remembers searching for information online and finding Planned Parenthood. At 18, she made an appointment. At the modest health center near the University of Central Florida, she saw moms bouncing babies and boyfriends picking up girlfriends’ pills. She left with a birth control prescription of her own.

Those were the years she read books by Iranian women to better understand her mom. There was a word for what she felt, and it was feminism.

At UCF, she wrote op-eds about women’s rights and began escorting patients through picket lines at Planned Parenthood, which later hired her to host events and then do public affairs.

Every year she worked there, at least one attempt to restrict abortion moved through the Legislature, despite the likelihood of a court challenge. She’d wear her Planned Parenthood pink dress to Tallahassee and watch from the gallery as legislators greenlit new restrictions. Back at the clinics, she’d wipe tears from patients’ faces.

In recovery rooms, she handed out ginger ale, heat packs, crackers. Patients flew in from Central America, drove hours from other states, called the front desk scared to get out of the car. She became a notary, so she could sign off on parental notifications for minors. In here, she wanted patients to understand, you’re safe.

Her Planned Parenthood boss wrote one of the first checks to her 2018 campaign.

Eskamani, 28, has always felt abortion is nuanced, a decision for a woman, her doctor, her faith and her family. She believes in the power of telling women’s stories, especially since some of her fellow Democrats still balk at defending abortion in the spotlight.

She discovered, by accident, that her own mother had an abortion.

She found the clinic papers while sifting through a briefcase of family documents. Her mom had been 40; the pregnancy had been high-risk. Eskamani imagines her mom walking that picket line, with three children at home, making that choice.

***

Hill takes the elevator down one Monday in April, phone in hand, committee-bound. Over his heart, he wears a tiny gold pin, baby feet at 10 weeks.

The House Judiciary Committee room is nearly full, and he takes a seat near the end of a long table up front. As the agenda unspools, members debate esoteric proposals for an hour before Republican Rep. Erin Grall approaches the lectern to discuss her parental consent bill.

Florida Channel cameras roll, sending a stream to TVs across the Capitol, and into Eskamani’s office, where she flips through binder tabs and listens, pained.

It’s not enough, Grall explains, that minors must notify parents or guardians before an abortion. She wants doctors to get a parent’s formal consent.

She explains that minors can seek a judicial waiver to bypass the requirement. Her bill would provide for them to have a pro bono lawyer.

Eskamani knows abortion opponents have a powerful weapon in this bill, because it appears palatable and yet packs a punch.

One by one, people from the audience walk up to the microphone. A woman from a Catholic group says to support parents’ involvement, because the adolescent brain is underdeveloped. A belligerent man with a bald spot plugging “infowars dot com” shouts, “Abortion is bringing this country under judgment,” while a woman in the crowd nods, eyes squeezed shut. A man with spiky, gelled hair and a paisley pocket square says: “One life is worth everything.”

Hill’s stoic face gives up a small smile.

Social workers, Latina activists, law students and Planned Parenthood defenders approach in hot pink T-shirts. They speak of abuse, incest, domestic violence. They talk about minors who attempt unsafe abortions.

A woman holds the hand of her curly-haired daughter, who wears a fuzzy vest in Cookie Monster blue.

“As a person that was sexually abused by one of my brothers,” the woman says, “I completely understand that I would not have been able to bring this up with my parents.”

On TV, Eskamani sees the whole panel: 16 male legislators, two female, and the stream of women begging to be heard.

Shortly before the vote, Rep. Mike Beltran, a Republican from Lithia, leans on an elbow.

He references the woman who came with her daughter.

“Beautiful little daughter with curly hair,” he says. “And that was perhaps the most compelling argument of all for this bill.”

Hill votes “Yes.”

***

Two weeks later, lawmakers swivel in cushioned chairs on the House floor, awaiting debate on the parental consent bill, buried deep in the afternoon agenda. At her desk in the back corner, Eskamani readies for her last stand.

House Bill 1335 is finally called at 6 p.m.

She doesn’t have the votes to stop the bill, but she’s drafted questions and prepped Democrats for battle.

Why not work to stop unintended pregnancies instead? Medical professionals have grave concerns, are you aware?

Grall stands with a microphone, fending off the barrage.

“I believe that parents have the best interests for their children in mind for their medical outcomes,” she says.

How are minors without internet access supposed to know their options? Is the current parental notice system not effective? What has changed that would make this legislation constitutional?

Eskamani stands to introduce an amendment, which would make information about judicial waivers easier to find. But the room is growing louder. Some leaders just walk out.

“Madam Speaker, there’s a lot of noise back here if you could help,” Eskamani says, exasperated. “We want young people to make an informed decision.”

Her amendment fails.

In debate, thanks largely to Eskamani’s spreadsheets and prep work, Democrats paint pictures of at-risk girls forced to carry babies to term and teenagers who live 45 minutes from the closest courthouse.

Republicans speak less but urge colleagues not to deprive all parents of rights because of a few bad apples. Don’t teens need permission for an aspirin in the nurse’s office or a trip to the zoo? They point out that the privacy clause says nothing explicitly about abortion. A few quote Psalms and Jeremiah.

Hill doesn’t speak. Instead, he retweets a stock image of babies with the caption, “Jesus loves the children born, preborn, unplanned, planned, unwanted, wanted, perfect, not perfect!” He tweets about his heartbeat bill with his usual commentary: “Come on, Florida!”

In the middle of all this, Eskamani stands again, hand on hip. She paces, looking down at the carpet.

“Imagine that you’re 16 years old, you realize you’re pregnant, and you literally have no one to talk to,” Eskamani says. She looks up. “Or in fact, members, imagine that you’re me.”

She tells them her mom died when she was a teenager. That her dad left to work abroad. She said she was scared to become pregnant. What would she do?

She looks down at her notes.

“I humbly ask for you to have some empathy on this issue,” she says. “It’s not black and white.”

Soon, the vote board will light up in green, and the bill will sail over to the Senate, where a slightly different version is stuck in the committee phase, with about one week to rush it to the floor.

Eskamani knows the battles are just beginning, that abortion opponents won’t let this moment pass, not while they have power in every branch.

So she plans to introduce her pro-choice bill again. Hill, quietly, plans the same for his heartbeat bill. The lines have been drawn.

MARION COUNTY, Fla. - Marion County investigators said a suspect is accused of filling a woman's car with sugar.

The sheriff's office said the victim told investigators she allowed the suspect to use her 2006 Hyundai Azera on Sunday.

The woman told deputies she picked up her car Monday, according to the sheriff's office.

The victim drove to a gas station, and when she tried to put gas in her car, something was blocking her way, according to investigators.

Investigators said the mechanic told her someone put sugar in her tank and it was blocking the gas neck.

The mechanic told the woman it would cost $500 to remove and clean the gas tank, according to the incident report.

The victim told investigators she received a text from the suspect asking her how she liked walking, according to the incident report.

The woman called the sheriff's office after she got that text, according to investigators.

1022,Tow truck driver named Miracle credited with woman's rescue,"MACCLENNY, Fla. - A Baker County tow truck driver working the graveyard shift is being credited for possibly saving an elderly woman’s life.

The remarkable episode unfolded about 2:15 a.m. Thursday on County Road 125 in the tightknit community of Manntown, just outside of Macclenny.

Chris Miracle, who works for his family's business Miracle Towing and Recovery, was headed to an out-of-county call about a road block when he saw some flashing lights in the woods while looking for deer.

Miracle couldn't shake the feeling that he needed to turn around. ""I went about a mile down the road and I was like, 'This doesn't look right,'"" he recalled. ""Nothing flashes at the church.""

It's a good thing he trusted his gut. Searching for the source of the light through some thick brush about 40 yards off the road, he spotted a car plunged halfway into a creek behind the Manntown Church.

""I mean, it was almost sitting nose down,"" Miracle said.

SLIDESHOW: Tow truck driver rescues woman trapped in car

When he opened the car's door, he found a 77-year-old woman seated inside. He started asked her questions -- was she OK? Was there anyone else with her?

As Miracle learned, the unnamed woman's vehicle had veered off the road after an apparent mishap with her medication. Without a cell phone and unable to open the car doors, she had nowhere to go.

So the woman turned off the sedan's engine, switched on her hazard lights and played some gospel music to pass the time.

Miracle, who happens to be a volunteer firefighter, called for rescue. Then he winched the car with the woman inside and hauled it to safety. The woman was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.

Incidentally, the motto for Miracle Towing and Recovery is ""miracles do happen here."" As Miracle would agree, there's perhaps no better example of those words than Thursday's timely rescue.

""Absolutely,"" he said. ""And no better place for a miracle to happen then at the Manntown church. I mean the timing was just impeccable.""

Based on how well the woods hid the car, Miracle doesn't think it's likely he would have noticed it without the flashing lights. He doesn't think anyone would have seen it during daytime.

That could have been disastrous for the woman inside.

The woman, who asked not to be identified, is out of the hospital and is doing well. She told News4Jax she's thankful for Miracle and the first responders who came to her rescue.

While some might call it coincidence or just plain old luck, Miracle thinks there's definitely more to it. To him, it's a miracle in Manntown.

""God’s work,"" he said. ""Right place, right time. It was meant to be.""

HOMESTEAD, Fla. - A Homestead woman was arrested Tuesday after she threatened to get a gun and ""kill everyone"" at South Dade Technical College, police said.

According to a police report, Stephanie Perez, 30, went to the school to speak with a counselor about enrolling there.

""Perez then explained to the counselor that she had problems with students attending the school over an incident that occurred at her residence,"" according to the report.

When the counselor advised her to contact the Homestead Police Department about the incident, Perez ""became angry and began to yell that she was going home to get a gun and would be returning to the school to kill everyone,"" police said.

The counselor called police.

Perez was later taken into custody at her home. Police said she provided a recorded confession.

She was released from the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on bond.

1029,Do women have a right to wear whatever they want to church?,"Notre Dame University basilica.

While we train ourselves to ignore some news items and Facebook posts, once in awhile, something begs for comment.

When Maryann White, a Catholic mother of sons, wrote a letter to the editor of the Notre Dame University newspaper (Indiana, not Paris) asking women to stop wearing leggings to church, she received a backlash of criticism.

As a woman, mother, grandmother and substitute teacher for local Catholic schools, I couldn’t let that one go.

Even critics at the university admitted she probably “meant well.” That didn’t stop them from protesting, however, or stop the inevitable “experts” from chiming in.

According to the Chicago Tribune, Barbara Risman, sociology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said White’s letter shows that ""a double standard persists, where shame and judgment are associated with how women might dress, but not for men — a furthering of the view that women are not equal.”

Hogwash.

Equal worth doesn’t mean equal DNA. Most of academia believes in human evolution, including the fact men and women have evolved with glaring differences. We’re wired for sex (which keeps the population rising), but we go about it differently. Although scientists haven’t figured it all out, it appears that men are visually stimulated while women respond more to context.

Maryann White addressed women’s attire at church, not class, bars, malls or sidewalks. Out there, anything goes, pretty much. Inside a sanctuary, where the focus is to be on the Creator rather than on any creation of any size or shape, the outcry against her request for more modesty is ridiculous.

Such requirements are common worldwide. In Vatican City, in Jerusalem, at Mecca, in Hindu temples in India, in some Protestant churches, modest attire is mandated. It is subjective — no sleeveless tops or shorts at the Vatican; long, loose-fitting garments and the hair covered in Mecca. Wiki-how even has a “How to Dress For Church Services” blog. Reasonable people understand this.

Wherever worshipers are, it’s respectful and expected to keep distractions to a minimum. In that setting, one would not kindly regard someone who’s smacking gum loudly or talking on a cellphone. Inappropriate clothing can have the same effect.

Taken to an extreme, bikinis and speedos, while appropriate for the beach, are inappropriate at the grocery store. Or a worship service. At the beach, no one notices. At church, such attire would scream “Look at me!

It’s an empirical, scientifically proven fact that many men like looking at women. Newsflash: They’re not going to stop. It is in their DNA. No evil intent required. No drooling necessary. Honest appreciation can happen with women wearing tents, but will probably happen more with women wearing tight, revealing clothing in a setting where such attire is outside accepted norms.

Do women have a right to wear whatever they want, whenever they want, with no responsibility of any kind, regardless of the situation? Common sense, I submit, answers “no.”

I personally believe churches should be open to anyone, dressed any way. They should be inclusive and welcoming, inviting and comforting and respectful.

But it’s also not asking too much for those attending to be respectful in return. At Notre Dame’s Basilica of the Sacred Heart, on the campus of a Catholic university, I would think folks realized that.

1030,Treasure Island Apt. Tenant blames nasty fall on faulty stairs,"Treasure Island Apt. Tenant blames nasty fall on faulty stairs Video

Treasure Island, FLA - A horrible fall down a flight of stairs shattered Cheri Starm's wrist and led to her service dog being put down.

The Treasure Island woman is blaming her apartment building managers for not maintaining the building.

“There was a lip right here and you can see where they've ground off quite a bit” said Starms.

Starms pointed out where she tumbled down a set of iron and concrete stairs leading from the second floor to street level

She blames a raised section of steal that tripped her near the top landing.

“We hit that and we were going down. I landed at the end, in fact, my fingers were back here where my wrist was at” said Starms.

The fall also badly injured her service dog, Gator, which she had for 6 years.



“Unfortunately the leg injuries she sustained, she had to be put down” she said.



Starms captured video of repairs on the steps. Soon after, a City inspector issued a ""stop work order"" saying the job was done by an unlicensed contractor, without a permit.

A co-owner of the complex explained a city worker told him, a permit wasn't needed.

Igor Savic sent an engineering report detailing how repairs will be done properly, and apologized to Starms.

A friend of Starms said she also had trouble navigating the stairs. “Going up the stairs, I tripped and I fell, I did not fall down the stairs, I feel toward the stairs” said Cynthia Kubli.

The apartment owner denies there are any problems with this staircase.

Starms points to her wrist and fatally-injured service dog, as proof, he is wrong.

A California woman made national headlines after surveillance video released Monday showed her throwing seven newborn puppies in a dumpster behind an auto parts store. Across the country, five puppies were also found in a dumpster in South Florida the very same day.A maintenance worker called animal control after discovering the young dogs at Sands at St. Lucie Apartment Homes Monday.The five dehydrated pit bull puppies were “thrown away like trash” in the apartment complex dumpster. According to United for Animals founder Susan Parry, only three females survived after they all contracted hookworms. The two males in the litter did not make it. The female pit bulls were immediately taken to the St. Lucie County Humane Society for treatment. But their owners were nowhere to be found.Joe Sweat, a spokesman with the city of Fort Pierce City Manager’s Office told WPBF this is not the first time residents have treated baby animals so cruelly.“Please call our Fort Pierce Animal Control who will gladly come to pick up the animal and relocate them to a shelter without cost,” Sweat said in an email.St. Lucie County Humane Society employees are looking for loving families to adopt the baby girls. “We will spay and neuter them, give them all their vaccines, microchip them,” St. Lucie County Humane Society shelter coordinator Theresa Agosta said.United for Animals’ founder said the situation is very tragic.“In my years of working United for Animals mobile outreach program assisting people and their pets I have seen how ignorance can lead to acts of cruelty!” Parry said.She hopes to find the puppies’ mother.“There are unanswered questions regarding this case and United For Animals is now focused on getting the mother of these pit bull pups spayed as well as getting the word out that there are lots of options and aide for those who need help with their animals,” Parry said in a statement.

1033,'Don't be a gold digger and I won't be treating you like a hooker' - sugar daddy talks lifestyle,"0 'Don't be a gold digger and I won't be treating you like a hooker' - sugar daddy talks lifestyle

Story Highlights Financial support is the core of the relationship between ""sugar babies"" and ""sugar daddies"" or ""sugar mamas""

The website SeekingArrangement.com says the average age of a ""Sugar Daddy"" is 38 and he has an average income of $250,000

Lauren Seabrook spoke with an experienced ""Sugar Daddy"" about his arrangements

ORLANDO, Fla. - Looking at 57-year-old Robert in a red plaid shirt, you might think he was no different from any other man. He enjoys music, loves animals and likes to drink socially. But his passions also include younger women, and he heartily enjoys his role as a ""sugar daddy."" His last sugar baby was 21-years-old.

""She got to experience things, and she came from a little town, where she would not have experienced them. She wouldn't have had the city nightlife or gone down to the Fountainbleau hotel in Florida.""

The Fountainbleau is a luxury hotel in Miami Beach. It opened in 1954. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Provided by Fountainbleau Resorts

Channel 9 reporter Lauren Seabrook spent a month speaking with Robert and two sugar babies, Michelle and Tina, before they agreed to be formally interviewed about the ""sugar lifestyle."" All three asked we not use their last names; Michelle spoke to us over the phone, and Tina asked we not show her face on camera.

""It's just something that you don't like to share to the world,"" Tina said.

Michelle and Tina candidly spoke about their fears of graduating from the University of Central Florida with an overwhelming amount of student loan debt. Financial stress compiled with balancing the responsibilities and commitments of a full-time college education compelled them to look for alternative forms of income.

""It's quick, easy, fast money,"" Tina told Seabrook. ""Where it's a job...it's really nothing.""

""""I don't work enough because of school, so I'm not getting paid enough,"" Michelle explained.

The women decided to become sugar babies. Tina met her sugar daddy on Instagram. Michelle turned to the website SeekingArrangement.com, one of several WFTV found that acts as a platform to connect aspiring sugar babies with older men or women willing to provide financial support in exchange for time and attention. Seeking Arrangement says sugar babies make an average of $3,000 a month from sugar daddies or sugar mamas that have an average annual income of $250,000.

The University of Central Florida is considered the second fastest growing university for sugar babies. Here are some of the profiles Lauren Seabrook found on SeekingArrangement.com. We blurred their faces to protect their identities. © 2019 Cox Media Group.

Michelle described her arrangement with a man she says is successful and takes her to nice dinners. Tina told Seabrook about an arrangement that was less polite: She had a sugar daddy who sent her money in exchange for pictures of her feet.

The women use the money for whatever they want.

""I'll help somebody out whether it's paying for a little tuition or paying for car payments or whatever. Then we go on nice, like five-star vacations,"" Robert told Seabrook.

Robert, who goes by ""Manhattan Guy,"" says he considers himself successful. He told Seabrook he makes $200,000 as a day trader in New York City and has a net worth of a million dollars. And he's looking for a certain type of younger woman.

""Don't be a gold digger, and I won't be treating you like a hooker,"" he said.

According to money.cnn.com, the cost of living comparison between Manhattan and Orlando means $200,000 in New York is slightly under $80,000 in Central Florida.

Robert, who has participated in the sugar lifestyle for more than a dozen years, believes he is a good influence on his sugar babies, and says he's even been a mentor to them. But it's not always the happiest of experiences for him.

""I once invited somebody over for a drink and I didn't know they were manic depressive and bipolar. After they had a few drinks, I had to tell them to leave because I had to get up for work in the morning,"" he told Seabrook. ""They were insulted that I was kicking them out.""

""I'm not desperate.""

There's also the reality of the age difference.

""I once said, do you want to go see Billy Joel, and she said, 'whose that?'"" Robert shared.

Others aspects of his arrangements have been less dramatic, but also disappointing for him. He said some women want to be paid to go on vacation with him and others ask for expensive gifts, such as designer handbags.

""I don't want to be used. If I'm going to have any physical connection with somebody, I want to feel they want to be with me,"" he shared with Seabrook. ""I want a little meaning there. I don't want this all about sex for money. There are plenty of women who write to you who say, 'hey, I'll come to your house. Give me $400.'""

""I'm not desperate. I don't have to do that,"" Robert said.

Seabrook asked Robert what portion of his arrangements with potential sugar babies he expected to be sexual.

""I'm at a point where they go hand in hand,"" he said.

Robert believes that for some men and women these arrangements are a high-dollar, elite type of prostitution.

""This is just a symptom of society,"" he said.

We asked Seeking Arrangement to clarify its position on any physical relationship between its sugar community members. A spokesperson told Seabrook it is inaccurate to describe ""sugar dating"" as prostitution.

""We do not allow solicitation of any kind, and this includes prostitution and escorting,"" said Kimberly De La Cruz. ""Anyone caught using transactional language will be banned. We have a customer support team that works around the clock in three different countries, as well as artificial intelligence and a strong self-reporting community.""

SeekingArrangement.com claims to have a large online community, boasting 10 million members on its website. Spread across 139 countries, it says there are 8 million sugar babies and 2 million sugar daddies or sugar mamas. When we looked at the website for this story, we counted numerous links to join. Users are even able to attach their memberships to their Facebook profiles.

But, sometimes, not everything is as it seems.

""You can show me a little bit of respect.""

In 2018, an 18-year-old Florida woman told investigators in St. Johns County that her sugar daddy had sent her a check for a little more than $2,000. It bounced, resulting in her account being overdrawn by $1,600. The bank froze the account and she was unable to access it. She told authorities her sugar daddy lived in Houston, Texas, and was 41 years old. They met through an app. Investigators noted there were multiple names listed in the memo line of the check, and they were unable to find those individuals.

When Seabrook spoke with Tina about her sugar daddy with the foot fetish, Tina told her why she cut it off. She said the man became angry when she did not text him all of the time.

""He was like, 'you know, you can show me a little bit of respect,'"" she said.

Tina stopped responding and the money stopped coming in.

We reached out to the police department at the University of Central Florida when we learned UCF is the second-fastest university for sugar babies in the country.

In a statement, a spokesperson told us they see a potential relationship between an increase in sextortion-related cases and the sugar relationships.

""Our concern is people's actions later being used against them in a way that's criminal,"" Courtney Gilmartin said. ""UCFPD's advice to our students is to be smart and keep their personal safety top of mind.""

Sextortion is the practice of extorting money or sexual favors from someone by threatening to reveal evidence of their sexual activity. Watch the FBI's video about sextortion below:

The potential for problems down the road does not seem to be dissuading men and women of all ages from signing up to be part of the sugar communities. Seeking Arrangement says there are more than 1,000 sugar babies at UCF, and Florida State University and the University of Florida aren't far behind.

""It helps me and it helps the other person who I have the arrangement with,"" Michelle told Seabrook. ""It's a mutually beneficial relationship.""

1037,Woman arrested after complaining to Frontier Airlines about vomit in daughter's seat,"DURHAM, NC (WTVD/CNN) - A North Carolina woman is facing charges after she and her 14-year-old daughter were removed from a Frontier Airlines flight following a confrontation with a flight attendant about vomit on the teenager’s seat.

Rosetta Swinney, 53, says she will never ride Frontier Airlines again after the Easter weekend incident on a flight out of Las Vegas. The mother and her 14-year-old daughter had been in Nevada for a wedding.

On their way back Saturday, their flight was delayed, so staff could clean the plane. But when the two boarded, Swinney says her daughter found vomit in her seat.

""She jumped up and said, ‘Mom, my hands are wet.’ She smelled it. She said, ‘This is vomit, Mom.’ So, we went to look. It was on the bag, all over her shirt, her hands,” Swinney said.

Swinney says she was surprised the seat was dirty and alerted a flight attendant.

""I don’t know if she got offensive about it, but she turned around to me and said, ‘That’s not my job.’ If it wasn’t her job, why wasn’t it attended to?” Swinney said.

Frontier Airlines said in a statement that ""the flight attendants apologized and immediately invited the mother and her teenage daughter to move to either end of the plane so that the seat area could be cleaned.""

The statement also said that Swinney and her daughter were told “they would be provided other seats if available.”

Swinney disputes the airline’s account, saying the flight attendant never attempted to clean up the mess nor offered to reassign her seat. Witnesses onboard the flight later posted on Facebook with a story similar to Swinney’s.

The airline says Swinney was unsatisfied and became “disruptive,” so authorities were called to remove the mother and daughter from the plane.

""I felt humiliated,"" Swinney said. ""I felt more bad that my child had to see me be handcuffed and taken away from her.""

Swinney was put in jail for 12 hours, and her daughter was placed in child protective custody.

After getting out of jail, the mother bought a $1,000 ticket home through Delta Air Lines.

Frontier refunded the cost of her original flight, but Swinney has hired a civil rights attorney to fight her misdemeanor trespassing charge. She is due in court in June.",https://www.wfla.com/national/woman-arrested-after-complaining-to-frontier-airlines-about-vomit-in-daughters-seat/1953386850,2019-04-25T16:13:17Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1038,Man arrested in connection with fatal Liberty City shooting,"MIAMI - A Miami man was arrested Wednesday in connection with a fatal shooting that occurred April 6 in Liberty City.

Khambrel Barnes, 29, faces charges of second-degree murder, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

According to an arrest warrant, a ShotSpotter alerted police to six rounds being fired in the 6800 block of Northwest 15th Avenue.

Police said the victim, identified in the arrest warrant only by his last name, Nellicliff, was found around 8 a.m. by authorities. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Friends and family at the scene told Local 10's Parker Branton the victim, who was in his 60s, was a friendly face in the community and they didn't know who would want to kill him.

According to the arrest warrant, Barnes shot Nellicliff as the victim tried to defend two women whom Barnes was threatening with a gun.

Police said Barnes went to the area first in January 2018 and inquired about a former tenant to the property manager of a building who he said owed him money.

The property manager said she told Barnes the tenant no longer lived in the building.

She said Barnes returned more than a year later, on April 6, with a gun, asking for the same person.

She said she again told Barnes the person no longer lived there and asked him to leave the property.

According to the arrest warrant, Barnes got into an altercation with the property manager and another woman outside a nearby convenience store.

Police said he pulled out a revolver and threatened to kill the property manager, who knocked the gun away as it was pointed at her face. Authorities said the second woman helped fend off Barnes.

According to the warrant, Nellicliff, who was across the street, stepped in the street and exchanged words with Barnes in defense of the women.

Authorities said surveillance video shows Barnes running up to the victim, who set his grocery bags on the ground, and shooting him multiple times.

Police said he pointed the gun again at the women before running off.

According to the warrant, gang unit detectives helped identify Barnes in the surveillance video.

1042,"Whether it's crime or a questionable business tactic, Treasure Coast seniors can get help with scams","CLOSE The FTC is warning of a new phone scam where the caller will fake a call from the SSA to trick you into giving up your personal information. ERIC ROGERS/TCPALM Eric Rogers, Florida Today

A 96-year-old woman became the owner of a brand new car.

That didn't sound right for law enforcement veteran Marty Jacobson.

""She was sold a car after she went in just for an oil change,"" said Jacobson, who is now deputy regional director for the Seniors vs. Crime district that includes all Treasure Coast counties as well as Okeechobee County.

Jacobson, a longtime former officer for the Stuart Police Department, saw the sale as an obvious case of exploitation. He worked to get the deal torn up.

In cases like these, senior citizens on the Treasure Coast can get help from Seniors vs. Crime — a state agency within the Attorney General's office — set up to aid Florida's oldest residents against crimes or unfair business tactics that sometimes explicitly target them.

As Jacobson became older, he said he began to see a variety of ways senior citizens could get ripped off. Home renovations, car repair, mortician fraud and estate fraud are just some of the ways an older person can lose money.

When that happens, Seniors vs. Crime can assess the situation and determine if law enforcement should get involved or if there's other remedies.

""We differ from law enforcement in that we can mediate civil disputes,"" Jacobson said.

Volunteers for the agency, called senior sleuths, will review the cases and act on the behalf of the senior citizen to either get their money back or get the service they expected.

CLOSE The Stuart Police Department is warning residents about two new phone scams, using these calls as examples. CONTRIBUTED VIDEO FROM STUART POLICE DEPARTMENT

For example, a few years ago, an Okeechobee woman discovered a bank account had been set up in her name at a bank where she had been a member.

The bank was nonetheless seeking cash from her for an overdraw from the account. Seniors vs. Crime represented the woman and the bank agreed to not hold the woman responsible for the account, created through identity theft.

But I'm used to being embarrassed at this point,” he said.Harrouff’s attorneys plan an insanity defense.

1047,Key West woman accused of leading police on chase while 3 kids were in SUV,"Shauna Coulson, 45, of Key West, is accused of leading authorities on a chase on U.S. 1 while she had three children inside her SUV.

MARATHON, Fla. - A Key West woman was arrested Tuesday afternoon after she fled from Monroe County Sheriff's Office deputies and other law enforcement officers as they tried to pull over her SUV, authorities said.

According to Sheriff's Office spokesman Adam Linhardt, Shauna Coleen Coulson, 45, was driving the SUV recklessly while she had her three daughters inside.

According to authorities, multiple drivers called 911 beginning at 12:15 p.m. to report a silver Kia SUV being driven recklessly while heading north on U.S. 1 in Marathon.

Deputies said the SUV was driving into oncoming traffic and had its flashing yellow lights on.

According to Linhardt, drivers reported that a bag was also thrown from the SUV.

Linhardt said Key Colony Beach Officer Jefferson Rodriguez tried to pull over the vehicle at mile marker 54, but Coulson refused to pull over.

Authorities said she continued driving into oncoming traffic while reaching speeds of 75 mph, and more items were thrown from the SUV.

Deputies and officers from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission continued following the SUV until it was forced to stop after its tires were spiked on U.S. 1 at mile marker 62.5.

Linhardt said Coulson was arrested on charges of fleeing and eluding authorities and three counts of child abuse.

The three children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- were not injured and were turned over to the care of the Florida Department of Children and Families, Linhardt said.

According to an arrest report, Coulson had thick, white saliva at the edges of her mouth. Deputies said the eldest child told authorities that her mother was foaming at the mouth because she has low blood sugar. Authorities said she also said her mother asked her and her sisters to hand her stuff to throw out the window of the SUV during the chase.

According to the report, the girl said she feared for her and her sisters' lives. She also said her mother had previously stopped for water at Mote Marine and began to yell at her and her sisters to not trust anyone.

According to Linhardt, a dog and cat were also inside the SUV and were handed over to the Florida Keys Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

The animals did not appear to be injured, authorities said.

Castor, 59, will be the first openly gay mayor in the history of Tampa and the region.

With 97 precincts reporting, Castor held a lead of about 24,500 votes: 73.3% to 26.7%.

Castor ran up an overwhelming lead in early voting despite Straz’ record spending: nearly $5 million during the campaign, much of his own money, according to campaign finance reports.

At her watch party, Castor mostly thanked supporters, including outgoing Mayor Bob Buckhorn and political consultant Ana Cruz, Castor’s partner, whom she dubbed “invincible.”

1052,"Volusia Sheriff Chitwood ramps up worship patrols, encourages armed congregants","Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood has ordered extra patrols at houses of worship and also said congregants licensed to carry guns should be armed when they attend their houses of prayer.

Chitwood's directive comes after the weekend shooting at a San Diego synagogue and in the wake of two international mass killings which including a shooting in New Zealand and bombings on Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka.

As holy days and remembrances approach, local religious leaders are concerned about the safety of their congregations.

On Saturday night, a gunman at the Chabad of Poway synagogue killed a 60-year-old woman and wounded three other worshipers.

Even before this weekend, Muslim communities in DeLand and Deltona reached out to the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office in advance of Ramadan, said Chitwood, who then issued a directive to his deputies to increase their presence at religious centers.

“These extra patrols should be visual and include physically entering the establishments during services and spending time inside the institution,” Chitwood’s directive states in part.

Officials in San Diego said a 19-year-old man entered the synagogue filled with people on the last day of Passover, and opened fire with a rifle.

Jews are observing Holocaust Remembrance Week and Muslims begin their holy days of Ramadan this weekend.

Chitwood considers the Sheriff's Office security detail as a safety network that includes members of congregations.

Worshipers should report anything or anyone suspicious or out of place, the sheriff said. And bring along a weapon just in case.

Chitwood said he encourages church leaders to consider having retired law enforcement officers or people with concealed weapons licenses who are part of their congregations to come to church armed. Chitwood cited the example in Texas where an armed resident confronted an active shooter at a shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, that left 25 worshipers dead.

The Texas resident shot the suspect who was later found dead in his vehicle.

“It’s sad that we have to have this conversation since in America. We are supposed to be safe in our houses of worship,” Chitwood said. “But the reality is that we are dealing with irrational people and we don’t know when they are going to attack.”

M.L. Kaufman, senior pastor at Tubman-King Community Church in Daytona Beach, agreed with Chitwood's idea.

""That's usually the practice,"" Kaufman said, indicating armed congregation members worship at his church.

Kaufman is happy with Chitwood's plans to increase patrols and said his church has also invited the Sheriff's Office to do active shooter training at his church. The safety of churchgoers has become a priority because of ""the way society is now, with the things happening at houses of worship,"" Kaufman said.

The Florida House last week overwhelmingly approved a bill that could lead to more people with concealed weapons licenses carrying guns on the grounds of churches or other religious institutions.

Current law generally allows people with the licenses to have guns at religious institutions. But it also bars most people from having guns at schools. That has prevented people from carrying guns when churches and schools use the same property.

The law sponsored by Rep. Erin Grall, a Vero Beach Republican, would allow churches or other religious institutions to authorize people to carry guns for purposes such as security and personal protection.

In the meantime, sheriff's deputies will keep an eye on congregations.

“If these extra patrols make our communities feel safe, then I totally agree with his choices,” said Therese Cirasisi, assistant to Temple Beth-El’s Rabbi and the temple’s secretary.

Temple Beth-El will have its Community Holocaust Remembrance beginning at 7 p.m. Wednesday and temple officials have hired security for those who attend, Cirasisi said. Temple Beth-El’s protocol is to have security when more than 75 people attend the synagogue.

The temple also has a school attached to it, so security is highly important, Cirasisi said.

“We take our security very serious,” Cirasisi said. “We want everyone coming here to feel secure and safe.”

Across the county, The DeLand Islamic Center is preparing for Ramadan, which is May 5 through June 4. During Ramadan, Muslims recite special prayers, fast and refrain from life's pleasures to bring themselves closer to God.

Mohammed Amran, a DeLand Islamic Center board member, said Monday that incidents like the San Diego shooting bring fear to his fellow worshipers. In the wake of recent shootings around the world, Amran has seen fewer people coming to prayer at his mosque, he said.

The DeLand Islamic Center has wonderful neighbors but, Amran said, there is one who unnerves some who attend, yelling obscenities at Muslims. The fear of being targeted at the mosque, especially during Ramadan, is real.

“We have talked and thought of having security at our mosque but we are a small congregation and don’t have the funds for it,” Amran said. “That’s why we reached out to the sheriff and we are happy to know he is increasing patrols.”

Houses of worship will now be included of regular Sheriff's Office patrols, Chitwood said.

“We have an awful lot of churches in our jurisdiction,” Chitwood said. ”Only on Clara Avenue alone (in DeLand), we have 10 churches and on George Engram Boulevard in Daytona we have at least six churches.”

“We want our deputies to go inside, even if they are having services, and wave and say hello,"" Chitwood said.

1055,"Alachua County felons often face fees, a hurdle to restoring rights","Amendment 4 offers a path to voting for felons, but a bill would require payments first

Rodane Mickel Lamb already was a convicted felon when Alachua County detectives, after a long surveillance and multiple buys of up to a kilogram of cocaine, busted him in 2015, recovering drugs and guns. His conviction last year of racketeering, money laundering and drug trafficking came with a fine of $368,271.

It was the largest fine slapped on any convict last year in Alachua County, according to records from the Court Clerk's Office.

Few may care if he never gets his voting rights restored.

But most people convicted of felonies last year in Alachua County are not such hardened criminals. Charges include possession of small amounts of drugs, purse snatching and breaking into an unoccupied vehicle. Even so, attorney fees, court costs and fines typically total more than $600, based on an analysis of court records by The Gainesville Sun.

For someone rebuilding a life after a felony conviction, even $694 — the median amount owed to the court by convicts last year — may take a long time to pay.

Supporters of a bill in the Florida Legislature that will require payment in full before voting rights can be restored say it is following the language and intent of a constitutional amendment approved by voters in November 2018. Opponents say it is a political ploy reminiscent of Jim Crow tactics used after the Civil War.

Florida voters last year passed Amendment 4 to allow ex-felons, except for murders and rapists, to have their voting rights restored once their sentence is complete.

At issue is whether the sentence ends when the prison doors open and parole and probation served, or also when the fines and restitution ordered by judges is paid.

State Sen. Keith Perry, R-Gainesville, believes court-ordered restitution and fines must be paid before voting rights are restored. He supported the amendment during last year’s campaign.

“If someone comes and burns your house down and goes to jail for two years, they’ve paid their debt to society. But if they didn’t pay $200,000 in restitution to you, you as a victim haven’t been made whole,” Perry said. “This is court-ordered — you committed a crime and part of your sentence has to be fulfilled. Anybody who doesn’t like it should have gotten with the (Amendment 4) group and had a different amendment.”

The Rev. Ron Rawls, who advocated for the amendment in Alachua County, said the legislature is politicizing an amendment that was crafted to avoid politics.

Rawls likened it to the poll taxes of post Civil War reconstruction which kept blacks and poor whites off the voting rolls.

“This could be an opportunity for those who have made mistakes to get back involved. The majority of the voters — over 60% — want them to have that second chance, but we have politicians who have made it political,” Rawls said. “There are all kinds of ways to use legislation and laws to try to keep people in bondage. Even when people are given a second chance they are finding ways...to keep them from having full rights as a citizen.”

The Florida House of Representatives Thursday approved the bill on a largely party-line vote — Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. The Senate must approve the bill, which would become law if Gov. Ron DeSantis approves it.

The amendment summary that appeared on November ballots reads, “This amendment restores the voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete all terms of their sentence including parole or probation. The amendment would not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses, who would continue to be permanently barred from voting unless the Governor and Cabinet vote to restore their voting rights on a case by case basis.”

Alachua County Elections Supervisor Kim Barton said in a guest column in The Sun on Jan. 9 that ex-felons are eligible when they settle the monetary part of their sentence along with the prison time. She estimated Alachua County has more than 10,000 ex-felons who could qualify.

“If someone is a convicted felon who has completed all portions of his or her sentence, including probation, parole and the payment of any associated restitution, then the new voter simply needs to check the box, as his or her rights were automatically restored,” Barton said.

But the process does not end with signing the registration forms at the election office or other locations.

Florida had a registration deadline of 29 days before an election in part to give the state Division of Elections time to verify that people who register are qualified.

TJ Pyche, elections outreach director, said a part of the verification related to ex-felons has been put on hold until the legislature decides the issue of restitution.

Pyche said it is likely that some ex-felons who registered at least a month before the March 19 Gainesville city elections voted in those races.

If the proposed bill passes, paying restitution and fines can be a steep climb for many ex-felons.

The Sun got data on the financial penalties imposed on the 3,401 people convicted of felonies in Alachua County last year. It’s likely that some — if not many — have not finished their incarceration.

But once they do, the cost of fines and restitution will be daunting for some.

Data reviewed by The Sun shows that 2,092 blacks and 1,303 whites were convicted of felonies, however the disparity in fines was not so great. The median fine for black convicts was $694, and $686 for white convicts — a difference of just $8, and due to a few convicts with large fines. Only 612 women were convicted of felonies.

That maximum of $368,271 is due by a black man. The highest amount due by a white man is $55,106. The highest amount due by a woman is $3,651.

Both sides agree a final decision in favor of requiring payment of restitution and fines won’t be the end of the issue. Court challenges are possible.

“I know that since February we’ve been contacting politicians and making appeals. It’s almost like the campaign. After this, I’m pretty sure there’s going to be some battle in the courts,” Rawls said.

Said Perry, “Certainly it could face a court challenge, anybody can bring a lawsuit.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190427/alachua-county-felons-often-face-fees-hurdle-to-restoring-rights?rssfeed=true,2019-04-27T15:05:54Z,Gainesville Sun,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608

1057,16 people killed in police raid on home of suspected terrorists in Sri Lanka,"Advertisement 16 people killed in police raid on home of suspected terrorists in Sri Lanka Share Shares Copy Link Copy

At least 16 people -- including six children -- are dead and two suspected terrorists on the run after a shootout between police and alleged militants in eastern Sri Lanka late Friday, authorities said.At daybreak, a gruesome scene was revealed at the raided house in the town of Sainthamaruthu on the country's eastern coast -- charred bodies and the roof entirely blown off during three explosions.Among those killed, six are suspected terrorists and 10 are civilians -- including one woman who was passing on a rickshaw at the time of the raid. Police are investigating the possible relationship of the civilians to the suspected terrorists.Earlier on Friday, authorities seized a large cache of explosives, 100,000 ball bearings and ISIS uniforms and flags from a separate garage a few miles from the shootout.The raids come on the back of a major hunt for the perpetrators of the coordinated attacks on Easter Sunday, which killed 253 people, including many worshipers attending Easter Mass services.National Tawheed Jamath (NTJ), a local extremist group, has been blamed for the bombings, but has not claimed the attacks. ISIS claimed responsibility, but a link between the attackers and the terror group has not been proven.One wounded suspect fled on a motorbike, and another suspected terrorist could be on the run as well, Maj. Gen. Aruna Jayasekera said.One of the six suspected terrorists found dead has been identified as Mohamed Niyas, known to the authorities as a prominent member of the NTJ. Earlier in a statement from the army, Niyas was identified as the brother-in-law of the alleged ringleader of the Easter Sunday attacks, Zahran Hashim.According to neighbor Aliyar Mohamed, who lives opposite the alleged bomb-making garage, the building was rented to people from Kattankudy, a town around an hour's drive north from Sainthamaruthu.""The owners then realized there was suspicious stuff going on here, then police came here. The place was rented out two to three weeks ago,"" he told CNN.""They (the tenants) came here claiming to start a slipper factory, and the owners saw the materials but didn't understand what they were. But after the Colombo bombings, and with the people being from Kattankudy, they then reported them to police.""The eastern cities of Kalmunai, Chavalakade and Sammanthurai remain under extended curfew until further notice, according to police. The curfew on these cities was imposed after the shootout. Amid an ongoing police operation at the shootout site, around 600 nearby households -- mainly Muslim -- have been evacuated to a local school currently under guard by security forces.One of the evacuees, Mohamed Feleel, told CNN that he heard the first bomb blast at around 7.15pm. The father-of-10 said the explosions and gunfire continued for over four hours until eventually the village was evacuated at 6 a.m. Saturday morning.""I was afraid, I stayed inside as there were people firing, people getting killed,"" said Feleel, who has so far only been given water and biscuits at the school.""Now at night I won't be sleeping, I'm too afraid."" The raid comes as the Sri Lankan government announced Friday that anyone found guilty of spreading false information may be imprisoned for up to three to five years.It added that a number of public disturbances have been reported in several parts of the country, due to the circulation of false information in the wake of the Easter Sunday bombings.A ban on social media that was implemented following the attacks, will remain in place due to ""a lot of wrong information shared,"" President Maithripala Sirisena said Friday.Meanwhile Sri Lankan authorities have been attempting to root out ""sleeper"" cells that could initiate another round of attacks, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told CNN on Thursday.""Every household in the country will be checked,"" President Maithripala Sirisena told a news conference, according to a statement. ""The lists of permanent residents of every house will be established to ensure no unknown persons could live anywhere.""The heightened tensions have put Sri Lankans on edge.Catholic Sunday masses have been suspended ""until further notice"" in Sri Lanka, the Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith announced Friday. He said the move will ensure the safety of the worshipers, and the church ""will try to introduce some services"" once better security was in place.The government urged Muslims to stay at home for Friday prayers, and many mosques were closed. However, some mosques defied the call, opening for the midday prayers.Both Christianity and Islam are minority religions in Sri Lanka, each accounting for under 10% of the total population. The vast majority of Sri Lankans identify as Buddhist.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/16-people-killed-in-police-raid-on-home-of-suspected-terrorists-in-sri-lanka/27292185,2019-04-27T10:54:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
1058,"U.S. Rep. Brian Mast to introduce 'Harmony's Law,' named after Port St. Lucie woman","Harmony Allen was raped in 2000 while she was stationed in the Air Force. Her attacker, Richard Collins, who was a Sergeant was found guilty of rape and sentenced to 16 years in prison. This month he was freed based on a ruling in U.S. v. Mangahas (Photo: COURTESY OF U.S. CONGRESSMAN BRIAN MAST)

PORT ST. LUCIE — Harmony Allen's attacker beat and raped her when she was 19 while she was stationed at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas; in 2017 he was found guilty and was expected to be jailed for 16 years.

But this month, Richard Collins is a free man. He served 2 1/2 years behind bars.

Because of a February 2018 ruling by a U.S. military appeals court in U.S. v. Mangahas, there's a five-year statute of limitations for sexual assaults that happened before 2006.

As a result, starting last year, convicted sexual offenders in the military can appeal their convictions and be set free if they committed the offense before 2006 but were not charged within five years.

U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Palm City, announced Friday morning he's introducing ""Harmony's Law"" legislation. If passed, it will eliminate the statute of limitations for sexual assaults that happen before 2006.

Allen, of Port St. Lucie, told police about how the sergeant violated her in 2000, but didn't tell anyone Collins' name until she left the Air Force 11 years later.

Collins said she was silent for so long about Collins' name because he outranked her and threatened to kill her if she told anyone what happened, she said.

""Because I didn't want to name my rapist, I was told that I wanted it,"" she said. ""It was horrible the way they made me feel.""

She said she notified the Air Force base about the incident when it happened as well as multiple times in her 11 years of service, but nothing ever came out of the reports.

In the military, we're afraid because we're working with our rapists, so we don't come forward until after we're transferred to another duty station, she said.

""We might not get transferred until five years later, and due to that we didn't come forward within five years,"" Allen said.

Harmony's rapist was set free ""because of an absurd appeals court ruling that directly contradicts Congress' intent to hold military members who commit rape accountable,"" Mast said during a news conference at Port St. Lucie City Hall.

""This is a massive miscarriage of justice for Harmony and many others, which is why Congress needs to intervene to prevent possibly hundreds of rapists from being set free without repercussion.""

Allen said the sexual assault happened one night after she drove Collins home.

She was eating in a general area on the Sheppard Air Force Base when Collins started talking to her. He began to drink heavily, she said, so she suggested he should take a shuttle or a get a ride home.

When Collins refused, Allen drove him home, where, she said, he assaulted her and beat her excessively.

Allen said with Collins out of jail, all of the fear that she felt the 16 years leading up to him being sentenced is back.

She said she constantly worries that he'll come back and kill her for the years he spent behind bars or that he'll come after her daughter for revenge.

1059,Daytona police arrest serial rapist linked to 7 attacks,"Markeith Martin, 44, of Daytona Beach, was charged with sexual battery in Aug. 1, 2018 attack. Police hope to charge him in more rapes in Daytona and Holly Hill.

DAYTONA BEACH — A homeless man with a ""horrific criminal history"" and who has been linked to seven rapes in the area was captured Friday by police following a two-day manhunt, Daytona Beach Police Chief Craig Capri said.

Markeith ""Shawn"" Martin, 44, a felon who has been in and out of prison for a decade, admitted to forcibly raping women on the streets of Daytona Beach, Capri said. Martin also has been linked to a rape investigation in Holly Hill, according to police.

[READ MORE: Deputies: Woman attacked, raped on beach near Daytona Beach Shores]

""We hit the streets looking for him (Wednesday) and we were able to track him down today,"" Capri said.

Martin was convicted in 2015 on a charge of aggravated battery with intent to harm, for which he was sentenced to 37 months in prison. Martin originally was charged with sexual battery in that case when he was arrested in July 2014. Capri referred to that incident during a media conference Friday.

""The victim is scarred from this for life and this guy gets 37 months to be back on the streets and (rape) again,"" Capri said.

Capri originally said Martin was linked to five rapes in the area, but Sgt. Kelsey Harris, a police spokesman, said after the media conference that detectives have connected the suspect to a total of seven rapes. More investigative work still needs to be done, but Martin is suspected of committing one rape in 2010, two in 2014, one in 2017 and two in 2018, in addition to the Holly Hill case, Harris said.

He was booked Friday afternoon at the Volusia County Branch Jail on one count of sexual battery in connection with one of the reported rapes from 2018.

During the morning of Aug. 1, a woman was riding her bicycle in the 200 block of North Peninsula Drive when her brakes locked up on her, according to a police report. The woman, whose name and age were redacted from the report, was approached by Martin, who offered her assistance.

After she declined, Martin asked her whether she wanted any crack-cocaine, police said. After she declined that offer, Martin grabbed her by the throat, threw her to the ground and sexually battered her, the report stated.

The woman told detectives that Martin threatened to stab her if she resisted his advances, police said.

After he raped her, Martin became ""apologetic"" and asked the woman whether she thought he was a bad person for what he did to her, the report stated. Martin helped her with the bicycle and offered to take her out later to make up for what he did, police said.

The pair walked to the area of Hollywood Avenue where Martin walked away from the woman. That's when she left her bicycle in a random yard and ran to get help, according to the report.

Police said they called the woman Friday to let her know they caught the suspect, who was linked to the crime through DNA evidence.

During his interview with detectives Friday, Martin was ""graphic in his details"" when he confessed to his crimes, Capri told reporters. Detectives said Martin would offer his victims drugs and if they refused, he would have to ""get rough with them.""

Capri called it ""frustrating"" that Martin was not a registered sex offender, especially after his 2015 conviction. Had he been, police officers would have been monitoring him, which could have led to an arrest sooner, he said.

Martin has been a fixture along Ridgewood Avenue, in an area known for prostitution. He's been arrested for battery and other charges while hanging around Ridgewood, but he has also been seen by the road holding a lantern and praying with other homeless people in the area.

In August 2017, Martin was charged with aggravated battery after punching and choking a woman, who told police that she had previously dated Martin. She also said he had once served as her pimp, according to an arrest report. The charge was reduced to misdemeanor battery and he was found guilty. He was sentenced to 364 days in jail.

Capri called Martin ""deranged."" He also said the suspect has been charged a total of 44 times with 23 of those charges being felonies.

Holly Hill Police Chief Steve Aldrich said he couldn't disclose too many details about the rape investigation involving his agency, but confirmed that his detectives are meeting next week with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to discuss the case.

""Obviously, he's a guy who needs to be off the street,"" Aldrich said of Martin.

He was arraigned Thursday, pleaded not guilty and is being held on $1 million cash bail, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Tim Sini.The Legal Aid Society of Suffolk County, which is representing Rodio, had no comment when contacted by CNN. Rodio faces a maximum of 25 years in prison if he is convicted.Rodio mainly targeted vulnerable women in their 20s who were addicted to drugs, Sini said. The ring allegedly ran between December 2014 and February 2019, and Sini said about 20 women were victims.Sini said Rodio would initially provide the women with drugs like heroin and crack cocaine for free. ""He would then hold their addictions, their diseases, over their heads to force them to work with him,"" Sini said. ""He would initially supply many of these women with drugs for free so that they would develop a dependency on him. After he set up prostitution dates for his victims, he would provide them with heroin or crack cocaine in order to impair their judgment.""'A dungeon'Once inside Rodio's family home, Sini said victims were not allowed to go anywhere except the basement, which had a lock on the door and no bathroom. Victims were forced to use a bucket to relieve themselves.""He used the basement of his parents' home as a dungeon,"" Sini said.Authorities allege that Rodio advertised for prostitution services by the women on websites like Backpage and Craigslist, and that he would keep a large percentage, if not all, of the money the women earned.Sini said that Rodio, too, frequently used crack cocaine, and would sometimes drive them to meetings at nearby hotels himself.If the women refused a ""prostitution date,"" Rodio would allegedly threaten them with physical violence or by threatening to withhold drugs from them, ""which would result in them suffering from the withdrawal,"" Sini said.Father denies ring run out of basementRodio's parents lived at the family's Sound Beach, New York, home while the alleged crimes occurred, Sini said, adding that authorities did not believe the parents themselves engaged in criminal activity.""There's some indication that they were aware that something untoward was going on, but they're not charged with any crimes,"" Sini said.CNN spoke to Rodio's father, Ray Rodio II, on the phone, who denied that his son was running a sex-trafficking ring out of the family's basement.""No, he wasn't, he wasn't doing anything out of the basement -- he was doing drugs,"" Rodio's father told CNN.Rodio's father told CNN that he believed his son suffers from a drug addiction, which has negatively affected his family.""He's not innocent, OK, he needs help,"" Rodio's father said. ""I've been trying to get him help.""Training led to discoverySini said authorities were tipped off to the possibility of a human-trafficking ring in August, when Suffolk County Police officers conducted a routine traffic stop.The officers are trained to look for signs of human trafficking -- a younger woman riding in a car with a much older man, and if ""the woman looks like she's been through hell and back.""""The average person -- a healthy individual with a social network that isn't addicted to drugs -- is not likely to be targeted for human trafficking,"" Sini told reporters. ""It's people who are down on their luck. And that's what we saw here.""That training led officers to one of the victims of Rodio's alleged sex-trafficking ring, Sini said.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/authorities-say-man-ran-sex-trafficking-ring-out-of-his-parents-basement-for-years/27280343,2019-04-26T09:44:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
1063,Suppression hearing scheduled in alleged sex spa video involving Patriots owner Robert Kraft,"CLOSE A seldom used ""sneak and peek"" warrant was used to install hidden cameras in the massage parlors involved in the Florida sex spa scandal. Now the question is: Will the videotaped evidence hold up in court? Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

Editor's note: For a live Twitter feed from court, scroll down

PALM BEACH COUNTY — Attorneys for New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft are expected in court today to argue why video purporting to show Kraft getting sex services from women in January at a Jupiter spa should be suppressed in his criminal case.

The 9:30 a.m. hearing before County Judge Leonard Hanser comes after a number of legal filings in which Kraft’s attorneys have attacked the legality of a “sneak and peek” warrant obtained by Jupiter police in allowing investigators to install covert security cameras in Orchids of Asia Day Spa.

Also expected to be discussed is a motion by prosecutors to do away with 26 subpoenas for 22 law enforcement officers and four Department of Health workers, saying proper procedures weren’t followed.

More: Robert Kraft video evidence to be sealed until jury is seated or case is otherwise resolved

The case involving Orchids of Asia began being disclosed Feb. 19 at a media briefing at the Martin County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff William Snyder said his agency targeted four spas in Martin County and spoke of the cases in the context of human trafficking.

Investigators were led to Orchids of Asia in the neighboring Palm Beach County community of Jupiter, where covert surveillance cameras were installed after investigators got a warrant.

Kraft's alleged involvement in the case was disclosed days later. Kraft, 77, is accused of getting sex services on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20.

Four women, including the two accused of supplying sex services to Kraft, also have been arrested..

Hanser on April 23 entered an order stating the videos should be protected until juries have been sworn in; the case is resolved by plea; the charges are dropped; or at any other time the court determines their release wouldn’t harm Kraft’s right to a fair trial.

In court April 12, Assistant State Attorney Greg Kridos said at the outset of the investigation into Orchids of Asia, there appeared to be human trafficking involved but as the case went on, and after evaluating the evidence, there didn’t appear to be human trafficking.

More: Police snuck cameras into massage parlors years before Robert Kraft charged with soliciting prostitution

Kraft’s lawyers have argued the video recordings are ""fruits of an unlawful"" search warrant. They also said law enforcement “defied established Fourth Amendment limits on video surveillance.”

Kraft’s lawyers have said a Jupiter police detective “tapped” a Florida Department of Health investigator on Nov. 14 to go in the spa “specifically to further the criminal investigation.”

More: Woman accused of providing sex services to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft arrested

They also said an affidavit from the detective was “calculated to mislead (a judge) into believing that the alleged low-level prostitution at the spa was actually part of a much more serious and widespread crime: human trafficking.”

They argued in filings law enforcement officials didn’t exhaust more minimally invasive methods of investigation, saying they did no undercover work and didn’t try to talk to spa employees or former employees.

More:Client in Robert Kraft sex spa case sues over video, says civil rights violated

Further, they have said the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and state law set “limits on how far law enforcement can go and under what circumstances.”

“Those limits were flouted in this case,” a filing said.

In a motion to strike down the suppression motion, prosecutors said Kraft’s lawyers didn’t address the crime of deriving support from the proceeds of prostitution. They said that is the only crime a judge relied on.

They also criticized Kraft’s lawyers’ arguments about rights to privacy, citing case law involving where people can and cannot have expectations of privacy.

More: 31 male, female customers videotaped at spa Robert Kraft also visited sue over recordings

They argued because Kraft was in a business and his purpose “was to conduct a business transaction,” he has no valid claim to an expectation of privacy. Even less so, they argue, because he was there “to conduct criminal business transactions.”

A serious crash with injuries shut down a portion of Hancock Bridge Parkway on Wednesday.

Neighbors who heard the crash said four people were involved. The crash ended with a black SUV against a tree and a silver passenger car atop the SUV. Both vehicles had partially toppled several trees in the median.

Hannah Britt, 17, who lives across from the crash scene, said a man involved in the crash was ""lying on the grass and screaming. He had blood all over him.""

Britt said there were two females in one vehicle and a male and female had been in the other.

""I heard the squeal and then a loud crash,"" Britt said. ""I ran out and said 'Oh, my gosh'. Immediately I ran inside and called 911.""

Britt said traffic is normally heavy on that part of Hancock.

""I couldn't believe it,"" Britt said. ""When I first heard the tires squeal I thought someone swerved in front of somebody. But when I heard the crash I knew something was wrong.""

Sarah Nicol, 18, who lives down the block from the crash, was just coming home from school when she saw the mass of metal stuck in trees in the median.

""One girl had blood all over her face, she was freaking out,"" Nicol said. ""My dad was trying to calm her down.""

The crash closed down Hancock Bridge Parkway from Cultural Park Boulevard to Southeast 5th Avenue. Cape Coal police said the crash would likely keep Hancock closed for several hours.

Drivers were asked to avoid the area and seek and alternate route until 3:45 p.m.

Further information on the crash from Cape Coral police was not available.

Jessica Garcia of Apopka also was ordered Tuesday to pay a share of more than $750,000 in restitution to victims of the business known as Parcelnomics LLC or Investment Deals.

Garcia and co-defendant Jack Leal pleaded guilty in April 2017 to felony fraud charges.

Leal was sentenced in August 2017 to six-to-15 years in state prison.

Garcia's lawyer, Gabriel Grasso, said her sentencing was postponed several times while she worked to make restitution to the victims. Grasso said he's disappointed she didn't receive credit for those efforts.

But the attorney acknowledged that Garcia also failed to appear for sentencing in 2017 and was arrested several months later in Florida.

State Attorney General Aaron Ford said that from March 2015 to March 2016 Garcia and Leal falsely represented that properties their victims bought were clear of liens and other security interests.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190424/woman-gets-prison-in-nevada-property-investment-scam?rssfeed=true,2019-04-24T16:28:03Z,The Ledger,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA",FL,33815

1077,Vero police keep chalking tires while Michigan court deals with whether it's unconstitutional,"CLOSE Street parking on Ocean Drive is seen in drone aerial video about 3 p.m. on April 12, 2019, in Vero Beach. Parking varies widely. Xavier Mascareñas and Maureen Kenyon, Treasure Coast Newspapers

VERO BEACH — Most frequent visitors to the downtown or beachside businesses are familiar with the yellow chalk line that appears on their tires.

And the $20 parking ticket that appears on their windshield if the chalk line remains when the city parking officer returns after two or three hours.

A Michigan woman, who has received 15 tickets in Saginaw within the past three years, claims those chalk lines constitute an unreasonable search of her car.

The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agrees with her in part — the chalk marks do constitute a search, because the officer trespasses on the car to make the marks.

But whether tire chalking is an unreasonable search has been sent back to the original Michigan district court to decide.

More: Vero Beach City Council looking to solve beachside parking problem with engineering study

It's up to the plaintiff, Alison Taylor, to show the courts why chalking tires should be prohibited and why it is an unreasonable search, said Florida State University College of Law assistant professor Michael Morley.

The court has to decide whether officers need a search warrant or whether the law allows an exemption in this case, he said.

But no matter which way the Michigan court rules, it's unlikely to have any local impact in Florida, said Morley.

If the Michigan case is sent back to the federal appeals court, any ruling would only affect those Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee residents within the court's jurisdiction. Florida is in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court district.

Parties involved could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, but Morley said the high court usually only reviews when there are contradicting decisions from different appeals courts.

""There really isn't much precedence on this issue,"" he said.

Parking has been a source of contention particularly on the beachside, where business owners complain hotel and restaurant employees take valuable parking spots away from their customers.

City Council has considered parking kiosks, shuttles and increasing fines to address the issue.

City officials are awaiting the results of a parking study that could recommend ways to ease the parking problem, Currey said.

Last month, Vero Beach City Council authorized the study, to be conducted by Raleigh, North Carolina-based Kimley-Horn in two phases. After the first phase, which will cost $31,000, the council will decide whether to implement the $40,000 second phase.

The first phase, the data collection phase, is expected to define the parking problem. Mayor Val Zudans said the consultant could meet with staff next week to get input before finalizing its phase one report.

Costs could be a factor in how solutions are implemented, he said.

Software and equipment are available that would allow officers to electronically mark a parked car, but that can be costly, Currey said.

""We've looked at other alternatives,"" Currey said.

1078,Ocala DUI suspect arrested after fatal wrong-way crash,"Shawn Christian St. Lawrence, 34, faces charges of DUI manslaughter and DUI with property damage.

An Ocala man was arrested Thursday in connection with a wrong-way crash in January that killed a woman on her way to work.

The head-on collision on South U.S. 301 in Summerfield claimed the life of Marilyn Ortega Ortiz, 47, of Marion Oaks.

Shawn Christian St. Lawrence, 34, turned himself in at the Marion County Jail, where he was charged with DUI manslaughter and DUI with property damage. St. Lawrence was booked at 2:32 p.m. and released at 3:27 p.m. on $32,500 bond.

St. Lawrence declined to speak with Cpl. Mark Baker, the Florida Highway Patrol trooper who investigated the crash.

St. Lawrence is represented by local attorney Melanie Slaughter. She told the Star-Banner on Friday that she had not received any paperwork and, therefore, could not comment.

After the crash, St. Lawrence was taken to Ocala Regional Medical Center. FHP officials obtained a subpoena for his medical records. Blood taken from St. Lawrence was sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for testing.

Results showed ablood alcohol content of .210 and .212. The state's legal limit is .08.

""I'm glad he was arrested,"" said Ivette Ortega, sister of the crash victim. St. Lawrence's actions were ""irresponsible,"" she said.

According to FHP, Ortiz's car was struck head-on by St. Lawrence's vehicle shortly before 10:30 p.m. on the night of Jan. 3. Family members said Ortiz was on the way to her second job, at Signature Brands, when her 2003 Honda Civic was hit.

Troopers said Ortiz was traveling north on U.S. 301 in the inside lane, just south of Southeast 132nd Street Road. St. Lawrence, driving a 2001 BMW 535I, was stopped in the outside northbound lane of U.S. 301, facing south at the intersection of Southeast 132nd Street Road.

FHP officials said the BMW traveled south in the northbound lanes. Ortiz tried to avoid the crash by swerving to the left, into the left turn lane, but the vehicles collided.

Ortiz was pronounced dead at the scene. St. Lawrence was taken to ORMC with serious injuries.

At the time, Esteban Perez, a witness, told the Star-Banner he noticed the BMW was in the wrong lane and used the flashlight on his cellphone to get the driver’s attention and let him know he was going the wrong way. But, Perez said, as he approached the vehicle, the light changed and the BMW sped off.

Ortiz's family said that, although the mother of three worked two jobs, she always found time to laugh and be with her children and other family members. She was a black belt who loved karate, a happy person who enjoyed the outdoors.

Ivette Ortega said that, despite losing her sister, she is asking God to ""have mercy"" on St. Lawrence. For both sides, she said, the process is a long one.

""We're taking it day-by-day. Its been sad and our hearts are still broken,"" she said. ""You never expect something like that.""

1079,Livestream: 'Touchdown Jesus' move raises detective's suspicions at Jupiter spa,"Editor's note: For a live Twitter feed from court, scroll down

PALM BEACH COUNTY — Detective Andrew Sharp of the Jupiter Police Department was questioned for about two hours Friday before an afternoon break in the court hearing in the Robert Kraft case.

The New England Patriots owner is accused of getting sex services twice in January.

Much of attorney Alex Spiro’s questioning centered about the surveillance techniques and investigative processes and methods Sharp and Jupiter police used in the Orchids of Asia Day Spa case.

Spiro also spent considerable time pointing out similarities between Sharp’s warrant and one used by Martin County sheriff’s investigators, who searched four spas in their jurisdiction and made dozens of arrests.

Sharp said he goes to Wednesday Martin County intelligence meetings.

“During those meetings, it was brought to my attention that they were working an investigation and they believed that there was ties in their investigation to our investigation in Palm Beach County,” he said.

Sharp said mostly men were seen coming from Orchids of Asia, situated in a plaza near U.S. 1 and Indiantown Road.

“There was one evening in question where a group of approximately eight males got off of a golf cart, walked into the establishment, came back outside … did sort of an … touchdown Jesus .. and then walked back inside,” Sharp said.

“At that point I understood that this was not just a regular massage parlor but one that was an illicit massage business.”

Spiro asked Sharp whether he’d been inside and he said he had.

“It’s a nice, clean place, right?” Spiro said.

“I don’t know about clean,’’ Sharp replied.

Friday's hearing was scheduled for Kraft's attorneys to argue why video purporting to show Kraft getting sex services from women at the spa should be suppressed in his criminal case.

The hearing before County Judge Leonard Hanser comes after a number of legal filings in which Kraft’s attorneys have attacked the legality of a “sneak and peek” warrant obtained by Jupiter police in allowing investigators to install covert security cameras in Orchids of Asia Day Spa.

Also expected to be discussed is a motion by prosecutors to do away with 26 subpoenas for 22 law enforcement officers and four Department of Health workers, saying proper procedures weren’t followed.

The case involving Orchids of Asia began being disclosed Feb. 19 at a media briefing at the Martin County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff William Snyder said his agency targeted four spas in Martin County and spoke of the cases in the context of human trafficking.

Investigators were led to Orchids of Asia in the neighboring Palm Beach County community of Jupiter, where covert surveillance cameras were installed after investigators got a warrant.

1080,LIVE: 'Touchdown Jesus' move raises detective's suspicions over what was happening at Jupiter spa,"Editor's note: For a live Twitter feed from court, scroll down

PALM BEACH COUNTY — Detective Andrew Sharp of the Jupiter Police Department was questioned for about two hours Friday before an afternoon break in the court hearing in the Robert Kraft case.

The New England Patriots owner is accused of getting sex services twice in January.

Much of attorney Alex Spiro’s questioning centered about the surveillance techniques and investigative processes and methods Sharp and Jupiter police used in the Orchids of Asia Day Spa case.

Spiro also spent considerable time pointing out similarities between Sharp’s warrant and one used by Martin County sheriff’s investigators, who searched four spas in their jurisdiction and made dozens of arrests.

Sharp said he goes to Wednesday Martin County intelligence meetings.

“During those meetings, it was brought to my attention that they were working an investigation and they believed that there was ties in their investigation to our investigation in Palm Beach County,” he said.

Sharp said mostly men were seen coming from Orchids of Asia, situated in a plaza near U.S. 1 and Indiantown Road.

“There was one evening in question where a group of approximately eight males got off of a golf cart, walked into the establishment, came back outside … did sort of an … touchdown Jesus .. and then walked back inside,” Sharp said.

“At that point I understood that this was not just a regular massage parlor but one that was an illicit massage business.”

Spiro asked Sharp whether he’d been inside and he said he had.

“It’s a nice, clean place, right?” Spiro said.

“I don’t know about clean,’’ Sharp replied.

Friday's hearing was scheduled for Kraft's attorneys to argue why video purporting to show Kraft getting sex services from women at the spa should be suppressed in his criminal case.

The hearing before County Judge Leonard Hanser comes after a number of legal filings in which Kraft’s attorneys have attacked the legality of a “sneak and peek” warrant obtained by Jupiter police in allowing investigators to install covert security cameras in Orchids of Asia Day Spa.

Also expected to be discussed is a motion by prosecutors to do away with 26 subpoenas for 22 law enforcement officers and four Department of Health workers, saying proper procedures weren’t followed.

The case involving Orchids of Asia began being disclosed Feb. 19 at a media briefing at the Martin County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff William Snyder said his agency targeted four spas in Martin County and spoke of the cases in the context of human trafficking.

Investigators were led to Orchids of Asia in the neighboring Palm Beach County community of Jupiter, where covert surveillance cameras were installed after investigators got a warrant.

Kraft's alleged involvement in the case was disclosed days later. Kraft, 77, is accused of getting sex services on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20.

1085,Desperate Facebook post leads to kidney donation from stranger,"Vicki Pentecost says she got her life back thanks to the generosity of Art Fales.

EUSTIS, Fla. - Vicki Pentecost sat in her living room looking at her phone. She shook her head.

""Wow, that still gets me every time,"" she said, taking a deep breath.

She was looking at a Facebook post she made more than a year ago. Reading the words, she still couldn't believe the odds that her desperate plea for a kidney on social media would be answered.

""Only one person came forward and took the test,"" she said. ""They were a perfect match. Odd, no, that was God.""

She's talking about Art Foles, this week's Getting Results Award winner. The two had never met but their online social circles overlapped long enough to change both of their lives. Now she calls him her angel.

""I almost died. I shouldn't be here today,"" Pentecost said. ""So to be able to have my life back is just a gift. All because of Art.""

Pentecost was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2016. Before she knew it, she was doing dialysis three times a week.

""I couldn't imagine living my life on a machine,"" Pentecost said, reflecting on her options at that time.

No one in her family was an option for a transplant.

""And so I thought, 'Well, I'll put my name on the kidney transplant list,'"" she said.

That's when someone suggested she make a post on Facebook.

""I said, 'I don't know.' I thought about it for a while,"" Pentecost said.

A friend of Pentecost's oldest daughter saw the message and asked her husband, Fales, if he could help.

""I said, 'If we're a match, I don't have a problem.' It was an easy decision,"" Fales remembered saying.

The successful operation took place in December at UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville.

Pentecost hopes her story will encourage others to consider organ donation.

For more information on organ donation please visit the TransLife website. TransLife is the federally-designated organ procurement organization for 10 counties in East Central Florida.

Pentecost and Foles now consider themselves family. The two and their families meet regularly.

""I'm a giving person. I like to think of others before myself,"" Foles said. ""Anytime somebody needs help, if I can, I'll be there.""

1086,"Deputies: Dogs, birds, bedridden woman found living in trash, feces; Dunedin man arrested","- A Dunedin man has been arrested for the abuse and neglect of an elderly, disabled person - and the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office says it's his second arrest for alleged abuse of the same victim.

Deputies who were following up on a welfare check of the victim described a home filled with trash and feces, as well as emaciated dogs, puppies living in bins filled with their own feces, birds flying freely, rats, bugs, and overall unsanitary conditions.

The victim, a 67-year-old bedridden woman, and multiple animals were removed from the home.

Pinellas County deputies arrested Richard Lawrence Goodwin, 65, of Dunedin, Thursday. Deputies were conducting a welfare check after an incident the previous day. The sheriff's office did not describe the nature of the incident that prompted the follow-up.

Deputies said they were able to smell rotting trash and animal feces as they walked up the driveway to the home. The sheriff's office said the smell inside was ""so overwhelming that deputies had to [wear] masks.""

Continue reading below

According to the sheriff's office, the toilets were ""overflowing with feces"" and the only working sink was near Goodwin's living quarters - across the home from where the victim stayed.

To reach the victim, deputies said they had to clear a path through the piles of trash in the home.

As they walked through the house, deputies said rats, cockroaches, and ants ran across the floors. They also saw spiders, flies, mosquitoes, and black-colored mold on surfaces, the sheriff's office said.

Pinellas County Animals Services were called to rescue skinny and emaciated dogs and two puppies that were "" living in a plastic bin that was nearly two inches deep with their own feces."" Five macaws were said to be loose in the home and were also taken by animal services.

Deputies said there was no food or water available for the victim or the animals.

The bedridden woman was taken to the hospital and was said to have non-life threating injuries. The State of Florida Elderly Abuse Hotline was notified of the conditions.

Goodwin faces one count of abuse/neglect of the aged/disabled and two counts of cruelty to animals.

1091,"'Hurry up, he's got a rifle:' 911 calls released in Walgreens armed robbery","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - Frantic employees called 911 begging for help after a paranoid man armed with a rifle jumped the pharmacy counter at a Walgreens Tuesday afternoon, according to the Daytona Beach Police Department.

Three women who work at the store called 911. Two of them made it out of the pharmacy safely while a third hid inside an office.

""He started jumping the counter and my pharmacist came and went toward him and I ran out of the pharmacy, and as I was running out I saw him pull out the gun, and I just ran and got people out of the store,"" a pharmacy technician said through tears.

The employee who was still inside the store did not realize at first that the man had a firearm. Once she did, panic struck.

""He's got a rifle. Hurry up, he's got a rifle,"" the woman yelled.

Surveillance video released Tuesday evening shows the man, later identified as Louis Curler, holding a backpack as he jumps over the counter. When a pharmacist approaches, he pulls out a gun and continues to demand drugs, the footage shows.

""It's a big huge gun. It's very, very large,"" a woman told 911.

All three women offered similar accounts, saying Curler was alone there for about 10 minutes demanding drugs.

""He was saying that people were after him. He said people were after him, he needs help,"" one woman said.

The witnesses told operators that Curler claimed he had just been released from a hospital and doctors there had been giving him drugs.

The pharmacist who was held at gunpoint gave Curler oxycodone along with a syringe, according to the arrest report. While Curler injected the drugs, the pharmacist ran to take cover moments before officers stormed the store.

Surveillance video shows officers firing at the armed man as he was crouched behind the pharmacy counter. Police said Curler pointed the loaded rifle at an investigator. Curler was shot in the back.

No one else was injured during the incident and Curler, 41, never fired his weapon, according to authorities.

He faces charges of robbery with a firearm and kidnapping.

1093,"Florida Time: Racism, resentment and injustice against Black Floridians","We’ve said that Florida is now the most “northern” of the southern states. Its Jewish and Hispanic populations are among the largest in the nation and each boasts its own diversity.

The state has had Hispanic members of the U.S. House and Senate as well as regional and state elected officials from every ethnic group imaginable. A lieutenant governor and the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor were African-American.

But in the late 1800s and early 1900s, Florida was fiercely Southern. And like much of the South, to its shame, deeply embraced Jim Crow.

So what was the extent of Jim Crow in early 20th century Florida?

There were people who didn’t look like the Pilgrims and who hadn’t come voluntarily. The end of the Civil War was supposed to have made them full citizens. That ideal slammed head-on into the reality of racism and resentment.

It wasn’t just separate water fountains and restrooms, which this writer remembers seeing as a child in Miami in the 1960s. That was mild. From 1918 to 1927 alone, 416 blacks were lynched nationwide. Of those murders, 47 were in Florida.

And while lynchings are one thing, massacres are something else.

On New Year’s Day of 1923, a 22-year-old white woman named Fannie Taylor told the sheriff in Levy County, west of Ocala, that a black man had assaulted her. Soon a mob of between 400 and 500 people was searching the woods around Rosewood, a community of about 300 black families. After seven days of violence, six blacks and two whites had been killed and Rosewood had been burned to the ground.

A 1993 investigation commissioned by the state would call it “a tragedy of American democracy and the American legal system.”

As dramatic as that massacre was, another incident became nothing less than a sideshow of the Cold War.

In 1949, four black men were accused of raping a white woman outside Groveland, in Lake County, north of Orlando. One man was killed by a mob a few days later. The other three were tried and convicted. After the St. Petersburg Times published articles showing distances and timing that made the men’s guilt physically impossible, and when future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, then with the NAACP, stepped in, a retrial was ordered. The Lake County sheriff drove to the prison to get the boys and shot two of them while they “escaped” as he changed a flat. One died. The surviving two were convicted again. One served 19 years, one 12. The Soviet Union would gleefully make propaganda hay, arguing freedom-loving Americans were hypocrites.

Other individual miscarriages of justice against black Floridians are too numerous to mention. And that’s the ones we know about.

1095,Report: Woman who fatally stabbed 11-year-old daughter punches officer in jail cell,"ORLANDO, Fla. - A Florida woman accused of killing her 11-year-old daughter to keep her from having sex with men attacked a corrections officer at the Orange County Jail, according to a report.

Orange County officials said Rosa Alcides Rivera, 28, punched the officer earlier this month when the officer entered Rovera's jail cell to check on her after hearing a report of a possible injured inmate, the report said.

The officer said Rivera had just taken her IV out against orders and was sitting in her cell before she stood up and hit the officer on the left side of her face.

[RELATED: Woman with knife brings dead daughter to Orlando hospital, police say | Woman kills 11-year-old daughter to keep her from having sex, deputies say]

Rivera is facing charges of battery on a corrections officer, in addition to first-degree murder charges she faced in connection with her daughter's death last month.

Authorities said Rivera stabbed her daughter, Aleyda, at least 15 times in a car March 10 and drove her around before bringing her to a hospital in Orlando. By then, the child was already dead, officials said.

Deputies with the Orange County Sheriff's Office said the incident began after Rivera accused her mother's boyfriend of having sex with her daughter. Witnesses told officers that the girl had denied having sex with him, the affidavit said.

According to officials, Rivera said she killed her daughter to prevent her from having sexual relations with men. She said she believed her daughter was having sex with men because she ""smiled different,"" according to the affidavit.

Orange County Sheriff John Mina said there appeared to be no validity to Rivera's claim that her daughter was sexually active.

1102,"Scooters at Disney parks spawn accidents, lawsuits, glares","ORLANDO, Fla. — Early at the Magic Kingdom entrance, it's another day of fun about to begin as ""Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirate's Life For Me!"" blasts on the speakers and the first electric scooters are lined up to go.

But by the time the park officially opens at 9 a.m., half of the scooters available for the day are already rented to anyone at least 18 willing to pay $50 a day. Other park-goers roll in through the turnstiles on motorized scooters they've rented outside the parks or own themselves.

""Will the scooters run out?"" asks a woman who looks worried. They are usually gone by 11 a.m., a Disney employee tells her with an apologetic smile.

Scooters are as visible at Disney parks as Mickey Mouse ears and turkey legs, and they provide a lifeline for people, some with hidden disabilities, who can't walk the massive grounds. But amid rapidly growing Disney crowds, the vehicles have brought on a rise of civil lawsuits filed by people complaining about being run over or drivers saying they were injured in accidents.

Disney recently banned oversized strollers, but when it comes to scooters, the theme park is limited how it can regulate them because of federal law governing rights for people with disabilities.

Scooters receive the same protections under the law as wheelchairs, said Kenneth Shiotani, a senior staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network. That means Disney — or any other business — can't ban them outright, although theme parks could potentially add rules like a speed limit or forbid them on a particularly narrow path, if there's real, documented danger, Shiotani said.

He added any such rule would likely require the U.S. Department of Justice's approval.

""People need to realize 'disability' is broadly defined,"" Shiotani said, adding that anyone who can walk only a few steps or even a few blocks is protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

""People are using (scooters) because they need them,"" he said about the parks, like Epcot, which is big enough to host a 5K around it.

Disney rents them, and outside companies cater to tourists by dropping rentable ones at their hotels. The devices, which have three and four wheels, typically travel a few miles per hour.

""We expect guests to operate (scooters) with safety and courtesy in mind by being responsible and respectful of other guests while enjoying our parks,"" said Disney spokeswoman Erica Ettori.

The scooters' popularity comes as baby boomers — Americans born between 1946 and 1964 — are aging fast and enduring health problems that can come with being older. By 2029, more than 20 percent of the total U.S. population will be over the age of 65, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

It's a generation that has ""been raised going to the Disney theme parks. They're not going to give it up,"" said theme park blogger and historian Jim Hill. ""They are the ones who are renting these things because they don't want to slow down.""

The Mouse goes to court

In 2018, at least 11 lawsuits were filed that allege injuries caused by scooters at Disney, the most in the past five years, according to an Orlando Sentinel analysis of Orange Circuit litigation. Typically, there were about two to three lawsuits filed every year from 2014 to 2017.

So far in 2019, at least four lawsuits mentioning Disney scooters have already been filed in Orange County.

Disney declined to comment but said the number of lawsuits is small compared with the millions of people who visit the theme parks every year.

Zachery Corn, a tourist from Tennessee, says he was clipped by a scooter from behind while at Epcot's Food and Wine Festival in 2017, according to one of the suits filed in 2018 and scheduled for trial in March 2020.

""He never saw the guy coming,"" said his attorney, David Heil, who has noticed more calls coming into his law firm dealing with scooters since around mid-2017 and into 2018.

Other times, scooter drivers are the ones suing.

Eugene Teto, 62, said he felt like he was driving his scooter blind as he went backwards down the ramp to get off the Monorail. Still, he was following proper Disney protocol as theme park workers directed him, the Connecticut man said in court documents. The lawsuit called the policy ""harebrained.""

""Eugene felt his (scooter) begin to tip backwards, then -suddenly- it flipped violently backwards, slamming Eugene's head onto the concrete platform and twisting his neck in a way that nature never intended,"" said the lawsuit he filed in 2018 after his surgery to repair his spine.

Susan Purcell, who has asthma, sat on her scooter she'd brought from home while on a Disney bus. The bus driver hit the accelerator at a yellow light and made a sharp turn, which tipped over her scooter and slammed her onto the bus floor, her lawsuit says.

""As soon as the driver brought the bus to a stop, passengers jumped up to try to assist Mrs. Purcell,"" according to the lawsuit filed in March. ""But Mrs. Purcell was stuck in the seat of her (scooter), and no one could free her or lift the (scooter) upright. Mrs. Purcell lay on the floor of the bus, helpless and stuck, until fire rescue finally arrived.""

The other major theme parks aren't immune to similar litigation, either.

SeaWorld Orlando was sued last month by an Oviedo mother who says her son was run over by a scooter while walking in the park last year.

However, neither Universal or SeaWorld appears to have faced growing litigation like Disney had in 2018.

Out of the new lawsuits filed in 2018 and 2019, the majority are still pending, including Teto's and Purcell's. But not all.

One woman who sued last year after she said she was run over by a scooter at Hollywood Studios voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit in December. The woman and Disney were required to pay their own attorney fees, according to court documents.

Other cases have ended in settlements over the years, including a man who settled with Disney in October after he said he broke his femur when a scooter crashed into him and pinned him against the large stones inside the Splash Mountain queue in 2013. Settlement amounts are not disclosed in court documents.

The cases have mounted as Disney's attendance keeps rising and likely isn't going to drop off anytime soon with Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge opening this year and Walt Disney World's 50th celebration approaching in 2021.

After Pandora opened at Animal Kingdom in May 2017, attendance at the park jumped nearly 15 percent to an estimated 12.5 million that year. Nearly 20.5 million people walked through Magic Kingdom in 2017, too, according to the latest estimates available from a Themed Entertainment Association/AECOM report.

How trouble starts

What annoys Craig Belke is the Disney darters who jump in front of him as he carefully edges his scooter along, trying to keep a gap between himself and the person ahead of him.

Then the insult worsens. The person who cut him off turns around and lectures him about being more careful.

""It's like, are you kidding me? She ran in front of me, and then she's yelling at me?"" Belke said.

Run-ins with scooters often happen because pedestrians are in full vacation mode and sucked into the bustling atmosphere of a theme park. They just aren't paying attention, Belke said.

He calls himself a good driver, although he's witnessed some not-so-good ones, too.

""Some people have no idea what they're doing with the scooters,"" Belke said.

One New York woman said ""two very young children"" were at the wheel of a scooter that ran over her foot at the Magic Kingdom, according to a 2016 lawsuit that was later voluntarily dismissed in August 2017.

For Belke, his scooter is a godsend.

He used to be ""in terrible agony"" from his back pain by the third day of his family Disney vacation.

Belke, 64, has worked physical jobs for decades on a volunteer fire department and with machinery at a school district in New Jersey.

He hated the idea of using a wheelchair, forcing his wife to push him around, making him feel helpless.

He gave in. He rented a scooter. That was three years ago. Now, he won't go to a theme park without one.

""It turned out to be one of the best trips I've ever had. I wasn't in pain anymore,"" Belke said.

Judgment zone

Amanda Koolis noticed the dirty looks when she visited Disneyland in February.

""I can't tell you how many glares I get,"" said Koolis, 31, a freelancer who has moved regularly with her military husband but calls Destin in the Florida Panhandle her home right now.

But the people judging her don't know she has multiple sclerosis. The autoimmune disease is making her body essentially attacking itself, causing sharp shooting pains and even partial paralysis.

Just like anything in life, there are people who may abuse the system and rent scooters simply because they don't feel like walking around, Koolis admits.

On the other hand, what about others like her? Her disability isn't visible to the outside world and without scooters, the theme parks would be off limits.

Koolis feels the Disney magic of being in a fantasy world, away from the stress of her health problems even if it's just for a few hours.

""Having access to something like Disney is huge,"" Koolis said.

A never-ending battle

How can scooters exist more harmoniously amid the growing crowds at Disney?

Attorney David Heil argues scooter drivers need more instruction before they are ""turned loose"" at the wheel in the parks.

A Disney spokeswoman said park employees give instructions to scooter drivers, and the four outside scooter vendors that work closely with Disney provide written instructions for drivers.

Hill, the Disney historian, dismisses the idea of scooter lanes, saying it would open up Disney to bad publicity and more lawsuits over separate but equal access.

Already, Hill said Disney is taking steps to alleviate the situation to free up space.

At Epcot, Disney plans to relocate the tiles of guests' faces that are posted on granite monoliths, which will widen the paths at the front of the park, Hill said.

Disney also spreads out attendance throughout the year by charging more for the busiest days during holidays and school breaks, a company spokeswoman said about the company's attempts to ease congestion.

Still, the situation has no easy answers, said George Pugliese, 56, a Disney devotee from Kissimmee who bought a scooter after having surgery on both knees. He said he felt trapped one night after the fireworks and had to pull his scooter to the side and wait for the crowds to thin.

People like him will always need scooters. Others will always complain about them — until the day they become unable to walk and need to rent one themselves, he said.

""It's going to be a never-ending battle,"" Pugliese said. ""There is no solution.""",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190428/scooters-at-disney-parks-spawn-accidents-lawsuits-glares?rssfeed=true,2019-04-28T08:32:34Z,Sarasota Herald,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA",FL,34236

Editor's note: For a Twitter feed from court earlier today, scroll down

WEST PALM BEACH — There's been no decision yet on whether to suppress video in New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft’s alleged illicit sex case after a day-long hearing Friday.

Instead, prosecutors and defense attorneys will be back Tuesday to continue the matter in front of County Judge Leonard Hanser into the case at Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter. Videos from the investigation also will be discussed in a Monday hearing for two women arrested in the case.

The bulk of Friday was spent with Kraft attorney Alex Spiro questioning Jupiter police Detective Andrew Sharp about a variety of aspects of the investigation, including a detailed probe into surveillance techniques and investigative processes and methods Sharp and Jupiter police used in the case.

Spiro also spent considerable time pointing out similarities between Sharp’s warrant and one used by Martin County sheriff’s investigators, who searched four spas in their jurisdiction and made dozens of arrests.

Spiro questioned Sharp for about five hours, and the investigator did not seem to be ruffled by it.

During the investigation, covert surveillance cameras were placed in the spa, which allegedly captured illicit sex acts performed by masseuses on male customers.

Spiro asked Sharp for the basis on which he sought the warrant.

“To obtain evidence for an offense … which includes deriving support from the proceeds of prostitution,” Sharp said.

Asked what was the legal basis for asking for this warrant in this type of case, Sharp said: “It’s a felony offense that I was advised that I had probable cause to believe that deriving support from proceeds of prostitution was occurring inside and the only way for me to gather said evidence would be to get"" a 'sneak and peek' warrant.

The videos of Kraft allegedly getting the sex services, which are the subject of a protective order, are expected to be viewed by Hanser in private.

'Touchdown Jesus'

Sharp said he attends Martin County intelligence meetings on Wednesdays.

“During those meetings, it was brought to my attention that they were working an investigation and they believed that there was ties in their investigation to our investigation in Palm Beach County,” he said.

Sharp said mostly men were seen coming from Orchids of Asia, situated in a plaza near U.S. 1 and Indiantown Road.

“There was one evening in question where a group of approximately eight males got off of a golf cart, walked into the establishment, came back outside … did sort of a … touchdown Jesus .. and then walked back inside,” Sharp said.

“At that point I understood that this was not just a regular massage parlor but one that was an illicit massage business.”

Spiro asked Sharp whether he’d been inside and he said he had.

“It’s a nice, clean place, right?” Spiro said.

“I don’t know about clean,’’ Sharp replied.

Spiro also asked Sharp about whether other investigative methods were used instead of getting the 'sneak and peek' warrant.

Background

The hearing before Hanser comes after a number of legal filings in which Kraft’s attorneys have attacked the legality of a “sneak and peek” warrant obtained by Jupiter police in allowing investigators to install covert security cameras.

The case involving Orchids of Asia began being disclosed Feb. 19 at a media briefing at the Martin County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff William Snyder said his agency targeted four spas in Martin County and spoke of the cases in the context of human trafficking.

Investigators were led to Orchids of Asia in the neighboring Palm Beach County community of Jupiter, where covert surveillance cameras were installed after investigators got a warrant.

Kraft's alleged involvement in the case was disclosed days later. Kraft, 77, is accused of getting sex services on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20.

Protection order

Hanser on April 23 entered an order stating the videos should be protected until juries have been sworn in; the case is resolved by plea; the charges are dropped; or at any other time the court determines their release wouldn’t harm Kraft’s right to a fair trial.

In court April 12, Assistant State Attorney Greg Kridos said at the outset of the investigation into Orchids of Asia, there appeared to be human trafficking involved but as the case went on, and after evaluating the evidence, there didn’t appear to be human trafficking.

Kraft’s lawyers have argued the video recordings are ""fruits of an unlawful"" search warrant. They also said law enforcement “defied established Fourth Amendment limits on video surveillance.”

Kraft’s lawyers have said a Jupiter police detective “tapped” a Florida Department of Health investigator on Nov. 14 to go in the spa “specifically to further the criminal investigation.”

They also said an affidavit from the detective was “calculated to mislead (a judge) into believing that the alleged low-level prostitution at the spa was actually part of a much more serious and widespread crime: human trafficking.”

They argued in filings law enforcement officials didn’t exhaust more minimally invasive methods of investigation, saying they did no undercover work and didn’t try to talk to spa employees or former employees.

Further, they have said the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and state law set “limits on how far law enforcement can go and under what circumstances.”

“Those limits were flouted in this case,” a filing said.

In a motion to strike down the suppression motion, prosecutors said Kraft’s lawyers didn’t address the crime of deriving support from the proceeds of prostitution. They said that is the only crime a judge relied on.

They also criticized Kraft’s lawyers’ arguments about rights to privacy, citing case law involving where people can and cannot have expectations of privacy.

They argued because Kraft was in a business and his purpose “was to conduct a business transaction,” he has no valid claim to an expectation of privacy. Even less so, they argue, because he was there “to conduct criminal business transactions.”

1105,Rowdy Reptiles: Woman takes helm of Gator fan group,"Kathleen Klimek, 20, is the first female president of the Rowdy Reptiles, the student group that aims to help the UF men's basketball team win.

The Rowdy Reptiles are a force to be reckoned with in the world of college basketball. And for the first time since its creation in 2011, the University of Florida student organization will be led by a woman.

Kathleen Klimek, 20, is finishing up her second year at UF as an international studies major. Originally from New Jersey, she chose UF for the SEC football experience.

But when she and some friends saw a meeting for the Rowdy Reptiles advertised during her first semester, they decided to check it out. Klimek said she found it hilarious that the Rowdies dug up dirt on the opposing team’s players, so she and her friends started attending the games.

The so-called “dirt sheets” are distributed to the student section before the opposing team warms up. They include anything the executive board can find out about the players online that can be used to get in their heads.

The Rowdies have taunted opponents about everything from their height to their hair.

They chanted “Bloomin’ Onion” every time South Carolina’s Hassani Gravett was at the free throw line because his hair resembled the Outback Steakhouse appetizer.

At another game, they taunted a particularly thin-legged player, calling him “Chicken Legs.”

Once, a female Rowdy Reptile purposely matched with Ole Miss guard Breein Tyree on the dating app Tinder, printed out their messages and distributed them to the entire student section to read out loud at the game.

Aside from the insults, these dedicated fans stand for the entire game, being as loud as possible when the opposing team has the ball and not letting anyone forget when they make a mistake. Some lucky students get the chance to hold up giant cardboard cutouts of the Gator team’s heads — including one of Coach Mike White.

The Rowdies have also been known to trick a team or two into shooting the ball early, when there is still time on the shot clock, giving the Gators an edge.

“After I went to the first few games, I was just hooked,” said Klimek. “I couldn’t get enough of it.”

Klimek went to every home game she could and even traveled to watch the Gators play an away game at Tennessee. During this trip, she got to meet some of the Rowdy Reptiles’ founding members.

Hearing how much they missed their time as Rowdies left Klimek feeling like she needed to take advantage of every moment as a Rowdy while she still could. But running for president didn’t cross her mind until later, when she learned that the then-president was graduating.

After catching herself becoming more devoted to the team, even traveling to the Bahamas to watch the Battle for Atlantis tournament over Thanksgiving break, Klimek thought, “You know what? Why not?”

She said there is nothing on campus that she loves more than the Rowdies, so if she were to have any leadership position, she wanted it to be this one.

On April 10, the Rowdy Reptiles held their final meeting of the year to elect new executive board members. As a way to thank the Rowdies, Coach Mike White invited them to tour the men’s basketball practice facility and shoot hoops before the meeting, according to assistant athletics director, Alicia Longworth.

They ate free tacos while White walked around the room and thanked each Rowdy for their support.

“They’re always early, they’re always loud, and they continue to have more fun than any other student section in the country,” said Longworth.

But Longworth said the Rowdies are just as valuable off the court as well. She said people often forget that players are just 18- to 22-year-olds trying to navigate life on a college campus.

“I think having that support system and having people that end up becoming their friends is actually a really good thing for the team and the program,” she said.

Klimek said she feels honored by her new leadership role, but also feels a little pressure being the club’s first female president.

“My biggest fear is that I won’t be taken seriously,” she said. “But I know my stats. I know my stuff – sportswise and as a professional.”

More than half of the new executive board are women, according to Klimek, and there is no shortage of passionate female Rowdies.

She said that she believes she was elected for her dedication to and passion for the group, traits which qualified all of the previous presidents — who just happened to be men.

Klimek said that her focus for next season will be on boosting attendance at both games and meetings. She also hopes to create a stronger bond among members.

“It’s really hard to feel like you can make an impact at a school this big — of 50,000 people,” she said. “But when you go to those games, Mike White has said it, the players have said it, and I’ll say it: You make an impact on that team. And it’s the most fun you’ll have in your time here as a Gator, I believe.”",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190426/rowdy-reptiles-woman-takes-helm-of-gator-fan-group?rssfeed=true,2019-04-26T13:34:14Z,Gainesville Sun,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608
1106,"Florida bills on human trafficking stir hope, fear as efforts to regulate industry stir controversy","In 2012 billboards like this from Shared Hope International started going up across the country to raise awareness about the problem of child sex trafficking. (AP Photo/Shared Hope International) (Photo: AP)

Savannah Parvu remembers her parents’ warning not to talk about what went on at home, or she would be taken to a bad place — as though accompanying her mother to score drugs was a good place for an 11-year-old to be.

“My mother’s dealer offered her a $10 dollar piece of crack for me,” said the Central Florida native who went to school by day and serviced johns by night.

“He sold me at a Days Inn,” Parvu said. “Sometimes it was three or four men, sometimes 10. That’s why this bill is so important to me.”

“He sold me at a Days Inn. Sometimes it was three or four men, sometimes 10.” Savannah Parvu, sex trafficking viictim

The bill she worked on with state Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen, R-Fort Myers, is one of several this session taking aim at an activity as old as time: the enslavement of people for labor or sex.

But while the political will is there to do something about it, Parvu has had to adjust her sights lower as efforts to regulate, or even define, trafficking stir controversy.

And the full story: Florida human trafficking ring, prostitution in massage parlors

Holding hotels accountable

Fitzenhagen's bill originally funded a support organization for trafficking victims and mandated training for workers in law enforcement, health care and massage parlors and hotels.

But the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association has made immunity from prosecution a bargaining chip for its participation.

“They want something in the bill saying as long as their staff is trained, even if the staff knew or assisted in trafficking, they would be immune,” Parvu said.

Hotel industry jitters about liability killed last year’s efforts, too.

Column: When human trafficking victims live right under our noses, how can we stop it?

“We were working on human trafficking until the last night, the last hour, and it failed,""

Fitzenhagen said.

The reason was a cause of action that would have allowed survivors to sue hotels if they knowingly turned a blind eye,

More: Florida human trafficking ring had ties to New York, China: It started at massage parlor

Now that part’s gone, but Fitzenhagen and her Senate counterpart Lauren Book, D-Plantation, still have to negotiate whether or not to trade off victims’ rights for the industry's participation. And they have less than a week -- the legislative session ends May 3.

Conservatively, hotels are the venue for 20 percent of sex trafficking cases in Southwest Florida, according to the Human Trafficking Data Project.

But anecdotally, “Motels are huge,"" said Ramona Miller, an outreach worker on the streets of Lee County. “If human trafficking was to discontinue, in the area where I work, those people (motel owners) would be out of business.”

“I believe human trafficking is still undefined in so many ways,”” Ramona Miller, A Voice In The Wilderness

That’s because Miller sees trafficking not only in organized rings, but also in a pimp’s use of drugs or emotional manipulation to exploit a few sex workers.



“I believe human trafficking is still undefined in so many ways,” Miller said. “Because it is so broad and so hidden, you have two kinds of data: from those hitting the ground, and from hearsay, after the fact.”

While resisting legislation, the industry is taking voluntary steps to combat trafficking:

""We have a moral obligation to do all we can to prevent this atrocious crime,"" the Florida association wrote as a preface to its new, free online awareness course.

Marriott International recently announced 500,000 of its staff have taken human trafficking awareness training.

“It’s a little hard to tell if someone is forced, said Shailendra Patel, owner of Fort Myers' Golfview Motell, who took the online course offered by the Asian American Hotel Owners Association. ""We’re just trying to learn.”

Naming names

Legislators must also resolve their differences over what’s informally being called the ‘john’s registry': a database of people found guilty of “soliciting, inducing, enticing, or procuring” another to commit “prostitution, lewdness, or assignation.”

The loose definition has sex workers alarmed they’ll be caught in the net, but that’s not why Fitzenhagen struck it from her version. She wants to make sure the registry doesn’t violate a right to privacy.

“I think it’s a disgrace that sex workers are coming before the House and Senate, saying you are going to make me scared of the police, reduce my income and hurt my family if I get arrested,” she said. Well, guess what, prostitution is illegal.”

“Guess what, prostitution is illegal.” State Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen

Not so fast, say others like Jennifer Murphy, a Fort Myers counselor whose clients are sex crime victims.

“If people are just talking about sex trafficking, that is not the entire conversation,"" Murphy said. ""No one grows up healthy and says, 'I'm going to sell my body.' The problem is rampant sexual abuse.”

Instead of a ‘name and shame’ approach, the therapist, who also produces training programs, would like to see education aimed at reducing the demand for commercial sex, including pornography, and empowering people to recognize and avoid abusers.

Four men who recently moved to Lehigh Acres have been arrested after an eight-month investigation into human trafficking involving teen victims. One other man and a woman were also arrested as part of the investigation which also involved the Lee County and Marion County sheriff's offices and the St. Petersburg Police Department.

Can we talk?

As a junior high student Christy Ivie wanted someone to ask the question that would allow her to spill the secret of her father’s sexual abuse.

“I knew my teachers knew,” said the founder of Christy’s Cause dedicated to helping victims of child trafficking. “I was begging internally for someone to say something, but no one did.”

Christy Ivie is the founder and president of Christy’s Cause, a non-profit organization working to eradicate child sex trafficking. (Photo: Jack Hardman/The News-Press, Jack Hardman/The News-Press)

That’s why she supports a bill that would teach trafficking awareness in public schools. Although she was never trafficked, Ivie sees abuse and trafficking as cousins.

“Statistics show trafficking victims are vulnerable because they’ve been abused as children,"" she said; and ""less than one percent are ever identified in part because no one’s talking.

In Ivie’s case, she said her father alternately beat her to enforce secrecy and assured her that father-daughter sex was normal.

The bill would help Florida students avoid dating violence and abuse and understand what makes a healthy relationship, as well as recognize signs of human trafficking.

Protection or victim blaming?

A minimum penalty bill for sex traffickers raised a concern by Brent Woody, the lead attorney for the Justice Restoration Center, that victims could be traumatized in the sentencing process, which relies on proving they weren’t acting voluntarily.

""I have sat through numerous human trafficking cases where a trafficker's defense attorney dragged a survivor through the dirt, called her a ‘whore,"" Woody wrote in an email. “It’s an awful and traumatizing experience that the State could, as far as we know, compel a victim to go through.

Ultimately, the questions of who is a victim and who a criminal will have to be defined in order to be legislated and funded.

For some like Miller and Murphy, who work in the trenches, the definitions are too simplistic and likely to create winners and losers.

“Human trafficking is a buzz word with funding attached to it.” Ramona Miller, A Voice In The Wilderness

""Human trafficking is a buzz word with funding attached to it,"" Miller said.

In the rush to count numbers of victims in order to qualify for grant funds, she urges caution when vetting survivor stories to make sure they can recount a clear narrative of events.

For other Tallahassee watchers, something is better than nothing.

Speaking of the Fitzenhagen bill, which dropped the training requirement for hotels, ""It's not what I want,"" Parvu said, ""but it's better than losing the whole bill.""

1107,Man behind costume in bunny brawl shows up to court in Tampa,"TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - Easter Sunday in Orlando and the Easter bunny wasn't having it when he said he witnessed a man fighting with a woman.

So, he stepped in.

On Thursday, when Antoine McDonald stepped out of court, he came right up to our camera and spoke one-on-one with News Channel 8's Corey Davis.

""Soon as I was forced to take off that mask, you guys realized I was an African American, you said 'oh no, this guy can't be coming on,' so we're going to find a way to shut that down ASAP,"" he said.

McDonald claims his race has somethign to do with people latching on to the story of the bunny brawl and his criminal record, which is unrelated to the fight.

News Channel 8 learned he was in Hillsborough County Court to face charges of possessing a fake driver's license and failing to return a rental car

""I had a fake ID, which has nothing to do with the bunny, which has nothing to do with me helping somebody,"" McDonald said.

He missed the court hearing where Judge Mark R. Wolfe brought up warrants from New Jersey.

Officials from the South Brunswick, New Jersey, Police Department said he's a suspect in a string of car burglaries.

But, the brawling bunny denies any past wrongdoing.

""There's no prior record, none whatsoever,"" he told Davis near the courthouse.

Since McDonald missed the hearing, Wolfe ordered him arrested, but canceled that when he showed up late.",https://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/man-behind-costume-in-bunny-brawl-shows-up-to-court-in-tampa/1953944278,2019-04-25T20:21:45Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

PORT ST. LUCIE — A woman upset because someone wouldn't talk to her ended up in jail, according to police.

Port St. Lucie police responded to a report of a disturbance at a business at 7:05 p.m. Tuesday.

They said they found Sade Frasier, 21, of Southwest Brisbane Street, Port St. Lucie, involved in a domestic dispute that involved her pepper spraying the victim's neck.

Frasier said the reason she used pepper spray was because the victim refused to talk with her, according to police.

1118,92-year-old woman recalls what it was like to become a pilot in the 1960s,"PALM COAST, Fla. - Some people who get anxious on planes take a pill or have a drink to calm their nerves but one local woman decided to face her fear of flying head-on decades ago by becoming a pilot.

It was a move that defied the perception of women at the time.

""My boss said, 'There are two things that don't belong in an airplane, and one is women,'"" Betty Hostler recalled.

The comment was made when she worked part-time at Fixed Base Operators at Boca Raton's airport. It was the early 1960s and there were few women flying planes.

""We were all in dresses and skirts; there wasn't a pair of slacks to be seen,"" 92-year-old Hostler said.

Nothing was going to stop her or the women in The Ninety-Nines, Inc., an organization of female pilots, of which Hostler is a member.

""We were so happy and we all stuck together and we didn't care what they said, we just plowed ahead,"" Hostler said.

But the great-grandmother didn't always love flying.

""I was terrified of airliners. I wouldn't set foot in one,"" Hostler said.

That all changed in 1959, when in her 30s, she took aviation classes. Her best friend had moved a thousand miles away -- so Hostler figured she could fly herself to visit.

""It just seemed like a good idea at the time. The idea just came to me. I knew absolutely nothing,"" Hostler said.

Her family didn't support the decision.

""They thought it was the dumbest thing they ever heard of. I persevered. I really wanted to do this,"" Hostler said.

Soon after learning how to fly, she bought her first single-engine plane for $700.

""My first one was what we call a tail dragger with a tail wheel in the back. They were very difficult to land,"" Hostler said.

Her determination led to some of the best years of her life.

""It was the most freedom I have ever experienced. I was just mad about it. The most wonderful experience is meeting the best friends and going to places that I would never have seen,"" Hostler said.

Those places included Canada, Nicaragua and Mexico. In the 1990s, Hostler was an official with the Angel Derby, a competition where women had to start or stop in a foreign country.

Although Hostler didn't make aviation her career, she encourages the girls and women from today's generation to consider it as a career path.

""If they need anything, I would say see the Ninety-Nines; there is financial help and scholarships being offered from us all the time. It's absolutely wonderful, and I wouldn't know all the people I know, I wouldn't have been to any of the places I've been to if it weren't for my own little airplane. There are so many girls now, and if there are any that want a career, they couldn't have a better (one),"" Hostler said.

Horvath was heading east on the grass median of the highway and attempted to cross the road to get to the east sidewalk of U.S. 90.

The woman failed to notice Horvath, who was wearing dark-colored clothing, and struck him, according to FHP.

Neither the woman nor her 35-year-old passenger were injured in the crash.

No citations have been issued, pending the investigation, according to FHP.

THIS IS A WMUR 2020 SPECIAL, CONVERSATION WITH THE CANDIDATES. TONIGHT CONGRESSMAN SETH MOULTON . >> WELCOME TO OUR CONVERSATION WITH THE CANDIDATES SERIES. OUR GUEST IS SETH MOULTON OF MASSACHUSETTS. TONIGHT WE WILL GET TO KNOW HIM AND WHERE HE STANDS ON KEY ISSUES. I WILL ASK THE CANDIDATES QUESTIONS, THEN AFTER THE BREAK WE WILL HAVE THE STUDIO AUDIENCE ASK THEIR QUESTIONS IN A TOWN HALL FORMAT. FIRST WOULD LOOK INTO THE CANDIDATE’S BIOGRAPHY. SETH MOULTON WAS BORN IN SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS IN 1978. HE GRADUATED FROM PHILLIPS ACADEMY IN ANDOVER BEFORE GETTING A BACHELORS FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY. JUST MONTHS BEFORE THE 9/11 ATTACKS, MOULTON JOINED THE MARINES. HE WAS AMONG THE FIRST AMERICANS TO REACH BAGHDAD IN 2003. HE SERVED FOUR TOURS, AND WAS AWARDED THE BRONZE STAR FOR HIS ACTIONS IN BATTLE. WHEN HE CAME HOME HE GOT AN MBA AN MASTERS IN PUBLIC POLICY AT HARVARD. HE RETURNED TO MASSACHUSETTS, WHERE HE RAN FOR AND WON A SEAT IN CONGRESS AND 2016, REELECTED IN 2016 AND 2018. SETH MOULTON SITS ON THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE AND TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE. HE IS MARRIED, HAS A DAUGHTER, AND LIVES IN SALEM, MASS. ADAM: THANKS FOR JOINING US. IT IS A FIELD OF NEARLY 20. WHAT SETS YOU APART FROM THE PACK? REP. MOULTON: FIRST OF ALL, MY BACKGROUND IS DIFFERENT. MY EXPERIENCE LEADING AMERICANS IN SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES ON HER, AND BRINGING THEM TO A COMMON MISSION, THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP IS WHAT WE NEED IN A DIVISIVE TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE SECOND THING IS I AM TALKING ABOUT ISSUES DEMOCRATS DON’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT, BUT WHERE WE HAVE TO CONFRONT DONALD TRUMP -- NATIONAL SECURITY, WHAT IT MEANS TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY STRONG AND SAFE, AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A PATRIOT. FOR TOO LONG THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS SEATED THESE ISSUES -- CEDED THESE ISSUES TO REPUBLICANS, BUT THIS IS WHERE DONALD TRUMP WAS WEAKEST. ADAM: ISIS IS A COMMON RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN ATTACK IN SRI LANKA THAT KILLED MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE. WE HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, BUT DO YOU BELIEVE WE HAVE TAKEN OUR EYE OFF THE BALL WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM? REP. MOULTON: WE HAVE ABANDONED OUR ALLIES AROUND THE GLOBE. YOU STOP INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM BY HAVING COORDINATED INTELLIGENCE AMONG YOUR ALLIES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DISPARAGED OUR ALLIES LEFT AND RIGHT. HE DISPARAGED THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER, NATO, THE ALLIANCE FEELS LIKE IT IS FALLING APART. WE SHOULD BE STRENGTHENING THOSE ALLIANCES. I CALLED FOR A PACIFIC NATO. WE STAND WITH OUR ALLIES, WE MAKE OUR COUNTRIES STRONGER AND SAFER TOGETHER. IT ALSO MEANS WE STAND UP TO OUR ENEMIES. IT DOES NOT MEAN COZYING UP TO PUTIN, TO KIM JONG-UN LIKE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN DOING, IT MEANS CONFRONTING THEM AND LEAVING WITH MORAL AUTHORITY, THE WAY WE USED TO IN AMERICA. ADAM: YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF THE WAR IN IRAQ AS AN IRAQ WAR VETERAN. WHAT WOULD THE THRESHOLD BE FOR GOING TO WAR? REP. MOULTON: WE ONLY GO TO WAR IF IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. THE MOST SOLEMN DUTY CONGRESS HAS IS TO DECIDE WHEN TO PUT YOUNG AMERICAN LIVES ON THE LINE. CONGRESS HAS ABROGATED THIS ROLE IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, BECAUSE WE ARE STILL OPERATING UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION FOR THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE THAT WAS PASSED AFTER 9/11. THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT IS SENT TO CONGRESS, WE ARE GOING TO RESCIND THAT AUTHORITY AND PASS A NEW ONE SO THAT WE HAVE A TRANSPARENT DEBATE BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO JUSTIFY WHY WE ARE PUTTING MEN AND WOMEN IN HARM’S WAY. ADAM: DO YOU THINK IS CONGRESS IS GIVEN THE POWER, THAT THEY WOULD EXERCISE IT RESPONSIBLY? REP. MOULTON: IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF CONGRESS TO EXERCISE THAT AUTHORITY. IT IS THE LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT TO WORK WITH CONGRESS TO GET DONE WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO KEEP OUR NATION SAFE. ADAM: YOU TALK ABOUT PUTTING LIVES AT RISK. DO YOU BELIEVE YOUNG WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO SIGN UP FOR THE DRAFT WHEN THEY TURN 18? REP. MOULTON: I DO. THAT IS A HARD VOTE WE TOOK ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WOMEN ARE SERVING BRAVELY AND HONORABLY IN OUR ARMED SERVICES TODAY. I DID TWO TOURS IN IRAQ. THE SECOND OF TOURS, WE DID A VARIETY OF SMALL PROJECTS FOR GENERAL PETRAEUS. MY FIRST OFFICER WAS A WOMAN. WE WERE MORE COMBAT EFFECTIVE BECAUSE SHE WAS A PART OF THE TEAM. SHE ENABLED US TO TALK TO HAVE OF THE IRAQI -- TO HALF OF THE IRAQI POPULATION WE WOULDN’T HAVE. IRAQI SOCIETY IS A SEXIST SOCIETY, MEN TALK TO MEN AND WOMEN TALK TO WOMEN. WE COULDN’T HAVE TALKED TO WOMEN IF SHE WAS NOT ON OUR TEAM. I KNOW A LOT OF WOMEN WHO FEEL THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING PART OF THE DRAFT AS WELL. ADAM: YOUTH IS A THEME IN THIS CAMPAIGN. YOU ARE ON THE YOUNGER END OF CANDIDATES. WOULD IT BE WRONG FOR DEMOCRATS TO NOMINATE AN OLDER CANDIDATE? REP. MOULTON: WE HAVE TO NOMINATE THE BEST PERSON TO TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP. I THINK IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITY BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A RECKLESS MAJOR IN CHIEF. -DONALD TRUMP IN THE OVAL OFFICE IS A DANGER EVERY DAY, NOT JUST THE WAY HE IS TAKING APART OUR DEMOCRACY AT HOME, BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAYS HE IS PUTTING US IN DANGER AROUND THE GLOBE. THE FACT THAT HE’S TWEETING WITH A DICTATOR WITH HIS FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR BUTTON IN NORTH KOREA IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE DANGER HE PUTS US IN AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. WE HAVE TO GET RID OF DONALD TRUMP. THAT MEANS AS DEMOCRATS SELECTING WHO IS BEST POSITIONED. ADAM: CONGRESSMAN MOULTON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/seth-moulton-presidential-campaign-patriotism-service/27288496,2019-04-26T20:08:31Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
1131,Florida's human trafficking bills stir hope and fear,"In 2012 billboards like this from Shared Hope International started going up across the country to raise awareness about the problem of child sex trafficking. (AP Photo/Shared Hope International) (Photo: AP)

Savannah Parvu remembers her parents’ warning not to talk about what went on at home, or she would be taken to a bad place – as though accompanying her mother to score drugs was a good place for an 11-year-old to be.

“My mother’s dealer offered her a $10 dollar piece of crack for me,” said the Central Florida native who went to school by day and serviced johns by night.

“He sold me at a Days Inn. Sometimes it was three or four men, sometimes 10.” Savannah Parvu, sex trafficking viictim

“He sold me at a Days Inn,” Parvu said. “Sometimes it was three or four men, sometimes 10. That’s why this bill is so important to me.”

The bill she worked on with state Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen, R-Fort Myers, is one of several this session taking aim at an activity as old as time: the enslavement of people for labor or sex.

Buy Photo IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THAT THE PHOTO STAYS AS SILHOUETTE. The son of Matilde Andres and Pascual Sebastian plays in his north Fort Myers home. in 2005. His parents are in jail charged with sex trafficking and harboring illegal imigrants. ANDREW WEST/The News-Press..... (Photo: Andrew West, N-P Staff)

But while the political will is there to do something about it, Parvu has had to adjust her sights lower as efforts to regulate, or even define, trafficking stir controversy.

Holding hotels accountable

Fitzenhagen's bill originally funded a support organization for trafficking victims and mandated training for workers in law enforcement, health care and massage parlors and hotels.

But the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association has made immunity from prosecution a bargaining chip for its participation.

“They want something in the bill saying as long as their staff is trained, even if the staff knew or assisted in trafficking, they would be immune,” Parvu said.

“I believe human trafficking is still undefined in so many ways,”” Ramona Miller, A Voice In The Wilderness

Hotel industry jitters about liability killed last year’s efforts, too.

“We were working on human trafficking until the last night, the last hour, and it failed,""

Fitzenhagen said.

The reason was a cause of action that would have allowed survivors to sue hotels if they knowingly turned a blind eye,

Now that part’s gone, but Fitzenhagen and her Senate counterpart Lauren Book, D-Plantation, still have to negotiate whether or not to trade off victims’ rights for the industry's participation. And they have less than a week -- the legislative session ends May 3.

Conservatively, hotels are the venue for 20 percent of sex trafficking cases in Southwest Florida, according to the Human Trafficking Data Project.

But anecdotally, “Motels are huge,"" said Ramona Miller, an outreach worker on the streets of Lee County. “If human trafficking was to discontinue, in the area where I work, those people (motel owners) would be out of business.”

“It’s a little hard to tell if someone is forced.” Shailendra Patel, Golfview Motel owner

That’s because Miller sees trafficking not only in organized rings, but also in a pimp’s use of drugs or emotional manipulation to exploit a few sex workers.



“I believe human trafficking is still undefined in so many ways,” Miller said. “Because it is so broad and so hidden, you have two kinds of data: from those hitting the ground, and from hearsay, after the fact.”

While resisting legislation, the industry is taking voluntary steps to combat trafficking:

""We have a moral obligation to do all we can to prevent this atrocious crime,"" the Florida association wrote as a preface to its new, free online awareness course.

Marriott International recently announced 500,000 of its staff have taken human trafficking awareness training.

“It’s a little hard to tell if someone is forced, said Shailendra Patel, owner of Fort Myers' Golfview Motell, who took the online course offered by the Asian American Hotel Owners Association. ""We’re just trying to learn.”

Naming names

Legislators must also resolve their differences over what’s informally being called the ‘john’s registry': a database of people found guilty of “soliciting, inducing, enticing, or procuring” another to commit “prostitution, lewdness, or assignation.”

“Guess what, prostitution is illegal.” State Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen

The loose definition has sex workers alarmed they’ll be caught in the net, but that’s not why Fitzenhagen struck it from her version. She wants to make sure the registry doesn’t violate a right to privacy.

Four men who recently moved to Lehigh Acres have been arrested after an eight-month investigation into human trafficking involving teen victims. One other man and a woman were also arrested as part of the investigation which also involved the Lee County and Marion County sheriff's offices and the St. Petersburg Police Department. (Photo: Special to The News-Press)

“I think it’s a disgrace that sex workers are coming before the House and Senate, saying you are going to make me scared of the police, reduce my income and hurt my family if I get arrested,” she said. Well, guess what, prostitution is illegal.”

Not so fast, say others like Jennifer Murphy, a Fort Myers counselor whose clients are sex crime victims.

“If people are just talking about sex trafficking, that is not the entire conversation,” Jennfer Murphy, sex abuse counselor

“If people are just talking about sex trafficking, that is not the entire conversation,"" Murphy said. ""No one grows up healthy and says, 'I'm going to sell my body.' The problem is rampant sexual abuse.”

Instead of a ‘name and shame’ approach, the therapist, who also produces training programs, would like to see education aimed at reducing the demand for commercial sex, including pornography, and empowering people to recognize and avoid abusers.

Can we talk?

As a junior high student Christy Ivie wanted someone to ask the question that would allow her to spill the secret of her father’s sexual abuse.

Christy Ivie is the founder of Christy’s Cause. (Photo: Special to The News-Press)

“I knew my teachers knew,” said the founder of Christy’s Cause dedicated to helping victims of child trafficking. “I was begging internally for someone to say something, but no one did.”

That’s why she supports a bill that would teach trafficking awareness in public schools. Although she was never trafficked, Ivie sees abuse and trafficking as cousins.

“Statistics show trafficking victims are vulnerable because they’ve been abused as children,"" she said; and ""less than one percent are ever identified in part because no one’s talking.

In Ivie’s case, she said her father alternately beat her to enforce secrecy and assured her that father-daughter sex was normal.

“I was begging internally for someone to say something, but no one did.” Christy Ivie, Christy's Cause

The bill would help Florida students avoid dating violence and abuse and understand what makes a healthy relationship, as well as recognize signs of human trafficking.

Protection or victim blaming?

A minimum penalty bill for sex traffickers raised a concern by Brent Woody, the lead attorney for the Justice Restoration Center, that victims could be traumatized in the sentencing process, which relies on proving they weren’t acting voluntarily.

""I have sat through numerous human trafficking cases where a trafficker's defense attorney dragged a survivor through the dirt, called her a ‘whore,"" Woody wrote in an email. “It’s an awful and traumatizing experience that the State could, as far as we know, compel a victim to go through.

“Human trafficking is a buzz word with funding attached to it.” Ramona Miller, A Voice In The Wilderness

Ultimately, the questions of who is a victim and who a criminal will have to be defined in order to be legislated and funded.

Buy Photo Ramona Miller of A Voice in the Wilderness plans to head into the streets to work with her clients including lovers Lucy Tapia and Ana Novicki who ride with her in the back seat. (Photo: Andrew West/The News-Press)

For some like Miller and Murphy, who work in the trenches, the definitions are too simplistic and likely to create winners and losers.

""Human trafficking is a buzz word with funding attached to it,"" Miller said.

In the rush to count numbers of victims in order to qualify for grant funds, she urges caution when vetting survivor stories to make sure they can recount a clear narrative of events.

For other Tallahassee watchers, something is better than nothing.

Speaking of the Fitzenhagen bill, which dropped the training requirement for hotels, ""It's not what I want,"" Parvu said, ""but it's better than losing the whole bill.""

1145,"Miami-Dade officer in rough arrest should face charges, activists say","MIAMI - Two civil rights groups are urging Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle to file criminal charges against a county police officer who was recorded getting into a struggle with a woman after she had reported a crime.

Dyma Loving said a neighbor pulled a gun on her while she was walking in southwest Miami-Dade County in early March. Loving called police for help, but when Officer Alejandro Giraldo arrived, she and Giraldo started to argue. Giraldo eventually grabbed her by the neck, forced Loving to the ground and arrested her. A bystander recorded the incident using a mobile phone.

The Miami-Dade Police Department also released video from Giraldo's body camera. After video of the arrest attracted widespread attention, the department relieved Giraldo of duty, calling the incident ""deeply troubling.""

Loving, 26, was initially charged with disorderly conduct and resisting an officer without violence, but those charges were later dropped. She is pursuing a civil lawsuit against Giraldo.

""She called the police for help, but what we know is that police officers in situations like that are often not the ones who are doing what they were sworn to do -- to serve and protect,"" said Mary Beth Onyeukwu, of the Color of Change group.

The groups collected more than 50,000 signatures calling for Giraldo to be charged and delivered them to Rundle's office in Miami Tuesday. The local chapter of the NAACP has also called for criminal charges.

The activists believe that Giraldo, who is Hispanic, treated Loving differently because she is a black woman.

""Officer Giraldo’s actions were racist. They were in excusable and he cannot be trusted to protect and serve the Miami Dade community,"" said Natalie Green, of Ultraviolet.

1148,Witnesses describe erratic driving by Pensacola woman accused of causing deadly crash,"The Pensacola woman accused of causing a three-vehicle crash on Easter that killed a young father was driving erratically in the moments before the wreck, witnesses told investigators.

The witnesses said Marie Ann Simpkins, 47, was swerving dangerously in her Hyundai Sonata and accelerated before she ultimately ran a red light that caused the crash at about 4:30 p.m. Sunday, according to her arrest report.

Hours after the wreck, investigators said Simpkins was showing ""signs of impairment as a result of drugs,"" the report states. Authorities also allegedly found marijuana in her possession while she was being booked into jail.

Simpkins had a video appearance in court Tuesday in front of First Judicial Circuit Court Judge Jennifer Frydrychowicz.

In accordance with Assistant State Attorney Matt Gordon’s recommendation, the judge charged Simpkins with vehicular homicide, DUI manslaughter, reckless driving causing serious bodily injury, DUI causing serious bodily injury and possession of marijuana.

Frydrychowicz set Simpkins' total bond at $701,000.

Simpkins allegedly ran a red light on Fairfield Drive at its intersection with North W Street and crashed into a Nissan Murano and a Ford Mustang. The Mustang was driven by Randy Riley, 49, and his 22-year-old son, Nelson Riley, was a passenger inside the vehicle.

Nelson Riley was pronounced dead at the scene. As of Tuesday afternoon, Randy Riley remained in critical condition at Baptist Hospital.

The Nissan was driven by Gladys Taylor, 35, who authorities said was also transported to a local hospital with minor injuries.

Simpkins was transported to Baptist Hospital with minor injuries. When investigators interviewed her at 8:26 p.m. at the hospital, she had difficulty speaking clearly and did not know the time, telling investigators she thought it was 4 o'clock, according to her arrest report.

She was arrested and booked into the Escambia County Jail at 10:59 p.m. Sunday after being treated and released from the hospital.

Simpkins' arrest report states two witnesses provided Florida Highway Patrol investigators similar descriptions of her erratic driving leading up to the crash.

One witness said he saw Simpkins’ car swerve back and forth in the outside lane of Fairfield Drive so much that he was afraid to pass her because he feared his own car would be hit, the report stated.

The man also told troopers Simpkins had run one other red light before she ran the light on Fairfield Drive. He added that Simpkins had to accelerate to make it through that light, the report stated.

A second witness told troopers he had observed Simpkins run red lights at Hollywood and Ruby avenues, the report stated.

That witness told authorities that he had been following Simpkins before the fatal crash while he was on the phone with 911 dispatchers about the dangerous driving he was observing, the report stated.

He stated that he also saw Simpkins speed up when approaching the red light at North W Street, the report stated.

1151,Review: Country star Kelsea Ballerini brings 'Miss Me More' tour to sold-out Hertz Arena in Estero,"CLOSE The 25-year-old Knoxville native sang her hits during her ""Miss Me More"" tour stop in Estero. Ashley Collins, ashley.collins@naplesnews.com; 239-213-6029

Country music star Kelsea Ballerini is unapologetically herself, even while performing her first arena-headlining tour at the sold-out Hertz Arena on Thursday night.

Wearing a fiery red outfit with knee-high boots and an equally high ponytail, the 25-year-old Knoxville native commanded attention when she first hit the stage with her girl power anthem ""Miss Me More.""

""I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings

Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you

Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more (I miss me more)""

The hit song also happens to be the name of Ballerini's 14-city tour, which kicked off April 11 in Maryland and features two Florida stops, including St. Augustine.

Coming up at Hertz: ZZ Top to play at Hertz Arena for 50th anniversary tour with Cheap Trick. Tickets on sale this week.

Ballerini was joined by country newcomer Brandon Ratcliff, who performed a 15-minute set, and Brett Young, who had nearly every female concertgoer swooning as he sung his No. 1 single on Billboard's Country Airplay chart, ""Here Tonight.""

Young, who's from California, had the crowd going for nearly an hour with his Cali-country hits, and it seemed as though concertgoers couldn't possibly get more excited until Ballerini took to the stage.

She sang several tracks from her latest album “Unapologetically,” including her cheeky “Get Over Yourself” and her more reflective tracks “Machine Heart” and “Legends.” She also performed songs off her first album ""The First Time,"" including “Dibs,” “Love Me Like You Mean It” and “Peter Pan.” She closed the show with a high-energy performance of “This Feeling,” a mainstream pop song she and The Chainsmokers collaborated on.

Hot off her sophomore album ""Unapologetically,"" to say Ballerini's musical career is on fire is an understatement. She was recently inducted as the newest and youngest current member of the Grand Ole Opry by one of country's leading ladies, Carrie Underwood.

In between songs, Ballerini spoke from the heart, sharing intimate stories behind ""Unapologetically,"" which she said she recorded while she was going through her first real breakup and growing into her own as a woman. She also shared how excited she was to receive the honor from the Grand Ole Opry earlier this month.

""It's the peak of life,"" she told the crowd, then joking that it could only go downhill from here. ""It was the biggest honor of all time.""

Ballerini, now a two-time Grammy nominated artist, moved to Nashville with her mom when she was only 15 to pursue a music career. She dedicated ""In Between,"" a song off her latest album, to her mom, who was in the crowd Thursday night for the three-hour show, along with Ballerini's Australian singer-songwriter hubby Morgan Evans.

But it was the fans Ballerini kept coming back to.

""Thank you for making a 15-year-old girl's wish come true,"" she told concertgoers before stepping off the stage and walking around the arena to take selfies and shake hands with fans while singing her hit song ""Love Me Like You Mean It.""

Ballerini is a force to be reckoned with not just in country radio but the music industry in general. In the past she's opened for some of country's biggest acts like Alan Jackson, Lady Antebellum, Tim McGraw, Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban. Now that she finally has her own tour she can show off how versatile she is as an artist. She can go from country to pop and isn't afraid to cross genres.

And she also isn't afraid to strap on a guitar or play the drums when the occasion arises. She was completely in her element when it was just her and the mic. A couple of times she took a break from skipping around the stage to autograph posters all while still singing.

She's definitely on her way and while there's no telling what Ballerini will do next, one thing is for certain: She won't apologize for being herself.

1152,"TheatreZone dances, sings, smiles its way off season","The cast performs the musical review of Kander and Ebb songs from Cabaret, Chicago and other musicals at G&L Theatre in Naples on Monday, April 22, 2019. (Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Of course you'll walk away from ""And the World Goes 'Round"" at TheatreZone humming your favorite John Kander-Fred Ebb tunes. But the ones you don't know steal the show.

The five singers-dancers-actors do a hilarious diatribe to life on the treadmill with ""Coffee in a Cardboard Cup,"" adding jitters and speed as they gulp and the song flies on. While you may not be singing ""Yes"" on the way home, it's a sunny spirit lift, with a bouyant beat to match its chipper lyrics:

There's lots of chaff, there's lots of wheat

You might get mugged as you walk the streets

But on the other hand you might reach

That handsome stranger you've longed to meet

Both of the above songs are from a long-forgotten musical for which the two wrote music, ""70 Girls 70."" For every ""Chicago"" and Cabaret"" — both works with the Kander and Ebb team behind them — there are another handful of musicals that didn't make it, with some of the team's great music on the shelf with them.

""And the World Goes 'Round,"" the musical revue of their works, dusts them off and splices in some of their outside works for an engaging music marathon.

And there's always room for a tap dance, featuring Kayley Stevens and Charles Logan romping nimbly around stage. (Learn to tap dance, guys; that clicky cavort-athon changes the outcome of Logan's plaintive ""Marry Me"" proposal to Stevens.)

Each of the five in this production was chosen for a special skill; one may sing better, but precision timing and comic touch may be the forte for another. While Broadway veteran Patrick Sullivan may deliver a suitably menacing ""Kiss of the Spider Woman,"" he's fracturing as the toned, tanned, Ray-banned boy toy of ""Arthur in the Afternoon.""

All of them can sell the song, but they have to work to match Carolann Sanitas' vamp of ""How Lucky Can You Get,"" a tune from the long-gone ""Funny Lady"" sequel to ""Funny Girl."" (For the record, the hit ""Funny Girl"" was a Jule Styne-Bob Merrill collaboration, so you won't hear ""People"" here.)

Sanitas and Laura Hodos also ham up ""Class,"" from ""Chicago,"" playing a pair of low-lifes sniffing at others' manners. They reprise as a pair for ""What's So Wonderful,"" a movie star and a housewife wryly comparing lives.

Only Logan can match them in the silly, slightly suggestive cabaret paeon to ""Sara Lee,"" effusing over every product in the freezer:

And it thrills me right to my soul

When I'm chewin' your finger roll

And I'm cryin' ""For goodness sake

There never been a better banana cake""

And he lusts to taste her cherry Danish, too, so we're pretty sure this one didn't show up in TV commercials.

Logan does another comic turn with a ""Chicago"" tune as the sad sack ""Mr. Cellophane,"" a dweeb who can't even get the spotlight to stay on him as he moves.

The evening has its share of poignant moments, such as Sullivan's wistful ""I Don't Remember You"" from a musical titled ""The Happy Time."" He does its title tune as well; Hodos offers a hopeful ""Maybe This Time"" from ""Cabaret"" and Stevens meditates on love as ""A Quiet Thing"" (from ""Flora, the Red Menace"").

Karen Molnar's choreography takes advantage of the G&L Theatre's small stage with circular routines and visuals, such as a black light segment in ""New York, New York""; the troupe dons white top hats, gloves and spats for a visual treat on the darkened stage. She even puts the troupe on roller skates for breathtaking zips around ""The Rink,"" title tune to that musical.

This show employs lighting cleverly, embedding lights in the singers' hats to give their faces a glow for the dark tune ""Money, Money"" (from the movie version of ""Cabaret"").

And the troupe outdoes itself in a jazzed, Manhattan Transfer harmony take on the title tune from ""Cabaret,"" backed by Charles Fornara and a top-flight band whose arrangements — save for a strangely waltzy ""My Coloring Book"" — seal the evening.

It's a happy way for TheatreZone, and audiences, to close the 2018-19 season.

1154,"Man accused killing parents, brother after paying Bulgarian call girl $200K granted $750K bail","0 Man accused killing parents, brother after paying Bulgarian call girl $200K granted $750K bail

SANFORD, Fla. - A 29-year-old man accused of a triple murder could be allowed to leave jail.

Grant Amato is accused of killing his parents and his brother at their home in January after a dispute about him sending $200,000 of the family's money to a Bulargian call girl.

Amato was granted a $750,000 bail Thursday afternoon.

TRENDING NOW:

Jared Shapiro, Amato's defense attorney, said Thursday that although it is unusual for a triple murder suspect to receive bail, his client is entitled to it because he has cooperated with investigators.

""He was unemployed at the time of his arrest, and we're not aware of any significant assets that he has to post bond,"" Shapiro said.

Prosecutors said they had sought a $25 million bail, because Amato is computer savvy, he could create fake travel documents and he faces the death penalty if he is convicted.

""(The call girl) certainly is one incentive for him to leave this country and go to Bulgaria,"" Assistant State Attorney Stewart Stone said.

Defense attorney Jeff Dowdy said he sought a $150,000 bail, because Amato did not flee after the slayings and he has cooperated with investigators.

""There is still no physical forensic evidence linking him to this crime,"" he said.

The judge asked if Amato can afford to pay his bail.

""We're going to explore that,"" Dowdy said. ""We know he does have family resources.""

If Amato is released after paying bail, he will be forbidden from leaving Central Florida and from accessing computers or the internet, and he must wear a GPS-enabled ankle monitor.

1156,Photos give glimpse of life stolen from Joleen Cummings,"YULEE, Fla. - More evidence photos released Thursday in the Kimberly Kessler case give a glimpse into the life of the woman Kessler is accused of killing: 34-year-old Joleen Cummings.

Investigators took photos of Cummings' home as she left it last May when she went to work at Tangles hair salon in Yulee -- never to return.

The haunting images show a house once full of life, with children's toys, books and a small table and chairs. Cummings was supposed to pick up her three children from her ex-husband on Mother's Day last year.

She never showed, and her family reported her missing.

Cummings is now presumed dead, although her body has not been found. Her former co-worker, Kimberly Kessler, is charged with her murder.

PHOTOS: More images released in Joleen Cummings murder case

The images released Thursday of Cummings' home include one of receipt from a fabric store showing that Cummings purchased fabrics and artificial flowers the night before her death.

More evidence of a life unfinished.

In another photo, a sign that says ""Family"" can be seen on a shelf in the living area.

Cummings' mother, Anne Johnson, has attended every court hearing for Kessler since her daughter's disappearance.

At the most recent hearing, Johnson asked for prayers as the anniversary of her daughter's disappearance looms.

""We're coming up on May,"" Johnson said. ""Asking for prayers without ceasing for my daughter's remains to be found. Praying without ceasing for justice to be served.""

Investigators believe Kessler, who was initially arrested on an auto theft charge a few days after Cummings vanished, is the last person to have seen Cummings alive.

Earlier this month, the State Attorney’s Office released hundreds of pages of documents and other evidence that provide a glimpse of what Kessler was doing in the hours before her arrest.

That evidence included surveillance video and evidence photos taken inside Tangles Hair Salon, the Yulee business where the women worked, and items Kessler is accused of buying at Walmart.

Kessler’s attorneys have been fighting to keep certain pieces of evidence under wraps, arguing that their release could taint the potential jury pool and jeopardize their client’s right to a fair trial.

Images released so far showed evidence markers and a discarded shoe in a wooded area behind the salon and an unsettling amount of blood found on the salon’s walls, chairs, cabinet and sink.

There was also blood on a bleach bottle and a mop. A blacklight photo of the mop shows blood that showed up in mop strokes on the floor after crime scene investigators applied the chemical luminol.

Also released was a Walmart receipt for 30-gallon trash bags, an electric knife and a large bottle of ammonia. Investigators said surveillance video showed Kessler using the store’s self-checkout lanes.

In addition, video showed Kessler’s Kia Soul leaving the Walmart. She and the vehicle were also seen at a nearby carwash. Investigators said $1,600 cash was found in her car at the time of her arrest.

Evidence also suggests a confrontation between the two women on May 9, just days before Cummings’ disappearance. A co-worker said Cummings mentioned wanting to look into Kessler’s background.

Cummings’ SUV was located outside a Home Depot after her family reported her missing. Though her body has not been found, investigators said they’ve found several notable items at a Georgia landfill.

The case has attracted national attention in part because it hasn't been solved, but also because authorities said Kessler, who went by Jennifer Sybert, has used 17 different aliases over the years.

The results of a psychiatric evaluation of Kessler are expected to become available soon.

1157,Researchers: CBD could improve memory loss,"BISMARCK, N.D. (KX News) - Alzheimer's is genetic, and one North Dakota woman has had her fill of the disease after watching multiple generations of her family go through it.

She shares her unexpected solution in holding onto, and improving memory.

Pam Kostelecky lost her sister to Alzheimer's in 2016. She has an Aunt suffering from it and has lost an uncle as well.

Now that her mother has developed dementia, she started researching solutions with her own daughter, and they found out, CBD could have the answers they've been looking for.

Pam Kostelecky says she began to experience a decline in her own memory.

She shares, ""I had become really concerned because I was having an issue with words and not being able to find my words, which is what happened to my sister.""

So, she turned to CBD. She said she wasn't really expecting a change when she started.

Kostelecky adds, ""I just felt if I could maintain what I have with memory and brain clarity, which wasn't so 'brain clear', I would be happy as long as I didn't go down that road.""

She says three days later she felt mentally sharper.

Kostelecky explains, ""My vision was sharper. My thoughts were connecting the dots.""

KX News spoke to a physical therapist who says she has been recommending it to her patients.

Dakota Physical Therapy Owner April Bergan shares, ""I have more people asking me than I tell them.""

She explained how our bodies naturally produce some cannabidiol. But she says we're now deficient because it's not in our foods like it used to be.

Bergan explains, ""The cows were eating it, we were consuming more of it, and now we're not. So, we're deprived of it and that's the issue. It's not that we're taking something we've never had before and introducing it. It's actually something we need.""

After finding success for herself, Kostelecky started sharing the wealth with her mom.

She adds, ""She began having conversations with me, and great conversations and funny. And it's like her personality came back too.""

It hasn't been a perfect journey, and her mom was taken off CBD due to other medications.

As for Kostelecky, she says her confidence is back, and she's no longer as worried about losing her train of thought in holding a conversation.

She says, ""We can't say that it cures, treats or mitigates any type of disease. But we do see in personal lives and testimonies of incredible changes.""

Kostelecky says it took a lot of research. Even with hemp-derived CBD being legal now nationwide, under the 2018 Farm Bill, research is in its early stages, and it's important to know what you're getting.

Last month I shared advice from the owner of a Bismarck health store about what to look for when buying CBD products.

Students should pay back loans

I have recently seen in the news that some are calling for forgiveness of all student loans and having others pay for them instead. I am totally against this proposal and all of you should be, too. I went to three years of private college and three years of university, which was out-of-state tuition for me. I worked full time during my first three years of school and part-time the next two years. Thankfully, my wife at the time worked multiple jobs to support our family too.

I then got a good job in Florida and worked my butt off for 10 years to pay back every cent of my student loans.We had to make sacrifices, but we survived. I understand that it is tough for today's graduates but they have to pay the price and do what is necessary to pay back their obligation that they signed up for when they took out student loans.

All I am saying is, if you take out a loan, pay it back with your own sweat and tears. You don't need a BMW and iPhone to survive. Thank you.

Message of MAGA is offensive

In response to Mr. Bradley’s opinion “Here’s why I wear a Make American Great Again cap,"" the message on the hat does offend me.

The first offensive part is the word “again,” which means “another time” or “once more.” To what time do you wish to return? When in recent times wasn’t it great? We always have had serious issues with civil, women’s and LGBTQ rights, as well as immigration concerns; however, our representatives (former and present) continue working on those to make this a great country.

The other part of your hat that offends me is the message. In the Oval Office, Kanye West said the MAGA hat makes him feel like Superman. I think too many people feel Trump has empowered them to do whatever they want. Remember Trump’s comment that he could shoot an individual on a widely trafficked New York City street and not lose one voter?

The message of MAGA is that you are OK with grabbing a woman by her genitals, referring to POWs as not being heroes, the birther movement, racist comments, believing Putin over the U.S. intelligence community, seeing Kim Jong Un as a nice person, having domestic militias patrolling our Southern border and discriminating against those in the transgender community who want to serve in our military.

To me, once you wear that hat there is an implied endorsement of Trump’s policies and remarks.

In our dialogue I would love to see a hat that says Make America Great for All — MAGFA.

Auto-based amendment off-course

Regarding the proposed cell phone usage/driving amendment: It appears the author erred in the writing, stating violations of the new law would constitute a non-moving violation — then includes in the text that if the vehicle operator is stopped (not moving), cell phone use would be permitted. It stands to reason that any abuse of the law would then be a moving violation and should be prosecuted as such

There was no mention of the use of earbuds as an endangerment to public safety while operating a vehicle. These devices prevent the driver from hearing emergency vehicles and removing their automobile from impeding those vehicles.

Also included in the proposed amendment is the provision to exempt autonomous vehicles from this amendment. Are they nuts? Those vehicles are not proven. They still have numerous accidents; it will be years before an operator can (should) have the confidence to go hands-free from the wheel. The driver should be extra aware when operating these automobiles.

As a side message to our state senators: Do not pass SB 1528. Leave it in committee.

What are POTUS, attorney thinking?

Speaker Pelosi has 'lost control'

It seems Democrats are going nuts nowadays. They banked on Mueller's investigation and were disappointed as badly as they were after the 2016 election. Not only are they still trying to find a way to oust the president, they are fielding a crop of candidates who are guaranteeing a Trump victory in 2020.

The group has come up with truly crazy ideas like the Green New Deal, which would cost the equivalent of the whole world's GDP. They get behind socialism as this country's future when they know it has always failed everywhere it was tried. They have lost all morals with their fear of Roe v. Wade getting overturned.

They want to discard the Electoral College so that California and New York can rule the country's future. Just look at the garbage and feces on the streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles for a glimpse of what that means for us.

They back open borders with no regard for our country's sovereignty. Diversity? Their two 2020 front-runners are both aged white guys.

Pelosi has now lost control of her party's members who are openly defying her.

Is there no one with common sense to espouse what they would do to make our country better and stand out from this crowd?

1159,Some women of color frustrated by Joe Biden's expected 2020 bid,"- Former Vice President Joe Biden’s decision to enter the Democratic presidential race is causing consternation among some Democrats, particularly women of color, who have been hoping for a nominee who better reflects the nation’s diversity.

At the She the People forum, billed as the first presidential forum focused on women of color, Roxy D. Hall Williamson’s shoulders slumped at the mention of Biden, whose official announcement was expected Thursday.

“I know that we have been cultured to feel that only the white man can save us,” the LaMarque, Texas, organizer said Wednesday. “I just don’t feel like Biden is our answer.”

Biden’s candidacy is likely to reshape the Democratic race, which has put the party’s diversity on display. The group of eight 2020 hopefuls who spoke at the forum was comprised of one black man, one black woman, three other women, a Latino man and two white men, all making the case for why they should be the nominee.

Black female voters will play a critical role in the Democratic Party’s attempt to defeat President Donald Trump in 2020. An inability to earn their support in past cycles has spelled political peril for Democratic candidates. For his part, Biden has maintained strong ties to the African American community over the decades.

The raucous, standing-room crowd in the 1,800-person capacity auditorium at the historically black Texas Southern University listened intently as the candidates were questioned about maternal mortality, immigration, tribal sovereignty, income inequality and other issues.

Attending were Sen. Cory Booker, former Obama Cabinet member Julian Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said she was initially eager for Biden to enter the race but now sees “strong alternatives” to him.

“I’m over white men running the country,” Brown said. “I don’t know if him getting in changes the field. He has name recognition, but his strength is also his weakness. Who is his announcing going to surprise?”

She added: “To ignite the kind of base that needs to be ignited to beat Trump, I’m not sure he moves them.”

In interviews, black women repeatedly pointed to a singular issue plaguing Biden’s candidacy: his handling of the 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing of Clarence Thomas and the Senate Judiciary Committee’s treatment of Anita Hill, a black professor who faced a panel of white male lawmakers about her sexual harassment allegations against Thomas. Biden, then a U.S. senator from Delaware, was the committee’s chairman,

Williamson said that she was “still salty” about the role Biden played in the hearing and that “it wasn’t OK then and it’s not OK now.”

Adoneca Fortier, 55, said that she hoped that Biden would more fully address his role in the hearings, perhaps by extending a personal apology to Hill.

“If there is an apology, I think it would be genuine because I think he realizes what’s happening now,” Fortier said, adding that she hoped Biden would choose a woman of color as his running mate.

Cherisse Scott, 44, of Memphis, said the issue is “bigger than Anita Hill.”

“Though we supported President Obama, I think we still wanted to see more happening on behalf of black and brown communities, specifically black communities,” Scott said. “I think Joe Biden’s great. I think Joe Biden was a hell of a vice president. But I wouldn’t vote for him for president.”

Cynthia Dismuke, 53, of Houston, is undecided on a candidate in 2020 but finds Biden’s openness to a female running mate attractive. Nevertheless, she was one of many women at the event who came away impressed with Warren, saying, “She’s not making promises. She has a plan.”

1161,Witnesses help Tampa Police arrest hit and run suspect,"Tampa Police arrested Danielle Swanson, 34 Tuesday night after a serious hit and run accident on Davis Islands.

Police say Swanson hit a man as he crossed East Davis Boulevard and then she just drove away.

A Hillsborough County woman was in a car with her husband and were just leaving Davis Islands when a fast moving car sped by them.

""There was a car that came, actually cut us off the street before and was just swerving left and right,"" said Trish who did not want her last name to be used.

She and her husband then witnessed the accident.

""She didn't even stop and she hit him. A few other cars had stopped and pedestrians came running and she took off, so we followed her,"" said Trish.

They called 9-1-1 and then provided a dispatcher turn by turn descriptions of where they were going.

""She was pretty much just going from curbs to medians erratically, pretty much just all of downtown Tampa and we were on the phone to 9-1-1,"" said Trish.

Tampa Police officers were able to catch up to Swanson at Nebraska Avenue and 17th Street and arrest her.

Police say the couple who followed Swanson may have prevented other serious accidents.

""We have somebody that's impaired, who already struck somebody and left the scene, so they are a very dangerous driver,"" said Steve Hegarty with the Tampa Police department.

1162,"Boy, 4, dies after being burned while under care of mother's boyfriend, police say","Khalil Jabali, of Miami Gardens, is facing charges of aggravated child abuse and molestation of a child in connection with two separate incidents.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - A 4-year-old boy died Wednesday, days after he was burned while under the care of his mother's boyfriend, Miami Gardens police said.

According to a police report, Khalil Jabali, 23, was watching his girlfriend's three children Sunday while she was at work when the woman's son was burned by hot water that had been boiled in the microwave.

Police said Jabali called his girlfriend to tell her that the boy had wet his bed and was burned by hot water he had left in the bathroom when her younger child started crying.

Explaining that he had boiled water in the microwave so he could wash the boy's wet clothes, Jabali told police he left a bowl of hot water on the bathroom sink while he was in another room checking on the other child. When he returned to the bathroom, Jabali said he found the boy on the floor moaning and his skin peeling off.

The boy's mother left work and, along with Jabali, took her son to Jackson North Medical Center. He was then transferred to the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.

Police said the boy had burns to 15 percent of his body.

The boy also had other injuries, including bleeding around the brain and the chest cavity and broken ribs, authorities said.

The boy's body was taken to the Miami-Dade County medical examiner’s office, where an official cause of death will be determined.

Jabali was initially arrested on an aggravated child abuse charge. It's unclear whether that charge will be upgraded.

Jabali also faces a molestation charge involving a 6-year-old girl.

He remains in custody at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center without bond.

1164,Man charged in machete attack at Indialantic homeless site,"CLOSE Crimeline accepts tips and offers rewards to tipsters - while protecting your privacy. Call 1-800-423-8477. GINNY BEAGAN/FLORIDA TODAY Wochit

A 50-year-old man who authorities said chased and attacked a person with a machete at a homeless campsite in Indialantic, remains jailed.

Ronald Basco, described as homeless, was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon after a witness called Brevard County sheriff’s deputies to report the incident. Deputies were called about 2 p.m. to a homeless camp at 1745 N. SR A1A to investigate reports of a disturbance. Deputies arrived and found a man lying on the ground alongside the highway with a laceration to his finger and minor injuries to his lower extremities, reports show.

The victim told deputies that Basco pursued him with a machete, prompting him to throw his hands up in self-defense. The victim told deputies that Basco then struck him in the ribs and head, reports show.

It was the second such machete attack – both unrelated - at a homeless camp in less than a month. Police point out that machetes are often used as tools to clear land or chop wood in a homeless camp. In the last incident, Melbourne police reported that two people were injured in that April 1 incident in a homeless camp off of Sarno Road. One person was taken into custody in that case.

In the latest incident, deputies located Basco at Nance Park still in possession of the machete – contained within a sheath hanging from his belt - and took him into custody. Basco told investigators that he went looking for the victim because he was assaulted the night before by someone the victim knew and wanted to question him about it. He also said that he kept the machete as self-defense.

Basco was transported to the Brevard County Jail Complex. A hearing date has been set for May 23.

1166,'I can't contact the woman I love': Man accused of killing Chuluota family pens letter,"0 'I can't contact the woman I love': Man accused of killing Chuluota family pens letter

CHULUOTA, Fla. - New evidence was submitted Tuesday in the case of a Chuluota man accused of killing his parents and brother in their home.

The evidence is a letter Grant Amato wrote to the girlfriend of a pod mate at the Seminole County jail.

The handwritten letter is six pages long and addressed to Ryan Cooney, of Parish, Florida. Cooney is the girlfriend of a fellow inmate of Amato at the Seminole County jail.

“Hello Ryan, my name is Grant. I have become somewhat of a celebrity for something I never did and something that has robbed me of my entire family and life,” the letter starts.

Amato goes on to open up about his own love life involving an online Bulgarian call girl named Silvie—the same woman for whom prosecutors say Amato stole more than $200,000 from his parents and brother to pay.

Investigators allege Amato killed his parents and brother after he was kicked out of their Chuluota home for continuing to contact her.

“I am sure you have heard the terrible things about me and my girlfriend that the media have lied about. Unfortunately for me, I can’t contact the woman I love while I’m in here,” he wrote. “I know the pain of being separated from the woman you love.”

Amato even wrote about the possibility of a future double date, writing, “We have even decided to take a cruise once all this jail stuff is behind us (you and him with my girl and I).”

Amato will be back in court Thursday, where he again will ask a judge to reconsider pre-trial release.

ORLANDO - The man who claimed to be a cotton-tailed crusader after he was caught on video fighting in an Easter Bunny costume in Orlando is wanted in New Jersey, according to a report from the Tampa Bay Times.

Antoine McDonald said he was wearing a bunny costume Saturday night on Orange Avenue, near SAKS Comedy Club, when he said he saw a man involved in an altercation with a woman so he decided to step in.

Read News 6 story here

McDonald told News 6 said he's not usually a violent person.

""I am the type of person to avoid fights by any means necessary, but in that situation, I would fight any day,"" McDonald said.

McDonald didn't know the woman or man involved, but he said he will not tolerate disrespect toward women.

After the video of McDonald brawling with an unknown man in downtown went viral the Tampa Bay Times found McDonald has a criminal past and is currently wanted in New Jersey.

According to the Times, McDonald was accused of two armed robberies on New Year's Day in 2017, and the following year McDonald and an accomplice were caught on camera burglarizing a car. Police in New Jersey obtained a warrant for McDonald's arrest.

McDonald left the state and was later arrested in Pasco County, according to the Times.

McDonald, whose identity was unknown because of the fluffy mask, came forward Monday and provided his version of events to News 6 and multiple other local and national news outlets.

No one was arrested after Orlando police broke up the fight.

The fear of arrest did cross McDonald's mind, he told News 6.

""The thought went through my head when the cop came over, but you know I didn't leave. I didn't run. I said, 'You know what? This man deserved it.' You know, if I have to be arrested for this to prove a point that this shouldn't be happening, then so be it,"" McDonald said.

News 6 is working to verify McDonald's criminal record. Check back for updates.

1176,Computer help: How to rid yourself of sophisticated 'ransomware',"(Photo: Thinkstock)

Q: I have a Lenova laptop with Windows 10. For several weeks now I have been getting full-screen pop-ups on my machine, complete with a woman's voice, telling me that if I do not call the number listed in the pop-up all manner of terrible things will happen to my internet connection. The message claims to be from Microsoft -- but of course I know well enough that it's not. What's strange is that this only appears when I'm accessing my Comcast email in my email program and not when I surf the web or view my Gmail account. Once this message appears, I can only shut down my system to get rid of it. I called Comcast for help but they could not do much. Any idea what I can do?

—Roseann Romans Stuart

A: This sounds like an infection known as Tech Support Spyware, which in itself is a type of ""ransomware."" This is a malicious item that's been designed to block access to the internet or part of your system (such as general Windows functionality, email, internet, etc.) until you pay it a specific sum of money. Often it takes on the persona of a larger entity, like Microsoft, as a means of adding validity to its claim, though as you've correctly pointed out it's not really Microsoft behind this (they would never contact you in this manner — ever!) and paying the amount requested will do nothing more than provide the culprits with your credit card information. Scams like these can be sophisticated in setup, especially since the virus only seems to appear when you are working with your email program. Because of this, there's a good chance the virus was transmitted to you via your email account, most likely as an attachment that you thought was safe to click on but really wasn't.

Fixing this type of infection can be complicated, especially if the virus has been on your system for a few weeks and has had a chance to inflict some damage to the machine. Basic instructions for removing it can be found at this website: https://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-tech-support-scam-popups/. But full repair and recovery cannot be guaranteed with these steps, since it's impossible to know how much damage the virus has already caused to this point.

With that being said, if you feel the process listed at the website above is beyond your comfort level or know-how, or if the steps outlined below do not solve the problem, please take the computer to a local technician for additional help.

1179,"Man accused of killing parents, brother after paying Bulgarian call girl $200K granted bail","0 Man accused of killing parents, brother after paying Bulgarian call girl $200K granted bail

SANFORD, Fla. - A 29-year-old man accused in the death of three family members could be allowed to leave jail.

Grant Amato is accused of killing his parents and his brother at their home in January after a dispute about him sending $200,000 of the family's money to a Bulgargian call girl.

Amato was granted a $750,000 bail Thursday afternoon.

TRENDING NOW:

Jared Shapiro, Amato's defense attorney, said Thursday that although it is unusual for a suspect in three killings to receive bail, his client is entitled to it because he has cooperated with investigators.

""He was unemployed at the time of his arrest, and we're not aware of any significant assets that he has to post bond,"" Shapiro said.

Prosecutors said they had sought a $25 million bail because Amato is computer savvy and could create fake travel documents. They also cited the fact that he faces the death penalty if he is convicted.

""(The call girl) certainly is one incentive for him to leave this country and go to Bulgaria,"" Assistant State Attorney Stewart Stone said.

Defense attorney Jeff Dowdy said he sought a $150,000 bail because Amato did not flee after the slayings and he has cooperated with investigators.

""There is still no physical forensic evidence linking him to this crime,"" he said.

The judge asked whether Amato can afford to pay his bail.

""We're going to explore that,"" Dowdy said. ""We know he does have family resources.""

If Amato is released after paying bail, he will be forbidden from leaving Central Florida and from accessing computers or the internet, and he must wear a GPS-enabled ankle monitor.

1180,NFL Draft: Top defensive players available by position,"- Some of the top defensive prospects, by position, available in the NFL draft (x-indicates early entrant to draft):

DEFENSIVE END/EDGE RUSHER

Position outlook: This draft is stacked with defensive linemen of all types. The edge rushers and ends could dominate the first 10 picks.

x-Nick Bosa, 6-foot-4, 266 pounds, Ohio State.

Strengths: Quick off the edge and relentless, just like his brother, Chargers star Joey Bosa.

Weaknesses: Maybe some durability concerns because last year's season-ending injury cut short the one season in which Bosa would have gotten a large volume of snaps.

Fact: Bosa had 29 tackles for loss, including 17 1-2 sacks in 30 games with the Buckeyes.

Gone by: Top three, just like his brother.

Josh Allen, 6-5, 262, Kentucky.

Strengths: Size, speed, athleticism are all ideal. Even some room to add a few pounds if necessary.

Weaknesses: Some technique could use polishing, but not much to complain about.

Fact: Won Bednarik Award and Nagurski Trophy as top defensive player in college football last season.

Gone by: Maybe he lasts to No. 5?

x-Rashan Gary, 6-4, 277, Michigan.

Strengths: Top-flight athlete with good power, long arms and sturdy against the run.

Weaknesses: Pass-rush production was spotty. Had 10 1-2 sacks in three seasons, though was often used to tie up blockers.

Fact: Consensus No. 1 overall recruit coming out of high school in 2016.

Gone by: If he slips out of the top 10, it won't be far.

Montez Sweat, 6-6, 260, Mississippi State.

Strengths: Among freaky athletes, Sweat might be the freakiest with his 4.4 speed.

Weaknesses: A little top heavy means he needs to upgrade against the run.

Fact: Two-time first-team all-Southeastern Conference and second-team All-American last season.

Gone by: Pick No. 15.

Clellin Ferrell, 6-4, 264, Clemson.

Strengths: Solid in most areas and good at getting off blocks to finish plays.

The case of missing firefighter Brandy Hall is what brought retired detective Sid LaDow and me together.

And when we started becoming good friends, I knew I wouldn't have him around for very long. In fact, I'd joke that he had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel.

It wasn't his age. It wasn't the chain smoking. It wasn't the hacking cough or the bad ticker. It was love.

Sid lost his wife Sue in late 2016 and wasn't shy about telling me that he missed her terribly and wanted to be with her again. He'd set a rose on her nightstand daily. He'd set out a cup for her coffee. He'd talk to her.

He'd tell her he loved her. He'd tell her he would be along soon. But most of the time he would talk to her about Brandy Hall, the subject of Season 3 of our Murder on the Space Coast podcast.

""I think about Brandy every day and when I pray every night. It's an everyday occurrence with me. She's never far from my thoughts,"" Sid told me last year. ""And my wife, too, when she was still alive, she would pray every single day. She was my best cheerleader. I miss her something terrible.""

Buy Photo Retired Detective Sid LaDow was tireless when it came to the Brandy Hall case. Here he is in 2018 discussing the case at the""Where is Brandy Hall?"" podcast event at Surfside Playhouse in Cocoa Beach. (Photo: MALCOLM DENEMARK/FLORIDA TODAY)

Now, the old detective has made his way home.

He died on Wednesday at the age of 79 and I am selfishly heartbroken that I have lost such a close and dear friend. I will never get to see his Facebook messages pop up — that man loved using Facebook. I will never get to tease him again about wanting to meet for lunch at 11 in the morning; who eats lunch at that time? I'll never be able to get on him about his smoking — he'd quip that the long coughing spells clear out his lungs. I'll never hear him talk about Bonnie and Clyde again, his two Shetland sheep dogs I took for a week last year while he was hospitalized.

I never told him they were afraid of walking on my concrete patio to get to the backyard and so they made my living room their personal toilet. I never knew such small dogs could go so much.

Earlier this month he told me he paid $125 to get his hearing aid fixed and that now he ""could hear a gnat fart at 200 yards!""

He also told me that quitting smoking was easy. ""I've done it about 5,000 times,"" he'd laugh.

I'll miss the old detective, and I know I'm not alone. As soon as I found out he had passed, the texts, messages and calls started and haven't stopped. How do you pay tribute to such an incredible man? A man who exemplified what a law enforcement officer should be? A man who was a true champion for justice in addition to being a great friend?

I wanted to write the best thing I've ever written to honor him. But it's tough writing with tears in my eyes and this pain in my heart.

So, here goes my friend. This one's for you.

Sid LaDow, was larger than life. I know we throw that phrase around way too often but in Sid's case it was true. He was like a character from a John Grisham novel. He was a combination of Robert Mitchum and Peter Falk.

He spoke in this slow mid-west country drawl and would look you dead in the eye when he did. He grew up on a farm in a tiny Illinois town called Pleasant Hill in Pike County close to the Missouri border and he'd reminisce about sitting on the main drag watching cars go by as a kid.

When duty called Sid responded bravely for the country he loved. He proudly served in Vietnam where he was part of the the U.S Army 1st Cavalry Division. He commanded the ""A"" Company 27th Maintenance Battalion in support of the 1st Brigade. He would retire a Major.

After the war he wasn't sure what he wanted to do. He found himself in Florida and in his own words ""fiddled around.""

""After a while I said 'maybe I can be a cop,'"" he told me. ""So, I went around to the academy and I applied at Palm Bay and fortunately I was hired.""

Now, according to Sid, the chief of police at the time didn't have money for new uniforms. ""So, he said go on back to detectives till I get some money. He never got the money and I stayed back there for almost 20 years. So, that's how I got started in it. I was very lucky back there. I was solving some crimes and making some arrests.""

He would later return to military duty in advance of the first Gulf War and recently told me about helping plan logistics and supplies in event of war during that time. But his real heroics came doing police work.

Buy Photo Retired Detective Sid LaDow was tireless when it came to the Brandy Hall case. Here he is in 2018 discussing the case with Brandy's mother, Debbie Rogge at the""Where is Brandy Hall?"" podcast event at Surfside Playhouse in Cocoa Beach. (Photo: MALCOLM DENEMARK/FLORIDA TODAY)

There was a serial rapist he helped bring to justice as well as other high profile cases he worked before he retired in 1995. But it always bothered him that he hadn't solved Ed Smith's disappearance. Smith had last been seen in 1988 and his family and the police feared foul play.

It's no surprise that 10 years after retiring from the force, when I started writing about Ed Smith, Sid was back working the case for free along with his buddy (and mine) Tom Davis with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

When I asked him why, he told me that he owed it to Ed Smith’s family and besides, he added, it was a chance to get back in the saddle again. Davis had promised Smith's daughter they would solve it and they did.

Brown, Michael R. Brown)

Davis texted me after learning of Sid's passing.

""Loved the old warrior,"" he wrote.

""I did too,"" was my response.

Years after the Smith case, Sid would call again. He wanted to shake things up in the investigation of a missing firefighter. This time he was asked by the Palm Bay Police to investigate along with another retired law enforcement officer Carroll ""Doc"" Jones.

Buy Photo Brandy Hall, missing firefighter (Photo: FLORIDA TODAY FILE)

It would become Sid's great obsession and he would spend roughly the last decade of his life fighting for justice and searching for a woman he never met, Brandy Hall. He — along with Doc Jones — would interview dozens of people, write in-depth reports, authorize polygraph tests, conduct searches and much more.

He said he owed it to Brandy's parents, her children and husband to keep working. That's the kind of person he was.

Earlier this year, private investigator Nic Sandberg and I helped Sid hang more ""Brandy Hall: Still Missing"" signs all over the Grant Seafood Festival. He'd always done it himself but his health was declining rapidly.

""I’m gonna live long enough even though I’ve got some serious problems,"" he'd say. ""I’m gonna live long enough to get her back.""

And just earlier this month, the old detective and I found ourselves back at the pond where Brandy's truck was found the afternoon she went missing in 2006. He had to stop to catch his breath twice while walking into the wooded area.

Something happened at the pond that really captures who Sid LaDow was.

We came across new tools, children's toys, power tools, DVDs, GPS and more. I didn't know what to make of it but Sid instinctively knew that someone had stolen a vehicle and dumped everything from the vehicle right there in that spot. He noticed a handful of the same business card and wound up calling. Sure enough the person was relieved to get their tools and other personal belongings back.

Sid was thoughtful.

He would send Facebook messages to my wife and daughter just to say hello or to share something about his dogs, which he always called pups.

Sid Ladow's famous homemade hooch. He gave this bottle for my birthday last year. (Photo: John A. Torres)

For my birthday last year he made me a batch of homemade hooch he called ""Old Gag and Puke."" It was like a cross between NyQuil and gasoline. I only wish I had saved some to drink in his honor tonight.

Slowly over the last year and more rapidly in recent months, Sid unofficially passed the investigation over to Sandberg, who is tenaciously working the case for free for Brandy's mother, Debbie Rogge.

Buy Photo Debbie Rogge, mother of Brandy Hall, attended the search. On Wednesday, renewed searches began in Malabar and Palm Bay for the remains of missing firefighter Brandy Hall, who disappeared more than 12 years ago. (Photo: TIM SHORTT/ FLORIDA TODAY)

I think it was Sid's confidence that the investigation would continue and that the baton would remain in capable hands that allowed him to stop fighting the pain and the suffering and close his eyes one last time.

""Now he knows where Brandy is,"" Rogge said, after telling me how much Sid meant to her. ""Maybe he can lead us to her.""

Sid leaves behind two sons, a daughter, five grandchildren and four great grandchildren — one of whom was born this month. We had one of those 11 a.m. lunches last week at Sonny's and he couldn't stop talking about the latest addition to his clan.

I have no doubt the Brandy Hall case will be solved. And when it does, I'll pour myself my own version of ""Old Gag and Puke"" and toast my buddy, knowing his work helped lead us to her.

And knowing he is home. God bless you Sid. Thanks for being my friend.

1186,South Carolina House gives near final backing to heartbeat abortion bill,"- The South Carolina House gave near final approval to a bill Wednesday that would ban almost all abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, but the measure may have little chance of clearing the Senate.

The House voted 70-31 to give the bill second reading after more than five hours of debate. One last routine vote could take place as early as Thursday before the bill heads to the Senate.

Other legislatures in Kentucky, Ohio and Georgia have passed fetal heartbeat abortion bills this year. But in South Carolina, even if the bill passes the House, it would need a two-thirds vote from the less conservative Senate because it had missed a legislative deadline. And time was running short, with only seven working days remaining in the legislative session after Wednesday.

Supporters called for final House and Senate passage, saying all life should be considered sacred once a heartbeat can be detected.

But much of Wednesday's debate arose from opposition by Democratic lawmakers, who questioned the motives of debating a bill that would likely face an immediate legal challenge and be ruled unconstitutional by the courts.

Democratic Rep. David Mack said lawmakers take up proposed abortion restrictions year after year and need to refrain from passing laws concerning women's bodies.

""This waste of time is just very sickening to me,"" the North Charleston lawmaker said.

The bill, drafted by Republican Rep. John McCravy, would require medical professionals to test for a detectable heartbeat before any abortion is performed.

McCravy said that if a heartbeat is detected, the bill would require the medical professional to ask the mother if she would like to hear the heartbeat and then advise the woman of the chances of her successfully carrying the pregnancy to full term.

A heartbeat typically can be detected around the sixth week of pregnancy, so early that many women are sometimes unaware they are pregnant.

""We're forcing women from across the state of South Carolina to fight the issue of time,"" Democratic Rep. Justin Bamberg said.

Bamberg proposed a number of amendments to filibuster the legislation, a similar strategy he took during a contentious debate during a House committee meeting earlier this month. They all have failed. The Bamberg Democrat's proposals included allowing registered nurses, physician assistance and telemedicine providers to perform abortions. Other provisions would have created a fund to pay for women to travel outside of South Carolina to get an abortion, as well as a fund for physicians to be trained on using the ultrasound to detect the heartbeat.

""We can be so comfortable here in Columbia dictating what women can and cannot do with their bodies and there's never a discussion of how this can impact their pocketbook or checkbook,"" Bamberg said.

Bamberg ultimately withdrew all his proposed amendments, saying he did so out of respect to the leadership and their colleagues after what they deemed inevitable House approval of the measure.

""It's frustrating to come to Columbia every year and every single year we have to take up something regarding abortion,"" Bamberg said. ""Let's make sure we're doing every single thing possible to invest in, fight for the children that are already here, that are suffering or sick and dying, and that's all I ask for the body.""

The only amendment to pass after several hours of debate allowed for exemptions to the ban in cases of rape or incest, proposed by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of Charleston. McCravy opposed that amendment to his bill.

""The question is whether another life should be taken because of a bad act,"" McCravy told fellow lawmakers. ""Vote your conscious on this amendment.""

While Democratic lawmakers supported expanding the exceptions, they criticized language in the proposal that would require physicians to use their judgment to determine whether it was their ""belief"" that the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. They said they wondered why a doctor would not trust a woman about that kind of trauma.

""I apologize to all the women in South Carolina who have been raped, who have been subjected to incest,"" Democrat John King of Rock Hill said. He protested what he called the actions of ""the men who sit in these chambers here and across the hall who feel it is in our interest to make decisions for the women of South Carolina and especially for women who have been raped or subject to incest.""

1187,Long prosecutor reflects on 34 years spent waiting,"Related Headlines DeSantis signs death warrant for Bobby Joe Long

- One of the most infamous killers in the history of Tampa is scheduled to be executed next month.

Barring any last minute stays, Robert ""Bobby Joe"" Long, 65, will be executed at the state prison near Starke Thursday, May 23 at 6 p.m.

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed his death warrant Tuesday.

Long killed at least 10 women in the Tampa area in the early 1980s. He was sentenced to death in 1985 and has spent nearly 34 years on Florida's death row.

The state prosecutor who helped convince a 12-member jury to vote unanimously for Long's execution has been waiting for this day to come.

""People like Bobby Joe Long don't deserve to stay alive because of the crimes they committed,"" said former state prosecutor Mike Benito. ""These weren't just murders... He brutally raped all these women before he killed them and he just discarded them on the side of the road.""

Long's arrest came after he abducted a young woman, Lisa McVey, who escaped and gave clues to detectives that helped them catch Long. Last year a movie was made about her ordeal, ""Believe Me: The Abduction of Lisa McVey.""

Lisa McVey Noland became a Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputy and has said she wants to witness Long's execution.

Long's is the first death warrant to be signed by Gov. DeSantis, who was seven years old when Long was sentenced to death.

""I'm sure those women he killed would have liked 30 more years on this planet, but Bobby Joe Long decides they're not going to have those 30 more years. But our system allows him 30 more years. It's a travesty,"" said Benito.

Rosalie Bolin, a death penalty opponent, says executing Long ""Will accomplish nothing. It will be just another killing,"" she says.

Long is among the longest-serving inmates on Florida's death row. His lawyers have filed numerous appeals to state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States, but currently, no court stands in the way of the scheduled execution next month.",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/long-prosecutor-reflects-on-34-years-spent-waiting,2019-04-24T22:10:42Z,FOX 13 NEWS,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA",FL,33609
1189,Additional SR 40 crash victims' names released,"Florida Highway Patrol troopers have identified the occupants in one of two vehicles involved in a head-on crash on West State Road 40 that claimed the lives of three people over the weekend.

The names of the people in the 2012 Chevy Silverado were: Gerita S. Waymire, 78, Carolyn Annette Waymire, 54 and Michael Eugene Waymire, 57, all from Dunnellon.

Troopers said the 78-year-old woman was pronounced deceased at the scene. The 54-year-old woman and the 57-year-old man are siblings, and the victim was their mother, FHP officials said. The brother and sister are at Ocala Regional Medical Center in critical condition.

In the second vehicle, a 2005 Chevy Cobalt, two people were killed at the location. Their names were released on Sunday. Troopers identified the driver as 36-year-old Justin Matthew Klemm and the passenger as Brandin Drew McCoy, 33, both of Dunnellon.

The wreck occurred in front of Classic Mile Park Training Center, approximately a mile east from Southwest 140th Avenue, at 5:40 p.m. Saturday.

FHP troopers said the Chevy Cobalt was traveling east on SR 40 and the pickup was traveling west. Authorities said that, for unknown reasons, the driver of the Cobalt drove partially off the roadway and, returning to the road, went into the westbound lane. The pickup then collided with the car.



Kim Horton, who witnessed the crash, told the Star-Banner the driver of the Cobalt appeared to be speeding and the driver lost control of the car.

LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) — A suburban Atlanta woman has pleaded guilty to fatally stabbing her husband and four children and seriously injuring another daughter.

WSB-TV reports that 35-year-old Isabel Martinez pleaded guilty but mentally ill Tuesday to five counts of murder and other charges. She was sentenced to five life sentences with the possibility of parole plus 21 years.

The Gwinnett County District Attorney’s Office had declined to seek the death penalty because of Martinez’s mental state.

1192,"Family, coaches remember beginnings for Taylor, Gardner-Johnson, Dean","Former Cocoa High football coach John Wilkinson remembered first meeting each of his former Tigers likely to be selected this weekend in the NFL Draft in Nashville, but the first time he saw Jawaan Taylor stood out.

Now the head coach at New Smyrna Beach, Wilkinson recalled seeing Taylor for the first time in the cafeteria at Kennedy Middle School.

""I guess he was in eighth grade,"" Wilkinson said. ""I remember being in the lunch room and seeing him come in, and he was so big. He had to be 300 pounds and 6-2 or 6-3.""

Thursday night, Wilkinson will be at Taylor's table in downtown Nashville when the NFL Draft begins at 8 p.m. Taylor, the former Florida Gators and Cocoa Tigers offensive tackle, measured at 6-foot-5 and 312 pounds at the recent NFL Combine.

He is now the consensus No. 1 offensive tackle available according to draft analysts, and he was one of a couple dozen college players from around the country invited to be on site as selections are announced.

See the complete list: Where were 25 Brevard HS grads taken in the NFL Draft?

Draft rankings: Mock drafts and 2019 Brevard County products

Experts have predicted Taylor will go in the top 10, with the consensus expecting the Jacksonville Jaguars to take him at the seventh pick of the first round. Former Astronaut High and UF player Wilber Marshall, drafted 11th overall by the Chicago Bears in 1984, is the highest draft pick among Brevard high school products to this point.

The next two locals expected to come off the draft board play the same position as the area's last NFL pick, former Holy Trinity and Gators defensive back Marcus Maye, taken in the second round by the Jets in 2017, 39th overall.

Gators safety Chauncey Gardner-Johnson, who also played for Wilkinson at Cocoa and announced after last season he would enter the draft following his junior year of college, appears likely to be taken anywhere from the late first round to the third. Many experts list him as a high second-rounder.

""A couple of months ago, a year ago, I knew in the back of my mind this could happen,"" Gardner-Johnson's mom, Delatron Johnson said Tuesday. ""Now, the knowing is starting to turn into emotions. I feel like a pregnant woman. My emotions are all over the place.""

The draft starts at 7 p.m. Friday and noon Saturday. Following the first two Cocoa grads, fellow alum Jamel Dean, who played college ball at Auburn, should be drafted as well. If they aren't drafted, former Tigers Freddie Booth-Lloyd, Jamel Jackson and James Folston Jr. could find themselves in NFL camps as free agents.

The draft will be broadcast live on the NFL Network, ABC and ESPN.

Longtime Brevard County football coach Mike Vogt, Taylor's offensive line coach as a ninth-grader and senior, said when Florida Gators coaches first watched film of the offensive line prospect, they thought the video was set on a fast speed.

""He was driven his senior year,"" Vogt recalled. ""Halfway through that year, he just started dominating.""

Cocoa to Auburn to NFL: Jamel Dean declares for NFL draft

Both Gardner-Johnson and Dean graduated in December, Dean in 2014 with a 3.8 GPA, a year ahead of his former teammate. Former principal Stephanie Soliven, now an assistant superintendent for Brevard Schools, recalled the days when a younger Dean thought his future was in another field.

""He was always track. That was going to be his sport. He was tall and lanky with these big glasses. That is the picture that I have in my mind. To see him now, he's obviously not lanky and wearing big glasses.""

Dean, measured at 6-foot-1 and 206 pounds at the NFL Combine, was a draft question mark in the minds of many NFL analysts because of a history of knee problems. But he ran the second-fastest 40-yard dash of any defensive back, a 4.30, at the NFL Combine.

Gardner-Johnson, who ran a 4.48, typically has been rated higher, and he will host a Thursday night draft party for family and friends at the Rockledge Youth Football Field on Cogswell Street.

Soliven's top memory of him as a ninth-grader was a mix of determination of humility.

""He ran everywhere and talked to everybody, exactly how you see him today, doing everything 100 percent. He came in knowing what he wanted, but I remember how humble he was about the older players and how much he respected them.""

PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) - Helen ""Wendy"" Laroche was just 21, recently married and starting to take college classes when she was murdered while working at a convenience store in Port Richey.

It was June 29, 1986, and Wendy was working the night shift at the Gas 'N' Save located at 10019 US Highway 19. The convenience store has since been torn down. A Home Depot and 7-Eleven are now in its place. Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Dave Laroche first met Wendy when they were students at Hudson High School. They worked at a K-Mart together, shared many of the same friends and married after they graduated high school.

""She liked to have fun. She had a great sense of humor,"" Laroche said.

Laroche is now the principal of Hudson High School. He says Wendy had a lifetime in front of her.

""Sadly, she had just started classes - I believe that summer or that spring before that summer - before this happened,"" he said.

The night of the murder, he visited his wife at the store to trade out cars.

""I stayed with her for a few minutes, - 10, 15 minutes I recall - and everything seemed normal to me,"" said Laroche.

Laroche left his wife's car in the parking lot with her driver’s license on the seat of her car and said goodbye.

Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

By pure coincidence, an off-duty Pasco County Sheriff's Deputy came into the store after Wendy's husband. William Lawless wasn't in uniform. He was simply looking for transmission fluid for his personal car.

Years later, Lawless vividly remembers walking into the store and not being able to find anyone.

""You know, there wasn't a lot of convenience stores in those days like there is now. As a matter of fact, this one was on the west side of 19, kind of where Home Depot is now and it was very secluded,"" said Lawless.

So it seemed out of place to the deputy as he walked in and wasn't able to find an employee.

""So finally I did the old ‘ahem, anybody here?' And she popped up from behind the podium, which I thought was odd. And so my comments to her were, 'you're a woman, you're here at night by yourself, you need to be more aware of your surroundings,'"" Lawless recalled.

He remembers Wendy didn't have much to say about his comments.

Detectives say she was killed minutes after Lawless left the store. Another customer found her lifeless body in a back room. She was already dead and the victim of multiple gunshots.

Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

A receipt for the transmission fluid purchased by Lawless shows he was in the store just about 10 minutes before the next customer found Wendy's body. It's even possible the killer was already in the store as Lawless arrived and could have hidden in the back room.

""Reality, he probably was,"" said Lawless.

Homicide Detective Todd Koenig is assigned to look at all of the unsolved murders in Pasco County.

""The Pasco Sheriff's Office doesn't just quit working these cases. We want the family to know that,"" Koenig said.

Koenig says physical evidence shows Wendy was shot at very close range.

""Some of the injuries that she sustained looked more personal,"" said Koenig.

That led the original detectives to speculate that Wendy may have known her killer.

""Typically when we find that, we find it was more personal, more of a hate, more of they want to get up close and make sure that it's done,"" said Koenig.

At the start of the investigation, detectives considered everyone who went to the store that night as a suspect - including Wendy's husband.

""I was one of the people that they were focused on,"" Dave Laroche remembered.

He says his young wife didn't seem to have any ongoing arguments with anyone. He just remembers having to answer a lot of questions right after losing his young wife.

""It was horrible. A horrible night, a horrible experience,"" said Laroche.

Detective Koenig says it's part of normal investigative procedures to look at everyone the victim knows or who had contact with her.

""You start within their circle and work your way out because the majority of them, unless it's a random robbery, it's somebody that knows them,"" said Koenig.

The homicide detective has now pored over old case files, reading and rereading the original reports.

""Guys did a pretty good job back then but there is always something they may have missed. That’s where I come in. I try to look at it again, a fresh set of eyes,"" said Koenig.

He's also using new techniques and technology to look at old physical evidence that's been preserved in the case.

""I've submitted a lot of stuff back to the lab for DNA, still waiting on results back from some of that stuff,"" said Koenig.

One theory that came to light early in the investigation was another young man who had taken an interest in Wendy despite the fact she was married.

""There was one individual that wanted to date her, although she was married, wanted to take her mudding that night,"" said Koenig.

Detectives have never been able to prove if that person came to the Gas 'N' Save on the night of the murder.

Years after Wendy's life was taken, Dave Laroche has discovered possible clues left at her graveside.

""Sometimes there are flowers, artificial and otherwise, left at the site that I - nobody from my family has ever left there,"" said Laroche.

He says Wendy no longer has any family in the area and no one he knows is leaving the flowers. He admits it could be something as simple as one of her friends stopping by to remember her, but he would like to know to clear up the questions.

In the meantime, Detective Koenig is continuing to work all aspects of the case.

""The feeling isn't as much as you solve the case as it is giving closure to a family member,"" said Koenig.

Dave Laroche says closure would mean a great deal to him.

""It would mean, it would mean a lot,"" a tearful Laroche told us.

There is a reward offered in the case. According to Crime Stoppers, ""anonymous tipsters who contact Crime Stoppers of Tampa Bay and give information, which law enforcement confirms led directly to the arrest of an adult or juvenile in an unsolved crime or the arrest of a wanted fugitive will be eligible for a reward of up to $3,000.""

In honor of National Infertility Awareness Week, Dreyer spoke about a recent miscarriage and her infertility struggle, and said she hopes to “shed the stigma” by sharing her truth.

Due to her emergency C-section with her first-born, Dreyer is unable to conceive, and is now exploring alternative methods. In fact, about 10 percent of women experience difficulty getting or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

We thought we'd shine a light on all the celebrities who've spoken about their own struggles or unique situations.

Kicking off our list is Banks, who referenced her ""broken belly"" in a blog entry back in 2011. The post, in which Banks introduces her newborn son, Felix, reads, in part: ""After years of trying to get pregnant, exploring the range of fertility treatments, all unsuccessful, our journey led us to gestational surrogacy: we make a 'baby cake' and bake it in another woman's 'oven.'""

Really, it only feels appropriate that Banks used some humor in her analogy. Banks and her husband went on to have a second son, also through surrogacy, about a year after Felix's arrival.

The “America’s Next Top Model” host welcomed a son in January 2016 who was born through gestational surrogacy. But Banks did a lot of in vitro fertilization leading up to that. She said once in an interview, “On Cycle 22's final runway, at the [Walt] Disney Concert Hall, I had to go into a back closet and give myself my final shot, and that was the seventh round of IVF.”

Bassett, of “American Horror Story” fame, alongside her husband, Courtney B. Vance, has spoken publicly several times about how long it took to conceive the couple’s twins. Bassett told Oprah the pair eventually opted to use a surrogate, after enduring seven years of failed fertility treatments. Bassett has also spoken to Jet magazine about the couple's struggles.

4.) Beyonce

Beyonce proved she was one of us after all, when she shared in her 2013 HBO documentary, “Beyoncé: Life Is but a Dream,” that she suffered a miscarriage before Blue Ivy was born, and then reportedly got ""frustrated"" after unsuccessful IVF treatments. Queen Bey and husband Jay-Z were even looking into surrogates and adoption, according to published reports, before the couple went on to have two healthy twins, Rumi and Sir, carried by Beyonce herself.

The “Fast and the Furious” actress spoke to Cosmopolitan magazine in October 2014 about motherhood and the experience of using a surrogate. She said, in part, ""I couldn't carry a baby. At first, I was scared. I had no idea what [surrogacy] entailed. Then I started researching agencies. ... [Surrogacy] taught me a lot to have to rely on someone else to carry my baby for me, because I'm such a private and self-sufficient person. It's the most intimate leap of faith and trust you can take.""

6.) Mariah Carey

When Carey got together with her (now-ex) husband Nick Cannon, Carey was nearly 40. But the two wanted to have a baby together, so they tried naturally at first -- and suffered a miscarriage in 2008. After some continued struggles, the pair decided to go through IVF. They successfully went on to have a set of healthy twins, perhaps thanks to the advice from Carey’s friend, Celine Dion, who recommended acupuncture to reduce Carey's stress levels. It’s been said that acupuncture might improve your chances of pregnancy, in some cases. Carey talked about the practice to Access Hollywood in 2010.

“I had a bunch of miscarriages,” the “Friends” star reportedly said in her Facebook Watch web series, “9 Months with Courteney Cox,” which follows 10 couples with different pregnancy experiences. “But I was lucky enough to have my little girl, Coco, who I had through IVF.”

“If I can share any light or give wisdom to somebody, or hope, of course, I would share anything I can,” Cox told Entertainment Tonight. “I think that’s important.”

8.) Celine Dion

As mentioned above, it was Dion who recommended acupuncture to Carey for help getting and staying pregnant. Dion and her (now late) husband René Angélil started trying for kids when Dion was in her 30s, but they didn't have any luck. Years later and after seven IVF cycles, the couple finally had their sons, first, René-Charles, and then twins Nelson and Eddy.

Regarding those seven IVF cycles, Dion once said in an interview, ""I thought as long as my health permitted me and unless my doctor thought physically I couldn’t do it, then I would go on with the IVF until someone told me to stop.”

9.) Lena Dunham

Dunham has been very open about her decade-long struggle with endometriosis pain -- and she’s even posted about her decision to undergo a hysterectomy at the age of 31. There’s still a chance Dunham could be a mother someday, considering the available options like egg freezing and surrogacy, and she told Vogue that those possibilities, coupled with the idea of adoption, (are) a “thrilling truth I’ll pursue with all my might.”

10.) Jimmy Fallon

Fallon, host of “The Tonight Show” said on “TODAY” that he and his wife, Nancy Juvonen, endured a five-year infertility struggle before having their daughter, Winnie, via a surrogate. ""We've tried a bunch of things,"" he told host Savannah Guthrie. ""Anyone who's tried will know -- it's just awful.""

11.) Camille Grammer

“Speaking of childbirth, I had my children through surrogacy,"" the former star of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills has said, according to a blog. ""If you can’t get pregnant for whatever reason, it’s great to know that there are options available for people that want to have a family. I wish I could have had that experience. I’m just so grateful I had a wonderful surrogate who carried our two children. I have two amazing angels in my life that I love so much. They are such a gift and a blessing from God.”

Grammer was married to Kelsey Grammer from 1997 to 2011. Their kids, Mason and Jude, are now teenagers.

12.) Shawn Johnson

The gold medal-winning former gymnast shared that she felt guilty after miscarrying her first baby.

""I felt sad,"" Johnson said. ""And I remember telling Andrew (East), 'I'm sorry I lost your baby.' I felt like it was something that I did. I didn't take care of the baby well enough. I was stressed out too much. Or I didn't take the right prenatal vitamins. There are all these different guilts and thoughts and negative feelings … like, I failed my baby. … I felt like I was (uninhabitable). Like, no baby's going to live inside this belly.""

The good news is, just more than a year later, the two are expecting!

13.) Khloe Kardashian

Getty Images

After years of wanting a baby -- which was pretty well-documented on reality TV during Kardashian’s marriage to then-NBA star Lamar Odom -- she finally got one: her daughter, True, was born in April 2018. Odom was out of the picture by then, and Cleveland Cavaliers forward Tristan Thompson is True’s father, but that’s neither here nor there.

Kardashian had explored the possibilities of parenthood with Odom, and at the time, the situation on TV seemed to be chalked up to unexplained infertility. When Kardashian was questioned about this years later, she clarified: “I did all my treatments, but then when we did further testing, we realized I was NOT the one with the issue. ... It takes two to have a baby.”

14.) Nicole Kidman

Kidman and husband Keith Urban surprised fans in 2010 when they announced the birth of their daughter, Faith, born through a gestational carrier. Kidman has since spoken openly about her ups and downs with fertility, according to ABC News.

15.) Hoda Kotb

The “TODAY” host had always wanted to be a mom, but a battle with breast cancer a decade ago left her unable to conceive, according to Southern Living. ""Sometimes in your life, things just don't work out for whatever reason, so you say, 'Well, I wasn't meant to have that.' But it was really hard to come to terms with it."" Fast-forward to today, Kotb has two adopted daughters: Hope Catherine and Haley Joy.

(For what it’s worth, perhaps this is proof that it’s never too late! Kotb became a new mother at the age of 52!)

16.) Jana Kramer

The country music star spoke to People magazine about getting pregnant naturally with both of her children, after two failed IVF cycles. What are the odds?

17.) Joan Lunden

Getty Images

The former “Good Morning America” host has joked that she’s the “poster child” for infertility. Having children through a surrogate was still a bit of a novelty when Lunden did it in 2003 and again in 2005.

“Families these days are made in many different ways,” she once said to Newsmax Health. “It’s really a wonderful amazing thing that there are women in this world who are so selfless that they will carry a child for another couple, that will help them make a family.”

Lunden even did a big spread with People magazine back in 2003, detailing her circumstances.

18.) Maria Menounos

Menounos has been very public about her journey, chatting about it on her satellite radio show, posting about it on social media -- heck, she’s even Snapchatted her egg-retrieval process.

Read the interview she did with Health magazine in June 2016. At last check, she and her husband, longtime love Keven Undergaro, were considering using a surrogate.

19.) Michelle Obama

The former first lady shared in her memoir that she and her husband, former President Barack Obama, conceived their daughters, Sasha and Malia, via IVF. Michelle also said in the book that she felt very alone after suffering a miscarriage, about 20 years ago.

20.) Sarah Jessica Parker

Parker suffered from secondary infertility, which is when you struggle to conceive after already giving birth to a child. When she was filming the movie “Did You Hear About the Morgans?”, which came out in 2009, she and her husband, Matthew Broderick, shared with the world that they were expecting twins through surrogacy. Elle magazine credits the announcement with sparking a national conversation about surrogacy: the economics and the reasoning behind it.

""I knew there would be lots of opinions about, ‘Well, why didn't you adopt? Why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that?’ and the truth of the matter is, it wasn't one or the other for us,” Parker said.

She went on to tell the magazine that she and Broderick had explored all their options. This just so happened to come first.

21.) Giuliana Rancic

Rancic’s story could fill a book -- but we’ll let the “E!” host do the talking: She penned a really poignant piece called “#LetsTalkFertility” in April 2018, in which she discusses “hundreds of shots, multiple rounds of IVF, miscarriage and heartbreak.”

She writes, “No one ever told me, ‘Oh, by the way, your eggs change when you reach a certain age.’ I definitely had misconceptions about my fertility. … Unfortunately, fertility is a topic that people don’t talk about – it makes them uncomfortable. There is still stigma and silence that is attached to fertility issues that is painful to the core. But the truth is, 1 in 8 couples in the U.S. are impacted by infertility, so it’s time we shift the cultural narrative by talking about it. Now more than ever, this feels like the right time to normalize the conversation around fertility.”

22.) Elisabeth Rohm

Getty Images

Rohm, perhaps best known for her role as Serena Southerlyn on “Law & Order,” wanted to be the one who told her story, as well. So she wrote a book called, “Baby Steps: Having the Child I Always Wanted (Just Not As I Expected).”

Here’s what she said on the topic of infertility to New York Metro Parents: “I discovered at 34 that I had fertility issues and that if I wanted to have a child I needed to do IVF pretty aggressively, which came as a shock to me. We kept it to ourselves. We only shared it with our very closest family members. But after talking to a girlfriend who was on her third miscarriage and who felt like she needed to get some help, I decided to tell her I had done IVF. There was this instant feeling of connection in telling the truth about it and this relief in being able to help her find the right doctor. We need to move the ball down the field of talking about infertility openly and not being ashamed of it, if we’re experiencing it.” Hats off, Elisabeth!

23.) Brooke Shields

After a miscarriage and undergoing several rounds of IVF to no avail, Shields tried one final round of IVF at the age of 36, according to Fertility Today. And it worked -- Shields got pregnant in 2002 and gave birth to her daughter, Rowan, in 2003. She wrote about the experience in her memoir, according to reports.

24.) Amy Smart

Getty Images

Last year, Smart took to her Instagram page to share a sweet photo of her and her daughter -- and mentioned using a surrogate to carry the baby after years of her own infertility struggles. The post is flooded with comments from well-wishers, including users saying things like, “Thank you for being open about your fertility struggles, @smarthouse26. Your honesty helps destigmatize it and helps anyone going through it feel more normal and OK. Bless you and your perfect daughter.”

25.) Trista Sutter

The “Bachelorette” alum called her two-year infertility struggle “definitely a dark time in my life,” in an article in US Weekly. She and her husband, Ryan Sutter, went on to have two children, but she detailed her struggles and the insecurities she felt while promoting her book in 2015.

26.) Chrissy Teigen

Getty Images

These days, Teigen and husband John Legend have their hands full, chasing after two kids. But it wasn't always like this.

""I will say, honestly, John and I are having trouble,"" Teigen confessed in 2015, adding that they'd seen fertility doctors. ""We would have kids five, six years ago if it'd happened. But my gosh, it's been a process! ... So, any time somebody asks me if I'm going to have kids, I'm like, 'One day, you're going to ask that to the wrong girl who's really struggling, and it's going to be really hurtful to them. And I hate that. So, I hate it. Stop asking me!'"" Tyra Banks, mentioned up top, got emotional about her own journey during the ""FABLife"" discussion, as well.

27.) Gabrielle Union

""If you happen to have issues with fertility as you've gotten older and you happen to have a career, all is not lost,"" said Union, the wife of Dwayne Wade, during a visit to ""TODAY.""

""There is so much hope, there are so many options.""

In an interview with Redbook, she said, ""So far, it has not happened for us. A lot of my friends deal with [struggles to have a baby]. There's a certain amount of shame that is placed on women who have perhaps chosen a career over starting a family younger."" She went on to say that it's important not to feel that shame.

""I don’t have children. I’m not going to have kids,"" the actress told Maria Menounos on her SiriusXM radio show. ""I went through early menopause.""

29.) Kim Kardashian West

When you’re Kardashian West, not a lot in your life is able to slide under the radar. She’s made headlines many times in recent years for her fertility. Kardashian West carried her first two children, then used a surrogate for her third baby, Chicago, and the one she and husband Kanye West are currently expecting.

Kardashian West developed placenta accreta, a condition in which the placenta doesn't detach from the wall of the womb properly, which is why she says she’s now using a carrier.

She revealed in “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” that the damage left her with a hole in her uterus that required surgery if she was to conceive again. Kardashian West underwent the surgery, but it was unsuccessful. Marie Claire reports that she said, “I can’t carry any more kids. It’s the worst. It’s not going to be happy for me. I had a full break down. I give up.”

The bubbly “Hairspray” star beat cervical cancer at the age of 27, but lost her cervix and uterus. With that, she lost the possibility of getting pregnant herself, but fortunately enough, found a surrogate she bonded with and trusted.

""The second I met her, I knew, ‘This was it. This was the woman.' Exactly six months later, we were pregnant."" Watch Winokur as she tells her story in this YouTube video from Redbook magazine.

The Facebook founder and his wife, Priscilla Chan, cut right to the chase when announcing their pregnancy on -- well, what other platform would you expect? -- Facebook (of course!)

""Priscilla and I have some exciting news: we're expecting a baby girl! ... We want to share one experience to start. We've been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way.

""You feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a child. You start imagining who they'll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they're gone. It's a lonely experience. Most people don't discuss miscarriages because you worry your problems will distance you or reflect upon you -- as if you're defective or did something to cause this. So you struggle on your own. In today's open and connected world, discussing these issues doesn't distance us; it brings us together. It creates understanding and tolerance, and it gives us hope.""

1204,"Brandy Hall detective, Vietnam veteran Sid LaDow dies at 79","CLOSE As featured on the FLORIDA TODAY podcast ""Murder on the Space Coast: Where is Brandy Hall?"" retired detective Sid LaDow has made finding the missing firefighter hiw own personal mission. Wochit

The case of missing firefighter Brandy Hall is what brought retired detective Sid LaDow and me together.

And when we started becoming good friends, I knew I wouldn't have him around for very long. In fact, I'd joke that he had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel.

It wasn't his age. It wasn't the chain smoking. It wasn't the hacking cough or the bad ticker. It was love.

Sid lost his wife Sue in late 2016 and wasn't shy about telling me that he missed her terribly and wanted to be with her again. He'd set a rose on her nightstand daily. He'd set out a cup for her coffee. He'd talk to her.

He'd tell her he loved her. He'd tell her he would be along soon. But most of the time he would talk to her about Brandy Hall, the subject of Season 3 of our Murder on the Space Coast podcast.

""I think about Brandy every day and when I pray every night. It's an everyday occurrence with me. She's never far from my thoughts,"" Sid told me last year. ""And my wife, too, when she was still alive, she would pray every single day. She was my best cheerleader. I miss her something terrible.""

Now, the old detective has made his way home.

He died on Wednesday at the age of 79 and I am selfishly heartbroken that I have lost such a close and dear friend. I will never get to see his Facebook messages pop up — that man loved using Facebook. I will never get to tease him again about wanting to meet for lunch at 11 in the morning; who eats lunch at that time? I'll never be able to get on him about his smoking — he'd quip that the long coughing spells clear out his lungs. I'll never hear him talk about Bonnie and Clyde again, his two Shetland sheep dogs I took for a week last year while he was hospitalized.

I never told him they were afraid of walking on my concrete patio to get to the backyard and so they made my living room their personal toilet. I never knew such small dogs could go so much.

Earlier this month he told me he paid $125 to get his hearing aid fixed and that now he ""could hear a gnat fart at 200 yards!""

He also told me that quitting smoking was easy. ""I've done it about 5,000 times,"" he'd laugh.

I'll miss the old detective, and I know I'm not alone. As soon as I found out he had passed, the texts, messages and calls started and haven't stopped. How do you pay tribute to such an incredible man? A man who exemplified what a law enforcement officer should be? A man who was a true champion for justice in addition to being a great friend?

I wanted to write the best thing I've ever written to honor him. But it's tough writing with tears in my eyes and this pain in my heart.

So, here goes my friend. This one's for you.

Sid LaDow, was larger than life. I know we throw that phrase around way too often but in Sid's case it was true. He was like a character from a John Grisham novel. He was a combination of Robert Mitchum and Peter Falk.

He spoke in this slow mid-west country drawl and would look you dead in the eye when he did. He grew up on a farm in a tiny Illinois town called Pleasant Hill in Pike County close to the Missouri border and he'd reminisce about sitting on the main drag watching cars go by as a kid.

When duty called Sid responded bravely for the country he loved. He proudly served in Vietnam where he was part of the the U.S Army 1st Cavalry Division. He commanded the ""A"" Company 27th Maintenance Battalion in support of the 1st Brigade. He would retire a Major.

After the war he wasn't sure what he wanted to do. He found himself in Florida and in his own words ""fiddled around.""

""After a while I said 'maybe I can be a cop,'"" he told me. ""So, I went around to the academy and I applied at Palm Bay and fortunately I was hired.""

Now, according to Sid, the chief of police at the time didn't have money for new uniforms. ""So, he said go on back to detectives till I get some money. He never got the money and I stayed back there for almost 20 years. So, that's how I got started in it. I was very lucky back there. I was solving some crimes and making some arrests.""

He would later return to military duty in advance of the first Gulf War and recently told me about helping plan logistics and supplies in event of war during that time. But his real heroics came doing police work.

There was a serial rapist he helped bring to justice as well as other high profile cases he worked before he retired in 1995. But it always bothered him that he hadn't solved Ed Smith's disappearance. Smith had last been seen in 1988 and his family and the police feared foul play.

It's no surprise that 10 years after retiring from the force, when I started writing about Ed Smith, Sid was back working the case for free along with his buddy (and mine) Tom Davis with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

When I asked him why, he told me that he owed it to Ed Smith’s family and besides, he added, it was a chance to get back in the saddle again. Davis had promised Smith's daughter they would solve it and they did.

Davis texted me after learning of Sid's passing.

""Loved the old warrior,"" he wrote.

""I did too,"" was my response.

Years after the Smith case, Sid would call again. He wanted to shake things up in the investigation of a missing firefighter. This time he was asked by the Palm Bay Police to investigate along with another retired law enforcement officer Carroll ""Doc"" Jones.

It would become Sid's great obsession and he would spend roughly the last decade of his life fighting for justice and searching for a woman he never met, Brandy Hall. He — along with Doc Jones — would interview dozens of people, write in-depth reports, authorize polygraph tests, conduct searches and much more.

He said he owed it to Brandy's parents, her children and husband to keep working. That's the kind of person he was.

Earlier this year, private investigator Nic Sandberg and I helped Sid hang more ""Brandy Hall: Still Missing"" signs all over the Grant Seafood Festival. He'd always done it himself but his health was declining rapidly.

""I’m gonna live long enough even though I’ve got some serious problems,"" he'd say. ""I’m gonna live long enough to get her back.""

Brown, Michael R. Brown)

And just earlier this month, the old detective and I found ourselves back at the pond where Brandy's truck was found the afternoon she went missing in 2006. He had to stop to catch his breath twice while walking into the wooded area.

Something happened at the pond that really captures who Sid LaDow was.

We came across new tools, children's toys, power tools, DVDs, GPS and more. I didn't know what to make of it but Sid instinctively knew that someone had stolen a vehicle and dumped everything from the vehicle right there in that spot. He noticed a handful of the same business card and wound up calling. Sure enough the person was relieved to get their tools and other personal belongings back.

Sid was thoughtful.

He would send Facebook messages to my wife and daughter just to say hello or to share something about his dogs, which he always called pups.

For my birthday last year he made me a batch of homemade hooch he called ""Old Gag and Puke."" It was like a cross between NyQuil and gasoline. I only wish I had saved some to drink in his honor tonight.

Slowly over the last year and more rapidly in recent months, Sid unofficially passed the investigation over to Sandberg, who is tenaciously working the case for free for Brandy's mother, Debbie Rogge.

I think it was Sid's confidence that the investigation would continue and that the baton would remain in capable hands that allowed him to stop fighting the pain and the suffering and close his eyes one last time.

""Now he knows where Brandy is,"" Rogge said, after telling me how much Sid meant to her. ""Maybe he can lead us to her.""

Sid leaves behind two sons, a daughter, five grandchildren and four great grandchildren — one of whom was born this month. We had one of those 11 a.m. lunches last week at Sonny's and he couldn't stop talking about the latest addition to his clan.

I have no doubt the Brandy Hall case will be solved. And when it does, I'll pour myself my own version of ""Old Gag and Puke"" and toast my buddy, knowing his work helped lead us to her.

And knowing he is home. God bless you Sid. Thanks for being my friend.

1206,Lake County moving forward with Groveland Four monument,"TAVARES – The Lake County Commission is moving forward with a Groveland Four monument.

On Tuesday, the commission agreed on the style and preliminary wording for the memorial, which will detail the tragic saga of the four black Lake County men who were accused of raping a white woman in 1949.

The men – Earnest Thomas, Charles Greenlee, Sammy Shepherd and Walter Irvin – received a full posthumous pardon from Gov. Ron DeSantis in January.

Board chairwoman Leslie Campione said the 350-word text will not only tell their stories, but also send a message.

“Today, this is not something we would ever stand for in our county,” she said during the commission meeting. “We believe in fairness and compassion and equal protection under the law for all of our residents and citizens.”

The commission will get feedback from the victims’ families before finalizing the design and wording. Campione said she thought the families would be “very pleased” with it. Commissioner Wendy Breeden asked county staff also to look into including etchings of each of the men on the monument.

When it’s finished, it will sit in front of the Lake County Historical Museum, the county’s former courthouse, which once housed the office of the infamous then-Sheriff Willis McCall.

The proposed monument text lambasts McCall for the “lack of evidence against the men, manufactured evidence, witness perjury and systemic racism.”

It begins with a sentence about the Jan. 11 pardon, followed by the details of the case.

“Eyewitness accounts, records, and subsequent investigations revealed that these men were subjected to racially motivated oppression and were never given the chance to legitimately defend themselves in a court of law,” it says.

It gives credit to the players who supported the pardon, including authors Gary Corsair and Gilbert King, who wrote books about the cases, the commission, the City of Groveland, the Florida Legislature and the county’s constitutional officers and residents.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190425/lake-county-moving-forward-with-groveland-four-monument?rssfeed=true,2019-04-25T05:05:00Z,Daily Commercial,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA",FL,34748

A woman who lives in Jupiter Farms says she sees all kinds of wildlife, but when she found a frog with half of its face missing, she turned to social media.It's just one of the many perks of living out in Jupiter Farms. ""We actually have had bobcats in the yard, a lot of hawks, egrets, cranes, big bird population, turtles, alligators,” says Amy Carden, who lives in Jupiter Farms.But when Carden found the first half-faced amphibian about a month ago, it was a little alarming. ""We found a toad, sitting in one of the rocks, looked like a rock, and it had half a face, same thing half of a face, like most of the mouth was gone,” says Carden.And then it happened again on Saturday, when she found this guy swimming around her guest toilet bowl.""Does not have half of its face again. That is two here, we've never seen anything like it,” says Carden.She posted a picture on Facebook which got several people guessing what they thought was wrong with the frog.

University of Florida football assistant director of player personnel Otis Yelverton has been placed on leave by the school following his arrest Monday on aggravated stalking.

Yelverton, 51, is facing a charge of aggravated cyberstalking, which is a third-degree felony, according to court records. He was arrested at UF by the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office because he was deemed a credible threat to a person, according to court records.

Yelverton is in the Alachua County jail, and no bond has been set.

According to an arrest report, Yelverton harassed his former girlfriend after she ended their yearlong relationship on April 14. Yelverton is accused of calling, text messaging and Facebook messaging the woman 40 times.

On April 21, Yelverton left a threatening voicemail stating he would “blow up” her vehicle, according to court records.

Text messages used “multiple vulgarities and demeaning language,” which placed the woman in a state of fear, according to Sheriff's Office.

She told deputies she asked Yelverton to cease contact, believing he could physically attack her.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190423/uf-football-staffer-on-leave-after-stalking-arrest?rssfeed=true,2019-04-23T21:48:18Z,Gainesville Sun,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA",FL,32608

1213,Chemical reaction causes yellow cloud to form in Palm Beach Country Estates,"Authorities converged on a remote area in Palm Beach Country Estates after reports of a yellow cloud and possible explosion Tuesday.

Palm Beach County Fire Rescue responded to an incident involving acid near the intersection of 154th Court North and 89th Avenue North.

Fire officials say workers were doing routine maintenance on a well owned by the Town of Jupiter in a vacant lot.

The head of the well failed and when the head failed, this caused hydrochloric acid and water to shoot up out of the well into the surrounding dirt.

Some hydrochloric acid also got into the nearby C-18 canal, but an official said it has dissipated and is not a concern and he said the drinking water supply is safe and was not affected.

No one was evacuated, nobody was injured.

""I'm just concerned about the Sandhill cranes that are around and they have little chickens and I hope that doesn't affect them because wildlife here is very appreciated,"" said Maria Bueno, a woman who lives nearby.

Palm Beach County Fire Rescue says they used a chemical to neutralize the acid that spilled onto the ground. Workers in protective yellow hazardous material suits could be seen walking around the site and some dirt was also removed around the well.

Officials say the yellow cloud that some residents reported has dissipated and was not an issue.

A Fire-Rescue spokesman said he did not have any information about a possible explosion.

A resident told CBS12 News he heard an explosion that sounded like a electrical transformer blowing up.

The South Florida Water Management District and Florida Department of Environmental Protection were also notified.",http://cw34.com/news/local/chemical-reaction-causes-yellow-cloud-to-form-near-jupiter-farms,2019-04-23T19:05:05Z,WTVX,"1100 Fairfield Dr, West Palm Beach, FL 33407, USA",FL,33407
1216,Masseuse alleged to have performed sex acts on Robert Kraft arrested,"Police say Mingbi Shen is one of two women secretly recorded performing sex acts on New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter.

JUPITER, Fla. - A woman arrested on several prostitution charges is alleged to have given New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft more than just a massage during one of his visits to a Jupiter day spa earlier this year.

Mingbi Shen, 58, of Flushing, New York, faces one count of deriving support from prostitution and eight counts of offering to commit prostitution stemming from the Orchids of Asia Day Spa investigation.

According to a Jupiter police affidavit, Shen was one of two women secretly recorded performing sex acts on Kraft during a Jan. 19 visit to the spa.

Shen and co-defendant Lei Wang, 45, ""both began massaging Kraft,"" Detective Andrew Sharp wrote in the affidavit.

Sharp describes how Shen can be seen ""manipulating Kraft's penis"" and later wiping it with a towel. The affidavit goes on to say how Kraft handed Wang and Shen cash before they finished dressing him.

The alleged incident took place on the eve of New England's 37-31 overtime win against the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship game.

Jupiter Police Chief Daniel Kerr has said Kraft also visited the business the next morning.

Kraft purchased the Patriots in 1994. Under his ownership, the Patriots have won six Super Bowls, including this year's 13-3 victory against the Los Angeles Rams, and 10 AFC titles.

Kraft's attorneys have been fighting to prevent the release of video, arguing that police obtained it illegally.

A Palm Beach County judge ruled Tuesday that surveillance video from the day spa should not immediately be made public so as not to jeopardize Kraft's ""fundamental right to a fair and impartial jury.""

However, Judge Leonard Hanser said the video can be released once a trial jury has been sworn in, a plea agreement has been reached or the state ceases to pursue charges against Kraft.

1217,"Central Florida Easter bunny brawler seen in viral video is fugitive with violent past, police say","Antoine McDonald has gained national notoriety for fighting in an Easter Bunny costume in Orlando. He's also wanted in New Jersey and has a history of armed robbery.

A bar hopping bunny who claimed he was defending a woman when cameras caught him in a downtown Orlando brawl Easter Sunday may not be so innocent.

Turns out, the man in the suit — 20-year-old Antoine McDonald — is wanted in New Jersey in connection with a vehicle burglary last fall. He was also recently a “person of interest” in a carjacking and two armed robberies in Pasco County, according to the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office.

McDonald could have relished in anonymity, his face and identity hidden by the pink nose and tall ears of the bunny costume. But after the video went viral, McDonald spoke to multiple media outlets, including TMZ and Orlando’s WKMG. He even created the Instagram profile, badbunnyof19.

He said he’s not a violent person.

A post shared by Underground Public House (@ugphorlando) on Apr 22, 2019 at 7:30am PDT

“I am the type of person to avoid fights by any means necessary, but in that situation, I would fight any day,” he told WKMG.

McDonald said he and a few friends were out for a Sunday Funday. It being Easter, they made the obvious choice to hit the bars while taking turns wearing a bunny costume. As they neared SAK Comedy Lab on South Orange Avenue, McDonald hopped to action.

“I saw him spit on her and then I saw, you know like a fight break out,” he told TMZ. “I just ran over there.”

McDonald said he ran over, not even thinking that he was still in the suit, with hopes of breaking up the fight. But when that led to the man getting on top of the woman, he started laying into the man with a few literal rabbit punches.

The fight was quickly broken up by Orlando Police, but no arrests were made.

Posts on the new Instagram page espouse messages of heroism and helping those in need. Criminal records from at least three states, however, tell a different story of the man beneath the ears.

According to police in Dover, Del., McDonald was arrested in early 2017 after he and two others were accused of committing two armed robberies in a span of 12 hours on New Year’s Day.

McDonald was charged with two counts of robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, second-degree conspiracy and tampering with physical evidence.

Police said he and his accomplices robbed three people by gunpoint, hitting one with the gun and punching another, then robbed two more people by gunpoint before fleeing in a red SUV police said McDonald owned.

In September 2018, police in South Brunswick, N.J., said McDonald and an accomplice were caught on surveillance cameras breaking into, and burglarizing, a car. The township’s police charged McDonald in the crime and issued a warrant for his arrest, but said they believed he fled the state. Police in New Jersey said McDonald burglarized two cars claiming the owners owed him money, but were unable to connect him to the owners.

South Brunswick Deputy Police Chief Jim Ryan said McDonald was also arrested in 2018 for harassing a man through social media and harassment for spitting at a 7-Eleven employee. He was also implicated in a basketball court assault that didn’t lead to an arrest.

“He’s got a lot of entries last year,” Ryan said.

A few months after the burglary warrant was issued, in January 2019, McDonald turned up in Pasco County jail after he was arrested on a charge of using a fake ID. According to deputies, McDonald used the ID to rent a U-Haul. At the time of the Pasco arrest, authorities were looking for McDonald in connection with a carjacking and two armed robberies, but he has yet to be charged.

Pasco jail records show him having a Zephyrhills address. He also told police in New Jersey he lived in Tampa and claims to have recently moved to Orlando.

One month later, in February, he was arrested on a charge of reckless driving by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office.

Two months after that arrest, he gained national attention for unleashing a flurry of furry fists to defend a stranger and, just a few months after fleeing to the state, reached peak Florida.

1219,Plastic surgery nightmare: 13 women seeking discount died at clinics opened by felons,"MIAMI – One man pleaded guilty to bank fraud. One was convicted of grand theft in a real estate scam. Two others admitted to elaborate Medicare schemes that siphoned millions from taxpayers.

In Florida, one of the nation’s top destinations for plastic surgery, a felony conviction can bar someone from operating a massage parlor or a pawn shop.

But not from running a cosmetic surgery clinic.

Nearly a dozen miles from the iconic beaches of South Florida, the four convicted felons ran facilities that became assembly lines for patients from across the country seeking the latest body sculpting procedures at discount prices.

And at those businesses, at least 13 women have died after surgeries. Nearly a dozen others were hospitalized with critical injuries, including punctured internal organs.

The state health department was alerted to the casualties. Government inspectors cited the clinics for serious violations, including dirty operating rooms and sales agents with no medical licenses determining the appropriate surgeries for patients.

Plastic surgery experts warned lawmakers to take control of the centers by screening owners and boosting regulation.

Four times, legislators tried. Four times they failed to muster enough support to change the law, even as the toll at the four businesses continued to rise: two dead in 2013, no action; another dead in 2015, no action; three dead in 2017, still no action.

""It's absolutely incredible,"" said Dr. Grant Stevens, a clinical professor of surgery and president of the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. ""Government is supposed to protect the health and welfare of its citizens.""

Discount surgery centers founded by felons leave two women scarred Porche Campbell and Nicola Mason discuss the aftermath of visiting Spectrum Aesthetics, a clinic in the Miami area founded by two partners who had been convicted in a Medicare fraud case. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY

At Seduction by Jardon, a 31-year-old woman nearly bled to death and went into kidney failure as she languished in a back room for six hours before her mother found her, hospital records and a state complaint show.

At New Life Plastic Surgery and Strax Rejuvenation, women died after their doctors injected fat into their muscles in a popular procedure known as the Brazilian butt lift. Medical experts who reviewed autopsies for USA TODAY said the fat was injected too deep and collected in their lungs, killing them.

One woman, who left Spectrum Aesthetics with a stray surgical sponge sewn into her abdomen, said she would have canceled her tummy tuck if she had known the operators had been convicted of defrauding Medicare of $1 million.

A manager of the clinic, Evelyn Parrado, was granted permission to run the cosmetic surgery center during the day while spending her nights under house arrest on the felony charge.

""Why is that allowed to be legal?"" said Porche Campbell, the 40-year-old mother who needed emergency surgery to take out the sponge and, later, reconstructive surgery to get rid of the scar. ""How can I trust them to keep me safe?""

Most of the women who died – 10 in all – were African-American or Hispanic, ethnic groups frequently targeted in the clinics’ advertising campaigns.

Representatives of three of the clinics – Spectrum, Strax and New Life – told USA TODAY that criminal histories have no bearing on the way the centers are run and that their facilities meet all state safety requirements to carry out procedures.

Jeffry Davis, a co-founder of Strax Rejuvenation, pointed out that his convictions on federal bank fraud and tax evasion were nearly a quarter-century ago, in 1995.

""I personally don't see how that would affect anybody's feeling of my integrity today,"" he said.

The president of Seduction declined to answer written questions about the business or the involvement of her husband, who was convicted in a mortgage fraud case.

The role of clinic operators varies greatly but can include hiring doctors, ordering drugs, scheduling surgeries, and overseeing risk management to cut down on deaths and injuries.

Health care experts say a criminal history – especially a conviction for financial crimes – is among the most important factors in deciding who should be allowed to run a center.

Clinic operators are expected to follow a litany of health regulations that require them to put safety over profit, said Michael Gonzalez, an Ohio lawyer who advises medical institutions on hiring practices. With felons, he said, “you have people with a propensity"" to break the law.

Florida legislators in Tallahassee are back this year with another proposal that would give the state the power for the first time to shut down clinics and impose other punishments.

The bill was introduced by Sen. Anitere Flores in February, days after a USA TODAY and Naples Daily News investigation revealed dangerous practices in a Miami-area plastic surgery business where eight women died after operations and nearly a dozen were hospitalized.

People are coming here from all over the country for what should have been simple procedures, and they're dying. We don't want to be known as a place where people come to die. Sen. Anitere Flores

""People are coming here from all over the country for what should have been simple procedures, and they're dying,” said Flores, a Republican whose district includes the state’s cosmetic surgery hub in the suburbs of Miami. “We don't want to be known as a place where people come to die.""

The proposal has gone further than previous bills, clearing three Senate committees and two House panels – all unanimously. Yet critics continue to question whether a legislature historically opposed to regulation will support the crackdown.

They point out that even as lawmakers turned down past attempts at stricter oversight, they approved millions to promote Florida as a destination for medical tourism, with plastic surgery as one of its big draws. In 2014, the state allocated the first $5 million to that marketing campaign.

Nicola Mason, a Maryland woman with deep, jagged scars along her lower stomach that she blames on an operation at Spectrum in 2015, wonders why it has taken so long for the state to act.

“It’s outrageous,” she said. “They should have thought about this six or seven deaths ago.”

Packed waiting rooms, busy surgical suites

At Strax Rejuvenation near Fort Lauderdale, surgeries turned deadly nearly every year.

A 64-year-old woman was given lethal doses of opioids by her doctor during a face lift in 2008, a state malpractice probe found. Another woman died three years later after a neck lift during which her doctor gave her a dangerous mix of sedatives and then failed to monitor her, state investigators reported.

Eight deaths in eight years, according to autopsy and state records. None of them made a difference.

Florida legislators passed laws decades ago that allowed the state to discipline doctors who owned clinics and practiced there. They never envisioned that private investors would jump into the industry, too.

There is a gap. No one anticipated that non-physicians would take over clinics and be largely immune to these good laws. Christopher Nuland, a health care lawyer

That loophole means people without medical degrees can own clinics that break state laws with little chance of being shut down, even if they leave patients dead.

""There is a gap,"" said Christopher Nuland, a health care lawyer who helped write the first legislation in 2000. ""No one anticipated that non-physicians would take over clinics and be largely immune to these good laws.""

In the end, the operators who benefited most from the discount clinics faced no repercussions.

One of those clinics was Strax, which opened in 2004 and became the first of the large, high-volume clinics that can create unique risks for patients.

By paying doctors strictly on commission and offering cut-rate prices, the clinics often operate with packed waiting rooms and busy surgical suites, and at times leave patients to fend for themselves after procedures.

State inspectors have cited Strax’s two clinics more than 45 times in the past six years for violations that included dirty operating areas, cracked and worn equipment, and no records to show doctors examined patients to clear them for surgeries.

Davis, Strax’s manager, defends the model. He says the physicians control how many surgeries they do each day and the facility’s medical director makes sure patients are safe for their procedures.

“The Department of Health, if there was something (wrong), would be sending correspondence,” Davis said.

But records show about half the doctors who have worked at Strax – 11 total – have been disciplined by medical boards during their careers for charges that included unethical conduct and malpractice in death and injury cases.

After facing 18 negligence and malpractice claims by patients – with awards and settlements in eight cases totaling $1.5 million – Strax's parent company filed for bankruptcy in 2013.

Through all of it, the clinic never shut its doors.

By Melanie Payne, Fort Myers News-Press For Dr. Christina Thompson, the cosmetic surgery that resulted in her death wasn’t her first with Strax Rejuvenation near Fort Lauderdale. She’d undergone breast reduction surgery at the clinic. So, when she decided to get a Brazilian butt lift, she chose Strax again. Her son, Daryl Thompson, said he didn’t know his mother had booked a procedure until she arrived in Florida from the Bahamas where she lived with his adult brother. “From what I heard they [Strax] do a lot of the advertisements in the Bahamas,” said Thompson, who lives in South Florida. And because she had had surgery at Strax before, ""she trusted them."" His 54-year-old mother had worked as a lab technician in Nassau for years before getting her medical degree with a specialty in surgery while raising her two sons. She was working as a general practice physician in late July 2015 when she traveled to Florida for her second surgery. “She said she wanted to do this procedure. And I said, ‘Are you sure? Because, I mean, I could understand the breast reduction, but I don’t understand what else you want to do. I don’t see the need for it,’ ” Thompson said. “But she said she wanted to do it. And once she has her mind set on something, she does it.” Thompson said he had just taken a second job and couldn’t get time off, so his then-girlfriend drove his mom to a Strax surgery office in Lauderhill. Hours later, Thompson was at work when his girlfriend called to say she was nervous because it seemed his mother had been in surgery too long. The next call was to tell him his mother was being rushed in an ambulance to a hospital. According to the Broward County medical examiner's investigative report, Christina Thompson’s heart stopped twice at the hospital and she was resuscitated. The third time, her heart stopped for good. The autopsy showed Thompson died from multiple clots of fat blocking the primary blood vessels in her lungs: a fat embolism. Mark Leibowitz, an attorney for Dr. Christopher Kelly, Thompson's surgeon at Strax, said his client did nothing wrong. ""You had a sophisticated patient who fully understood the risk she was taking,"" Leibowitz said. ""There was no indication in the autopsy report that any part of the procedure was done improperly,"" he added. ""It's a dangerous procedure."" However, three board certified plastic surgeons who reviewed the autopsy for USA TODAY said the fat embolism that led to her death is caused when a surgeon injects fat too deep in the muscle, veins are torn, and the fat seeps into the bloodstream. Medical studies have been published nearly every year since 2015 documenting the dangers of doctors injecting fat too deep into that danger zone. The Florida medical board is now considering adopting an unprecedented standard of care rule that would ban doctors from injecting fat too deep during butt lifts, said Christopher Nuland, attorney for the Florida Society of Plastic Surgeons. Records show Kelly is a board-certified plastic surgeon and graduate of the University of Iowa Medical School. Kelly voluntarily withdrew his license to practice in October 2018. In an email, the Florida Department of Health wrote that there were no public complaints or discipline associated with his license and that he can ask to return to an active status at any time. Thompson filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Kelly and Strax in June 2016, but the attorneys for the family withdrew from the case and it was voluntarily dismissed 11 months later.

By 2014, state Sen. Eleanor Sobel began meeting with the Florida Society of Plastic Surgeons, which had complained about Strax and similar clinics cropping up in South Florida.

Sobel, a Democrat, proposed a bill to allow the state to shutter the worst offenders and screen owners for criminal backgrounds, giving Florida the option of barring ex-offenders from running clinics.

To Sobel, the legislation ""was all about saving lives.""

The Senate backed the legislation, but it failed to win support in a crucial House subcommittee. Jason Brodeur, former GOP lawmaker and chairman of the panel, told USA TODAY he didn't recall the bill or why it failed.

""It could be that it was more (pertinent) to Broward or Miami-Dade than it was to the rest of the state,"" Brodeur said.

Spectrum Aesthetics in Miami kept a doctor on staff who already was under investigation by the state health department for critically injuring two patients at the clinic. Judy S. Reich for USA TODAY

That same year, state agents inspected Strax and cited it for serious violations, including medical records that were incomplete – nonexistent in some cases – and staff members failing to show they regularly monitored patients under anesthesia.

The following year, Sobel resurrected the bill with one of the Senate’s most influential GOP leaders, Don Gaetz, as co-sponsor. In a repeat of 2014, the same subcommittee killed it.

Not long after, a series of critical medical mistakes in another felon-run clinic would leave several women hospitalized, one in a coma for 28 days.

Fueled by star power

Juan Hernandez, co-founder of Spectrum Aesthetics Miami-Dade Police Department

Driven by social media ad blitzes and telemarketers, the clinics continued to grow. They rode the popularity of a new body-sculpting procedure, promoted by rap singers and reality show stars like Kim Kardashian: the Brazilian butt lift.

One of the facilities that capitalized on the trend was Spectrum Aesthetics, founded by Juan Hernandez and Evelyn Parrado in 2012, two years before Florida's first attempt to screen owners.

The duo used to run a pharmacy in Miami's Little Havana and took part in a scheme to falsely bill Medicare $1.2 million for drugs that were not legitimately prescribed and then keep the money, prosecutors charged.

The two partners closed their drug store in 2013 and moved some proceeds from the business into their cosmetic surgery center, one of their lawyers disclosed in court.

Before Hernandez began serving a 15-month prison term, he was granted permission to keep running Spectrum while on supervised release. His lawyer told the judge it was a regulated business “staffed by board-certified plastic surgeons.""

Records show that was not the case.

The clinic had hired several doctors not certified in plastic surgery, including Osakatukei Omulepu, who had failed his board exams three times.

In 2015, Omulepu carried out operations at the clinic that led to devastating injuries. On one day in May, Omulepu punctured a woman’s liver five times and perforated the small intestine of another patient in several places while performing butt lifts.

Donna McRae, 35, a mother from Michigan, was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, and Nyosha Fowler, 34, a mother of two from Alabama, was in a coma for nearly a month before regaining consciousness, state malpractice records and interviews show.

""It's the most excruciating pain I've ever been through,"" said McRae, a licensed practical nurse. ""I had to learn to walk all over again.""

Despite the state launching a malpractice investigation and a local hospital stripping Omulepu of his privileges, Spectrum continued to allow him to carry out surgeries for months, state health records show.

In September, Nicola Mason, the 46-year-old Maryland woman, alleged in a complaint to the health department that Omulepu performed the wrong surgery on her – a tummy tuck instead of a butt lift – leaving her with unsightly scars.

Parrado, the company’s manager, did not respond to questions submitted to the clinic's attorney. Hernandez declined to comment, saying he was not connected to the clinic anymore.

Instead, the clinic provided a prepared statement, saying it has been “delivering the highest standards of care to thousands of patients” for many years and the doctors connected to the injuries are no longer working for the facility.

Omulepu told USA TODAY the two women who suffered perforated organs were the ""only serious complications of my career.""

However, two years later, while working at a competing clinic, Seduction Cosmetic Center, a patient died after surgery by Omulepu. The cause of her death: fat embolism.

Medical experts say the only way such an embolism occurs is when a doctor injects the fat into areas they are warned to avoid: the deep gluteal muscles. Omulepu says the surgery brings high risks and he regrets what happened in the operating room that day.

“Is it tragic? Absolutely,” he said. “Do I wish it didn’t happen? Absolutely.”

As to Mason’s claim that he performed the wrong surgery, Omulepu flatly denied the allegation, saying he would never do a procedure without the patient’s consent. ""That's assault and battery,"" he said.

He said Mason initially signed up for a butt lift, but when he examined her, he determined she was not a good candidate and they agreed she would get a tummy tuck instead, his surgery records show.

At the urging of the Florida Society of Plastic Surgeons, Sobel stepped forward with yet another bill in 2016, asking lawmakers to require background checks on owners. This time the bill was especially harsh on felony offenders: They would be automatically banned.

That proposal not only failed to draw a House sponsor, but it died in Sobel’s own health committee.

“Over-regulation, they tell people,” she said. ""They use that as an excuse even when people die.""

Ultimately, the medical board revoked Omulepu’s license in 2017 over the cases of the punctured organs. He fought the charges in a state appeals court and temporarily won back the right to practice.

He returned to work and five weeks later, performed the surgery at Seduction that led to the patient’s death by fat embolism. He lost his license again and is no longer practicing.

Kidney failure and shock

The fatal surgery at Seduction drew the attention of the Florida health department. State agents reviewed the operation, and the medical examiner investigated the death.

But what caught Crystal Call’s eye was the company's elegant website and its promises of life-changing surgery at low prices.

Call, then 31, worked for the New York State Bridge Authority. She knew a butt lift would be far more expensive if performed by a board-certified surgeon closer to home. What she didn’t know was the man who managed the clinic had been charged in a mortgage scam years earlier.

Crystal Call credits her mother, Maria Basham, with saving her life after surgery at a Seduction clinic in 2017. ""One more hour, she would have been dead,"" Basham said. Courtesy of Maria Basham

Rayner Aguiar, 36, took over the center in Aventura after he was convicted of falsifying paperwork to inflate the value of a home in 2008. The clinic is one of four run by Seduction, where Aguiar’s wife, Gretel Jardon, is president of the family business.

Aguiar did not respond to interview requests. Jardon would say only that clinics run by doctors are more dangerous but offered no proof.

Call said she became concerned the day she arrived for her examination to find a crowded waiting room, with patients walking through the lobby in their gowns after surgery.

""It was crazy to see the amount of people coming out in one day,"" she said.

Then Call said she learned from her doctor that she would be among 11 surgeries the next day. But ""he said, 'Don't worry. You're the first one in,' '' she recalled.

With her mother outside in the waiting room, Call went into surgery at about 9 a.m. Hours later, Call’s mother got worried.

""I'm waiting and waiting,"" Maria Basham said.

By evening, Basham asked to see her daughter. When a staff member said she would have to continue to wait, Basham said she rushed to the rear of the clinic and started ""banging on doors.""

""They had a lock on the door in the recovery (room),"" she said.

Basham remembers dialing 911 and then being allowed into a back room, where she found Call in a bed, pale and unresponsive. A former nursing student, she said she was stunned to see her daughter's blood pressure had plummeted.

""In an hour, she would have been dead,"" she said.

An ambulance rushed Call to Aventura Hospital. They found her in the throes of kidney failure and shock, hospital records state, and in need of an emergency transfusion.

Over the next several days, she received steady doses of painkillers and antibiotics.

After returning to New York, Call was treated for numbness and other complications that have consumed her life ever since, she said. When she returned to her job four weeks later, she was assigned to desk duty at the Bridge Authority.

Call said she has difficulty walking longer than five minutes and can no longer run. She said her stomach is covered with deep and unsightly scars from the surgery. After two years of treatments, she said she owes about $156,000 in medical bills.

“It’s ruined my life right now,” she said.

Call filed a complaint with the state but said has not heard back in at least a year. She said calling the clinic seemed pointless.

""They know the risks and they know they're not going to face any consequences,"" she said. ""It's sad.""

Legislative fix on fast track

Members of the powerful Senate health committee considering the most recent reform proposal last month sat quietly in the darkness as a video played on a large screen in the hearing room.

With tears in her eyes, a middle-aged mother recalled the daughter who had dreamed of someday being a nurse. Instead, Adianet Galván died last year of a fat embolism after a Brazilian butt lift at New Life Plastic Surgery, autopsy records show.

""I never thought my daughter would come to this country and die at the age of 30,"" said Arelys Gonzalez, a native of Cuba.

For the fifth time, the legislature has taken up a bill to rein in clinics. Sen. Flores is taking no chances, making sure her colleagues understand the stakes.

What wasn’t disclosed to the lawmakers at the video session was that the man who founded New Life was another felon: Santiago Borges, who years earlier had concocted a $70 million Medicare scam.

The 54-year-old businessman drove a Mercedes-Benz 500 and a BMW 7 series, collected Rolex GMT-Master watches and owned boats in Mexico and Key Biscayne. When he was arrested, he used the proceeds from his cosmetic surgery clinic to pay his bail, court records show.

Santiago Borges, co-founder of New Life Plastic Surgery Miami-Dade Police Department

After he was sentenced in 2015 to a term later reduced to eight years, his daughter, Claudia, became an owner of the clinic. In a written statement to USA TODAY, Claudia Borges and co-owner, Daniel Gonzalez, said that Santiago Borges no longer oversees the clinic.

They said the facility ""puts patient care and safety first and is continually working to improve patient care."" It supports any regulations ""that would improve quality of care and patient safety.""

Since 2014, the clinic has failed to meet safety standards in every annual state inspection. Among the violations: missing medical records and patients paying for surgeries before they see a doctor. Plans of correction were filed by the clinic each year.

Flores, who learned about the existence of former criminals in the industry from USA TODAY earlier this month, said she hoped the revelations would help her persuade fellow lawmakers to approve her proposal.

Veterans of the legislature say even deaths may not be enough. For years, the state’s political body has resisted new regulations in health care facilities, even after deaths and injuries in assisted-living facilities.

When a House member stepped forward last year to propose yet another bill to screen operators of all surgery offices – the fourth attempt – it didn’t survive its first committee.

Already, the bill being considered has been softened. Lawmakers removed a mandate that the state screen all plastic surgery center owners for criminal records because of concerns over the cost of carrying out the checks.

It’s unconscionable. How the heck can you leave the lives of patients to a medical clinic that is run by convicted felons? Dr. Grant Stevens, a clinical professor of surgery and president of the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery

Stevens, the president of the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, said he was perplexed at the past legislative failures given the number of deaths and injuries in the four facilities.

“It’s unconscionable,” said Stevens, a former member of the California Medical Board's medical review committee. ""How the heck can you leave the lives of patients to a medical clinic that is run by convicted felons?”

If lawmakers “fail to step in and help” again, he added, “then, I’m sorry, they have the blood on their collective hands.""

1220,Lake County moves forward with Groveland Four monument,"TAVARES, Fla. - Lake County officials decided to move forward with a plan to build a monument-style plaque for the Groveland Four.

A meeting was held Tuesday to discuss the memorial, which would be located at the historic courthouse in Tavares.

Earnest Thomas, Charles Greenlee, Samuel Shepard and Walter Irvin -- the so-called Groveland Four -- are all dead.

Earlier this year, Gov. Ron DeSantis pardoned the four African-American men, 70 years after they were falsely accused of raping a 17-year-old white woman in Lake County.

""We felt it was appropriate to use that as a chance to tell the story and honor the people that were the victims in this situation and make a firm statement that this is a thing in the past and this is not Lake County today,"" Lake County Board Chairman Leslie Campione said.

Officials will gather feedback from families and find a company to construct the monument, a proposal of which can be seen below.

1222,Longtime administrator named provost at Florida SouthWestern State College,"CLOSE Five women accused ex-FSW Provost Jeff Stewart of sexual misconduct in 2018. Thyrie Bland, tbland@news-press.com

A longtime administrator and former professor at Florida SouthWestern State College has been named the school's new provost.

Eileen DeLuca began her career at FSW in 2005 as an adjunct professor. She worked her way up the career ladder, reaching the position of associate vice president in 2015.

DeLuca replaces former Provost Jeffrey Stewart, who stepped down last year. Five women, including four FSW employees and a student, accused Stewart of sexual misconduct, according to a 15-page report the school authored.

DeLuca, who was named FSW's interim provost after Stewart resigned, was among more than 80 candidates to apply for the job. A search committee narrowed the pool of candidates to seven semifinalists and then three finalists.

FSW: Former provost accused of sexual misconduct

DeLuca said she has received many messages of congratulations since a note was sent out late Friday afternoon announcing her selection as provost.

""I am so humbled by the amount of people who have expressed congratulations and just support,"" DeLuca said. ""I think that's one of the great things about working here is that across all offices we really support each other.""

The provost is FSW's chief academic officer. FSW has more than 22,000 students and campuses in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties.

DeLuca beat out Donald Painter, dean of academic success at Polk State College in Winter Haven, and Scott Behrens, vice president for teaching and learning at Northwest Florida State College in Niceville, for the job. Her salary as provost is $195,000.

""I have got full faith and confidence in the process that we undertook as well as the president's judgment and the committee's judgment that made the decision,"" said Braxton Rhone, chairman of the FSW Board of Trustees. ""I think that she has done an excellent job in the past. I am looking forward to her continuing to do a good job.""

FSW President Jeff Allbritten was unavailable Monday for comment, a spokesman said.

DeLuca has had a long career in education that includes experience in the K-12 system.

She earned a bachelor's degree in English education in 1994 at the University of South Florida. She received a master's degree in education at The College of New Rochelle in New York in 1998 and a doctorate in curriculum and instruction from the University of Florida in 2004.

DeLuca said when she started her career, she wanted to be a high school English teacher. Her career began in the 1990s in the K-12 system, teaching in New York and Lee County. She is a former teacher at Fort Myers High School.

DeLuca said she later began thinking about making a career change. She said she wanted to work at a school of education and help train students who want to be teachers. Her first job doing that was at FSW.

Deborah Teed, who led the search committee, said DeLuca's experience at FSW is one of the things that separated her from the other candidates for the job.

""I, honestly, think we have a wonderful provost ..., and I think we are all happy about it,"" said Teed, who is dean of FSW's School of Arts, Humanities and Social Science.

DeLuca said she thinks her selection as FSW provost brings some stability to the office for a few reasons. She noted that she is not an outsider, so she won't have to spend time learning about FSW. DeLuca also said she isn't looking to make immediate changes or take the college in a new direction that might cause some disruption.

DeLuca said her most immediate plans as provost are to continue and expand some of the programs at FSW that are doing well, such as its honors scholars and study abroad program

""I know the direction we have been headed, but I also know just as any institution we can continue to innovate and improve,"" she said.

1223,LCSO: Man found dead Sunday on boat in Pine Island Sound suffered medical event,"CLOSE Keep your recreational boating safe and sane with these tips from the U.S. Coast Guard. Wochit

The Lee County Sheriff's Office is investigating the death of a man found on a boat off Pine Island Sound on Sunday.

The man's death was reported shortly after 3:30 p.m. and was apparently caused by a medical event, the Sheriff's Office said. Further details were not available.

The man's death is the sixth fatality this year on Lee County waters, more than double the total number of such deaths in the county for the previous year.

Only two people died in boating accidents in 2018. Nine people died in boating accidents in 2017, leading the state in deaths for that year.

The other 2019 fatalities include:

Feb 10: The body of a boater who fell overboard on the Caloosahatchee River near the Edison Bridge in Fort Myers was recovered later in the day by a dive team.

March 1: A boater died when he fell overboard in Bokeelia, near Charlotte Harbor.

March 8: Irene Doyle Sabo, 52, of New Jersey died when she got tangled in a boat's propellers when her husband, Joseph Sabo, attempted to get off a sandbar on Fort Myers Beach. State investigators said alcohol was involved and charges are pending.

Also, the same day, Dr. Omar Benitez, 51, of Fort Myers died in a single-boat crash on Hendry Creek off Estero Bay. He was the only person on the boat, reports indicate.

April 3: A woman was killed when she fell overboard near Captiva Island and Cayo Costa. She was one of three people on board, and witnesses attempted lifesaving measures but were unable to revive her.

The cases remain under investigation. It can take anywhere from one week to two months to complete an investigation, depending on the incident, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission investigators.

1228,"A wealthy developer, a local actress, a failed hotel project and an indecent proposal","Palm Beach actress Mia Matthews is busy these days rehearsing in New York City for the upcoming off-Broadway premiere of “After,"" a play about the consequences of a bullying text message.

Off stage, she’s immersed in another emotional production involving texts, this one a bizarre personal drama with one of her biggest admirers — Palm Beach Polo President Glenn Straub.

It’s a drama with salacious allegations detailed in court records, including one ripped from a Hollywood script: In what amounted to an indecent proposal, Straub, who has known Matthews and her husband, Robert “Bob” Matthews, for 20 years, is alleged to have said he let a $27 million mortgage go unpaid “every time Bob let him sleep with Mia.""

Straub denied making any such proposal, although he has engaged in business deals with the Matthewses over the years, including a last-minute loan that saved their Nantucket summer home from foreclosure in 2010.

But he admits sending Mia flirtatious text messages last year, sometimes as a joke, including one with a reference to oral sex. He also bought her earrings, took her to a Broadway show, offered to pay her daughter's tuition, gave loaner cars to the family and provided $300,000 to help Mia and Bob hire criminal lawyers, according to court records.

Those apparent extensions of generosity came at a time when Mia and her husband were desperate and vulnerable: They had been targeted and later charged in a federal fraud investigation into a failed Palm Beach hotel project.

Prosecutors were building a case that Bob, Mia and others had misused millions of dollars that was supposed to be spent to renovate the Palm House Hotel, court records show. The money had been pledged through a federal program by foreign investors seeking green cards.

Bob and Mia are accused of spending some of that money on mortgage and tax payments for their homes and lavish indulgences, such as a yacht, luxury cars and a Paris vacation on a private plane, according to prosecutors.

Bob was among four men, including his brother, arrested in March on multiple fraud charges. As the Palm House scandal swirled in the months before Mia’s arrest in August on a single count of tax evasion, Straub pursued her for an intimate relationship and told her to leave her husband, according to text messages described in court records and a provocative legal argument targeting Straub.

But when Mia refused his advances, he sued her and Bob demanding they return the money he said he loaned them for their lawyers. He also filed a separate lawsuit against the Connecticut law firm representing Bob Matthews, demanding the return of the $150,000 retainer Palm Beach Polo had wired in May.

Mia is not the first female friend Straub has taken to court. Since 2013, five former girlfriends, all significantly younger than Straub, have been sued by his companies over alleged broken debts, The Palm Beach Post reported in November. Two of those women said the lawsuits are frivolous and accused Straub of suing only because they broke up with him.

Although Mia never accused Straub in court records of suing for romantic revenge, lawyers in a Palm House bankruptcy case say he filed the lawsuit just days after she rebuffed his advances.

In court records, Mia said $150,000 of the money “was not a loan but was instead a gift” provided by Straub “without expectation of repayment."" Similar claims were made by other women who have been sued by him.

Straub dismissed the lawsuit against Bob and Mia on Jan. 28 after he said they “paid a good chunk of it back,"" he told The Post. His lawsuit against Bob Matthews’ criminal law firm was settled in December, a few weeks after a Connecticut judicial panel dismissed a professional grievance that Straub had filed against the firm.

Straub, 72, denies having ever been anything more than just a “close friend” to Mia, 52.

In August, he offered a different take on Mia to an FBI agent. Straub considered Mia “an instigator” who drove her husband ""to the ‘high life'” and Bob “'a ‘salesman’ who used ‘every tactic’ to keep Mia happy in the lifestyle,"" according to an FBI memo shown during a Palm House bankruptcy trial.

Bob, 61, and Mia, who each pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges, both declined to comment for this story. Mia referred questions to her attorney, Brian Spears of Connecticut, who declined to comment.

Bob and Mia certainly were aware of Straub’s litigious history — they’d been sued by him at least once before, in 2010 over the Nantucket loan. But with the Palm House scandal engulfing them, they had no other choice but to lean on the wealthy businessman for help.

“(I)f you look at Wikipedia under Glenn Straub it says most litigious person in South Florida,"" Bob Matthews said at a Securities and Exchange Commission hearing in January 2017.

“I mean, Glenn loves to have coffee with you in the morning, sue you in the afternoon and play tennis with you in the evening. He has this thing where it’s fun. He loves going to court.""

‘Famous signer’ in the USA

Mia’s smiling face once briefly adorned an electronic billboard in Times Square, an image used in a Palm House promotional brochure sent a few years ago to potential investors in China, Iran and Turkey.

The brochures claimed, erroneously, according to federal prosecutors, that former President Bill Clinton, singer Tony Bennett and other celebrities had pledged to be members of the Palm House Club “due in part to the fame of Mia Matthews, the developer Robert Matthews’ wife. Mia Matthews is a famous signer"" — the word “singer” is misspelled — “and entertainer in the USA.""

How famous? That’s up for interpretation. But by most accounts, Mia has enjoyed a modestly successful career.

She had an uncredited appearance as a bartender in a 1997 episode of Michael J. Fox’s “Spin City” and she enjoyed a 52-episode run playing a witch called Desdemona in Nickelodeon’s “Every Witch Way” in 2014-15.

Her website mentions films, brief television roles on a Fox’s “13 Bourbon Street” and the short-lived Hulu series “South Beach,” along with appearances on David Letterman and in TV commercials for Old Navy and the Florida Lottery.

She won a regional acting award for her performance in 2016 in a Miami play, and she can be seen in YouTube clips singing and cartwheeling in “The Bombshell Show,” in which she portrays iconic singers.

Straub said he has attended some of Mia’s performances. Watching her cartwheel across the stage during “The Bombshell Show” a few years ago made an impression on the wealthy developer.

“I knew of her because she was an actress and I’d seen her at different events and she’d do that cartwheel,"" Straub, who has been divorced since 2009, said in a deposition. Her “claim to fame is that she does a cartwheel, a perfect cartwheel, on stage.""

Since Mia married Bob in 1997, she enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle with homes in Palm Beach, Nantucket and Connecticut. In recent years, they were members of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a Lago Club, the Breakers and the Kravis Center, and Mia drove luxury cars such as an Aston Martin, Maserati and Mercedes Hummer, according to statements her husband’s bookkeeper gave to SEC investigators in 2016.

Photos of Mia and Bob on Nantucket with the Clintons, actor Alec Baldwin and the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy — photo ops made decades ago through her husband’s business and political connections — were included in Palm House promotional material.

More recently, she has mingled at Palm Beach society events with Trump, Palm Beach billionaire Bill Koch, golfer Greg Norman and, of course, Straub.

‘A father figure’

No stranger to controversy, Straub is a proud, hard-nosed businessman with a talent for mining gold from distressed properties and a penchant for butting heads with opponents big and small. He can be pugnacious and polarizing — in January, he was accused of making racially insensitive comments at a Wellington Village Council meeting.

He has forged connections to powerful people, including State Attorney Dave Aronberg, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath and President Trump, who also knows Mia. (In a deposition, Straub says Trump asked about Mia during a phone conversation Straub says he had with the president last summer.)

Straub doesn’t deny that he finds Mia attractive. “She raised two kids, she works and she is beautiful,"" he said.

But he said he always considered himself more as “a father figure” to her, a contention challenged by attorneys opposing Straub in the bankruptcy case. It is the bankruptcy case files, of all places, that contain the most salacious allegations about Straub’s “bizarre and influential” relationship with Mia and her husband.

Straub and Mia have had “a very complicated relationship"" that at some point was “intimate,"" according to allegations by attorney Phil Landau, who represents the entity that owns the Palm House property in the bankruptcy case filed in August.

Why else, he asked, would Straub continue doing business with Mia and her husband after he’d sued them for defaulting on a short-term $775,000 loan Straub gave in 2010 to save their Nantucket home from foreclosure?

That loan included an unusual stipulation, added by Straub, for Matthews to sell the home and put the proceeds into a trust for the benefit of Mia and the couple’s two daughters.

Then there’s the letter Straub wrote to federal prosecutors in June, three months after Bob Matthews was arrested and ordered to stop communicating with potential witnesses, Landau said.

In the letter, Straub asked prosecutors to make an exception for him, describing himself as “an acquaintance” of Bob Matthews and “a close friend” of Mia’s who needed to “provide moral support” since “all of the Matthewses’ other friends are avoiding them because of the indictment.""

Even though permission was granted, Straub said he hasn’t had too much communication lately with Bob Matthews. But he apparently has communicated plenty with Matthews’ wife.

Salacious text messages

Mia hasn’t said much publicly about her relationship with Straub. In fact, she invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 600 times in a deposition Nov. 26 when two lawyers grilled her for seven hours about flirtatious text messages Straub exchanged with her last year.

The actual texts are not included in court records. The only public description of their contents comes from a transcript of the attorneys reading them during the deposition, and those were only a sample of the texts Straub and Mia exchanged.

The text messages, the attorneys say, show that Straub either had or at least pursued a relationship with Mia that went beyond friendship, making him an “insider” who shouldn’t be allowed to seek claims in the Palm House bankruptcy.

“(A)s bad my situation is, I can’t accept your offer to be a significant other in order for you to drop the lawsuit,"" Mia texted Straub on July 16, more than a week after his company sued her and Bob.

“This whole thing is heartbreaking,"" her text continues. “I can’t say that we would end up together, but I will say any hopes of that are dashed with your recent actions and behavior. Being with someone who threatens to put me in jail, promises things, then takes them away, and tells me that he will do whatever he can to destroy me, won’t work. I wish things were different.""

But when the lawyers asked her to elaborate on those and other texts, her response was the same: “On advice of counsel, I’m exercising my rights under the Fifth Amendment and declining to answer the question.""

During the depositions, neither Mia, Straub nor their lawyers disputed the authenticity of the texts.

Texts earlier in the year suggest Mia made several requests to Straub — for a job, for money for her daughter’s acting class and for permission to use his credit card to go shopping.

Other texts suggest they attended a Broadway show. And in others, Straub appears to offer her an apartment in Aspen, Colo., and legal advice about her husband’s criminal case.

On July 3, Straub texted Mia a warning that he planned to sue her in St. Lucie County, an hour from Palm Beach County, to “keep these facts out of the public eyes and your daughter’s friends’ gossip. …"" In a deposition in November, Straub confirmed the text, saying, “That’s a little trick I got. To keep things out of the newspaper, I’ll sue in other counties.""

A month later, on Aug. 8, Mia sent Straub a text that Landau assumed was about her husband: “I talked to him. Told him the truth. He was relieved we didn’t have sexual contact. And understood my desperation in trying to get you to back off the lawsuit. …""

‘You anxious boy’

Other texts sound racy.

“Any interest in a dinner and sleepover party?” Straub asks May 20. Mia replies, “I have church at five. Could do dinner after but no sleepovers yet. You anxious boy.""

On June 18, Mia texted Straub about a pair of earrings she wanted to give to her daughter: “I think I may give her the little hoops you bought me. Is that okay with you?"" Straub replies, “Okay, as you know the prices of gold doubled, so I get one BJ for each side over three days.""

When Landau read those texts, an attorney for Straub’s lending company interjected. “Are you done? Is there a question there? I want to express my embarrassment on your behalf, Phil,"" said attorney Luis Salazar.

Landau replied, “And I’m embarrassed that we have to be here reading through this.""

In his own deposition three days later, Straub was asked if the “BJ” reference was meant as a colloquial term for oral sex.

“When you’re acting as a father figure to women, do you suggest that they should come and give you three BJs for something that you’re doing for them?” asked attorney David George, who represents 61 Palm House investors from China, Iran and Turkey who sued the Matthewses, Straub’s lending company and others in federal court in 2016.

Straub replied, “I do a lot of that kind of comments. To me, it’s like your first-born child. If you don’t pay me, you owe me a BJ. In other words, that’s very, very personal to people. They will usually pay you the money they owe you. …""

Straub admits he encouraged Mia to leave her husband, who is facing 325 years in prison if convicted on all counts, and to move to Aspen. But only so she can get a new start on her life, not to run off with him.

“You can interpret those texts to whatever you want. I never had sex with the girl,"" Straub said Nov. 29 in a deposition. “I’m saying to you, she always fascinated me that she was a worker like my daughters.""

Disputing the attorneys’ characterization, Straub said, “I wouldn’t call it an intimate relationship. It is a relationship with a woman that has got herself in trouble through her husband.""

Mia didn’t invoke the Fifth for every question during her seven-hour deposition. When Landau asked why she was crying, she replied, “My eyes are watering from yawning and from not getting a lot of, from work.""

Straub, who attended her deposition, interjected with a skeptical remark: “She’s an actress.""

‘Character assassination’

Perhaps the most explosive allegation about Straub and Mia was made by developer Ryan Black, a minority owner of Palm House, in an email to Landau on Aug. 29.

Describing a meeting he attended at Straub’s Wellington office in November 2014, Black said Straub was asked why he’d waited to foreclose on the Palm House mortgage five months after Matthews had started defaulting on payments.

Straub replied that “he would give Bob an extension every time Bob let him sleep with Mia,"" according to Black’s email, which is included in court records.

In an interview with The Post, Straub said, “I don’t remember ever, ever making that kind of remark. If I did, I’m sure it was a dumb joke. I’m a 72-year-old guy. I’m allowed to make some dumb-ass jokes.""

Black didn’t return a phone call and email from The Post.

Although Straub wasn’t asked about the Black email during his deposition, he was questioned about the “sleepover” text he’d sent Mia.

“I’d love to have her stay, spend some time with me, but she was always coy,"" he replied. “That’s why we never had sex. She’s been a player from day one.""

In court records, Salazar, the lawyer for Straub’s lending company, accused Landau of resorting to “a character assassination strategy” against Straub because he has a weak case.

“Debtor then makes up this deficit in substantive, relevant facts by dumping a truckload of tabloid fodder that might support newspaper sales in the checkout aisle but here amount to irrelevant tripe,"" Salazar said in an October filing.

None of the salacious allegations about Straub and Mia were mentioned in the time-limited, non-jury Palm House federal bankruptcy trial that ended Feb. 22 when a judge invalidated Straub’s mortgage claim on the hotel.

Meanwhile, Straub continues to deny accusations by Palm House investors in federal and state civil lawsuits that his lending company conspired with Matthews to steal their money.

Best supporting actress?

Barring another rescue from Straub, Bob and Mia won’t be living much longer at Casa Bendita, the spacious $30 million oceanfront mansion they built in 2006 next to a house owned until September by fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.

Once the scene of society galas and charity parties hosted by the couple, Casa Bendita — Spanish for “Blessed House” — is scheduled to be sold at an auction March 28 as part of Bob Matthews’ personal bankruptcy case.

A few months after that, Bob and Mia are scheduled to stand trial in Connecticut along with Palm Beach attorney Les Evans in the Palm House criminal case.

But before that trial, Mia will be judged on-stage April 8 at the 43rd Annual Carbonell Awards, which honor the best of South Florida theater.

She’s been nominated as best supporting actress for her role as Marie Antoinette in “The Revolutionists” at the Theatre Lab in Boca Raton. It’s not her first Carbonell nod.

In 2016, she won for her role in the Miami production of “After,” the same play she’s currently rehearsing for an off-Broadway run that starts March 17 and ends April 14.

1229,"Edgewater woman, 97, recalls torture, abuse in Nazi concentration camps","Through a small square in the side of a boxcar cramped with human cargo, 22-year-old Elsie Ragusin watched the cities of Central Europe pass in and out of view.

The smell of human waste hung heavy in the thick heat. Hunger blurred her vision.

For five days in August 1944, the train traveled from northern Italy to Vienna, east to Budapest and up across Czechoslovakia and into Poland — no food, no water and no reprieve for its passengers.

Ragusin dared not budge from her place beside the sole source of fresh air and sunlight.

“If you moved, you’re afraid to be trampled,” Ragusin said. “I couldn’t squat down or anything.”

Ragusin was in shock.

What’s going on? Why am I being held?

“It was horrible. I couldn’t understand what was happening,” said Ragusin, now 97 and living in Edgewater. “I was stunned most of the time.”

Earlier that spring, German troops occupied Lussino, twin Italian isles off the Croatian coast where Ragusin was visiting her grandparents.

Nazi soldiers entered their home and demanded Ragusin and her father accompany them for questioning on suspicions of spying for the Allies.

She languished in jail cells for weeks, and then was put on a train bound, she thought, for factory work in Germany. That still seemed a possibility five days later when she stepped off the train in front of a hall with huge doors.

But several hours later when she entered a brick barracks lined with overcrowded bunks, she finally realized.

This was no factory.

Ragusin had arrived at Auschwitz, a sprawling death camp complex in Poland to which the Nazis deported more than 1.3 million people during Adolf Hitler’s regime.

Prisoners were shipped to Auschwitz from all over Europe. Most were Jews. Some were political dissidents. Others belonged to ethnic or social groups Hitler sought to eradicate.

But as far as Ragusin knew, she was the only American.

A sudden shift

From the deck of an Italian steamship, Ragusin (pronounced Ra-gu-ZEEN) gazed with eager eyes on majestic Mediterranean palaces and centuries-old monuments she’d only imagined in her native New York.

It was her third transatlantic voyage, but the first she was old enough to appreciate.

Soon after she was born on Nov. 4, 1921, her parents, Giovanni and Domenica Ragusin, took Elsie and her three older brothers to Lussino, their ancestral homeland, to meet the rest of the family.

But on this 1939 trip, 17 years old and fresh out of high school, Ragusin was mesmerized by every port they passed. Lisbon, Barcelona, Genoa, Corfu, Venice — each city enchanted her further.

Her fantasy continued when she arrived with her mother and father at her family’s seaside villa on Lussinpiccolo, the smaller of the Lussino islands. Their stay extended several years to care for her aging grandparents.

Ragusin explored castles, joined a theater group, assisted university students with English language compositions and fell for a striking 22-year-old navy captain named Toni Rocchi.

Neighbors called her the “most beautiful girl on the island” and numerous men sought her hand in marriage. But she had eyes only for Toni.

They danced on the moonlit shore, reveled at romantic military balls and took walks along the waterfront under their families’ watchful eyes.

“I had the love of my life in Europe,” Ragusin said. “He was a beautiful, kind man.”

He didn’t officially propose — the looming war cast a long shadow of uncertainty — but he asked her to wait for him. It was all the assurance she needed. “I knew I was his, you know, and that was it,” she said.

Toni was called to active duty on a warship in 1941, and the idyllic future she foresaw was snatched away.

Unjust imprisonment

At first, it seemed like a simple misunderstanding.

Soon after German forces occupied Lussino in spring 1944, two Nazi soldiers entered her grandparents’ home and accused Ragusin and her father of signaling Allied aircraft with cigarettes. Her mother and extended family were not implicated.

“I never smoked in my life,” Ragusin said. “(They said) we were spies, and that never happened. And then they were saying, too, that we were Jews, and that didn’t work out because we were Roman Catholic.”

Perhaps someone pointed the Nazis toward her and her father to spare their own life or curry favor with the occupying army. She still doesn’t know.

The soldiers ordered them to pack suitcases — they would be detained for a night or two until they could be interrogated.

But days stretched into weeks. They were shifted to other cities, other prisons. Ragusin’s father explained to authorities that it was all a big mistake. Instead of being freed, they were fingerprinted and separated.

Ragusin was moved to Trieste, in a northeastern nook of mainland Italy, and jailed with female political prisoners in a filthy, rat-infested cell. There, the seriousness of her situation set in.

Prisoners were selected for execution at random. Ragusin heard the screams of those who were tortured. The survivors returned with harrowing accounts of barbaric brutality.

She found hope in rumors that they might be sent by train to Germany. After so long in a prison cell, even the thought of forced labor seemed an escape.

At the station, she saw a familiar face among men being herded from one train to another.

“I saw my father and oh — that beautiful face,” Ragusin said. “I ran to him and he spotted me and ran to me and we embraced.”

A German soldier tore them apart, spat insults and shoved them into separate lines.

“He was put on one train, which went somewhere, I didn’t know where, and I was put in another,” she said. “And that was the last time I saw my father.”

‘Nothing but bones’

Five numbers tattooed on Ragusin’s forearm have faded with time, but her memory of the moment they were inked remains fresh.

Ragusin already was within the walls of Auschwitz when the train came to a stop at the end of her transcontinental trek from Trieste.

She hadn’t eaten, drunk, slept or sat down for five days.

The boxcar door slid open, and the bodies of those who perished on the journey tumbled out. The survivors waited on a platform for hours to enter a large hall that led into what she discovered later was a gas chamber.

Their suitcases were taken first, next their garments and then their dignity.

“I never took my clothes off in front of (anyone) — never,” Ragusin said. “And here I was naked in front of all these people. I think I died several times. I was so humiliated.”

She begged to keep her gold necklace with its cross pendant, her gold watch and a ring, a graduation gift from her parents. “You don’t need them here,” she recalled a guard’s cold reply.

They shaved her body and cropped her long, brown hair. She was sprayed with water — first scalding, then freezing — and doused with insecticide. The women lined up again, still naked, for officers to assess.

Women huddled together for warmth and were beaten for it. One fell to the floor in front of Ragusin, bleeding from a gash on her head.

“But you can’t pick them up,” she said. “You can’t do anything, you just have to stay there and look.”

A high-ranking Nazi officer she later learned was Adolf Eichmann, whom Hitler tasked with coordinating the Jews’ extermination, decided their fate with a flick of his finger.

“He'd mark you: Go this way or that way,” Ragusin said. “It meant those (sent to one side) are to go to work, and those (pointed to the other) will be killed.”

Those selected for labor had a number tattooed atop their left forearms. Ragusin no longer had a name. She was 82384.

She received one damp, smelly blue-and-gray dress, but no undergarments or shoes.

Prisoners slept in muddy barracks lined with rows of bunk beds. Seven to 10 people squeezed on their sides into each bunk with one blanket between them.

“When you open a can of sardines, they’re this way and that way — that’s how it was with people,” Ragusin said. “How could you ever sleep?”

She covered her face with her hands at night to protect it from being kicked.

They were roused daily at 2 or 3 a.m. for roll call. Many collapsed and died, too weak to stand at attention for hours in the rain or snow until the count was correct. The rest went to work.

A sign on the camp gate in German stated “Arbeit macht frei” — work sets you free — but Ragusin couldn’t read it.

She mixed cement, chopped wood and laid bricks to build more barracks. Her arms bled from carrying rocks and pushing heavy carts laden with sand and boulders. She sometimes worked all day and night with no rest.

“It was so atrocious, so hard to believe the things that were happening,” Ragusin said. “You never could imagine all the beatings and everything else.”

Guards struck her more than once as punishment for not working fast enough. One whipped her so hard across her left ear that she lost hearing.

She refused to show weakness.

“I was afraid that if they see that I’m hurting, they might shoot me,” she said, so she tucked her bloody face into her shoulder and kept going. “I never heard (out of that ear) again.”

Food was scant, and sanitation was nonexistent.

The latrine — if there was time to use it — was a row of holes in the ground, out in the open. Breakfast was a mug of ground beans.

“And then later, coming home (after work) for supper, we had a piece of black bread — very hard, which I broke my tooth on — a piece of margarine, a piece of some kind of bologna. But that was it,” Ragusin said.

Disease was rampant. Body lice spread typhus fever. Dysentery was common, and feces-contaminated drinking water induced typhoid.

“We were starving and thirsty because you knew if you drink the water, you’re gone,” Ragusin said.

She went barefoot for weeks until she bartered some bread for mismatched, holey shoes from a prisoner who worked unloading luggage from incoming transports. She stuffed scraps of paper and trash into the slits to keep the mud out.

Days and dates were meaningless. Her 23rd birthday passed, but she had no notion of it. Her withering body was the only means of measurement.

“I was a skeleton,” Ragusin said. “My face was sunk and my legs, my arms — just bones. Nothing but bones.”

She felt utterly alone. “I had no friends because you can’t trust anybody,” she said. “Who put you there? You don’t know. You can’t believe anybody.”

During the several months Ragusin estimates she spent at Auschwitz, she watched desperate prisoners grab the camp’s electric fence to kill themselves. Others tried to escape and were hanged. But she still held on to hope.

‘A lot to live for’

She’d always been strong-willed.

At age 2 or 3, Ragusin wandered away from her family’s Lussino home. Her panicked mother searched among the nearby shops until she found some men singing and drinking wine. One had Ragusin on his knee, singing along.

To forestall any further adventures, her mother took her sandals away, sure that Ragusin wouldn’t walk barefoot down the rocky path leading toward town. Her mother was wrong.

“Sure enough, I went there again without shoes,” Ragusin said. “I was a little rebel.”

Her innate perseverance kept her alive, but the waning days of the war tested her resilience more than ever.

As Allied forces approached Auschwitz in January 1945, she was shipped west by train to Ravensbrück, an all-female camp in northeast Germany.

It was as if the whole horrible nightmare was rewound and played again: a 400-mile journey in an overburdened boxcar during the heart of winter, the same humiliating intake process and selection. Only Ravensbrück was even worse than Auschwitz.

A colored cloth triangle on each woman’s uniform depicted why she was imprisoned. Jews wore a yellow triangle. Ragusin’s was red — designating her a political prisoner.

“I was so angry,” she said, still incensed at the injustice of it all. “I did nothing wrong.”

She traded a day’s supper for a needle and thread and sewed “USA” onto her red patch in defiance. Guards never confronted her about it.

She was quarantined for almost a month with hardly any food and infected sores spread over her body.

Once she was released into the general population, she worked in factories making parts for bombs, sawed down trees and dug holes in the forest. The prisoners on duty when the holes were deep enough were shot and shoved in.

People around her constantly died or disappeared, hauled away in trucks and never seen again.

A tooth once caused her such pain that she couldn’t work. Guards pulled it with pliers and no anesthesia. “I thought my whole insides were being taken out,” she said.

Even that was better than being taken to the medical ward, where “unthinkable” things happened.

Josef Mengele, a German physician who became known as the “angel of death,” subjected some prisoners to grotesque and inhumane procedures.

Ragusin underwent frequent “examinations,” she said. Women would be made to stand naked in front of large windows to be X-rayed and injected with unknown substances.

“You see the doctors standing there watching,” she said. “You have to parade in front of them. If you could, you could have just stabbed and killed them. Many times that’s how I felt. But you had to keep your sanity and keep on going, just be strong.”

Some experiments — cruel attempts at sterilization — were too graphic to describe in detail.

She remembers six doctors in white uniforms holding down her head, arms and feet, and then excruciating pain.

Her mind flashed to her fiance, Toni, and she mourned her lost innocence. She thought of her mother and father, her brothers back in New York and her Catholic faith.

“When they let me out that time, I said, ‘God, I want you to make a hole and put me right down there,’” Ragusin said. “I wanted him to bury me. I was so embarrassed, so ashamed. I didn’t want to live anymore for what they did.”

But she longed to see her family and Toni again. And so, as she had done so many days before, she summoned the courage to carry on.

“I kept on fighting all the time. Because I did want to live. I didn’t want to die then,” she said. “I thought, ‘I have a lot to live for.’”

The Swedish Red Cross arrived at Ravensbrück on April 24, 1945. And not a moment too soon. The Nazis had begun locking prisoners in and setting their barracks on fire. Ragusin heard hers was next.

She was taken to Sweden and later Denmark to recover and returned to the U.S. in late December 1945.

Her mother hid out in Italy until the war ended and came home to New York in 1947. Her father perished in Buchenwald concentration camp. Toni was killed in battle, and her youthful dreams died with him.

But 10 years later, she had a son. His father looked just like Toni.

‘God always saved me’

Ragusin has lived 1,170 months. She spent just 10 of them in Nazi jails and camps.

She has three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. She wrote a book. She loved and lost other men.

But she never recovered what those 10 months took from her.

She wasn’t a soldier, but she did go to war. She has no pension to show for it.

Ragusin resides alone in a retirement community, struggling to survive on her Social Security stipend. She relies on the Council on Aging of Volusia County to supply her with meals several times a week.

The same questions she grappled with at 22 have haunted her for 70 years.

“God always saved me in the camp,” Ragusin said. But why? Why was she there? Why is she here now?

She settles on two reasons. The first is her son, who lives with his wife a few doors down.

The other is her testimony.

Two years ago, a married couple asked Ragusin to meet their teenage daughter, who had fallen in with Nazi extremists and begun preaching their ideology in internet videos: The Holocaust was a hoax. Those sent to camps had plenty of food and spent their time relaxing in swimming pools.

Ragusin met with the girl and shared all she’d endured.

“Later, she called (me) and she said, ‘You saved my life,’” Ragusin said. “I think that’s why maybe I’m here.”

'Never forget'

The Holocaust survivors’ rallying cry has long been “never forget.”

As the youngest survivors age into their 70s, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., makes a special effort to preserve firsthand accounts in order to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike.

To honor this week's Days of Remembrance, established by Congress as the nation’s annual Holocaust commemoration, The News-Journal is sharing the individual accounts of four local Holocaust survivors.

Aimee Rubensteen, the museum's acquisitions coordinator, travels South Florida “rescuing the evidence of the Holocaust by speaking to firsthand witnesses,” she said, and collecting their World War II-era photos, letters, newspaper clippings, clothing and other artifacts of historical value — including the red triangle patch on which Elsie Ragusin sewed ""USA"" during her time in a German concentration camp.

“These original artifacts will be the things that teach the Holocaust to future generations,” Rubensteen said.

The museum’s mission is to educate people about what happened during the Holocaust to Jews and non-Jews alike and to encourage critical thinking about how and why those atrocities occurred.

Firsthand stories make those larger themes more personal.

“A lot of people don’t know about these specific, individual stories. The more we spread the word and expand the conversation, the better it is for everyone,” Rubensteen said.

Individuals or families who are interested in sharing their Holocaust artifacts or family keepsakes with the museum may contact Rubensteen at 786-496-2788 or arubensteen@ushmm.org to schedule an appointment.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190427/edgewater-woman-97-recalls-torture-abuse-in-nazi-concentration-camps?rssfeed=true,2019-04-27T19:37:47Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA",FL,32117

1237,"10 plays in two hours? The 10-minute-play trend comes to Fort Myers, Bonita Springs","The actors from Lab Theater's ""The Festival of Tens"" (Photo: Paula Sisk)

Got 10 minutes? Then you have time to watch an entire play.

How about 100 minutes? Even better: You can cram 10 plays in less than two hours.

It’s all part of a national trend with 10-minute play festivals happening everywhere. Now that trend visits Southwest Florida in a big way with two events happening this weekend: The Laboratory Theater of Florida’s new “The Festival of Tens” and the Center for Performing Arts Bonita Springs’s third-annual “Stage It! 10 Minute Play Competition.”

“It’s been a popular format for a while,” say actor/director Frank Blocker, who organizes “Stage It!” “Audiences LOVE the format.

“Short attention span? Variety? ... I’m not sure what gets them, but I know I enjoy the constant change of tone, pace and language that occurs and sampling all the places a play can take me.""

The 10-minute play ""Swans"" was staged at the 2018 “Stage It! 10 Minute Play Competition.” (Photo: Special to The News-Press)

The idea isn’t a new one, though. Kentucky’s Actors Theatre of Louisville popularized the concept for 28 years with its National Ten-Minute Play Contest, which involved staging mini plays every year before the contest was discontinued in 2017. Now similar events have popped up in North Carolina, Indiana, Iowa, New York, Washington, D.C. and many more places.

Ten-minute plays may be great for people with short attention spans, but playwright Louise Wigglesworth says they can certainly be challenging to write.

“Short does not mean easy,” says Wigglesworth, who runs Lab Theater’s play-writing class. “(Ten-minute plays) are creative, experimental, complex. They deal with one critical moment in a character's life and in a few words cut through exposition right to the conflict and change.

“They can be comedic, romantic, touching, serious and always a surprise. An evening of these works gives audiences a chance to hear a number of different theater voices.”

Blocker started “Stage It!” three years ago at the Center for Performing Arts Bonita Springs after conducting a similar festival in New York. This year’s contest saw 282 plays submitted from playwrights in 50 states, as well as Canada, England, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Greece and India.

Twenty of those plays will be published in a book sold at the festival. And 10 of those will be performed this weekend, followed by a talk-back with the playwrights after each show.

This year’s “Stage It!” themes include everything from aliens and zombies to bank robberies, agoraphobia and Shakespearian tragicomedy, Blocker says. “The quality goes up every year in scripts, and it’s really jumped this year.”

Farther north in downtown Fort Myers, Lab Theater enlisted its own playwriting class to write plays for “The Festival of Tens.” Wigglesworth thought the exercise would help her students develop and also better understand the production process.

One of those playwrights, News-Press investigative reporter Melanie Payne, came up with a short play about a battle between a woman and her sister-in-law. “It is a commentary on friendship, sibling ties and who is really one’s next-of-kin,” Payne says.

The 10-minute play ""Ebook Meets Treebook"" was featured in the 2018 ""Stage It! 10 Minute Play Competition."" (Photo: Special to The News-Press)

Payne is one of seven local playwrights featured in ""The Festival of Tens."" For people who have never seen a 10-minute play fest, Payne has a handy description to prepare them.

""I like to compare a 10-minute festival to a dim sum dinner,"" Payne says. ""Maybe you get a dumpling you don’t like. But no worries: In a few minutes another cart will come by and you can try a different one.

""When you go to a 10-minute play festival, it’s the same thing. You get a variety of play 'dumplings.' One or two might not be to your taste. Some might be just enough to satisfy. And then there are those that leave you wishing for more.""

Ten-minute play festivals are a good way to find and nurture playwrights, Blocker says. And by publishing the top 20 playwrights in a book, he hopes to inspire other theater groups to stage their own 10-minute play festivals, too.

“The focus of our festival is to promote playwrights, live up to our title of ‘Stage It!’ and encourage others to do the same — all culminating in a production that audiences can enjoy,” he says. “And they most certainly do. It’s been a huge success here. We sold so well last year, we are adding two performances (this year).”

Here’s more about both events:

""Stage It! 10 Minute Play Competition"": Performances of ten 10-minute plays chosen from hundreds of plays submitted to CFABS from all over the world. 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. $25. Center for Performing Arts Bonita Springs, 10150 Bonita Beach Road, Bonita Springs. 495-8989 or artcenterbonita.org

1238,"Cat dies during fumigation at St. Pete home, owner says pest control showed up early","Cat dies during fumigation at St. Pete home, owner says pest control showed up early Video

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) - A St. Petersburg woman says her cat is dead after a pest control company showed up too early to tent her home for termites.

Caroline Stadler recently moved into a home in St. Petersburg and discovered termites.

Like many Florida homeowners, she learned the most effective way to get rid of the termites is to hire a pest control company to tent her entire home.

The company then releases deadly gas into the home that kills termites - and anything else living inside.

Pest control companies advise clients that all pets and people must be removed from the home before the process can begin.

Stadler hired Terminix for the job and tells 8 On Your Side she had a contract stating they would show up at 3 p.m. Monday to begin the work.

""I was supposed to get off work at 1 p.m. and I was going to come by and get my cat and get all my stuff and get out. But when I pulled up around 1:30, my house was already tented with my cat inside,"" said Stadler.

To her horror, Stadler realized the workers had already released the deadly gas. They would not allow her to go inside to get her cat, Dahlia.

""My cat, she hides, she's scared of everything. If she saw people that she didn't know, was in a situation that she wasn't familiar with, she's going to hide and I assume that's what happened. She hid under my bed and you can't see her when she hides,"" said Stadler.

A worker put on a gas mask and went inside. They found her cat, but it was already dead.

""They didn't even know a cat was in there and Terminix was supposed to tell them that an animal was in there,"" said Stadler.

She feels it should have been obvious to the workers there was an animal in the house.

""They saw a litter box, they saw food, they could have seen that I wasn't ready,"" said Stadler.

Her neighbors found her in front of her house, on her knees, sobbing.

""That's her family member, it's not just a cat okay. It's someone she's had with her a long time, she cares about and the attitude of these people was just that they didn't care,"" said her neighbor Romeo Desrosiers.

Terminix issued the following statement to 8 On Your Side:

""We were recently made aware of the incident involving a fumigation at a customer's home. The safety and satisfaction of our customers is our top priority, and we are looking into the matter internally with our preferred fumigation service provider.""

Stadler says nothing will bring back her beloved cat.

""I'm mad, I'm very mad and I'm sad,"" said Stadler.",https://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/cat-dies-during-fumigation-at-st-pete-home-owner-says-pest-control-showed-up-early/1947542603,2019-04-24T01:44:26Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

Troopers said the 78-year-old woman was pronounced deceased at the scene. The 54-year-old woman and the 57-year-old man are siblings, and the victim was their mother, FHP officials said. The brother and sister are at Ocala Regional Medical Center in critical condition.

In the second vehicle, a 2005 Chevy Cobalt, two people were killed at the location. Their names were released on Sunday. Troopers identified the driver as 36-year-old Justin Matthew Klemm and the passenger as Brandin Drew McCoy, 33, both of Dunnellon.

The wreck occurred in front of Classic Mile Park Training Center, approximately a mile east from Southwest 140th Avenue, at 5:40 p.m. Saturday.

FHP troopers said the Chevy Cobalt was traveling east on SR 40 and the pickup was traveling west. Authorities said that, for unknown reasons, the driver of the Cobalt drove partially off the roadway and, returning to the road, went into the westbound lane. The pickup then collided with the car.



Kim Horton, who witnessed the crash, told the Star-Banner the driver of the Cobalt appeared to be speeding and the driver lost control of the car.



The FHP investigation is ongoing.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190423/additiona-sr-40-crash-victims-names-released?rssfeed=true,2019-04-23T19:41:32Z,Ocala.com,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA",FL,34471
1245,Neighbors near Cape Coral shooting wary after Monday incident,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Lee County on news-press.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

Residents near a Monday shooting said they are ""uneasy"" in the day following the incident, describing the neighborhood as quiet.

Meanwhile Cape Coral police continued investigating what they are calling a targeted shooting that left one person with multiple gunshot wounds.

The shooting was reported to police shortly before 3:30 p.m. Monday at 1013 SE 24th Ave. They found a man at the back of the home, lying on a table outside.

Police said they believe the shooting was targeted but could not say if the victim knew the perpetrator.

A heavily redacted police report indicated witnesses described a Honda sedan containing ""three or four"" people who were responsible for the shooting.

The report also had witnesses suggesting a drug transaction could have been an issue.

Neighbors along SE 24th said they pretty much keep to themselves with little interaction between neighbors.

Most of those who answered their doors in the vicinity of the shooting declined to be identified and said they don't know their neighbors.

""I didn't see anything,"" said Janet Rochford, who lives across the street from the shooting site. ""We don't know anyone over there.""

Rochford said that the area is usually quiet, but there have been a few thefts which prompted some residents to put in surveillance cameras.

June Presly, who lives next door to where the shooting occurred, said she and her kids were home but all she heard was a loud banging.

""I thought someone had hit the wall, the 6-year resident of Southeast 24th said. ""Then I came outside. I thought our kayak fell over. We usually stay in our cocoon. The kids usually call me if there's trouble.""

Presly said she does not know the residents at 1013 except that they've lived there about a year.

""It's a younger couple,"" she said.

Two men and a woman with bright red hair entered the home Tuesday shortly after noon but would not come to the door.

One woman a few doors down, who has lived at the same SE 24th Street duplex for 35 years, said the street is usually a quiet place.

""I didn't hear a thing,"" Helen Dienst said. ""It's a little unnerving.""

1253,"Opera Naples' 'Carmen' a leaner, focused tale of love and control","The cast of ""Carmen"" at opening night bows (Photo: Harriet Howard Heithaus)

Opera Naples surmounted a major hurdle in its production of ""Carmen"" that opened Wednesday night at Artis—Naples. It got this Carmen casualty to love it.

My feelings toward ""Carmen"" always have been akin to those of a mom with four daughters three years apart who all want to dance in the annual ""Nutcracker."" It just never ends. It's too long, too confusing, too too.

The Opera Naples production, however, devoted all its capital to strong basics. All the principals were solid — even sublime — singers. The orchestra, as it needed to be for the many musical interludes, was so far above competent it wouldn't even see that floor below it.

The dialogue that was chaff — that is, much of the conversation around the gypsy camp — was swept away for a less cluttered foundation. And the jagged, brick-tone geometric staging, thanks to designer Stephan Moravski and crew, took in every setting. Cigarette factory, local inn, mountain hideout, stadium gates: All appeared without the baggage of extended setup time.

This is the third ""Carmen"" within our remembrance to come to Naples. It's easily its best. Stage director Jeffrey Buchman hewed more closely to the Prosper Merrimée novella with several devices that we hope will go to other productions as well. The book actually opens on Don José in his jail cell, reliving the nightmare of his murderous love affair, and so does this production.

In fact, ""Carmen"" is getting stem cell therapy worldwide; those of us who generally glaze just hearing the name should see what's happening with Bizet's most beloved opera. In Florence, for example, the director turned the tables, having Carmen wrestle Don Jose's pistol from him and shoot him before he could stab her.

In another production, Carmen became a mafia moll. In another, less intentional climax, the story goes that the two leads disliked each other so much that the tenor playing Don Jose refused to plunge the knife into Carmen for its final performance. He dropped it at her feet and stomped off stage instead. The quick-witted actress picked up the knife and had Carmen commit suicide.

A ""Carmen"" revolving around Don Jose's jail has a few drawbacks, however.

When we needed to see Don José and Carmen at several of their most dramatic moments, the bars interfered doubly: They kept him too far away from the front of the stage, and the bars occasionally were a physical barrier to his expressions. Cutting out the middle set of bars and incorporating a lock plate to one side — to offer the illusion of a jail door — might have allowed more movement and more visibility for those important scenes.

The incorporation of the dancers also was a concept that needs some fine tuning. Buchman used a trio, representing the three women in Don José's life, to dance around him during some of the orchestral interludes. But their first appearance, all in black, was more reminiscent of the Sisters of Mercy than of the actual characters. Perhaps an identifying scarf around waist, shoulders or head for each would have made their functions clearer.

However, bringing in professional dancers Belen Almaguer, Liliana de la Caridad and Carolina Torres is a brilliant move, with some built-in efficiencies. Their floating turns around Don José in his cell add immensely to the emotional pain of the moments. They also appear as cigarette girls newly released from their work day, dance as gypsies at the inn where Carmen lures Don José into her cadre and celebrate the bullfight festivities.

Gaëlle Arquez, the French mezzo-soprano who plays Carmen, is an inspired choice. We can't rave enough about her dramatic acumen, her gorgeous voice and her physical sensitivity to Carmen's movement. She's a woman who men would gladly follow and she knows it.

As Don José, tenor Rafel Davila knows how to make his character develop steadily, and frighteningly, from mensch to controlling lover. He has a strong voice but can turn it to butter for the famous ""Flower"" aria from the head-over-heels Don José. He might be a bit zaftig for romantic roles, but he is definitely a voice to be reckoned with.

As jilted girlfriend Micaëla, with her heart of butterflies and spine of steel, Heather Phillips is so sweetly commanding you have to cheer for her. Nice girls finish last in Carmen's gritty world, but Phillips' plaintive aria outside the gypsy camp in the third act is an emotional high for the audience.

We'll say it again: If you have the team of the Naples Philharmonic and Opera Naples Artistic Director Ramón Tebar behind your show, you are already leaning 70 percent into a great evening. Add the Opera Naples chorus, handled beautifully, as a bullring audience so we can see and hear them, were an impressive vocal force Wednesday. And, although it seems they missed their cue for the first entrance, the children's chorus handled their music and their baiting of the soldiers beautifully.

Most of the costuming came from Dayton Opera and it was a good choice for this production. The entire effect of this production was strong enough — and it had to be nuclear strength — to make me change my mind. After this experience, yes, I would go see ""Carmen"" again.

1256,"Suspected players in Indian River County, Vero Beach sex spa cases awaiting trial","CLOSE A seldom used ""sneak and peek"" warrant was used to install hidden cameras in the massage parlors involved in the Florida sex spa scandal. Now the question is: Will the videotaped evidence hold up in court? Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — Five women and one man implicated in an investigation into alleged sex spas in Vero Beach and in the county have pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering and prostitution and are awaiting trial.

One of the women, Lanyun Ma, remains the only person charged with human trafficking across an investigation involving multiple agencies and hundreds of arrests across the Treasure Coast.

Lanyun Ma

Ma, 49, of Orlando, ran East Spa in Vero Beach and AA Massage in Sebastian, police said.

She faces charges of racketeering relating to human trafficking and prostitution, engaging in prostitution, deriving support from proceeds of prostitution and unlawful transportation for the purposes of prostitution.

Following an unsuccessful motion by her attorneys to lower her bond, Ma was released April 9 from the Indian River County Jail on $155,500 bail. Court records show the bond was paid in cash by an acquaintance in New York.

Ma was previously arrested on human trafficking charges in 2012 in Oxford, Massachusetts.

According to an Oxford police report, Ma was identified as one of the managers of a massage parlor from which three women were ""rescued from indentured sexual servitude,"" including one who said she was lured from China under the ruse of attending college in California.

Ma pleaded down to a misdemeanor charge of soliciting for prostitution in 2013, court records show.

Detectives continued to explore their options in building a case against spa owner Yongzhang Yan, Ma's husband.

According to court documents, Ma testified Yan returned to their home country of China shortly after her arrest. So far, he has not been charged.

Liyan Zhang

Liyan Zhang, 41, of Pompano Beach, was the owner/operator of East Sea Spa, outside of Sebastian.

Prompted initially by a complaint from a health department official of people living in the spa, a Sheriff's Office investigation found Zhang and her employees were offering sexual services to clients, her arrest report said.

She is charged with racketeering relating to prostitution, operating a house of prostitution and 30 counts of engaging in prostitution. Court records show she was released from jail March 25 on $115,500 bail.

Zhang is fighting in civil court for the return of nearly $133,000 in assets and a vehicle seized by investigators after her arrest.

Others accused

Three women remain in custody after investigators said they offered or performed sexual acts in exchange for money at East Spa in Vero Beach:

Yan Xu, 51, of Sebastian;

Junhua Dong, 50, of Vero Beach;

Yaping Ren, 27, of Orlando;

Each have pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering relating to prostitution and engaging in prostitution.

More: Woman accused of providing sex services to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft arrested

More: 31 male, female customers videotaped at spa Robert Kraft also visited sue over recordings

Xu was also charged with deriving support from the proceeds of prostitution after bank records showed Ma paid Xu nearly $6,000 from accounts linked to spa business, according to her arrest report.

Xu's self-described boyfriend, 64-year-old Kenneth Zullo, of Sebastian, was released late February on $100,000 bail.

According to a case report, Zullo performed odd jobs for Ma, including transporting women between spas owned by Ma's husband in Vero Beach and Orlando.

He is charged with racketeering relating to prostitution.

A Stuart man was arrested after trying to sell a stolen bicycle to the shop that had originally sold the bike.Shane Gill was charged with grand theft and dealing in stolen property.According to investigators, employees at Beyond Bikes became suspicious when Gill walked in with the bicycle, saying he wanted to sell itThey recognized it as a bike they had sold.“We tracked the serial number and it was to a good customer of ours so we knew he probably didn’t sell it,” said Bryan Liles, the owner of Beyond Bikes.An employee called that “good customer,” Ed Burrows.They reached him at work and asked if he had recently sold his bike.“My reaction was, like, ‘I just rode it here. No, I didn’t sell my bike,’” Burrows said. “I’m, like, ‘No, I locked it up.’”Burrows went to see if his bike was still where he had locked it up, outside in front of his work.“I went out, looked at it, and it was gone,” he said. “Totally gone. I was, like, ‘You’ve got to be kidding.’ Somebody actually stole it after it was locked up.”The Martin County Sheriff’s Office said Gill cut the lock off the bike and then brought it to Beyond Bikes, where he tried to sell it.Once they confirmed Burrows had not sold his bike to Gill, employees at Beyond Bikes knew they had to act.“We told the gentleman that was trying to sell it to us to just leave it so we can figure out the value of it,” Liles said.Instead, they called the police, who were waiting to arrest Gill when he came back to the store to check on the status of his bike sale.“I’m happy,” Burrows said. “Beyond Bikes went above and beyond. And that’s why it’s Beyond Bikes. They went above and beyond.”“It’s what I would want to be done to me,” Liles said. “If somebody would retrieve something of mine, I would hope they would do the right thing.”Burrows got his bike back within a few hours.He has since gone out and bought a new lock for the bike.He also now parks it in the break room at work.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/civilian-action-quick-thinking-lead-to-bike-thief-arrest/27246349,2019-04-24T04:09:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410
1259,FLAGLER POLICE BEAT: Road rage against wrong car ends in charges,"A summary roundup of police incident reports in Flagler County for April 17-23.

The following information was compiled from incident reports filed with Flagler County Sheriff's Office and Flagler Beach and Bunnell police departments.

PALM COAST — Charges are pending against a Palm Coast man involved in an April 18 road rage incident, according to a report from the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

The report states that deputies were called by a man who was being tailgated on Belle Terre Parkway by another man driving a white pickup. The caller told deputies that the pickup driver followed him down Royal Palms Parkway, passed him and slammed on his brakes, causing both vehicles to stop in the middle of the street. While the pickup was in front of the first driver's car, he was able to copy down the pickup's license number.

The first driver passed the pickup, whose driver was screaming at him, and drove to his house. The pickup followed him into his driveway and the driver cursed and threatened him.

Deputies used the tag number to determine the pickup driver's address, and he told them a vehicle had cut him off on Interstate 95 and again on State Road 100. He was angry and followed the driver to his house ""to teach him a lesson.""

When deputies asked the pickup driver about the car on I-95, he told them it was a white car but the man he harassed was driving a black Nissan. Deputies also reported that the pickup driver smelled of alcohol and appeared to be intoxicated. Assault charges were referred to the State Attorney's Office.

BUNNELL

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Antoine McDonald New Brunswick, New Jersey mugshot [ + - ] Video Video

ZEPHYRHILLS, Fla. (WFLA) - Months before 20-year-old Antoine McDonald gained fame on the internet when he dressed in a bunny costume and beat on a man who was harrassing a woman in Orlando, McDonald appeared on camera in Pasco County.

The video was released by the Pasco County Sheriff's Office on Tuesday.

McDonald had just rented a UHaul truck at a used car lot on State Road 54 in Zephyrhills. Deputies were watching him as he was a person of interest in a carjacking and two armed robbery cases.

As he pulled into a nearby Walmart parking lot, deputies moved in.

""He sees y'all. So lets take him now,"" one of the deputies can be heard on the radio.

Then, thinking McDonald may be armed, they order him to the ground.

""Hands in the air. Keep them in the air. Turn around. Down on the ground. Down on the ground.""

The incident in Pasco County resulted in McDonald's arrest for fraudulent use of personal identification. According to the arrest report, he used a Delaware man's identification to rent the UHaul truck in Pasco County.

But News Channel 8 has learned that isn't his only run in with the law in the Tampa Bay area.

In February, authorities in Orange County arrested McDonald on a Hillsborough County warrant on charges of obtaining a vehicle with intent to defraud and false drivers license.

According to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, the warrant was generated by Tampa International Airport Police.

He's due in court on that case in Tampa on Thursday morning.

Then, there is the matter in New Jersey where McDonald is a wanted man. According to a news release put out in September by the South Brunswick Police Department, he is a suspect in a string of vehicle burglaries.

Pasco deputies were aware of the warrant when they arrested him in January, but according to the arrest report, the case was non-extraditable, essentially meaning the crime didn't warrant holding McDonald and transporting him back to race those charges.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pasco-county/orlando-bad-bunny-s-checkered-past-in-tampa-bay-area/1947796974,2019-04-23T21:00:54Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1268,Man accused of burning girlfriend's son also faces molestation charge,"<p>A man who was arrested Sunday on an aggravated child abuse charge after his girlfriend's son was seriously burned while in his care now faces a molestation charge for a separate incident, authorities said.</p>

<p>According to an arrest report, a 6-year-old girl was interviewed by detectives Monday and said that Khalil Jabali, 23, touched her vagina over her clothing while she was lying on her mother's bed at their home in Miami Gardens.</p>

<p>Police said the incident occurred when the victim was 5.</p>

<p>During the interview, the girl was able to make a distinction between the truth and a lie, authorities said.</p>

<p>Local 10 News is withholding the relationship between Jabli and the victim to protect the child's identity.</p>

<p>Jabali remains in custody at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center.</p>

<p>According to a police report, Jabali was watching his girlfriend's three children Sunday while she was at work when the woman's 4-year-old son was burned by hot water that had been boiled in the microwave.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Police said Jabali called his girlfriend to tell her that the boy had wet his bed and was burned by hot water that he left in the bathroom when her younger child started crying.</p>

<p>Explaining that he had boiled water in the microwave so he could wash the boy's wet clothes, Jabali told police he left a bowl of hot water on the bathroom sink while he was in another room checking on the other child. When he returned to the bathroom, Jabali said he found the boy on the floor moaning and his skin peeling off.</p>

<p>The boy's mother left work and, along with Jabali, took her son to Jackson North Medical Center. He was then transferred to the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.</p>

<p>Police said the boy had burns to 15 percent of his body.</p>

<p>""They do not know if he is going to survive, and if he does he will likely be in a vegetative state,"" a prosecutor told Miami-Dade County Judge Renatha Francis during Jabali's bond hearing Monday morning.</p>

<p>Police said the boy had other injuries, including bleeding around the brain and the chest cavity and broken ribs. </p>

<p>The prosecutor said paramedics were never called.</p>

<p>Francis initially set Jabali's bond at $10,000. She also ordered him to remain on house arrest upon his release and to stay at least 500 feet away from the child.</p>

<p>However, Jabali reappeared in court Tuesday, at which time Francis ordered him held without bond due to the new charge. He was also ordered to have no contact with either victim. </p>",https://www.local10.com/news/florida/miami-dade/man-accused-of-burning-girlfriends-son-also-faces-molestation-charge,2019-04-23T14:53:15Z,WPLG,"3401 W Hallandale Beach Blvd, Pembroke Park, FL 33023, USA",FL,33023

1278,Rosanne Cash remembers and it rings true | Music Roundup,"Rosanne Cash’s latest album, “She Remembers Everything,” is the fierce and tender soundtrack of a woman claiming her power — all of it, the accumulated power of the past and the ancestors, the power of lovers and children and broken dreams and hard roads, the power of the breaking and mending of a heart, over and over.

“There is a woman’s real life, complex experiences and layered understanding in these songs,” Cash said of the 2018 release. “I could not have written them 10 years ago — not even close. Time is shorter, I have more to say.”

Boy, does she ever. Cash is a survivor. She has survived the hazards of fame — that of her father Johnny Cash and stepmother June Carter Cash, that of her first husband Rodney Crowell and that of her own fame, which plunged her into the meatgrinder maw of the Nashville music machine before she finally fled to New York City, where she now lives with husband John Leventhal.

Cash has survived addiction, a bitter divorce (that, after the dust settled, yielded an enduring and fond friendship with Crowell) and the loss of father, stepmother and mother all within the span of two years. Most recently, she survived brain surgery to treat a rare condition responsible for decades of debilitating headaches.

Rosanne Cash will perform at Opening Nights at 7:30 p.m. Saturday in Ruby Diamond Concert Hall. (Photo: Rick Diamond)

All along, she has spun the dross of her life into gleaming gold on such albums as “Seven Year Ache,” “King’s Record Shop,” “Interiors,” “The Wheel,” “Black Cadillac” and “The River and the Thread.”

And, now, on “She Remembers Everything,” an album that will ring like a great bell of truth to those of us of a certain age, those who’ve run out of damns to give and have discovered the freedom and power that conveys. And such is the musical and lyrical power of Cash’s flinty, unflinching and graceful songwriting that the album will ring true for anyone with open ears and an open heart.

The album’s central anthem is “Everyone But Me,” which was almost an afterthought, according to an interview with NPR.

“I had written these lyrics in my notebook and just kept them for myself, and didn't think it could be a song — I thought it was too raw to be a song,” Cash said. “And then John (Leventhal) and I were recording in the studio one day, and we hit a wall, and he said, ‘What else you got, kid?’

“I felt like when I lost my parents, I didn't really lose them yet — for better and for worse. You spend a long time extricating yourself from trauma, and there's both and love and rage, and it's not just me. That's a universal feeling, I think.”

She sings:

“Mother and father, now that you’re gone,

It’s not nearly long enough,

Still it seems too long;

I gave up my name for you,

Gave up my edge, it made me bleed,

And I pleased everyone,

I mean, everyone but me;

There behind the closing door,

I’m not enough and then too much,

Our strange and beautiful lives

Fade and turn to dust.

It’s all there - gold from dross, treasure from pain, the bittersweet rewards of enduring.

Cash and her band will perform that song and others from “She Remembers Everything,” as well as songs from an upcoming musical version of “Norma Rae” that she’s writing with Leventhal and hits from throughout her career to close the Opening Nights season at 7:30 p.m. Saturday in Ruby Diamond Concert Hall. Tickets are $65, $55, $45 and $25 general public, $32, $27, $22 and $12 students. Visit openingnights.fsu.edu.

1281,Lawyers fight day-long battle to prove Indian River lawmen butchered prostitution cases,"CLOSE Vero Beach police Detective Sgt. Phil Huddy discusses conditions inside massage parlors Tuesday, Feb. 26, 2019, in Indian River County. Patrick Dove, patrick.dove@tcpalm.com

Could Treasure Coast prosecutors lose the ability to use as evidence videos law enforcement recorded allegedly showing hundreds of men having sex with prostitutes in Asian day spas?

If so, it could affect cases against hundreds of alleged johns, prostitutes and brothel operators charged after an investigation over the winter.

About 20 attorneys representing more than 90 defendants spent more than 10 hours in three hearings Tuesday and Wednesday in Indian River and Martin counties arguing why the videos should be excluded.

Friday in Palm Beach County, attorneys for Robert Kraft will make their own arguments why videos recorded inside Orchids of Asia spa in Jupiter that led to prostitution charges against the New England Patriots owner should be excluded from the case.

After reviewing dozens of pages of documents and sitting through more than eight hours of testimony and arguments at the Indian River County Courthouse — the overwhelming majority presented by the defense — here are some takeaways about a portion of the case.

More: Human trafficking or prostitution? The Treasure Coast story from Day 1

PRE-WARRANT INVESTIGATIONS: In probes of four spas across the region, law enforcement conducted thorough surveillance and investigation of the spas before getting court orders to install cameras.

Indian River County Sheriff's Office Sgt. John Finnegan testified Tuesday April 23, 2019, in Indian River County Court about how he obtained a court order to install hidden cameras in the ceiling of East Sea Spa near Sebastian. (Photo: LAURENCE REISMAN/TCPALM)

Detectives spoke with numerous men who walked out of the spas and said they got massages, then were sexually stimulated by hand for a fee. Detectives searched trash and found proof of the sex.

Few, if any, women entered these businesses.

Based on surveillance and testimony from health department inspectors, it appeared spa workers were living in the businesses, often a sign of human trafficking. Detectives also found websites promoting prostitution at these spas.

Law enforcement’s reasonable hypothesis: The spas were at least brothels where one or more people were making a living off prostitution.

Lawmen said indoor video surveillance was needed to prove cases of money laundering or racketeering (multiple cases of “deriving of funds from the proceeds of prostitution”).

Defense attorneys argued detectives were required to try less-invasive techniques — tapping phones, putting tracking devices on vehicles, etc. — to prove their cases.

SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT: The Vero Beach Police Department’s operation at East Spa on 14th Avenue was the most extensive and yielded the most arrests.

The VBPD is the only agency to report it is sheltering a woman who says she was forced into sexual bondage.

On Tuesday, its detectives explained the lengths they went to try and prove its case before seeking what’s called a “sneak and peek” warrant.

It included sending in twice an undercover officer, who testified he was propositioned both times after a massage. The second time, he said, the masseuse was so aggressive she rubbed his private parts and forcibly gave him a kiss on his mouth.

Indian River County sheriff’s detectives said they did not use an undercover officer at East Sea Spa in Roseland because they thought it was too risky.

In Vero Beach, Detective Sean Crowley testified U.S. Homeland Security Investigations installed cameras inside and outside the spa so officers could see and record massage rooms and the front office. They rented the strip mall unit next door, inserting cameras through ceiling tiles after getting workers out of the spa by creating an electric problem ruse.

The Sheriff’s Office, whose officers said they used their own equipment that could videotape only one room or four rooms, created a similar ruse to get the cameras inside. Detectives watched the action from sheriff's headquarters.

KEY DEFENSE ISSUES

MONITOR OR RECORD? In Indian River County, Vero Beach and sheriff's detectives filed affidavits, signed by judges, requesting warrants to monitor and record ""visual non-audio conduct.""

But, as attorney Andrew Metcalf noted Tuesday, orders signed by judges allowed installation and monitoring of the cameras. There was no mention of “recording.”

Buy Photo Larry Reisman (Photo: PATRICK DOVE/TCPALM)

Thus, said Metcalf, who led arguments for dozens of defendants and lawyers before county judges David Morgan and Nicole Menz, the recordings were illegal and should not be allowed as evidence.

The real question is whether the inconsistency is material. Were defendants’ Fourth Amendment rights to unreasonable search and seizure or state rights to privacy violated by the recording? Does the recording merely memorialize evidence detectives saw, or is there more at play?

What was the intent of the judges who signed the warrants and affidavits?

WHAT DID DETECTIVES SEE? Did they watch or record too much activity over the course of more than a month? The order they obtained requires them to ""minimize the invasion of privacy"" to anyone not acting illegally.

In most cases, detectives said they watched massages until the end, because that’s when the illegal acts almost always took place.

More: Palm Beach County officials sued for alleged invasion of privacy over tapes

Testimony suggested Vero Beach’s cameras ran 24/7 but were monitored only certain hours. The sheriff had a smaller operation, but, in many cases, recorded all massage rooms at one time. That was a problem, Metcalf said, because in one video he saw, a woman receiving a legal massage was recorded.

Morgan even asked deputies to explain a camera setup that videotaped innocent patrons and prostitution activity at the same time.

Detective Andrew Dean testified there were only four legal massages viewed compared to 63 illegal acts in the 13 days of the recordings.

In Vero Beach, only three of more than 100 massages were legal, Crowley said.

In Palm Beach County, almost three dozen people last week sued police and prosecutors for violating their privacy by videotaping them getting massages.

“This is more invasive than wire-tapping,” Metcalf said, suggesting police knew people would get naked. He said he could think of no more private a place other than a marital bedroom or bathroom.

More: Sports Illustrated offers a legal analysis of the case against Robert Kraft

We'll learn more next week when Martin County Judge Kathleen Roberts is expected to rule on some cases argued Wednesday. Indian River County judges gave lawyers more time to file memorandums on the issues.

These should be close calls given that surreptitious videotaping is rarely used in our area and there is no specific state statute authorizing it. Some of the related cases used in arguments have to do with wire-tapping law.

Assistant State Attorney Ryan Butler, who remained quiet most of the hearings, said enacting a surreptitious videotaping statute would be useful. He's right.

Robert Stone, a former state attorney who has some clients in the case, is hopeful the evidence will be tossed. But, he said, judges often are loathe to toss key evidence in high-profile cases like this.

1287,Learning to create my own future,"What I want people to know about me is that I try to live happy and not let things get me down.

I’ve learned that the person who controls my happiness and decides what to do about circumstances that get in the way is me.

Although I have lived here all my life with various relatives, I didn’t have a home of my own. Later, I realized how that affected my focus and purpose.

Growing up, my big brother and I lived with our great-grandmother. My parents had health and addiction problems. Grandma died when I was in the fifth grade, and we went to stay with our dad’s mother and other extended family.

Dad was around off and on, but we didn’t see much of Mom. I learned later that she was trying to get treatment for scleroderma.

I enjoyed elementary school, but my life lacked structure during those years. In middle school I made some poor choices and was with a bad crowd. I had to leave my grandmother’s house.

Dad’s condition was deteriorating and he couldn’t provide a place to stay. Luckily, Mom was doing better. She got a room for us at an inexpensive hotel near where my brother, who always was my grounding person, was staying with friends. The three of us were the closest we ever had been.

It was an improvement, but I still was depressed and anxious about our temporary situation. In my sophomore year I dropped out of Venice High School.

When Mom found a house for us, for the first time I was able to sit and think about my future. I decided I did not want to be poor my whole life.

I went back to school, put my heart into doing well, and graduated early.

The APEX (learning program for students at risk of dropping out) teachers really helped me and so did my big sister through Big Brothers/Big Sisters.

A Suncoast Technical College counselor helped with FAFSA and described the LPN bridge program that transitions to the RN program at State College of Florida. My long-term goal is to be a pediatric nurse or patient consultant.

Meanwhile, I walk to my job at a diner and to see friends who want me to do makeovers. It’s fun and I’ve gotten good at makeovers in every sense.

Currently I’m reading “The Glass Castle.” It’s about a woman who succeeded despite her dysfunctional family.

I am looking ahead, not behind, and determined to make that my story, too.

1288,Legal drama in manslaughter case against East Naples man continues with discovery violation,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

The legal drama in the case against an East Naples man, accused of drunken and drugged driving and killing a woman in a 2014 crash, continued Tuesday, months after a mistrial.

The attorneys for Kiereek Seymour, 29, told the judge that the prosecution did not disclose versions of a crash report.

Seymour, of East Naples, was charged with DUI manslaughter after a crash at Lakewood and Davis boulevards in East Naples on May 19, 2014.

A February trial ended in a mistrial after a juror came out of the jury room during deliberations and indicated she was feeling uncomfortable. A new trial began Monday with jury selection.

Defense Attorney Peter Adrien filed a motion to dismiss the case Tuesday morning after discovering a version of a Florida traffic crash report that Seymour’s defense team had not previously seen.

More: East Naples man back in court to face DUI manslaughter charge after February mistrial

The report listed Seymour as traveling within the posted speed limit and Maddux traveling 20 mph over the speed limit, according to the motion.

The report was put together by lead investigator Officer Adam Rivera, of the Florida Highway Patrol, according to the motion.

Rivera and Officer John Benton, also of the Florida Highway Patrol, concealed the information in the preliminary crash report from Seymour’s defense team, the motion states.

The speeds of the drivers were different in the finalized crash report, according to the motion.

Adrien said he was able to obtain the original crash report by luck through Collier County.

""You are supposed to give us everything,” Adrien said.

The original report contradicts Benton’s claim that Seymour was driving 63 mph at the time of the crash, Adrien said.

“We went through a whole trial in this case, and that information was never given to us until yesterday from the state,” Adrien said.

As soon as Seymour’s defense team notified her of the discovery of the original crash report on Sunday, Assistant State Attorney Mara Marzano asked Benton about the documents then gathered and sent all versions of the report to the defense team Monday morning, she said.

She also did not know there were preliminary versions of the traffic crash report and had never seen the documents, Marzano said.

Collier Circuit Judge Joseph Foster denied Adrien’s motion to dismiss the case but agreed that a discovery violation by the prosecution occurred.

“Was the violation willful or merely inadvertent, based on representations here and looking through things I believe it was an inadvertent violation,"" Foster said.

""One other request that I have would be, whether they think it's relevant or not, is to give us every version of every document they have,” Adrien said.

The judge said he was going to reserve his decision on what sort of relief would be provided to Seymour’s defense team until they could talk with their traffic reconstruction expert.

Before opening statements began in the case Tuesday morning, the court had to address that a juror was having a medical issue.

Foster released the juror, who was dealing with an eye infection. There is one alternative and six jurors left on the panel.

Marzano began her opening statement by explaining that Maddux had caffeine in her system at the time of the crash with Seymour.

Evidence in the case would show Seymour had alcohol and Alprazolam in his system, which created an additive effect and rendered him impaired at the time of the crash, Marzano told the jurors.

""At the conclusion of hearing all the evidence, the state is confident you will find the defendant was driving while impaired by both drugs, Alprazolam, and alcohol and that he did contribute to this crash that killed Sandra Maddux,” Marzano said.

Defense Attorney Ian Richards began by telling the jurors that what attorneys say is not evidence.

The evidence will show that the only legal blood-alcohol test done after the crash showed Seymour was under 0.08, the legal limit for driving, Richards said.

It will also show that the more evidence law enforcement collected in the case, the worse it got as far as having a case against Seymour, Richards said.

""Pay attention to the evidence in the case as it comes from the witness stand and as it comes from the individuals that testify,” Richards told the jurors. “Look for the evidence, and the evidence alone, and don't be swayed by feelings that don't come from the evidence in this case.”

The trial, which began Monday, is expected to last nine days.

The state attorney's office refiled the DUI manslaughter charge in 2016 after then-Collier Circuit Judge Fred Hardt vacated an earlier plea agreement in the case.

The negotiated plea agreement related to charges stemming from a Marco Island crash and charges from the crash involving Maddux.

An East Naples man, accused of driving under the influence and killing a woman in a 2014 crash, was back in court Monday after a mistrial was declared in February.

Kiereek Seymour, 29, of East Naples, was charged with DUI manslaughter after an early morning crash at Lakewood and Davis boulevards in East Naples on May 19, 2014. He remains in jail.

Sandra Marie Maddux, 54, of East Naples, died from injuries suffered in the crash.

Circuit Judge Joseph Foster declared the mistrial after a juror came out of the jury room during deliberations and indicated she was feeling uncomfortable. The new trial is expected to last nine days, the length of the February trial, Foster said Monday.

More: East Naples man Kiereek Seymour back in court in 2014 DUI, pursuit case

Six jurors and two alternatives were selected Monday, and opening statements from the defense and prosecution are expected to begin at 9 a.m. Tuesday.

February’s trial centered around conflicting assertions about whether Seymour was driving, which driver was at fault in the crash and whether Seymour's blood alcohol content was above .08, the legal limit for driving.

Even before February’s mistrial, Seymour had been in court before to face charges related to the crash that killed Maddux.

The state attorney's office refiled the DUI manslaughter charge in 2016 after then-Collier Circuit Judge Fred Hardt vacated an earlier plea agreement.

The negotiated plea agreement related to charges stemming from a Marco Island crash and charges from the crash involving Maddux. Hardt wrote that he had to vacate all sentences in the two cases.

At a hearing in June 2016, Seymour’s attorneys argued that the officer’s sirens were not activated during the pursuit of Seymour in the Marco Island incident, court documents show.

In an August 2016 order to vacate the sentence, Hardt agreed with Seymour’s attorneys, writing that “the officer’s dash cam clearly demonstrates that his siren was not activated.”

Seymour was back at the Collier County Courthouse in April 2018 for a jury trial to face charges in the Marco Island incident.

After deliberating for four hours and returning for four more hours on a second day, six jurors found Seymour guilty on all charges related to the Marco Island incident on April 27, 2018.

However, in May 2018, Seymour was granted a new trial in that case after testimony revealed jurors found a law book left behind in the jury room and used it to deliberate.

The book had been left behind by a bailiff who was studying for the sergeant’s exam, the bailiff testified during the hearing in which Seymour was granted a new trial.

The new jury trial for the charges related to the Marco Island incident was postponed after the mistrial was declared in Seymour’s February trial.

1292,"'He will be missed': Pensacola man killed in crash was aspiring rapper, loving dad","A 22-year-old Pensacola man killed on Easter in a suspected drunken driving crash is being remembered as a budding musician, loving father and devoted brother.

Nelson Riley was killed Sunday afternoon when authorities say a driver failed to stop at a red light and rammed her vehicle into the car driven by Riley's father.

The suspected drunken driver, Marie Ann Simpkins, ​​​​​​has been charged with vehicular homicide; driving under the influence – manslaughter; driving under the influence – serious bodily injury; and reckless driving causing serious bodily injuries, according to the State Attorney's Office.

Nelson Riley's older brother, Randy Riley Jr., had just left St. John Divine Baptist Church — the second of two church services he attended Sunday with his girlfriend — when he answered his cellphone and learned of the wreck.

""We left and went to get something to eat. That's when I got the call and heard my brother and dad were in a really bad crash,"" said Randy Riley Jr., 26. “My heart started beating fast. I was only told that my brother was dead once we were at the hospital.”

The siblings' father, Randy Riley Sr., 49, remained in critical condition at Baptist Hospital as of Monday afternoon.

The crash happened shortly before 4:30 p.m. Sunday. Randy Riley Sr. was driving a Ford Mustang southbound on North W Street toward West Fairfield Drive when authorities said Simpkins, who was driving east on Fairfield, ran the red light at the intersection.

Simpkins' Hyundai Sonata collided with the Mustang and also with a Nissan Murano driven by Gladys Taylor, 35, of Pensacola.

Nelson Riley was pronounced dead at the scene, according to FHP.

Simpkins and her two passengers — Jobe Simpkins, 19, and Jayceon Wiggins, 4 — were all transported to Baptist Hospital and have since been treated and released. Taylor's condition was not immediately available Monday.

'He will be missed'

Nelson Riley's passion was rap, according to his siblings.

Randy Riley Jr. said he and his younger brother grew up making music together. He said his younger brother listened to his rap music in their parents' living room and wanted to be like him.

“I introduced him to it,” Randy Riley Jr. said. “I used to rap when I was younger. … He wanted to rap too, then.”

Nelson Riley was also a dedicated father to 2-year-old Nel'Monie Riley, according to his family.

""He loved her. She was his everything,"" said Nelson Riley's sister, Jamina Riley, 27.

She said her little brother was dedicated to making music and performed locally under the rap alias of “Retro."" His lyrics often focused on “growing up in the struggle” and perseverance through hard times, she said.

“He was always about his music,” she said. “And, he was always loving on his daughter, taking her to the park and other places just like that.”

Another brother, Jaquan Riley, 25, described his late brother as humble and knowledgeable beyond his years.

""He always told me just the right thing to make it through, so I could make it through a bad situation,” he said. ""He will be missed.""

A Fort Myers man is facing attempted second-degree homicide charges, the result of a Friday afternoon shooting that involved a standoff with police.

Fort Myers Police on Monday said Markqueon Sharif Pearson, 21, was arrested and charged in the shooting of Eugene Bouie, 57, at 2080 Fountain Street.

He remains in Lee County Jail on $300,000 bond and will be arraigned May 20.

Bouie, who suffered a non-life-threatening wound, was treated at Lee Memorial Hospital and released.

Throughout that afternoon, police had swarmed and yelled through loudspeakers for those involved to leave the boarding house, at 2081 Fountain Street, near Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Dunbar, with their hands up.

Teams of heavily-armed police had set up a perimeter around the neighborhood, monitoring it.

Police said Pearson fled to the boarding house after the shooting, and they had evacuated tenants. Onlookers stood outside filming with their phones until a downpour moved in, lasting about an hour.

About three hours after Bouie was shot Friday, police used a battering ram to go into the boarding house. Then they sent in a drone.

Not quite an hour later, police arrested Pearson, a boarder at the Fountain Street address, after he was identified using security video.

1297,"Woman brings truck in for service, dealership takes it shopping, she 'steals' it back","FLOWOOD, Miss. - A woman who brought her truck in for service was shocked to later see it being taken shopping by a dealership employee.

But she had the last laugh as she ""stole"" her truck back in the store parking lot.

Last week, Penny Ivy Thompson brought the truck she calls ""Big Bertha"" to the Mac Haik dealership in Flowood, Mississippi, the Clarion Ledger reported.

But a short time later, she saw the truck on the highway and thought it may have just been a test drive. However, because it was tailgating another car, she decided to follow to see what was going on.

Thompson followed her truck with the dealership employee inside another two miles to a Lowe's store. As she waited in the parking lot while the employee was inside, Thompson called the dealership to ask if they knew were her truck was.

Then Thompson found her spare key and took her own truck back, leaving the employee without a way back.

Thompson drove back to the dealership to confront management and was told she'd get free service, as long as she didn't post the story to social media.

That didn't happen.

""Do not mess with my family, my animals, my money, or my truck. Nobody drives Big Bertha like that. Nobody."" she posted to Facebook.

The dealership later posted a full apology and said the employee had been fired and the service manager was suspended.

1311,'She was beautiful and she was good': Family mourns 8-year-old killed in storm,"WOODVILLE — Good Friday was supposed to be a fun day off, a ""cheat day"" for Joe Weinman and his four kids.

School was out for the district-wide spring holiday, and while his wife Sara had to work, he had time off from his job at Crickets Tree Service, too. A line of fast-moving thunderstorms coming through that morning were to give way to a beautiful day.

“I was happy. I was sitting there thinking, the fishing poles are in the shed,"" said Weinman, ""I was thinking, 'Well great, I’ve got a cheat day.' We had really big plans for Sunday morning for Easter.”

Normally, 8-year-old Mariah Juliette Weinman and her two brothers — 14-year-old Kyle and 12-year-old Austin — would have been on their way at about 8 a.m. to Woodville's combined elementary and middle school. Instead they sat on the couch inside the Old Woodville Road mobile home they shared with their parents and 20-year-old sister, Kayla, waiting for the storms to pass.

""I just heard a crack,"" Joe Wineman recalled. ""A branch hit outside near our little fire pit near the house, then the whole house just imploded.""

An oak tree had crashed through their roof. Inside the mobile home, there was chaos, insulation flying everywhere.

“I just started yelling everybody’s name,” Joe said. “The first one to answer was Kyle, then Kayla. Austin came out of his room then stopped because everything was broken. Then I started screaming for Mariah.”

The second-grader wasn't there.

The yells of a neighbor sank Joe’s heart. He rushed out the back door and found his daughter's body. She'd been propelled out of the house by a giant limb.

Joe carried his youngest daughter to his truck tailgate as medical officials arrived and whisked her away to the hospital.

Miles away in Monticello, Sara, in a panic, rushed to get home, trying to start her car's push-button ignition with a key before a co-worker gave her a ride. On the way, she made desperate phone calls trying to find out what happened to her daughter.

“I can’t put the words to what I was going through,” Sara said. “One minute, I was terrified. The next minute I was hoping and praying, please let everything be all right.”

At the hospital, exuberant, intelligent Mariah was pronounced dead, killed by the impact.

“I kept hoping there would be some miracle in the back of the ambulance,” Joe Weinman said. “I think I already knew.”

‘A sassy little 8-year-old’

On Easter, instead of meeting as planned with more than a dozen family members at Lake Bradford for a kayaking trip and picnic, they met on the beach in St. Marks to light candles and watch the sunset.

Everyone wore pink, Mariah’s favorite color.

Her family called her “Roo.” She was a bubbly, adventurous and fearless kid, her parents said, inseparable from her siblings. She did well in school and was recognized for her citizenship both at Woodville and Springwood Elementary, her previous schools.

Like her mother, Mariah loved the '80s heavy metal hair band Motley Cru. She rocked out to their blaring tunes on brightly-colored Jojo Siwa headphones.

“Our 8-year-old daughter is sitting there, listening to 'Dr. Feelgood' and 'Smoking in the Boys Room,' because she’ s mom’s girl and she’s going to get into everything that mom loves,” Joe said.

“I’m sure they would be proud,"" Sara chimed in, “I’m proud.”

Her parents described Mariah as a fearless, fun, all-in kid.

“She’s just a sassy little 8-year-old,” Joe said.

When her older siblings didn’t want to ride roller coasters at Wild Adventures in Valdosta, Mariah was first in line next to her dad.

“She was on every single adult roller coaster that she could get on. In the front seat,” Sara said. “Came off smiling.”

When she was younger, she came up with the word “shwaybie” to describe Disney princesses, but the funny sounding word came to mean different things depending on her tone. She used it when she was happy and when she was upset. It showed her silly, sweet side.

“She was beautiful and she was good,” Sara said. “Everybody that knew her is going to remember her that way.""

'We need them just as much as they need us'

In the days since their daughter’s death, financial help, condolences and support from the community has been overwhelming — but appreciated. A GoFund me page has raised more than $17,000.

“It’s just unreal, you can’t put the words to it how much these people we don’t even know, now it feels like they’re all somewhat a part of us in a sense,” Sara said. “How do we express that much thanks?”

As a tree service worker, Joe found himself helping grieving people who felt hopeless in tornadoes in both Hurricanes Hermine and Michael.

This time his co-workers came to his aid.

“I said, I can’t start moving forward until that tree is out of my house. They looked at me and said, ‘It’s done,’” he said.

After they cleared the tree and the family’s personal belongings from the demolished house, the men came to the hospital to pay their respects and let the Weinmans know they had a clean slate to begin making sense of what happened.

“I don’t know now if I know what to do,"" Joe said. “In some small way, I’m really glad that the house is destroyed because I don’t want to go back in there.”

But the Weinmans don't plan on leaving Woodville.

“This is home, our family is here. I need the friends at work. I need the friends who are going to cry with me and understand. We need them just as much as they need us,"" he said.

Their sons are trying to come to grips with the death of their sister. They were there when the tree came through and at the hospital when doctors solemnly announced they couldn’t save Mariah. They wanted to go back to school and be with friends.

“Our biggest thing now is we do have to parent. We have three kids that need us.”

'One day at a time'

Four days after Mariah's death, families gathered at Woodville Elementary School Tuesday evening for the end of year Spring Music Program.

Mariah’s family sat in the first row watching while the children performed. First graders sang about colors, second graders about animals. Sara and Joe smiled through their tears.

During intermission, Woodville principal Dr. Lisa Mehr asked for a moment of silence and presented the family with pink flowers to plant in their yard along with an envelope full of cards made by Mariah’s peers.

When Mariah's second grade class began singing, Sara wiped away her tears, rested her head on her husband’s shoulder and rubbed Austin’s back. They listened to the songs Mariah had been practicing.

At every turn, there is a feeling she should be there.

“She’s everywhere. We went to the Waffle House,” Joe said tearfully. ""I’m not supposed to tell those people (table for) five. I’m supposed to tell them six.”

A week after Mariah's death, her parents' emotions swing like a pendulum. Memories of family times bring laughter and tears. They are still living in a hotel and haven't yet figured out where they will put down new roots.

They are working to get to Saturday, when Mariah's funeral will be held.

“We’re trying to get through this week,” Sara said. “We’ll just take it one day at a time.”

VERO BEACH — At ages 95 and 89 respectively, Albert and Donna LaBonte have done a lot of living.

The couple, who have been married for more than 50 years and been business owners in Vero Beach for decades, have finally decided it’s time to retire.

On April 30, the couple will close their electrical repair and fixture business, Candlelite, on Old Dixie Highway, and plan to spend their free time on projects around their own home.

The shop has been a fixture in Vero Beach, repairing and selling lamps and other electrical items, as well as lampshades.

It’s not the first time the LaBontes have tried retirement. About 14 years ago, they closed their shop on Royal Palm Pointe and planned to enjoy a slower pace of life.

But that retirement lasted for about a month, Albert LaBonte said.

(Photo: PATRICK DOVE/TCPALM)

“We started getting cabin fever,” he joked. “So we looked around and found this place on Old Dixie Highway and figured we’d work another five or six years.”

That five or six years turned into 14, which Donna LaBonte describes as a pleasure, mostly due to customers who have returned time and time again.

“We really enjoyed this business,” Donna LaBonte said. “We’ve met such nice people; it has been a pleasure to serve them at the shop.”

More:Photos from Vero Beach Easter Parade 2019

One of those customers, Judy Orcutt of Vero Beach, said she has shopped at Candlelite for years, including at their previous location on Royal Palm Pointe.

""I just happened to stop by for a lampshade and learned that they are going out of business,"" said Orcutt, in an email to the TCPalm newsroom. ""The couple who has run it forever are always so upbeat and cheerful. The woman told me her husband is close to 100 and she is right behind.""

The LaBontes moved to Vero Beach in 1979 from South Florida, where they owned a shopping center in Palm Beach Gardens. When they sold the property for the eventual construction of “Golden Bear Plaza,” they headed north to Vero Beach, purchased a home and continued their electrical contracting business they had operated in Palm Beach Gardens.

Selling lighting fixtures was almost an accidental business for the LaBontes, who turned a spare bedroom in their home into a showroom.

“When I was doing electrical work at new homes, people would pick out fixtures but the order would never come in,” said Albert LaBonte. “So I decided to buy the fixtures, put them up in my house and people could come and pick out what they wanted. Then I knew I would have them.”

Albert LaBonte was a fighter pilot in World War II and Donna also earned her pilot’s license. Neither flies any more but both still have driver’s licenses. It’s Donna who’s doing most of the driving these days. Their health is relatively good — neither has seen a doctor since the 1980s — but despite some aches and pains, they’ve continued to work six days a week.

If there’s a secret to a successful, long business career and marriage, Albert LaBonte said it’s two things — moderation and a sense of humor.

“Most of the people know about my sense of humor,” said Albert LaBonte. “They come in and ask me if I have a new joke for them. I figure I’d rather have them laughing with me than at me.”

Candlelite is having a “going out of business sale"" with inventory being sold at greatly reduced prices.

But when April 30 rolls around, the store will close and whatever hasn’t sold will head off to thrift stores. Coincidentally, April 30 is also the day Albert LaBonte turns 96.

“We’ve been working at this for 60 years,” he said. “People are always asking me what we’re going to be doing next. And the answer is always the same — very little.”

1314,Why One Week Boutique is a destination for parents looking for savings on children's items,"One Week Boutique, a seasonal consignment sale of gently used baby and children's clothes, toys and more, takes place between April 26 to April 28 at the Civic Center. (Photo: One Week Boutique)

Jennifer Taylor was living in Alabama when she learned about a consignment sale for gently used baby and children's items. She raved about it to her good friend, Sara Barber, and her sister. Tallahassee needs one of those, they thought.

That was 13 years and 26 sales ago.

The One Week Boutique, co-owned by Taylor and Barber, began with 50 consignors at the cottages at Goodwood Museum & Gardens and later moved to the former Dillard's wing at the Centre of Tallahassee mall.

Today, it's grown to include more than 700 consignors and 60,000 to 70,000 items coming through the door every spring and fall. The next sale takes place Friday through Sunday at the Tucker Civic Center, the host site for the last six sales. There's no charge for entry or parking.

Getting the most for your money

The sale is beloved by those looking to stretch their dollars. Taylor and Barber have it down to an art. It's not uncommon to see them working on the floor.

For first-time shoppers, it seems like a gold mine. A space in the lower level of the Civic Center is crammed with items neatly organized and labeled by size and section. Rows of strollers, car seats, pack and plays, walkers, furniture and bikes greet customers to the sale.

As shoppers work their way through, they search through racks of clothes for newborns and babies, along with older kids.

Shoppers range from expecting mothers, new and seasoned parents and grandparents. More than 3,500 shoppers flood the three-day event.

""It’s pretty crazy how many people come through that place,” Taylor said.

The importance of supporting local charities

But, even with the sale's growth and success, Taylor is surprised it's still not on the radar of many residents and parents.

Consignors earn 65 to 70 percent of the sale of each item, and have the option of donating their items if they're not sold at the end of the sale. Seeing charities picking up items is Taylor's favorite part of the event.

""Our biggest takeaway for the whole event is our charities and being able to stock their closets,"" Taylor said.

Those charities include PHI Center (Pregnancy Help and Information Center), Brehon Institute, the Tallahassee Area Foster and Adoptive Parent Association, Christmas Connection, Zeta Phi Community Baby Shower, A Woman's Place, Clothed With Joy - Jefferson County and Allen Outreach with the Griffin Heights Neighborhood.

'Outfit your kids for the price of one'

Although Barber and Taylor have the consignment event down to a science, expect long lines to wrap around the perimeter of the space. Volunteers man 10 registers but the first few hours of the sale usually produces a rush.

Taylor's advice for shoppers: Be patient. It's worth it.

""If you have a lot of kids, it’s the place for you,"" she said. ""You can outfit your kids for the price of one at the mall.”

A North Port man was thrown from his vehicle and killed and four passengers, including a five-year-old girl, were injured in a crash Saturday night on U.S. 41 in North Fort Myers.

The Florida Highway patrol said the man was driving a 2000 Jeep Wrangler south on 41 near Avenue A shortly after 10 p.m.

None of those involved were identified pending the FHP's notification of next-of-kin.

The SUV continued south and hit the median curb, traveled off 41 and overturned multiple times. The Jeep ended up in a ditch and the driver was ejected from the vehicle.

A 30-year-old female passenger and the five-year-old girl, both from North Port, suffered critical injuries and were taken to Lee Memorial Hospital. Two other male juveniles, ages 8 and 11 and also from North Port, suffered minor injuries and were taken to Lee Memorial.

The FHP said the driver was not wearing a seat belt and it was unknown if the woman and the girl were wearing seat belts. The two male juveniles were wearing seat belts.

The crash remains under investigation.

The death is the 39th traffic fatality in Lee County for 2019.

1316,Woman grabs boots and machete to deal with snake,"- She was ready to kill it, but she rescued it instead.

A local woman grabbed a machete to do battle with a poisonous snake that slithered into the garage. But instead of becoming a snake assassin, she became its savior. She says this snake wouldn’t take a hint.

A neighborhood cat brought it into the yard the first time. The second time, she was going to cut off the snakes head, but then a last minute change of heart.

“Well at that point, we were like ‘Oh God’ we’ve just got to get it out here,” recalls Michelle Redfern.

Her ""you gotta be kidding me"" snake story comes with pictures to back it up.

“I had goosebumps the whole time,” Redfern said.

She used the machete as a scoop, plopped the snake into a plastic pitcher, then got in the car with it.

“I did think it was funny while we were driving to relocate it, all I could think of was what if the pitcher came open or if somebody hit us or if something happened and we had a snake in the vehicle gnawing on us apparently that’s what they do they have to latch on and gnawe,” Redfern said.

Ten minutes down the road, she released the snake into the woods. So where was the man of the house in this story? Redfern laughs that part off.

1319,"America's first female astronaut candidate, Jerrie Cobb, dies at age 88","CAPE CANAVERAL — America's first female astronaut candidate, pilot Jerrie Cobb, who pushed for equality in space but never reached its heights, has died.

Cobb died in Florida at age 88 March 18 following a brief illness. News of her death came Thursday from journalist Miles O'Brien, serving as a family spokesman.

In 1961, Cobb became the first woman to pass astronaut testing. Altogether, 13 women passed the arduous physical testing and became known as the Mercury 13. But NASA already had its Mercury 7 astronauts, all jet test pilots and all military men.

None of the Mercury 13 ever reached space, despite Cobb's testimony in 1962 before a Congressional panel.

""We seek, only, a place in our nation's space future without discrimination,"" she told a special House subcommittee on the selection of astronauts.

Instead of making her an astronaut, NASA tapped her as a consultant to talk up the space program. She was dismissed one week after commenting: ""I'm the most unconsulted consultant in any government agency.""

She wrote in her 1997 autobiography ""Jerrie Cobb, Solo Pilot,"" ''My country, my culture, was not ready to allow a woman to fly in space.""

Cobb served for decades as a humanitarian aid pilot in the Amazon jungle.

CLOSE From NASA: As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Moon missions, we prepare to take the next giant leap, with sustainable lunar missions that pave the way for eventual journeys beyond. NASA

""She should have gone to space, but turned her life into one of service with grace,"" tweeted Ellen Stofan, director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum and a former NASA scientist.

The Soviet Union ended up putting the first woman into space in 1963: Valentina Tereshkova. NASA didn't fly a woman in space — Sally Ride — until 1983.

Cobb and other surviving members of the Mercury 13 attended the 1995 shuttle launch of Eileen Collins, NASA's first female space pilot and later its first female space commander.

""Jerrie Cobb served as an inspiration to many of our members in her record breaking, her desire to go into space, and just to prove that women could do what men could do,"" said Laura Ohrenberg, headquarters manager in Oklahoma City for the Ninety-Nines Inc., an international organization of licensed women pilots.

Still hopeful, Cobb emerged in 1998 to make another pitch for space as NASA prepared to launch Mercury astronaut John Glenn — the first American to orbit the world — on shuttle Discovery at age 77.

Cobb maintained that the geriatric space study should also include an older woman.

""I would give my life to fly in space, I really would,"" Cobb told The Associated Press at age 67 in 1998. ""It's hard for me to talk about it, but I would. I would then, and I will now.""

""It just didn't work out then, and I just hope and pray it will now,"" she added.

It didn't. NASA never flew another elderly person in space, male or female.

Geraldyn Cobb was born on March 5, 1931, in Norman, Oklahoma, the second daughter of a military pilot and his wife. She flew her father's open cockpit Waco biplane at age 12 and got her private pilot's license four years later.

The Mercury 13's story is told in a recent Netflix documentary and a play based on Cobb's life, ""They Promised Her the Moon,"" is currently running in San Diego.

In her autobiography, Cobb described how she danced on the wings of her plane in the Amazon moonlight, when learning via radio on July 20, 1969, that Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had landed on the moon.

She wrote: ""Yes, I wish I were on the moon with my fellow pilots, exploring another celestial body. How I would love to see our beautiful blue planet Earth floating in the blackness of space. And see the stars and galaxies in their true brilliance, without the filter of our atmosphere. But I'm happy flying here in Amazonas, serving my brethren. 'Contenta, Senor, contenta.' (I am happy, Lord, happy.)""

Kimberly Lawson, 45, of Daytona Beach, bought a $30 Gold Rush Special Edition scratch-off game at the South Daytona Publix at 2400 South Ridgewood Avenue and immediately became one million dollars richer, according to the Florida Lottery.

Well, $700,000 richer. Before taxes. According to lottery spokesperson Lizeth George, when Lawson recently claimed the prize at the Florida Lottery Headquarters in Tallahassee she opted for the one-time, lump-sum payment.

The South Daytona Publix will receive a $2,000 bonus commission for selling the winning ticket, George said.

The special edition of the Gold Rush game, which launched in February, offers six top prizes of $15 million -- the largest prizes offered by a scratch-off game in the Florida Lottery, George said -- and 24 prizes of $1 million. The game’s overall odds of winning something are one-in-2.60. The odds of winning one of the million-dollar prizes is one-in-1,620,000, and the odds of walking home with the $15 million prize is one-in-6,480,000.

""Red touches black, friend of Jack; Red touches yellow, kill a fellow ..."" Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

Michelle Redfern's first instinct when she saw a 2-foot-long coral snake slithering in her garage Wednesday morning was to grab a machete or start the rhyme. ""Red touches Black, Friend of Jack; Red touches Yellow, Kill a Fellow ...""

""Black on yellow, deadly fellow ... Oh God, it's an actual coral snake!,"" she thought.

Her husband was barefoot and wearing boxers in the garage at her home in Magnolia Park in Melbourne.

""I grabbed my boots and machete and assessed the situation, and then I used the machete to scoop it into the pitcher,"" she said.

Redfern, owner of the popular Kona Ice shaved ice food truck, says the only time she's seen a coral snake was at a zoo.

""I spent some time in Texas, and rattlesnakes are big and scary, but I know that coral snakes don't strike,"" she said.

She actually had a turn of heart and ended up rescuing and relocating the venomous snake.

Her husband, William Navarro II, helped out, too. ""He was my driver and cameraman,"" she joked.

""We actually saved it from a neighborhood cat the second time around,"" she said. ""At which point, we felt, for the sake of both animals, we'd handle the situation. We didn't want to kill the coral snake because, being a native Florida resident, this was the first time having the opportunity to come up close and personal with such a beautiful creature.""

This particular coral snake, known as the eastern coral snake, is among the six most dangerous snakes in Florida, which has 44 species. While its bite is serious and should receive immediate medical attention, fatalities are rare. Coral snakes generally do not bite and if they do, it is often a dry bite or they inject a very low volume of venom.

It's quite rare to see one in a housing area.

""We believe that with a lot of debris being cleared from the Hibiscus Road recently, this snake may have been forced out of its natural habitat. Live and let live.""

""Red touches black, friend of Jack; Red touches yellow, kill a fellow ..."" Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

Michelle Redfern's first instinct when she saw a 2-foot-long coral snake slithering in her garage Wednesday morning was to grab a machete or start the rhyme. ""Red touches Black, Friend of Jack; Red touches Yellow, Kill a Fellow ...""

""Black on yellow, deadly fellow ... Oh God, it's an actual coral snake!,"" she thought.

Her husband was barefoot and wearing boxers in the garage at her home in Magnolia Park in Melbourne.

""I grabbed my boots and machete and assessed the situation, and then I used the machete to scoop it into the pitcher,"" she said.

Redfern, owner of the popular Kona Ice shaved ice food truck, says the only time she's seen a coral snake was at a zoo.

""I spent some time in Texas, and rattlesnakes are big and scary, but I know that coral snakes don't strike,"" she said.

She actually had a turn of heart and ended up rescuing and relocating the venomous snake.

Her husband, William Navarro II, helped out, too. ""He was my driver and cameraman,"" she joked.

""We actually saved it from a neighborhood cat the second time around,"" she said. ""At which point, we felt, for the sake of both animals, we'd handle the situation. We didn't want to kill the coral snake because, being a native Florida resident, this was the first time having the opportunity to come up close and personal with such a beautiful creature.""

This particular coral snake, known as the eastern coral snake, is among the six most dangerous snakes in Florida, which has 44 species. While its bite is serious and should receive immediate medical attention, fatalities are rare. Coral snakes generally do not bite and if they do, it is often a dry bite or they inject a very low volume of venom.

It's quite rare to see one in a housing area.

""We believe that with a lot of debris being cleared from the Hibiscus Road recently, this snake may have been forced out of its natural habitat. Live and let live.""

1330,"Letters to the Editor: April 24, 2019","Criminal trial for Sarah Heard was waste of resources

I commend the jury for recognizing what a sham the criminal prosecution of Commissioner Sarah Heard was.

It's unbelievable that the state prosecutor's office had Nita Denton lead the prosecution. An all non-Martin County prosecution team would have avoided any perception of a vendetta, given that Heard and Denton were both members of the Martin County GOP organization for years.

Buy Photo Martin County Commissioner Sarah Heard (right) talks with her attorneys (from left) Jordan Wagner and Barbara Kibbey Wagner, as they prepared for jury selection in Heard's misdemeanor trial at the Martin County Courthouse on April 8, 2019, in Stuart. Heard was found not guilty on two misdemeanor counts of violating public records laws. (Photo: ERIC HASERT/TCPALM)

Commissioner Heard deserved the public embarrassment she went through. However, I wholeheartedly approve of the verdict. A state ethics commission investigation would have been far more appropriate. We have a free and open elections process for ridding ourselves of officials who are caught in breaches of integrity short of felonies or severe misdemeanors.

Aggressive criminal prosecution of polarizing elected officials over minor violations that public officials around the state commit every day is a waste of resources. It also borders on Bolshevism.

Chuck Winn, Stuart

Compared to President Trump, Obama was a saint

I would like to agree with Pat Parker (Letter, April 1) that Carl Hiaasen’s characterization of President Obama as a “Boy Scout” was erroneous; compared to the current president, he’s more like a saint. Imagine, being married to the same woman without being adulterous. Yes, it does take just a smidgeon of character, which leaves the current president out.

Was Obama perfect? Of course not, but he has a thousand miles of decency between him and the current president.

Parker goes through three whole “lies” that Obama told, somehow missing the daily lies coming from the current president’s mouth. One of these “lies” was about the Benghazi tragedy; evidently, Parker missed the eight Republican investigations and the millions spent to find out it was a just that, a tragedy.

As for lying, the current president has established himself as someone who, if he said his name was “Donald J. Trump”; you would be entirely justified in asking for identification. Come on, he lied about where his father was born! He did it as easily as he breathes. But Parker’s standards evidently only come into focus when it comes to Obama.

Then, Parker goes into Obama’s school records, something that has never been asked of any president. But I get it. He, being black, couldn’t have gotten into a nice school unless he was given loads of help and, in Parker’s mind, was admitted solely on his race. Never mind that Obama was editor of that sophomoric rag, The Harvard Law Review. He probably got that, too, because he was black.

But again, back to the current president, a man who threatened his schools with lawsuits should they reveal his grades. As the current president once said, “What’s he got to hide?”

In the current president’s case, everything!

Joseph Desmond, Vero Beach

U.S. needs effort like Manhattan Project to build southern wall

With no help from Congress, and the judicial branch, including the Supreme Court, blocking all proposals by the Trump administration to be able to handle the onslaught of illegal asylum seekers and criminals, it is time for President Trump to take a more direct action. To keep from sending more personnel, and building more facilities to handle the number of people and to let the influx go unchecked, the wall is essential to focus the points of entry.

It is reported that the old fences are being replaced with a more substantial fence and new fence is being built, but not at the rate required to get the situation under control. Just as the United States did in WWII, we need a ""Manhattan Project.”

To educate those who are too young and others, this was a project that was needed to build the facilities to produce the atomic bomb before the Germans. Gen. Leslie Groves of the Army Corps of Engineers was appointed to the job of organizing and building the facilities and infrastructure required to produce such a weapon based upon ongoing research in the late 1930s.

From 1940, in less than five years, the feat was accomplished, and you know the results; it ended WWII in mid-1945. If we did that massive project in less than five years, surely with the proper leader and within the military budget we could build the necessary wall in two years.

What are traffic light cameras for?

Why was taxpayer money spent on traffic light cameras?

I was in a car accident and falsely given a ticket because a witness claimed I went through a red light. When I called the traffic department the very next day to get a copy of the accident report — and prove the light was green for me — I was advised that not only are the cameras not monitored but they don’t record!

If they recorded for a week or some period of time, they could be a source of revenue for the city/county from individuals/insurance companies requesting a copy. And even more vital, they would be an aid to law enforcement for Amber Alerts, Silver Alerts (e.g., Susy Tomassi’s disappearance), and as a crime-solving tool.

Currently, the Indian River Shores Public Safety Department utilizes a license plate reader system (cameras), which the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office and the Vero Beach Police Department can access if a crime has been committed in their jurisdiction and there is reason to believe a suspect has fled to Indian River Shores.

Wouldn’t the current traffic light cameras be just as effective to identify suspects of criminal activity in the county?

What purpose do these traffic light cameras serve?

1332,A jailhouse 'Carmen': Opera Naples brings the novelist's perspective to its grand opera look,"Opera Naples Artistic Director Ramon Tebar with his marked up ""Carmen"" score. (Photo: Harriet Howard Heithaus)

If you have, or you get, tickets to Bizet's best known opera, ""Carmen,"" at Artis—Naples on Wednesday and Thursday, you'll be watching from inside a jail cell.

But you won't miss any of the action. They'll let you out in time to see the fateful denouement from a center seat at the bullring.

Opera Naples' production was in animated rehearsal last Friday for a version that will both dip into the original Prosper Mérimée novella that inspired it and take a scissors to repetitive dialogue.

The result, its cast and crew hope, will be a ""Carmen"" that's imposing, but not puffy, and with a perspective closer to what the novella depicts.

""Look at my score,"" marveled Ramón Tebar, Opera Naples artistic director, nodding toward a hefty sheaf of well-marked papers. At least 40 paper clips munched at page flaps and yellow Post-its issued tonal warnings. As iconic as it is, ""Carmen"" can be bewildering. ""There are nine different versions of this opera — nine!""

""I'm using the original, the one with the dialogue,"" he said. ""There was another one with orchestrations by (Ernest) Guiraud that changed the dialogue to music, but I like the dialogue. It flows better. The question, of course, is still which version of 'Carmen' you're going to do.""

Jeffrey Buchman, stage director for this production, wanted to bring in some of its roots. So the opera at Artis—Naples will open in Don Jose's jail cell, where he sits, still blood-spattered after his murder of the woman he loved.

Whether it's love or obsession if for psychologists to debate. Part of the appeal of ""Carmen"" may be the public's fascination with her headstrong maneuvers among romances and its understanding of Don Jose's anguish over her fickle heart.

Either way, the audience is invited into Don Jose's cell, where he sees events of the last year float around him like a dream turned nightmare.

""We're actually seeing the whole story as a flashback,"" explained Ian Silverman, associate stage director. ""He is sort of reliving the events that brought him to this point. So we see Carmen going in and out of the cell at times. The whole show is staged inside his cell and there are some aura-setting devices, he continued.

""And at the very beginning of the show, these three women, who are dancers and who covered black mantillas, come. They represent his Carmen, his mother and Michaëla (Don Jose's own discarded sweetheart). And they surround him with rosaries and are praying for him.

""And at the very end they return. So this really brings home the idea that this was all one moment in his mind. That is actually true to the original novel — the story is being told by Don Jose inside his cell.""

In between those visits, there will be a lot of costuming; there are 96 people, from cigarette factory workers to soldiers in Don Jose's company, to the gypsies themselves.

""And that is the number of roles. Some of them have costume changes,"" warned Rebecca Welles.

Welles, a veteran of Aspen Music Festival and Yale and Saltmarsh opera companies, is the costume coordinator entrusted with making everyone come colorfully to life. Friday she was approving details of its costumes on singers, trying out pieces from eight boxes of costumes, shipped from Dayton (Ohio) Opera and a rental company.

It was no to the white socks beneath the petticoat worn by Kellie Motter, who plays Carmen's gypsy friend Frasquita: ""You need something darker there.""

And the question to settle for Megan Moore, who was getting fitted as another gypsy friend, Mercedes, was whether during a dance, she was to hike only the skirt, showing her petticoat. Or should she raise both skirt and petticoat, for a show of leg.

What would work in 2019 Florida would be risque for 1830s Spain, Welles told her: Skirt only.

In addition to working with seamstress Linda Jarrell of North Fort Myers, to make the clothing the right length, Welles was checking colors: ""You have to make sure the colors work with their skin tones,"" she said.

As she worked, makeup and hair specialist Jenna Weiner guided her around the inventory of the company's costume shop for extra accessories. The biggest chore will be repacking those costumes and matching their list with actual pieces.

""There's a lot more math in this job than anyone realizes,"" said Welles.

All those technicalities will escape the audience when the ""Carmen"" opens Wednesday. They'll see the stars and hear the Naples Philharmonic, which, to Tebar, is getting one of the best scores in the genre to perform.

Tebar recalled the words of another famous composer, Gustav Mahler: ""'If you want to learn how to orchestrate, get the score to ""Carmen.""'

""There are so many colors in the way Bizet orchestrates this — so much to it.""

If you go

Something else: Artistic director Ramón Tebar says all of the arias in ""Carmen are famous, but audiences should ""listen for the duets — the one between Don Jose and Michaela is one of the most touching music. Or the one between Escamillo (the toreador who replaces Don Jose) and Carmen.

""People don't expect Escamillo to sing. They think of him as the bad guy. But he's just fallen in love with Carmen, too.""

1333,Witnesses speak about crash that killed mother of 3 on MLK Parkway,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A witness is shedding new light on Wednesday's two-car crash on the MLK Parkway off-ramp at Phoenix Avenue that left a woman dead.

Although the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has not released the identity of the victim, her family identified her as Kinshasa Simon, 40, who was the mother of three.

A witness said Simon's car was T-boned by a fast-moving truck exiting off the ramp.

Hours after the crash, more firefighters arrived at the scene to help crews remove her body from the mangled car.

Traffic Homicide investigators said Simon was driving north on Phoenix Avenue when a pickup truck crashed into her car.

A witness, who asked not to be identified, said he was driving south of Phoenix Avenue toward Simon's car when he noticed a truck speeding off the ramp.

""The truck came through the intersection and hit the car. Six or seven people got out and checked on the lady,” the witness said.

But it was too late. Police said Simon was already dead.

Her brother, Rickie Simon Jr., said she left behind three children, ages 7, 13 and 16. He said all three are taking their mother's death very hard.

“We’ve taught them the importance of the word of God and that’s the only thing that’s getting them through,” the brother said.

His sister was a beloved hairdresser who was planning to go back to school to earn a degree in journalism.

“Journalism was her absolute love. She did hair because it was a great job and she earned income, but journalism was her life,” he said.

According to her brother, Simon's life affected many people.

“She touched so many lives. She was a sweetheart. She was a very sweet person,” he said.

The other driver in the crash has not been identified and investigators have not yet determined who was at fault.

1337,Car slams into Dollar Tree on Lem Turner Road,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A car struck a Northside Jacksonville Dollar Tree on Friday night, and amazingly, the car still drove after it was brought out of the building.

The store on Lem Turner Road was full of customers at the time of the crash, according to the manager. No one inside the store was hurt.

The driver of the car, which was a Toyota Camry, did not require medical attention at the scene. She asked not to be identified.

The only part of the store that appeared to be damaged was the glass doors.

Japanese reliability could be to thank for the Camry still running after the wreck, as the woman was seen driving away after speaking to police. It's unclear what caused the crash.

1341,"America's first female astronaut candidate, Jerrie Cobb, dies","In this 1960 photo made available by NASA, Jerrie Cobb prepares to operate the Multi-Axis Space Test Inertia Facility (MASTIF) at the Lewis Research Center in Ohio.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - America’s first female astronaut candidate, pilot Jerrie Cobb, who pushed for equality in space but never reached its heights, has died.

Cobb died in Florida at age 88 on March 18 following a brief illness. News of her death came Thursday from journalist Miles O’Brien, serving as a family spokesman.

In 1961, Cobb became the first woman to pass astronaut testing. Altogether, 13 women passed the arduous physical testing and became known as the Mercury 13. But NASA already had its Mercury 7 astronauts, all jet test pilots and all military men.

None of the Mercury 13 ever reached space, despite Cobb’s testimony in 1962 before a Congressional panel.

“We seek, only, a place in our nation’s space future without discrimination,” she told a special House subcommittee on the selection of astronauts.

Instead of making her an astronaut, NASA tapped her as a consultant to talk up the space program. She was dismissed one week after commenting: “I’m the most unconsulted consultant in any government agency.”

She wrote in her 1997 autobiography “Jerrie Cobb, Solo Pilot,” ″My country, my culture, was not ready to allow a woman to fly in space.”

Cobb served for decades as a humanitarian aid pilot in the Amazon jungle.

“She should have gone to space, but turned her life into one of service with grace,” tweeted Ellen Stofan, director of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum and a former NASA scientist.

The Soviet Union ended up putting the first woman into space in 1963: Valentina Tereshkova. NASA didn’t fly a woman in space — Sally Ride — until 1983.

Cobb and other surviving members of the Mercury 13 attended the 1995 shuttle launch of Eileen Collins, NASA’s first female space pilot and later its first female space commander.

“Jerrie Cobb served as an inspiration to many of our members in her record breaking, her desire to go into space, and just to prove that women could do what men could do,” said Laura Ohrenberg, headquarters manager in Oklahoma City for the Ninety-Nines Inc., an international organization of licensed women pilots.

Still hopeful, Cobb emerged in 1998 to make another pitch for space as NASA prepared to launch Mercury astronaut John Glenn — the first American to orbit the world — on shuttle Discovery at age 77.

Cobb maintained that the geriatric space study should also include an older woman.

“I would give my life to fly in space, I really would,” Cobb told The Associated Press at age 67 in 1998. “It’s hard for me to talk about it, but I would. I would then, and I will now.”

“It just didn’t work out then, and I just hope and pray it will now,” she added.

It didn’t. NASA never flew another elderly person in space, male or female.

Geraldyn Cobb was born on March 5, 1931, in Norman, Oklahoma, the second daughter of a military pilot and his wife. She flew her father’s open cockpit Waco biplane at age 12 and got her private pilot’s license four years later.

The Mercury 13′s story is told in a recent Netflix documentary and a play based on Cobb’s life, “They Promised Her the Moon,” is currently running in San Diego.

In her autobiography, Cobb described how she danced on the wings of her plane in the Amazon moonlight, when learning via radio on July 20, 1969, that Apollo 11′s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had landed on the moon.

She wrote: “Yes, I wish I were on the moon with my fellow pilots, exploring another celestial body. How I would love to see our beautiful blue planet Earth floating in the blackness of space. And see the stars and galaxies in their true brilliance, without the filter of our atmosphere. But I’m happy flying here in Amazonas, serving my brethren. ‘Contenta, Senor, contenta.’ (I am happy, Lord, happy.)”

1343,Doorbell camera captures woman crying for help on stranger's front porch,"HOUSTON (KTRK/CNN) - A Texas family found terrifying images on their Ring doorbell camera.

Angelica Rodriguez and her husband saw a half-dressed woman crying for help in the middle of the night.

By the time anyone opened the door, she was gone.

Now the family is now left wondering what it was all about.

The video showed the distraught woman only wearing a t-shirt, visibly shaken and desperately asking for help.

“I did not think about opening the door, it really scared me,"" said Angelica Rodriguez. ""It can be a trap or something.""

She said she didn’t think of opening the door because she was afraid.

When she told her husband to get the phone and call police, the woman was gone.

“Honestly I’m glad they didn’t open the door,” said Brenda Rodriguez, Angelica Rodriguez’s daughter-in-law. “Their safety comes first so we don’t know what her intentions were.”

Brenda Rodriguez posted the video on a neighborhood social media page.

Some people claimed they may have possibly seen the woman before.

“We are going to turn the video over to police to see if maybe they can open an investigation,” Brenda Rodriguez said.

For now it’s unclear if this woman was truly in danger.",http://www.wfla.com/national/doorbell-camera-captures-half-dressed-woman-crying-for-help-on-strangers-front-porch/1937001038,2019-04-18T21:26:56Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606

Michelle Redfern's first instinct when she saw a 2-foot-long coral snake slithering in her garage Wednesday morning was to grab a machete or start the rhyme. ""Red touches Black, Friend of Jack; Red touches Yellow, Kill a Fellow ...""

""Black on yellow, deadly fellow ... Oh God, it's an actual coral snake!,"" she thought.

Her husband was barefoot and wearing boxers in the garage at her home in Magnolia Park in Melbourne.

""I grabbed my boots and machete and assessed the situation, and then I used the machete to scoop it into the pitcher,"" she said.

Redfern, owner of the popular Kona Ice shaved ice food truck, says the only time she's seen a coral snake was at a zoo.

""I spent some time in Texas, and rattlesnakes are big and scary, but I know that coral snakes don't strike,"" she said.

She actually had a turn of heart and ended up rescuing and relocating the venomous snake.

Her husband, William Navarro II, helped out, too. ""He was my driver and cameraman,"" she joked.

""We actually saved it from a neighborhood cat the second time around,"" she said. ""At which point, we felt, for the sake of both animals, we'd handle the situation. We didn't want to kill the coral snake because, being a native Florida resident, this was the first time having the opportunity to come up close and personal with such a beautiful creature.""

This particular coral snake, known as the eastern coral snake, is among the six most dangerous snakes in Florida, which has 44 species. While its bite is serious and should receive immediate medical attention, fatalities are rare. Coral snakes generally do not bite and if they do, it is often a dry bite or they inject a very low volume of venom.

It's quite rare to see one in a housing area.

""We believe that with a lot of debris being cleared from the Hibiscus Road recently, this snake may have been forced out of its natural habitat. Live and let live.""

1354,'Like a third world country': Business leaders get firsthand look at slow Michael recovery,"Resilient.

The word echoed during last week’s Hurricane Michael Recovery Mission, which brought together members of the Florida Chamber Foundation, statewide business leaders and Rebuild 850 representatives to see for themselves the devastation wrought in the Panhandle by the Category 5 hurricane.

“To be fair, no other community is as resilient as this one,” the Chamber Foundation’s Executive Vice President Tony Carvajal said.

The two-day tour included briefings from local leaders, such as Gulf Coast State College President Dr. John Holdnak, Executive Director of Habitat for Humanity of Bay County Lance Rettig, and President of the Bay County Chamber of Commerce Carol Roberts. Attendees also met with small local business owners to hear their needs and perspectives on the progress of recovery.

On the first day, 27 participants loaded on a bus in Panama City and headed to Mexico Beach where they saw homes in shambles, blue tarps on roof after roof, and empty lots where homes once stood.

For several of them, it was their first time seeing the magnitude of the damage where Hurricane Michael stormed onto land. Driving along the shoreline, people snapped photos through the bus windows and shook their heads at the sights of destruction.

Cissy Proctor, managing partner at the Tallahassee office of LSN Partners, teared up as she took in the reality of what people in the Mexico Beach community are still dealing with every day. The executive director of the state Department of Economic Opportunity under former Gov. Rick Scott visited the area a week after the hurricane and hadn’t been back since.

“There has been some clean up but there’s still so much more to do,” she said. “It’s just hard to see.”

The next stop for the group was Caribbean Coffee on U.S. 98. Michael Myhre, CEO of the Florida Small Business Development Center Network Headquarters, introduced the owner of the local coffee shop, David Kiser.

Just days after Michael struck, Myhre went to Kiser’s shop to see how we was doing. Although there was no power or running water, he offered to make Myhre a cup of coffee. Kiser’s hospitality showed the character of the people in the community, Mhyre said - resilient.

After purchasing coffee, smoothies, and baked goods, the group climbed back onto the bus to head to the Tyndall Airforce Base. The ravaging of the base was apparent from the main road. Roofs were ripped away from structures. Buildings were in pieces.

During the bus tour of the facilities Col. Brian Laidlaw pointed out the major areas of destruction. Many of the airplane hangars were in shambles, missing roofs and walls. The vast majority of homes on the base have to be gutted and remodeled.

Following the tour of the Airforce base, the group met with the ToolBank Disaster Services CEO Patty Russart. ToolBank provides a variety of tools and assistance during natural disasters to help increase volunteer impact and decrease costs for organizations. The facility provided wheelbarrows, rakes, shovels, ladders and a myriad of other tools to assist in disaster relief after the hurricane.

At the final stop of the day, the participants gathered for dinner and heard from Jamal Sowell, president and CEO of Enterprise Florida, former Speaker of the Florida House Allen Bense and CFO Jimmy Patronis.

“The working man and working woman are struggling. They are really struggling” said Bense. “It’ll take 2 or 3 years, but we’ll come back.”

The second of the hurricane damage tour began with a briefing from Proctor at Gulf Coast State College.

“This is not a sympathy tour, it’s an impact tour,” she said addressing the room full of business leaders and area officials.

Proctor shared a slideshow of images from just days after the storm and noted that there had been progress but that there is still a long road ahead.

Later that day, the group met with Calhoun County officials at the Calhoun County Public Library in Blountstown, where the devastation of the storm is still acute.

“One of the things that is the scariest, is how resilient we are,” said Kristy Terry, executive director of the Calhoun County Chamber of Commerce. “What we say is ‘we are okay’ …. we have held our head high the whole time when we should’ve been screaming our heads off.”

During lunch at Baggett Farms in Marianna, Kevin Yoder, chairman of North Florida Long Term Recovery, addressed the room.

“We are used to fending for ourselves and fixing it ourselves,” he said, as Tyler Lipford, chairman of Jackson County Chamber of Commerce chimed in, “It’s what we’ve done our whole life, but we need help and that’s hard for us to ask for.”

At one of the final stops of the tour in Jackson County, Southern Craft Creamery owner Cindy Eade minced no words.

“There are still lots of people who don’t have homes, there are lots of people in the agriculture field who don’t have the money to repair anything,” she told the visitors. “They have loans to pay for that are hard to pay when you are trying to repair stuff.”

Todd Powell, who serves on the board of directors for the Florida Chamber of Commerce and is vice president of real estate development with Weyerhaeuser, left the trip full of new information and a fresh perspective on the steps needed to move forward.

“While it is shocking to sit there and see the damage to the buildings and infrastructure, the real damage being done is to the individuals and that will last for generations to come,” Powell said.

“It’s a three-prong approach. It’s all about the dollars and continuing to get donations. Educating Tallahassee is a very important part because part of our state looks, quite frankly, like a third world country, especially when you consider we are six months post storm.

We need to put this on a national perspective because there are thousands and thousands of Floridians who need help from the government.”

Tour takeaways

Michelle Ubben, president of Sachs Media Group, went on the two-day Hurricane Michael Recovery Mission tour and collected these quotes:

Gulf Coast State College President Dr. John Holdnak

Turned an educational building on campus into Bay County’s hub for emergency operations and invited local radio station 90.7 to embed. That became the only way locals got information in the days right after the storm. Believes state colleges across Florida can learn from their experience create similar partnerships in advance of the next disaster.

“Words fail to convey the scope of the disaster. We learned that things don’t matter, but people matter more than we ever imagined. We couldn’t change the cards we were dealt, so we changed how we played the cards.”

Suzan Gage, Executive Director of the Northwest Florida Early Learning Coalition

52% of child care providers in seven counties are operating on a provisional license because of structural damage and other issues. Providers are struggling to get facilities back to where they need to be at the same time they’re trying to meet the need today. Some families are spending as much as 30% of their take-home pay on child care.

“Picture parents who are worried about their children being in a safe environment while they leave them to go to work, classrooms of preschoolers who are suffering the emotional effects of post-storm trauma, pre-school teachers whose homes were destroyed but they’re still showing up for work every day because they know someone has to watch the kids. That’s what we’re coping with.”

Mike Myhre, Florida Small Business Development Center Network

Has helped to connect damaged small businesses with loans that provide up to $50,000 at no interest for a year. Assistance from the SBDC helped businesses like Vicki Fuqua’s Great Oak Pet Resort in Marianna, David Kiser’s Caribbean Coffee in Mexico Beach, and Cindy and Dale Eade’s Southern Craft Creamery in Marianna back in business.

“Florida’s 2.5 million small businesses account for half of the state’s GDP. History tells us if a small business doesn’t reopen within a week of a disaster, they probably never will. If you want to get people off the unemployment line, help small businesses reopen.”

Col. Brian Laidlaw, Commander Tyndall Air Force Base

Explained the strategic geographic importance of Tyndall, with its 129 miles of unobstructed coastline. In the 22 hours before the storm, Tyndall secured the airfield and evacuated 11,000 people and all planes. The base, which was ground zero for Hurricane Michael, was leveled by 155 mph winds. Half of the base’s 484 buildings can be repaired, while the other half will have to be replaced. Of 867 homes on base, none are livable. Some airmen are still living in tents repurposed from Iraq and Afghanistan.

“The Air Force is not going to walk away from a base in Florida with such strategic national importance because of hurricanes, any more than it would walk away from a base in California because they have earthquakes and wildfires.”

Clay Ingram, CEO Volunteer Florida

Described the overwhelming volunteer response after the storm, which to date has included 65,000 volunteers contributing 700,000 hours of service. Immediately after the hurricane, volunteers were needed to locate the missing, muck out houses and tarp roofs. Now, the biggest role for volunteers is in rebuilding homes.

“In the wake of tragedy, you see the good in humanity. There will be a need here for a long time. But there’s a bright future for this region if people are willing to help.”

CFO Jimmy Patronis

“You don’t really understand how bad it is because people don’t complain here.”

Michael Kilts, Director of Federal Programs, Jackson County School District

Shared that Jackson County schools suffered $23 million in damage, has 62 roofs that need to be replaced, lost all sports facilities, gymnasiums, classrooms and buses and many teachers, who were rendered homeless and moved away. Before the storm, 63 students were in transitional housing. Now, 2,869 are in transitional housing, representing 44% of the student population.

“Before the storm, we were one natural disaster away from chaos. Welcome to chaos.”

Thomas Flowers, CEO of the Calhoun Liberty Credit Union

Explained that Calhoun County depends on seven fire departments that lost every bit of fire equipment they had. Each one needs $10,000 to replace fire fighting equipment in order to have a chance to protect homes from the wildfires that likely are coming.

“We really don’t know what to do. We’re open to any suggestions from anyone.”

Johanna Plummer, chairman of the Calhoun County Chamber of Commerce

Told the story of Calhoun Liberty Hospital, which sustained serious damage from Hurricane Michael, losing 80% of its roof and leaving it with space for only 10 beds. The hospital is the lifeblood of the community, seeing more than 50 patients on any given day. It also holds the key to other critical community assets, including a network of nursing homes, assisted living facilities and a prison -- one of the county’s biggest employers. By state law, those facilities cannot operate unless they are within a prescribed number of miles from a hospital.

“Without funding soon to rebuild the hospital, the entire community dies.”

Richard Pinsky, lobbyist, Akerman

Explained that Jackson County has more row crop farmers than any other county in the state, producing much of the state’s peanut and cotton crops. In 2017, Jackson County cotton farmers produced 55,000 bales of cotton. Hurricane Michael reduced that yield to 2,000 bales in 2018.

“These farmers need a short-term loan program so they can get a crop in the ground in the next 30 days. They aren’t looking for a handout. They will pay it back. But if they don’t get help immediately, these folks will not recover.”

Anthony Hendry was taken into custody at 3495 W. Anthony Road for luring and enticing a child, attempt, on Wednesday. He was taken to the Marion County Jail. As of Saturday, Hendry was still at the jail on $1,000. His next court hearing is May 13th at 1 p.m.

On April 12, officers were called to a restaurant on North Pine Avenue for a suspicious call. When officers arrived, a woman told them she and her family went to the eatery to have dinner. She said a 7-year-old girl who was with her went to use the restroom by herself. When the child returned, the child said a man had opened the men’s restroom door and made a gesture for her to enter.

The woman went to the men’s restroom and was unable to open the door. The incident was reported to staff members who were unable to open the door. They yelled for the person to open the door and a man, later identified as Hendry, opened it. Hendry denied doing anything wrong and told employees he owned the business. He was told to leave and given a trespass warning.

Officers said Hendry made sexual comments to them and due to his behavior he was detained under Florida's Baker Act. In the meantime, officers continued with their investigation.

1359,These harmless Florida snakes look a lot like their venomous cousins. Can you tell the difference?,"CLOSE The Sunshine State is home to 44 different types of snakes, but only six are considered dangerous. These have venomous bites that can harm humans, and should be avoided. Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

Out of the 50 species of snakes native to Florida, only 6 are venomous. But some harmless snakes avoid predators by impersonating their dangerous counterparts.

Can you tell the difference between a dangerous coral snake and a mild-mannered king snake? Is that angry-looking ""viper"" in the flower bed really as vicious as it seems?

Here's how to spot the differences between venomous snakes and harmless fakers.

Scarlet king snake vs. coral snake

The coral snake is one of Florida's venomous species. In fact, it has the second-most deadly venom of any snake in North America. Very few bites are reported, however, because they tend to be shy and are slow to bite.

The scarlet king snake sports the same distinctive banding pattern as the coral snake, and in the same colors. King snakes are often killed because they're mistaken for coral snakes.

The difference, and it's a minor one, is in the order of the, black, red and yellow bands on the snake.

If you grew up anywhere in the coral snake's large southeastern range, you probably heard the rhyme, ""If red touches yellow, it's bad for a fellow. If red touches black, friend of Jack,"" or something similar. It's an easy way to remember that the narrow bands are yellow on a coral snake and black on a king snake.

But, as is the rule for all snakes, stay away if you're not sure.

Banded water snake vs. cottonmouth

The trouble with brown snakes is they all look very similar. The cottonmouth is a common and venomous Florida snake, also called a water moccasin. It's a semi-aquatic viper that you might find around any body of fresh water in the southeastern United States. It's named for the pale coloring inside its mouth. Most importantly, the cottonmouth packs a mean and potentially deadly bite.

Banded water snakes have a similar patchy brown appearance, and they can flatten their heads to look like vipers when they're threatened. But they are, in fact, non-venomous lookalikes that have mastered the art of disguise.

The visual difference between the two is the shape of the head and body. A cottonmouth has a heavy body and a blocky, wedge-shaped head. A water snake has a slender body and small head, with no distinct neck. When threatened a water snake can flatten its head and body to create a shape similar to a cottonmouth, but the head will look flat, not blocky.

The cottonmouth also has a narrow, vertical pupil, while banded water snakes have round pupils.

Hognose vs. copperhead

Copperheads are not as common in Florida as other parts of the southeast, but their range does include parts of north Florida and the panhandle. Rarely, copperheads are spotted further south in the peninsula. They are pit vipers with very effective brown and tan camouflage. Copperhead bites are painful, but very rarely fatal.

Hognose snakes come in a variety of colors and patterns. They can be recognized by their pointy, upturned noses. Sometimes called ""puff adders"" in Florida, these snakes are harmless. When threatened, they mimic vipers by raising and ""puffing up"" their heads with air while they coil their bodies. Some hognose snakes can also flatten their heads to take on a cobra-like appearance. They will hiss and strike with their pointy noses, but they don't attempt to bite. If the viper charade doesn't work, they'll roll over and play dead.

If you come across a patchy, brown snake that coils its body and raises its head like a viper, use your ears. Copperheads don't make a sound. They'll freeze when threatened and only strike as a last resort. Hognose snakes, on the other hand, make hissing sounds when they're impersonating vipers.

Hognose snakes can't exactly mimic the signature triangular head shape of a viper. Their heads look rounder and puffy. They also have black eyes, whereas copperheads have yellow eyes.

Eastern indigo snake vs. rattlesnake

Florida is home to three different species of rattlesnake: the pigmy rattlesnake, the eastern diamondback and the timber rattlesnake. All three are venomous. While bites are rarely deadly, rattlesnake venom causes painful swelling and an untreated bite can result in serious complications.

Rattlesnakes are easily identifiable by their warning rattle and viper characteristics. Like all snakes, they'd rather not tangle with a human, but rattlers are quick to strike when threatened.

The eastern indigo snake is not venomous and doesn't have fangs or a rattle, but that doesn't stop it from acting like a rattlesnake. When threatened, they'll flatten their heads, hiss and vibrate their tails like rattlesnakes.

In reality, the indigo snake is a gentle giant. Adults can be up to seven feet in length, with glossy black or dark blue scales. They're known to be docile and are very reluctant to bite. Indigo snakes are one of several species commonly referred to as a ""black snake"" in the southeast.

The visual differences between a real rattlesnake and an indigo snake are obvious. Besides their signature rattle, rattlesnakes have mottled brown or gray and black coloring and triangular heads. Pigmy rattlers can have orange or red spots along their backs. The largest rattlesnake in Florida, the eastern diamondback, is rarely more than five feet long.

1361,Severe weather prompts flight cancellations in South Florida,"There is a severe weather warning in effect for Palm Beach and Collier counties Friday night. File photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images

PEMBROKE PARK, Fla. - A strong storm system barreling through Florida on Friday left a girl dead just south of Tallahassee and prompted flight cancellations at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Miami International Airport, as it prompted tornado warnings in Georgia, the Carolinas and southern Virginia.

A severe thunderstorm watch was activated in Palm Beach and Collier counties until 10 p.m. This includes the cities of West Palm Beach, Naples, Clewiston and Labelle. An isolated storm or two could produce damaging wind gusts.

There is also a high risk of rip currents, powerful channels of water flowing quickly away from shore in Broward and Miami-Dade counties. The line of strong storms will blow through South Florida until 11 p.m., and the heavy rain will move out after midnight. Saturday morning will be mostly dry.

The 8-year-old girl who died Friday was identified as Mariah Juliette Weinman, a student at Woodville Elementary School. Her 12-year-old brother was injured when a tree fell onto their house in Leon County's town of Woodville.

""We are deeply saddened by the loss of a Woodville School second grader this morning,"" the Leon County Schools tweeted. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this time.""

1362,Storms in South kill girl in Florida,"A tree fell onto a house in Woodville, Florida, south of Tallahassee, killing the girl and injuring a 12-year-old boy.

ATLANTA — A strong storm system barreling through the South on Friday killed an 8-year-old girl in Florida and threatened to bring tornadoes to large parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia.

A tree fell onto a house in Woodville, Florida, south of Tallahassee, killing the girl and injuring a 12-year-old boy, according to the Leon County Sheriff's Office. The office said in a statement that the girl died at a hospital while the boy suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Their names weren't immediately released.

The same storm system was blamed for the deaths a day earlier of three people in Mississippi and a woman in Alabama.

The threat on Friday shifted farther east, where tornado warnings covered parts of northeast Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia.

The national Storm Prediction Center said 9.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were at a moderate risk of severe weather. The region includes the Charlotte, North Carolina metro area.

Torrential downpours, large hail and a few tornadoes were among the hazards, the National Weather Service in Raleigh, North Carolina, warned.

Radar readings appeared to show a tornado formed in western Virginia's Franklin County, south of Roanoke, though damage on the ground still must be assessed, said National Weather Service Meteorologist Phil Hysell. In South Carolina, authorities urged motorists to avoid part of Interstate 26 — the main artery from Upstate through Columbia and all the way to Charleston — because downed trees had left the roadway scattered with debris.

In Georgia, the storm system knocked down trees, caused flooding and cut off power to tens of thousands of people.

A tree came down on an apartment complex in an Atlanta suburb, but only one person reported a minor injury and was treated at the scene, Gwinnett County fire spokesman Capt. Tommy Rutledge told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

In Forsyth County northeast of Atlanta, three firefighters suffered minor injuries when their firetruck overturned during heavy rain and wind, Fire Department Division Chief Jason Shivers told the newspaper.

Meanwhile, hundreds of people cleaned up part of a central Mississippi town hit hard by a tornado on Thursday.

Volunteers and family members were swarming the north side of Morton, where the National Weather Service says a twister with winds as high as 132 mph (212 kph) hit a neighborhood. More than 20 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. The town of 3,500 is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Jackson.

""When it stopped, there was nothing left,"" Morton resident Sharon Currie told WAPT-TV. ""I was going, 'Oh my God. My house is gone.'""

Forecasters confirmed that 14 tornadoes had touched down in Mississippi and damage from the storm system was reported in at least 24 of the state's 82 counties. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency — the second one he has declared in less than a week due to tornadoes.

Authorities on Friday reported a third storm-related death in the state. Freddie Mobley, 63, died while helping cut a tree that had fallen on a house, Lincoln County Coroner Clay McMorris told the Daily Leader of Brookhaven. Mobley had made a few cuts on the tree and backed away when the trunk shifted before he could move, Deputy Coroner Ricky Alford said.

1363,Screen Time: The Curse of La Llorona,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

The legend of “La Llorona”, spanish for the weeping woman, has been a part of Hispanic culture for decades. And now the Mexican folktale made its way to the big screen.

""I am very familiar with 'La Llorona' I am Venezuelan but I grew up in Mexico and ever since I was around five, that was the first time I heard about her. She doesn't stay in Mexico, she comes with you and she's not someone that you stop believing once you grow up. There have been sightings of La Llorona, people hear her, they see her and they feel her, so she's very real to us,"" said Patricia Velazquez who plays ""Patricia Alvarez"" in the film.

""La Llorona"" is the ghost of a woman who drowned her children and now cries while looking for them in the river, often causing misfortune to those who are near or hear her.

In the movie a social worker with two children in 1970's Los Angeles, is called in to check in on one of her cases where there’s suspected foul play. As she digs deeper, she finds striking similarities between the case and the terrifying supernatural occurrences haunting her family.

1365,"From the yard to a container: Rattlesnake, caught by Cocoa trapper, moved to serpentarium for antivenin","CLOSE Steven Henson, who works for Florida Wildlife Trappers of Cocoa, strapped a video camera on his snake tongs to film the apprehension of a rattlesnake Rick Neale, FLORIDA TODAY

Coiled quietly beneath saw palmetto bushes, the eastern diamondback rattlesnake awaited prey near a bird feeder in Lori Parsons' backyard — until one of her startled dogs startled barking at it.

Soon after, confronted by a trapper, the snake shook its rattle as a noisy warning — to no avail. It was seized by tongs, lifted into the air, placed inside a nylon bag, and transported to Reptile World Serpentarium.

Now, the 5-foot rattler occupies a gray rectangular plastic container on the St. Cloud serpentarium's ""venom line.""

Living on a diet of dead rats, the fanged reptile's venom will be harvested, freeze-dried and shipped to New Zealand, where it will create antivenin used to treat snakebite victims in hospital emergency rooms.

""It was just such a magnificent beast. We certainly didn't want to kill it. I know a lot of people chop their heads off,"" Parsons said.

""We weren't trying to kill this animal that was just trying to survive,"" she said.

Rattlesnake in the yard

Parsons lives in Wedgefield, a small rural community south of Bithlo in eastern Orange County. She feared for the safety of her dogs, Layla and Chelsea, after the rattler's initial appearance.

""It came onto our porch about a month ago, and it was slithering along our screen room and the dogs found it. My husband went out to see what they were barking at and saw the snake,"" Parsons recalled.

""He called me and said, 'We've got this snake in the yard.' And I could hear the rattle through his cell phone and my cell phone — that's how loud the rattle was. It was frightening,"" she said.

Friday, Parsons' son spotted the serpent coiled beneath a clump of palmettos in her backyard. Layla was outside, barking at the concealed snake.

Parsons called Florida Wildlife Trappers of Cocoa. Melbourne resident Steven Henson, a veteran trapper, drove to the scene and captured the pit viper. He described the snake as aggressive and energetic.

In June 2014, Henson made news by netting Sushi, a juvenile bull shark that mysteriously appeared in the large freshwater pond at Gleason Park in Indian Harbour Beach.

Hundreds of spectators and a television news helicopter watched the action — and now every June, the city organizes a Shark in the Park 5K race.

Threatened by humans

The eastern diamondback rattlesnake is one of six venomous snake species found throughout the Sunshine State, including barrier islands and the Keys.

Rattlesnakes prefer areas with palmetto scrub, and they can slither into gopher tortoise burrows during winter, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reports.

However, a severe decline in rattlesnake population can be attributed to agricultural development, urban sprawl and commercial hunting, the Florida Museum of Natural History reports.

Reptile World Serpentarium opened in 1972 in St. Cloud. Touted by a large cobra sign facing U.S. 192, the facility houses more than 80 snake species along with alligators, dozens of turtles, iguanas and fellow cold-blooded critters.

George Van Horn founded and owns the Old Florida-style roadside attraction. His serpentarium hosts daily ""venom shows"" at noon and 3 p.m., where spectators watch him ""milk"" deadly snakes by extracting their venom into collecting glasses.

For future bite victims: Serpentarium milks rattlesnakes for venom

""If you live down here, this will not be news to you: There is no conservation going on in the state of Florida,"" Van Horn said while describing eastern diamondback rattlesnakes during the 3 p.m. Wednesday venom show.

""I always had a feeling if I would go up and break into the governor's office, and sneak in there and look under his desk, I'd see a little binder that said, 'Bulldoze it. Build it. Sell it. And move on,' "" Van Horn said.

""I grew up in Florida, and I'm watching it go down the tubes. Every time I turn around, they go out and bulldoze another 2,000, 3,000 acres of land down to sugar sand,"" he said.

Venom used to save lives

Every year, 7,000 to 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only five fatalities are recorded in a typical year.

Reptile World Serpentarium has provided venom to researchers and universities around the world. Van Horn said the venom line houses roughly 540 deadly snakes, including 125 rattlesnakes. They are milked every 20 days or so — the rattler captured in Parsons' yard made its venom show debut Saturday.

The serpentarium collects and sells about 1 kilogram of freeze-dried rattlesnake venom every year, Van Horn said. Venom is shipped to New Zealand, where technicians inject small doses into sheep. In turn, the sheep produce antibodies that neutralize snake toxins.

CLOSE Reptile World Serpentarium owner George Van Horn and David Bledsoe, exhibit curator, milk two rattlesnakes during an April 17 ""venom show."" Rick Neale, FLORIDA TODAY

Sheep blood is shipped to Wales, where these antibodies are purified, processed and shipped as antivenin to U.S. hospital pharmacies, Van Horn told the venom show crowd.

""It turns out snake venom proteins have been extremely valuable research tools in just about every aspect of physiology study,"" Van Horn said.

""We use venom components to learn about blood chemistry, cell structure, disease mechanisms, genetics, neurobiology,"" he said.

Van Horn told spectators colorful snake stories: the young man who was bitten twice by a coral snake he caught on a Melbourne Beach sand dune; the retired Orlando woman who was shocked by a $962,000 hospital bill after a pygmy rattlesnake bit her foot in her yard.

Asked about pythons in the Everglades, Van Horn said the fearsome reptiles are here to stay — ""they can nuke the Everglades, but the pythons would probably be the only ones left,"" he quipped.

""I understand people get excited about snakes. But the worst invasive species to hit Florida, you see him in the mirror every morning.""

1368,"Coral snake spared the machete; Melbourne woman has heart even after rhyme, saves cat, too","CLOSE Michelle Redfern's first instinct when she saw a 2-foot coral snake slithering in her garage Wednesday morning was to grab a machete or start the rhyme. ""Red touches black, friend of Jack; Red touches yellow, kill a fellow ..."" Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

Michelle Redfern's first instinct when she saw a 2-foot coral snake slithering in her garage Wednesday morning was to grab a machete or start the rhyme. ""Red touches Black, Friend of Jack; Red touches Yellow, Kill a Fellow ...""

""Black on yellow, deadly fellow ... Oh God, it's an actual coral snake!,"" she thought.

Her husband was barefoot and wearing boxers in the garage at her home in Magnolia Park in Melbourne.

""I grabbed my boots and machete and assessed the situation, and then I used the machete to scoop it into the pitcher,"" she said.

Redfern, owner of the popular Kona Ice of Central Brevard Co. Truck, says the only time she's seen a coral snake was at a zoo.

""I spent some time in Texas, and rattlesnakes are big and scary, but I know that coral snakes don't strike,"" she said.

She actually had a turn of heart and ended up rescuing and relocating the venomous snake.

Her husband, William Navarro II, helped out, too. ""he was my driver and cameraman,"" she joked.

""We actually saved it from a neighborhood cat the second time around,"" she said. ""At which point, we felt, for the sake of both animals, we'd handle the situation. We didn't want to kill the coral snake because, being a native Florida resident, this was the first time having the opportunity to come up close and personal with such a beautiful creature.""

This particular coral snake, known as the eastern coral snake, is among the six most dangerous snakes in Florida, which has 44 species. While its bite is serious and should receive immediate medical attention, fatalities are rare. Coral snakes generally do not bite and if they do, it is often a dry bite or they inject a very low volume of venom.

CLOSE The Sunshine State is home to 44 different types of snakes, but only six are considered dangerous. These have venomous bites that can harm humans, and should be avoided. Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

It's quite rare to see one in a housing area.

""We believe that with a lot of debris being cleared from the Hibiscus Road recently, this snake may have been forced out of its natural habitat. Live and let live.""

1369,Senior slugger: 65-year-old Florida woman hits burglar with bat,"""I took that bat and hit him upside the head, like 'pi-yah,' ""Gainey said, adding that the 5-foot-6, 300-pound man said, ""Ow!""

GAINESVILLE — When a Florida woman heard a noise and saw a man trying to break into her car early Sunday, she took matters into her own hands.

Clarese Gainey, 65, of Gainesville tells WGFL that she picked up her softball bat early Sunday, braced herself and eased open the door before hitting Antonio Mosley.

""I took that bat and hit him upside the head, like 'pi-yah,' ""Gainey said, adding that the 5-foot-6, 300-pound man said, ""Ow!""

Mosely ran to a nearby mobile home park, leaving behind his pants, shirt, and a sock, police said. A K-9 unit tracked him down, and Gainey said she easily identified him because of the knot on his head.

Gainey says she played softball in high school and can still swing a bat.

""He better be glad I didn't have a gun,"" Gainey said. ""Because I would have shot him.""

1371,"Woman robbed leaving her home in Allapattah, police say","MIAMI - Miami police are searching for a man who robbed a woman Monday outside her home in Miami's Allapattah's neighborhood.

Officer Kiara Delva, a spokeswoman for the Miami Police Department, said the man stole the woman's handbag from the front seat of her car around 1:30 p.m. as she closed the gate to her property in the 3100 block of Northwest 16th Street. The bag contained an iPhone 6S, credit cards and her driver's license, Delva said.

The woman tried to grab the bag and stop the man from fleeing but she was unsuccessful, Delva said. The robber was able to escape to a waiting dark-colored Nissan Altima. The incident was recorded by the homeowner's security camera.

Sometime later, the robber attempted to use the woman's credit card at a Footlocker store in the 8100 block of Northwest 27th Avenue.

Police described the robber as a black man in his 20s who is about 5 feet, 10 inches tall. He is cleanshaven and has a medium build.

1372,Florida woman accused of pointing gun at victim after she wouldn't turn right at red light,"The suspect was charged with two counts of aggravated assault.

BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. - A 51-year-old Cocoa woman is accused of pointing a gun at another woman after the victim would not turn right at a red light, according to an arrest report from the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office.

Penny Herndon was charged with two counts of aggravated assault.

On March 2, the victim was driving west on Highway 50 in Titusville and stopped at a red light.

The victim was going to merge onto Interstate 95, according to the arrest report.

The woman told investigators she saw a black van stop behind her.

The driver of the van started to honk the horn despite the light still being red, according to the report.

The arrest report shows the victim was unable to merge onto Interstate 95.

The light eventually turned green and both drivers moved onto the on-ramp of the interstate.

The driver of the black van followed closely behind the victim, according to the report.

Investigators said the victim told the sheriff’s office she changed lanes to allow the black van to pass her.

The black van passed her and changed lanes to get in front of her, according to the report.

The report shows the victim had to hit the brakes so she would not hit the van.

The victim said the driver of the van changed lanes to be parallel with her.

The sheriff’s office said the victim told investigators the suspect held a gun and pointed it at the victim’s car.

This caused the victim to hit her brakes and the van drove away.

The victim told investigators the gun looked like a semiautomatic type pistol with a silver or gray barrel and black handle grip.

The man sitting in the passenger seat confirmed her story to investigators.

The victim was able to give the sheriff’s office the license plate description.

The car was registered to Jerry True.

True told investigators his stepdaughter Penny Herndon was driving the van earlier.

Investigators later met with Herndon about the victim’s accusation.

Deputies said Herndon told investigators she was involved in a road rage incident, but she denied having a handgun or owning any guns.

She did tell investigators she owns a couple of pellet guns, according to the arrest report.

True told investigators his stepdaughter keeps a silver pellet gun in the van and uses it to chase raccoons away from her cats, according to the arrest report.

The victim was able to identify Herndon as the person who pointed the gun at her during a photo lineup.

1373,Florida man busted for singing dirty song to neighbor,"WILDWOOD, Fla. - Perhaps next time one Florida man will stick to the classics when attempting to impress a woman with a song.

Robert Mirabella, 62, was arrested Saturday after he played guitar and sang an original song to a woman he was serenading.

What got him in trouble was that Mirabella was sitting on the woman's porch and the song contained words not normally found in friendlier tunes.

According to the arrest report, Mirabella's lyrics contained phrases such as ""There is a neighbor who was a bitch and I see her now, she’s just a witch.”

The Smoking Gun reports the woman claimed to have ongoing issues with her neighbors in The Villages, just north of Orlando.

For his part, Mirabella claimed that he may have sang the song in front of the woman, but it didn't mean it was about her.

Mirabella was arrested for disorderly conduct and plead not guilty.

1378,Junior Achievement of Southwest Florida adds three to its Hall of Fame,"Three more entrepreneurs can now call themselves hall-of-famers in Southwest Florida.

The founder of a check printing business and longtime restaurateurs are the latest to join Junior Achievement of Southwest Florida's Business Hall of Fame.

For their business success and service as role models to youth and their peers, and their commitment to the community, Dave Copham and Scott and Diana Willis, are the latest to receive the special recognition.

The trio of winners were honored as laureates and inducted into the Hall of Fame during a ceremony Thursday night at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point in Bonita Springs.

Hundreds attended the ceremony, including students and business and community leaders.

The annual event raises money to support Junior Achievement's mission.

Junior Achievement reaches thousands of students with its programs in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties every year, providing them with mentorship opportunities and classes on such topics as financial literacy and career and work readiness.

Locally, the organization partnered with more than 200 classroom business volunteers during the 2017-2018 school, providing nearly 63,800 hours of instruction to more than 11,600 students in 519 classes.

The three laureates join dozens of others who have been named to the Hall of Fame in Southwest Florida since the recognition program began in 1988.

Laureates don't have to be involved in Junior Achievement, but they do have to be involved in the community.

Here's a look at this year's inductees:

Dave Copham

In 1985 Copham founded Liberty Check Printers. The company, headquartered in Mounds View, Minnesota, grew to become a leading supplier of personal checks for credit unions in the United States.

You're almost signed up for Breaking News Keep an eye out for an email to confirm your newsletter registration. More newsletters

Recognizing an industry-wide slowdown in the use of paper checks, Copham diversified the company, adding marketing services, education and e-commerce solutions, offered primarily to credit unions.

In June 2005 the company was acquired by one of its biggest rivals, the John H. Harland Co., for $160 million in an all-cash deal.

At the time of the acquisition, Copham and his family owned about 80 percent of the company, with the remainder owned by employees through an Employee Stock Option Plan, or ESOP.

Under Copham's direction, the business became the first S-corporation to offer stock to employees through an ESOP, which the law didn't allow before 1998.

With an S-Corporation shareholders don't pay self-employment taxes on their share of the company's profits. They're only taxed on the salary they pay themselves.

Originally from Minnesota, Copham began his career in 1967 as a pressman helper at Holden Business Forms, where he worked his way up the ladder to become a vice president of manufacturing.

Later Copham served as vice president of operations at Northstar Computer Forms for more than a decade. In that role he discovered the need for a check printing business, and he jumped on the opportunity.

Liberty Check grew by leaps and bounds — ultimately employing more than 1,000 workers across the country.

During Copham's 20 years of leadership, Liberty Check earned many awards and honors, including being named one of Minnesota’s top 100 employers in 1997 by Minnesota Business Magazine.

In 1996, Ernst & Young named Copham Entrepreneur of the Year in manufacturing for the Dakotas and Minnesota.

Copham met and married his wife Cheryl in 1965. They raised two children together, Kristen Mae and Jed. Today, the retired couple splits their time between Florida and Minnesota.

The Cophams support many charities here and elsewhere including SWFL Children’s Charities Inc., The Heights Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, Pace Center for Girls, Special Equestrian Inc., Naples Children & Education Foundation and the Mayo Foundation.

In his acceptance speech, Copham credited his success to his wife and his employees. Two former Liberty executives attended the ceremony.

Addressing the students in the audience, Copham said: ""While challenges seem almost insurmountable at times, in retrospect they pale by comparison to the very founding of our great Republic, our Bill of Rights and Constitution, the abolition of slavery, championing women's suffrage, surviving a Great Depression and two World Wars, civil rights won, surviving the resignation of a president and the events of 9/11. We have overcome and with future leaders like you young people, we will continue.""

He warned those future leaders about taking certain positions.

""It has been said only fools and fanatics are always so adamant about their opinions, whereas wise people are full of doubts, but use those doubts to create curiosity, curiosity to drive knowledge and knowledge to enhance the decision-making process.""

In closing he offered this piece of advice: ""Work hard, enjoy your life and be a constant learner. So, when you are old like me you can say like the Apostle Paul to his protégé Timothy, 'I have fought the good fight, I have run the race, I have kept the faith.'""

Scott and Diana Willis

Known for their people-driven approach to business and their generosity to charitable organizations, the Willises are owner-operators of Jason’s Deli of Southwest Florida. The couple has six successful stores in the region and they've earned several honors from the national chain, including Franchise of the Year in 2005 and 2013.

In 2014 the franchise received four Consumers' Choice Awards, including the top award for Availability of Healthy Options among fast-casual restaurants from research firm Technomic. Award winners are chosen based on customer traffic and feedback, as well as sales performance and market share.

The Willises operate stores from Sarasota to Naples, with more than 250 employees throughout the region.

The couple opened their first location in December 2001.

At 20 years old, Scott Willis began his career in the restaurant industry as a store manager for a McDonald’s franchisee. He quickly rose up the ranks to become a supervisor of 13 McDonald’s locations in Texas.

Scott and Diana Willis became business partners in their own McDonald’s franchise in Arkansas before selling it and launching Jason’s Deli of Southwest Florida.

Committed to improving the lives of others, the Willises serve as mentors within their company and the community through various philanthropic organizations. They support many nonprofits including the Abuse Counseling and Treatment Center, the American Heart Association, the Children’s Advocacy Center, Habitat for Humanity, and the Harry Chapin Food Bank.

Diana Willis sits on the Dean’s Council for Florida Gulf Coast University’s Lutgert College of Business. She previously served as the chairwoman of the advisory board for the university's School of Resort and Hospitality Management.

In 2015 she earned the Greater Fort Myers Chamber’s Women in Business committee's Apex Award, which recognizes outstanding women in the community who excel in the areas of professionalism, philanthropy and leadership.

Diana Willis was Gulfshore Life magazine’s 2015 Woman of the Year. In 2018 she received the Jon Davidson Humanitarian Award from Jason’s Deli for her efforts in partnering with the community for a better tomorrow.

Married for 32 years, Scott and Diana Willis have two sons, Brandon and Mason.

The couple met nearly 40 years ago in April 1980. In their acceptance speech, he said, ""It's been a compromise ever since.""

""Yes, we have come a long way,"" she added. ""Never in our wildest dreams did we think we would earn the title of laureate.""

The couple thanked the long list of people who helped them get where they are today including their sons, who Diana Willis said have ""given us the best opportunity to learn and hone our leadership skills in the very best way.""

When they moved to Southwest Florida to start their Jason’s Deli business in 2000, leaving McDonald's after more than 20 years, the Willises took a big risk, she said, but it's that risk that paved the opportunity for growth and a brighter future.

""Life is full of second chances, if you take them,"" he said.

The couple has always rooted for the underdog.

""Whether it was taking in a friend of Mason’s, a young man he played Lacrosse with, to live with us as a senior in high school, or making a commitment to a young woman who was going through a tough time and being there for her for more than 10 years, we never give up on others,"" Diana Willis said.

While neither of them graduated from college, she said they've never stopped learning and she encouraged the students listening in the audience to do the same.

She told the future leaders to set goals, to take ownership in all they do, to choose to shine, to accept failures as a growth opportunity, to hold themselves to the highest standard — and not to let others define their success.

Most importantly, she said is to ""do all things with great love,"" and to surround yourself with the people you love and the people who love you.

""Love is the greatest power,"" she said.

Tavares police said Channen Quashie, 29, of Eustis, was arrested Thursday night after an officer who was investigating a report of a stolen vehicle at the corner of Lake Avenue and Main Street heard what sounded like five gunshots coming from the area of Ingraham Park.

The officer went to where they thought the gun was fired and came across a white car with several bullet holes in the rear driver's side panel. The driver's side window was also shattered, according to a police report.

Police said the man who was sitting in the driver's seat when the shooting started told officers he saw Quashie pull up in a black SUV, roll down the front window and smile before firing the gun at the victim and his friends.

The victim said he exited the car and jumped on the ground to avoid getting hit, the report said.

A friend of the victim said he was standing outside the vehicle talking to the victim when Quashie pulled up and fired about three to four shots in his direction, police said. The friend said he was previously in the United States Army and felt as if he was ""still in Iraq"" when the shooting started, according to the report.

Police said they found a bullet casing in the middle of Ruby Street while processing the scene.

Lake County deputies and Eustis police officers, who had been given a description of the black SUV Quashie was believed to be in when the shooting happened, later found the vehicle in Eustis and took Quashie into custody on Glover Street, the report said.

Quashie was taken to the Lake County Jail and faces two felony counts of attempted murder and one count of discharging a firearm in public.

Surveillance video of the stabbed woman, Marylou Villalobos Palos, shows her running through the street yelling for help as the attacker, 25-year-old James Carlos Melendrez, chased her. Police said the incident began around 5 p.m. when Melendrez got into a fight outside a Salvation Army store and ran to a nearby apartment complex. He forced his way into a home by smashing a back window and encountered Palos and her teenage daughters. Family members say Melendrez grabbed a kitchen knife, and in an effort to draw him away from her children, Palos ran out of the house and down the street, prompting him to give chase. Melendrez eventually caught her and stabbed her 20 times in the face, neck and upper body. ""She’s going to be OK,"" Palos’ husband, Enrique, said. Her daughters say they know their mother was trying to protect them. “She did save our lives,” says Elizabeth Palos. ""That’s an awesome thing. My mom is the best. I love her so much. I’m grateful to have a mom like that.”During the stabbing, good Samaritans in a BMW stopped to help Palos. The suspect then chased them and stole their BMW.“He was on drugs,” said Kelly Meyer. “You could tell he was on something. His eyes were just weird, like they were looking through you. Just strange. He looked weird.”Authorities said Melendrez drove erratically, jumped a curb and struck a woman on the sidewalk. The crime spree was brought to an end when a passing bicyclist pepper sprayed Melendrez. Melendrez was jailed and held on a $2 million bail.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/family-video-shows-mom-leading-attacker-away-from-daughters-before-being-stabbed-20-times/27206457,2019-04-19T14:59:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA",FL,33410

1390,"Attempted murder suspect arrested months after shooting, police say","DeLAND, Fla. - A citizen tip led DeLand police to arrest a man wanted on an attempted murder charge months after a shooting, officials said.

Authorities said someone reported that Daymont Ward, 18, was at a residence on Franklin Avenue Wednesday morning. While conducting surveillance, an officer saw a woman walk out of a four-door Mercury and knock on a front window of the residence until Ward opened the door, according to the report.

Police said Ward asked the woman, ""Is it clear?"" before walking to the vehicle. A traffic stop was conducted on the Mercury, but by that point, Ward was no longer in the ca. The female passenger and male driver denied having ever seen him, the affidavit said.

Another tipster said Ward arrived at a home on foot about 10 minutes after that incident, then was picked up by a relative 40 minutes later, according to the report. That home was searched and Ward was not found, but his hat had been left behind.

The driver of the Mercury was interviewed again and said that Ward tried to get in his vehicle and he told him to get out, so Ward fled through a backyard, according to authorities.

Ward was arrested in a wooded lot that same day on charges of attempted first-degree murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Police said Ward and Stephen Bruten, 18, were involved in a Jan. 23 shooting in the Candlelight Oaks subdivision that left a man injured.

Ward is being held at the Volusia County Jail without bond. Bruten remains at large.

HUDSON, Fla. (WFLA) - A Hudson man is facing charges after deputies say he threatened a woman with a machete.

Kevin Taylor, 39, was arrested Thursday evening at his home in Hudson. Deputies say they were called to the home just after 6 p.m. and spoke with the victim who told them Taylor had started to act erratically with her and threaten her.

The victim told deputies Taylor started sharpening a machete while telling her he ""can't wait til he slices her throat, sees her bleed out and take her last breath,"" the arrest report says.

A responding deputy wrote in the arrest report that he witnessed Taylor walking around with a machete in his hand. The deputy also said Taylor was ""threatening me if I got any closer"" and refused several commands to drop the machete.

Taylor eventually retreated to a shed where he hid the machete before trying to run away, according to the arrest report. Deputies say they chased him down and were able to detain him.

Taylor was arrested for aggravated assault and resisting arrest without violence.

1392,"New York man accused of threatening to kill girlfriend, children, dogs in Keys","Steven Colella is accused of threatening to kill his girlfriend, her children and her dogs after she let the dogs inside her Key Largo home after mopping.

KEY LARGO, Fla. - A 29-year-old man wanted on a warrant in New York was arrested Tuesday night in Key Largo after threatening to kill his girlfriend, her children and her dogs, a sheriff's spokesman said.

Steven Colella faces charges of aggravated assault and providing a false name to law enforcement.

Monroe County Sheriff's Office spokesman Adam Linhardt said a deputy was called to a Key Largo gas station, where a clerk shared some text messages she received from a co-worker.

The co-worker's text messages claimed she was being threatened by her boyfriend, who said he was going to kill her, her children and her dogs.

When deputies went to the woman's home to conduct a welfare check, they found the door open and saw a woman near the doorway. They also saw a man near the kitchen.

The woman screamed, ""Put down the knife,"" but the man ran toward the back of the home.

Deputies ran after him and ordered him out of a back room with his hands up. He complied and was taken into custody.

The man, identified by deputies as Colella, said he had been arguing with his girlfriend but denied making any threats.

Linhardt said Colella gave deputies a phony name, date of birth and Social Security number. They later learned his true identity and that he was wanted on a parole violation in New York.

Colella's girlfriend said she was mopping the floor when she let the dogs inside, which enraged Colella. She told deputies Colella picked up a knife and threatened to kill the dogs.

""The girlfriend stated he gave his New York friend her identifying information so his associate could come to Key Largo, kill her and her family,"" Linhardt said. ""She stated the suspect has gang affiliations in New York.""

Colella was arrested and booked into jail. His girlfriend told deputies that, had they not arrived, she and her family would have died.

1396,Florida woman infatuated with Columbine shooting has been found dead by FBI,"Florida woman infatuated with Columbine shooting has been found dead by FBI Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Video

A young Florida woman who traveled to Colorado and bought a shotgun for what authorities feared would be a Columbine-inspired attack just days ahead of the 20th anniversary was found dead Wednesday in an apparent suicide after a nearly 24-hour manhunt.

Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader said 18-year-old Sol Pais was discovered by the FBI with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The manhunt had led to the closing of Denver-area schools as a precaution.

During the manhunt, the FBI said Pais was “infatuated” with Columbine and made threats ahead of Saturday’s anniversary of the attack that killed 13 people at Columbine High School in 1999. The FBI described her “extremely dangerous.”

The Miami Beach high school student flew to Colorado on Monday night and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition, authorities said.

“We deal with a lot of threats at Columbine,” John McDonald, executive director of security for the Jefferson County school system, said when the manhunt was over. “This one felt different. It was different. It certainly got our attention.”

Agents had focused the search around the base of Mount Evans, a popular recreational area about 60 miles southwest of Denver.

All classes and extracurricular activities for about a half-million students were canceled as a precaution, though sheriff’s spokesman Mike Taplin said the young woman’s threats were general and not specific to any school.

Authorities said Pais was last seen not far from Columbine — in the Jefferson County foothills outside Denver — in a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots. Police were instructed to detain her for a mental health evaluation.

In Pais’ hometown of Surfside, Florida, Police Chief Julio Yero asked that the family be given “privacy and a little time to grieve.”

“This family contributed greatly to this investigation from the very onset. They provided valuable information that led us to Colorado and a lot of things that assisted in preventing maybe more loss of life,” he said.

Pais’ parents last saw her on Sunday and reported her missing to Florida authorities on Monday night, Surfside police said.

Because of the threats, Columbine and more than 20 other schools outside Denver locked their doors for nearly three hours Tuesday afternoon, and some canceled evening activities or moved them inside.

Adam Charni, a Miami Beach High School senior, said Pais dressed in black and kept mostly to herself. He said he was “baffled” to learn she was the person authorities in Colorado were searching for.

1398,"Florida woman fends off 300-pound, half-naked attacker with baseball bat","GAINESVILLE, Fla. - A 65-year-old Florida woman wasn’t going to sit by and watch a man break into her car, according to Gainesville police, so she grabbed a bat and took matters into her own hands.

Clarese Gainey said she heard a noise outside her apartment and saw a man in his boxers tugging at her car door handle and knocking on the window, according to WGFL.

Before calling police, Gainey told WGFL she approached the burglar with a baseball bat.

""I grab my bat, I brace myself and I ease the door open,"" Gainey said.

Police said Antonio Mosely, who is 5 feet, 6 inches and weighs 300 pounds, charged the woman.

In response, Gainey hit the half-naked attacker in the head with her baseball bat, police said.

""I took that bat and hit him upside the head, like, 'Pi-yah!' he said, 'Ow!'"" Gainey said, describing the incident.

Mosely left behind his pants, shirt and a sock as he ran to a nearby mobile home park, and was later tracked down by a K-9 unit, according to police.

When police brought Mosely to Gainey for identification, she was able to identify him by his head injury.

1406,Ancestry.com removes ad romanticizing slavery,"Copyright by WFLA - All rights reserved

(WFLA/CNN Newsource) – Ancestry.com is apologizing for an advertisement that critics said romanticized slavery.

The video ad aired on television and was posted to YouTube.

It depicted a white man in the 1800s asking a black woman to escape to the north with him.

The man holds a ring in his left fingers.

As the video ends, a “marriage certificate” appears on the screen, saying the couple portrayed wed in Canada in 1857.

The ad was criticized for evoking images of slavery in the United States and a time when black women were subjugated and raped by white slave owners.

The DNA testing company said in a statement, “Ancestry is committed to telling important stories from history. This ad was intended to represent one of those stories. We very much intended to represent one of those stores. We very much appreciate the feedback we have received and apologize for any offense that the ad may have caused.”",http://www.wfla.com/news/viral-news/ancestrycom-removes-ad-romanticizing-slavery/1939548413,2019-04-19T21:14:28Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA",FL,33606
1407,Fort Myers police take suspect into custody after standoff,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Lee County on news-press.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

About three hours after a man suffered a bullet wound Friday, Fort Myers police used a battering ram to go into a Dunbar boarding house. Then they sent in a drone.

Not quite an hour later, Fort Myers Police said they had a suspect in custody.

Throughout the afternoon, police had swarmed and yelled through loudspeakers for those involved to leave a house, at 2081 Fountain St. near Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, with their hands up.

Teams of heavily-armed police had set up a perimeter around the neighborhood, monitoring it.

Police said the suspect fled to the boarding house after the shooting, and they had evacuated tenants. Onlookers stood outside filming with their phones until a downpour moved in, lasting about an hour.

A man who said he was a resident said police had detained a person from the boarding home earlier.

However, police continued to patrol the area, and SWAT team members and the Lee County Sheriff's Office Gang Unit entered the home around 6:15 p.m. Multiple officers went into the home carrying shields and battering rams, a small drone trailing behind them.

The Lee County Property Appraiser's Office said it is owned by The Charlie Walters Trust and has 13 units.

Police said the gunshot victim was at Lee Memorial Hospital Trauma Unit on Friday evening with non-life-threatening wound.

Police were reopening Fountain Street to normal traffic soon after 7 p.m. Officers had blocked the street from Lincoln Boulevard to Martin Luther King Boulevard.

The boarding house is a tiny, neat white building with about 2,500-square feet of living space and faces a vacant lot in the community filled with small, single-family homes.

Police asked motorists to avoid the area. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard is the path downtown Fort Myers workers take to Interstate 75 and to Lehigh Acres.

1409,"Paramedic, 23, left partially paralyzed after cracking her neck","A 23-year-old woman suffered a stroke after cracking her neck and accidentally rupturing a major artery, several news outlets reported this week.

Natalie Kunicki had been out that night, and at first, she misinterpreted her strange symptoms and thought she was just drunk, according to the Daily Mail.

Kunicki, who works as a paramedic in London, was watching a movie in bed with a friend when she stretched her neck and heard the loud cracking sound. When Kunicki got up about 15 minutes later, she collapsed and was unable to move her left leg.

Kunicki got over her initial embarrassment, she told the Daily Mail, and called for help. Considering her job as a paramedic, she said she realized at some point that this was serious.

She only hesitated to call for help because she didn’t want her co-workers to show up in an ambulance and find her “tipsy,” Kunicki said.

At the hospital, she learned that her vertebral artery had burst, which caused a blood clot to form in her brain and triggered the stroke, the Daily Mail reported.

Kunicki was shocked.

Slowly but surely, she’s now starting to gain back her mobility. But doctors aren’t sure if she’ll ever fully recover, according to published reports.

“I thought I had been drugged,” she said. “The date rape drug can cause paralysis. … I wasn't even trying to crack my neck. I just moved and it happened.”

Kunicki required three-hour emergency surgery once she was taken in to the hospital. That’s when doctors found her burst artery.

Surgeons were able to repair it with a stent, but they couldn’t clear the clot in her brain, the Daily Mail reported. Doctors do believe it will dissolve in time.

Kunicki’s left side was almost completely paralyzed by the stroke.

“(This) was just spontaneous and there's a one in a million chance of it happening,” Kunicki said. “I don't smoke, I don't really drink and I don't have any family history of strokes, so it's quite strange it happened to me when I was just moving in bed.”

She said she was depressed following the surgery due to losing so much of her independence but has been in better spirits lately.

Kunicki hopes to be back to work for “light duty” in six to 12 months.

She said she wants to raise awareness of strokes in young people.

Kunicki’s brother set up a GoFundMe page to help his sister pay for living expenses while she’s off work. It’s already met its goal.

1410,"Fort Myers police captain in sex tape scandal being investigated for perjury, other potential crimes","CLOSE A 2013 video obtained by the News-Press purportedly shows a high-ranking Fort Myers police officer engage in a sex act during an operation. Nudity, sexual images and utterances have been edited out. Special to the News-Press, Fort Myers News-Press

Gov. Ron DeSantis has reassigned two cases involving a high-ranking Fort Myers police officer involved in a sex tape scandal because of a potential conflict with the local state attorney.

Ed Brodsky, the state attorney for the 12th Judicial Circuit in Sarasota, has been assigned a case involving allegations of perjury and other potential crimes involving Capt. Jay Rodriguez, according to the executive order.

Meanwhile, Brian Haas, state attorney for the 10th Judicial Circuit based in Polk County, has been asked to review an extortion allegation in which Rodriguez contends he was blackmailed by a Fort Myers community activist.

Rodriguez, a 21-year veteran on the force, was placed on paid leave on Feb. 11 after a video surfaced purportedly showing him having sexual contact with a woman at a massage parlor during a prostitution sting in 2013.

Rodriguez declined to comment when reached on Thursday.

Soon after his suspension, Amira Fox, state attorney for the 20th Judicial Circuit, asked the governor's office to reassign the case because ""there exists a conflicting relationship between State Attorney Amira D. Fox and Mr. Rodriguez arising from the election in 2018.""

Campaign finance records show Rodriguez donated $100 to her election campaign last year. Fox declined to comment through a spokeswoman.

DeSantis issued the orders on March 8, which identified the criminal cases that were being investigated. The reason cited for the reassignment is Fox's ""close working relationship"" with the police department, the executive order states. It does not include the monetary donation to her campaign.

After Rodriguez was suspended, Police Chief Derrick Diggs asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to open a criminal investigation into the prostitution sting and the video.

The video was delivered to city officials on Feb. 8 by a former Fort Myers police detective who had filed a complaint in December.

O'Neil Kerr emailed the city's human resources director and told her of the sex tape's existence. In February, he was informed the video did not exist, but that if he had a copy, he should turn it over.

Kerr, who said the video was left in his mailbox, handed it over.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

The video purports to show a prostitution sting on March 14, 2013 that led to the arrest of two women. One of the women was charged with living off the earnings of prostitution, while the second woman was charged with soliciting prostitution.

The second woman, whose record is now expunged, is seen on camera accepting money from the officer believed to be Rodriguez before the sounds of a sexual act can be heard.

The incident seen on video does not match the summary in the arrest report, and the report makes no mention of the sting being recorded.

FDLE officials said the case remains under investigation.

Separately, the Fort Myers Police Department is investigating an extortion allegation Rodriguez made against community activist Anthony Thomas, claiming he threatened to make the video public if Rodriguez did not pay.

Thomas has previously denied the accusation.

Fort Myers police spokesman Mitch Haley said the case is also still being investigated.

Both investigations will be turned over to the newly assigned state attorneys once they are complete, and they will then decide whether to prosecute.

Anonymous complaints

While the investigations into the incident are ongoing, newly released documents show city officials were told a sex tape incriminating Rodriguez had existed long before Kerr reported it.

In response to a records request, the city released two letters that were sent to Diggs and city officials between August 2016 and October 2017.

The second letter, received in October 2017, refers to the existence of the tape and Rodriguez's alleged involvement.

Copies of the letter were hand-delivered to The News-Press. The city redacted the portion having to do with the sexual misconduct allegations.

The letters are riddled with mostly character attacks on specific police officers and staff, but resulted in four separate internal affairs investigations.

Three of the investigations, which involved alleged police misconduct, were unfounded, while one investigation remains open.

It's unclear if any of the investigations were related to the 2013 prostitution sting.

The unfounded investigations involved an officer pointing a gun at a family member, a domestic violence incident and sexual contact between an officer and minors participating in an outreach program.

Diggs has refused repeated requests for interviews relating to the letters and the discovery of the sex tape.

At a recent ""Coffee with a Cop"" event in east Fort Myers, Diggs said he stood by the internal affairs investigations on the previous complaints despite the discovery of the video.

""We investigate based on facts and what we know at the time,"" Diggs said. ""I am not revisiting any of those investigations. The investigations were completed.""

1412,Here's why I... wear a Make America Great Again cap | Opinion,"A supporter of then-candidate Donald Trump wears a Make America Great Again cap at a 2016 rally in Westfield, Indiana. (Photo: AP)

I wear a red cap bearing the words Make America Great Again in white letters and an American flag embroidered on the side.

Not MAGA. Too many snide captions can go with that one.

Not because I believe in or endorse all of President Trump's policies or remarks.

No, the reason I wear the hat is to try to get people into a calm and rational discussion of what it means to make America great again.

What does this truly mean? To me it means jobs available for those willing to study, receive an education and willing to work their way up to a better life.

What is the 'Here's why I series': Our executive editor explains

More from this series: I was called by faith to be a progressive

Opposing view: I'm a black woman and you can't disguise the hatred in 'Make America Great Again'

It does not mean a return to the days of yesteryear and segregation. It means equal opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, creed or religion. My own family is very diverse. My oldest son is half Mexican; one granddaughter is gay and married to an American of African descent, and has two children of color whom my wife and I adore. Another granddaughter is of Hispanic descent, and I was married to an Asian woman for 22 years.

Let me back up a little to tell you how where I came from helps define where I stand today, and why that cap means something to me.

I do consider myself to be one of the “privileged” people. I am the son of a hard-working father and loving mother. My dad worked 12 hours a night, seven days a week for the grand sum of $12 a week: true depression in northern Vermont.

When World War II started, my father picked up his family and moved to East Hartford, Connecticut, where he got a job at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft working as a machinist. He did so well that he was promoted to working on the engines for the mighty B-29 at the experimental machines shop.

My father taught me there is no such thing as a job too lowly to consider. As long as a job is legal, it can be a springboard to better things. I started work at the age of 16 as a part-time school custodian, working three hours a night after school and four hours on Saturday mornings. I worked with a Ukrainian immigrant for three years. He and I became great friends and when I applied for a job as circulation supervisor for the Hartford Courant newspaper, I had great references from my boss, teachers and the school principal.

I left the job in 1953 to join the Air Force. I attended weather school at Chanute AFB in Illinois and became a weather observer. After a tour in the western Pacific, I applied and was accepted for further training as a weather forecaster. I eventually rose to the rank of master sergeant and was assigned duty as the Wing Weather Officer for the 410th Bomb Wing in Michigan — a position normally held by a captain.

After my 20 years in the Air Force, I retired and became a tour bus driver, traveling to all the states east of the Mississippi River. Not the best-paying job in the world, but a very interesting one. I enjoyed it for 16 years, finally retiring to Florida in 1996.

So here is what that Make America Great Again slogan means to me: Let us have good jobs, even if we have to start at the bottom and work our way up.

I wear my hat proudly wherever I go and have yet to experience a negative comment or harsh glance. I have had many positive remarks such as ""Nice hat' or ""I like your hat.” The comments come from middle-aged and older folks from different backgrounds and races. An older man at a Ford dealership service department came all the way across the aisle to comment about the hat and inquire where I had purchased it.

My wife also wears the same type hat wherever she goes. She also has gotten many good comments from strangers.

Richard Bradley (Photo: Provided)

My take on Make America Great Again means, then, just that: greatness for all.

Good, honest labor never hurt anyone. Get the education you need for the position you desire. Strive to do your best even in a “dead-end” job. You will need those references.

If my hat offends you, I am sorry. But if you desire to have a dialogue with me in a reasonable way, I will be more than happy to oblige.

Air Force veteran Richard Bradley is retired and lives in Malabar.

According to the arrest report, Robert Jordan and the woman got into an argument at a home on the Southside. The woman went to get in her car and Jordan went back into the home. The woman returned later, saw the dog was injured and took the dog to a veterinarian, the arrest report shows.

The vet found the dog’s leg was so badly broken, it would need surgery or might have to be amputated, according to the arrest report.

Police said they questioned Jordan, who said he didn’t know how the dog was injured.

He was arrested because he was the last person with the dog, the report shows.

He was booked into the Duval County jail Monday and released the next day on $10,000 bond, according to online jail records.

An arrest report from the Alachua County Sheriff's Office said that on Sunday morning, 36-year-old Antonio Mosley attempted a burglary at a home on NE 12th Avenue in Gainesville. Law enforcement was called to the area after Mosley was observed trying to break into 65-year-old Elaine Clarese Gainey's vehicle.

Mosley was described to be in his underwear and wearing no shirt while doing this. He reportedly weighs about 300 pounds. Gainey confronted Mosley, but he charged at her while she stood in the open doorway of her residence. She feared that he was trying to gain entry into her home and harm her.

So, according to the arrest report, Gainey used a baseball bat to strike Mosley on the left side of his head and told him to get away from her. Gainey fled into a neighboring mobile home park, leaving behind his jeans, shirt, and a sock.

A K-9 reportedly tracked Mosley down, but by this time, he was wearing pants. A baggie of cocaine was found in his pockets. Mosley told law enforcement that he does not remember what happened, but he did identify the clothing left at the scene as his.

Mosley is being charged with attempted burglary of an occupied dwelling and possession of a controlled substance.

1428,"Saturday accident on State Road 40 kills three, injures two","An accident involving two vehicles on State Road 40 claimed the lives of at least three people Saturday afternoon.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers said the crash involved a head-on collision between a car and a pickup truck on State Road 40 near Southwest 133rd Avenue Road about 5:30 p.m.

Marion County Fire Rescue officials said that in addition to the fatalities, two people injured in the accident were taken to a local hospital in critical condition.

Kim Horton, a driver in another vehicle who witnessed the accident, said she was traveling west on SR 40 when she saw a car traveling east on SR 40 at an estimated speed of 100 mph. She said the driver lost control of the vehicle as it was approaching a curve, and she had to drive into a ditch to avoid being hit by him.

As the car was coming around the curve, it struck the pickup truck that was traveling in the opposite direction, she said. Upon impact, one person was ejected through a windshield and landed on the grass.

Horton said she and another woman in her vehicle stopped their car to help and tried to pull occupants of the crashed vehicles away from the accident.

Troopers on the scene said the two people traveling in the car died at the scene. Of the three people riding in the pickup truck, the driver was killed in the accident and the two other occupants were sent to Ocala Regional Medical Center, where they were listed in critical condition.

1430,Sheriffs oppose lawmakers attempt to toss mandatory sentencing from the books,"CLOSE The House sponsor on prison reform is unsure of senate plan James Call, Democrat Capitol Reporter

A band of reformers wants to negotiate dramatic changes to the state’s criminal justice system in the session’s final two weeks.

Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Naples, are behind efforts to reduce the nation's third-largest prison population.

They are among a bi-partisan group of lawmakers and activist organizations who want lawmakers to rethink policies that created three-strike laws, mandatory minimum sentences and a low threshold for felony offenses a generation ago. Together, those laws swelled the prison population to 96,000 and increased the Department of Corrections budget by nearly a billion dollars, to $2.4 billion.

Meanwhile, other states veered off the tough-on-crime road. They adopted other crime-fighting techniques in the past 20 years and have lowered both their crime rates and prison populations.

Florida keeps prisoners behind bars longer than the national average and has more returning inmates than other states. And despite all the money it spends on corrections, Florida prisons are dangerous places for staff and inmates.

Eight prison wardens in February told lawmakers because of low salaries, frequent overtime and poor working conditions, they can’t hire people. While the inmate population has increased by 12,000 prisoners in a decade, there are a 1,000 fewer guards, a situation the National Institute of Corrections called “dangerously understaffed.”

“The reality of the situation is, we cannot continue to overlook the fact that we don’t’ have the resources to fund the system that everyone wants to fund,” Donalds said about a failure to rehabilitate offenders. “We are just warehousing people. So, if you are actually going to help people to correct their lives . . . we have to reshape the system in a way that they can be full citizens when they come back.”

A reshaping appears to be taking place in the Senate, where Brandes has incorporated components of a few House bills into a package called the Florida First Step Act. It has attracted a bi-partisan network of support that includes the American Conservative Union, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.

It also has significant opposition from law enforcement.

The sheriff’s association, police chiefs and prosecutors are opposed to the bill. They argued that current Florida laws have produced a 50-year low in crime.

“Everything we are talking about are things pretty much put in place by your predecessors in the Legislature because of the high crime rate we had over the years,” Buddy Jacobs, of the Florida Prosecutors Association told a Senate panel.

“Things on the books are there for a reason,” said Jacobs.

But the reformers countered other states get better results at lower cost.

In the face of law enforcement objections, Brandes went on the offensive and produced a 350-page amendment on a Monday night, including House provisions. He then chaperoned the bill through two Senate committees in three days with a combined vote of 25-2. By week’s end he seemed to relish the upcoming floor debates and negotiations with the House.

“This is the first step of turning the Department of Warehousing back into the Department of Corrections,” said Brandes about a proposal he’s worked in some fashion for more than five years.

The plan would impose a higher threshold for a felony offense, reduce the number of mandatory minimum sentences and create alternatives to jail. The money saved with a lower prison population would be diverted to services like counseling, education and job training.

An ACU spokesman said the reforms have proved in other states that incarceration rates can be lowered without a risk to public safety. David Safavian said they are a way to hold government accountable for the money spent and results produced.

The first step is to revisit the idea of mandatory minimum sentences.

Because of the more than 150 offenses carrying mandatory sentences, and a requirement to serve 85 percent of a sentence, Florida keeps prisoners longer, time served is 38 percent more than the national average. Critics says mandatory sentences are counterproductive, abused by prosecutors and undermine public confidence in the system.

An NRA representative told a Senate panel about a woman who claimed self-defense when she fired a gun. When she refused a plea bargain, Melissa Alexander ended up in prison because of the 10-20-life law.

“If you have a non-violent or first-time offender and you lock him in for a long time with violent and repeat offenders he’s going to come out looking like the others,” said Safavian.

“Judges should be empowered to look at all the facts and circumstances in the case and figure out what is a just sentence, and not just what is the harshest,” said Safavian. He argued mandatory sentences turn judges into “tabulators” rather than arbiters of justice.

Brandes said the ultimate crime fighter is a job and that the proposals put offenders into a better position to find employment.

“If you want to see the number-one correlation between recidivism and incarceration (it is) the ability to get a job,” said Brandes.

To that end, SB 642 would lift the prohibition on certain professional licensing after a felon completes a sentence.

“The simple truth is you can be a barber in prison for five years and you can’t come out of prison and be a barber,” said Brandes. “We need to allow people to focus on getting a job. There’s a direct correlation between having a job and not committing crimes.”

Brandes proposes the money saved from alternatives to jail for nonviolent offenders be spent on education, counseling and job training. Former inmates told lawmakers once behind bars, they never saw services judges promised at sentencing.

Paula Hill's experience in prison led her to ask lawmakers what do they want the criminal justice system to accomplish?

“Is the system there to rehabilitate us or is the system there to abuse us, and corrupt us, and demean us,” said Hill, who served time for felony theft.

“I’ve been there. We need to get us a (new) system,” said Hill.

Brandes sprung the strike-all amendment in the seventh week of a nine-week session. The omnibus package is known as a train because it addresses a wide variety of issues including regulations of the sale of horse meat, possession of a liquor still, along with allowing Supreme Court justices who don’t live in Leon County an office in the county courthouse where they live.

But much of the focus is on the provisions to do away with mandatory sentencing and raising the felony threshold for theft from $300 to $1,000 - a move to reduce the number of felons entering the system.

Rep. Ramon Alexander, D-Tallahassee, has championed both ideas during his two terms in office. But because of the proposal's late appearance, he is eyeing it with a watchdog stare.

He said stuff can be thrown into a 400-page document that changes everything.

“In this process things can change at the drop of a hat. We have to be fully aware of that,” said Alexander. “It's on the table and there is room to move it forward... what is in it will determine my vote.""

Law enforcement wants the repeal of mandatory minimums taken out, arguing that the sentencing system is working. The associations for the sheriffs, police chiefs and prosecutors argued against a plan to allow good behavior to reduce prison time as low as 65 percent of sentence.

“Truth in sentencing matters,” said Matt Dunagan of the Florida Sheriffs Association.

That prompted Sen. Darryl Rouson, D-Tampa, to ask whether Dunagan knew of any case of a mandatory sentence creating an injustice.

“In regard to mandatory minimums we believe there is some consistency across the board. When dealing with overall sentencing, ensuring that people serve their full time is good policy,” said Dunagan.

Brandes has two weeks to get his proposal to the governor's desk.

""Session really started this week,"" he said Wednesday. ""This is when everything gets negotiated. But my goal, and I think the House's goal is we take the first step on criminal justice reform.""

1437,"Rattlesnake captured in yard, then moved to Reptile World Serpentarium 'venom line'","CLOSE Steven Henson, who works for Florida Wildlife Trappers of Cocoa, strapped a video camera on his snake tongs to film the apprehension of a rattlesnake Rick Neale, FLORIDA TODAY

Coiled quietly beneath saw palmetto bushes, the eastern diamondback rattlesnake awaited prey near a bird feeder in Lori Parsons' backyard — until one of her startled dogs startled barking at it.

Soon after, confronted by a trapper, the snake shook its rattle as a noisy warning — to no avail. It was seized by tongs, lifted into the air, placed inside a nylon bag, and transported to Reptile World Serpentarium.

Now, the 5-foot rattler occupies a gray rectangular plastic container on the St. Cloud serpentarium's ""venom line.""

Living on a diet of dead rats, the fanged reptile's venom will be harvested, freeze-dried and shipped to New Zealand, where it will create antivenin used to treat snakebite victims in hospital emergency rooms.

""It was just such a magnificent beast. We certainly didn't want to kill it. I know a lot of people chop their heads off,"" Parsons said.

""We weren't trying to kill this animal that was just trying to survive,"" she said.

Rattlesnake in the yard

Parsons lives in Wedgefield, a small rural community south of Bithlo in eastern Orange County. She feared for the safety of her dogs, Layla and Chelsea, after the rattler's initial appearance.

""It came onto our porch about a month ago, and it was slithering along our screen room and the dogs found it. My husband went out to see what they were barking at and saw the snake,"" Parsons recalled.

""He called me and said, 'We've got this snake in the yard.' And I could hear the rattle through his cell phone and my cell phone — that's how loud the rattle was. It was frightening,"" she said.

Friday, Parsons' son spotted the serpent coiled beneath a clump of palmettos in her backyard. Layla was outside, barking at the concealed snake.

Parsons called Florida Wildlife Trappers of Cocoa. Melbourne resident Steven Henson, a veteran trapper, drove to the scene and captured the pit viper. He described the snake as aggressive and energetic.

In June 2014, Henson made news by netting Sushi, a juvenile bull shark that mysteriously appeared in the large freshwater pond at Gleason Park in Indian Harbour Beach.

Hundreds of spectators and a television news helicopter watched the action — and now every June, the city organizes a Shark in the Park 5K race.

Threatened by humans

The eastern diamondback rattlesnake is one of six venomous snake species found throughout the Sunshine State, including barrier islands and the Keys.

Rattlesnakes prefer areas with palmetto scrub, and they can slither into gopher tortoise burrows during winter, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reports.

However, a severe decline in rattlesnake population can be attributed to agricultural development, urban sprawl and commercial hunting, the Florida Museum of Natural History reports.

Reptile World Serpentarium opened in 1972 in St. Cloud. Touted by a large cobra sign facing U.S. 192, the facility houses more than 80 snake species along with alligators, dozens of turtles, iguanas and fellow cold-blooded critters.

George Van Horn founded and owns the Old Florida-style roadside attraction. His serpentarium hosts daily ""venom shows"" at noon and 3 p.m., where spectators watch him ""milk"" deadly snakes by extracting their venom into collecting glasses.

""If you live down here, this will not be news to you: There is no conservation going on in the state of Florida,"" Van Horn said while describing eastern diamondback rattlesnakes during the 3 p.m. Wednesday venom show.

""I always had a feeling if I would go up and break into the governor's office, and sneak in there and look under his desk, I'd see a little binder that said, 'Bulldoze it. Build it. Sell it. And move on,' "" Van Horn said.

""I grew up in Florida, and I'm watching it go down the tubes. Every time I turn around, they go out and bulldoze another 2,000, 3,000 acres of land down to sugar sand,"" he said.

Venom used to save lives

Every year, 7,000 to 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only five fatalities are recorded in a typical year.

Reptile World Serpentarium has provided venom to researchers and universities around the world. Van Horn said the venom line houses roughly 540 deadly snakes, including 125 rattlesnakes. They are milked every 20 days or so — the rattler captured in Parsons' yard made its venom show debut Saturday.

The serpentarium collects and sells about 1 kilogram of freeze-dried rattlesnake venom every year, Van Horn said. Venom is shipped to New Zealand, where technicians inject small doses into sheep. In turn, the sheep produce antibodies that neutralize snake toxins.

CLOSE Reptile World Serpentarium owner George Van Horn and David Bledsoe, exhibit curator, milk two rattlesnakes during an April 17 ""venom show."" Rick Neale, FLORIDA TODAY

Sheep blood is shipped to Wales, where these antibodies are purified, processed and shipped as antivenin to U.S. hospital pharmacies, Van Horn told the venom show crowd.

""It turns out snake venom proteins have been extremely valuable research tools in just about every aspect of physiology study,"" Van Horn said.

""We use venom components to learn about blood chemistry, cell structure, disease mechanisms, genetics, neurobiology,"" he said.

Van Horn told spectators colorful snake stories: the young man who was bitten twice by a coral snake he caught on a Melbourne Beach sand dune; the retired Orlando woman who was shocked by a $962,000 hospital bill after a pygmy rattlesnake bit her foot in her yard.

Asked about pythons in the Everglades, Van Horn said the fearsome reptiles are here to stay — ""they can nuke the Everglades, but the pythons would probably be the only ones left,"" he quipped.

""I understand people get excited about snakes. But the worst invasive species to hit Florida, you see him in the mirror every morning.""

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - A woman was arrested for a hit-and-run crash that left another woman dead in Tampa last week, according to police.

The incident occurred at about 8:45 p.m. on April 10 in the area of Nebraska Avenue and 112th Avenue E.

According to police, the victim was riding a moped northbound on Nebraska Avenue when she hit a pedestrian and was ejected from the bike. She landed in the roadway and was struck by a passing vehicle, which failed to stop. The woman later died from her injuries.

Nereida Rosario, 64, was arrested Wednesday in connection with her death. Police said her vehicle had front end damage and matched the description that witnesses provided.

Rosario allegedly admitted to driving her vehicle in the area at that time, police said.

She faces a charge of leaving the scene of a crash.

1445,Threat by Florida woman with gun shuts Denver-area schools,"LITTLETON, Colo. - Denver-area public schools will be closed Wednesday as authorities search for a young Florida woman who flew to the city and bought a gun after becoming “infatuated” with the mass shooting at Columbine High School.

The FBI said Sol Pais, 18, is “considered to be extremely dangerous” and “made threats to commit an act of violence in the Denver metropolitan area” just days before the 20th anniversary of the attack that killed 13 people.

All schools in the Denver area were urged to tighten security because the threat was deemed “credible and general,” said Patricia Billinger, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Columbine and more than 20 other schools outside Denver lock their doors for nearly three hours Tuesday afternoon before Wednesday’s complete closures were announced.

The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and the FBI say Pais traveled to Colorado from Miami on Monday night and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition.

Denver Public Schools said that all facilities and programs will be closed Wednesday, and there will be no afternoon activities or athletic competitions. The district said the decision to close campuses was in collaboration with other Denver metro-area school districts due to the ongoing safety concern.

Authorities said Tuesday they are looking for a young woman who is ""infatuated"" with the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado and made threats just days before the 20th anniversary of the attack that killed 13 people. (April 17)

On Tuesday, some schools released their students after additional security was called in and canceled evening activities or moved them inside.

“We always have heightened awareness close to high-profile anniversaries like this,” Billinger said.

Authorities said Pais was last seen near Columbine -- in the Jefferson County foothills outside Denver -- wearing a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots. They appealed for anyone seeing her to call an FBI tip line at 303 630-6227, and said she is too dangerous to be approached by civilians. The alert also said police who come into contact with her should detain her and evaluate her mental health.

“This has become a massive manhunt ... and every law enforcement agency is participating and helping in this effort,” Dean Phillips, special agent in charge of the FBI in Denver, said late Tuesday night.

The FBI’s Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force issued a notice Tuesday describing Pais as “infatuated with (the) Columbine school shooting.”

Sheriff’s spokesman Mike Taplin said the threats she made were general and not specific to any school.

The Denver Post reported that a call to a phone number listed for Pais’ parents in Surfside, Florida, was interrupted by a man who identified himself as an FBI agent and said he was interviewing them.

Surfside Police Sgt. Marian Cruz confirmed that her parents last saw her on Sunday and reported her missing on Monday. The Miami Herald and WTVJ are reporting that neighbors say the teen is a senior at Miami Beach High School.

The Associated Press left messages at two numbers listed for Pais’ relatives in Florida, while another number was disconnected.

GAINESVILLE — When a Florida woman heard a noise and saw a man trying to break into her car early Sunday, she took matters into her own hands.

Clarese Gainey, 65, of Gainesville tells WGFL that she picked up her softball bat early Sunday, braced herself and eased open the door before hitting Antonio Mosley.

""I took that bat and hit him upside the head, like 'pi-yah,' ""Gainey said, adding that the 5-foot-6, 300-pound man said, ""Ow!""

Mosely ran to a nearby mobile home park, leaving behind his pants, shirt, and a sock, police said. A K-9 unit tracked him down, and Gainey said she easily identified him because of the knot on his head.

Gainey says she played softball in high school and can still swing a bat.

""He better be glad I didn't have a gun,"" Gainey said. ""Because I would have shot him.""

1465,"Woman spray paints neighbor's truck because she was sick of seeing it in street, deputies say","LAKE COUNTY, Fla. - An 82-year-old woman is accused of driving her golf cart to her neighbor's house to spray paint his truck because she was sick of seeing it parked in the street, according to the Lake County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies said the victim heard a knock on the door of his Sea Fern Drive home, but by the time he went to answer, all he saw was Margaret Moore driving away on her golf cart.

The man went outside and saw there was red spray paint on his windshield, driver's door window and driver's side exterior mirror as well as on the paint of his truck as well, the report said. The victim estimated that it would cost $400 to repair the damage.

Deputies said that when they went to Moore's home on Key West Drive, she refused to answer the door telling the deputy, ""Go away, I am not available to speak at the moment.""

Moore called 911 saying that the deputy was harassing her and when she was patched to his cellphone, she finally answered the door, according to the affidavit.

The deputy told Moore that he wanted to ask if she witnesses a crime and she replied, ""I'm not a witness to anything, you are here because I spray painted that guy's truck,"" the report said.

When asked why she did it, Moore said, ""Because he knows he isn't supposed to park his truck and trailer in the street and I am sick of it, I'm sick of seeing it and I'm sick of the park doing nothing about it,"" according to authorities.

Moore is accused of then trying to slap the deputy as he tried to arrest her, but he moved in time to avoid being hit.

She was arrested on charges of criminal mischief and resisting a law enforcement officer without violence.

LITTLETON, Colo. — Denver-area public schools closed Wednesday as the FBI hunted for an armed young Florida woman who was allegedly ""infatuated"" with Columbine and threatened violence just days ahead of the 20th anniversary of the attack.

Sol Pais, an 18-year-old Miami Beach high school student, flew to Colorado on Monday night and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition, the FBI and the sheriff's department said.

All classes and extracurricular activities for about a half-million students were canceled as a precaution. Sheriff's spokesman Mike Taplin said the young woman's threats were general and not specific to any school.

""This has become a massive manhunt ... and every law enforcement agency is participating and helping in this effort,"" said Dean Phillips, agent in charge of the FBI in Denver.

The FBI said Pais is ""considered to be extremely dangerous"" and ""made threats to commit an act of violence in the Denver metropolitan area"" ahead of Saturday's anniversary of the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School that killed 13 people.

The FBI described Pais as ""infatuated"" with the Columbine school shooting.

Authorities said Pais was last seen not far from Columbine — in the Jefferson County foothills outside Denver — in a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots. They appealed for anyone seeing her to call an FBI tip line at (303) 630-6227.

The alert also said police who come into contact with her should detain her and evaluate her mental health.

Because of the threat, Columbine and more than 20 other schools outside Denver locked their doors for nearly three hours Tuesday afternoon, and some canceled evening activities or moved them inside.

""We always have heightened awareness close to high-profile anniversaries like this,"" said Patricia Billinger, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Safety.

Messages left by The Associated Press at two numbers listed for Pais' relatives in Florida were not immediately returned, while another number was disconnected.

Two teenage gunmen attacked Columbine on April 20, 1999, killing 12 classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives.

1475,Column: 5 affordable and environmentally friendly gadgets to help reduce waste in the kitchen,"CLOSE Throwing away bad food is not just costing you money and wasting the food itself but is wasting the water and energy it took to produce the food and bring it to market. Here are a few ways you can help reduce food waste for Earth Day and year-round. Heather Rayhorn

Editor's note: This column was originally published in the April issue SWFL Parent & Child magazine.

Making the switch toward a more environmentally friendly lifestyle takes time and patience. It takes breaking bad habits and having a new mindset.

Loving the unloved: Naples woman fights beauty standards for fruits, vegetables

In all areas of our life, there are many methods to reduce waste. It could be as simple as finally recycling that pile of old magazines in the corner, or as complex as starting a compost pile in the backyard.

Here are five reusable household gizmos that not only help reduce waste, but also save money and time. Prices for these items range from less than $10 to close to $50. But when you think about the long-lasting effects of making the switch, the value far outweighs the cost.

These helpful alternatives will us get one step closer to a greener planet.

Sustainable food wraps

I’ve reached a point in my green journey where just about any single-use plastic drives me up the wall. That includes Ziploc bags. I used to be a heavy user. Packing carrots in my lunch? Ziploc. Need to store half an onion I didn’t use? Ziploc.

As an alternative, I may use leftover containers (glass is always preferable to plastic Tupperware, of course).

But when space is an issue (in the fridge or in the lunchbox), purchase a pack of sustainable food wraps. I like the ones from a company called Bees Wrap, which are made from beeswax, organic cotton, organic jojoba oil and tree resin. The wraps will seal and conform to the shape of whatever food you’re wrapping. Plus, they come in fun, colorful prints and a variety of sizes (buy the variety pack for $45 and get them all).

When you’re finished, simply wash the wrap with cool water and a mild dish soap and let it air dry for the next use.

Mesh produce bags

I assume by now you’ve already ditched plastic sacks and have committed to bringing reusable canvas bags to the grocery store, right? Good. Take it a step further and use reusable produce bags to cut out those single-use sacks that shoppers often use to package fruits, vegetables and herbs.

In many cases, you don’t even need them. Things like lemons and limes, onions and potatoes — food that we don’t bother to eat the skins of — can just jostle around inside your cart and on the checkout belt.

But for those produce that we do eat the skins of (apples, cucumbers and bell peppers, for example), I’ve started using mesh produce bags I bought on Amazon.com. The brand is called Earthwise, and they come in a couple different sizes. Nine of them cost $14. These are lightweight and see-through, so scanning them at check-out is no problem.

Silicone baking mats

I used to be a big fan of using aluminum foil or parchment paper on my baking sheets to make clean-up easy. But then I started to realize how much of it just got thrown away in the garbage, and how many rolls of the stuff I was constantly buying at the grocery store.

So then I turned to food-grade silicone baking mats.

Silpat is the leading brand, which you can find at most major distributors, including at Bed Bath & Beyond, Sur La Table and Macy’s (and good ‘ol Amazon.com). These mats can be used in the oven, microwave and freezer, and the non-stick coating allows your food (savory or baked goods) to bake evenly and slip right off without the use of oils, butters or sprays.

Then, use a soft sponge to wash your silicone mat to prevent damage.

Stainless-steel straws

There has been a big push recently to cut back on the use of single-use plastic straws. Many diners have decided to simply opt out, kindly asking restaurants and coffee shops to skip on the straw that comes with their drink.

But if you’re like me and having a hard time giving a straw up, invest in a set of reusable ones. I like the stainless-steel straws because they stay ice cold and are thin and long enough to fit in most any lid of a reusable cup (even Yetis!). I try to keep one or two in my purse and in my car for when I’m at a restaurant or pulling through a drive-thru.

This set of eight straws also comes with two flexible wire brushes get a thorough clean.

Reusable K-Cups

Even our morning coffee ritual can be greener. You love your Keurig coffee maker, but you probably don’t realize how much plastic you’re tossing in the landfill when you use single-use K-Cups. A reusable version made of BPA-free and eco-friendly stainless-steel allows you to brew your own ground coffee. Simply fill the basket with your own grounds, and after each use wash it in soapy water or load it in the dishwasher.

The K-Cup replacements from iPartsPlusMore are available on Amazon.com for $10 for a four pack. These are compatible with all Keurig versions, and you don’t even need to replace the filter holder.

1478,Coral snake spared the machete in Melbourne,"An undated handout photo released by biologist Mark Bailey Monday, June 29, 2009 shows a coral snake seen central Alabama. The snake is rare, especially north of Alabama's Coastal Plain. (AP Photo/via Conservation Southeast, Mark Bailey)

MELBOURNE, Fla. - Michelle Redfern's first instinct when she saw a 2-foot coral snake slithering in her garage Wednesday morning was to grab a machete or start the rhyme. ""Red touches Black, Friend of Jack; Red touches Yellow, Kill a Fellow ...""

""Black on yellow, deadly fellow ... Oh God, it's an actual coral snake,"" she thought.

Her husband was barefoot and wearing boxers in the garage at her home in Magnolia Park in Melbourne, News 6 partner Florida Today reported.

""I grabbed my boots and machete and assessed the situation, and then I used the machete to scoop it into the pitcher,"" she said.

Redfern, owner of the popular Kona Ice of Central Brevard Co. Truck, says the only time she's seen a coral snake was at a zoo.

""I spent some time in Texas, and rattlesnakes are big and scary, but I know that coral snakes don't strike,"" she said.

She actually had a turn of heart and ended up rescuing and relocating the venomous snake.

Her husband, William Navarro II, helped out, too.

""He was my driver and cameraman,"" she joked.

""We actually saved it from a neighborhood cat the second time around,"" she said. ""At which point, we felt, for the sake of both animals, we'd handle the situation. We didn't want to kill the coral snake because, being a native Florida resident, this was the first time having the opportunity to come up close and personal with such a beautiful creature.""

This particular coral snake, known as the eastern coral snake, is among the six most dangerous snakes in Florida, which has 44 species. While its bite is serious and should receive immediate medical attention, fatalities are rare. Coral snakes generally do not bite and if they do, it is often a dry bite or they inject a very low volume of venom.

It's quite rare to see one in a housing area.

""We believe that with a lot of debris being cleared from the Hibiscus Road recently, this snake may have been forced out of its natural habitat. Live and let live.""

1482,"Armed Florida teen obsessed with Columbine school shooting is found dead, ending manhunt for Sol Pais","A young Florida woman who traveled to Colorado and bought a shotgun for what authorities feared would be a Columbine-inspired attack just days ahead of the 20th anniversary was found dead Wednesday after a nearly 24-hour manhunt.

LITTLETON, Colo. — A young Florida woman who authorities say was so ""infatuated"" with the Columbine school shooting they feared she was planning an attack in Colorado just days ahead of the 20th anniversary was found dead Wednesday in an apparent suicide after a nearly 24-hour manhunt.

Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader said 18-year-old Sol Pais was discovered by the FBI with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The manhunt had led to the closing of Denver-area schools as a precaution, with classes and extracurricular activities canceled for a half-million students.

During the urgent search, the FBI said Pais was obsessed with the 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School and made threats ahead of Saturday's anniversary of the attack that killed 13 people. The FBI described her as ""extremely dangerous.""

The Miami Beach high school student flew to Colorado on Monday night and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition from a gun shop in Littleton, not far from Columbine, authorities said.

""We're used to threats, frankly, at Columbine,"" John McDonald, executive director of security for the Jefferson County school system, said when the manhunt was over. ""This one felt different. It was different. It certainly had our attention.

Authorities gave no immediate details on where Pais was found, but FBI agents had focused the search around the base of Mount Evans, a popular recreation area about 60 miles southwest of Denver.

McDonald described her trip as a ""pilgrimage"" to Columbine and cited her purchase of the shotgun as one reason officials took her as a serious threat.

""Those two things combined with her fascination of Columbine — that's pretty clear and convincing evidence that she was a threat to the school,"" he said.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said after receiving word that the hunt was over that he and all Colorado parents are ""hugging their children a little tighter.""

Authorities said Pais was last seen not far from Columbine — in the Jefferson County foothills outside Denver — in a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots. Police were instructed to detain her for a mental health evaluation.

In Pais' hometown of Surfside, Florida, Police Chief Julio Yero asked that the family be given ""privacy and a little time to grieve.""

""This family contributed greatly to this investigation from the very onset. They provided valuable information that led us to Colorado and a lot of things that assisted in preventing maybe more loss of life,"" he said.

Pais' parents last saw her on Sunday and reported her missing to Florida authorities on Monday night, Surfside police said.

Authorities said her threats were not specific to any school. But Columbine and more than 20 other schools outside Denver reacted by locking their doors for nearly three hours Tuesday afternoon, and some canceled evening activities or moved them inside.

Jefferson County school officials said events planned to mark the anniversary this weekend will go on as scheduled, including a ceremony at Columbine on Saturday.

Two teenage gunmen attacked Columbine on April 20, 1999, killing 12 classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives.

Adam Charni, a Miami Beach High School senior, said Pais dressed in black and kept mostly to herself. He said he was ""baffled"" to learn she was the person authorities in Colorado were searching for.

Colorado state Rep. Patrick Neville, the Republican House minority leader, was a 15-year-old sophomore at Columbine High at the time of the shooting and now has three school-age daughters.

""It wasn't easy for me to explain to my kids what was going on last night,"" Neville said on the House floor Wednesday.

1488,Woman 'infatuated' by Columbine shooting found dead of self-inflicted gunshot wound,"CLOSE Sol Pais, the 18-year-old woman ""infatuated"" with Columbine, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. USA TODAY

DENVER — After a massive one-day manhunt, a woman allegedly infatuated with the Columbine mass shooting is dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Sol Pais, who made ""credible threats"" against Denver-area schools four days before the 20th anniversary of Columbine High School shooting, fatally shot herself, Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference.

The 18-year-old South Florida woman flew Monday night from Miami to Colorado, and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition at a gun shop in the Littleton area, not far from Columbine High School, Shrader added.

Her actions prompted officials to put schools across the Denver area - including Columbine - on lockdown, but they are now set to reopen Thursday.

""We are relieved that the threat to our schools and our community is no longer present,"" said Jefferson County Public Schools Superintendent Jason Glass. ""While this threat has been the most significant, it's not the only challenge facing our schools and our community in these days leading up to the Columbine anniversary.

""I appreciate our community's patience as we continue to navigate these difficult issues.""

Pais' death capped a search launched the previous night after Pais, dressed in camouflage pants and black boots, disappeared in the foothills west of Denver. Officials from Florida and Colorado coordinated together for the investigation after her ""concerning comments"" about Columbine drew their attention.

John McDonald, executive director of safety and security for the school district, said administrators are used to threats at Columbine, but this one “felt different, was different and certainly had our attention.”

“We know that Columbine continues to attract people from around the world. And if I have any message: We’re not a place to come visit if you’re not a student. If you don’t have business there, we’re not a tourist attraction and we’re not a place for you to come and be an inspiration.”

Pais was a senior at Miami Beach Senior High School. She was said to be reserved and enrolled in Advancement Placement classes.

From Surfside, Florida, where Pais lived with her family, Police Chief Julio Yero said, ""I would like to express the family’s grief for this situation. They are grateful that no one else is hurt.”

He commended the FBI, law enforcement in Colorado and even the Pais family for their work to find the teen.

Anniversary: For Columbine survivors, life is about finding 'that new normal' 20 years later

“The collaboration probably prevented a tragedy,"" Yero said. ""This family contributed greatly to this investigation from the very onset. They provided us valuable information that led us to Colorado.”

Pais appears to have purchased the gun legally. Representatives from the Colorado gun shop that sold the firearm to Pais said the woman passed a background check from both the Federal Bureau of Investigation system and Colorado Bureau of Investigation.

“We had no reason to suspect she was a threat to either herself or anyone else,” Josh Rayburn, owner of Colorado Gun Broker wrote. “We are very sorry to hear of the outcome in this situation. It is never good when someone loses their life. We are playing for her family. And are very thankful this situation did not escalate into a public tragedy.”

It appears Pais also had an interest in guns.

One person identified as “Sol Pais” ran an online blog that included pictures of guns and journal entries filled with angst and other disturbing messages.

""The purpose of this site is for me to give insight into the thoughts I rarely, if ever, share with others, while remaining somewhat anonymous. Everything from journal entries to my personal interests - I want to leave a record of myself before I, well..."" the blog says.

In the ""About me"" section, the individual wrote, “I am the face of loneliness and misery.” USA TODAY was not able to independently confirm that the blog belonged to Pais.

A person with the same screen name, ""dissolvedgirl,"" posted on a National Gun Forum message board about living in Miami and traveling to Colorado to buy a gun. Law enforcement did not say whether the person was Pais.

Pais' parents reported her missing Monday night, according to the Surfside Police Department.

The FBI’s Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force issued a notice Tuesday that said police who come into contact with Pais should detain her and evaluate her mental health.

Sheriff’s spokesman Mike Taplin said the threats she made were general and not specific to any Colorado school.

The Denver, Douglas County and Cherry Creek school districts called off Wednesday classes, activities and athletics at all schools late Tuesday night, citing ""safety concerns related to a credible threat against schools in the area.""

The Jefferson County School District, which includes Columbine, also called off classes for Wednesday.

Earlier, authorities released several photos of Pais, described as having brown hair and sometimes wearing glasses.

April 20 is an emotional date for many Denver-area parents and students because it's the anniversary of the Columbine shooting in which two students killed 12 of their classmates and a coach before killing themselves. There's typically an uptick in threats made to schools around that date every year.

LITTLETON, Colo. — Denver-area public schools closed Wednesday as the FBI hunted for an armed young Florida woman who was allegedly ""infatuated"" with Columbine and threatened violence just days ahead of the 20th anniversary of the attack.

Sol Pais, an 18-year-old Miami Beach high school student, flew to Colorado on Monday night and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition, the FBI and the sheriff's department said.

All classes and extracurricular activities for about a half-million students were canceled as a precaution. Sheriff's spokesman Mike Taplin said the young woman's threats were general and not specific to any school.

""This has become a massive manhunt ... and every law enforcement agency is participating and helping in this effort,"" said Dean Phillips, agent in charge of the FBI in Denver.

The FBI said Pais is ""considered to be extremely dangerous"" and ""made threats to commit an act of violence in the Denver metropolitan area"" ahead of Saturday's anniversary of the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School that killed 13 people.

The FBI described Pais as ""infatuated"" with the Columbine school shooting.

Authorities said Pais was last seen not far from Columbine — in the Jefferson County foothills outside Denver — in a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots. They appealed for anyone seeing her to call an FBI tip line at (303) 630-6227.

The alert also said police who come into contact with her should detain her and evaluate her mental health.

Because of the threat, Columbine and more than 20 other schools outside Denver locked their doors for nearly three hours Tuesday afternoon, and some canceled evening activities or moved them inside.

""We always have heightened awareness close to high-profile anniversaries like this,"" said Patricia Billinger, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Safety.

Messages left by The Associated Press at two numbers listed for Pais' relatives in Florida were not immediately returned, while another number was disconnected.

Two teenage gunmen attacked Columbine on April 20, 1999, killing 12 classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives.

1494,Woman accused of abandoning pets in feces-covered apartment,"SOUTH DAYTONA, Fla. - South Daytona police are searching for a woman who they said abandoned her dog and cat inside a feces-covered apartment for days.

Authorities said neighbors, like Corrie Martinez, called Friday to complain about the woman's fire alarm going off, which sparked the animal neglect investigation.

The dog was removed from the home.

""He was so frail. He was real little. His face was just sunken in. You can tell he hadn't eaten. Hadn't been out, and his bark wasn't the same,"" Martinez said.

She said she heard the dog barking for a week and rarely saw the owner.

""When she popped in, it was always, 'I don't have my key, I don't have my key. Can you help me through the window?' That's what arose the question as to who's taking care of the dog,"" she said.

Officers searched the wrecked apartment off South Palmetto Avenue and rescued the mastiff that was barking upstairs, then returned to look for the cat, which they could not find. News 6 spotted the feline Tuesday afternoon and notified law enforcement, who returned to rescue the cat.

The property owner's employee told police the woman hasn't paid her rent and won't answer the phone. Officers tried calling the woman and her mother but to no avail. Meanwhile, neighbors are relieved the animals were rescued.

""If you don't want the dog, get rid of it. Give it to somebody who can take care of it, but you don't just leave the dog in the house by itself to die. It's like a child. You don't do that,"" Martinez said.

Police department officials said the woman will face charges of animal cruelty and abandoning or confining an animal without food or water.

1495,Accused car thief who said ‘demons took it' found not competent for trial,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A woman accused of stealing an SUV from an Ace Rent a Car on Jacksonville's Northside who told News4Jax ""the demons took it"" has been ruled not competent for trial, court records show.

Accepting a report from the psychologist who examined Gardinia McCollough, the judge found her not competent for prosecution, according to Duval County court records.

She will have a mental competency review in July.

McCollough, 23, was arrested March 7 on a car theft charge.

Police said employees of the rental car company found McCullough with the SUV less than a mile away at the Travelodge Inn and Suites on Airport Road.

Surveillance cameras of the business caught a woman wearing the same clothing at the front desk. Moments later, a white Toyota RAV4 is seen being driven away.

Marly Rose, the assistant general manager of the company, said the woman was upset because they were overbooked. At the Travelodge Inn and Suites, the woman who was next to the SUV spoke to News4Jax.

""Demons told me to do it,"" she said. ""I didn't take it, the demons took it.""

She continued, ""I tried to rent it, but y'all didn't want to rent me a car. Y'all talking about how y'all didn't have any cars to rent so I stole y'all's (expletive).""

When police officers arrived, the woman hid in a hotel room. Officers eventually got into her room, put her in handcuffs and placed her in a patrol car.

On March 28, arraignment was held for McCollough, who pleaded not guilty.

As of Tuesday, McCollough remained in the Duval County jail on $15,000 bond, online jail records show.
